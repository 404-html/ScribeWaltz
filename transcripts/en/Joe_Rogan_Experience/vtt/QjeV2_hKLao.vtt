00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freaks,</v>

<v Speaker 1>is brought to you buy naturebox.</v>

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.430
<v Speaker 1>Naturebox is a company that sends </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier snacks to your door.</v>

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Now I really appreciate my message board</v>
<v Speaker 1>because every time anyone claims </v>

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 1>anything now people fucking crawl up </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ass with a microscope and find out</v>

6
00:00:24.121 --> 00:00:29.121
<v Speaker 1>what's cracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the big things about </v>

7
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:29.121
<v Speaker 1>naturebox is people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff's not healthy.</v>

8
00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about Kale or grapes </v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

9
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or blueberries.</v>

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>It is healthy and quite delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

12
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>what are these things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm smitten with these things.</v>

13
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I may get addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're sweet blueberry almonds.</v>

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so delicious.</v>

15
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what's in there because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have my glasses on.</v>

16
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>I need glasses to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine print.</v>

17
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

18
00:00:50.081 --> 00:00:55.081
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck did they put fine print on </v>
<v Speaker 1>box unpackages where they know that </v>

19
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>anyone over 12 can't read that shit.</v>

20
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

21
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>It puts them print on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's illegal thing they're </v>

22
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>putting print on so that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can get away with it,</v>

23
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>but you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should have it on there.</v>

24
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Where people can fucking read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I asked naturebox what is,</v>

25
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the deal,</v>

26
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it healthy?</v>

27
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>And their response was very reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they said their products are all </v>

28
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.461
<v Speaker 1>natural and containing much higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality ingredients than the typical </v>

29
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>vending machine food ingredients which </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them healthier.</v>

30
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:29.151
<v Speaker 1>They have over 100 snacks to choose from</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're looking for something for </v>

31
00:01:29.151 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>certain dietary needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like wheat free,</v>

32
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

33
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm a gluten free person because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>very trendy,</v>

34
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>a low sugar content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gluten free,</v>

35
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:41.811
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why they had to be </v>

36
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:41.811
<v Speaker 1>redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>they have it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever possible they also try to use </v>

38
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>non gmo food as well.</v>

39
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Although that's a thing about gmo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily unhealthy to eat </v>

40
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>GMO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very tricky anyway.</v>

41
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Their products are made from wholesome </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients.</v>

42
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>And our nutritionist approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They abide by strict quality standards,</v>

43
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.810
<v Speaker 1>no high fructose corn syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no partially hydrogenated oils,</v>

44
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>no trans fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no artificial sweeteners,</v>

45
00:02:06.631 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>no artificial flavors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no artificial colors.</v>

46
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>All sounds good to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I said,</v>

47
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I've been enjoying these snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very delicious.</v>

48
00:02:14.461 --> 00:02:19.461
<v Speaker 1>It's good to have laying around things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't feel terrible about </v>

49
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said,</v>

50
00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>they do have things like pretzels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

51
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:25.440
<v Speaker 1>which are impossible to make healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking pretzels.</v>

52
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was one of the things that was </v>

53
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>brought up on our message board.</v>

<v Speaker 1>O n n I,</v>

120
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:49.081
<v Speaker 1>t on it is a human optimization website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We basically sell things to allow human </v>

121
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:58.051
<v Speaker 1>beings to reach your potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's physically strength and </v>

122
00:05:58.051 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>conditioning equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's cognitively,</v>

123
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>which I don't think is a word through </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like Alpha brain or new mood with</v>

124
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:09.281
<v Speaker 1>new moon is a five htp supplement if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've never heard of five htp five HDP </v>

125
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>is actually a supplement that allows </v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain to build more Serotonin,</v>

126
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>actually can enhance your mood.</v>

127
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.440
<v Speaker 1>So much so that people who are on Ssri </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>

128
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.210
<v Speaker 1>which is a serotonin uptake inhibitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are on antidepressants </v>

129
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.060
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

130
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:31.061
<v Speaker 1>they tell you not to take things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>new mood because new mood and the </v>

131
00:06:31.061 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>antidepressant together might actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you too much.</v>

132
00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>There are Tonin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not good,</v>

133
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.630
<v Speaker 1>but if you're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go all the science behind all the </v>

134
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>supplements are available at [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot com,</v>

135
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Alpha brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's new mood,</v>

136
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>any of the supplements are explained </v>
<v Speaker 1>with science.</v>

137
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And also with the research has posted </v>
<v Speaker 1>with references.</v>

138
00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we recently completed a clinical test.</v>

139
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>The first of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

140
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.240
<v Speaker 1>We were in the process of doing another </v>
<v Speaker 1>one right now.</v>

141
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>A much larger one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one was a pilot test.</v>

142
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:06.050
<v Speaker 1>It was 20 people a couple dropped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think we were left with 17 or 16,</v>

143
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>but we had excellent results and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>results are published at [inaudible] dot</v>

144
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:10.250
<v Speaker 1>com.</v>

145
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's o,</v>
<v Speaker 1>n n I t these are all very expensive to </v>

146
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

147
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of selling supplements is a </v>

148
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>very controversial thing because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of bullshit out there.</v>

149
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I personally believe in supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been taking supplements my whole </v>

150
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not my whole life.</v>

151
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>When I was a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took nothing.</v>

152
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:27.920
<v Speaker 1>How about that took mom's milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess as a supplement.</v>

153
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>But since I knew about vitamins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementation,</v>

154
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 1>I've always been interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimizing my health,</v>

155
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.490
<v Speaker 1>optimizing my fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimizing the way my brain functions.</v>

156
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a big fan of nootropics.</v>

157
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I got turned onto them by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.530
<v Speaker 1>by neuro one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is bill Roman [inaudible] company </v>

159
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:50.530
<v Speaker 1>built Roman house if you don't know who </v>
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>

160
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.451
<v Speaker 1>he's a former pro football player who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was experiencing a lot of what we're </v>

161
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 1>hearing about today in the news about </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro football players.</v>

162
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these guys get busted up from </v>
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>

163
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:05.741
<v Speaker 1>develop a lot of cognitive problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted to combat that with </v>

164
00:08:05.741 --> 00:08:09.311
<v Speaker 1>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he developed a product called </v>

165
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was my introduction to the world of</v>

166
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:12.480
<v Speaker 1>nootropics from um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

167
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Alice from Sarah and no name in San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>

168
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I got into that and then started </v>
<v Speaker 1>researching all the various supplements </v>

169
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 1>before we ever created Alpha brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Alpha brain is what I believe is the</v>

170
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:28.961
<v Speaker 1>best combination of all of the known </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients that can increase cognitive </v>

171
00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:29.450
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

172
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.480
<v Speaker 1>if you go to [inaudible] dot com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the science behind all the </v>

173
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>various ingredients individually is </v>
<v Speaker 1>referenced.</v>

174
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 1>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the,</v>

175
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

176
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:44.050
<v Speaker 1>all the research that we've done and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>study that was just recently completed </v>

177
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.510
<v Speaker 1>is also referenced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have a 100 percent 30 pill,</v>

178
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>90 day money back guarantee it on it.</v>

179
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.110
<v Speaker 1>We're not trying to sell any bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

180
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>the last thing I personally want is </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody feeling ripped off.</v>

181
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 1>That is also the last thing Aubrey </v>

198
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.580

<v Speaker 1>Doo Doo do.</v>

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.500
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed your work over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have had probably one of the most </v>

204
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 1>unique views of Americans as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>outsider.</v>

205
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.450
<v Speaker 1>I think possibly ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 1>your shows are all about.</v>

207
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:11.391
<v Speaker 1>if I wanted to think if I was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy nut and I wanted to thank </v>

<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

209
00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:14.100

<v Speaker 1>an anti American propaganda is what he's</v>

210
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:17.490

<v Speaker 1>ever known and,</v>

211
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:21.390

<v Speaker 1>onto was many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years ago,</v>

215
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:29.870
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

216
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:32.100
<v Speaker 1>I've watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on a marathon last night.</v>

220
00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:44.550
<v Speaker 1>Marathon last night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived to tell the tale.</v>

221
00:10:44.551 --> 00:10:47.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

222
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:52.070
<v Speaker 1>what got you started in exploring all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these bizarre human beings?</v>

223
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.870
<v Speaker 3>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've always,</v>

224
00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.960
<v Speaker 3>I've always had a kind of fascination </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the dark side of human nature and </v>

225
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.910
<v Speaker 3>with lifestyle outsiders and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it goes so deep with me that I don't </v>

226
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.300
<v Speaker 3>remember ever formulating a conscious </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision to explore weirdness.</v>

227
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:13.670
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just came naturally from,</v>

228
00:11:13.671 --> 00:11:14.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from when I was very,</v>

229
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:15.590
<v Speaker 3>very young.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

230
00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I remember my dad having a things about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ku Klux Klan laying around the house</v>

231
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.410
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and reading them and thinking like,</v>

232
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.470
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so weird.</v>

233
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:29.471
<v Speaker 3>And it just sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I used to subscribe to a </v>

234
00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:31.811
<v Speaker 3>magazine called the unexplained that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>all about a conspiracy theories and use </v>

235
00:11:31.811 --> 00:11:35.060
<v Speaker 3>bows and esp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember I subscribe to that.</v>

236
00:11:35.061 --> 00:11:39.770
<v Speaker 3>And so it's always been part of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>natural environment.</v>

237
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.730
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

238
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.850
<v Speaker 3>my dad's American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it felt very natural for me to come </v>

239
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:46.460
<v Speaker 3>to America at a certain point after the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact,</v>

240
00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.520
<v Speaker 3>after I left university.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then once I was here I just felt </v>

241
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 3>like I was tuning into something </v>
<v Speaker 3>different and strange.</v>

242
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a perfect guy for what you've </v>

243
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 1>done because you're so friendly and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>amiable,</v>

244
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:04.060
<v Speaker 1>like when you're around these bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking freaks,</v>

245
00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.380
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put them at ease to a certain </v>

246
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:09.380
<v Speaker 1>extent.</v>

247
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

248
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:09.380
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

249
00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't something I sought out to do </v>

250
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 3>consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

251
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.370
<v Speaker 3>my natural mode is to try and be </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingratiating.</v>

252
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not a confrontational person,</v>

253
00:12:16.831 --> 00:12:19.200
<v Speaker 3>have quite a cowardly person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

254
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

255
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:24.450
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try and avoid conflict and so I have a</v>

256
00:12:24.451 --> 00:12:26.670
<v Speaker 3>natural strategy in life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

257
00:12:26.671 --> 00:12:29.880
<v Speaker 3>it's not something I just do on my </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs in life.</v>

258
00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:31.530
<v Speaker 3>I try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

259
00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:35.040
<v Speaker 3>get along with people and put people at </v>
<v Speaker 3>their ease if possible.</v>

260
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.460
<v Speaker 3>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also have a kind of inquisitive side.</v>

261
00:12:38.461 --> 00:12:43.461
<v Speaker 3>And so sometimes I get my questions </v>
<v Speaker 3>answered by asking a difficult question </v>

262
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 3>politely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

263
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're a coward at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:53.761
<v Speaker 1>I think you're being very self </v>
<v Speaker 1>deprecating right now because you might </v>

265
00:12:53.761 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 1>avoid conflict if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

266
00:12:55.090 --> 00:13:00.090
<v Speaker 1>and I do as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also very brave and the </v>

267
00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>situations that you've put yourself in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:05.640
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've thrust yourself into some very </v>

269
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:05.640
<v Speaker 1>bizarre circumstances.</v>

270
00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

271
00:13:05.651 --> 00:13:06.430
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

272
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:08.330
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am county,</v>

273
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:13.340
<v Speaker 3>but I'm more afraid of the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 3>of I'm somehow not delivering on a </v>

274
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 3>creative idea than I am of the danger </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fulfilling it involves,</v>

275
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:24.721
<v Speaker 3>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So sometimes you're in a spot where the </v>

276
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:24.721
<v Speaker 3>story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

277
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:25.720
<v Speaker 3>people say you must be afraid when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're out on location,</v>

278
00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:27.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I'm afraid of is going home without</v>

279
00:13:27.671 --> 00:13:32.671
<v Speaker 3>a story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's what keeps me awake at </v>

280
00:13:32.671 --> 00:13:34.681
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like are we actually going to get any </v>

281
00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:37.141
<v Speaker 3>usable material?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was in Johannesburg doing a story </v>

282
00:13:37.141 --> 00:13:41.101
<v Speaker 3>on crime in Joburg where the police are </v>
<v Speaker 3>hugely under resourced.</v>

283
00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:45.640
<v Speaker 3>And so a private security agencies go </v>
<v Speaker 3>around policing the streets.</v>

284
00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:47.590
<v Speaker 3>They're heavily armed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're accountable to no one.</v>

285
00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:53.190
<v Speaker 3>And yet after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we went out to do this story and </v>

286
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:55.241
<v Speaker 3>after about two weeks of being there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we hadn't really seen any violent crime </v>

287
00:13:55.241 --> 00:14:00.240
<v Speaker 3>and I was getting to the point of we got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go and cause some crimes ourself if </v>

288
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 3>we have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we got to get the story.</v>

289
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.770
<v Speaker 3>And so there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

290
00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.780
<v Speaker 3>I tended to thrust myself into dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations just out of a sense of panic,</v>

291
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we weren't kind of doing what we </v>

292
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:15.320
<v Speaker 3>were supposed to do.</v>

293
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.380
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially what's going on in South </v>

294
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Africa is like a lot of what happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>where was criticized the American </v>

295
00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:27.141
<v Speaker 1>military started using mercenaries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're accountable to no one black water </v>

296
00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and the like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a huge,</v>

297
00:14:27.931 --> 00:14:32.931
<v Speaker 1>huge issue because these folks were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing a lot of things that if </v>

298
00:14:32.931 --> 00:14:37.010
<v Speaker 1>soldiers had done them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be responsible for war </v>

299
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.090
<v Speaker 1>crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they fell into this very strange and</v>

300
00:14:39.091 --> 00:14:42.330
<v Speaker 1>gray area because they were mercenaries </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was.</v>

301
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

302
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 3>a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in fact we spent a long time looking</v>

303
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:48.080
<v Speaker 3>at trying to do that story and getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>into blackwater.</v>

304
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 3>They rebranded themselves as something </v>
<v Speaker 3>else now,</v>

305
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the fact that these private citizens</v>

306
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.800
<v Speaker 3>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they weren't servants of the </v>

307
00:14:59.800 --> 00:14:59.800
<v Speaker 3>state,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>

308
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:00.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the citizens of private companies,</v>

309
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.610
<v Speaker 3>but they were still in Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but accountable to no government because</v>

310
00:15:04.611 --> 00:15:08.120
<v Speaker 3>they could commit crimes more or less in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iraq,</v>

311
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:13.150
<v Speaker 3>but be a go and arrested and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unprosecuted because they were in this </v>

312
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 3>legal gray area.</v>

313
00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.250
<v Speaker 1>They changed their name twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

314
00:15:15.251 --> 00:15:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Black water was x e dot a dot and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they changed the name to academy with an</v>

315
00:15:20.231 --> 00:15:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I at the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just very strange.</v>

316
00:15:23.381 --> 00:15:28.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think they don't understand the </v>

317
00:15:28.381 --> 00:15:28.381
<v Speaker 1>internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they probably did</v>

318
00:15:28.381 --> 00:15:29.370
<v Speaker 3>figures that may work for people.</v>

319
00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a little bit,</v>

320
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.450
<v Speaker 1>for a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For anybody who doesn't use google.</v>

321
00:15:33.451 --> 00:15:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of work.</v>

322
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 3>That's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why con artists changed their </v>

323
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 3>name.</v>

324
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

325
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that,</v>

326
00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.871
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is how beautiful the Internet </v>

327
00:15:43.871 --> 00:15:43.871
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't remember what the name was.</v>

328
00:15:43.871 --> 00:15:47.651
<v Speaker 1>I found out while you were in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sentence and then by the time you </v>

329
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:47.651
<v Speaker 1>were done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the answer,</v>

330
00:15:47.651 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in strange times.</v>

331
00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who went to blackwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

332
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in the marines.</v>

333
00:15:55.191 --> 00:16:00.191
<v Speaker 1>He was a sniper and then he got a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>with blackwater and he didn't like to </v>

334
00:16:00.191 --> 00:16:01.340
<v Speaker 1>talk about any of this stuff that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

335
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:06.341
<v Speaker 1>but he did it for money and he went over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and made a tremendous amount of money </v>

336
00:16:06.341 --> 00:16:09.760
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did more than one tour with </v>

337
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.810
<v Speaker 1>blackwater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very disturbing that that is,</v>

338
00:16:11.811 --> 00:16:12.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

339
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.740
<v Speaker 1>this gray area and these words that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>use like in surgeon and contractor.</v>

340
00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Those are also disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like contractor,</v>

341
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

342
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a contractor.</v>

343
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a mercenary.</v>

344
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

345
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:31.080
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Contractor contractor to me is the guy </v>

346
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:31.080
<v Speaker 1>who fixes your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

347
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.180
<v Speaker 1>a contract to me as a guy that you hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

348
00:16:32.181 --> 00:16:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he builds a,</v>

349
00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.010
<v Speaker 1>an addition onto your home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fucking sniper,</v>

350
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.150
<v Speaker 3>but it's across the board as well </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

351
00:16:39.151 --> 00:16:40.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done several stories on,</v>

352
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:43.800
<v Speaker 3>on prisons and there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

353
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.410
<v Speaker 3>there are private prisons as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

354
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.750
<v Speaker 3>and if I could make a general </v>
<v Speaker 3>observation,</v>

355
00:16:48.751 --> 00:16:53.751
<v Speaker 3>it's that what I found in the course of </v>
<v Speaker 3>making documentaries is that nine times </v>

356
00:16:53.751 --> 00:16:57.381
<v Speaker 3>out of 10 you get more access and more </v>
<v Speaker 3>accountability from a public agency </v>

357
00:16:57.381 --> 00:17:01.311
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've been inside and spent weeks </v>

358
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:03.981
<v Speaker 3>inside San Quentin prison and Miami jail</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a maximum security mental hospital </v>

359
00:17:04.781 --> 00:17:09.781
<v Speaker 3>for pdf files here in California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And all of those open their doors to us </v>

360
00:17:09.781 --> 00:17:14.600
<v Speaker 3>and I just wonder around and document </v>
<v Speaker 3>what was going on in a way that I </v>

361
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.241
<v Speaker 3>thought was very laudable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't agree with all the practices </v>

362
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:18.720
<v Speaker 3>that were going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And yet if they're private prisons,</v>

363
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:23.950
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel like opening up their </v>

364
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:23.950
<v Speaker 3>doors they've got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't feel the same sense of public</v>

365
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:24.380
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

366
00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.130
<v Speaker 3>that's just a personal observation.</v>

367
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also,</v>

368
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.230
<v Speaker 1>they're a business and that's a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

369
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:34.231
<v Speaker 1>And anything that you say that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative could negatively impact their </v>

370
00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:38.010
<v Speaker 1>bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can make less money because of you </v>

371
00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:38.050
<v Speaker 1>and so there's no benefit in having you </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

372
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the public outrage in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a public institution is to have a </v>

373
00:17:43.451 --> 00:17:44.580
<v Speaker 1>real impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

374
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.580
<v Speaker 1>the public can actually vote to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out of positions that are causing</v>

375
00:17:48.581 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 1>certain rules to be in effect.</v>

376
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:52.490
<v Speaker 4>You can't really do that with private </v>
<v Speaker 4>prisons.</v>

377
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 4>Private prisons are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion,</v>

378
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:59.421
<v Speaker 4>one of the most disturbing aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the current situation that we're in </v>

379
00:17:59.421 --> 00:18:02.520
<v Speaker 4>right now because so few people are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually aware of what's going on.</v>

380
00:18:02.521 --> 00:18:07.521
<v Speaker 4>Most folks who have nine to five jobs </v>
<v Speaker 4>plus whatever commute time and family,</v>

381
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:13.370
<v Speaker 4>they don't have the time to research any</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this stuff and they're really unaware</v>

382
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.160
<v Speaker 4>of what's going on that we have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>good percentage of our prisons in this </v>

383
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:21.600
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this country are actually businesses.</v>

384
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.050
<v Speaker 4>They're making money and even more </v>
<v Speaker 4>disturbing.</v>

385
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:30.290
<v Speaker 4>They're lobbying to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain laws are in place so that they </v>

386
00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Speaker 4>can ensure that they have more people in</v>
<v Speaker 4>their prisons and make more money.</v>

387
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:37.200
<v Speaker 4>It's very creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Scary stuff.</v>

388
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.080
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

389
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.970
<v Speaker 4>You've been to the public prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

390
00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:43.600
<v Speaker 4>and didn't know private prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't be here.</v>

391
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.040
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

392
00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:44.480
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

393
00:18:44.481 --> 00:18:45.790
<v Speaker 4>we've never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's,</v>

394
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:50.890
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can just talk into the alternate </v>

395
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:51.180
<v Speaker 4>towards you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's a story.</v>

396
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 4>I'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

397
00:18:51.991 --> 00:18:52.820
<v Speaker 4>that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

398
00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.860
<v Speaker 4>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a story I'd be interested in </v>

399
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:57.860
<v Speaker 4>telling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

400
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:57.860
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

401
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:57.860
<v Speaker 4>very Hong King.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a,</v>

402
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm a victim of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

403
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.080
<v Speaker 4>of access,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

404
00:19:01.081 --> 00:19:03.530
<v Speaker 4>I can only really tell the stories that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

405
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.790
<v Speaker 4>that I get inside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

406
00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sort of like,</v>

407
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:09.150
<v Speaker 4>well maybe I should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a vampire.</v>

408
00:19:09.151 --> 00:19:10.230
<v Speaker 4>I have to be invited in.</v>

409
00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:16.620
<v Speaker 4>That's only so many a horror movies </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

410
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:22.130
<v Speaker 4>That's my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my issue with the recent trend of </v>

411
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.130
<v Speaker 4>vampires that they just fuck around with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rules.</v>

412
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:27.500
<v Speaker 4>Like blade was the first word the </v>
<v Speaker 4>vampires could wear sunscreen that go </v>

413
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:31.611
<v Speaker 4>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember I wanted a piece of paper up </v>

414
00:19:31.611 --> 00:19:31.611
<v Speaker 4>and threw it at my tv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I saw that,</v>

415
00:19:31.611 --> 00:19:31.750
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

416
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:33.960
<v Speaker 4>I'll fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't fucking wear sunscreen.</v>

417
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.000
<v Speaker 4>You changed the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

418
00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.950
<v Speaker 4>Wesley snipes was a vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

419
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.470
<v Speaker 4>He was half vampire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was a day walker.</v>

420
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:43.080
<v Speaker 4>He was allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to wear sunscreen as well.</v>

421
00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:48.081
<v Speaker 4>He did not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was allowed because he was half </v>

422
00:19:48.081 --> 00:19:48.081
<v Speaker 4>vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a good guest for your show.</v>

423
00:19:48.081 --> 00:19:48.081
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he would.</v>

424
00:19:48.081 --> 00:19:49.050
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would enjoy having.</v>

425
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.060
<v Speaker 4>Is he at?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is he at liberty now?</v>

426
00:19:51.061 --> 00:19:53.250
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was doing time for tax evasion.</v>

427
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what he can say or what he </v>

428
00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.160
<v Speaker 4>would say if I was him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably keep my mouth shut.</v>

429
00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 4>They locked him in a cage for several </v>
<v Speaker 4>years and not only that,</v>

430
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:06.390
<v Speaker 4>they didn't allow him to just pay the </v>
<v Speaker 4>money back.</v>

431
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:10.320
<v Speaker 4>They imprisoned him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is really disturbing to me because</v>

432
00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.560
<v Speaker 4>if someone owes you money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should just have to pay that money </v>

433
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.260
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the government is different when you</v>

434
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:21.261
<v Speaker 4>owe money to the government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they decide that we're going to put you </v>

435
00:20:21.261 --> 00:20:21.261
<v Speaker 4>in a cage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he had gotten a,</v>

436
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.850
<v Speaker 4>I don't know his full story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never met Wesley,</v>

437
00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:27.360
<v Speaker 4>but he had gotten some really shitty </v>
<v Speaker 4>advice from someone.</v>

438
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.480
<v Speaker 4>And if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he was part of a religious </v>

439
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.241
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that side of the story </v>

440
00:20:35.241 --> 00:20:35.241
<v Speaker 4>called the New Orleans?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

441
00:20:35.241 --> 00:20:38.500
<v Speaker 4>there was some kind of Egypt to logical </v>
<v Speaker 4>dimension to it and there's a,</v>

442
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.700
<v Speaker 4>I think there is a pyramid somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside Atlanta and Georgia where they </v>

443
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.200
<v Speaker 4>wish it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does this ring any bells with you?</v>

444
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:51.290
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that his is a secessionist idea </v>

445
00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:51.290
<v Speaker 4>that we don't really belong to the US </v>
<v Speaker 4>state,</v>

446
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.670
<v Speaker 4>that we are our own sovereign in a weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

447
00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:59.671
<v Speaker 4>It kind of aligns with certain aspects </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the sovereign citizen movement where </v>

448
00:20:59.671 --> 00:21:03.331
<v Speaker 4>you see yourself as not beholden to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>federal government and an independent </v>

449
00:21:03.331 --> 00:21:03.331
<v Speaker 4>entity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

450
00:21:03.331 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's his,</v>

451
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.360
<v Speaker 4>his production company was like almond </v>
<v Speaker 4>raw productions.</v>

452
00:21:07.361 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 4>I believe it would make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

453
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 4>He's got a big thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

454
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:16.411
<v Speaker 4>with Egypt and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I believe his thing was </v>

455
00:21:16.411 --> 00:21:18.460
<v Speaker 4>constitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His argument against taxes,</v>

456
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

457
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.420
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of people in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country that state that federal income </v>

458
00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:25.980
<v Speaker 4>tax is actually unconstitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

459
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:27.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was for him,</v>

460
00:21:27.461 --> 00:21:31.660
<v Speaker 4>it was a philosophical position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was or was not.</v>

461
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:34.830
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was a ridiculous position.</v>

462
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.650
<v Speaker 4>He just can't fucking not pay taxes in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this country,</v>

463
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:39.190
<v Speaker 4>this couch.</v>

464
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:40.510
<v Speaker 4>Neat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Without a doubt,</v>

465
00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:43.840
<v Speaker 4>this country is run by by money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without a doubt.</v>

466
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.550
<v Speaker 4>They need money and anyone who comes </v>
<v Speaker 4>along and fucks up that system and says,</v>

467
00:21:48.551 --> 00:21:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

468
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.260
<v Speaker 4>we don't have to give money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

469
00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:51.730
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

470
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.730
<v Speaker 4>what percentage of the United States </v>
<v Speaker 4>runs on taxes?</v>

471
00:21:55.030 --> 00:22:00.030
<v Speaker 4>A pretty large percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If someone comes along and fucks with </v>

472
00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.391
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just going to throw you in a </v>

473
00:22:03.391 --> 00:22:03.391
<v Speaker 4>cage when it doesn't work on kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethical grounds because,</v>

474
00:22:03.391 --> 00:22:04.860
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're driving on the roads,</v>

475
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:10.110
<v Speaker 4>you're using tax dollars and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>pragmatic grounds it doesn't work </v>

476
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:13.651
<v Speaker 4>because they will send you to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A pragmatic grounds of the most </v>

477
00:22:13.651 --> 00:22:13.651
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

478
00:22:13.651 --> 00:22:14.830
<v Speaker 4>the ethical grounds about the roads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

479
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 4>there's a large argument for that for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

480
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:22.110
<v Speaker 4>But then there's also weirdness like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>New York where it used to be that they </v>

481
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:27.181
<v Speaker 4>set up the toll systems on the bridges </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the tunnels and what was going to </v>

482
00:22:27.181 --> 00:22:28.960
<v Speaker 4>happen is once the bridges were paid </v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

483
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:30.400
<v Speaker 4>then the tolls would stop.</v>

484
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:35.790
<v Speaker 4>But the state and the city obviously got</v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted to all that money that keeps </v>

485
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.931
<v Speaker 4>coming in from those tolls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even though the bridges are long </v>

486
00:22:39.931 --> 00:22:39.940
<v Speaker 4>since paid for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they still,</v>

487
00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.030
<v Speaker 4>it still costs like nine bucks every </v>
<v Speaker 4>time you go across whatever the fuck.</v>

488
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:48.031
<v Speaker 4>It's really ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when I was living there it was much </v>

489
00:22:48.031 --> 00:22:48.031
<v Speaker 4>less,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

490
00:22:48.031 --> 00:22:51.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a substantial amount of revenue </v>

491
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:51.900
<v Speaker 4>that they're just not willing to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

492
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 4>So it doesn't matter if it's paid for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the money has to keep coming in.</v>

493
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.560
<v Speaker 4>And then of course the money funds is </v>
<v Speaker 4>bloated bureaucracy that keeps expanding</v>

494
00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:04.561
<v Speaker 4>in order to keep itself alive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like any other organism that continues </v>

495
00:23:04.561 --> 00:23:08.431
<v Speaker 4>to expand and just gets more and more </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous and needs tax money to stay </v>

496
00:23:08.431 --> 00:23:10.120
<v Speaker 4>open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a guy like Wesley snipes,</v>

497
00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:12.040
<v Speaker 4>it comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not paying taxes.</v>

498
00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:17.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for everybody to be </v>

499
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:17.890
<v Speaker 4>sympathetic to that because here's a guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes millions of dollars,</v>

500
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:23.100
<v Speaker 4>doesn't want to pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the regular folks that have to pay </v>

501
00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.211
<v Speaker 4>taxes and make a fraction of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they don't have any sympathy for a </v>

502
00:23:27.211 --> 00:23:30.601
<v Speaker 4>guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Plus he's half vampire indeed.</v>

503
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>indeed.</v>

504
00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.760
<v Speaker 4>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what,</v>

505
00:23:33.761 --> 00:23:35.820
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with his current situations,</v>

506
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.570
<v Speaker 4>I may have a chance to meet him in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dallas.</v>

507
00:23:37.571 --> 00:23:42.571
<v Speaker 4>Apparently there's a martial arts thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is going on in Dallas.</v>

508
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 4>There's a UFC event,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ultimate fighting championship event and</v>

509
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:45.990
<v Speaker 4>there's</v>

510
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.030
<v Speaker 1>also like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that he may attend a,</v>

511
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a chance to meet him.</v>

512
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.970
<v Speaker 1>If I get to talk to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely bring them on here.</v>

513
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:54.740
<v Speaker 1>I was supposed to fight him at one point</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time,</v>

514
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.480
<v Speaker 1>get off how we're supposed to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts fight.</v>

515
00:23:57.481 --> 00:23:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Several years ago before he went into </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail,</v>

516
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:01.130
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

517
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:05.120
<v Speaker 1>he owed a lot of money in taxes and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoter,</v>

518
00:24:05.121 --> 00:24:07.550
<v Speaker 1>one of the original promoters for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate fighting championship.</v>

519
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently he contacted them and wanted </v>

520
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 1>to have a mixed martial arts fight in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make some money.</v>

521
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And they contacted me and offered me </v>
<v Speaker 1>some ridiculous amount of money and I </v>

522
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:19.810
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

523
00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I'll fight that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck that guy for that much money.</v>

524
00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:23.720
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

525
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:28.750
<v Speaker 1>he changed his mind after a time went on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure he was embroiled in legal </v>

526
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:33.521
<v Speaker 1>battles and there might've been some </v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals involved in his decision </v>

527
00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:33.521
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

528
00:24:33.521 --> 00:24:33.980
<v Speaker 1>So have you bought a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

529
00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:39.050
<v Speaker 1>is that something you used to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>taekwondo champion before I was ever a </v>

530
00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 1>standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

531
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I've done martial arts pretty much my </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>

532
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:46.010
<v Speaker 1>I've got a black belt in Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

533
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.040
<v Speaker 1>black belt in taekwondo of kickbox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fought probably a hundred taekwondo </v>

534
00:24:51.861 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 1>matches somewhere around there from age </v>
<v Speaker 1>15 to 21.</v>

535
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:59.810
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much all I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since you've been a,</v>

536
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an older man,</v>

537
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.770
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

538
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

539
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not advisable to do unless it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely necessary.</v>

540
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 1>And I wouldn't do it now if I was given </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same offer,</v>

541
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 1>but back then it was like five or six </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

542
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:14.720
<v Speaker 1>It was a tremendous amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

543
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 1>he's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't know Jujitsu,</v>

544
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't have a background in that </v>

545
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.590
<v Speaker 1>he's experienced and striking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you've never experienced,</v>

546
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:27.650
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have an experience in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in grappling,</v>

547
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:31.580
<v Speaker 1>a person who does have experience in </v>
<v Speaker 1>grappling can pretty much have their way</v>

548
00:25:31.581 --> 00:25:31.970
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>

549
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.970
<v Speaker 1>It's very disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that out firsthand when I first </v>

550
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.680
<v Speaker 1>started taking Jujitsu in 1996.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I knew martial arts,</v>

551
00:25:39.681 --> 00:25:42.680
<v Speaker 1>I was going to take Jujitsu and I'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking awesome at this too.</v>

552
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:48.100
<v Speaker 1>And I just got strangled and manhandled </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over again for years.</v>

553
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal,</v>

554
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 1>painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliating process of learning.</v>

555
00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of exposed in the very first </v>

556
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.010
<v Speaker 1>ultimate fighting championships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't understand grappling,</v>

557
00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:02.960
<v Speaker 1>if you don't understand Jujitsu and </v>
<v Speaker 1>submissions,</v>

558
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.670
<v Speaker 1>you're almost helpless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

559
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.780
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda what I was banking on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was banking on just kind of grabbing </v>

560
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:10.780
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choking him and I,</v>

561
00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.940
<v Speaker 1>my background was standup martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>was striking to.</v>

562
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean I competed and I knew he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>never competed.</v>

563
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.790
<v Speaker 1>He was a trained martial artist who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently really good,</v>

564
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.850
<v Speaker 1>like in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I thought it was probably a good </v>

565
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.570
<v Speaker 1>idea to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like he got off lightly.</v>

566
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean anything can happen when people </v>

567
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:32.590
<v Speaker 1>are throwing punches and kicks out each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

568
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

569
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:38.330
<v Speaker 1>as I've been doing commentary for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC since I started,</v>

570
00:26:38.331 --> 00:26:43.331
<v Speaker 1>I did a post fight interviews in </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 97 and I've done commentary </v>

571
00:26:43.331 --> 00:26:43.990
<v Speaker 1>since 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how</v>

572
00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:44.610
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many,</v>

573
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:49.611
<v Speaker 3>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've learned along the way that </v>

574
00:26:49.611 --> 00:26:49.950
<v Speaker 3>crazy shit can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are throwing bombs at each other.</v>

575
00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:54.951
<v Speaker 3>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>have you ever done a show on mixed </v>

576
00:26:54.951 --> 00:26:54.951
<v Speaker 3>martial arts?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

577
00:26:54.951 --> 00:26:58.370
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting question because we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the few times when knowing </v>

578
00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.020
<v Speaker 3>that we approach a story because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>feels like it should be right for us and</v>

579
00:27:01.021 --> 00:27:02.910
<v Speaker 3>then it doesn't pan out for whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

580
00:27:02.911 --> 00:27:07.911
<v Speaker 3>So I'm well aware of your work with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC and about three years ago we spent a</v>

581
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:13.950
<v Speaker 3>couple of months really trying to crack </v>
<v Speaker 3>it as a story and then what happened was</v>

582
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:18.951
<v Speaker 3>we didn't get what we were trying to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mma and we and we didn't get access to </v>

583
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:24.210
<v Speaker 3>the UFC or not good enough access.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we will look at the second tier,</v>

584
00:27:24.211 --> 00:27:28.920
<v Speaker 3>but it's quite a big drop off from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC down to the smaller leagues.</v>

585
00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:31.770
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy we were dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cold terry,</v>

586
00:27:31.771 --> 00:27:33.000
<v Speaker 3>triple cork.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know him,</v>

587
00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:34.830
<v Speaker 3>you know him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's King of the cage.</v>

588
00:27:34.831 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 3>I always liked that name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was why I remembered it.</v>

589
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trouble cocs coc,</v>

590
00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if we should get together with </v>

591
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 3>Jean tripplehorn ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

592
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:45.450
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

593
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:46.250
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ran it.</v>

594
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember what his league was </v>
<v Speaker 3>called.</v>

595
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what you're thinking of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cage?</v>

596
00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 3>King of the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we spent a bit of time with them.</v>

597
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:57.060
<v Speaker 3>They were doing a series of fights up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>northern Michigan.</v>

598
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was kind of interesting,</v>

599
00:27:59.671 --> 00:28:04.671
<v Speaker 3>but there was another one we would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and part of the same shoot we looked to </v>

600
00:28:04.671 --> 00:28:07.830
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an outfit that I want to say it was cops</v>

601
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 3>versus cons or does that ring a bell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

602
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:11.400
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

603
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's out there though.</v>

604
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.000
<v Speaker 3>And they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did felony fights as well.</v>

605
00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:20.020
<v Speaker 3>You're aware of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they'd sort of cleaned up since </v>

606
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:22.770
<v Speaker 3>felony fights was very brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very hardcore ex felons,</v>

607
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.920
<v Speaker 3>a really wailing on each other in in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that was hard to watch teeth </v>

608
00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:29.760
<v Speaker 3>literally popping out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And have you seen any of those videos?</v>

609
00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:34.770
<v Speaker 3>I saw one where a guy bid a guy's face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>held the man down and bit his face.</v>

610
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.180
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of this horrible,</v>

611
00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:37.950
<v Speaker 3>horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really horrible.</v>

612
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:39.900
<v Speaker 3>The full range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

613
00:28:39.901 --> 00:28:43.830
<v Speaker 3>that's if you have a spectrum of fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's probably the darkest,</v>

614
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.940
<v Speaker 3>but the guy in charge of it had got </v>
<v Speaker 3>religion and he had.</v>

615
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.010
<v Speaker 3>He'd started a new outfit and he sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of.</v>

616
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.860
<v Speaker 3>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in the awkward maneuver of trying</v>

617
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 3>to edge away from the brutal super </v>
<v Speaker 3>brutal,</v>

618
00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:58.890
<v Speaker 3>horrible stuff into a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a lighter mode,</v>

619
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.290
<v Speaker 3>more acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair but without,</v>

620
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 3>but still kind of trying to keep his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brand viable.</v>

621
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:09.390
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and his new thing was called something </v>

622
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.971
<v Speaker 3>like cops versus cons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the concept was it was law </v>

623
00:29:10.971 --> 00:29:13.581
<v Speaker 3>enforcement personnel fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>representatives of the criminal </v>

624
00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:17.480
<v Speaker 3>fraternity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that not ring a bell is going to </v>

625
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:17.480
<v Speaker 3>help him with Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was his.</v>

626
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.840
<v Speaker 3>Because it was like he wants to show how</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

627
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.860
<v Speaker 3>there was some rationale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he wants to show how we can all be </v>

628
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:29.301
<v Speaker 3>on the same team and kind of fight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then shake hands at the end of the day </v>

629
00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:34.170
<v Speaker 3>and there's not a big difference between</v>
<v Speaker 3>cops and the street street brawlers oh,</v>

630
00:29:34.171 --> 00:29:36.660
<v Speaker 3>that sounds like a spin them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a kind of a spin,</v>

631
00:29:36.661 --> 00:29:38.160
<v Speaker 3>but when it got down to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

632
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 3>It was nowhere near as brutal as what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd doing with felony fights.</v>

633
00:29:42.191 --> 00:29:47.191
<v Speaker 3>And the reason we didn't pursue the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story was it became clear that it was </v>

634
00:29:47.191 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 3>actually a sport like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if anything to my mind,</v>

635
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:54.460
<v Speaker 3>and correct me if you think I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but less brutal than boxing,</v>

636
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.150
<v Speaker 3>that you take more punishment because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

637
00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 3>Because boxing bouts for so long and </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly because of the gloves as well,</v>

638
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:06.540
<v Speaker 3>you're getting more brain injuries </v>
<v Speaker 3>through boxing and that compared with </v>

639
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 3>boxing and even maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nfl football and stuff.</v>

640
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.200
<v Speaker 3>That was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't that questionable what the UFC</v>

641
00:30:14.201 --> 00:30:19.201
<v Speaker 3>or the or the mma guys were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just going out there fighting </v>

642
00:30:19.201 --> 00:30:19.500
<v Speaker 3>and then shaking hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands</v>

643
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:24.640
<v Speaker 1>while there are certainly less animosity</v>
<v Speaker 1>between fighters and much more </v>

644
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.410
<v Speaker 1>comradery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

645
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:27.510
<v Speaker 1>two men who were probably two of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best in the world,</v>

646
00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Leo Machida and Chris Weidman who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fight for the UFC.</v>

647
00:30:31.471 --> 00:30:36.471
<v Speaker 1>Middleweight title Weidman is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current champion they met recently at a </v>

648
00:30:36.471 --> 00:30:39.540
<v Speaker 1>seminar or some some convention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a photo of them together,</v>

649
00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:41.970
<v Speaker 1>smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding like arm and arm.</v>

650
00:30:41.971 --> 00:30:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean these guys are in a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

651
00:30:43.861 --> 00:30:48.861
<v Speaker 1>they're going to try to kill each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet they're smiling and very </v>

652
00:30:48.861 --> 00:30:52.821
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very common for people to be </v>

653
00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:54.660
<v Speaker 1>friendly both before and after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights and there's.</v>

654
00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:59.780
<v Speaker 1>With martial arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the true martial art mentality is not </v>

655
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.620
<v Speaker 1>one of thuggish nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not one of it's.</v>

656
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:07.020
<v Speaker 1>There's a photo of those two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the Weidman.</v>

657
00:31:07.021 --> 00:31:12.021
<v Speaker 1>The guy on the left with the monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>milk shirt on is the current champion </v>

658
00:31:12.021 --> 00:31:12.660
<v Speaker 1>and the other Guy Leo Machida.</v>

659
00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:17.220
<v Speaker 1>The one on the right is the number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>contender who's two amazing fighters are</v>

660
00:31:17.221 --> 00:31:21.540
<v Speaker 1>gonna fight and you see them hugging and</v>
<v Speaker 1>smiling before they're about to fight.</v>

661
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:25.050
<v Speaker 1>The Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a wrestler,</v>

662
00:31:25.051 --> 00:31:30.051
<v Speaker 1>which I consider one of the very best </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial arts and Machida is a karate </v>

663
00:31:30.051 --> 00:31:30.900
<v Speaker 1>master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a true martial artists.</v>

664
00:31:30.901 --> 00:31:35.901
<v Speaker 1>Machida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really embodies what you expect from </v>

665
00:31:35.901 --> 00:31:39.930
<v Speaker 1>a martial artist in the bowing he </v>
<v Speaker 1>practices Cada.</v>

666
00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:42.450
<v Speaker 1>He's very disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meditates,</v>

667
00:31:42.451 --> 00:31:44.810
<v Speaker 1>and really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

668
00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:50.030
<v Speaker 1>what you would expect in a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie version of a martial arts </v>

669
00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.000
<v Speaker 1>competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a martial arts master,</v>

670
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:55.230
<v Speaker 1>except he really truly is a real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that attitude,</v>

671
00:31:55.231 --> 00:32:00.231
<v Speaker 1>the martial arts attitude is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the more appealing aspects of </v>

672
00:32:00.631 --> 00:32:03.510
<v Speaker 1>fighting where it's not like a Mike </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson,</v>

673
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of a thuggish,</v>

674
00:32:05.331 --> 00:32:06.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insulting.</v>

675
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:11.690
<v Speaker 1>There's some of that in mma as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very rare and boxing that you </v>

676
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:16.071
<v Speaker 1>get someone who has the martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideals or an ethics that sort of </v>

677
00:32:16.071 --> 00:32:16.071
<v Speaker 1>competes.</v>

678
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.400
<v Speaker 1>But when it comes down to whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more or less dangerous,</v>

679
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.580
<v Speaker 1>it really depends upon the bouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it depends upon the style that a </v>

680
00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.270
<v Speaker 1>person fights in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

681
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.160
<v Speaker 1>if you look at like a floyd mayweather </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>

682
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:32.850
<v Speaker 1>floyd mayweather is probably like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>least hit boxer of all time.</v>

683
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:36.180
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to argue that boxing is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>super safe sport,</v>

684
00:32:36.450 --> 00:32:39.030
<v Speaker 1>watch a floyd mayweather fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch how he fights,</v>

685
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:44.140
<v Speaker 1>rarely gets hit and he gets hit and hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less than mixed martial arts </v>

686
00:32:44.931 --> 00:32:47.900
<v Speaker 1>fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think that his style of fighting</v>

687
00:32:47.901 --> 00:32:50.570
<v Speaker 1>is probably arguably one of the safest </v>
<v Speaker 1>styles ever.</v>

688
00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:56.140
<v Speaker 1>But would martial arts in mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 1>arts provide is more options when a </v>

689
00:32:56.181 --> 00:33:01.181
<v Speaker 1>boxer gets hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not even allowed to hold on and </v>

690
00:33:01.181 --> 00:33:01.181
<v Speaker 1>clinch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with MMA,</v>

691
00:33:01.181 --> 00:33:04.580
<v Speaker 1>that's the number one strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get hit and you get stunned,</v>

692
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:09.760
<v Speaker 1>you grab a hold of your opponent and try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take them to the ground and fight on </v>

693
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 1>the ground and having all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different options,</v>

694
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:14.300
<v Speaker 1>it definitely gives you less a head </v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts,</v>

695
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.480
<v Speaker 1>but not really much less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

696
00:33:17.481 --> 00:33:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's still a lot of standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting involved.</v>

697
00:33:19.861 --> 00:33:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

698
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Is there any evidence of degenerative </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain injury stemming from mma?</v>

699
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:24.940
<v Speaker 1>Most certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

700
00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:28.280
<v Speaker 1>Most certainly from long careers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a lot of training,</v>

701
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 1>hard training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also,</v>

702
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:35.141
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of evolution going on </v>

703
00:33:35.141 --> 00:33:35.930
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in mixed martial arts as far as like</v>

704
00:33:35.931 --> 00:33:40.931
<v Speaker 1>how they train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fighters train and there was a lack </v>

705
00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:43.340
<v Speaker 1>of knowledge and understanding about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>proper way to go about training.</v>

706
00:33:43.341 --> 00:33:48.341
<v Speaker 1>In the old old days when it was first </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting out were people would just try </v>

707
00:33:48.341 --> 00:33:52.451
<v Speaker 1>to be as rough and tough as possible so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would spar in the gym at 100 </v>

708
00:33:52.941 --> 00:33:57.941
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would basically have fights in the </v>

709
00:33:57.941 --> 00:33:57.941
<v Speaker 1>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't just sparring matches,</v>

710
00:33:57.941 --> 00:34:00.110
<v Speaker 1>they were like full on fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your uh,</v>

711
00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:05.130
<v Speaker 1>your mic is on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you do that click is making </v>

712
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:05.130
<v Speaker 1>noise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

713
00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.460
<v Speaker 1>the full on fights where they don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anymore.</v>

714
00:34:07.461 --> 00:34:12.461
<v Speaker 1>Now it's very wise to rarely spar at 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

715
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.280
<v Speaker 1>most of the time spar at a lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lighter impact rate and a much more,</v>

716
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:24.190
<v Speaker 1>much more on technique and much more on </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy and positioning and preserve </v>

717
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.580
<v Speaker 1>yourself inside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

718
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:25.460
<v Speaker 1>inside the gym.</v>

719
00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:29.170
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so as I say,</v>

720
00:34:29.171 --> 00:34:34.171
<v Speaker 3>we abandoned it almost because of it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of feeling like there's the,</v>

721
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:38.070
<v Speaker 3>it seemed healthy and normal in a non,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

722
00:34:38.071 --> 00:34:43.071
<v Speaker 3>like kind of in a masculine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you would only go after it if it was </v>

723
00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:44.080
<v Speaker 3>a freak show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

724
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.130
<v Speaker 3>with that story we needed some extra </v>
<v Speaker 3>dimension.</v>

725
00:34:47.131 --> 00:34:52.131
<v Speaker 3>I know and I think that possibly if we'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>got to the top tier like with the UFC </v>

726
00:34:52.410 --> 00:34:57.410
<v Speaker 3>then that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would have been sufficient sort of </v>

727
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:59.970
<v Speaker 3>show business gloss to it to fee or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or just a sense of stakes.</v>

728
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.040
<v Speaker 3>But the guys we will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were meeting,</v>

729
00:35:02.041 --> 00:35:07.041
<v Speaker 3>we're all part timers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were guys who worked during the </v>

730
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:10.160
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's mechanic's teacher's personal </v>

731
00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.910
<v Speaker 3>trainers and every couple of weekends </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would fight a few bouts.</v>

732
00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.070
<v Speaker 3>So it felt like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't,</v>

733
00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:15.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm not disrespecting them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they were,</v>

734
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.300
<v Speaker 3>they were not full time fighters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was this,</v>

735
00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:22.560
<v Speaker 3>there was missing some kind of sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>scale or something.</v>

736
00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you decided to not pursue the story </v>

737
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.591
<v Speaker 3>left that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spent a few days on it and we </v>

738
00:35:30.591 --> 00:35:30.591
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

739
00:35:30.591 --> 00:35:30.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be that there's a way of coming</v>

740
00:35:30.591 --> 00:35:31.530
<v Speaker 3>back to it at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

741
00:35:31.531 --> 00:35:34.740
<v Speaker 3>the UFC side of it seemed more </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting,</v>

742
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.430
<v Speaker 3>the sense of the personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ways in which intersected</v>

743
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.770
<v Speaker 4>with this multimillion dollar business </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they were running,</v>

744
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.080
<v Speaker 4>that felt maybe more.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

745
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:49.030
<v Speaker 4>and we will look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to find back yard backyard </v>

746
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.030
<v Speaker 4>bounce as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which if you remember a guy called,</v>

747
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 4>there was a guy called data something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

748
00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:54.890
<v Speaker 4>Data five thousand five thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so $3,000.</v>

749
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:59.950
<v Speaker 4>Mother fucker's name was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a scene in Florida have </v>

750
00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:00.510
<v Speaker 4>backyard mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were going to fit into it,</v>

751
00:36:00.511 --> 00:36:02.910
<v Speaker 4>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they call him smokers.</v>

752
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.160
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do they still have smokers?</v>

753
00:36:05.161 --> 00:36:07.590
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They still do like a true smoker,</v>

754
00:36:07.591 --> 00:36:09.250
<v Speaker 4>which is going to be a what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

755
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:11.280
<v Speaker 4>no gloves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of,</v>

756
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:16.281
<v Speaker 4>what is a classic smoker?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kickboxing and boxing is where smokers </v>

757
00:36:16.531 --> 00:36:17.780
<v Speaker 4>really came from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what it is,</v>

758
00:36:17.781 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 4>is essentially fights that would take </v>
<v Speaker 4>place in the gym.</v>

759
00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 4>And what they would do is wear head </v>
<v Speaker 4>gear,</v>

760
00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:24.720
<v Speaker 4>boxing gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sparring gloves,</v>

761
00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:30.050
<v Speaker 4>Shin Pads,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which you don't see in a regular </v>

762
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.050
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing.</v>

763
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:34.310
<v Speaker 4>And they would go at it essentially full</v>
<v Speaker 4>clip in front of family and friends and </v>

764
00:36:34.501 --> 00:36:39.501
<v Speaker 4>it would be unsanctioned amateur bouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem with a lot of these smokers </v>

765
00:36:39.501 --> 00:36:43.641
<v Speaker 4>is there was oftentimes no medical care </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatsoever and they were just,</v>

766
00:36:43.891 --> 00:36:47.010
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hoping that no one got badly injured and</v>

767
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:51.600
<v Speaker 4>regulatory commissions frowned upon them</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they were really competitions,</v>

768
00:36:51.601 --> 00:36:56.040
<v Speaker 4>but they were being labeled as non </v>
<v Speaker 4>competitive sparring,</v>

769
00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:01.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were there were calling them </v>

770
00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.021
<v Speaker 4>sparring bouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I've also had smokers where they had </v>

771
00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:06.270
<v Speaker 4>full mma rules with little gloves and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and no pads at all.</v>

772
00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:11.520
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've done those and I'm sure they've </v>

773
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:11.520
<v Speaker 4>had smokers where they had bare knuckle </v>
<v Speaker 4>fights as well,</v>

774
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:14.250
<v Speaker 4>especially during the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the formative days,</v>

775
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:19.340
<v Speaker 4>like from 93 on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of evolution in mixed </v>

776
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:22.461
<v Speaker 4>martial arts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of things going on and </v>

777
00:37:22.461 --> 00:37:23.100
<v Speaker 4>there was a lot of ways to skirt around </v>
<v Speaker 4>the rules.</v>

778
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Like for the longest time it was illegal</v>
<v Speaker 4>in California.</v>

779
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.870
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the ways king of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cage shine,</v>

780
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:32.871
<v Speaker 4>just because king of the cage would put </v>
<v Speaker 4>on bouts in Indian reservations when </v>

781
00:37:32.871 --> 00:37:33.630
<v Speaker 4>they would go to these native American </v>
<v Speaker 4>reservations.</v>

782
00:37:33.631 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 4>The native American tribes could form </v>
<v Speaker 4>their own rules.</v>

783
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:38.040
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

784
00:37:38.041 --> 00:37:43.041
<v Speaker 4>I went to see a lot of the king of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cage bouts in the nineties and when we </v>

785
00:37:43.041 --> 00:37:47.111
<v Speaker 4>would go see them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were all on native American </v>

786
00:37:47.111 --> 00:37:50.061
<v Speaker 4>reservations.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they also started doing a thing </v>

787
00:37:50.061 --> 00:37:52.821
<v Speaker 4>called pancrase fights and what pancreas</v>
<v Speaker 4>fights where there was this strange </v>

788
00:37:52.821 --> 00:37:56.400
<v Speaker 4>rule,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a loophole where you allowed to fight,</v>

789
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:58.260
<v Speaker 4>but you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could slap,</v>

790
00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:01.260
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't close your fists and punch </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the face,</v>

791
00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.500
<v Speaker 4>but you could pull your hands back and </v>
<v Speaker 4>hit with the palms to the face and then </v>

792
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.180
<v Speaker 4>kick full blast to the face,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kick full blast to the body.</v>

793
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.360
<v Speaker 4>So there was a lot of those fights going</v>
<v Speaker 4>on in the United States as well when </v>

794
00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.471
<v Speaker 4>there was no regulatory body for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just sort of fit into some strange </v>

795
00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:22.440
<v Speaker 4>loophole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But King of the cage is still one of </v>

796
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.070
<v Speaker 4>those places right now where young </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>

797
00:38:23.071 --> 00:38:28.071
<v Speaker 4>when they're looking to get experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they'll start to come up through </v>

798
00:38:28.071 --> 00:38:28.071
<v Speaker 4>that and that's still going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is it?</v>

799
00:38:28.071 --> 00:38:28.440
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

800
00:38:28.441 --> 00:38:33.441
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many bouts that guys </v>

801
00:38:33.441 --> 00:38:33.441
<v Speaker 4>had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terry triple cock used to my,</v>

802
00:38:33.441 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 4>my friend Bud Brotzmann is a good buddy </v>
<v Speaker 4>of mine,</v>

803
00:38:34.561 --> 00:38:37.000
<v Speaker 4>was also one of the original owners of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

804
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:42.390
<v Speaker 4>And he got out and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he became part of shark fights for </v>

805
00:38:42.701 --> 00:38:44.260
<v Speaker 4>awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was another organization,</v>

806
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:45.740
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think he does anything with </v>
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

807
00:38:45.741 --> 00:38:48.040
<v Speaker 4>I may now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but triple cox still going strong.</v>

808
00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:54.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one that we never quite figured </v>

809
00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.671
<v Speaker 3>out was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bare knuckle gypsy fighting it and we,</v>

810
00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you have a sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary cold,</v>

811
00:38:59.020 --> 00:38:59.900
<v Speaker 3>not cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

812
00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:05.450
<v Speaker 3>It's one of my favorite documentaries </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Irish traveler families and the </v>

813
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 3>foods that go on between these families </v>
<v Speaker 3>spending generations is the Joyce family</v>

814
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.860
<v Speaker 3>and another family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can't remember the name,</v>

815
00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:16.960
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the strange dynamic,</v>

816
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:19.780
<v Speaker 3>it's just really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the family,</v>

817
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:23.530
<v Speaker 3>they're very traditional that they got </v>
<v Speaker 3>no money.</v>

818
00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:27.720
<v Speaker 3>They were very close to the soil kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>families and um,</v>

819
00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:33.950
<v Speaker 3>that they issue these like fight videos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like calling each other out into the </v>

820
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:35.590
<v Speaker 3>fight saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come and see me and tell you,</v>

821
00:39:35.591 --> 00:39:37.370
<v Speaker 3>you never instruct me access.</v>

822
00:39:40.290 --> 00:39:42.040
<v Speaker 3>You have no courage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

823
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:47.100
<v Speaker 3>And they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're very secretive and we spent </v>

824
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:47.980
<v Speaker 3>about three or four months trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into that world.</v>

825
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:52.990
<v Speaker 3>I always found it fascinating and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>code of honor and that and the defending</v>

826
00:39:54.491 --> 00:39:59.491
<v Speaker 3>your name and the strangeness of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules whereby there was all these,</v>

827
00:40:00.161 --> 00:40:02.980
<v Speaker 3>this whole code of have rules about if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were called out,</v>

828
00:40:02.981 --> 00:40:04.900
<v Speaker 3>you had to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they insulted your dad,</v>

829
00:40:04.901 --> 00:40:09.901
<v Speaker 3>you have to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the kids getting groomed into </v>

830
00:40:09.901 --> 00:40:12.421
<v Speaker 3>it very young and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we could never build trust with the </v>

831
00:40:12.421 --> 00:40:13.000
<v Speaker 3>families.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the guy who made knuckle,</v>

832
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.220
<v Speaker 3>do you remember how he gets in with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>families?</v>

833
00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:15.670
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

834
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:20.850
<v Speaker 3>He shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gets invited to film one of their </v>

835
00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:21.540
<v Speaker 3>weddings as a videographer and so he </v>
<v Speaker 3>films the wedding.</v>

836
00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.110
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is really interesting.</v>

837
00:40:23.111 --> 00:40:24.370
<v Speaker 3>These families,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are wild.</v>

838
00:40:24.371 --> 00:40:29.371
<v Speaker 3>They can of drinking and fighting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting married and having done one </v>

839
00:40:29.371 --> 00:40:29.500
<v Speaker 3>wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

840
00:40:29.501 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe there's another wedding and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he builds trust through,</v>

841
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.810
<v Speaker 3>through the access,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the wedding videos.</v>

842
00:40:34.811 --> 00:40:37.960
<v Speaker 3>He parlays that into shooting the fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>videos.</v>

843
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.500
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

844
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:41.790
<v Speaker 3>I was glad someone did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

845
00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:46.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really worth if listeners who </v>

846
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:46.920
<v Speaker 3>haven't seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should,</v>

847
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:46.920
<v Speaker 3>should check out.</v>

848
00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fascinating,</v>

849
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:52.801
<v Speaker 4>fascinating documentary and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many of those call out videos that are </v>

850
00:40:52.801 --> 00:40:56.941
<v Speaker 4>available now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They put them up on Youtube now to </v>

851
00:40:56.941 --> 00:40:59.941
<v Speaker 4>really embarrass the person that they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>calling out instead of just a video </v>

852
00:40:59.941 --> 00:41:00.940
<v Speaker 4>where you hand that cassette off to </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else,</v>

853
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:05.941
<v Speaker 4>like in the olden days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now they put these videos up on youtube </v>

854
00:41:05.941 --> 00:41:07.990
<v Speaker 4>and they're their damn hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're beautiful,</v>

855
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:09.950
<v Speaker 3>amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want them to stop.</v>

856
00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Does that exist in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the states,</v>

857
00:41:11.721 --> 00:41:12.860
<v Speaker 3>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the same way</v>

858
00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:13.880
<v Speaker 4>as far as you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

859
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:18.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's probably a few people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have called people out to fights </v>

860
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.290
<v Speaker 4>over the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like travel,</v>

861
00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:20.290
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fights gypsy fight.</v>

862
00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.550
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very different.</v>

863
00:41:21.551 --> 00:41:24.190
<v Speaker 4>It's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a uniquely European thing.</v>

864
00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.630
<v Speaker 4>I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the language they use,</v>

865
00:41:28.631 --> 00:41:33.560
<v Speaker 4>it's just so unique and unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ansys I also feel like that culture,</v>

866
00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:34.160
<v Speaker 4>the Gypsy</v>

867
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.910
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

868
00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:39.020
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a culture that's not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be around too many more generations.</v>

869
00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.320
<v Speaker 3>It's very odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people sometimes ask me what the </v>

870
00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.631
<v Speaker 3>strangest or the most difficult story </v>
<v Speaker 3>have ever done and one of them was </v>

871
00:41:46.631 --> 00:41:51.161
<v Speaker 3>definitely a this gypsy one and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't for lack of a story being at the </v>

872
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:56.921
<v Speaker 3>story was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we just couldn't figure out how to </v>

873
00:41:56.921 --> 00:41:56.921
<v Speaker 3>get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

874
00:41:56.921 --> 00:42:01.750
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was just no sense of you'd be </v>

875
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.750
<v Speaker 3>having these conversations with the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

876
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.820
<v Speaker 3>there was a guy who was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high up in the Gypsy community and </v>

877
00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:08.720
<v Speaker 3>he had a number of sons and he was big </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the fighting world and he was,</v>

878
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.800
<v Speaker 3>he was just connected in various ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both legal and probably not legal and,</v>

879
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:19.180
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you will have conversations with </v>

880
00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:19.180
<v Speaker 3>them and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't figure out what,</v>

881
00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:21.770
<v Speaker 3>what was real and what wasn't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a slight sense of,</v>

882
00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they call non Gypsies Gorgeous.</v>

883
00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.450
<v Speaker 3>That's a phrase they use scorcher </v>
<v Speaker 3>gorgeous.</v>

884
00:42:26.451 --> 00:42:31.451
<v Speaker 3>I think it's Geo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our Gis or maybe I'm in the spellings </v>

885
00:42:31.451 --> 00:42:35.231
<v Speaker 3>could vary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were gorgeous and I always felt </v>

886
00:42:35.231 --> 00:42:35.231
<v Speaker 3>that because we were gorgeous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

887
00:42:35.231 --> 00:42:37.390
<v Speaker 3>non Gypsies that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he is a gypsy,</v>

888
00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:41.240
<v Speaker 3>just felt like no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no real,</v>

889
00:42:41.241 --> 00:42:44.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of needing to tell the truth to us</v>

890
00:42:44.181 --> 00:42:45.350
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

891
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:46.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not trying to generalize.</v>

892
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:51.941
<v Speaker 3>That will be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're say that's true for all Gypsies </v>

893
00:42:51.941 --> 00:42:51.941
<v Speaker 3>are travelers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

894
00:42:51.941 --> 00:42:53.370
<v Speaker 3>but for him it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we were gorgeous if felt like,</v>

895
00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:54.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

896
00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:55.070
<v Speaker 3>we just didn't count.</v>

897
00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it makes sense.</v>

898
00:42:57.271 --> 00:42:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a tight knit culture.</v>

899
00:42:58.861 --> 00:43:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people are living in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>caravans.</v>

900
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Is these a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call those?</v>

901
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:08.620
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't call them trailers that they </v>

902
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:08.620
<v Speaker 1>call them something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

903
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:08.620
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caravans would be,</v>

904
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.380
<v Speaker 1>it would be really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call them caravans and they uh,</v>

905
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.920
<v Speaker 1>what was that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snatch?</v>

906
00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Sort of highlighted it with Brad Pitt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these people,</v>

907
00:43:17.491 --> 00:43:19.050
<v Speaker 1>they travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

908
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:24.320
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they set up shop in places and I have </v>

909
00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:26.931
<v Speaker 1>some friends from England and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends that live in this wealthy </v>

910
00:43:27.541 --> 00:43:32.541
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the suburban community outside of </v>

911
00:43:32.541 --> 00:43:34.971
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these people apparently just moved </v>

912
00:43:34.971 --> 00:43:37.320
<v Speaker 1>into the area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up their caravans,</v>

913
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.680
<v Speaker 1>set up shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just started destroying the area.</v>

914
00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:44.400
<v Speaker 1>They started putting garbage everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started robbing people.</v>

915
00:43:44.401 --> 00:43:45.240
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

916
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:47.400
<v Speaker 1>and they can't do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently.</v>

917
00:43:47.401 --> 00:43:51.050
<v Speaker 1>There's like massive protection of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in,</v>

918
00:43:51.051 --> 00:43:54.210
<v Speaker 1>in England and they're trying to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>polite about it and the way they,</v>

919
00:43:54.211 --> 00:43:57.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go about dealing with the situation</v>

920
00:43:57.511 --> 00:43:59.290
<v Speaker 1>and these folks that lived in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

921
00:43:59.370 --> 00:44:02.100
<v Speaker 1>multimillion dollar estates are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of fucked.</v>

922
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:05.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of these situations where,</v>

923
00:44:05.081 --> 00:44:05.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

924
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:10.670
<v Speaker 3>it's very hard to find the right line </v>
<v Speaker 3>because on the one hand we're talking </v>

925
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.390
<v Speaker 3>about a community that is heavily </v>
<v Speaker 3>discriminated against,</v>

926
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.600
<v Speaker 3>is deeply poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has massive dislocation in various </v>

927
00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.410
<v Speaker 3>respects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high rates of illiteracy,</v>

928
00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:25.690
<v Speaker 3>of Cha children not going to school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the children's health not being good.</v>

929
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:27.340
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

930
00:44:27.341 --> 00:44:29.470
<v Speaker 3>having a massively out of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then at the,</v>

931
00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:30.160
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

932
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:35.610
<v Speaker 3>by all normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so barometers you'd think that's a </v>

933
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:36.630
<v Speaker 3>community that needs help,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also there's various social,</v>

934
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:39.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vices that go along with that.</v>

935
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.960
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so then it's,</v>

936
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:44.420
<v Speaker 3>I think it's fair to say many of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

937
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.440
<v Speaker 3>the traveling folk are not well liked </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

938
00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.500
<v Speaker 3>in rural areas and they are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a cultural thing too where they </v>

939
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.701
<v Speaker 3>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not in our culture to I'm a stay in</v>

940
00:44:55.861 --> 00:44:58.080
<v Speaker 3>one place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to rove around and we have to be</v>

941
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:03.081
<v Speaker 3>allowed to build a house in a field </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're not supposed to build </v>

942
00:45:03.081 --> 00:45:03.081
<v Speaker 3>houses.</v>

943
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.010
<v Speaker 3>So it's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of these,</v>

944
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:10.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can sort of make a cultural </v>

945
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:10.100
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say like,</v>

946
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:10.100
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're culturally,</v>

947
00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.640
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our tradition is,</v>

948
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:12.290
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

949
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:16.530
<v Speaker 3>it's like a native American saying like </v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to be allowed to kill whales,</v>

950
00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

951
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:22.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these debates and there's a </v>

952
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.010
<v Speaker 3>spectrum of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a point where you say like,</v>

953
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:26.031
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your culture to mutilate female </v>

954
00:45:26.031 --> 00:45:28.011
<v Speaker 3>genitalia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still illegal and you can't do </v>

955
00:45:28.011 --> 00:45:30.381
<v Speaker 3>it right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or we say it's your culture to hunt </v>

956
00:45:30.381 --> 00:45:30.381
<v Speaker 3>whales.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

957
00:45:30.381 --> 00:45:32.160
<v Speaker 3>we really want you to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but maybe you can hunt deer instead.</v>

958
00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:33.460
<v Speaker 3>It's our culture to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

959
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:36.280
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to try and find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a trick.</v>

960
00:45:36.570 --> 00:45:37.710
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very tricky.</v>

961
00:45:37.711 --> 00:45:38.000
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

962
00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:43.001
<v Speaker 4>the area about the hunting whales is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very unique one because I believe </v>

963
00:45:43.001 --> 00:45:45.510
<v Speaker 4>there's certain inuit tribes that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>still allowed to hunt.</v>

964
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Certain animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sealed are allowed to hunt seals </v>

965
00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:50.770
<v Speaker 4>and whales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think on nails.</v>

966
00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe some type of Wales.</v>

967
00:45:55.170 --> 00:46:00.170
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in Alaska they allow certain </v>

968
00:46:00.170 --> 00:46:02.661
<v Speaker 4>inuits to hunt certain type of Wales.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a very weird area though,</v>

969
00:46:03.871 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 4>where it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for anyone else,</v>

970
00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 4>it's very illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Frowned upon endangered species.</v>

971
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.230
<v Speaker 4>The fact that they're intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>mammals,</v>

972
00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:12.000
<v Speaker 4>dolphins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't,</v>

973
00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:17.330
<v Speaker 4>but these people that have this long </v>
<v Speaker 4>history of doing that somehow or </v>

974
00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:20.991
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's preserved as a cultural artifact </v>

975
00:46:20.991 --> 00:46:23.100
<v Speaker 4>and it gets very tricky in the female </v>
<v Speaker 4>genitalia.</v>

976
00:46:23.101 --> 00:46:25.410
<v Speaker 4>Mutilation is a very good example of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

977
00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 4>But my friends who are from England,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a horror story of these people that</v>

978
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.560
<v Speaker 4>live in this community that is besieged </v>
<v Speaker 4>by these gypsies.</v>

979
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.560
<v Speaker 4>It's allowed to say Gypsies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gypsies,</v>

980
00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:38.800
<v Speaker 4>like a sort of a negative term.</v>

981
00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.100
<v Speaker 3>I think it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I not,</v>

982
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:43.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure there's a show big show in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain called my big fat gypsy wedding.</v>

983
00:46:43.961 --> 00:46:47.380
<v Speaker 3>So that made me think maybe it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's not.</v>

984
00:46:47.381 --> 00:46:47.890
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

985
00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.080
<v Speaker 4>Some of them have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

986
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.600
<v Speaker 4>the Eskimos one that apparently inuits </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't like the term Eskimo,</v>

987
00:46:54.601 --> 00:46:57.240
<v Speaker 4>but yet they call themselves eskimos </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>

988
00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.650
<v Speaker 4>It's very tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

989
00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:01.170
<v Speaker 4>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

990
00:47:01.310 --> 00:47:04.530
<v Speaker 4>the people that I know that have friends</v>
<v Speaker 4>that live in England,</v>

991
00:47:04.531 --> 00:47:09.531
<v Speaker 4>I mean to them it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this horror story they lived in this </v>

992
00:47:09.531 --> 00:47:13.521
<v Speaker 4>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peaceful countryside is these elegant </v>

993
00:47:13.521 --> 00:47:15.030
<v Speaker 4>manners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful states and multimillion dollar</v>

994
00:47:15.031 --> 00:47:20.031
<v Speaker 4>properties and these people just sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>destroyed it and now people are moving </v>

995
00:47:20.031 --> 00:47:24.861
<v Speaker 4>out and selling their homes and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty devastating according to my </v>

996
00:47:24.861 --> 00:47:24.861
<v Speaker 4>friend.</v>

997
00:47:24.861 --> 00:47:25.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

998
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:26.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to have a law,</v>

999
00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>laws.</v>

1000
00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 3>We do need a few tools.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We certainly do.</v>

1001
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1002
00:47:31.301 --> 00:47:32.340
<v Speaker 4>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1003
00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.810
<v Speaker 4>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where things get strange.</v>

1004
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:37.720
<v Speaker 4>Now what do we accept a clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1005
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:41.020
<v Speaker 4>we moved,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we meaning North Americans,</v>

1006
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:45.100
<v Speaker 4>whoever team here from Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever when they migrated here,</v>

1007
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:49.960
<v Speaker 4>encroached on native American land and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of changed the whole rules.</v>

1008
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:55.350
<v Speaker 4>So what are the rules the remaining and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where this whole Indian </v>

1009
00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:58.660
<v Speaker 4>reservation thing comes into play here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We allowed them to set up shop and these</v>

1010
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 4>areas usually that sucked places that </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1011
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:04.150
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the new people didn't want it all.</v>

1012
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:09.330
<v Speaker 4>They allow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these native Americans have these areas </v>

1013
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.341
<v Speaker 4>and then they allowed them to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>establish their own rules in these </v>

1014
00:48:11.341 --> 00:48:14.131
<v Speaker 4>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then that was fine for the longest </v>

1015
00:48:14.131 --> 00:48:17.611
<v Speaker 4>time and they just sort of lived in </v>
<v Speaker 4>poverty until they started making </v>

1016
00:48:17.611 --> 00:48:20.851
<v Speaker 4>casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it got really strange because then </v>

1017
00:48:20.851 --> 00:48:24.840
<v Speaker 4>non native Americans were allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>invest in these casinos and then they </v>

1018
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:29.071
<v Speaker 4>established these crazy businesses where</v>
<v Speaker 4>they make millions and millions and </v>

1019
00:48:29.071 --> 00:48:30.250
<v Speaker 4>millions of dollars and they allow </v>
<v Speaker 4>gambling,</v>

1020
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 4>which is frowned upon everywhere else.</v>

1021
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.440
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very strange.</v>

1022
00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 3>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another one that I'd like to do a</v>

1023
00:48:38.231 --> 00:48:38.980
<v Speaker 3>story on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't,</v>

1024
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.930
<v Speaker 3>didn't figure out a way of doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1025
00:48:40.931 --> 00:48:45.931
<v Speaker 3>in talking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think what was the realization I had </v>

1026
00:48:45.931 --> 00:48:49.411
<v Speaker 3>was in the end of the stories I do on </v>
<v Speaker 3>about wackiness in my view or even stuff</v>

1027
00:48:53.591 --> 00:48:58.591
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of ethically dubious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although I sometimes go into those </v>

1028
00:48:58.591 --> 00:49:00.410
<v Speaker 3>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more what I'm interested in is,</v>

1029
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:04.120
<v Speaker 3>is it's an angst and the and the deepest</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of,</v>

1030
00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:09.170
<v Speaker 3>of human angst where you are facing </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues the emotionally take you to the </v>

1031
00:49:09.371 --> 00:49:10.570
<v Speaker 3>core of your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your,</v>

1032
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:14.740
<v Speaker 3>of your being and your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in some cases it's,</v>

1033
00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:20.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be stuff that seems kind of </v>

1034
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:20.100
<v Speaker 3>dubious like the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done a story on brothels or I did a</v>

1035
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:25.021
<v Speaker 3>story about porn performers and it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangest of taking the intimacy of the </v>

1036
00:49:25.021 --> 00:49:26.830
<v Speaker 3>sex act and putting it on TV.</v>

1037
00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.320
<v Speaker 3>And then in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other cases,</v>

1038
00:49:29.350 --> 00:49:34.350
<v Speaker 3>it's stories where the angst is </v>
<v Speaker 3>something where you're presented with a </v>

1039
00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:34.850
<v Speaker 3>choice that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1040
00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:37.660
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is really through no fault of yours.</v>

1041
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Like you've got a parent who's got </v>
<v Speaker 3>dementia,</v>

1042
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 3>so a serious Alzheimer's and you or a </v>
<v Speaker 3>loved one,</v>

1043
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:47.260
<v Speaker 3>let's say your husband who you been </v>
<v Speaker 3>married to for 50 years,</v>

1044
00:49:47.261 --> 00:49:51.700
<v Speaker 3>doesn't recognize you anymore and is </v>
<v Speaker 3>having sex at his old people's home with</v>

1045
00:49:51.701 --> 00:49:54.700
<v Speaker 3>some of the other women there are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You still married to him?</v>

1046
00:49:54.701 --> 00:49:57.190
<v Speaker 3>And we did the story about dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1047
00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:58.780
<v Speaker 3>so that's not really about a choice.</v>

1048
00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.820
<v Speaker 4>Old people homes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get down.</v>

1049
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:04.630
<v Speaker 4>What happens is we're in the post </v>
<v Speaker 4>Viagara era.</v>

1050
00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:09.660
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they can get Viagra and the old </v>

1051
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:09.660
<v Speaker 4>people and some of the homes,</v>

1052
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:11.580
<v Speaker 3>as I understand it there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we didn't actually film,</v>

1053
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elderly people having sex.</v>

1054
00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:18.840
<v Speaker 3>But it was clear when one of the women </v>
<v Speaker 3>are spending time with,</v>

1055
00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with visiting her husband of 30 years,</v>

1056
00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:27.890
<v Speaker 3>whenever she visited him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would take one of his new </v>

1057
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.311
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend's out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd go out for a meal and they went </v>

1058
00:50:31.311 --> 00:50:34.631
<v Speaker 3>out as a threesome because he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that he was married to his </v>

1059
00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:36.620
<v Speaker 3>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought he had a new girlfriend.</v>

1060
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:38.380
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1061
00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:43.540
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just taking that as an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I come to this question of why </v>

1062
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.380
<v Speaker 3>didn't the story about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1063
00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the mixed martial arts workout,</v>

1064
00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:55.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it was to do with like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't a great deal of angst </v>

1065
00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.911
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of healthy and people just </v>

1066
00:50:57.911 --> 00:50:58.160
<v Speaker 3>venting a little bit of male aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hm.</v>

1067
00:50:58.550 --> 00:50:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>

1068
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm trying to give you the DNA of.</v>

1069
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 3>We started out by talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>wackiness American culture,</v>

1070
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:10.810
<v Speaker 3>but the DNA for what I do is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is much more about the fundamental </v>

1071
00:51:12.350 --> 00:51:16.950
<v Speaker 3>existential kind of the eras </v>
<v Speaker 3>irresolvable Oh,</v>

1072
00:51:16.951 --> 00:51:18.830
<v Speaker 3>my word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1073
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.920
<v Speaker 3>Let's let it be a word like those sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like those deep complex that we have </v>

1074
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.461
<v Speaker 3>as human beings from which are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>bundled into the whole package of being </v>

1075
00:51:28.671 --> 00:51:32.120
<v Speaker 3>human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you find it limiting in that you have</v>

1076
00:51:32.121 --> 00:51:34.310
<v Speaker 3>to have conflict in order to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>story?</v>

1077
00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.590
<v Speaker 3>Can you have a story where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pursuing conflict and there no either.</v>

1078
00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me the conflict,</v>

1079
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.740
<v Speaker 3>that's what I live for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kinda thrive on,</v>

1080
00:51:43.790 --> 00:51:48.790
<v Speaker 3>on experiencing conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm vicariously through the medium of </v>

1081
00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:52.490
<v Speaker 3>reporting on the stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I couldn't see a story like,</v>

1082
00:51:52.491 --> 00:51:54.560
<v Speaker 3>did you see this film her?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1083
00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I did not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I heard about it.</v>

1084
00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.910
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people love that film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of respect for Spike Jones,</v>

1085
00:51:58.911 --> 00:52:03.570
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't get that film at all </v>
<v Speaker 3>because there was no conflict in it.</v>

1086
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:05.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1087
00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.660
<v Speaker 3>it was just like a love story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a man falls in love with his,</v>

1088
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:14.020
<v Speaker 3>his operating system and then she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she kind of evolves to a higher </v>

1089
00:52:15.021 --> 00:52:18.080
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and a breakup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're just having a lot of cozy.</v>

1090
00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I sort of ruined it for fucking spoiled </v>
<v Speaker 3>it man,</v>

1091
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:23.420
<v Speaker 3>but they kind of have a little cozy </v>
<v Speaker 3>chats and I'm watching things like,</v>

1092
00:52:23.421 --> 00:52:24.690
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm not getting,</v>

1093
00:52:24.691 --> 00:52:26.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When's this going to start?</v>

1094
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:31.840
<v Speaker 3>And I think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it maybe I'm programmed in a different </v>

1095
00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:35.441
<v Speaker 3>way for some people because I could not </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch that film and get white people </v>

1096
00:52:35.441 --> 00:52:39.250
<v Speaker 3>what people were getting out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you require conflict in order to be </v>

1097
00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:39.770
<v Speaker 3>engaged?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1098
00:52:39.771 --> 00:52:42.750
<v Speaker 3>You must have it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1099
00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.160
<v Speaker 3>I found one of the things that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>found really fascinating about your show</v>

1100
00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:50.210
<v Speaker 3>was the episode on Indian Gurus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1101
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:52.610
<v Speaker 3>That was my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1102
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:57.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just so fucking bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The American physicist was the most </v>

1103
00:52:58.881 --> 00:53:02.960
<v Speaker 3>bizarre to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a mike that was a long time,</v>

1104
00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:05.880
<v Speaker 3>I guess Mike from California.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1105
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:08.700
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a Guy Swami,</v>

1106
00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.790
<v Speaker 3>Swami Satchidananda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swamiji love those names.</v>

1107
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Indians have fantastic language.</v>

1108
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:22.210
<v Speaker 3>Their names are amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was this character who is this</v>

1109
00:53:22.371 --> 00:53:26.190
<v Speaker 3>a yoga master,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spiritual</v>

1110
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.890
<v Speaker 4>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever he is without judging.</v>

1111
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:34.310
<v Speaker 4>And there's this guy named Mike who was </v>
<v Speaker 4>a Divo Tay who lived in this guy's </v>

1112
00:53:35.930 --> 00:53:37.200
<v Speaker 4>Ostrom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess,</v>

1113
00:53:37.201 --> 00:53:42.201
<v Speaker 4>and he believed that this man could </v>
<v Speaker 4>materialize jewelry and objects and the </v>

1114
00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:48.381
<v Speaker 4>story of him stomping his foot down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a 50 pound note appeared in his hand.</v>

1115
00:53:49.051 --> 00:53:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's a fucking physicist.</v>

1116
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just so strange.</v>

1117
00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:56.190
<v Speaker 4>That was a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was my favorite,</v>

1118
00:53:56.220 --> 00:54:01.220
<v Speaker 4>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my favorite moments was you </v>

1119
00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:04.010
<v Speaker 4>sitting on the edge of the bed talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>to him and you asked him whether or not </v>

1120
00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.000
<v Speaker 4>you said try not to take this the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1121
00:54:06.001 --> 00:54:10.530
<v Speaker 4>but did you have sadness in your life </v>
<v Speaker 4>before you,</v>

1122
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:12.390
<v Speaker 4>before you met the sky?</v>

1123
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.930
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1124
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:21.230
<v Speaker 3>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he took it a myths and he didn't like </v>

1125
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.690
<v Speaker 3>that question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1126
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:25.800
<v Speaker 3>he said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said something like,</v>

1127
00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:27.500
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I,</v>

1128
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.310
<v Speaker 3>are you asking me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1129
00:54:29.311 --> 00:54:34.311
<v Speaker 3>am I a burnout and burnout?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this quote was fascinating because </v>

1130
00:54:34.311 --> 00:54:35.520
<v Speaker 3>it was about fundamentalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1131
00:54:35.521 --> 00:54:37.110
<v Speaker 3>He says like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say that,</v>

1132
00:54:37.111 --> 00:54:38.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a breakdown is the,</v>

1133
00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:43.820
<v Speaker 3>is like the precursor to fundamentalism </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I thought he was going to say that </v>

1134
00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:44.240
<v Speaker 3>he had a break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1135
00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:47.730
<v Speaker 3>So I sort of went with the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what he said,</v>

1136
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.310
<v Speaker 3>I thought like he was setting me up for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1137
00:54:50.311 --> 00:54:53.220
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't see himself as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamentalist and I'm.</v>

1138
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:54.870
<v Speaker 3>It was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a misunderstanding.</v>

1139
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:59.871
<v Speaker 3>I normally try and get into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult questions a little more </v>

1140
00:54:59.871 --> 00:55:02.010
<v Speaker 3>gracefully and because I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood what he was saying.</v>

1141
00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:02.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you did.</v>

1142
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.160
<v Speaker 3>I slid into it a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't think you did.</v>

1143
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 3>I think he changed gears,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think?</v>

1144
00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he was sort of happened.</v>

1145
00:55:09.571 --> 00:55:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Like the deep story there is that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>spent.</v>

1146
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:13.740
<v Speaker 3>That was weird weekends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>

1147
00:55:13.741 --> 00:55:16.500
<v Speaker 3>which was about 10 years ago and I used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to try and spend.</v>

1148
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.740
<v Speaker 3>It was like a little rule of thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd find a contributor who I could </v>

1149
00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.861
<v Speaker 3>relate to the most.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you take something that seemed </v>

1150
00:55:24.861 --> 00:55:27.201
<v Speaker 3>really out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that on the face of it you </v>

1151
00:55:27.201 --> 00:55:29.781
<v Speaker 3>think that how could people really think</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's cool to move to Idaho and not pay </v>

1152
00:55:29.781 --> 00:55:31.380
<v Speaker 3>taxes and think the UN is going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>invade.</v>

1153
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:36.410
<v Speaker 3>How could people really think that an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian guru is going to manifest rolex </v>

1154
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:41.211
<v Speaker 3>watches?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call them cities by meditating and </v>

1155
00:55:41.211 --> 00:55:42.390
<v Speaker 3>cure cancer by jamming on a keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

1156
00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.240
<v Speaker 3>and an old bon tempe keyboard and so.</v>

1157
00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:46.090
<v Speaker 3>But the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>

1158
00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.990
<v Speaker 3>The technique we used was to try and </v>
<v Speaker 3>find the most likable,</v>

1159
00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:52.950
<v Speaker 3>reasonable seeming person who </v>
<v Speaker 3>exemplified that belief system.</v>

1160
00:55:53.130 --> 00:55:58.130
<v Speaker 3>So you was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take a weird subject but cost it </v>

1161
00:55:58.130 --> 00:56:01.761
<v Speaker 3>normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like cast it a person who's likable and </v>

1162
00:56:01.761 --> 00:56:04.311
<v Speaker 3>relatable and Mike was the guy we </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought and when you found that guy and </v>

1163
00:56:04.311 --> 00:56:04.311
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'll move it,</v>

1164
00:56:04.311 --> 00:56:05.250
<v Speaker 3>I'll spend the night with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

1165
00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:08.400
<v Speaker 3>it was like supposed to signal my </v>
<v Speaker 3>commitment to the story as well.</v>

1166
00:56:08.670 --> 00:56:13.670
<v Speaker 3>So in that story I spent the night at </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike's Ashram and um,</v>

1167
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.040
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1168
00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:17.220
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had very thin mattresses,</v>

1169
00:56:17.221 --> 00:56:22.221
<v Speaker 3>although I later found out there were </v>
<v Speaker 3>different thicknesses depending on how </v>

1170
00:56:22.221 --> 00:56:25.701
<v Speaker 3>committed you were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would choose a thinner mattress so </v>

1171
00:56:25.701 --> 00:56:28.861
<v Speaker 3>you can choose a thick when buying real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just found a thin one so I put it on </v>

1172
00:56:28.861 --> 00:56:32.680
<v Speaker 3>and I had one of the worst nights of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep in my life and I woke up the next </v>

1173
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.060
<v Speaker 3>morning kind of groggy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as you are offering night's sleep,</v>

1174
00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.860
<v Speaker 3>not just going to have bad tempered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also just my ci wasn't flowing right</v>

1175
00:56:38.861 --> 00:56:43.861
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't in tune with what was going on </v>

1176
00:56:43.861 --> 00:56:43.861
<v Speaker 3>around me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when he asked,</v>

1177
00:56:43.861 --> 00:56:45.830
<v Speaker 3>he said something about if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1178
00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:50.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you fundamentalists because you've </v>

1179
00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:50.840
<v Speaker 3>had a breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

1180
00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:50.840
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's saying he had a breakdown.</v>

1181
00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:53.200
<v Speaker 3>I think so did you have some sadness in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life?</v>

1182
00:56:53.201 --> 00:56:54.040
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1183
00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:54.210
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1184
00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:57.290
<v Speaker 4>let's play that and you can find that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can find that Jamie,</v>

1185
00:56:57.291 --> 00:57:02.291
<v Speaker 4>it's that video that you just showed if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you back up about three or four minutes </v>

1186
00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:06.311
<v Speaker 4>before that find it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is you'll see louis getting out of bed </v>

1187
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:08.630
<v Speaker 4>and he looks very groggy and then he </v>
<v Speaker 4>communicates with this guy and they have</v>

1188
00:57:08.631 --> 00:57:08.810
<v Speaker 4>this</v>

1189
00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:13.850
<v Speaker 3>sort of a weird breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also the one where I try and call </v>

1190
00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:16.470
<v Speaker 3>because then the guru says he's a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>fan of siegfried and Roy or David </v>

1191
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Copperfield.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says he went to Vegas and I took that</v>

1192
00:57:18.831 --> 00:57:23.831
<v Speaker 3>as a kind of slightly very subtle coded </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible admission that he takes an </v>

1193
00:57:24.531 --> 00:57:28.160
<v Speaker 3>interest in magic and therefore what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does is it kind of conjuring.</v>

1194
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:30.950
<v Speaker 3>So I sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to edge towards getting him</v>

1195
00:57:30.951 --> 00:57:33.230
<v Speaker 3>to admit that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1196
00:57:33.231 --> 00:57:38.231
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that you can't make a Rolex </v>

1197
00:57:38.231 --> 00:57:38.240
<v Speaker 3>watch appear out of thin air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1198
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:43.510
<v Speaker 3>And so why not just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just get that out there and admit </v>

1199
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:44.120
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you do.</v>

1200
00:57:44.121 --> 00:57:46.100
<v Speaker 3>But he's a guru so he couldn't really </v>
<v Speaker 3>admit it.</v>

1201
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a</v>

1202
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

1203
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.290
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's working on a cosmic level.</v>

1204
00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:06.360
<v Speaker 5>Don't take this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't take this the wrong way.</v>

1205
00:58:06.361 --> 00:58:11.361
<v Speaker 5>Mine who was there any sadness in your </v>
<v Speaker 5>life before you came to see the Swami </v>

1206
00:58:11.361 --> 00:58:16.291
<v Speaker 5>and committed to him?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've always have a little saying </v>

1207
00:58:16.291 --> 00:58:19.980
<v Speaker 5>fundamentalism is the aftermath of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>nervous breakdown when,</v>

1208
00:58:20.410 --> 00:58:22.350
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a little bit of course,</v>

1209
00:58:22.351 --> 00:58:27.351
<v Speaker 5>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you ever break come up with that </v>

1210
00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:31.930
<v Speaker 5>please?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1211
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:32.760
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

1212
00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:35.570
<v Speaker 5>I like um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1213
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:36.930
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1214
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:40.460
<v Speaker 4>she pauses all this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1215
00:58:40.461 --> 00:58:41.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1216
00:58:41.071 --> 00:58:41.810
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1217
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.840
<v Speaker 4>then he goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think these are all tells.</v>

1218
00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:52.750
<v Speaker 4>I think he changed gears on you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really think his statement,</v>

1219
00:58:52.751 --> 00:58:54.730
<v Speaker 4>his initial statement,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalism and,</v>

1220
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.990
<v Speaker 4>and you know about nervous breakdowns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what he's really saying.</v>

1221
00:58:59.190 --> 00:59:00.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

1222
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:03.430
<v Speaker 4>And then when you confront him on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he realizes he's on camera.</v>

1223
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:04.770
<v Speaker 4>That's why the all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1224
00:59:04.771 --> 00:59:05.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1225
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:10.500
<v Speaker 4>he's thinking too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to come up with a way to </v>

1226
00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:10.630
<v Speaker 4>spin that story in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a better light.</v>

1227
00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:13.540
<v Speaker 4>He's not just free flowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on in his mind.</v>

1228
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:17.440
<v Speaker 4>He's dancing around the subject trying </v>
<v Speaker 4>to wrestle it into a more acceptable,</v>

1229
00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:18.880
<v Speaker 4>palatable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

1230
00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:23.030
<v Speaker 3>I created it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think what I see my take it is he,</v>

1231
00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.990
<v Speaker 3>he's emotionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1232
00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:30.410
<v Speaker 3>close to the surface and probably has </v>
<v Speaker 3>been through a lot of difficult things.</v>

1233
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:31.850
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1234
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean I getting dangerously close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of diagnosing him,</v>

1235
00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in absentia.</v>

1236
00:59:36.951 --> 00:59:38.180
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1237
00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:39.380
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think,</v>

1238
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:42.020
<v Speaker 3>but I also think he's trying to step </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside it.</v>

1239
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:44.150
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you like,</v>

1240
00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:47.780
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I don't think he thinks that he did</v>

1241
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:48.860
<v Speaker 3>have a breakdown.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1242
00:59:48.861 --> 00:59:50.420
<v Speaker 3>it could be bought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's trying to play it off.</v>

1243
00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1244
00:59:50.981 --> 00:59:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe he was a lovely guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

1245
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:55.040
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was from the bay area.</v>

1246
00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:55.730
<v Speaker 3>I hope he's doing okay.</v>

1247
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like a very nice guy,</v>

1248
00:59:57.221 --> 00:59:59.080
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the interesting aspects </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

1249
00:59:59.081 --> 01:00:04.081
<v Speaker 1>He also seemed fairly intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also claimed to be a total </v>

1250
01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:04.900
<v Speaker 1>complete scan</v>

1251
01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:05.650
<v Speaker 3>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look,</v>

1252
01:00:05.651 --> 01:00:06.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isaac,</v>

1253
01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't want to go on a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>lecture,</v>

1254
01:00:08.221 --> 01:00:10.750
<v Speaker 3>but Isaac Newton believed in Alchemy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1255
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:11.560
<v Speaker 3>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1256
01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 3>And spent the last 20 years of his life </v>
<v Speaker 3>having made probably the most important </v>

1257
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:20.440
<v Speaker 3>scientific breakthroughs of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last 20 years of his life,</v>

1258
01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:25.560
<v Speaker 3>kind of calculating the dimensions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Noah's Ark based on biblical </v>

1259
01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.240
<v Speaker 3>information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1260
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:31.260
<v Speaker 3>just Wacko stuff and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and believed in the philosopher's stone </v>

1261
01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:31.260
<v Speaker 3>and the idea of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1262
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:32.740
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1263
01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:37.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly surprised and the ways in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which your rationality or what we can </v>

1264
01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:40.930
<v Speaker 3>choose to think of is rationality can </v>
<v Speaker 3>coexist with rationality.</v>

1265
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Sir Isaac Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he also have an issue with </v>

1266
01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>sexuality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe?</v>

1267
01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I believe he was asexual.</v>

1268
01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:53.130
<v Speaker 3>The light that he was pretty weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a pretty weird dude and then at </v>

1269
01:00:53.130 --> 01:00:57.540
<v Speaker 3>the same time it may have taken someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a certain credulity or,</v>

1270
01:00:59.371 --> 01:01:01.020
<v Speaker 3>or like a willingness to believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1271
01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.250
<v Speaker 3>occult forces to come up with the notion</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1272
01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:07.780
<v Speaker 3>of gravitational pull through a vacuum </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a distance.</v>

1273
01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:08.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1274
01:01:08.951 --> 01:01:10.600
<v Speaker 3>until then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1275
01:01:10.601 --> 01:01:13.390
<v Speaker 3>they'd been grappling with science as </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanistic,</v>

1276
01:01:13.391 --> 01:01:13.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in other words,</v>

1277
01:01:13.931 --> 01:01:17.950
<v Speaker 3>don't say gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing explains why gravity exists.</v>

1278
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1279
01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.080
<v Speaker 3>why do objects attract one another at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>distance through,</v>

1280
01:01:23.081 --> 01:01:26.230
<v Speaker 3>through a vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just do like,</v>

1281
01:01:26.231 --> 01:01:30.580
<v Speaker 3>there's no prior cause before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in a strange way,</v>

1282
01:01:30.581 --> 01:01:34.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his mind may have been predisposed.</v>

1283
01:01:34.511 --> 01:01:35.120
<v Speaker 3>Am I going to it?</v>

1284
01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1285
01:01:36.061 --> 01:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think there's anything.</v>

1286
01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously he's not,</v>

1287
01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe he's correct about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alchemy,</v>

1288
01:01:41.371 --> 01:01:46.371
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're dealing with a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when information was so limited that he </v>

1289
01:01:46.371 --> 01:01:51.291
<v Speaker 1>might have thought that he was onto </v>
<v Speaker 1>something the same way he was on the </v>

1290
01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:54.081
<v Speaker 1>gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might have thought that there was </v>

1291
01:01:54.081 --> 01:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a scientific basis to </v>
<v Speaker 1>alchemy that he just couldn't hunt down.</v>

1292
01:01:56.410 --> 01:01:57.070
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

1293
01:01:57.071 --> 01:01:58.240
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1294
01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:03.250
<v Speaker 3>and at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the paradigm of science in the 17th </v>

1295
01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.761
<v Speaker 3>century was that I'm all that nonsense </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they used to believe in the Middle </v>

1296
01:02:06.370 --> 01:02:11.370
<v Speaker 3>Ages was nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you didn't have an even </v>

1297
01:02:11.370 --> 01:02:14.101
<v Speaker 3>Aristotelian ideas of things going up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything could be explained </v>

1298
01:02:14.101 --> 01:02:16.720
<v Speaker 3>mechanistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a mechanistic that objects banged</v>

1299
01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:18.460
<v Speaker 3>into each other and that's why things </v>
<v Speaker 3>moved.</v>

1300
01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:19.710
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1301
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 4>it took a leap of faith to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1302
01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:27.051
<v Speaker 4>maybe objects move each other are </v>
<v Speaker 4>through forces that are invisible and </v>

1303
01:02:27.051 --> 01:02:30.861
<v Speaker 4>can't really be explained well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also important to note that most </v>

1304
01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 4>scientists were religious back then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guess most scientists were Christians.</v>

1305
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.280
<v Speaker 4>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a or Islamic,</v>

1306
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was very common to be a Christian.</v>

1307
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:44.280
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very uncommon to be an atheist.</v>

1308
01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1309
01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.410
<v Speaker 4>anyone espousing atheistic ideas was </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought to be a fucking nut.</v>

1310
01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:54.740
<v Speaker 4>Which is really interesting today where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you look at the vast majority of </v>

1311
01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:55.020
<v Speaker 4>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1312
01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:58.980
<v Speaker 4>huge percentage of them either are </v>
<v Speaker 4>agnostic or claim to be atheists.</v>

1313
01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:01.410
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it would be comparable to saying</v>

1314
01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:03.420
<v Speaker 4>nowadays saying I'm a pedophile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1315
01:03:03.421 --> 01:03:08.421
<v Speaker 4>I think actually being an atheist in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>17th century was so outside the norm of </v>

1316
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:12.060
<v Speaker 4>what people considered acceptable or it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1317
01:03:12.061 --> 01:03:13.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the only way we could get</v>

1318
01:03:13.981 --> 01:03:17.970
<v Speaker 4>our brains around thinking you would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>shunned.</v>

1319
01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.910
<v Speaker 4>People would look at you and think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is wrong with you?</v>

1320
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:23.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was just taken for granted,</v>

1321
01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:24.640
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1322
01:03:24.641 --> 01:03:27.090
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in all levels of acceptable society.</v>

1323
01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:27.940
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1324
01:03:28.260 --> 01:03:33.060
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting just going back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into our past just recent past,</v>

1325
01:03:33.061 --> 01:03:38.061
<v Speaker 1>so we have with recordings and </v>
<v Speaker 1>television and watching how different </v>

1326
01:03:38.161 --> 01:03:43.161
<v Speaker 1>our culture is from today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say from the 19 twenties and 19 </v>

1327
01:03:43.161 --> 01:03:44.070
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even films from the,</v>

1328
01:03:44.071 --> 01:03:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 forties and fifties,</v>

1329
01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:47.100
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they very.</v>

1330
01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:52.250
<v Speaker 1>So there's so much of a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a standup comedian and when I go </v>

1331
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:56.541
<v Speaker 1>back and I listened to the standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedians of the 19 fifties in the 19 </v>

1332
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:56.541
<v Speaker 1>sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1333
01:03:56.541 --> 01:04:00.921
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible how much different </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture is between now and then.</v>

1334
01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:06.620
<v Speaker 1>The greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the most important comedian </v>

1335
01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:06.620
<v Speaker 1>ever is lenny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce,</v>

1336
01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:10.520
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you try to listen to Lenny Bruce </v>

1337
01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:10.520
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really not funny.</v>

1338
01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:11.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1339
01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not funny and it's almost blast for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to say,</v>

1340
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:19.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true because our culture has </v>

1341
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:21.840
<v Speaker 1>changed so much since then that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just not relevant anymore.</v>

1342
01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:24.030
<v Speaker 1>The things that he's saying and the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>he sang them,</v>

1343
01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:24.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1344
01:04:24.891 --> 01:04:26.940
<v Speaker 1>the humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shockingness of it.</v>

1345
01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Then it's so normal today.</v>

1346
01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.090
<v Speaker 4>Do you find any old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like do you find the Marx brothers funny</v>

1347
01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:37.350
<v Speaker 4>or chaplain or there's some physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy that's still pretty funny.</v>

1348
01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if it was new it would suck.</v>

1349
01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:42.900
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it was released today,</v>

1350
01:04:42.901 --> 01:04:44.960
<v Speaker 4>if someone tried to release a three </v>
<v Speaker 4>stooges movie today,</v>

1351
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:49.990
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a piece of shit and that's a </v>

1352
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:49.990
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1353
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:51.660
<v Speaker 4>I have great respect for the three </v>
<v Speaker 4>stooges.</v>

1354
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:52.260
<v Speaker 4>Sounds crazy</v>

1355
01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:53.610
<v Speaker 1>decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

1356
01:04:53.660 --> 01:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1357
01:04:56.440 --> 01:05:01.440
<v Speaker 1>it's an evidence of the references.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our culture is just extremely different </v>

1358
01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:06.211
<v Speaker 1>now and I think that's one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging aspects of trying to look </v>

1359
01:05:06.851 --> 01:05:11.851
<v Speaker 1>back on the 16 hundreds and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine what life was like trying to go </v>

1360
01:05:12.371 --> 01:05:17.371
<v Speaker 1>back to the days when they used to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to put skirts on table legs because were</v>

1361
01:05:17.411 --> 01:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>thinking that people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually attracted to a table,</v>

1362
01:05:20.771 --> 01:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>legs and piano and it's hard for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to imagine that that was a real thing.</v>

1363
01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:30.740
<v Speaker 3>What about thinking of 100 years in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>future and what will look back on now as</v>

1364
01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:35.460
<v Speaker 3>a culturally weird that we take for </v>
<v Speaker 3>granted?</v>

1365
01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:36.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there'll be so much.</v>

1366
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.890
<v Speaker 3>There'll be so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would it be?</v>

1367
01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1368
01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.850
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of contradictions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have in our society.</v>

1369
01:05:41.851 --> 01:05:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think first of all,</v>

1370
01:05:44.971 --> 01:05:46.950
<v Speaker 1>the way people dress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be bizarre.</v>

1371
01:05:46.951 --> 01:05:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Women's high heels will be laughed at </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's high heels.</v>

1372
01:05:50.611 --> 01:05:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Like when you see women walk around with</v>
<v Speaker 1>spikes,</v>

1373
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when women love wearing stilettos </v>

1374
01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:00.231
<v Speaker 1>and pumps and all these really bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet distorting shoewear or footwear,</v>

1375
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things it's </v>

1376
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:07.181
<v Speaker 1>going to be looked back upon ties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People look back on ties the way they </v>

1377
01:06:07.181 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 1>looked at powdered wigs from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1378
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Washington era.</v>

1379
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.710
<v Speaker 3>So strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1380
01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:17.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and racism was normal in the 19th </v>

1381
01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:20.471
<v Speaker 3>century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even someone like Lincoln who we </v>

1382
01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:20.960
<v Speaker 3>think of as being a hero of the civil </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights struggle,</v>

1383
01:06:20.961 --> 01:06:22.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>freeing the slaves,</v>

1384
01:06:22.191 --> 01:06:27.191
<v Speaker 3>the emancipation proclamation made a </v>
<v Speaker 3>number of deeply racist statements,</v>

1385
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:28.150
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1386
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world was different.</v>

1387
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.210
<v Speaker 1>The way they looked at the world was </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

1388
01:06:33.211 --> 01:06:34.260
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>

1389
01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:39.530
<v Speaker 3>And have you followed the whole story in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Britain about show business celebrities </v>

1390
01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:44.551
<v Speaker 3>being a accused of sex crimes based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior in the 19 seventies?</v>

1391
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Did I followed that whole thing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that one guy who was that famous talk </v>

1392
01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>show host Jimmy Savile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1393
01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking crazy.</v>

1394
01:06:55.491 --> 01:07:00.491
<v Speaker 1>That guy was a pedophile and apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>for decades and it was covered up much </v>

1395
01:07:01.761 --> 01:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>like the Jerry Sandusky case in America </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of folks are aware of that.</v>

1396
01:07:06.081 --> 01:07:07.870
<v Speaker 1>The Pennsylvania State,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1397
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:12.910
<v Speaker 1>the guy who is a coach football coach </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was just a massive pedophile and </v>

1398
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>they covered it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they covered it up so much,</v>

1399
01:07:14.841 --> 01:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know if you're familiar with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that case,</v>

1400
01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:21.671
<v Speaker 1>but the DA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy who was the prosecutor was </v>

1401
01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:23.030
<v Speaker 1>trying to try to find out information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turned up missing.</v>

1402
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>He turned up missing and they found his </v>
<v Speaker 1>laptop and a river with no hard drive.</v>

1403
01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:32.680
<v Speaker 1>They killed that fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They killed the guy that is </v>

1404
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.050
<v Speaker 1>investigating Jerry Sandusky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone did.</v>

1405
01:07:33.260 --> 01:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>And he would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1406
01:07:33.861 --> 01:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>why would someone do that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about a pedophile?</v>

1407
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:41.340
<v Speaker 1>But then you find out how much money the</v>
<v Speaker 1>school makes and the school makes from </v>

1408
01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:45.581
<v Speaker 1>their football program the school makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from people who went to that school who </v>

1409
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:47.960
<v Speaker 1>donate to the school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's an insane amount of money.</v>

1410
01:07:47.961 --> 01:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>It's hundreds and hundreds of millions </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dollars.</v>

1411
01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:54.350
<v Speaker 3>But did you know that I was the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>person who,</v>

1412
01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:59.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who lived with Jimmy savile on it's on </v>

1413
01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:00.410
<v Speaker 3>and off for two weeks and made a </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary about him?</v>

1414
01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:03.270
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2000 you could find that on,</v>

1415
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:05.780
<v Speaker 3>on Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that like?</v>

1416
01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's see.</v>

1417
01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 3>It's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's been a matter of a lot of soul </v>

1418
01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:11.500
<v Speaker 3>searching for me because of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1419
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:16.190
<v Speaker 3>because of the strangeness of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>discovering that he had track record of,</v>

1420
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.610
<v Speaker 3>of apparently sexually abusing where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>that keen and excited.</v>

1421
01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:20.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>goodness,</v>

1422
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.360
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking and it just appears.</v>

1423
01:08:24.730 --> 01:08:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So go ahead place on the difference </v>

1424
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.330
<v Speaker 3>between us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should be able to do something.</v>

1425
01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.860
<v Speaker 3>When Louis met Jimmy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

1426
01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.590
<v Speaker 3>you spent two weeks with that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>More or less?</v>

1427
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>off and on over the,</v>

1428
01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:45.791
<v Speaker 3>over about three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three or four months of miserable </v>

1429
01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:45.791
<v Speaker 3>Americans who were not aware of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story at all.</v>

1430
01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:47.630
<v Speaker 3>It's not a very popular story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Explain who he is.</v>

1431
01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:52.631
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no exact cultural figure in </v>

1432
01:08:52.631 --> 01:08:53.290
<v Speaker 3>America to compare him with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was mainly known as,</v>

1433
01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:58.470
<v Speaker 3>as a DJ and from the late sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right through to the nineties,</v>

1434
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.120
<v Speaker 3>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just on the radio a lot and then </v>

1435
01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.561
<v Speaker 3>he got a TV show on the back of his Dj </v>
<v Speaker 3>career where it was called Jibo fix it </v>

1436
01:09:08.561 --> 01:09:11.980
<v Speaker 3>and people would call in with requests </v>
<v Speaker 3>for special fixits,</v>

1437
01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 3>which were dreams that he would make </v>
<v Speaker 3>come true for them.</v>

1438
01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:19.370
<v Speaker 3>So kids would say I've always wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a box with a big bulk,</v>

1439
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:20.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meet Mohammed Ali or,</v>

1440
01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:24.890
<v Speaker 3>or drive a Ferrari or um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>

1441
01:09:25.350 --> 01:09:28.270
<v Speaker 3>a dance with shorty know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like just,</v>

1442
01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:33.460
<v Speaker 3>and they would come on and he would fix </v>
<v Speaker 3>it for them to do the things that was a </v>

1443
01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 3>very popular mainstream TV show for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1444
01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:39.610
<v Speaker 3>And I'm all to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone in Britain knew who he was and </v>

1445
01:09:39.610 --> 01:09:42.170
<v Speaker 3>he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very in his appearance was very odd.</v>

1446
01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see him there,</v>

1447
01:09:43.281 --> 01:09:46.430
<v Speaker 3>but even more so in his younger years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had this helmet of hair.</v>

1448
01:09:46.431 --> 01:09:51.431
<v Speaker 3>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always looked at him and thought </v>

1449
01:09:51.431 --> 01:09:51.431
<v Speaker 3>cottage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks really hard,</v>

1450
01:09:51.431 --> 01:09:54.320
<v Speaker 3>like something not right about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time he became a knight,</v>

1451
01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:57.230
<v Speaker 3>he was very well as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the establishment.</v>

1452
01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:58.640
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1453
01:09:58.700 --> 01:09:59.660
<v Speaker 3>became a night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1454
01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:04.340
<v Speaker 3>he was knighted for any raised millions </v>
<v Speaker 3>and millions of dollars for a pounds for</v>

1455
01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:07.790
<v Speaker 3>charity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he like this unique cultural figure.</v>

1456
01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:12.791
<v Speaker 3>And then after he died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turned out that he had sexually </v>

1457
01:10:12.791 --> 01:10:13.810
<v Speaker 3>assaulted a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of women and um,</v>

1458
01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:17.360
<v Speaker 3>many of them were under age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a women thing.</v>

1459
01:10:17.361 --> 01:10:19.520
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was boys as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1460
01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.640
<v Speaker 3>there's that that's been alleged and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know,</v>

1461
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all this stuff,</v>

1462
01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:29.381
<v Speaker 3>the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not kind of been completely </v>

1463
01:10:29.381 --> 01:10:30.730
<v Speaker 3>established because he hasn't been know </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's dead.</v>

1464
01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.760
<v Speaker 3>He can't be tried in court.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But some men have stepped forward and </v>

1465
01:10:36.111 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 3>said that they were abused by him when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were children.</v>

1466
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:40.730
<v Speaker 3>So it was all children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boys and girls.</v>

1467
01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:45.770
<v Speaker 3>When you say it was some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the people who who said they </v>

1468
01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:50.771
<v Speaker 3>were assaulted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said it happened when they were in </v>

1469
01:10:50.771 --> 01:10:50.771
<v Speaker 3>their thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties.</v>

1470
01:10:50.771 --> 01:10:55.241
<v Speaker 3>And then if he had a victim profile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems to have been younger teens.</v>

1471
01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:58.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1472
01:10:58.041 --> 01:10:59.990
<v Speaker 3>so that's a whole other can of worms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

1473
01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.650
<v Speaker 3>since you mentioned it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1474
01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:04.480
<v Speaker 3>I felt I should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say you,</v>

1475
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:09.550
<v Speaker 3>I mentioned that had a connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what was your experience when you </v>

1476
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.550
<v Speaker 3>were with them for two weeks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1477
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 3>there was a scene in the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should play this bit of today.</v>

1478
01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:15.740
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1479
01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:18.960
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't bother with anybody else,</v>

1480
01:11:18.961 --> 01:11:19.860
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1481
01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:20.490
<v Speaker 4>never,</v>

1482
01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:25.060
<v Speaker 3>never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even for like a week.</v>

1483
01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.160
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even probation.</v>

1484
01:11:26.190 --> 01:11:31.190
<v Speaker 4>So he's saying he never had a girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 4>go me meaning he wants to fuck other </v>

1485
01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:33.430
<v Speaker 4>people and he says don't bother with </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else</v>

1486
01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.800
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he's saying.</v>

1487
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:37.750
<v Speaker 3>He's saying that I've never had a </v>
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend.</v>

1488
01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:42.751
<v Speaker 3>I've only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only kind of flitted from girl to </v>

1489
01:11:42.751 --> 01:11:44.950
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says friends that are girls,</v>

1490
01:11:45.010 --> 01:11:46.840
<v Speaker 3>thousands of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but girlfriend.</v>

1491
01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:49.000
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like 70 there.</v>

1492
01:11:49.060 --> 01:11:50.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

1493
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:53.740
<v Speaker 3>So I didn't really even at that time I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

1494
01:11:53.741 --> 01:11:54.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1495
01:11:54.131 --> 01:11:58.660
<v Speaker 3>you decoded that straight away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the time I wasn't really sure exactly</v>

1496
01:11:58.661 --> 01:12:00.100
<v Speaker 3>what he was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1497
01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:05.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think because like he'd been </v>

1498
01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.221
<v Speaker 3>so confusing and he said so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things about the nature,</v>

1499
01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean he'd been so evasive on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>subject and if,</v>

1500
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:12.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1501
01:12:12.611 --> 01:12:17.611
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's saying now that he had lots of </v>

1502
01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:17.611
<v Speaker 3>different girls who he would sleep with,</v>

1503
01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:22.720
<v Speaker 4>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this line of conversation leads me </v>

1504
01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:22.720
<v Speaker 4>to believe that you were suspicious </v>
<v Speaker 4>about him that</v>

1505
01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:26.760
<v Speaker 3>knew that it was well known that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1506
01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.680
<v Speaker 3>let's say it was well known that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that his interests were unclear.</v>

1507
01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:32.820
<v Speaker 3>Like in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was well known.</v>

1508
01:12:32.821 --> 01:12:35.310
<v Speaker 3>There was a mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that no one ever.</v>

1509
01:12:35.311 --> 01:12:37.590
<v Speaker 3>If people always say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are his interest?</v>

1510
01:12:37.591 --> 01:12:41.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's never had a girlfriend or a wife or</v>

1511
01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:44.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe he's gay or maybe he is.</v>

1512
01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.490
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe he's a sexual.</v>

1513
01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:52.080
<v Speaker 3>And I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I knew that there was a blank spot,</v>

1514
01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:54.750
<v Speaker 3>like a gray area space where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1515
01:12:54.751 --> 01:12:55.350
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

1516
01:12:55.351 --> 01:12:58.030
<v Speaker 3>he kept his sexuality kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1517
01:12:58.170 --> 01:13:00.870
<v Speaker 3>and if you questioned him on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1518
01:13:00.970 --> 01:13:03.270
<v Speaker 3>it was clear there was a secret.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't quite know what.</v>

1519
01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.350
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what the secret was and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there were rumors of him being attracted</v>

1520
01:13:07.351 --> 01:13:09.300
<v Speaker 3>to underage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>underage girls.</v>

1521
01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Was one of the rumors.</v>

1522
01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:15.860
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is not something that just </v>

1523
01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:16.830
<v Speaker 4>dropped after he died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was something that was,</v>

1524
01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:20.040
<v Speaker 4>was it because of the fact that he did </v>
<v Speaker 4>so much charitable work?</v>

1525
01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:24.290
<v Speaker 4>Was it difficult to question him because</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that he was knighted that</v>

1526
01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:27.090
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I never felt inhibited from,</v>

1527
01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:28.800
<v Speaker 3>from asking tough questions.</v>

1528
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:31.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't know that's your nature was</v>

1529
01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:33.530
<v Speaker 4>culture where they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll</v>

1530
01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:34.660
<v Speaker 3>truly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1531
01:13:34.661 --> 01:13:37.900
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's emerging now is that there was an</v>

1532
01:13:37.901 --> 01:13:39.970
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of protection.</v>

1533
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:45.320
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't like a memo that went out </v>

1534
01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.540
<v Speaker 3>saying don't touch him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He does a lot of work for charity.</v>

1535
01:13:46.541 --> 01:13:51.541
<v Speaker 3>But there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was an atmosphere of a feeling </v>

1536
01:13:51.541 --> 01:13:52.190
<v Speaker 3>that he was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1537
01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.710
<v Speaker 3>doing good works for charity and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>a vip.</v>

1538
01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.680
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think abuse victims,</v>

1539
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:05.740
<v Speaker 3>even when it's not a celebrity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of pressure on them not to</v>

1540
01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:09.970
<v Speaker 3>come forward due to embarrassment and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>misplaced sense of guilt.</v>

1541
01:14:10.670 --> 01:14:12.190
<v Speaker 3>And when it's a</v>

1542
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.200
<v Speaker 4>prominent member of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

1543
01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.370
<v Speaker 4>of the celebrity world who's viewed as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>

1544
01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:20.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1545
01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:21.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a benevolent,</v>

1546
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:23.760
<v Speaker 4>a philanthropist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1547
01:14:23.761 --> 01:14:25.060
<v Speaker 4>even more so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1548
01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:27.070
<v Speaker 4>that was the issue with Sandusky as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1549
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:32.071
<v Speaker 4>that he worked in charities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>charitable organizations that helped a </v>

1550
01:14:32.071 --> 01:14:35.911
<v Speaker 4>lot of young kids that were orphans and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he took a lot of these young kids on </v>

1551
01:14:37.211 --> 01:14:41.410
<v Speaker 4>trips and this was apparently when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>had sexually molested them,</v>

1552
01:14:41.411 --> 01:14:42.610
<v Speaker 4>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What have you.</v>

1553
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:45.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he's ever admitted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>any of this,</v>

1554
01:14:45.071 --> 01:14:47.980
<v Speaker 4>but of course he's obviously he's guilty</v>
<v Speaker 4>of something.</v>

1555
01:14:48.330 --> 01:14:53.330
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was his thing that he had </v>

1556
01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:56.101
<v Speaker 4>helped all these kids and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in all these charitable </v>

1557
01:14:56.101 --> 01:14:59.371
<v Speaker 4>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was suspicions about him and </v>

1558
01:14:59.371 --> 01:15:02.230
<v Speaker 4>there was stories about him for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and someone had protected him.</v>

1559
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:07.231
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is the reason why they had </v>
<v Speaker 4>protected him was because it would take </v>

1560
01:15:07.231 --> 01:15:10.870
<v Speaker 4>down penn state this enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a money making machine.</v>

1561
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:12.840
<v Speaker 4>This huge cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1562
01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:16.840
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a huge business.</v>

1563
01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:19.870
<v Speaker 4>And it was also like a big part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

1564
01:15:20.180 --> 01:15:22.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Penn State is this institution,</v>

1565
01:15:22.491 --> 01:15:27.491
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this established institution that would </v>

1566
01:15:27.491 --> 01:15:29.170
<v Speaker 4>be brought down by this and victims had </v>
<v Speaker 4>come forward.</v>

1567
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And gone to the police or,</v>

1568
01:15:32.311 --> 01:15:37.311
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or gone to the university authorities </v>

1569
01:15:37.311 --> 01:15:37.311
<v Speaker 4>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>

1570
01:15:37.311 --> 01:15:38.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my friend Dom I rera is actually friends</v>

1571
01:15:38.681 --> 01:15:39.990
<v Speaker 4>with the prosecutor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1572
01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:44.530
<v Speaker 4>the one who chased him down at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the guy that turned up missing,</v>

1573
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:49.690
<v Speaker 4>but one of the ones who was involved at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the very end when he did wind up getting</v>

1574
01:15:49.691 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 4>prosecuted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>

1575
01:15:50.501 --> 01:15:51.700
<v Speaker 4>he's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's in jail now,</v>

1576
01:15:51.701 --> 01:15:53.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Sent Dusky?</v>

1577
01:15:53.561 --> 01:15:54.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's in jail.</v>

1578
01:15:54.701 --> 01:15:57.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing is very disgusting,</v>

1579
01:15:57.821 --> 01:16:02.821
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so disturbing to think that they </v>

1580
01:16:02.821 --> 01:16:04.150
<v Speaker 4>protected him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that was the whole thing about this</v>

1581
01:16:04.151 --> 01:16:08.830
<v Speaker 4>joe paternal character who was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the much was the legendary coach,</v>

1582
01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:11.110
<v Speaker 4>legendary coach who knew what was going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>

1583
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:12.280
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1584
01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:13.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Allegedly knew,</v>

1585
01:16:14.090 --> 01:16:15.910
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he took early retirement.</v>

1586
01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:18.790
<v Speaker 4>He died very quickly afterwards too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:23.791
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the news was just absolutely </v>

1588
01:16:23.791 --> 01:16:23.791
<v Speaker 4>devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when he was,</v>

1589
01:16:23.791 --> 01:16:25.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he took early retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe he was removed.</v>

1590
01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I believe he was removed as a coach and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's when everybody went crazy.</v>

1591
01:16:30.251 --> 01:16:35.251
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was like riots when they removed </v>

1592
01:16:35.251 --> 01:16:37.021
<v Speaker 4>him as the coach and then the news came </v>
<v Speaker 4>out and then when the news came out </v>

1593
01:16:37.021 --> 01:16:37.900
<v Speaker 4>everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh fuck.</v>

1594
01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:39.830
<v Speaker 4>And then he died shortly afterwards and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1595
01:16:39.831 --> 01:16:44.831
<v Speaker 4>I would probably safely say that a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason why he died was not just old age.</v>

1596
01:16:46.511 --> 01:16:51.511
<v Speaker 4>That devastating effect of this all </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming public was probably just </v>

1597
01:16:51.511 --> 01:16:54.910
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably hard to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>

1598
01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:59.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not minimizing what happened to those </v>

1599
01:16:59.911 --> 01:16:59.911
<v Speaker 4>kids is much more difficult for them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with it.</v>

1600
01:16:59.911 --> 01:17:01.330
<v Speaker 4>It's the whole thing is just totally </v>
<v Speaker 4>disgusting,</v>

1601
01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.540
<v Speaker 4>but fascinating in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange,</v>

1602
01:17:04.541 --> 01:17:07.810
<v Speaker 4>bizarre way that human beings are </v>
<v Speaker 4>capable of doing something like that,</v>

1603
01:17:07.960 --> 01:17:10.270
<v Speaker 4>that they're capable of shielding this </v>
<v Speaker 4>monster.</v>

1604
01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:11.580
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1605
01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.800
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1606
01:17:13.830 --> 01:17:14.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1607
01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:17.130
<v Speaker 3>but I'm curious about the fact that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoyed the,</v>

1608
01:17:17.150 --> 01:17:19.500
<v Speaker 3>the guru story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1609
01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:20.210
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1610
01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:25.230
<v Speaker 3>because I look back at that and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>one that I would feel is kind of one of </v>

1611
01:17:25.831 --> 01:17:28.740
<v Speaker 3>my finest moments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it.</v>

1612
01:17:29.370 --> 01:17:34.370
<v Speaker 4>I love the part where you met the woman </v>
<v Speaker 4>who is this guy or this female guru,</v>

1613
01:17:34.841 --> 01:17:35.530
<v Speaker 4>and she hugged me</v>

1614
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:40.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had a sort of transcendental </v>

1615
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:40.810
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened there?</v>

1616
01:17:40.810 --> 01:17:41.560
<v Speaker 3>What was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1617
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:43.270
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

1618
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I think,</v>

1619
01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:47.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a male way,</v>

1620
01:17:47.871 --> 01:17:51.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that connected to like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deepest sources of my,</v>

1621
01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:55.580
<v Speaker 3>of my emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't really know what it was,</v>

1622
01:17:55.581 --> 01:18:00.080
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that being hogged is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very simple and it's a physical act,</v>

1623
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:00.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1624
01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:01.550
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

1625
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:05.030
<v Speaker 3>it creates all kinds of emotions inside </v>
<v Speaker 3>of you.</v>

1626
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:07.970
<v Speaker 3>And it just sort of welled up from </v>
<v Speaker 3>nowhere.</v>

1627
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:13.000
<v Speaker 3>It was just really odd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know exactly what </v>

1628
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:13.000
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

1629
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:13.000
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought about that quite a bit after I</v>

1630
01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.741
<v Speaker 4>watched it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I took from </v>

1631
01:18:17.741 --> 01:18:20.261
<v Speaker 4>it was the emotions and just the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>group of people waiting in line to hug </v>

1632
01:18:21.621 --> 01:18:26.621
<v Speaker 4>someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The anticipation of it and the love </v>

1633
01:18:26.621 --> 01:18:29.471
<v Speaker 4>that's in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's sort of this group minded thing </v>

1634
01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:29.471
<v Speaker 4>that's going on</v>

1635
01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:30.130
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of music,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loud music.</v>

1636
01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.100
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1637
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:36.610
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a very heightened atmosphere and</v>

1638
01:18:36.611 --> 01:18:38.680
<v Speaker 3>then she gave me a sort of turbo hug </v>
<v Speaker 3>too,</v>

1639
01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:43.681
<v Speaker 3>like she gave me the executive platinum </v>
<v Speaker 3>card hug and I think they whispered to </v>

1640
01:18:43.991 --> 01:18:47.050
<v Speaker 3>her like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give this guy the works.</v>

1641
01:18:49.150 --> 01:18:54.150
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so she hugged me for longer and she was </v>

1642
01:18:54.150 --> 01:18:55.240
<v Speaker 3>actually muttering things into my ear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was she saying?</v>

1643
01:18:55.770 --> 01:18:57.460
<v Speaker 3>Not Words that I recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like,</v>

1644
01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.060
<v Speaker 3>it was sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1645
01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.610
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it comforting noises?</v>

1646
01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.430
<v Speaker 3>That's the word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Poon job is the word for their language,</v>

1647
01:19:09.431 --> 01:19:09.790
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1648
01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:14.791
<v Speaker 3>there's several languages spoken Hindi </v>
<v Speaker 3>or I'm this or there's a few others,</v>

1649
01:19:15.130 --> 01:19:16.600
<v Speaker 3>too many to mention.</v>

1650
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:21.990
<v Speaker 4>I would think that just the experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>itself of being around all those people </v>

1651
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:26.551
<v Speaker 4>that were in this sort of dancing joyous</v>
<v Speaker 4>state in this long line to get to this </v>

1652
01:19:26.651 --> 01:19:31.651
<v Speaker 4>woman and she probably had some sincere </v>
<v Speaker 4>loving gesture towards everyone as well.</v>

1653
01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:38.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you imagine what it would be like to be </v>

1654
01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:41.011
<v Speaker 4>adored by so many people in such a large</v>
<v Speaker 4>group of people that are established </v>

1655
01:19:41.011 --> 01:19:43.870
<v Speaker 4>there to come see you and get in line to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hug you or then you did it and.</v>

1656
01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:45.730
<v Speaker 4>But you are really like movies.</v>

1657
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.670
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1658
01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:51.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think as well I was under a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of pressure when I'm doing those </v>

1659
01:19:51.730 --> 01:19:54.410
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel very pent up and I'm aware that I</v>

1660
01:19:54.411 --> 01:19:58.570
<v Speaker 3>have one chance to kind of get the thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I'm trying to get and we.</v>

1661
01:19:58.930 --> 01:20:02.780
<v Speaker 3>It was one of those classic things where</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was supposed to hug her the day before</v>

1662
01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:07.560
<v Speaker 3>and then we took a crew break and went </v>
<v Speaker 3>for an Indian meal and then when arrived</v>

1663
01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 3>at the hugging tent that packed up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>left and I was like,</v>

1664
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we missed the hug and then it turned out</v>

1665
01:20:14.341 --> 01:20:19.341
<v Speaker 3>she was doing two nights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was doing like two dates in that </v>

1666
01:20:19.341 --> 01:20:20.010
<v Speaker 3>city because she was on tour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hugging her way around India.</v>

1667
01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.290
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1668
01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 3>we're fucked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We can get the hug now just because like</v>

1669
01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:27.030
<v Speaker 3>our crew wanted a nice meal and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1670
01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:28.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1671
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:31.040
<v Speaker 3>and so I got to here another night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was,</v>

1672
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.200
<v Speaker 3>it was this long lead up to getting the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hug.</v>

1673
01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:37.740
<v Speaker 3>It's always a tightly wound coil of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of anxiety.</v>

1674
01:20:37.741 --> 01:20:39.690
<v Speaker 3>So when I finally got there and had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hug,</v>

1675
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:43.680
<v Speaker 3>it was a several levels on which I felt </v>
<v Speaker 3>just sort of relieved.</v>

1676
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fascinating.</v>

1677
01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.420
<v Speaker 1>That's fascinating.</v>

1678
01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:48.420
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religions,</v>

1679
01:20:48.421 --> 01:20:53.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of life's life's mysteries and </v>

1680
01:20:53.421 --> 01:20:56.661
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to do a thing on scientology </v>

1681
01:20:56.661 --> 01:21:00.510
<v Speaker 3>at the moment and that's proven quite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite a difficult road.</v>

1682
01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion is certainly,</v>

1683
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:05.000
<v Speaker 1>it certainly is one of life's great </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries,</v>

1684
01:21:05.001 --> 01:21:10.001
<v Speaker 1>but I think there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also group states have like </v>

1685
01:21:10.001 --> 01:21:14.101
<v Speaker 1>mindedness that I find quite fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could get them when the people.</v>

1686
01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I was at a military base once it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC fight for the troops and uh,</v>

1687
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:22.610
<v Speaker 1>they sang the national anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in the middle of the Iraq war.</v>

1688
01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:24.830
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1689
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:25.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1690
01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:30.880
<v Speaker 1>when they sang the national anthem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intensity and the feeling in the </v>

1691
01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:33.200
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriotism,</v>

1692
01:21:33.201 --> 01:21:33.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1693
01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:39.220
<v Speaker 1>just the emotions involved in you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with thousands of people in the </v>

1694
01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:42.410
<v Speaker 1>audience who have lost loved ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost friends,</v>

1695
01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe been wounded themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may be taken lives themselves.</v>

1696
01:21:46.191 --> 01:21:48.350
<v Speaker 1>Many of them have shore taken lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1697
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:50.090
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1698
01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:55.100
<v Speaker 1>the palpable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriotism and the emotion and the </v>

1699
01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:57.320
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a person who was absolutely against</v>

1700
01:21:57.470 --> 01:22:00.500
<v Speaker 1>all of these wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the Iraq invasion,</v>

1701
01:22:00.501 --> 01:22:01.670
<v Speaker 1>the Afghanistan war.</v>

1702
01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:03.890
<v Speaker 1>I thought the whole thing was about </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1703
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:09.130
<v Speaker 1>And the whole thing was ill advised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that the idea of going in for </v>

1704
01:22:09.130 --> 01:22:12.470
<v Speaker 1>these supposed weapons of mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction was incredibly transparent.</v>

1705
01:22:12.471 --> 01:22:17.471
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought that the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the military industrial complex was </v>

1706
01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:19.310
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing on a horrible event in </v>
<v Speaker 1>September 11th.</v>

1707
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.810
<v Speaker 1>And using that as an impetus to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>invade these countries and,</v>

1708
01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:25.470
<v Speaker 1>and take over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1709
01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:30.880
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that moment when that thing was </v>

1710
01:22:31.101 --> 01:22:36.101
<v Speaker 1>happening and that person was singing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the national anthem was a soldier that </v>

1711
01:22:36.101 --> 01:22:39.470
<v Speaker 1>was singing the national anthem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone was standing there proud.</v>

1712
01:22:39.471 --> 01:22:44.420
<v Speaker 1>And the energy in the air and they cheer</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was over ready to go to war.</v>

1713
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are ready to support the troops.</v>

1714
01:22:46.581 --> 01:22:49.130
<v Speaker 1>You're ready to not just support the </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops but support the war.</v>

1715
01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.050
<v Speaker 1>You're ready to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to back them.</v>

1716
01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:54.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this weird thing that happens.</v>

1717
01:22:54.081 --> 01:22:57.620
<v Speaker 1>These group minded sort of states that.</v>

1718
01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:01.360
<v Speaker 3>So did you get into a kind of altered </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness in that moment?</v>

1719
01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 3>I felt something for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you feel I could have easily if I,</v>

1720
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.950
<v Speaker 3>if I</v>

1721
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.830
<v Speaker 4>coached myself into it or if I entertain</v>
<v Speaker 4>those thoughts,</v>

1722
01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:10.900
<v Speaker 4>let it go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you'd gone with the feeling.</v>

1723
01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was working at the time I was,</v>

1724
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:13.660
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1725
01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:17.520
<v Speaker 4>I was there for the ultimate fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>championship and um,</v>

1726
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:21.070
<v Speaker 4>but the state of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1727
01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:26.080
<v Speaker 4>the group state was fucking intense and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

1728
01:23:26.170 --> 01:23:28.870
<v Speaker 4>it was palpable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was tangible.</v>

1729
01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.450
<v Speaker 4>It was in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1730
01:23:31.451 --> 01:23:35.950
<v Speaker 4>this is coming from a person who I </v>
<v Speaker 4>believe that it's very important to have</v>

1731
01:23:35.951 --> 01:23:40.951
<v Speaker 4>military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that there are bad people in </v>

1732
01:23:40.951 --> 01:23:43.201
<v Speaker 4>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that there's sometimes no </v>

1733
01:23:43.201 --> 01:23:46.951
<v Speaker 4>other solutions mean I don't believe in </v>
<v Speaker 4>pacifism when you're dealing with thugs </v>

1734
01:23:46.951 --> 01:23:48.490
<v Speaker 4>and evil people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that,</v>

1735
01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:53.380
<v Speaker 4>but I also believe that there's good </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are sent into bad situations</v>

1736
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:58.470
<v Speaker 4>for all the wrong reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by people that are trying to make money </v>

1737
01:23:58.470 --> 01:24:00.340
<v Speaker 4>in that state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that state,</v>

1738
01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:02.530
<v Speaker 4>with being there with all those </v>
<v Speaker 4>soldiers,</v>

1739
01:24:02.710 --> 01:24:04.000
<v Speaker 4>being there with those people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1740
01:24:04.001 --> 01:24:07.810
<v Speaker 4>you got swept away by it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just carried away by this,</v>

1741
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:13.070
<v Speaker 4>this intense feeling of patriotism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's an indescribable because you could </v>

1742
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:17.731
<v Speaker 4>feel the emotions of those people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are in that room and I wonder if that's </v>

1743
01:24:18.491 --> 01:24:22.090
<v Speaker 4>similar to what you were experiencing </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were there.</v>

1744
01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:24.820
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure we're very close and,</v>

1745
01:24:24.821 --> 01:24:27.100
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's not the only time when.</v>

1746
01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:33.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean if the only time I think I felt </v>
<v Speaker 6>that exact sort of emotion of sort of </v>

1747
01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.780
<v Speaker 6>whatever that was as a religious </v>
<v Speaker 6>transcendence,</v>

1748
01:24:34.781 --> 01:24:36.490
<v Speaker 6>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1749
01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 6>there's plenty of times when you are </v>
<v Speaker 6>around people.</v>

1750
01:24:38.951 --> 01:24:40.420
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a way,</v>

1751
01:24:40.421 --> 01:24:45.421
<v Speaker 6>a lot of the stories I do are about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>altered consciousness of being exposed </v>

1752
01:24:45.421 --> 01:24:49.501
<v Speaker 6>to people who believe things </v>
<v Speaker 6>passionately and the slight sense of </v>

1753
01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.900
<v Speaker 6>Stockholm Syndrome that sets in when you</v>
<v Speaker 6>were there for prolonged periods,</v>

1754
01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:53.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1755
01:24:53.651 --> 01:24:54.910
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the weird,</v>

1756
01:24:54.911 --> 01:24:57.150
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>change the,</v>

1757
01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.320
<v Speaker 6>the change in consciousness that takes </v>
<v Speaker 6>place.</v>

1758
01:24:59.560 --> 01:24:59.880
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

1759
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:02.410
<v Speaker 6>I did a story where I was with the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Phelps clan,</v>

1760
01:25:02.411 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 6>the Westboro Baptist Church,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

1761
01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:08.590
<v Speaker 6>I was spent three weeks with them if I </v>
<v Speaker 6>did two different things,</v>

1762
01:25:08.591 --> 01:25:09.690
<v Speaker 6>but for the first one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was there for three,</v>

1763
01:25:09.691 --> 01:25:11.710
<v Speaker 6>which was called the most hated family </v>
<v Speaker 6>in America.</v>

1764
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:15.560
<v Speaker 6>And it was really odd because when </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're inside there,</v>

1765
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:20.850
<v Speaker 6>the little compound in their,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in their castle imbibing they're at and </v>

1766
01:25:20.981 --> 01:25:25.981
<v Speaker 6>their doctrine round the clock,</v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff that seems really weird and </v>

1767
01:25:25.981 --> 01:25:29.920
<v Speaker 6>hateful on the outside starts to seem </v>
<v Speaker 6>mundane.</v>

1768
01:25:30.450 --> 01:25:35.450
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're still able to step outside of </v>

1769
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.450
<v Speaker 6>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm here to do a job and this is wrong,</v>

1770
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 6>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get a nice sized,</v>

1771
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:39.790
<v Speaker 6>your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your mind starts to get influenced.</v>

1772
01:25:39.791 --> 01:25:40.810
<v Speaker 6>It's really strange.</v>

1773
01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.390
<v Speaker 4>I would imagine it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1774
01:25:42.450 --> 01:25:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I've found the Phelps won very </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinating because of the one guy that </v>

1775
01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:51.150
<v Speaker 4>came there to film a documentary on them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then became one of them.</v>

1776
01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:52.500
<v Speaker 6>He joined up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Steve.</v>

1777
01:25:52.530 --> 01:25:54.000
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's very high up there now.</v>

1778
01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.630
<v Speaker 6>Steve.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's and his daughter left,</v>

1779
01:25:58.430 --> 01:26:03.430
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a couple of years ago we went back and </v>

1780
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:05.661
<v Speaker 6>did a followup because a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the people we featured in the first one </v>

1781
01:26:05.661 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 6>then left.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But Steve almost you could argue by dint</v>

1782
01:26:08.871 --> 01:26:13.871
<v Speaker 6>of having been born outside the church </v>
<v Speaker 6>was compensating by being even more </v>

1783
01:26:15.381 --> 01:26:18.290
<v Speaker 6>hardcore because he was the fiercest and</v>
<v Speaker 6>the most,</v>

1784
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:20.240
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in conversation.</v>

1785
01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:23.650
<v Speaker 6>He was the hardest and the most,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1786
01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:27.350
<v Speaker 6>the most abusive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess most verbally</v>

1787
01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.660
<v Speaker 4>full of bile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he also,</v>

1788
01:26:29.661 --> 01:26:32.480
<v Speaker 4>when you questioned anything that he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying,</v>

1789
01:26:32.481 --> 01:26:33.980
<v Speaker 4>what starting salting you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1790
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And aggressively insulting you.</v>

1791
01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:41.291
<v Speaker 4>And I found that fascinating as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't just that you could have </v>

1792
01:26:41.291 --> 01:26:41.291
<v Speaker 4>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1793
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:46.330
<v Speaker 4>what are you fucking idiot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was immediately this aggressive sort </v>

1794
01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:46.330
<v Speaker 4>of</v>

1795
01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:50.610
<v Speaker 6>told me I was the most.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember the phrase that it </v>

1796
01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:53.610
<v Speaker 6>sounds like the most iniquitous or the </v>
<v Speaker 6>most evil man in the history of the </v>

1797
01:26:53.610 --> 01:26:54.970
<v Speaker 6>earth or one of the three most evil men.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

1798
01:26:54.971 --> 01:26:59.971
<v Speaker 6>you're right up there with punches pilot</v>
<v Speaker 6>like I was one of the three most evil </v>

1799
01:26:59.971 --> 01:27:02.110
<v Speaker 6>men of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like way beyond Hitler.</v>

1800
01:27:02.770 --> 01:27:07.770
<v Speaker 6>And the reason was the reason was </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I'd been exposed to the </v>

1801
01:27:08.261 --> 01:27:13.261
<v Speaker 6>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so like I'd been given a special </v>

1802
01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:16.560
<v Speaker 6>opportunity like I was blessed beyond </v>
<v Speaker 6>measure because I had been exposed for </v>

1803
01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:21.301
<v Speaker 6>three weeks to the pure teachings of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>only people preaching salvation on earth</v>

1804
01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:26.290
<v Speaker 6>and having seen that and still rejected </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1805
01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:30.850
<v Speaker 6>then that put me way beyond the Pale.</v>

1806
01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:36.160
<v Speaker 4>I found it incredibly fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How effective of a guy who sucks at </v>

1807
01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.840
<v Speaker 4>speaking is at running a call,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he's a terrible orator.</v>

1808
01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.150
<v Speaker 4>He's not like this really charismatic</v>

1809
01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:44.170
<v Speaker 6>gramps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The main guy.</v>

1810
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:47.650
<v Speaker 6>He's very old now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's in his time.</v>

1811
01:27:47.651 --> 01:27:48.820
<v Speaker 6>He could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He could do it.</v>

1812
01:27:48.821 --> 01:27:53.821
<v Speaker 6>I thought he was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you're being a little unfair </v>

1813
01:27:53.821 --> 01:27:53.821
<v Speaker 6>real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You remember the bit where he says,</v>

1814
01:27:53.821 --> 01:27:54.570
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to eat your babies.</v>

1815
01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:56.260
<v Speaker 6>Like he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he still,</v>

1816
01:27:56.320 --> 01:28:01.320
<v Speaker 6>he's very old and decrepit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he still cranks it up and he goes,</v>

1817
01:28:01.871 --> 01:28:03.730
<v Speaker 6>you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eat your babies.</v>

1818
01:28:04.130 --> 01:28:05.360
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree.</v>

1819
01:28:05.361 --> 01:28:08.420
<v Speaker 4>I felt it was so one note,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like death metal.</v>

1820
01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 4>You can eat your baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1821
01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:15.020
<v Speaker 4>it was just so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just there.</v>

1822
01:28:15.021 --> 01:28:16.540
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who Do you like,</v>

1823
01:28:16.570 --> 01:28:19.640
<v Speaker 4>you like Billy Graham?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what preaching style do you prefer?</v>

1824
01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.620
<v Speaker 4>A Sam Kennison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my favorite.</v>

1825
01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that there are people who </v>

1826
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:30.620
<v Speaker 4>are better at it than Phelps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Phelps is so negative and so abrasive.</v>

1827
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:34.810
<v Speaker 4>I think there's almost his.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so evil.</v>

1828
01:28:35.010 --> 01:28:37.390
<v Speaker 6>Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he starts dearly beloved.</v>

1829
01:28:37.391 --> 01:28:41.450
<v Speaker 6>He has a slow bill and then he ramps it </v>
<v Speaker 6>up and then he get,</v>

1830
01:28:41.470 --> 01:28:44.080
<v Speaker 6>he hits his,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his kind of power chorus.</v>

1831
01:28:44.081 --> 01:28:45.790
<v Speaker 6>If you can eat your babies,</v>

1832
01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:51.160
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something when someone's</v>
<v Speaker 4>unbelievably evil and aggressive where </v>

1833
01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:55.421
<v Speaker 4>you don't want them to be angry at you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're willing to sort of like bend </v>

1834
01:28:56.631 --> 01:29:00.830
<v Speaker 4>your mind to what they're saying and </v>
<v Speaker 4>accept it and allow it in.</v>

1835
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:03.240
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I felt watching that </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

1836
01:29:03.241 --> 01:29:06.390
<v Speaker 4>And I've seen that in him before and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>his speeches,</v>

1837
01:29:06.391 --> 01:29:09.740
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to sort of rationalize or </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand what's going on when,</v>

1838
01:29:09.741 --> 01:29:14.741
<v Speaker 4>when he talks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would anybody gets sucked into all </v>

1839
01:29:14.741 --> 01:29:14.741
<v Speaker 4>this evil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hateful talk and not question it,</v>

1840
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:19.790
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so over the top and so aggressive </v>

1841
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:21.230
<v Speaker 4>that he's frightening to people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you sat down with them.</v>

1842
01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:21.330
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

1843
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:22.390
<v Speaker 6>here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

1844
01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:25.660
<v Speaker 6>I mean by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they don't really make converts.</v>

1845
01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:30.690
<v Speaker 6>They make a few,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he's not trying to recruit new </v>

1846
01:29:30.690 --> 01:29:31.090
<v Speaker 6>personnel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If anything,</v>

1847
01:29:31.091 --> 01:29:32.950
<v Speaker 6>it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They re,</v>

1848
01:29:33.010 --> 01:29:35.110
<v Speaker 6>they view it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1849
01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:40.770
<v Speaker 6>as a confirmation of the holy status of </v>
<v Speaker 6>their salvation that they rejected </v>

1850
01:29:42.101 --> 01:29:44.680
<v Speaker 6>because there's some verse somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the Bible saying,</v>

1851
01:29:44.681 --> 01:29:48.490
<v Speaker 6>you will be hated of men and people will</v>
<v Speaker 6>throw things at you.</v>

1852
01:29:48.491 --> 01:29:51.640
<v Speaker 6>It's somewhere in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so every time someone says,</v>

1853
01:29:51.641 --> 01:29:53.140
<v Speaker 6>you're full of it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're scum.</v>

1854
01:29:53.141 --> 01:29:55.870
<v Speaker 6>We hate you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That what they hear is,</v>

1855
01:29:55.871 --> 01:29:56.770
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we are.</v>

1856
01:29:57.070 --> 01:29:58.810
<v Speaker 6>We're saved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1857
01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:00.370
<v Speaker 6>and so when he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1858
01:30:00.420 --> 01:30:05.420
<v Speaker 6>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like 90 percent of the people in there </v>

1859
01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:05.500
<v Speaker 6>were born into it and a family members.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in fact,</v>

1860
01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.680
<v Speaker 6>they lose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they hemorrhage membership constantly.</v>

1861
01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:11.590
<v Speaker 6>They kicked people out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when he's preaching,</v>

1862
01:30:11.591 --> 01:30:15.730
<v Speaker 6>he's not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how do I get new new followers?</v>

1863
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:17.830
<v Speaker 6>While I'm not saying that he's thinking </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

1864
01:30:17.831 --> 01:30:21.100
<v Speaker 6>I'm wondering the effectiveness of </v>
<v Speaker 6>retaining anyone.</v>

1865
01:30:21.101 --> 01:30:23.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's even there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess there is a,</v>

1866
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:25.900
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the main effectiveness is that,</v>

1867
01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.450
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what it.</v>

1868
01:30:28.570 --> 01:30:33.570
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you would know obviously much more than </v>

1869
01:30:33.570 --> 01:30:35.701
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were there for three weeks deeply </v>

1870
01:30:35.701 --> 01:30:37.240
<v Speaker 6>embedded into that organization.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He hated me.</v>

1871
01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:42.820
<v Speaker 6>GRANDPA did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was one of the few times where </v>

1872
01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:43.870
<v Speaker 6>you try and do an interview with someone</v>
<v Speaker 6>who clearly can't stand you.</v>

1873
01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:46.630
<v Speaker 6>And I did an.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said something like,</v>

1874
01:30:46.800 --> 01:30:49.150
<v Speaker 6>how can you really believe that there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

1875
01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:54.220
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even if you accept that what you say is </v>

1876
01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:54.220
<v Speaker 6>true,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that position is,</v>

1877
01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:57.720
<v Speaker 6>there's no other church in the world </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is preaching the doctrine.</v>

1878
01:30:57.730 --> 01:30:58.900
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how would you even know?</v>

1879
01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:03.910
<v Speaker 6>Like there could be some tiny church in </v>
<v Speaker 6>Nigeria that's preaching the exact same </v>

1880
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:04.680
<v Speaker 6>message.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How would you,</v>

1881
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:07.240
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes and he says,</v>

1882
01:31:07.241 --> 01:31:12.241
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know about them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I asked another question you guys </v>

1883
01:31:12.241 --> 01:31:14.341
<v Speaker 6>asked and answered and I also have </v>
<v Speaker 6>another because asked an answer and he </v>

1884
01:31:14.341 --> 01:31:17.521
<v Speaker 6>just kept saying Austin answered,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a legal term and you know,</v>

1885
01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.610
<v Speaker 6>what do you do what you do then?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well there's nothing you could chuck.</v>

1886
01:31:21.630 --> 01:31:24.070
<v Speaker 6>He's the epitome of a close minded </v>
<v Speaker 6>person.</v>

1887
01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.390
<v Speaker 6>He is</v>

1888
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:27.950
<v Speaker 4>closed minded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not just that,</v>

1889
01:31:27.951 --> 01:31:32.780
<v Speaker 4>but this arrogant assumption that he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>the man with the word of God and that it</v>

1890
01:31:32.781 --> 01:31:35.840
<v Speaker 4>comes out of this angry old fuckheads </v>
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

1891
01:31:36.170 --> 01:31:36.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1892
01:31:36.611 --> 01:31:41.611
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an amazing thing that this guy is </v>

1893
01:31:41.611 --> 01:31:41.870
<v Speaker 4>able to put together this group.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just.</v>

1894
01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:44.780
<v Speaker 4>This is the moment where you sat down </v>
<v Speaker 4>and talked to this guy.</v>

1895
01:31:45.290 --> 01:31:45.620
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1896
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:49.110
<v Speaker 6>How long have you been with him by then?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think this was,</v>

1897
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:50.570
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to think.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was the end of it.</v>

1898
01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:53.580
<v Speaker 6>We made three trips each of a week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was the second trip last day.</v>

1899
01:31:56.430 --> 01:32:00.850
<v Speaker 4>Just a little knowledge of what you just</v>
<v Speaker 4>said is stupidity</v>

1900
01:32:01.150 --> 01:32:06.150
<v Speaker 5>in Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how to deal with questions </v>

1901
01:32:06.150 --> 01:32:06.800
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just you just took dom.</v>

1902
01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.970
<v Speaker 5>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>W you're,</v>

1903
01:32:09.260 --> 01:32:12.090
<v Speaker 5>you've got the duty to know the Bible as</v>
<v Speaker 5>well as I can.</v>

1904
01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:17.280
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you are a human being because </v>

1905
01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.580
<v Speaker 5>God Almighty major and got all my is </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to send you to hell.</v>

1906
01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:24.120
<v Speaker 5>Is it accurate to say that you regard </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Westboro Baptist church is the only </v>

1907
01:32:24.630 --> 01:32:29.630
<v Speaker 5>biblical preaching?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just three minutes of answering your </v>

1908
01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:30.530
<v Speaker 5>question is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1909
01:32:30.550 --> 01:32:32.200
<v Speaker 5>it was five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1910
01:32:32.201 --> 01:32:35.350
<v Speaker 5>but I already talked to them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's three left.</v>

1911
01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 5>He even had a laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Their fucking shitty math preaching that</v>

1912
01:32:40.751 --> 01:32:45.751
<v Speaker 5>is according to the word of God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been asked and answered my next </v>

1913
01:32:45.751 --> 01:32:48.190
<v Speaker 5>question as far as your concerned.</v>

1914
01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:49.430
<v Speaker 6>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1915
01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:54.530
<v Speaker 6>I mean this is angry old shitty man </v>
<v Speaker 6>who's able to get a bunch of people to </v>

1916
01:32:55.711 --> 01:32:57.990
<v Speaker 6>listen to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I finally gets his kids,</v>

1917
01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.780
<v Speaker 6>his kids and his grandkids know how many</v>
<v Speaker 6>people were there.</v>

1918
01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:04.710
<v Speaker 6>It seems like there was 20 or 30 or 90.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's good.</v>

1919
01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:06.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he had 11 year.</v>

1920
01:33:06.690 --> 01:33:09.750
<v Speaker 6>I think I want to get this right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was like 12 kids,</v>

1921
01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:14.670
<v Speaker 6>but for them had left the church and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and each of them had,</v>

1922
01:33:14.671 --> 01:33:18.390
<v Speaker 6>had quite a few kids,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think,</v>

1923
01:33:18.391 --> 01:33:23.391
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think if you're an EGOMANIAC number </v>

1924
01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:23.391
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>number two,</v>

1925
01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:28.191
<v Speaker 6>if whatever reason you cleave to a </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain kind of dogmatic religious </v>

1926
01:33:28.191 --> 01:33:31.360
<v Speaker 6>outlook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's probably not that difficult to,</v>

1927
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:32.370
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to run,</v>

1928
01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:35.190
<v Speaker 6>to have a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's unfortunate,</v>

1929
01:33:35.191 --> 01:33:36.870
<v Speaker 6>but I think you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1930
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:38.490
<v Speaker 1>shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think you're right,</v>

1931
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:43.550
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've often said that all you have to do </v>

1932
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.550
<v Speaker 1>is speak confidently and clearly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>most people will be like,</v>

1933
01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:43.850
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>

1934
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:44.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1935
01:33:44.621 --> 01:33:49.621
<v Speaker 6>and have no compunction about saying </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you speak the word of God or </v>

1936
01:33:49.621 --> 01:33:50.580
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's really all you have to</v>

1937
01:33:50.610 --> 01:33:51.140
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1938
01:33:51.141 --> 01:33:56.141
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the guy with the answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the guy that absolutely </v>

1939
01:33:56.141 --> 01:33:57.140
<v Speaker 1>not just the is like as a human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the answer is from above.</v>

1940
01:33:57.890 --> 01:34:01.280
<v Speaker 6>Have you read the new medicine book than</v>
<v Speaker 6>you Charles Manson Book by Jeff Gwinnett</v>

1941
01:34:01.281 --> 01:34:02.670
<v Speaker 6>came out last year?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1942
01:34:02.690 --> 01:34:05.930
<v Speaker 6>I try not to read anything that comes </v>
<v Speaker 6>out about Manson A.</v>

1943
01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:07.610
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well I'll ask you why in a second,</v>

1944
01:34:07.611 --> 01:34:09.590
<v Speaker 6>but when you read it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

1945
01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:15.520
<v Speaker 6>Oh my word.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just have to be kind of come out </v>

1946
01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:18.071
<v Speaker 6>with a few kind of riddles that you've </v>
<v Speaker 6>learned from St Pimps and people fall </v>

1947
01:34:18.171 --> 01:34:20.300
<v Speaker 6>into your lap or so it would seem.</v>

1948
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:24.280
<v Speaker 1>You made me hate your garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1949
01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:28.270

<v Speaker 1>I'm your product.</v>

1950
01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.840
<v Speaker 1>All that fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that guy's the Bob hope of </v>

1951
01:34:33.971 --> 01:34:35.620
<v Speaker 1>serial killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1952
01:34:35.621 --> 01:34:40.621
<v Speaker 1>because Bob hope was a comedian that </v>
<v Speaker 1>never really made anybody that in my </v>

1953
01:34:40.621 --> 01:34:41.500
<v Speaker 1>generation laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we always knew him as a comedian,</v>

1954
01:34:41.501 --> 01:34:46.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's just really wasn't funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manson's never scary to me.</v>

1955
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some real serial killers </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're fucking terrifying.</v>

1956
01:34:49.690 --> 01:34:54.690
<v Speaker 1>But when you think of serial killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always Manson Manson Manson is the </v>

1957
01:34:54.690 --> 01:34:55.480
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy guy,</v>

1958
01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:58.400
<v Speaker 1>the wild guy because he carved fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>swastika on his head.</v>

1959
01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:01.450
<v Speaker 1>But if you mean Henry Lee Lucas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy from that,</v>

1960
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:06.490
<v Speaker 1>they made that movie about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry Portrait of a serial killer </v>

1961
01:35:06.490 --> 01:35:08.150
<v Speaker 1>allegedly killed somewhere around 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1962
01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:09.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1963
01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1964
01:35:09.730 --> 01:35:11.050
<v Speaker 6>with Manson,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the.</v>

1965
01:35:11.051 --> 01:35:14.170
<v Speaker 6>I think the reason people are fascinated</v>
<v Speaker 6>with medicine is because he didn't kill,</v>

1966
01:35:14.230 --> 01:35:19.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got other people too because he got </v>

1967
01:35:19.230 --> 01:35:19.230
<v Speaker 1>the children that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1968
01:35:19.230 --> 01:35:21.760
<v Speaker 1>he sent them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tex Watson was as big killer,</v>

1969
01:35:21.761 --> 01:35:26.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Become a born again Christian and I </v>

1970
01:35:26.761 --> 01:35:28.780
<v Speaker 1>think he writes children's books or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something fucking creepy</v>

1971
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:29.720
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

1972
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:32.140
<v Speaker 6>a number of them still believe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1973
01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:34.410
<v Speaker 6>that trial is that Charlie's still.</v>

1974
01:35:34.820 --> 01:35:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

1975
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise they're idiots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they're fucked up and you know,</v>

1976
01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:42.320
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what he did,</v>

1977
01:35:42.321 --> 01:35:45.820
<v Speaker 1>what they did do to Sharon tate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tate labianca murders,</v>

1978
01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:50.960
<v Speaker 1>fucking unbelievably horrific and caught</v>
<v Speaker 1>a baby out of her body and a lot all </v>

1979
01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:53.570
<v Speaker 1>over the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was all really,</v>

1980
01:35:53.571 --> 01:35:55.010
<v Speaker 1>really terrifying shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1981
01:35:55.011 --> 01:35:59.150
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's been a series of really,</v>

1982
01:35:59.151 --> 01:36:04.151
<v Speaker 1>really evil people that almost no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows about and it's bizarre what </v>

1983
01:36:04.151 --> 01:36:07.460
<v Speaker 1>becomes popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what becomes famous in the world of evil</v>

1984
01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:10.310
<v Speaker 1>people you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's just a name,</v>

1985
01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manson,</v>

1986
01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:14.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody remembers that name.</v>

1987
01:36:14.230 --> 01:36:19.230
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're too lazy to kind of investigate </v>

1988
01:36:19.230 --> 01:36:19.550
<v Speaker 1>and find out about other names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's been a,</v>

1989
01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:24.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many God damn serial killers in this </v>

1990
01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.131
<v Speaker 1>country or have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre that that one guy gets so </v>

1991
01:36:27.131 --> 01:36:27.140
<v Speaker 1>much ink.</v>

1992
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:33.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well Geraldo can take his share of </v>

1993
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.870
<v Speaker 6>responsibility because for all those </v>
<v Speaker 6>fault.</v>

1994
01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.850
<v Speaker 6>Well he did a number of landmark </v>
<v Speaker 6>interviews in the,</v>

1995
01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:38.920
<v Speaker 6>I guess in the seventies or the early </v>
<v Speaker 6>eighties.</v>

1996
01:36:38.950 --> 01:36:43.120
<v Speaker 6>You can see them on youtube where he </v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of turned him into a celebrity.</v>

1997
01:36:43.121 --> 01:36:43.860
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess the,</v>

1998
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:46.480
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cases were big at the time,</v>

1999
01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:50.470
<v Speaker 6>but then he,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Geraldo did some shows.</v>

2000
01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:55.471
<v Speaker 6>I think Diane Sawyer might've done an </v>
<v Speaker 6>interview and then they passed laws to </v>

2001
01:36:55.471 --> 01:36:59.341
<v Speaker 6>say that you couldn't basically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you couldn't interview Charles Manson </v>

2002
01:36:59.341 --> 01:36:59.341
<v Speaker 6>anymore.</v>

2003
01:36:59.341 --> 01:37:00.530
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to see what Geraldo has</v>
<v Speaker 1>become.</v>

2004
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:05.950
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that Geraldo was like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterculture figure at one time </v>

2005
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Geraldo was the guy who introduced the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world to the Zapruder film.</v>

2006
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:13.390
<v Speaker 1>He had Dick Gregory on his television </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and he showed the world as uproot </v>

2007
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:17.420
<v Speaker 1>or film essentially establishing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that it was more than one person or</v>

2008
01:37:17.421 --> 01:37:20.660
<v Speaker 1>someone else other than Lee Harvey </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oswald that killed Kennedy.</v>

2009
01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Now he's on Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened to Dick Gregory?</v>

2010
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Dick Gregory is still around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>

2011
01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not really a comedian anymore.</v>

2012
01:37:29.541 --> 01:37:34.541
<v Speaker 1>I think he does some shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's more of an activist and he's a </v>

2013
01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:35.240
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very old now.</v>

2014
01:37:35.241 --> 01:37:40.241
<v Speaker 1>But I saw something recently with Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gregory sitting down with Paul Mooney </v>

2015
01:37:40.241 --> 01:37:40.241
<v Speaker 1>who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2016
01:37:40.241 --> 01:37:44.590
<v Speaker 1>a great old comedian from Los Angeles </v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a writer for Richard Pryor and </v>

2017
01:37:44.691 --> 01:37:49.691
<v Speaker 1>just a great comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the two of them were sitting around </v>

2018
01:37:49.691 --> 01:37:50.090
<v Speaker 1>talking about racism and culture.</v>

2019
01:37:51.300 --> 01:37:53.190
<v Speaker 6>Some of his jokes back in the day were </v>
<v Speaker 6>pretty good.</v>

2020
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick Gregory was very good,</v>

2021
01:37:55.650 --> 01:37:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but he was</v>

2022
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:58.410
<v Speaker 4>also not just a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2023
01:37:58.411 --> 01:38:03.411
<v Speaker 4>he was an activist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was the guy who somehow or another </v>

2024
01:38:03.411 --> 01:38:05.961
<v Speaker 4>got ahold of the Zapruder film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The zapruder film was made obviously in </v>

2025
01:38:05.961 --> 01:38:08.850
<v Speaker 4>1963 when Kennedy was assassinated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was put on.</v>

2026
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 4>It was bought by time life magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

2027
01:38:11.940 --> 01:38:15.360
<v Speaker 4>by whoever owns life magazine or time at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>

2028
01:38:15.690 --> 01:38:19.800
<v Speaker 4>And they just put it on shelf for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for years.</v>

2029
01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.370
<v Speaker 4>And 19 seventies is when Geraldo had it </v>
<v Speaker 4>on a show.</v>

2030
01:38:23.670 --> 01:38:27.390
<v Speaker 4>So before that it had never been ed </v>
<v Speaker 4>never.</v>

2031
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:30.990
<v Speaker 4>They just made a TV show about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think about the router family.</v>

2032
01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2033
01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:35.870
<v Speaker 4>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the way they're dressed.</v>

2034
01:38:35.890 --> 01:38:38.410
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Straight out that if you 75.</v>

2035
01:38:38.411 --> 01:38:40.330
<v Speaker 7>So think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eight years later,</v>

2036
01:38:40.390 --> 01:38:44.860
<v Speaker 7>a crazy little queasy then don't watch </v>
<v Speaker 7>this film.</v>

2037
01:38:44.890 --> 01:38:48.160
<v Speaker 7>Just put on the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the late night movie,</v>

2038
01:38:48.270 --> 01:38:51.850
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>because this is a very heavy.</v>

2039
01:38:51.851 --> 01:38:55.150
<v Speaker 7>It's the film shot by the Dallas dress </v>
<v Speaker 7>manufacturer.</v>

2040
01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:00.240
<v Speaker 7>70 five Zapruder and it's the execution </v>
<v Speaker 7>of President Kennedy Way.</v>

2041
01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:06.210
<v Speaker 7>Geraldo has a mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What we're seeing as we show this film </v>

2042
01:39:07.890 --> 01:39:09.450
<v Speaker 7>bruter film.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

2043
01:39:09.451 --> 01:39:12.240
<v Speaker 7>So the cars are coming along now into </v>
<v Speaker 7>dealey plaza.</v>

2044
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:17.390
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are the lead motorcycles in the </v>

2045
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:17.390
<v Speaker 7>motorcade.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All right.</v>

2046
01:39:17.390 --> 01:39:19.530
<v Speaker 7>Now with the president and Mrs Kennedy </v>
<v Speaker 7>is also governor connally right now.</v>

2047
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:24.560
<v Speaker 7>Before he goes behind the sign,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the president is waving to the crowd </v>

2048
01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:24.900
<v Speaker 7>when it comes out from behind the sign,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he is shot.</v>

2049
01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:26.340
<v Speaker 7>Then governor connally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his shot.</v>

2050
01:39:26.430 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 7>He's already been hit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's already been hit.</v>

2051
01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:32.350
<v Speaker 7>And now at the bottom of the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the head shot,</v>

2052
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.290
<v Speaker 7>that's the shot that blew off his head.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the most horrifying thing I've ever</v>

2053
01:39:37.291 --> 01:39:42.291
<v Speaker 7>seen in the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now the Warren Commission said that all </v>

2054
01:39:42.291 --> 01:39:43.020
<v Speaker 7>of the shots were fired from behind by </v>
<v Speaker 7>Lee Harvey Oswald alone,</v>

2055
01:39:43.021 --> 01:39:48.021
<v Speaker 7>assassin firing at the president.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then she could see clearly the head </v>

2056
01:39:48.021 --> 01:39:52.881
<v Speaker 7>is thrown violently backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 7>can completely consistent with the shot </v>

2057
01:39:52.881 --> 01:39:53.100
<v Speaker 7>from the front.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right now,</v>

2058
01:39:53.101 --> 01:39:58.101
<v Speaker 7>this is an extreme blob of just the </v>
<v Speaker 7>president from the film coming out </v>

2059
01:39:58.891 --> 01:40:03.891
<v Speaker 7>behind the sign.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He shot his head from the sit here in </v>

2060
01:40:03.891 --> 01:40:06.290
<v Speaker 7>the front from the front.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Now Jackie doesn't realize what's </v>

2061
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.960
<v Speaker 7>happened yet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>She goes to his aid</v>

2062
01:40:07.690 --> 01:40:08.260
<v Speaker 8>and now</v>

2063
01:40:12.300 --> 01:40:14.430
<v Speaker 7>he's said again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the violent backward motion.</v>

2064
01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:20.000
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen that before with really </v>
<v Speaker 4>never seen this uprooted from a,</v>

2065
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:22.980
<v Speaker 4>just like the bits they showed in jfk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2066
01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:24.580
<v Speaker 4>the Oliver Stone Film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2067
01:40:24.850 --> 01:40:26.490
<v Speaker 4>I'd never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd never seen.</v>

2068
01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:29.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they showed that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2069
01:40:29.520 --> 01:40:30.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2070
01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:32.010
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2071
01:40:32.170 --> 01:40:33.190
<v Speaker 4>it's available.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2072
01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:35.790
<v Speaker 4>they've broken it down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's been enhanced.</v>

2073
01:40:35.791 --> 01:40:38.450
<v Speaker 4>There's a variety that you believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2074
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:39.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were two gunman.</v>

2075
01:40:39.870 --> 01:40:41.220
<v Speaker 4>I think there was probably more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>two.</v>

2076
01:40:41.230 --> 01:40:42.300
<v Speaker 4>Garmin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2077
01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.190
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think.</v>

2078
01:40:44.230 --> 01:40:47.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's an either or was one </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the Woody Harrelson's dad.</v>

2079
01:40:47.150 --> 01:40:48.780
<v Speaker 4>It very well could have been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2080
01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that fascinating?</v>

2081
01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.240
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it was an either or </v>

2082
01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:55.240
<v Speaker 4>because everybody wants to say that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was either</v>

2083
01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:57.640
<v Speaker 1>Lee Harvey Oswald or it was other </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2084
01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:00.550
<v Speaker 1>It could have been Lee Harvey Oswald and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people,</v>

2085
01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:05.580
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand why people have to </v>

2086
01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:07.831
<v Speaker 1>have everything black and white and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's Lee Harvey Oswald acted </v>

2087
01:41:07.831 --> 01:41:07.831
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2088
01:41:07.831 --> 01:41:08.670
<v Speaker 1>why do you think that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think that?</v>

2089
01:41:08.671 --> 01:41:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Like why would anybody think that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>acted alone?</v>

2090
01:41:10.721 --> 01:41:13.870
<v Speaker 1>If you look at all the injuries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy was Bonnie,</v>

2091
01:41:13.930 --> 01:41:15.520
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shot in the neck.</v>

2092
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:18.280
<v Speaker 1>It's an entry wound in Bethesda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maryland.</v>

2093
01:41:18.640 --> 01:41:21.490
<v Speaker 1>They called it a tracheotomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Dallas,</v>

2094
01:41:21.491 --> 01:41:26.491
<v Speaker 1>fort worth when he was first </v>
<v Speaker 1>administered by taking care of my </v>

2095
01:41:26.491 --> 01:41:26.710
<v Speaker 1>doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said it was an entry wound.</v>

2096
01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:32.100
<v Speaker 1>They changed what the wound in his neck </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in order to fit with the established</v>

2097
01:41:32.200 --> 01:41:35.110
<v Speaker 1>narrative of Lee Harvey Oswald being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lone shooter.</v>

2098
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.410
<v Speaker 1>That's one reason to think that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was more than one person.</v>

2099
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:43.830
<v Speaker 1>The other reason to think there was more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than one person was the single bullet </v>

2100
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:46.261
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard a lot of people say that </v>

2101
01:41:46.261 --> 01:41:46.261
<v Speaker 1>the single bullet theory could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

2102
01:41:46.261 --> 01:41:50.490
<v Speaker 1>That bullets can act very weird when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they go through and they absolutely </v>

2103
01:41:50.490 --> 01:41:53.560
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have shot people and bullets shot</v>

2104
01:41:53.561 --> 01:41:58.561
<v Speaker 1>someone from the front and the bullet </v>
<v Speaker 1>has ricocheted inside their head and </v>

2105
01:41:58.561 --> 01:41:58.930
<v Speaker 1>come out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and landed in front.</v>

2106
01:41:58.990 --> 01:42:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean that has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's take very strange past when </v>

2107
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:05.830
<v Speaker 1>they ricochet off bones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what's weird about the bullet</v>

2108
01:42:05.831 --> 01:42:10.831
<v Speaker 1>passing through to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's weird about the bullet passing </v>

2109
01:42:10.831 --> 01:42:13.891
<v Speaker 1>through to people is first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did they think that one bullet did </v>

2110
01:42:13.891 --> 01:42:15.730
<v Speaker 1>that and the reason for that is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bullet hit,</v>

2111
01:42:15.731 --> 01:42:20.731
<v Speaker 1>the underpass ricocheted off a curb </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone and hurt some person that was </v>

2112
01:42:20.731 --> 01:42:24.931
<v Speaker 1>standing in the underpass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had to attribute one of the </v>

2113
01:42:24.931 --> 01:42:25.090
<v Speaker 1>shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the three shots to that bullet,</v>

2114
01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:30.420
<v Speaker 1>they knew that Kennedy and connally had </v>
<v Speaker 1>both been hit and then they knew that </v>

2115
01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:31.420
<v Speaker 1>there was a headshot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those are three bullets,</v>

2116
01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:36.540
<v Speaker 1>one boat that hit the curb stone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other boat that passed through two </v>

2117
01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:36.540
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the headshot.</v>

2118
01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:40.470
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why they had to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entry wound of the neck a </v>

2119
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:44.071
<v Speaker 1>tracheotomy and that's the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to say that one bullet had </v>

2120
01:42:44.071 --> 01:42:45.250
<v Speaker 1>caused these wounds on two different </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2121
01:42:45.490 --> 01:42:49.120
<v Speaker 1>They found the bullet on the Gurney in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Connolly's hospital,</v>

2122
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Gurney when he was administered in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital.</v>

2123
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we found a bullet in pristine condition </v>

2124
01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.800
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever shot a bullet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that bullets hit bone.</v>

2125
01:42:57.070 --> 01:43:02.070
<v Speaker 1>When bullets hit bone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they distort the idea that that bullet </v>

2126
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:05.701
<v Speaker 1>came out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After going through two people's bodies </v>

2127
01:43:05.701 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 1>and hitting bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2128
01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:11.460
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the reason why I think that more </v>

2129
01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:14.521
<v Speaker 1>than one person was involved and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why there's a book called </v>

2130
01:43:14.521 --> 01:43:17.410
<v Speaker 1>best evidence by a guy named David </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lifton who goes into great detail.</v>

2131
01:43:17.411 --> 01:43:22.411
<v Speaker 1>He was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a bookkeeper and an accountant </v>

2132
01:43:22.411 --> 01:43:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2133
01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:27.650
<v Speaker 1>he had some assignment revolving </v>
<v Speaker 1>involving the Warren Commission and he </v>

2134
01:43:27.650 --> 01:43:32.371
<v Speaker 1>was such a meticulous guy that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually read the entire Warren </v>

2135
01:43:32.371 --> 01:43:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is some insane number of pages,</v>

2136
01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:39.180
<v Speaker 1>but he read it and he wrote a book </v>
<v Speaker 1>called best evidence all about all the </v>

2137
01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:43.111
<v Speaker 1>contradictions in the Warren Commission </v>
<v Speaker 1>report and why he thought that the </v>

2138
01:43:43.111 --> 01:43:45.530
<v Speaker 1>entire thing was established to make a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

2139
01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.690
<v Speaker 1>a predetermined conclusion and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>establish that with the American public.</v>

2140
01:43:49.690 --> 01:43:52.970
<v Speaker 1>And he thought it was all horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think so.</v>

2141
01:43:53.210 --> 01:43:54.770
<v Speaker 1>I think more than one person was </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved,</v>

2142
01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but it could have been Lee Harvey Oswald</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2143
01:43:57.140 --> 01:44:02.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what people don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why people have to have either Lee </v>

2144
01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Oswald killed them or there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people like it has to be there </v>

2145
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.430
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assassin or other people.</v>

2146
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:10.811
<v Speaker 1>I think the Harvey Oswald clearly was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up guy who had some sort of a </v>

2147
01:44:10.881 --> 01:44:13.510
<v Speaker 1>connection to the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went to Russia,</v>

2148
01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:16.880
<v Speaker 1>lived in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then came back to the United States,</v>

2149
01:44:16.881 --> 01:44:21.500
<v Speaker 1>got a passport until he was living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and then was readmitted back into</v>

2150
01:44:21.501 --> 01:44:24.440
<v Speaker 1>the United States and had some dubious </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections to the,</v>

2151
01:44:24.441 --> 01:44:25.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2152
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.070
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world of,</v>

2153
01:44:27.071 --> 01:44:27.980
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of government.</v>

2154
01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:32.360
<v Speaker 1>It was a very strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange story that in this day and age,</v>

2155
01:44:32.361 --> 01:44:33.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these years later,</v>

2156
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:36.340
<v Speaker 1>we're most likely never going to get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>full.</v>

2157
01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 6>How many impacts do you see in that </v>
<v Speaker 6>video?</v>

2158
01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:40.140
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2159
01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:43.490
<v Speaker 1>when Kennedy is holding his body like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2160
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:45.830
<v Speaker 1>most likely he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had been hit,</v>

2161
01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.570
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying that it was from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>

2162
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:50.000
<v Speaker 1>How do you know it was from the front?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was from the,</v>

2163
01:44:50.010 --> 01:44:52.130
<v Speaker 1>behind the sign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could've been hit from the back.</v>

2164
01:44:52.131 --> 01:44:53.560
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me,</v>

2165
01:44:53.630 --> 01:44:58.630
<v Speaker 1>he's going like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're assuming that that's because he </v>

2166
01:44:58.630 --> 01:44:58.630
<v Speaker 1>was hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it might not have been.</v>

2167
01:44:58.630 --> 01:45:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might've dropped his fucking pen.</v>

2168
01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might've been like,</v>

2169
01:45:01.581 --> 01:45:03.560
<v Speaker 1>where's my shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then got hit in the head.</v>

2170
01:45:03.561 --> 01:45:05.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2171
01:45:05.240 --> 01:45:09.500
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to tell from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>video how many times he's been hit,</v>

2172
01:45:10.190 --> 01:45:15.190
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald </v>
<v Speaker 1>acted alone seems the least likely of </v>

2173
01:45:16.401 --> 01:45:21.401
<v Speaker 1>those of the scenarios,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the photos of the Howard hunt </v>

2174
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:26.590
<v Speaker 1>who was arrested allegedly along with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people that were quote Unquote </v>

2175
01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:32.740
<v Speaker 1>Hobos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they ended up arrested behind the </v>

2176
01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:33.410
<v Speaker 1>behind the grassy knoll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then they were all released.</v>

2177
01:45:33.650 --> 01:45:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Their hobos were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were dressed normal,</v>

2178
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:36.050
<v Speaker 1>their address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2179
01:45:36.090 --> 01:45:37.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular people.</v>

2180
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:38.950
<v Speaker 1>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woody Harrelson,</v>

2181
01:45:38.951 --> 01:45:43.951
<v Speaker 1>his dad who was a known murderer who </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly has some sort of a connection</v>

2182
01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:45.990
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2183
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2184
01:45:46.911 --> 01:45:51.911
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy who wanted to get rid of </v>

2185
01:45:51.911 --> 01:45:51.911
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who wanted to get rid of</v>

2186
01:45:51.911 --> 01:45:54.230
<v Speaker 1>the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to pull out of Vietnam.</v>

2187
01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit that Kennedy </v>

2188
01:45:59.290 --> 01:45:59.290
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to put us.</v>

2189
01:45:59.290 --> 01:46:03.190
<v Speaker 1>He put us out of Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to disrupt the military </v>

2190
01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:07.301
<v Speaker 1>industrial complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to do a lot of things that </v>

2191
01:46:07.301 --> 01:46:07.301
<v Speaker 1>were very unpopular.</v>

2192
01:46:07.650 --> 01:46:12.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in a way you could pose the question is </v>

2193
01:46:12.650 --> 01:46:14.900
<v Speaker 6>not why would he have been assassinated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but why aren't more president's </v>

2194
01:46:14.900 --> 01:46:15.670
<v Speaker 6>assassinated?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll look at a guy like Obama who,</v>

2195
01:46:15.690 --> 01:46:20.690
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing to me that given the level </v>
<v Speaker 6>of vitriol that's directed at him from </v>

2196
01:46:21.271 --> 01:46:22.190
<v Speaker 6>quarters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2197
01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:27.200
<v Speaker 6>in the far right that someone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think every day there are threats </v>

2198
01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:29.970
<v Speaker 6>and probably some of them are credible </v>
<v Speaker 6>threats against him.</v>

2199
01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:30.810
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

2200
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:36.070
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that CIA or the rather the </v>
<v Speaker 1>secret service does a great job of </v>

2201
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.800
<v Speaker 1>stopping a lot of assassination </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts.</v>

2202
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:38.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we lived in a time like,</v>

2203
01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:40.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Lincoln administration,</v>

2204
01:46:40.611 --> 01:46:42.560
<v Speaker 1>whether there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was very just,</v>

2205
01:46:42.561 --> 01:46:47.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just didn't have the type of </v>

2206
01:46:47.561 --> 01:46:48.821
<v Speaker 1>security that they have today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have this sort of </v>

2207
01:46:48.821 --> 01:46:48.821
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to track people,</v>

2208
01:46:48.821 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 1>the ability to keep an eye on </v>
<v Speaker 1>questionable</v>

2209
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:50.790
<v Speaker 4>folks</v>

2210
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:51.440
<v Speaker 6>did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2211
01:46:51.500 --> 01:46:55.790
<v Speaker 6>did you follow one of the guys they </v>
<v Speaker 6>questioned in connection with threats to</v>

2212
01:46:55.791 --> 01:46:59.420
<v Speaker 6>the president was Ted Nugent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>did you know that question with?</v>

2213
01:46:59.690 --> 01:47:02.660
<v Speaker 6>He was actually for statements that he'd</v>
<v Speaker 6>made about Obama.</v>

2214
01:47:02.661 --> 01:47:05.690
<v Speaker 6>He got a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he got a visit from the secret service.</v>

2215
01:47:05.770 --> 01:47:10.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said that he would wind up in jail </v>

2216
01:47:10.770 --> 01:47:10.840
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if Obama was elected again,</v>

2217
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:12.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he would wind up in jail.</v>

2218
01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:17.200
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that was construed as a threat to </v>

2219
01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:17.710
<v Speaker 6>them because I made a program about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's another guy.</v>

2220
01:47:17.770 --> 01:47:21.670
<v Speaker 6>I did it when I started out working in </v>
<v Speaker 6>TV with Michael Moore.</v>

2221
01:47:22.370 --> 01:47:27.370
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he gave me my break on tv and I worked </v>

2222
01:47:27.370 --> 01:47:29.830
<v Speaker 6>on a show called TV nation and one of </v>
<v Speaker 6>the early segments was with Ted nugent.</v>

2223
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:32.440
<v Speaker 6>I've always had a sort of fascination </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the far right.</v>

2224
01:47:32.530 --> 01:47:34.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a very fascinating guy.</v>

2225
01:47:34.271 --> 01:47:39.271
<v Speaker 4>And the FARC row on the far right </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there's been so much bizarre </v>

2226
01:47:39.271 --> 01:47:43.321
<v Speaker 4>shit in his past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had adopted some 17 year old girl or </v>

2227
01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:50.100
<v Speaker 4>became a legal custody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Took legal custody of her so we could </v>

2228
01:47:50.100 --> 01:47:52.891
<v Speaker 4>have sex with her.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that rights as parents allowed it or </v>

2229
01:47:52.891 --> 01:47:52.891
<v Speaker 4>her parents maybe or 11?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2230
01:47:52.891 --> 01:47:56.130
<v Speaker 6>It said in a recent New York Times story</v>
<v Speaker 6>that he had admitted to having,</v>

2231
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:58.980
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess unlawful,</v>

2232
01:47:58.981 --> 01:48:02.650
<v Speaker 6>a relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sexual relations with underage girls.</v>

2233
01:48:02.790 --> 01:48:03.570
<v Speaker 6>Underage girl.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2234
01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:05.000
<v Speaker 4>Goals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does that ring a bell?</v>

2235
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:08.140
<v Speaker 4>There was something that Courtney love </v>
<v Speaker 4>said that she gave him a blowjob and she</v>

2236
01:48:08.141 --> 01:48:10.090
<v Speaker 4>was 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really am.</v>

2237
01:48:10.170 --> 01:48:12.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently allegedly A.</v>

2238
01:48:13.050 --> 01:48:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fascinating character.</v>

2239
01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:17.710
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a radical far right,</v>

2240
01:48:17.740 --> 01:48:22.740
<v Speaker 4>sort of a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what he said about Obama was clearly</v>

2241
01:48:22.751 --> 01:48:25.690
<v Speaker 4>a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't have jokes about Obama.</v>

2242
01:48:25.691 --> 01:48:27.450
<v Speaker 4>Like we had a guy on</v>

2243
01:48:27.700 --> 01:48:31.990
<v Speaker 6>that was a joke as much as just A.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a racist,</v>

2244
01:48:31.991 --> 01:48:34.000
<v Speaker 6>insult,</v>
<v Speaker 6>racist.</v>

2245
01:48:34.210 --> 01:48:35.170
<v Speaker 6>When he said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2246
01:48:35.171 --> 01:48:40.171
<v Speaker 6>this was a different occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This was when he called him a subhuman </v>

2247
01:48:40.171 --> 01:48:40.171
<v Speaker 6>Mongrel.</v>

2248
01:48:40.171 --> 01:48:40.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2249
01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:45.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well that's not what we're talking </v>

2250
01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:45.680
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that was the reason why he</v>

2251
01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:46.580
<v Speaker 4>got up with the visit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2252
01:48:46.581 --> 01:48:48.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I switched the subject.</v>

2253
01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:52.020
<v Speaker 4>It was more recently in the news because</v>
<v Speaker 4>of this comment.</v>

2254
01:48:52.110 --> 01:48:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The visit was before the reelection </v>

2255
01:48:57.110 --> 01:48:57.130
<v Speaker 4>instead of Obama got in office again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would wind up being arrested.</v>

2256
01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:02.320
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that was a CIA visited him and </v>

2257
01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:02.330
<v Speaker 4>I think he was just talking shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2258
01:49:02.331 --> 01:49:05.430
<v Speaker 4>I think he just talks a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does an incredible amount of media.</v>

2259
01:49:05.431 --> 01:49:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty fascinated by that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2260
01:49:08.730 --> 01:49:09.480
<v Speaker 4>when I was with him,</v>

2261
01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:13.820
<v Speaker 6>she said that I said something about the</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oklahoma City bombing.</v>

2262
01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:17.540
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why is your flag at half mast?</v>

2263
01:49:17.541 --> 01:49:19.190
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because of the Oklahoma City bombing.</v>

2264
01:49:19.850 --> 01:49:21.230
<v Speaker 6>It was at the time when I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2265
01:49:21.530 --> 01:49:26.530
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it had just come out that Terry Nichols </v>

2266
01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:26.530
<v Speaker 6>had,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had some relationship with,</v>

2267
01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:28.120
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2268
01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.410
<v Speaker 6>the Timothy Mcveigh.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

2269
01:49:30.411 --> 01:49:31.160
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2270
01:49:31.161 --> 01:49:36.161
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it seems as though the suspects that </v>

2271
01:49:36.161 --> 01:49:38.231
<v Speaker 6>they have in custody,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was pretrial have the same sort of </v>

2272
01:49:38.231 --> 01:49:38.231
<v Speaker 6>profile as you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ted,</v>

2273
01:49:38.231 --> 01:49:38.240
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're,</v>

2274
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:43.250
<v Speaker 6>they're pro gun rights members of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Michigan militia who you say you </v>

2275
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:44.840
<v Speaker 6>support.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Which was kind of a cheeky question.</v>

2276
01:49:44.900 --> 01:49:45.570
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2277
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:47.930
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I was asking you</v>

2278
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:49.810
<v Speaker 4>now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd asked it in a different way,</v>

2279
01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:52.680
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he kind of went nuts and,</v>

2280
01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:56.920
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and started shouting abuse at me.</v>

2281
01:49:57.660 --> 01:49:58.900
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2282
01:49:59.150 --> 01:50:00.370
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he became logarithmic.</v>

2283
01:50:00.490 --> 01:50:02.860
<v Speaker 4>Like he became incapable as he was so </v>
<v Speaker 4>angry.</v>

2284
01:50:03.310 --> 01:50:06.270
<v Speaker 4>He didn't hit me or he just read it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that this is what,</v>

2285
01:50:06.330 --> 01:50:11.330
<v Speaker 4>this is what the media does and why did </v>
<v Speaker 4>I mention you could kiss my ass.</v>

2286
01:50:12.130 --> 01:50:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Like he said something like Ted nugent </v>
<v Speaker 4>impression by the way you even touch </v>

2287
01:50:17.130 --> 01:50:17.130
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>took the tone row,</v>

2288
01:50:17.130 --> 01:50:17.620
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he said,</v>

2289
01:50:17.621 --> 01:50:18.670
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2290
01:50:18.671 --> 01:50:19.990
<v Speaker 4>what do you think about Janet Reno?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2291
01:50:19.991 --> 01:50:22.930
<v Speaker 4>she's worse than Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

2292
01:50:23.890 --> 01:50:27.460
<v Speaker 4>worse than Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like even if you hate Janet Reno,</v>

2293
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:31.510
<v Speaker 4>she's not rounding people up and sending</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to their death in,</v>

2294
01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:31.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2295
01:50:31.860 --> 01:50:34.210
<v Speaker 4>in the millions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2296
01:50:34.270 --> 01:50:39.270
<v Speaker 4>and then he had a mony said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well no one's worse than Hitler I </v>

2297
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:39.270
<v Speaker 4>suppose.</v>

2298
01:50:39.270 --> 01:50:43.560
<v Speaker 4>And he kinda climbed down from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a thing that he does </v>

2299
01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:46.801
<v Speaker 4>where he just talks a lot and I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you talk a lot you just need to </v>

2300
01:50:46.801 --> 01:50:47.620
<v Speaker 4>keep talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's also very,</v>

2301
01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:52.000
<v Speaker 4>he talks a lot and he's very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just very keyed up sometimes,</v>

2302
01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:53.830
<v Speaker 4>but he's watching them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lighting guy,</v>

2303
01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.930
<v Speaker 4>like he's actually quite and he can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>quite.</v>

2304
01:50:55.931 --> 01:50:59.050
<v Speaker 4>I went on a little hunting excursion </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them as part of the show as well.</v>

2305
01:50:59.530 --> 01:51:01.450
<v Speaker 4>And he's capable of being kind of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mellow,</v>

2306
01:51:01.451 --> 01:51:03.310
<v Speaker 4>interesting dude as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2307
01:51:03.311 --> 01:51:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I was going to say.</v>

2308
01:51:04.931 --> 01:51:06.190
<v Speaker 4>Like you watch them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was hunting show.</v>

2309
01:51:06.191 --> 01:51:09.790
<v Speaker 4>He seems very happy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I hunt and I've watched his hunting</v>

2310
01:51:09.791 --> 01:51:14.791
<v Speaker 4>show many times and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his hunting in quotes is very odd too.</v>

2311
01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:18.820
<v Speaker 4>And this leads us to another subject </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I wanted to cover with you.</v>

2312
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:20.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2313
01:51:20.530 --> 01:51:23.140
<v Speaker 4>he hunts in his yard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2314
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:28.200
<v Speaker 4>He's got a compound of 300 acres and in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Texas and he's got one in Michigan as </v>

2315
01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:33.140
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

2316
01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.910
<v Speaker 4>he leaves out food and weight and a tree</v>
<v Speaker 4>and shoots these animals.</v>

2317
01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:38.520
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a.</v>

2318
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:43.830
<v Speaker 4>So it would be caught,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be considered canned hunting </v>

2319
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.830
<v Speaker 4>there 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2320
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:46.780
<v Speaker 4>But he's using a bow and Arrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which to me,</v>

2321
01:51:46.781 --> 01:51:51.781
<v Speaker 4>mate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got more time for bow and Arrow </v>

2322
01:51:51.781 --> 01:51:54.451
<v Speaker 4>hunters in the sense that it's so much </v>
<v Speaker 4>more difficult unless you're leaving </v>

2323
01:51:54.451 --> 01:51:58.771
<v Speaker 4>food out and the animals are eating food</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 feet away from you and you're hiding </v>

2324
01:51:58.771 --> 01:51:59.770
<v Speaker 4>in a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that helps.</v>

2325
01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:05.040
<v Speaker 4>It helps a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very controversial method of </v>

2326
01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:06.400
<v Speaker 4>hunting and there's two types of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in.</v>

2327
01:52:06.401 --> 01:52:11.401
<v Speaker 4>When it comes to the hunting community,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's people that are fair chase </v>

2328
01:52:11.401 --> 01:52:13.030
<v Speaker 4>hunters and people that believe in high </v>
<v Speaker 4>fence operations and sometimes they're,</v>

2329
01:52:13.060 --> 01:52:14.050
<v Speaker 4>they're interchangeable.</v>

2330
01:52:14.050 --> 01:52:16.650
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes people support both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2331
01:52:17.110 --> 01:52:18.860
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>

2332
01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:24.090
<v Speaker 4>This is the way I feel about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's a great way of </v>

2333
01:52:24.090 --> 01:52:26.881
<v Speaker 4>acquiring meet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably way more ethical than </v>

2334
01:52:26.881 --> 01:52:26.881
<v Speaker 4>being a farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2335
01:52:26.881 --> 01:52:27.070
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to say,</v>

2336
01:52:27.071 --> 01:52:28.570
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is how I acquire my meat.</v>

2337
01:52:28.571 --> 01:52:30.280
<v Speaker 4>I leave food out for them and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoot them.</v>

2338
01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:34.010
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see that and I agree with that.</v>

2339
01:52:34.011 --> 01:52:36.820
<v Speaker 4>It think it's better than farming in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that sense,</v>

2340
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:40.900
<v Speaker 4>but it's to call it hunting the same way</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would call hunting,</v>

2341
01:52:40.901 --> 01:52:45.901
<v Speaker 4>like climbing up to the Alps and looking</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a mountain goat that lives in the </v>

2342
01:52:45.901 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 4>wild or</v>

2343
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:51.250
<v Speaker 1>going through the rockies and chasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>down a moose,</v>

2344
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:53.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lives in the wild.</v>

2345
01:52:53.370 --> 01:52:56.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a two completely different sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavors.</v>

2346
01:52:57.170 --> 01:53:02.170
<v Speaker 1>When you've got these animals fenced in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an account of how many are </v>

2347
01:53:02.170 --> 01:53:02.210
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 300 a year.</v>

2348
01:53:02.480 --> 01:53:04.160
<v Speaker 1>I need to kill one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2349
01:53:04.161 --> 01:53:08.570
<v Speaker 1>and that's not really hunting and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shows,</v>

2350
01:53:08.571 --> 01:53:13.571
<v Speaker 1>which I found very fascinating that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>watched last night was about canned </v>

2351
01:53:13.571 --> 01:53:14.230
<v Speaker 1>hunts and Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2352
01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:19.660
<v Speaker 1>And that was really fascinating what a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contradictory and complex subject </v>

2353
01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:26.920
<v Speaker 1>because for folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa was on the verge of a lot of the </v>

2354
01:53:27.921 --> 01:53:31.910
<v Speaker 1>animals that are now being hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on the verge of extinction now.</v>

2355
01:53:31.911 --> 01:53:36.911
<v Speaker 1>They have extremely high numbers all in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these high fence operations and these </v>

2356
01:53:37.281 --> 01:53:42.200
<v Speaker 1>people go over there and hunt them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that guy that you had that own,</v>

2357
01:53:42.201 --> 01:53:47.201
<v Speaker 1>that operation that got crazy with you </v>
<v Speaker 1>and put his hand on the camera and hold </v>

2358
01:53:47.201 --> 01:53:48.640
<v Speaker 1>it down was very emotional.</v>

2359
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:53.910
<v Speaker 6>Where was the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was making the exact same point you </v>

2360
01:53:53.910 --> 01:53:54.560
<v Speaker 6>just made and I think the phrase I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2361
01:53:54.810 --> 01:53:59.810
<v Speaker 6>if you've got a fence up and the animal </v>
<v Speaker 6>knows it's going to be fed and you just </v>

2362
01:53:59.851 --> 01:54:04.851
<v Speaker 6>hide in your little a bunker until you </v>
<v Speaker 6>know the wart hog or the lion shows up </v>

2363
01:54:05.011 --> 01:54:07.620
<v Speaker 6>knowing that the foods out and then you </v>
<v Speaker 6>take a puppet.</v>

2364
01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:10.350
<v Speaker 6>I said it's like it's like tennis </v>
<v Speaker 6>without a net.</v>

2365
01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:12.930
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was what he took exception to.</v>

2366
01:54:13.310 --> 01:54:15.740
<v Speaker 6>You said it's very artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Something very.</v>

2367
01:54:15.741 --> 01:54:16.920
<v Speaker 6>Any.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He agreed to it.</v>

2368
01:54:16.921 --> 01:54:18.990
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But then what was fascinating to me,</v>

2369
01:54:19.170 --> 01:54:19.910
<v Speaker 6>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>had,</v>

2370
01:54:19.970 --> 01:54:22.170
<v Speaker 6>don't understand Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Africa's fucked.</v>

2371
01:54:22.210 --> 01:54:23.750
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Africa is fucked.</v>

2372
01:54:24.910 --> 01:54:28.440
<v Speaker 6>I hate fucking elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't eat the shitty push.</v>

2373
01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:30.320
<v Speaker 6>They always eat the tall trees.</v>

2374
01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:37.340
<v Speaker 6>And he goes on a rant about Africa is </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucked because we eat everything and we </v>

2375
01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:40.020
<v Speaker 6>kill everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he sort of A.</v>

2376
01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:41.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a great moment because he,</v>

2377
01:54:41.550 --> 01:54:43.500
<v Speaker 6>he in,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the act of asking,</v>

2378
01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:45.730
<v Speaker 6>I don't think the question was that </v>
<v Speaker 6>cheeky was,</v>

2379
01:54:45.731 --> 01:54:50.160
<v Speaker 6>it was a fair question if he'd said </v>
<v Speaker 6>similar things to me about,</v>

2380
01:54:50.161 --> 01:54:50.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not,</v>

2381
01:54:50.610 --> 01:54:52.380
<v Speaker 6>is it real hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not Hunting,</v>

2382
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:54.570
<v Speaker 6>but some people don't want a big flash </v>
<v Speaker 6>cards.</v>

2383
01:54:54.571 --> 01:54:56.380
<v Speaker 6>They wanted little shitty car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2384
01:54:56.381 --> 01:54:58.590
<v Speaker 6>that was his analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

2385
01:54:58.591 --> 01:55:00.240
<v Speaker 6>so when I say tends without net,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he would agree.</v>

2386
01:55:00.270 --> 01:55:02.820
<v Speaker 6>But he was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was kind of a little tweet.</v>

2387
01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:05.130
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think his point though,</v>

2388
01:55:05.131 --> 01:55:10.131
<v Speaker 6>and his point was well taken and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>set him up to go to deliver a very </v>

2389
01:55:10.131 --> 01:55:12.480
<v Speaker 6>impassioned monologue on many of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>problems that are very real.</v>

2390
01:55:12.481 --> 01:55:13.260
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in Africa.</v>

2391
01:55:13.410 --> 01:55:14.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most certainly.</v>

2392
01:55:14.740 --> 01:55:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I also found it incredibly fascinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you guys were feeding the lions </v>

2393
01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:25.290
<v Speaker 1>because I saw both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're on one side I saw like this is </v>

2394
01:55:25.290 --> 01:55:30.181
<v Speaker 1>so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this in enclosed fenced in small</v>

2395
01:55:30.221 --> 01:55:35.221
<v Speaker 1>area where these lines are being bred </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're hurling these calves,</v>

2396
01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:40.560
<v Speaker 1>these dead calves over the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fence and these lions are eating these </v>

2397
01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:45.211
<v Speaker 1>calves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you were talking about how clean </v>

2398
01:55:45.211 --> 01:55:45.211
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2399
01:55:45.211 --> 01:55:45.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't fight,</v>

2400
01:55:45.450 --> 01:55:46.920
<v Speaker 1>they have food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is right here.</v>

2401
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:48.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing he,</v>

2402
01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:52.620
<v Speaker 1>where he was saying it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think these things are your friend.</v>

2403
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I put you over there,</v>

2404
01:55:54.691 --> 01:55:56.340
<v Speaker 1>if you went through they would tear you </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

2405
01:55:56.341 --> 01:55:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Like instantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like play with your clouds.</v>

2406
01:55:59.950 --> 01:56:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And play with your clothes.</v>

2407
01:56:01.411 --> 01:56:06.411
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking dark reminders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The top part of your skull and the </v>

2408
01:56:06.411 --> 01:56:10.720
<v Speaker 1>roots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will eat everything and they will </v>

2409
01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.280
<v Speaker 1>play with your clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2410
01:56:12.540 --> 01:56:14.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so fucked up</v>

2411
01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:16.850
<v Speaker 6>because it's so true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you're close to them,</v>

2412
01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:22.120
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just to get close to that fence like I </v>

2413
01:56:22.120 --> 01:56:22.220
<v Speaker 6>probably 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 feet away.</v>

2414
01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.090
<v Speaker 6>But just to get it was something in you </v>
<v Speaker 6>that almost prevents you.</v>

2415
01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:26.690
<v Speaker 6>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2416
01:56:26.691 --> 01:56:27.980
<v Speaker 6>you're safe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a fence.</v>

2417
01:56:27.981 --> 01:56:31.010
<v Speaker 6>He's not going to not defensive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you just physically,</v>

2418
01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:36.580
<v Speaker 6>there's something really embedded in the</v>
<v Speaker 6>psyche that tells you don't get any </v>

2419
01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:37.490
<v Speaker 6>closer like lines when you're up close </v>
<v Speaker 6>with them.</v>

2420
01:56:37.491 --> 01:56:40.420
<v Speaker 6>Then put that video back again a little </v>
<v Speaker 6>bit earlier.</v>

2421
01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:41.780
<v Speaker 1>When you see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2422
01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:43.440
<v Speaker 1>when you throw in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2423
01:56:43.710 --> 01:56:48.210
<v Speaker 1>the cabs over the fence and you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the looks in their eyes when they're</v>

2424
01:56:48.211 --> 01:56:51.630
<v Speaker 1>staring at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking so terrifying.</v>

2425
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:54.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't need to put the volume on it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just to show the,</v>

2426
01:56:54.051 --> 01:56:54.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the images of it.</v>

2427
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:59.520
<v Speaker 1>It's so terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That such an unbelievable.</v>

2428
01:56:59.521 --> 01:57:04.521
<v Speaker 1>And it's very different than the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The zoo is a different experience and I </v>

2429
01:57:04.521 --> 01:57:07.950
<v Speaker 1>don't know if it's because the animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>get that food slid to them underneath.</v>

2430
01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a plate of food.</v>

2431
01:57:09.331 --> 01:57:12.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not an actual animal that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>tearing apart.</v>

2432
01:57:12.790 --> 01:57:13.390
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2433
01:57:13.391 --> 01:57:14.350
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

2434
01:57:14.710 --> 01:57:15.820
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe they,</v>

2435
01:57:15.821 --> 01:57:20.590
<v Speaker 6>I think he kept his lines a bit hungrier</v>
<v Speaker 6>than the ones you find at the zoo.</v>

2436
01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.650
<v Speaker 6>I think maybe the zoo's get handled.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they used to.</v>

2437
01:57:23.651 --> 01:57:26.530
<v Speaker 6>Human contact is part of that as well </v>
<v Speaker 6>and get handled.</v>

2438
01:57:26.531 --> 01:57:27.600
<v Speaker 6>Ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Zoos?</v>

2439
01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.290
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well they can't,</v>

2440
01:57:29.291 --> 01:57:32.200
<v Speaker 6>you can't handle lions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm mean you can,</v>

2441
01:57:32.201 --> 01:57:33.730
<v Speaker 6>if you train them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2442
01:57:33.731 --> 01:57:36.090
<v Speaker 6>I did a story about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2443
01:57:37.020 --> 01:57:39.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2444
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:40.900
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>siegfried and Roy,</v>

2445
01:57:40.930 --> 01:57:42.700
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>illustrates both sides of the equation.</v>

2446
01:57:42.701 --> 01:57:44.370
<v Speaker 6>I did another story.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a tigers,</v>

2447
01:57:44.380 --> 01:57:45.130
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Targets,</v>

2448
01:57:45.131 --> 01:57:50.131
<v Speaker 6>but same thing face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think tigers are a little easier to </v>

2449
01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:50.131
<v Speaker 6>train them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Lions,</v>

2450
01:57:50.131 --> 01:57:55.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't know about that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I know that I did a story called </v>

2451
01:57:55.090 --> 01:57:56.680
<v Speaker 6>America's most dangerous pets and it was</v>
<v Speaker 6>about people.</v>

2452
01:57:57.610 --> 01:58:02.610
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if this is true now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at the time it was true that there </v>

2453
01:58:02.610 --> 01:58:04.681
<v Speaker 6>are more tigers in captivity in Texas </v>
<v Speaker 6>than there are in the wild in India.</v>

2454
01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:12.120
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's thousands and thousands of </v>

2455
01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:14.100
<v Speaker 6>targets in America and um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>kept as pets in people's back yards and,</v>

2456
01:58:14.250 --> 01:58:19.250
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and what I heard again and again was </v>

2457
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:19.250
<v Speaker 6>like I will get into the cage and stroke</v>
<v Speaker 6>my tiger,</v>

2458
01:58:19.410 --> 01:58:21.970
<v Speaker 6>all my lion and cuddle it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>fine,</v>

2459
01:58:22.180 --> 01:58:24.610
<v Speaker 6>but I am not getting coast to my </v>
<v Speaker 6>monkeys.</v>

2460
01:58:25.390 --> 01:58:28.170
<v Speaker 6>The big fear was if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2461
01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:31.360
<v Speaker 6>especially chimpanzees,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they are,</v>

2462
01:58:32.050 --> 01:58:34.990
<v Speaker 6>don't go near the chimpanzees will fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>you up.</v>

2463
01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:40.020
<v Speaker 6>They will rip your nose off,</v>
<v Speaker 6>rip your balls off and eat your face.</v>

2464
01:58:40.570 --> 01:58:42.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's really</v>

2465
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:47.790
<v Speaker 4>creepy about chimpanzee attacks too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there to aware there they're too </v>

2466
01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:51.721
<v Speaker 4>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they go after they can plan and </v>

2467
01:58:51.721 --> 01:58:55.501
<v Speaker 4>they know that you at some level they </v>
<v Speaker 4>know you are the one keeping them in </v>

2468
01:58:55.501 --> 01:58:58.981
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also I think they're intelligent </v>

2469
01:58:58.981 --> 01:59:01.921
<v Speaker 4>enough to become seriously neurotic and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and dysfunctional from confinement.</v>

2470
01:59:02.980 --> 01:59:03.740
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2471
01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:09.390
<v Speaker 4>Whereas a tiger I think can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't say it's a good life for a </v>

2472
01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:12.541
<v Speaker 4>tiger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a tiger doesn't necessarily become </v>

2473
01:59:12.541 --> 01:59:12.900
<v Speaker 4>dysfunctional from being pent up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a,</v>

2474
01:59:12.901 --> 01:59:17.901
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a chimpanzee and is like a person in </v>

2475
01:59:17.901 --> 01:59:19.000
<v Speaker 4>need stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not only that,</v>

2476
01:59:19.001 --> 01:59:23.040
<v Speaker 4>they also know to go cut the video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll they also know to,</v>

2477
01:59:23.070 --> 01:59:26.110
<v Speaker 4>to go after your fingers that go off to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your balls.</v>

2478
01:59:26.320 --> 01:59:29.320
<v Speaker 4>Like they know what you want when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to keep your fingers.</v>

2479
01:59:29.321 --> 01:59:31.210
<v Speaker 4>So they bite your fingers off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's,</v>

2480
01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:34.630
<v Speaker 4>there's a certain intelligence to their </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack that's very disturbing as opposed</v>

2481
01:59:34.631 --> 01:59:36.250
<v Speaker 4>to like a tiger that just wants to kill </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2482
01:59:36.670 --> 01:59:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Tiger will bite your.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read a thing about a chimpanzee attack</v>

2483
01:59:39.441 --> 01:59:41.890
<v Speaker 4>at a zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like before I went out to do the story,</v>

2484
01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:46.840
<v Speaker 4>I was reading up on chimpanzee attacks </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I knew for the story to work,</v>

2485
01:59:46.841 --> 01:59:51.841
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably at some point have to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cuddle a chimpanzee or something like </v>

2486
01:59:51.841 --> 01:59:51.841
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2487
01:59:51.841 --> 01:59:55.590
<v Speaker 4>it was making me nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was making me more nervous than </v>

2488
01:59:55.590 --> 01:59:56.570
<v Speaker 4>the idea of going into a prison cell or </v>
<v Speaker 4>a jail cell where you know,</v>

2489
01:59:56.580 --> 02:00:01.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's enough rationality on the part </v>

2490
02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:01.580
<v Speaker 4>of the prisoner that he's not going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>attack me and bite my balls.</v>

2491
02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:02.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's not gonna shift me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2492
02:00:02.951 --> 02:00:04.660
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing in it for him.</v>

2493
02:00:05.050 --> 02:00:07.720
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why would a inmate attack a journalist?</v>

2494
02:00:07.721 --> 02:00:10.630
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the chimpanzee is not going to think</v>

2495
02:00:10.631 --> 02:00:12.490
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I read an account of a,</v>

2496
02:00:12.850 --> 02:00:15.310
<v Speaker 4>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of an attack at a pr at a zoo,</v>

2497
02:00:15.311 --> 02:00:20.311
<v Speaker 4>a chimpanzee,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the news local news turned up and </v>

2498
02:00:20.311 --> 02:00:21.190
<v Speaker 4>the chimpanzee ran over and bit the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cameraman's balls off.</v>

2499
02:00:21.970 --> 02:00:25.200
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then with that filming on my,</v>

2500
02:00:25.220 --> 02:00:28.300
<v Speaker 4>I just don't want to get in the cage </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a chimpanzee.</v>

2501
02:00:28.301 --> 02:00:30.480
<v Speaker 4>Was Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2502
02:00:30.490 --> 02:00:35.490
<v Speaker 4>No desire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no desire and almost or fucking </v>

2503
02:00:35.490 --> 02:00:35.490
<v Speaker 4>terrifying if they're a violent man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2504
02:00:35.490 --> 02:00:36.480
<v Speaker 4>really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I it,</v>

2505
02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:37.600
<v Speaker 4>that was a small one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2506
02:00:37.601 --> 02:00:38.890
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll cuddle this one.</v>

2507
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:42.580
<v Speaker 4>We had a small one on news radio wants.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a sitcom that I was on.</v>

2508
02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:44.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember news radio and he was a,</v>

2509
02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:46.720
<v Speaker 4>he was only two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2510
02:00:46.721 --> 02:00:47.320
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

2511
02:00:47.350 --> 02:00:49.630
<v Speaker 4>less than two years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe he was a baby.</v>

2512
02:00:49.631 --> 02:00:54.631
<v Speaker 4>He was small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a little Zapper on him that </v>

2513
02:00:54.631 --> 02:00:54.670
<v Speaker 4>they give him electric shocks if he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he gets out of line.</v>

2514
02:00:55.120 --> 02:01:00.120
<v Speaker 4>The one I had a hold of was a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller than that one and he climbed on </v>

2515
02:01:00.221 --> 02:01:03.640
<v Speaker 4>my back and fucking slap me on the back.</v>

2516
02:01:03.650 --> 02:01:06.370
<v Speaker 4>Just so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's so strong.</v>

2517
02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:09.200
<v Speaker 4>It was so small.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a small chimp,</v>

2518
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:11.470
<v Speaker 4>a baby chimp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was.</v>

2519
02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:17.180
<v Speaker 4>It's hard as a reference because we look</v>
<v Speaker 4>at a human that size and we look at a </v>

2520
02:01:18.791 --> 02:01:23.791
<v Speaker 4>chimp that size and we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how fucking strong could it be like a </v>

2521
02:01:23.791 --> 02:01:24.880
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a full grown man on your back?</v>

2522
02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:29.940
<v Speaker 4>It was a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it had the strength of a man like </v>

2523
02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:31.450
<v Speaker 4>the way it moved me around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would make sense because the cliche</v>

2524
02:01:31.451 --> 02:01:33.070
<v Speaker 4>and it may be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gets passed around.</v>

2525
02:01:33.071 --> 02:01:36.430
<v Speaker 4>Is that a full grown chimp?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has the strength of seven men.</v>

2526
02:01:36.490 --> 02:01:38.710
<v Speaker 4>A 500 pound man is what I've heard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2527
02:01:38.711 --> 02:01:43.711
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See that I would pay to see like a UFC </v>

2528
02:01:43.711 --> 02:01:43.850
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets to full grown chimp will.</v>

2529
02:01:43.851 --> 02:01:45.890
<v Speaker 4>You would have to take the chimps main </v>
<v Speaker 4>weapon away,</v>

2530
02:01:45.891 --> 02:01:47.890
<v Speaker 4>which is its mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2531
02:01:48.130 --> 02:01:50.930
<v Speaker 4>put a mouth guard on it or something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you would have to,</v>

2532
02:01:51.290 --> 02:01:52.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe men would,</v>

2533
02:01:52.610 --> 02:01:54.770
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they guys that would do that.</v>

2534
02:01:55.100 --> 02:02:00.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's an idiot out there that</v>
<v Speaker 4>would do almost anything that you came </v>

2535
02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.801
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys that you interviewed that </v>

2536
02:02:02.801 --> 02:02:04.871
<v Speaker 4>were progressors,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are beaten each other with a </v>

2537
02:02:04.871 --> 02:02:06.970
<v Speaker 4>fucking barbwire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure if you put a mask on one of </v>

2538
02:02:06.970 --> 02:02:06.970
<v Speaker 4>those dummies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would,</v>

2539
02:02:06.970 --> 02:02:07.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would get in there and scrap with a</v>

2540
02:02:07.851 --> 02:02:10.510
<v Speaker 4>chimpanzee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What.</v>

2541
02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:13.910
<v Speaker 4>But my point that I wanted to get back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to was the,</v>

2542
02:02:13.911 --> 02:02:14.480
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2543
02:02:14.481 --> 02:02:19.481
<v Speaker 4>the complex contradictory aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those canned hunts and Africa.</v>

2544
02:02:20.110 --> 02:02:25.110
<v Speaker 4>You had a draw on a warthog you were </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about shooting it and you're </v>

2545
02:02:25.251 --> 02:02:26.720
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this.</v>

2546
02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:28.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't make.</v>

2547
02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.210
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't make any sense.</v>

2548
02:02:29.211 --> 02:02:30.530
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2549
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:31.760
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2550
02:02:31.800 --> 02:02:36.800
<v Speaker 3>it was just the whole situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that I'm going to take the life</v>

2551
02:02:37.761 --> 02:02:42.761
<v Speaker 3>of this animal just to indulge my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>sense of either what I think I need for </v>

2552
02:02:44.211 --> 02:02:47.240
<v Speaker 3>this program to work or my sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2553
02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:52.280
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to experience a experience </v>

2554
02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:52.410
<v Speaker 3>this to see what it feels like to take.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't feel.</v>

2555
02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:55.820
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't feel an urge to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I could have forced myself if you'd</v>

2556
02:02:55.821 --> 02:02:57.110
<v Speaker 3>put a gun to my head and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

2557
02:02:57.111 --> 02:03:02.111
<v Speaker 3>I would have done it of course course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if you were starving to death if I </v>

2558
02:03:02.111 --> 02:03:02.111
<v Speaker 3>was starving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just to do it.</v>

2559
02:03:02.111 --> 02:03:03.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see what this feels like.</v>

2560
02:03:03.650 --> 02:03:04.640
<v Speaker 3>It didn't feel right.</v>

2561
02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:08.370
<v Speaker 4>You had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you captured some of the more disturbing</v>

2562
02:03:08.371 --> 02:03:13.371
<v Speaker 4>aspects of hunting on that show because </v>
<v Speaker 4>those people were not doing it to </v>

2563
02:03:13.371 --> 02:03:16.590
<v Speaker 4>acquire meat at all and you see they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>trophy hunters.</v>

2564
02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:20.490
<v Speaker 4>They're trophy hunters and they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it to acquire,</v>

2565
02:03:20.491 --> 02:03:25.491
<v Speaker 4>meet these people were doing it to to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have this to kill things and the video </v>

2566
02:03:27.631 --> 02:03:32.631
<v Speaker 4>of them being all joyful and happy when </v>
<v Speaker 4>they all got together and compared notes</v>

2567
02:03:34.291 --> 02:03:39.291
<v Speaker 4>after their individual hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like several individual hunting parties </v>

2568
02:03:39.291 --> 02:03:39.291
<v Speaker 4>had went out,</v>

2569
02:03:39.291 --> 02:03:43.190
<v Speaker 3>came out like after the second day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first full day of hunting and then </v>

2570
02:03:43.190 --> 02:03:46.471
<v Speaker 3>we do an inventory of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got like three zippers to Kudu,</v>

2571
02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:52.320
<v Speaker 3>a gazelle and it was an inventory of </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind and and you can sort of pick them </v>

2572
02:03:52.811 --> 02:03:57.180
<v Speaker 3>out like they're on a shopping list and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know it's like 5,000</v>

2573
02:03:57.190 --> 02:04:01.920
<v Speaker 3>for a Kudu and it's 3000 for a Zipper </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's $20,000</v>

2574
02:04:01.921 --> 02:04:06.921
<v Speaker 3>for a giraffe and $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>for a rhino and stuff I thought was </v>

2575
02:04:06.921 --> 02:04:10.411
<v Speaker 3>endangered is you can actually I guess </v>
<v Speaker 3>not endangered and you can pay enough.</v>

2576
02:04:11.050 --> 02:04:12.520
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought rhinos were endangered.</v>

2577
02:04:13.090 --> 02:04:15.540
<v Speaker 3>The guy who reinforced loop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who,</v>

2578
02:04:15.550 --> 02:04:17.550
<v Speaker 3>who ran the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said if you want one,</v>

2579
02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I can get you 20.</v>

2580
02:04:19.320 --> 02:04:20.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How fucking crazy is that?</v>

2581
02:04:20.890 --> 02:04:22.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were $100,000</v>

2582
02:04:22.361 --> 02:04:23.200
<v Speaker 4>American,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

2583
02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:26.020
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was what was going on in America.</v>

2584
02:04:26.021 --> 02:04:31.021
<v Speaker 4>There was a big issue recently all over </v>
<v Speaker 4>the news where there was a safari club </v>

2585
02:04:31.021 --> 02:04:35.820
<v Speaker 4>that had auction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was in Dallas and they'd auction off </v>

2586
02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:38.431
<v Speaker 4>a hunt for an endangered rhino and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea was that all this that they had </v>

2587
02:04:38.431 --> 02:04:43.131
<v Speaker 4>auctioned off would go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a controversy about it that's </v>

2588
02:04:43.131 --> 02:04:44.490
<v Speaker 4>really nice and it was also </v>
<v Speaker 4>controversial because they were going to</v>

2589
02:04:44.491 --> 02:04:49.491
<v Speaker 4>have to do something with that rhino </v>
<v Speaker 4>because it was an old rhino and the old </v>

2590
02:04:49.491 --> 02:04:51.420
<v Speaker 4>rhinos will kill the young males.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't breed anymore,</v>

2591
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:56.510
<v Speaker 4>but they're still.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're very aggressive and territorial </v>

2592
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:57.570
<v Speaker 4>and they'll destroy the breeding male </v>
<v Speaker 4>population.</v>

2593
02:04:57.571 --> 02:05:01.140
<v Speaker 4>They'll actually kill some of them and </v>
<v Speaker 4>so they had to remove them.</v>

2594
02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:05.550
<v Speaker 4>They had to remove this rhino in order </v>
<v Speaker 4>to keep the herd healthy.</v>

2595
02:05:05.770 --> 02:05:10.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the thing like if you want to </v>

2596
02:05:10.770 --> 02:05:12.361
<v Speaker 3>see the most grisly way more grizzly end</v>
<v Speaker 3>up studying than any kind of UFC a show </v>

2597
02:05:12.361 --> 02:05:17.221
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your nature program with the </v>

2598
02:05:17.221 --> 02:05:20.221
<v Speaker 3>elephants getting lost in the mist and </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting attacked by like the level of </v>

2599
02:05:20.221 --> 02:05:24.690
<v Speaker 3>Gore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the like snuff films in a </v>

2600
02:05:24.690 --> 02:05:24.690
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2601
02:05:24.690 --> 02:05:29.160
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think one thing that Ted nugent </v>

2602
02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:31.650
<v Speaker 3>used to say when I was filming with him </v>
<v Speaker 3>was he objected to the disneyfication of</v>

2603
02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:34.270
<v Speaker 3>our experience of the natural world.</v>

2604
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:36.040
<v Speaker 4>I think he's got an excellent point </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2605
02:05:36.310 --> 02:05:36.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2606
02:05:36.841 --> 02:05:37.980
<v Speaker 4>he's got an excellent point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2607
02:05:38.140 --> 02:05:41.140
<v Speaker 4>think about the animals that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we take this,</v>

2608
02:05:41.170 --> 02:05:45.180
<v Speaker 4>this weird approach with like polar </v>
<v Speaker 4>bears or a,</v>

2609
02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:49.600
<v Speaker 4>the grizzly bears like Yogi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We turned them into our friends.</v>

2610
02:05:49.830 --> 02:05:51.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>polar bears are the weirdest ones.</v>

2611
02:05:51.551 --> 02:05:54.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>polar bears are like Klondike bars.</v>

2612
02:05:54.731 --> 02:05:56.620
<v Speaker 4>What would you do for a Klondike Bar?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or they're,</v>

2613
02:05:56.621 --> 02:05:58.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking drinking coke.</v>

2614
02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:04.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this weird thing that we do with </v>

2615
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:04.080
<v Speaker 4>the anthropomorph Promar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>phising,</v>

2616
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.890
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these really violent,</v>

2617
02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:10.891
<v Speaker 4>dangerous animals and some of the more </v>
<v Speaker 4>violent and more dangerous animals are </v>

2618
02:06:10.891 --> 02:06:14.941
<v Speaker 4>the ones that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we may come cuddly and cute and </v>

2619
02:06:14.941 --> 02:06:18.060
<v Speaker 4>bizarrely twist their nature up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's sometimes the only exposure that </v>

2620
02:06:19.931 --> 02:06:23.500
<v Speaker 4>people have to these animals for a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2621
02:06:23.620 --> 02:06:26.530
<v Speaker 4>Like my children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my children.</v>

2622
02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:31.610
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a five year old and a three year </v>

2623
02:06:31.610 --> 02:06:34.141
<v Speaker 4>old that are just starting to understand</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the animals that they see in </v>

2624
02:06:34.141 --> 02:06:36.580
<v Speaker 4>cartoons are not real animals and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>real animals don't talk.</v>

2625
02:06:36.610 --> 02:06:38.440
<v Speaker 4>Real animals are very different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>

2626
02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:40.930
<v Speaker 4>they obviously see the five-year-old </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially sees that.</v>

2627
02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:46.260
<v Speaker 4>But I'm starting to explain to her that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you ever see a bear like bears are </v>

2628
02:06:46.481 --> 02:06:48.700
<v Speaker 4>not to be approached and they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>cuddly.</v>

2629
02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:53.701
<v Speaker 4>They're not your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a real big difference </v>

2630
02:06:53.701 --> 02:06:55.981
<v Speaker 4>between a bear that's trained like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bear in a movie and a bear that you see </v>

2631
02:06:55.981 --> 02:06:58.180
<v Speaker 4>in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so then like while their dogs in the</v>

2632
02:06:58.181 --> 02:07:01.180
<v Speaker 4>wild will not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes there are.</v>

2633
02:07:01.181 --> 02:07:06.181
<v Speaker 4>And if you see a wild dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are dangerous as well because the </v>

2634
02:07:06.181 --> 02:07:09.301
<v Speaker 4>only thing that's not dangerous about </v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs is that they are pets and that we </v>

2635
02:07:09.301 --> 02:07:10.270
<v Speaker 4>train them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we get them used to people.</v>

2636
02:07:10.271 --> 02:07:13.870
<v Speaker 4>So there's this weird relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals that I have to sort of relate to</v>

2637
02:07:13.871 --> 02:07:16.210
<v Speaker 4>my children.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then in doing so,</v>

2638
02:07:16.211 --> 02:07:21.211
<v Speaker 4>I start to review this bizarre thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we have this weird relationship </v>

2639
02:07:22.001 --> 02:07:23.590
<v Speaker 4>that we have to certain animals.</v>

2640
02:07:24.450 --> 02:07:25.200
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2641
02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:30.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we really know how we feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>about a lot of animals and if we gave </v>

2642
02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:35.100
<v Speaker 3>half as much thought to the conditions </v>
<v Speaker 3>in industrial,</v>

2643
02:07:35.110 --> 02:07:40.110
<v Speaker 3>in factory farms in the way our chickens</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pigs are raised as we do to,</v>

2644
02:07:42.590 --> 02:07:43.950
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2645
02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:45.880
<v Speaker 3>endangered species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2646
02:07:45.881 --> 02:07:50.881
<v Speaker 3>I'm more concerned about that in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the conditions of how our food is </v>

2647
02:07:51.341 --> 02:07:52.740
<v Speaker 3>created,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2648
02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:57.750
<v Speaker 3>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that pigs get fed their own minced up </v>

2649
02:07:57.750 --> 02:07:58.270
<v Speaker 3>piglets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2650
02:07:58.271 --> 02:07:58.720
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2651
02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:01.840
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all kinds of hideous practices.</v>

2652
02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2653
02:08:03.371 --> 02:08:03.880
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2654
02:08:03.881 --> 02:08:07.630
<v Speaker 1>it's very hideous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a great deal of disgusting,</v>

2655
02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:09.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practices that,</v>

2656
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.860
<v Speaker 1>that are involved in agriculture and </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming and taking care of livestock.</v>

2657
02:08:14.861 --> 02:08:16.720
<v Speaker 1>And mad cow disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2658
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>England had a huge issue with which,</v>

2659
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:22.060
<v Speaker 1>because they were being fed their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own offspring.</v>

2660
02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And brain tissue.</v>

2661
02:08:23.801 --> 02:08:28.801
<v Speaker 1>When an animal eats brain tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the same disease that cannibals </v>

2662
02:08:28.841 --> 02:08:31.330
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob fell disease,</v>

2663
02:08:31.670 --> 02:08:34.270
<v Speaker 1>which I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2664
02:08:34.370 --> 02:08:35.500
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the way to say it.</v>

2665
02:08:35.740 --> 02:08:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is exactly what it is.</v>

2666
02:08:38.451 --> 02:08:43.451
<v Speaker 1>It's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have these animals that are eating </v>

2667
02:08:43.451 --> 02:08:46.051
<v Speaker 1>brain tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing as humans that </v>

2668
02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:47.800
<v Speaker 1>cannibalize your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's fucked.</v>

2669
02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:50.320
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really crazy.</v>

2670
02:08:50.321 --> 02:08:51.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird thing,</v>

2671
02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

2672
02:08:52.660 --> 02:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we de-humanize and we also allow </v>

2673
02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:01.591
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to put money above humanity </v>
<v Speaker 1>about above ethics and morality.</v>

2674
02:09:02.051 --> 02:09:07.051
<v Speaker 1>And when it comes to animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more profitable to stuff them into </v>

2675
02:09:07.051 --> 02:09:11.461
<v Speaker 1>containers and where they can barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>move and just feed them their own </v>

2676
02:09:11.461 --> 02:09:11.570
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2677
02:09:11.590 --> 02:09:15.100
<v Speaker 1>and fatten them up and then sell them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise that body,</v>

2678
02:09:15.130 --> 02:09:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2679
02:09:15.531 --> 02:09:20.531
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dead babies or whatever the fuck </v>

2680
02:09:20.531 --> 02:09:21.760
<v Speaker 1>they feed them goes to waste the parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't use for hamburger.</v>

2681
02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:23.140
<v Speaker 1>And what have you goes to waste.</v>

2682
02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:26.880
<v Speaker 3>And did you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean probably everyone knows this,</v>

2683
02:09:26.881 --> 02:09:27.900
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

2684
02:09:27.901 --> 02:09:31.350
<v Speaker 3>in the world of egg raising chickens for</v>
<v Speaker 3>eggs,</v>

2685
02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:36.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all a male hatchlings get mashed up </v>

2686
02:09:36.740 --> 02:09:38.330
<v Speaker 3>within a couple of days of being born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2687
02:09:39.150 --> 02:09:40.250
<v Speaker 3>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

2688
02:09:40.270 --> 02:09:42.960
<v Speaker 3>so this is about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the figure was like 10</v>

2689
02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:46.130
<v Speaker 3>million baby chicks every year I went </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight into meat grinders.</v>

2690
02:09:46.131 --> 02:09:46.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2691
02:09:46.690 --> 02:09:48.520
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2692
02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:53.880
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird and hard to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to wrap your head around the </v>

2693
02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:56.881
<v Speaker 1>fact that people can detach so much from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing to do something like </v>

2694
02:09:57.101 --> 02:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

2695
02:09:58.420 --> 02:09:59.550
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2696
02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:02.890
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take a person who knows what's.</v>

2697
02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2698
02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:08.800
<v Speaker 1>if you did that in front of someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>you cared about,</v>

2699
02:10:09.380 --> 02:10:12.910
<v Speaker 1>you valued their opinion and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you started feeding these,</v>

2700
02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:17.960
<v Speaker 1>these chickens a torn up chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He started giving a cow,</v>

2701
02:10:18.521 --> 02:10:21.790
<v Speaker 1>a cow brains and cow meat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2702
02:10:21.791 --> 02:10:22.220
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2703
02:10:22.221 --> 02:10:24.760
<v Speaker 1>and mashing them up and feeding them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

2704
02:10:24.761 --> 02:10:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Like someone will go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing,</v>

2705
02:10:26.891 --> 02:10:27.940
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing that?</v>

2706
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:30.700
<v Speaker 1>Cows don't eat cows like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing,</v>

2707
02:10:30.701 --> 02:10:31.150
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2708
02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:32.730
<v Speaker 1>make us more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

2709
02:10:32.731 --> 02:10:34.370
<v Speaker 1>He really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you.</v>

2710
02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.400
<v Speaker 1>That's how you're going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to maximize your bottom </v>

2711
02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:42.311
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to feed them cow brains </v>

2712
02:10:42.311 --> 02:10:44.770
<v Speaker 1>and they see the cows all shaky and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up because their neurological </v>

2713
02:10:44.770 --> 02:10:46.400
<v Speaker 1>system is rejecting this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This notion there,</v>

2714
02:10:46.401 --> 02:10:48.230
<v Speaker 1>they're rejecting the this practice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

2715
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:53.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature actually has a whole system </v>

2716
02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:55.781
<v Speaker 1>set in place to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of discouraged cannibalism and </v>

2717
02:10:55.781 --> 02:11:00.700
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannibalize in nature fucks your </v>

2718
02:11:00.700 --> 02:11:02.060
<v Speaker 1>immune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your nervous system.</v>

2719
02:11:03.130 --> 02:11:03.800
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

2720
02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:05.010
<v Speaker 3>Did you read about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

2721
02:11:05.090 --> 02:11:07.030
<v Speaker 3>what I wanted to ask you about news </v>
<v Speaker 3>radio though,</v>

2722
02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:12.040
<v Speaker 3>because you may not know this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I started out in a trying to </v>

2723
02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:12.280
<v Speaker 3>break into TV,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my f,</v>

2724
02:11:12.670 --> 02:11:17.670
<v Speaker 3>my first objective before I had my own </v>
<v Speaker 3>show was to write for news radio and </v>

2725
02:11:18.221 --> 02:11:21.160
<v Speaker 3>actually wrote a spec script and sent it</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Paul Simms.</v>

2726
02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:23.080
<v Speaker 3>Ha Ha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's no kidding.</v>

2727
02:11:24.190 --> 02:11:29.190
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got a meeting on the back of the </v>

2728
02:11:29.190 --> 02:11:31.231
<v Speaker 3>script and it was sunset gower lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

2729
02:11:31.290 --> 02:11:36.290
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You remember where we were taping that </v>

2730
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:38.670
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the end I went off to do my own </v>

2731
02:11:38.670 --> 02:11:38.670
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2732
02:11:38.670 --> 02:11:39.250
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2733
02:11:39.370 --> 02:11:44.370
<v Speaker 3>I just thought it was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all that was my dream was to back </v>

2734
02:11:44.370 --> 02:11:44.370
<v Speaker 3>in the Phil Hartman days.</v>

2735
02:11:44.740 --> 02:11:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's incredible,</v>

2736
02:11:45.911 --> 02:11:47.500

<v Speaker 1>That's incredible.</v>

2737
02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you keep up with those guys at all?</v>

2738
02:11:50.100 --> 02:11:51.330
<v Speaker 1>Occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just,</v>

2739
02:11:51.331 --> 02:11:52.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to see.</v>

2740
02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:55.470
<v Speaker 1>He was communicating with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked on the crew last night.</v>

2741
02:11:55.471 --> 02:11:57.000
<v Speaker 1>We were emailing each other back and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

2742
02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what Sims is up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2743

<v Speaker 1>empire.</v>

2744
02:12:00.961 --> 02:12:03.750
<v Speaker 1>That's why I had her as a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is writing on boardwalk empire.</v>

2745
02:12:04.110 --> 02:12:06.090
<v Speaker 1>He's such a fascinating guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's brilliant,</v>

2746
02:12:06.091 --> 02:12:08.970
<v Speaker 1>brilliant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just curiosity.</v>

2747
02:12:08.971 --> 02:12:10.650
<v Speaker 1>He was a real eccentric.</v>

2748
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:16.270
<v Speaker 3>He'd come off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He'd worked at spy where I'd worked </v>

2749
02:12:16.270 --> 02:12:18.950
<v Speaker 3>the magazine and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people kept saying that I looked </v>

2750
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:20.060
<v Speaker 3>like him and I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I fixated on it and I thought,</v>

2751
02:12:20.061 --> 02:12:21.830
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and everyone said,</v>

2752
02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:26.860
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was so funny and he didn't stay very </v>

2753
02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:26.860
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was so talented and he went on to</v>

2754
02:12:26.860 --> 02:12:29.720
<v Speaker 3>do letterman and then from letterman he </v>
<v Speaker 3>went to Larry Sanders and uh,</v>

2755
02:12:29.721 --> 02:12:32.840
<v Speaker 3>Larry Sanders at that time was viewed as</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of the pinnacle of kind of smart,</v>

2756
02:12:32.841 --> 02:12:34.070
<v Speaker 3>funny TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

2757
02:12:34.071 --> 02:12:36.380
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I could get on Larry Sanders,</v>

2758
02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:41.440
<v Speaker 3>that would be amazing as a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he went and started his own </v>

2759
02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:41.440
<v Speaker 3>show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was news radio.</v>

2760
02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:43.490
<v Speaker 3>And I thought so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well maybe that'll be a smart,</v>

2761
02:12:43.491 --> 02:12:45.860
<v Speaker 3>funny show as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I should do.</v>

2762
02:12:45.861 --> 02:12:49.040
<v Speaker 3>So I wrote a script to winter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I remember going along there and,</v>

2763
02:12:49.130 --> 02:12:51.350
<v Speaker 3>and all the windows were blacked out </v>
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

2764
02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:53.650
<v Speaker 3>with a tin foil,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with aluminum exit.</v>

2765
02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:54.680
<v Speaker 3>Come along for a meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

2766
02:12:54.681 --> 02:12:55.190
<v Speaker 3>what time?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

2767
02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:57.710
<v Speaker 3>well normally I get in around six in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>evening.</v>

2768
02:12:58.100 --> 02:12:58.700
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2769
02:12:58.850 --> 02:13:00.740
<v Speaker 3>CCS time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people go home,</v>

2770
02:13:00.741 --> 02:13:05.741
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went along and he was hanging out </v>

2771
02:13:05.741 --> 02:13:05.741
<v Speaker 3>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2772
02:13:05.741 --> 02:13:05.741
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

2773
02:13:05.741 --> 02:13:08.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm a runner or pa or something called </v>
<v Speaker 3>spider,</v>

2774
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:10.940
<v Speaker 3>spider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spider.</v>

2775
02:13:10.941 --> 02:13:12.410
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what kind of music do you like?</v>

2776
02:13:12.411 --> 02:13:13.910
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if this is this,</v>

2777
02:13:13.911 --> 02:13:18.911
<v Speaker 3>the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's asking me what kind of music </v>

2778
02:13:18.911 --> 02:13:18.911
<v Speaker 3>and then I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was just weird,</v>

2779
02:13:18.911 --> 02:13:21.230
<v Speaker 3>like there was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was no sense of night or day.</v>

2780
02:13:21.890 --> 02:13:24.280
<v Speaker 3>No natural light windows all blocked </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2781
02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:29.300
<v Speaker 3>He's hanging with spider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just thought this is kind of the </v>

2782
02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:29.300
<v Speaker 3>spider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was getting kind of slight,</v>

2783
02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:31.410
<v Speaker 3>very faint cult vibes.</v>

2784
02:13:31.850 --> 02:13:33.970
<v Speaker 9>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>there's a little lag going on.</v>

2785
02:13:33.971 --> 02:13:34.470
<v Speaker 9>But in a good</v>

2786
02:13:35.380 --> 02:13:37.310
<v Speaker 3>they um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would work all night.</v>

2787
02:13:37.370 --> 02:13:39.020
<v Speaker 3>And those were his hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

2788
02:13:39.021 --> 02:13:44.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well he knew everyone had to fit in </v>

2789
02:13:44.021 --> 02:13:44.021
<v Speaker 3>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2790
02:13:44.021 --> 02:13:44.030
<v Speaker 3>If you had a family or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2791
02:13:44.031 --> 02:13:45.970
<v Speaker 3>you were fucked because they would do a </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>

2792
02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:47.310
<v Speaker 3>But that didn't affect you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2793
02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:48.800
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't affect us at all.</v>

2794
02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:53.980
<v Speaker 3>The actors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's sort of union rules for </v>

2795
02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:54.470
<v Speaker 3>actors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't make us start work at 2:00</v>

2796
02:13:54.471 --> 02:13:56.670
<v Speaker 3>in the morning feed to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were a writer.</v>

2797
02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:57.590
<v Speaker 3>Then you turn on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2798
02:13:57.591 --> 02:13:58.050
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2799
02:13:58.070 --> 02:14:01.400
<v Speaker 3>that we work from six in the evening </v>
<v Speaker 3>till four in the morning.</v>

2800
02:14:01.401 --> 02:14:02.830
<v Speaker 3>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2801
02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:05.600
<v Speaker 3>we like to hang out with spider and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically,</v>

2802
02:14:05.601 --> 02:14:09.140
<v Speaker 3>we all play Yahtzee for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hours and then we worked for half.</v>

2803
02:14:09.170 --> 02:14:10.340
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't literally that,</v>

2804
02:14:10.341 --> 02:14:11.510
<v Speaker 3>but it was Kinda like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

2805
02:14:11.511 --> 02:14:16.511
<v Speaker 3>it's like that episode of the twilight </v>
<v Speaker 3>zone where the kid is in charge of the </v>

2806
02:14:16.511 --> 02:14:16.511
<v Speaker 3>family</v>

2807
02:14:16.511 --> 02:14:16.511
<v Speaker 9>and they're all like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>

2808
02:14:18.310 --> 02:14:19.030
<v Speaker 9>well he had a method,</v>

2809
02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:20.930
<v Speaker 4>his madness and the message of Bhutan </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2810
02:14:20.970 --> 02:14:25.970
<v Speaker 4>you're very talented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the method to his madness was that </v>

2811
02:14:25.970 --> 02:14:28.280
<v Speaker 4>you get silly when you are a sleep </v>
<v Speaker 4>deficit mode when you're really,</v>

2812
02:14:28.810 --> 02:14:33.810
<v Speaker 4>you're really late and tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And oftentimes that's when the most </v>

2813
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:33.810
<v Speaker 4>preposterous ideas are allowed to come.</v>

2814
02:14:33.810 --> 02:14:36.240
<v Speaker 3>That was his theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was the practice.</v>

2815
02:14:36.330 --> 02:14:37.610
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really did work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't,</v>

2816
02:14:37.611 --> 02:14:39.360
<v Speaker 3>but it was that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

2817
02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:42.540
<v Speaker 3>did he articulate that or was that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>oftenly articulated it.</v>

2818
02:14:42.570 --> 02:14:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was.</v>

2819
02:14:43.381 --> 02:14:45.840
<v Speaker 3>But it's Kinda like Vanna earhart saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2820
02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:48.990
<v Speaker 3>after you stayed awake for 48 hours in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>peed your pants,</v>

2821
02:14:48.991 --> 02:14:51.300
<v Speaker 3>then you have an enlightenment </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>

2822
02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:52.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>

2823
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:54.240
<v Speaker 3>But maybe there's another way of doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2824
02:14:54.270 --> 02:14:56.460
<v Speaker 3>They were definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of ways,</v>

2825
02:14:56.461 --> 02:14:58.830
<v Speaker 3>there were definitely lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can I tell you,</v>

2826
02:14:58.831 --> 02:15:03.750
<v Speaker 3>my theory is that like if you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 3>made a creative breakthrough by 6:00</v>

2827
02:15:03.780 --> 02:15:05.460
<v Speaker 3>in the evening,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then hey,</v>

2828
02:15:05.461 --> 02:15:10.461
<v Speaker 3>why don't you go home and have a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>night's sleep and try again the next </v>

2829
02:15:10.461 --> 02:15:10.461
<v Speaker 3>morning?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2830
02:15:10.461 --> 02:15:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I think they liked the idea of working </v>
<v Speaker 3>under the</v>

2831
02:15:13.070 --> 02:15:18.070
<v Speaker 4>wire as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they would oftentimes deliver </v>

2832
02:15:18.070 --> 02:15:21.211
<v Speaker 4>the script for the run through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we had to run through in the </v>

2833
02:15:21.211 --> 02:15:21.211
<v Speaker 4>morning or a table read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2834
02:15:21.211 --> 02:15:22.900
<v Speaker 4>so if the table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was Monday morning,</v>

2835
02:15:22.901 --> 02:15:25.530
<v Speaker 4>Sunday night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would still be working.</v>

2836
02:15:25.690 --> 02:15:27.580
<v Speaker 4>If we had to be at the table read at </v>
<v Speaker 4>9:00</v>

2837
02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:29.260
<v Speaker 4>AM,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will be writing at 8:00</v>

2838
02:15:29.260 --> 02:15:31.600
<v Speaker 4>AM.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like sometimes we would get,</v>

2839
02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:33.500
<v Speaker 4>we would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd go to rehearse,</v>

2840
02:15:33.501 --> 02:15:36.790
<v Speaker 4>we'd have no table read and we would </v>
<v Speaker 4>wind up rehearsing the first,</v>

2841
02:15:36.850 --> 02:15:37.660
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first,</v>

2842
02:15:37.710 --> 02:15:39.850
<v Speaker 4>like five pages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all they had.</v>

2843
02:15:40.080 --> 02:15:41.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we wouldn't have a full script.</v>

2844
02:15:42.010 --> 02:15:45.070
<v Speaker 4>We'd have five pages.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then while we were rehearsing,</v>

2845
02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Josh Lee would come stumbling down </v>

2846
02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:50.280
<v Speaker 4>barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His hair would be all fucked up,</v>

2847
02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:51.190
<v Speaker 4>be smoking a cigarette.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2848
02:15:51.191 --> 02:15:52.120
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2849
02:15:52.210 --> 02:15:57.210
<v Speaker 4>here's the next 20 pages and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the next x amount of pages and we would </v>

2850
02:15:57.210 --> 02:15:59.050
<v Speaker 4>go over that and then the next day they </v>
<v Speaker 4>would.</v>

2851
02:15:59.470 --> 02:16:02.140
<v Speaker 4>But it always came together as a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>solid</v>

2852
02:16:02.820 --> 02:16:07.820
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Michael Moore was a little like </v>

2853
02:16:07.820 --> 02:16:08.970
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the feeling that unless your guts</v>

2854
02:16:08.971 --> 02:16:10.500
<v Speaker 3>are on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2855
02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:15.570
<v Speaker 3>then there's a chance you might have </v>
<v Speaker 3>been able to improve it with more work.</v>

2856
02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like stay late and worry and worry and </v>

2857
02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.450
<v Speaker 3>worry and stay late and work on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekends until you just despair and you </v>

2858
02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:25.590
<v Speaker 3>just think I can't give anything more to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the process.</v>

2859
02:16:25.620 --> 02:16:27.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has their own method,</v>

2860
02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:29.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as far as the creative process.</v>

2861
02:16:29.170 --> 02:16:30.060
<v Speaker 3>And I'm</v>

2862
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:31.780
<v Speaker 4>not saying that their method was the </v>
<v Speaker 4>best,</v>

2863
02:16:31.781 --> 02:16:36.350
<v Speaker 4>but it was fun for them and part of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>the young family,</v>

2864
02:16:36.460 --> 02:16:39.250
<v Speaker 4>they're all single.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a few guys that were family guys</v>

2865
02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:41.110
<v Speaker 4>that had real issues and wound up </v>
<v Speaker 4>leaving,</v>

2866
02:16:41.170 --> 02:16:45.160
<v Speaker 4>but they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were having fun and that having fun</v>

2867
02:16:45.161 --> 02:16:50.161
<v Speaker 4>led them to be funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think whether or not it was a </v>

2868
02:16:50.770 --> 02:16:53.140
<v Speaker 4>consequence of their laziness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was so good,</v>

2869
02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:55.690
<v Speaker 4>or whether it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a method to their madness.</v>

2870
02:16:55.691 --> 02:17:00.691
<v Speaker 4>I mean you would really have to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>that up with Paul and he would have to </v>

2871
02:17:00.691 --> 02:17:01.240
<v Speaker 4>really soul search to find the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>correct answer.</v>

2872
02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:03.880
<v Speaker 4>But it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really worked.</v>

2873
02:17:03.881 --> 02:17:06.820
<v Speaker 4>And it was an amazing cost as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it was you,</v>

2874
02:17:06.850 --> 02:17:11.850

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2892
02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:51.391
<v Speaker 4>I was married in Canada and Canada has </v>
<v Speaker 4>some crazy laws where the wife has </v>

2893
02:17:51.391 --> 02:17:53.320
<v Speaker 4>access to the bank account for a full </v>
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>

2894
02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:57.220
<v Speaker 4>a while you're getting divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not allowed to get divorced until</v>

2895
02:17:57.221 --> 02:18:02.221
<v Speaker 4>you're separated for a year or at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time this was the and they also have </v>

2896
02:18:02.221 --> 02:18:06.691
<v Speaker 4>like insane laws as far as like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of child support you're supposed </v>

2897
02:18:06.691 --> 02:18:06.691
<v Speaker 4>to pay.</v>

2898
02:18:06.691 --> 02:18:10.290
<v Speaker 4>His child support was based on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>highest income he had ever made in his </v>

2899
02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:10.290
<v Speaker 4>life and unbelievably unrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some.</v>

2900
02:18:10.290 --> 02:18:12.640
<v Speaker 4>It was the height of his career when he </v>
<v Speaker 4>was on news radio,</v>

2901
02:18:12.641 --> 02:18:17.641
<v Speaker 4>so he's making an extraordinary amount </v>
<v Speaker 4>of money and that that was what his </v>

2902
02:18:17.641 --> 02:18:19.660
<v Speaker 4>child support was based on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so he had to pay that for the 18 years.</v>

2903
02:18:19.661 --> 02:18:24.661
<v Speaker 4>His children were alive and it was all </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to his wife and his wife was </v>

2904
02:18:24.661 --> 02:18:26.230
<v Speaker 4>redecorating the fucking house and begin</v>
<v Speaker 4>to hate her.</v>

2905
02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:27.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

2906
02:18:27.431 --> 02:18:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So don't you like that?</v>

2907
02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:32.230
<v Speaker 4>I just love that whole dynamic is very </v>
<v Speaker 4>strange.</v>

2908
02:18:32.770 --> 02:18:34.630
<v Speaker 4>Love someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You love them so much.</v>

2909
02:18:34.631 --> 02:18:39.631
<v Speaker 4>You're willing to sign a legal contract </v>
<v Speaker 4>with them and then they become your </v>

2910
02:18:39.631 --> 02:18:42.841
<v Speaker 4>sworn enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and of course obviously I've dealt with </v>

2911
02:18:42.841 --> 02:18:43.720
<v Speaker 4>that with Phil Hartman in his wife or </v>
<v Speaker 4>his wife,</v>

2912
02:18:43.721 --> 02:18:47.140
<v Speaker 4>shot him in his sleep and then there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>still together though they had when they</v>

2913
02:18:47.141 --> 02:18:52.141
<v Speaker 4>were getting broken up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they were living together but </v>

2914
02:18:52.141 --> 02:18:52.141
<v Speaker 4>separated.</v>

2915

<v Speaker 4>They had broken up and you know,</v>

2918
02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:02.200
<v Speaker 4>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had a boat and slept in his boat for </v>

2919
02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:05.281
<v Speaker 4>a while and then came back to her and </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to keep the family together and </v>

2920
02:19:05.281 --> 02:19:06.850
<v Speaker 4>was trying hard to kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2921
02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:07.760
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very.</v>

2922
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:09.230
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2923
02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:14.520
<v Speaker 4>when people just are committed in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of a situation where they have to </v>

2924
02:19:14.520 --> 02:19:18.250
<v Speaker 4>stay or if they do stay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's devastating to their lifestyle,</v>

2925
02:19:18.251 --> 02:19:21.390
<v Speaker 4>devastating to their emotional state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2926
02:19:21.391 --> 02:19:26.391
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very troubling and very scary when </v>

2927
02:19:26.391 --> 02:19:26.500
<v Speaker 4>they started attacking each other as </v>
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>

2928
02:19:26.530 --> 02:19:28.070
<v Speaker 4>When they know they go after each</v>

2929
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:29.540
<v Speaker 1>other to try to hurt that person.</v>

2930
02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:31.190
<v Speaker 3>Did you get on with Andy Dick?</v>

2931
02:19:31.660 --> 02:19:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I got on occasionally with Andy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a love hate sort of a situation.</v>

2932
02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:38.710
<v Speaker 1>He to this day maintains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all my fault.</v>

2933
02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:42.280
<v Speaker 1>He was so angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always angry.</v>

2934
02:19:42.530 --> 02:19:46.360
<v Speaker 1>White Guy was pulling his dick out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of me and jerking off my trailer.</v>

2935
02:19:46.361 --> 02:19:48.790
<v Speaker 1>When my girlfriend was in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would show up,</v>

2936
02:19:48.791 --> 02:19:51.490
<v Speaker 1>so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't read the script and he would</v>

2937
02:19:51.491 --> 02:19:54.460
<v Speaker 1>forget his kid and leave them on set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

2938
02:19:54.970 --> 02:19:56.790
<v Speaker 1>incredibly talented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very funny,</v>

2939
02:19:57.340 --> 02:20:00.880
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had more laughs like rehearsing scenes</v>

2940
02:20:00.881 --> 02:20:04.600
<v Speaker 1>with that guy and doing scenes in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy than anybody in my life.</v>

2941
02:20:04.810 --> 02:20:07.690
<v Speaker 1>He's an unbelievably talented guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deep down inside.</v>

2942
02:20:07.720 --> 02:20:10.180
<v Speaker 1>He's a sweet guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's very troubled.</v>

2943
02:20:10.210 --> 02:20:14.890
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't even remember his childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he's missing like up until like,</v>

2944
02:20:15.790 --> 02:20:18.100
<v Speaker 1>like before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like age seven or something like that.</v>

2945
02:20:18.310 --> 02:20:21.220
<v Speaker 1>He literally doesn't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was adopted.</v>

2946
02:20:21.220 --> 02:20:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Locked it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2947
02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:25.180
<v Speaker 1>He's had some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had some hard times,</v>

2948
02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2949
02:20:26.021 --> 02:20:30.160
<v Speaker 1>you don't create a guy like Andy Dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything turns out perfect.</v>

2950
02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:32.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the product of a lot of angst and a</v>

2951
02:20:32.891 --> 02:20:35.350
<v Speaker 1>lot of issues and a lot of what have </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2952
02:20:35.351 --> 02:20:37.280
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2953
02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:40.240
<v Speaker 1>looking at the glass half full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant guy,</v>

2954
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:45.270
<v Speaker 1>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant comedic actor and it disturbs </v>

2955
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.650
<v Speaker 1>me when I see him go off and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2956
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:49.030
<v Speaker 1>he was sober when he did my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about it and you know,</v>

2957
02:20:49.090 --> 02:20:54.090
<v Speaker 1>but then six months later he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrested for doing this and that and </v>

2958
02:20:54.090 --> 02:20:55.210
<v Speaker 1>getting crazy and doing drugs and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2959
02:20:55.211 --> 02:20:58.660
<v Speaker 1>he's just a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly troubled guy for a variety of</v>

2960
02:20:58.661 --> 02:21:00.820
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at his best,</v>

2961
02:21:00.880 --> 02:21:03.730
<v Speaker 1>one of the most brilliant comic actors </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

2962
02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:08.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it was fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So funny in that that show news radio </v>

2963
02:21:08.801 --> 02:21:12.160
<v Speaker 1>just really figured out how to utilize </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2964
02:21:12.370 --> 02:21:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Very much so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were very different people back </v>

2965
02:21:17.370 --> 02:21:17.370
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very different.</v>

2966
02:21:17.370 --> 02:21:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I was much younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupider,</v>

2967
02:21:17.801 --> 02:21:22.801
<v Speaker 1>angry or version of who I am now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I wasn't very tolerant of people </v>

2968
02:21:22.801 --> 02:21:24.130
<v Speaker 1>like Andy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier for me to snap at.</v>

2969
02:21:24.131 --> 02:21:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2970
02:21:25.001 --> 02:21:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2971
02:21:25.470 --> 02:21:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I would handle him much </v>
<v Speaker 1>different now if we ever did,</v>

2972
02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:30.580
<v Speaker 1>if we will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2973
02:21:30.581 --> 02:21:33.550
<v Speaker 1>if I was thrusted in that same situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my current personality.</v>

2974
02:21:33.551 --> 02:21:36.340
<v Speaker 1>But that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2975
02:21:36.430 --> 02:21:37.180
<v Speaker 1>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

2976
02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:40.270
<v Speaker 3>Is that show still on in syndication?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does that still.</v>

2977
02:21:40.350 --> 02:21:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just don't get money from it.</v>

2978
02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:44.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not much.</v>

2979
02:21:44.701 --> 02:21:48.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it was one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the initial payment,</v>

2980
02:21:48.781 --> 02:21:50.850
<v Speaker 1>you get a chunk and then it gets less </v>
<v Speaker 1>over time.</v>

2981
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.720
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things.</v>

2982
02:21:51.850 --> 02:21:53.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I reached out a little bit too,</v>

2983
02:21:53.511 --> 02:21:58.511
<v Speaker 3>Andy Dick last year because we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were trying to make a bunch of shows </v>

2984
02:21:58.511 --> 02:22:00.130
<v Speaker 3>that we'll all set in la since I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>living here.</v>

2985
02:22:00.131 --> 02:22:01.100
<v Speaker 3>The idea was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2986
02:22:01.101 --> 02:22:06.101
<v Speaker 3>let's do sort of La stories and one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them was going to be standup comedians </v>

2987
02:22:06.350 --> 02:22:11.350
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we were trying to find intriguing </v>

2988
02:22:11.350 --> 02:22:14.481
<v Speaker 3>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your guys who sort of represented </v>

2989
02:22:14.481 --> 02:22:15.130
<v Speaker 3>something about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't quite figure out what it was,</v>

2990
02:22:15.131 --> 02:22:18.850
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it was something to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the pressure on someone who's who's</v>

2991
02:22:18.851 --> 02:22:20.920
<v Speaker 3>their own producer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own writer,</v>

2992
02:22:20.930 --> 02:22:25.930
<v Speaker 3>their own performer and whose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whose performance is the performance of </v>

2993
02:22:25.930 --> 02:22:29.401
<v Speaker 3>themselves or a version of themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and that that entailed a certain </v>

2994
02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:33.171
<v Speaker 3>kind of vulnerability and a kind of high</v>
<v Speaker 3>stakes professional maneuver that you go</v>

2995
02:22:33.241 --> 02:22:38.241
<v Speaker 3>on stage and it's just you and a crowd </v>
<v Speaker 3>of people and whether you might face </v>

2996
02:22:38.241 --> 02:22:43.221
<v Speaker 3>heckling and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was how I formulated it in my </v>

2997
02:22:43.221 --> 02:22:46.671
<v Speaker 3>head and also that you might be </v>
<v Speaker 3>cannibalizing your own life to some </v>

2998
02:22:46.671 --> 02:22:49.911
<v Speaker 3>extent to a material and whether that </v>
<v Speaker 3>imposed a certain set of strains and </v>

2999
02:22:51.271 --> 02:22:56.271
<v Speaker 3>whether being funny itself came from </v>
<v Speaker 3>some angst or something in your </v>

3000
02:22:56.271 --> 02:22:56.271
<v Speaker 3>background.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

3001
02:22:56.271 --> 02:23:00.981
<v Speaker 3>so that was how I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was very hard for us to kind of </v>

3002
02:23:00.981 --> 02:23:01.800
<v Speaker 3>find the right people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's sort of.</v>

3003
02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:05.730
<v Speaker 3>We reached out to Andy and a few other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and he always said like,</v>

3004
02:23:05.731 --> 02:23:06.590
<v Speaker 3>I really want to film with you.</v>

3005
02:23:06.820 --> 02:23:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's perfect.</v>

3006
02:23:07.901 --> 02:23:09.640
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Light that out.</v>

3007
02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:14.940
<v Speaker 4>You can meet me after the show and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd never show up or we were just not </v>

3008
02:23:14.940 --> 02:23:18.691
<v Speaker 4>the best example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would want to get a guy that's </v>

3009
02:23:18.691 --> 02:23:18.820
<v Speaker 4>actually a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It actually does write a lot and perform</v>

3010
02:23:18.821 --> 02:23:23.821
<v Speaker 4>a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't build burger would be </v>

3011
02:23:23.821 --> 02:23:24.280
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Andy does his own material,</v>

3012
02:23:24.281 --> 02:23:26.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3013
02:23:26.561 --> 02:23:28.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

3014
02:23:28.001 --> 02:23:29.850
<v Speaker 4>you want to call it comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3015
02:23:29.890 --> 02:23:31.590
<v Speaker 4>That was the thing like it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

3016
02:23:31.690 --> 02:23:34.450
<v Speaker 4>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it actually comedy?</v>

3017
02:23:34.451 --> 02:23:36.400
<v Speaker 4>That's the mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny sometimes,</v>

3018
02:23:36.401 --> 02:23:41.401
<v Speaker 4>but it's also out there and kind of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>just sort of blurts well sometimes and </v>

3019
02:23:41.401 --> 02:23:43.360
<v Speaker 4>sometimes he prepares things and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3020
02:23:43.390 --> 02:23:45.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think he's a very,</v>

3021
02:23:45.430 --> 02:23:47.290
<v Speaker 4>what I'm trying to say without.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to dis him,</v>

3022
02:23:47.291 --> 02:23:52.291
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying that his style,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were on it to find a standup </v>

3023
02:23:52.291 --> 02:23:55.740
<v Speaker 4>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't necessarily categorize him </v>

3024
02:23:55.740 --> 02:23:58.621
<v Speaker 4>as a standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would categorize him as a performer </v>

3025
02:23:58.621 --> 02:23:58.621
<v Speaker 4>who occasionally works in standup comedy</v>
<v Speaker 4>clubs.</v>

3026
02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:01.960
<v Speaker 3>So that's a good way of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of looking at it.</v>

3027
02:24:01.961 --> 02:24:03.970
<v Speaker 3>And that may have been one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

3028
02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:09.280
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our sort of a keenness to eagerness </v>

3029
02:24:09.280 --> 02:24:13.651
<v Speaker 3>to get intriguing people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w we perhaps stretched the categories a </v>

3030
02:24:13.651 --> 02:24:16.510
<v Speaker 3>bit in a way that wasn't helpful and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that may have been a clue that it wasn't</v>

3031
02:24:16.511 --> 02:24:21.511
<v Speaker 3>quite the right story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or do you think there is a good </v>

3032
02:24:21.511 --> 02:24:22.450
<v Speaker 3>documentary to be made?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like when I was doing it,</v>

3033
02:24:22.451 --> 02:24:24.670
<v Speaker 3>it felt like the world was not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dis,</v>

3034
02:24:24.730 --> 02:24:27.100
<v Speaker 3>was too close to my own world in an odd </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3035
02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:32.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's certainly something to </v>

3036
02:24:32.380 --> 02:24:33.740
<v Speaker 4>describing standup comedy mean it's sort</v>
<v Speaker 4>of kind of has been done in a way,</v>

3037
02:24:34.460 --> 02:24:39.110
<v Speaker 4>in some ways I guess has it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am comic.</v>

3038
02:24:39.111 --> 02:24:44.111
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I watched them all now they didn't get </v>

3039
02:24:44.111 --> 02:24:44.111
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3040
02:24:44.111 --> 02:24:44.930
<v Speaker 4>they're all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've all got their moments,</v>

3041
02:24:44.931 --> 02:24:46.580
<v Speaker 4>but it's almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3042
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:48.920
<v Speaker 4>what about Jerry Seinfeld's documented </v>
<v Speaker 4>that best one?</v>

3043
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:50.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was a really good one.</v>

3044
02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:54.890
<v Speaker 4>He was really open about the creative </v>
<v Speaker 4>process showed well,</v>

3045
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:58.940
<v Speaker 4>I think one was kind of used there to </v>
<v Speaker 4>make Jerry look a lot more likable.</v>

3046
02:24:59.510 --> 02:25:04.510
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why they chose Origami </v>

3047
02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:04.510
<v Speaker 4>in the middle of like his struggle and </v>
<v Speaker 4>angst.</v>

3048
02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:05.200
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

3049
02:25:05.210 --> 02:25:07.430
<v Speaker 4>I know very little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very little,</v>

3050
02:25:07.650 --> 02:25:10.700
<v Speaker 4>you know him from that and I've had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>few,</v>

3051
02:25:10.701 --> 02:25:12.950
<v Speaker 4>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you doing in real life?</v>

3052
02:25:12.951 --> 02:25:15.980
<v Speaker 4>But I almost felt like he was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>thrust into that situation.</v>

3053
02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:21.050
<v Speaker 4>He seems like quite troubled in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary and it's almost like they're</v>

3054
02:25:21.051 --> 02:25:22.880
<v Speaker 4>putting them in there to make Jerry </v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3055
02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:25.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in comparison to,</v>

3056
02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:26.530
<v Speaker 4>to Jerry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3057
02:25:26.531 --> 02:25:29.280
<v Speaker 4>he's fucking crazy and it makes Gerry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Luke,</v>

3058
02:25:29.281 --> 02:25:31.300
<v Speaker 4>luke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this really likable,</v>

3059
02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:34.010
<v Speaker 4>affable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of together do right.</v>

3060
02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:36.400
<v Speaker 4>Well not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that I don't think Jerry is,</v>

3061
02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:39.430
<v Speaker 4>but I think I just found it weird that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they would choose that guy.</v>

3062
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:44.790
<v Speaker 4>Like why would they choose that guy out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of all the comedians in New York City </v>

3063
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:48.300
<v Speaker 4>who was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he liked a certain level of self </v>

3064
02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:48.300
<v Speaker 4>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3065
02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:50.050
<v Speaker 4>Which I think made him a spectacle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3066
02:25:50.051 --> 02:25:52.150
<v Speaker 4>A spectacles and excellent way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting it.</v>

3067
02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:53.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3068
02:25:53.231 --> 02:25:54.580
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3069
02:25:54.581 --> 02:25:58.110
<v Speaker 4>he's fucked in that documentary least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3070
02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:00.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just,</v>

3071
02:26:00.700 --> 02:26:02.320
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy is a tricky thing,</v>

3072
02:26:02.321 --> 02:26:03.250
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3073
02:26:03.490 --> 02:26:06.940
<v Speaker 4>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very bizarre art form where you,</v>

3074
02:26:07.870 --> 02:26:10.090
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different types of </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy.</v>

3075
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:12.520
<v Speaker 4>There's so many different styles of </v>
<v Speaker 4>comedy,</v>

3076
02:26:12.521 --> 02:26:17.521
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different ways you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>go about it and you're the only one who </v>

3077
02:26:17.521 --> 02:26:18.160
<v Speaker 4>really knows your best way and you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>to find it.</v>

3078
02:26:18.161 --> 02:26:19.990
<v Speaker 4>And the only way you find it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in front of an audience,</v>

3079
02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:23.920
<v Speaker 4>one of the few art forms that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>require other people's input.</v>

3080
02:26:24.430 --> 02:26:27.940
<v Speaker 4>You require them to be there while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're creating it.</v>

3081
02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:32.530
<v Speaker 4>You write on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I write all my stuff on either I write,</v>

3082
02:26:32.680 --> 02:26:37.680
<v Speaker 4>either I have an idea and I write down </v>
<v Speaker 4>notes or actually physically sit in </v>

3083
02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:41.491
<v Speaker 4>front of the keyboard and I write long </v>
<v Speaker 4>form and then cherry pick ideas out of </v>

3084
02:26:41.491 --> 02:26:43.520
<v Speaker 4>those long forms and introduce it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they don't.</v>

3085
02:26:43.570 --> 02:26:46.240
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't really come alive unless you </v>
<v Speaker 4>do it in front of an audience.</v>

3086
02:26:46.270 --> 02:26:51.270
<v Speaker 4>If I approached you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we did because I'd </v>

3087
02:26:51.270 --> 02:26:51.730
<v Speaker 4>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I had approached you to be in the</v>

3088
02:26:51.731 --> 02:26:52.600
<v Speaker 4>documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3089
02:26:52.680 --> 02:26:54.400
<v Speaker 4>what would've been your thought process?</v>

3090
02:26:54.730 --> 02:26:57.700
<v Speaker 4>That it would probably be intrusive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That didn't really.</v>

3091
02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:02.820
<v Speaker 4>I probably wouldn't be interested.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be the plus side of it wouldn't,</v>

3092
02:27:04.410 --> 02:27:09.410
<v Speaker 4>it would seem like I would have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to all this and there's </v>

3093
02:27:09.410 --> 02:27:13.741
<v Speaker 4>something about observing something and </v>
<v Speaker 4>filming something and recording </v>

3094
02:27:13.741 --> 02:27:15.580
<v Speaker 4>something which changes the nature of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing itself.</v>

3095
02:27:16.030 --> 02:27:17.140
<v Speaker 4>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3096
02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:22.170
<v Speaker 4>in standup comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's really important to me when I'm </v>

3097
02:27:22.170 --> 02:27:24.811
<v Speaker 4>creating it especially is just getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>it right is like working on it and </v>

3098
02:27:24.811 --> 02:27:29.461
<v Speaker 4>getting it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't want cameras there and </v>

3099
02:27:29.461 --> 02:27:31.240
<v Speaker 4>observing the whole process of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I would have to think about that as</v>

3100
02:27:31.241 --> 02:27:33.160
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And where do you write when you write?</v>

3101
02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:35.320
<v Speaker 4>I write at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if it's on the road,</v>

3102
02:27:36.310 --> 02:27:38.080
<v Speaker 4>which I know it sounds like we're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to,</v>

3103
02:27:38.081 --> 02:27:40.390
<v Speaker 4>but if I was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

3104
02:27:40.391 --> 02:27:41.920
<v Speaker 4>where do you write this is your room?</v>

3105
02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:45.040
<v Speaker 4>Can we see a notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a re read?</v>

3106
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:47.230
<v Speaker 4>Can you read out some of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't do that.</v>

3107
02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:52.620
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just sort of tell you about what my </v>

3108
02:27:52.620 --> 02:27:55.591
<v Speaker 4>processes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I wouldn't want and I don't even </v>

3109
02:27:55.591 --> 02:27:59.371
<v Speaker 4>like people like filming things at my </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows and I'm working on shit because I </v>

3110
02:27:59.371 --> 02:28:00.670
<v Speaker 4>don't want to getting on Youtube or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3111
02:28:00.671 --> 02:28:02.110
<v Speaker 4>It's not done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3112
02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:04.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a sketch and then if,</v>

3113
02:28:04.610 --> 02:28:08.770
<v Speaker 4>if that gets on youtube and then someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>sees it like three months later and it's</v>

3114
02:28:08.771 --> 02:28:11.350
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they still know where it's going.</v>

3115
02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:14.440
<v Speaker 4>Like part of comedy is you want new </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3116
02:28:14.800 --> 02:28:17.200
<v Speaker 4>When you go to see a band,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go to see the rolling stones.</v>

3117
02:28:17.201 --> 02:28:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to hear new rollingstone </v>
<v Speaker 4>songs?</v>

3118
02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:21.400
<v Speaker 4>Fuck No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to hear the classics?</v>

3119
02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:24.860
<v Speaker 4>You want to hear sympathy for the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to hear satisfaction.</v>

3120
02:28:24.861 --> 02:28:27.770
<v Speaker 4>You want to hear the songs you already </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that you can relate to.</v>

3121
02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:31.190
<v Speaker 4>Comedy is the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want to always hear new stuff.</v>

3122
02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:36.460
<v Speaker 4>Like I have a standup comedy special </v>
<v Speaker 4>that premiered on comedy central Friday </v>

3123
02:28:36.460 --> 02:28:38.750
<v Speaker 4>night and one of the points that I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>made in advertising,</v>

3124
02:28:38.751 --> 02:28:42.830
<v Speaker 4>all these current shows that I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>is it's all new material.</v>

3125
02:28:42.860 --> 02:28:47.860
<v Speaker 4>Like if you saw the thing from Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 4>to Saturday night or Friday night that </v>

3126
02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:48.770
<v Speaker 4>aired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go see me live next week,</v>

3127
02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:50.330
<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna see any of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>material.</v>

3128
02:28:50.331 --> 02:28:51.890
<v Speaker 4>The materials done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's gone,</v>

3129
02:28:52.010 --> 02:28:54.050
<v Speaker 4>throw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's filmed,</v>

3130
02:28:54.051 --> 02:28:59.051
<v Speaker 4>it's out there and the Internet and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ether and comedy central and it's there </v>

3131
02:28:59.051 --> 02:29:00.920
<v Speaker 4>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what I do on stage now,</v>

3132
02:29:00.930 --> 02:29:01.850
<v Speaker 4>Amanda,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new stuff.</v>

3133
02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:07.030
<v Speaker 4>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want my process to be a part of </v>

3134
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:09.860
<v Speaker 4>what's like record because it's not done</v>
<v Speaker 4>like get it,</v>

3135
02:29:09.980 --> 02:29:14.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's why we didn't do it in the </v>

3136
02:29:14.980 --> 02:29:15.410
<v Speaker 4>end because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a very understandable reaction.</v>

3137
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:16.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't see,</v>

3138
02:29:16.281 --> 02:29:21.281
<v Speaker 4>we would have got that across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think you could describe the </v>

3139
02:29:21.281 --> 02:29:21.620
<v Speaker 4>process of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would describe it,</v>

3140
02:29:21.621 --> 02:29:23.170
<v Speaker 4>but it's boring.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>

3141
02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:24.980
<v Speaker 4>that's not a TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not something I could,</v>

3142
02:29:25.010 --> 02:29:27.430
<v Speaker 4>I could document and know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then.</v>

3143
02:29:27.770 --> 02:29:31.520
<v Speaker 4>So we figured it's too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why?</v>

3144
02:29:31.521 --> 02:29:33.740
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes away from the finished product.</v>

3145
02:29:33.760 --> 02:29:38.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you know the whole process </v>

3146
02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:38.760
<v Speaker 4>behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3147
02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:41.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for someone who's like a comedy nerd or </v>

3148
02:29:41.930 --> 02:29:42.260
<v Speaker 4>a Dork or.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I say that in all loving terms,</v>

3149
02:29:42.261 --> 02:29:47.261
<v Speaker 4>like there's comedy nerds that like come</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like dozens and dozens and dozens of </v>

3150
02:29:47.261 --> 02:29:50.390
<v Speaker 4>shows every month and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll have seen me three or four times</v>

3151
02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:53.600
<v Speaker 4>in a period of three or four months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had people come up to me and say,</v>

3152
02:29:53.601 --> 02:29:58.601
<v Speaker 4>I love watching the material grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's amazing watching you add </v>

3153
02:29:58.601 --> 02:29:59.690
<v Speaker 4>new bits to it or come up with new </v>
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

3154
02:29:59.690 --> 02:30:04.690
<v Speaker 4>And I'm always uncomfortable about that </v>
<v Speaker 4>because then the last thing you want to </v>

3155
02:30:04.690 --> 02:30:08.591
<v Speaker 4>do is see someone in the front row two </v>
<v Speaker 4>nights in a row like that happens.</v>

3156
02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:13.780
<v Speaker 4>Like you'll see someone like you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Portland for the weekend and you see </v>

3157
02:30:13.780 --> 02:30:15.710
<v Speaker 4>a person in the front row Friday and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then their Saturday to you like,</v>

3158
02:30:15.711 --> 02:30:18.540
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy knows all my fucking jokes that</v>

3159
02:30:18.541 --> 02:30:23.541
<v Speaker 4>you know they know all the set.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you feel artificial when you're </v>

3160
02:30:23.541 --> 02:30:26.771
<v Speaker 4>setting up the bits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You would like people to see your bits </v>

3161
02:30:26.771 --> 02:30:30.110
<v Speaker 4>when there is close to done as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When there close to the finished form as</v>

3162
02:30:30.111 --> 02:30:31.850
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That way you're going to get.</v>

3163
02:30:31.851 --> 02:30:35.360
<v Speaker 4>They're going to get the best show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have the best economy of words,</v>

3164
02:30:35.361 --> 02:30:37.730
<v Speaker 4>you have the best manipulation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>language,</v>

3165
02:30:37.731 --> 02:30:41.270
<v Speaker 4>the best setup segues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff has been fleshed out.</v>

3166
02:30:41.271 --> 02:30:44.300
<v Speaker 4>It's been worked out on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>countless hours,</v>

3167
02:30:44.450 --> 02:30:47.270
<v Speaker 4>examining notes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to recordings,</v>

3168
02:30:47.271 --> 02:30:48.140
<v Speaker 4>and then performing.</v>

3169
02:30:48.260 --> 02:30:53.260
<v Speaker 4>That's what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want people to get the show at its </v>

3170
02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:53.260
<v Speaker 4>best,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3171
02:30:53.260 --> 02:30:57.810
<v Speaker 4>and which is why when someone releases a</v>
<v Speaker 4>special like right after the release of </v>

3172
02:30:57.810 --> 02:31:01.481
<v Speaker 4>special,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's oftentimes not the best time to go </v>

3173
02:31:01.481 --> 02:31:03.431
<v Speaker 4>see them because the material is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking scattered and they're trying to </v>

3174
02:31:03.431 --> 02:31:06.491
<v Speaker 4>put it all together and then you see the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same person six months later and it's </v>

3175
02:31:06.491 --> 02:31:07.190
<v Speaker 4>just fucking just boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

3176
02:31:07.191 --> 02:31:08.540
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all comes together,</v>

3177
02:31:09.190 --> 02:31:14.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's a long sort of a brutal process </v>

3178
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:14.430
<v Speaker 4>but exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3179
02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:18.950
<v Speaker 4>it's challenging and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's got a lot of downs to it,</v>

3180
02:31:19.290 --> 02:31:21.360
<v Speaker 4>but the ops are awesome when it's done</v>

3181
02:31:23.890 --> 02:31:24.520
<v Speaker 10>in a nutshell,</v>

3182
02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.780
<v Speaker 4>I feel like we've made the documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was great.</v>

3183
02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:30.540
<v Speaker 4>I want to talk to you about scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3184
02:31:30.690 --> 02:31:35.690
<v Speaker 4>What is the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the issue that you're having in trying </v>

3185
02:31:35.690 --> 02:31:39.141
<v Speaker 4>to pursue this and what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what exactly is the reaction to people </v>

3186
02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:46.820
<v Speaker 4>in the scientology community now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it seems like the Internet has </v>

3187
02:31:46.820 --> 02:31:50.370
<v Speaker 4>sort of exposed that religion in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that it before it was always like,</v>

3188
02:31:50.371 --> 02:31:52.350
<v Speaker 4>what scientology me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>

3189
02:31:52.620 --> 02:31:57.620
<v Speaker 4>But now the internet is sort of all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tom cruise recruitment videos have been </v>

3190
02:31:57.620 --> 02:32:01.401
<v Speaker 4>released and all the craziness is out </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the people like that have wrote </v>

3191
02:32:01.401 --> 02:32:03.510
<v Speaker 4>going clear that book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading that right now.</v>

3192
02:32:04.080 --> 02:32:05.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm Lawrence Wright's book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3193
02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:11.120
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole religion would call it a </v>

3194
02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:11.520
<v Speaker 4>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where the fuck it is.</v>

3195
02:32:11.521 --> 02:32:15.720
<v Speaker 4>The whole movement seems to be in a very</v>
<v Speaker 4>state of flux right now.</v>

3196
02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:19.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably true at the same</v>

3197
02:32:19.861 --> 02:32:20.790
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for the,</v>

3198
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:23.490
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for students of a,</v>

3199
02:32:24.780 --> 02:32:27.930
<v Speaker 3>I guess religious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a oddity or,</v>

3200
02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:28.750
<v Speaker 3>or,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3201
02:32:28.830 --> 02:32:31.560
<v Speaker 3>new religions or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call it,</v>

3202
02:32:31.561 --> 02:32:36.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's known and it's out there in your </v>

3203
02:32:36.561 --> 02:32:36.561
<v Speaker 3>reading Lawrence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3204
02:32:36.561 --> 02:32:36.561
<v Speaker 3>I read that Lawrence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3205
02:32:36.561 --> 02:32:37.390
<v Speaker 3>But there's a vast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3206
02:32:37.460 --> 02:32:42.460
<v Speaker 3>there's a vast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive kind of main street people for </v>

3207
02:32:42.460 --> 02:32:44.631
<v Speaker 3>whom they still all they know is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's that thing that Tom Cruise is </v>

3208
02:32:44.631 --> 02:32:44.631
<v Speaker 3>involved in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of weird,</v>

3209
02:32:44.631 --> 02:32:46.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they.</v>

3210
02:32:46.310 --> 02:32:48.480
<v Speaker 3>And so they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think there's a huge.</v>

3211
02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:50.580
<v Speaker 3>So I think step one for a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like,</v>

3212
02:32:50.581 --> 02:32:51.420
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3213
02:32:51.430 --> 02:32:56.430
<v Speaker 3>it's something to do with Ufo shows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Cruise and John Travolta and maybe </v>

3214
02:32:56.430 --> 02:32:58.260
<v Speaker 3>his sexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but beyond that,</v>

3215
02:32:58.261 --> 02:32:58.930
<v Speaker 3>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

3216
02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:03.420
<v Speaker 3>so part of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is trying to convey what it actually is.</v>

3217
02:33:03.420 --> 02:33:06.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been studying in the area for,</v>

3218
02:33:06.590 --> 02:33:09.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like reading all the books for about 15,</v>

3219
02:33:09.001 --> 02:33:14.001
<v Speaker 3>20 years before Lawrence Wright's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was one by Janet reitman called </v>

3220
02:33:14.001 --> 02:33:18.111
<v Speaker 3>inside scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole laundry list of books </v>

3221
02:33:18.111 --> 02:33:20.571
<v Speaker 3>about scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still don't quite get what it is to </v>

3222
02:33:20.571 --> 02:33:20.571
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3223
02:33:21.090 --> 02:33:23.100
<v Speaker 3>I do in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

3224
02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:25.110
<v Speaker 3>what's it called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unquestionably.</v>

3225
02:33:25.140 --> 02:33:27.360
<v Speaker 3>But they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

3226
02:33:27.570 --> 02:33:29.010
<v Speaker 3>But it was created by a science fiction </v>
<v Speaker 3>writer.</v>

3227
02:33:29.040 --> 02:33:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But say,</v>

3228
02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:33.090
<v Speaker 3>say that's true still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's lots of cults out there.</v>

3229
02:33:33.700 --> 02:33:34.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3230
02:33:34.891 --> 02:33:35.340
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beyond that,</v>

3231
02:33:35.341 --> 02:33:36.270
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they,</v>

3232
02:33:36.420 --> 02:33:39.870
<v Speaker 3>how do they practice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they practice?</v>

3233
02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Meaning what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what do they like?</v>

3234
02:33:41.581 --> 02:33:44.160
<v Speaker 3>We know with Catholics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go to church,</v>

3235
02:33:44.370 --> 02:33:47.450
<v Speaker 3>they kept confession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat crackers and,</v>

3236
02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:49.600
<v Speaker 3>and it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the body of,</v>

3237
02:33:49.850 --> 02:33:50.230
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

3238
02:33:50.231 --> 02:33:54.660
<v Speaker 3>of Jesus Christ rise and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3239
02:33:54.661 --> 02:33:56.400
<v Speaker 3>and they believe in the pope and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3240
02:33:56.401 --> 02:34:00.450
<v Speaker 3>we know roughly what their sacrament is </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they read the Bible and they believe</v>

3241
02:34:00.451 --> 02:34:01.760
<v Speaker 3>in Jesus and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so and so.</v>

3242
02:34:01.830 --> 02:34:03.930
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what is it with scientology?</v>

3243
02:34:04.400 --> 02:34:06.530
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good question.</v>

3244
02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:08.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3245
02:34:08.210 --> 02:34:10.920
<v Speaker 4>like if they have ceremonies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they,</v>

3246
02:34:10.990 --> 02:34:13.940
<v Speaker 4>I think when you look at that Tom cruise</v>
<v Speaker 4>recruitment video,</v>

3247
02:34:13.941 --> 02:34:16.280
<v Speaker 4>which is fucking fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3248
02:34:16.281 --> 02:34:18.030
<v Speaker 4>when he's standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've</v>

3249
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:19.480
<v Speaker 1>seen the one where they give them a </v>
<v Speaker 1>metal.</v>

3250
02:34:19.620 --> 02:34:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fucking,</v>

3251
02:34:21.370 --> 02:34:23.830
<v Speaker 1>just so rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a giant metal,</v>

3252
02:34:23.831 --> 02:34:26.410
<v Speaker 1>many times larger than an Olympic gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>medal.</v>

3253
02:34:26.411 --> 02:34:27.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3254
02:34:27.550 --> 02:34:30.520
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing this metal and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>standing there in front of a fucking.</v>

3255
02:34:30.550 --> 02:34:32.370
<v Speaker 1>It's called the freedom middle of valor.</v>

3256
02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:36.020
<v Speaker 11>Hm.</v>

3257
02:34:38.450 --> 02:34:43.450
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's standing in front of all those </v>

3258
02:34:43.450 --> 02:34:43.790
<v Speaker 1>people and he's such a charismatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

3259
02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:45.110
<v Speaker 1>There it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3260
02:34:45.111 --> 02:34:48.890
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Louisa's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at that fucking thing.</v>

3261
02:34:49.460 --> 02:34:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the,</v>

3262
02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:56.320
<v Speaker 1>the lack of like understanding how you </v>
<v Speaker 1>come across that would allow you to wear</v>

3263
02:34:59.271 --> 02:35:04.271
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lack of objectivity that it will </v>

3264
02:35:04.271 --> 02:35:04.271
<v Speaker 1>allow you to put that on and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3265
02:35:04.271 --> 02:35:08.060
<v Speaker 1>and be able to do this fingertips down </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing on the,</v>

3266
02:35:08.061 --> 02:35:09.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the desk.</v>

3267
02:35:09.741 --> 02:35:14.741
<v Speaker 1>Like you're making a very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>point while you're wearing a fucking </v>

3268
02:35:14.741 --> 02:35:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Frisbee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gold frisbee around your neck.</v>

3269
02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:22.840
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like he's trying to convince</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself by tricking all these people.</v>

3270
02:35:23.930 --> 02:35:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something to,</v>

3271
02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:32.680
<v Speaker 1>if you can get a thousand people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheer at these words that you're saying </v>

3272
02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:37.460
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how fucking crazy they are,</v>

3273
02:35:37.640 --> 02:35:41.360
<v Speaker 1>if you can get all these people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe you and listen to you,</v>

3274
02:35:41.361 --> 02:35:45.350
<v Speaker 1>it sort of validates that maybe you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not fucked up because you're in with all</v>

3275
02:35:45.351 --> 02:35:48.320
<v Speaker 1>these other people that have agreed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fetuses and fucking,</v>

3276
02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:54.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the other wacky shit that they </v>

3277
02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:56.711
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something to that where he's </v>

3278
02:35:56.711 --> 02:36:00.221
<v Speaker 1>putting on this massive performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for them but for himself as </v>

3279
02:36:00.221 --> 02:36:00.260
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3280
02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:04.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me it,</v>

3281
02:36:04.010 --> 02:36:05.780
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a bit like the Oscars,</v>

3282
02:36:05.781 --> 02:36:08.030
<v Speaker 3>like that's when I was watching the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Oscars last night.</v>

3283
02:36:08.031 --> 02:36:08.480
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3284
02:36:08.481 --> 02:36:10.670
<v Speaker 3>it's like a scientology event,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3285
02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:12.050
<v Speaker 3>it's that level of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3286
02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:13.770
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the,</v>

3287
02:36:13.950 --> 02:36:18.410
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the performance or the or the light.</v>

3288
02:36:18.411 --> 02:36:20.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the semiotics of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3289
02:36:20.181 --> 02:36:24.380
<v Speaker 3>the signifier they're trying to send a </v>
<v Speaker 3>message of grand,</v>

3290
02:36:24.440 --> 02:36:26.920
<v Speaker 3>big golden.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3291
02:36:27.200 --> 02:36:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3292
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:30.860
<v Speaker 3>like both Oscars and the freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3293
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:35.870
<v Speaker 3>he's wearing around his neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like is it any more silly than </v>

3294
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.870
<v Speaker 3>having a little gold man?</v>

3295
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:40.280
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Greg Fitzsimmons put posted </v>

3296
02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:40.380
<v Speaker 1>something on twitter and I retweeted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

3297
02:36:40.381 --> 02:36:45.381
<v Speaker 1>I hope the Oscars get beamed to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops so they could see all the people </v>

3298
02:36:45.381 --> 02:36:47.400
<v Speaker 1>get rewarded for brave and courageous </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

3299
02:36:47.401 --> 02:36:52.401
<v Speaker 1>This year was such a great tweet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know,</v>

3300
02:36:54.211 --> 02:36:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Greg is a brilliant comedian himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's such a great tweet because it's</v>

3301
02:36:58.921 --> 02:37:03.921
<v Speaker 1>so fucking right on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so pompous and self rewarding and </v>

3302
02:37:04.771 --> 02:37:09.771
<v Speaker 1>self aggrandizing and so ridiculous or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing suits with fucking special ties </v>

3303
02:37:10.801 --> 02:37:14.170
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a formal attire and it's</v>

3304
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:15.950
<v Speaker 3>it and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3305
02:37:15.951 --> 02:37:16.190
<v Speaker 3>not</v>

3306
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:19.980
<v Speaker 4>to say they shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean but,</v>

3307
02:37:20.530 --> 02:37:21.000
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3308
02:37:21.010 --> 02:37:26.010
<v Speaker 4>but my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my point is though is that so like with </v>

3309
02:37:26.010 --> 02:37:26.390
<v Speaker 4>Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3310
02:37:26.391 --> 02:37:28.940
<v Speaker 4>He's got his fingers down but in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>end,</v>

3311
02:37:29.390 --> 02:37:34.210
<v Speaker 4>so why pick on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on TC and scientology but,</v>

3312
02:37:34.840 --> 02:37:38.360
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're letting the Oscars know.</v>

3313
02:37:38.580 --> 02:37:43.580
<v Speaker 4>We'll say that we'll give that a pass </v>
<v Speaker 4>but we can't have guys wearing golden </v>

3314
02:37:43.580 --> 02:37:46.190
<v Speaker 4>little golden ones around their neck </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they have to be little men.</v>

3315
02:37:46.220 --> 02:37:47.250
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh sure.</v>

3316
02:37:47.251 --> 02:37:49.370
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also why is it okay?</v>

3317
02:37:49.530 --> 02:37:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Why is it okay to pick on Tom Cruise?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's not okay to pick on Jewish </v>

3318
02:37:54.530 --> 02:37:57.270
<v Speaker 4>people with curls and there bobbing up </v>
<v Speaker 4>and down.</v>

3319
02:37:57.271 --> 02:37:59.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's their religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's their,</v>

3320
02:37:59.930 --> 02:38:04.930
<v Speaker 4>their traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is just a tradition where it's not </v>

3321
02:38:04.930 --> 02:38:05.730
<v Speaker 4>a real religion in our eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know the guy who wrote it.</v>

3322
02:38:06.210 --> 02:38:07.230
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good point.</v>

3323
02:38:07.231 --> 02:38:08.610
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that people have</v>

3324
02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:14.160
<v Speaker 3>part of I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think what I would try and do in </v>

3325
02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:17.680
<v Speaker 3>making a documentary about is to try and</v>
<v Speaker 3>see past a lot of the things that people</v>

3326
02:38:17.681 --> 02:38:20.530
<v Speaker 3>find weird or ludicrous about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3327
02:38:20.531 --> 02:38:21.940
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3328
02:38:21.941 --> 02:38:26.941
<v Speaker 3>the fact that they have big glitzy </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientology events and get to the core </v>

3329
02:38:26.941 --> 02:38:27.190
<v Speaker 3>of what it is.</v>

3330
02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Well it is craziness is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is nothing.</v>

3331
02:38:30.341 --> 02:38:35.341
<v Speaker 4>You can't get to the core of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The core of it is established sort of </v>

3332
02:38:35.341 --> 02:38:39.960
<v Speaker 4>pattern of thoughts that allow people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who are not normal to feel normal,</v>

3333
02:38:40.990 --> 02:38:44.470
<v Speaker 4>allow people that are troubled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>allow people that are searching for some</v>

3334
02:38:44.471 --> 02:38:46.660
<v Speaker 4>sort of a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>TC is normal.</v>

3335
02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:48.930
<v Speaker 4>I do not think he's doing based on what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3336
02:38:48.940 --> 02:38:51.190
<v Speaker 4>based on the fact that he's so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>famous.</v>

3337
02:38:51.191 --> 02:38:54.370
<v Speaker 4>It's impossible to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was in it before he was famous.</v>

3338
02:38:54.610 --> 02:38:55.930
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

3339
02:38:56.050 --> 02:38:58.630
<v Speaker 4>and it helps the company know about </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3340
02:38:58.631 --> 02:39:01.360
<v Speaker 4>I believe he got in at when he was still</v>
<v Speaker 4>running</v>

3341
02:39:01.390 --> 02:39:05.200
<v Speaker 3>pretty early on and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think jt got in it,</v>

3342
02:39:05.340 --> 02:39:09.870
<v Speaker 4>Shane in the Carter years maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3343
02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:14.960
<v Speaker 4>but very early.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's also the ambiguous sexuality </v>

3344
02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:15.360
<v Speaker 4>aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's the,</v>

3345
02:39:15.390 --> 02:39:20.390
<v Speaker 4>the rumors of homosexuality that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>attached to a famous male scientologists</v>

3346
02:39:22.220 --> 02:39:24.270
<v Speaker 4>that they shield them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3347
02:39:24.271 --> 02:39:25.470
<v Speaker 4>and especially the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3348
02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:30.480
<v Speaker 4>the John Travolta thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you got to get out of here pretty </v>

3349
02:39:30.480 --> 02:39:30.570
<v Speaker 4>soon where it's almost 3:00.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're almost wrapped up anyway.</v>

3350
02:39:31.070 --> 02:39:36.070
<v Speaker 4>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of weirdness going on and </v>

3351
02:39:36.070 --> 02:39:39.471
<v Speaker 4>there's also the people that have you </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked to people that have done </v>

3352
02:39:39.471 --> 02:39:42.180
<v Speaker 4>expositions on scientology and what they</v>
<v Speaker 4>say is that during the auditing process,</v>

3353
02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:47.420
<v Speaker 4>when they audit you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning when you go over past life </v>

3354
02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:50.991
<v Speaker 4>experiences that are quite troubling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You repeat them over and over again </v>

3355
02:39:50.991 --> 02:39:54.081
<v Speaker 4>until they lose their meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the same thing as like if you say </v>

3356
02:39:54.081 --> 02:39:54.150
<v Speaker 4>fuck around someone who never says fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3357
02:39:54.151 --> 02:39:56.880
<v Speaker 4>like Oh say fuck around a priest or you </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3358
02:39:56.881 --> 02:39:58.830
<v Speaker 4>act like it's some horrible thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've done.</v>

3359
02:39:58.980 --> 02:40:01.140
<v Speaker 4>We say fuck around your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't even,</v>

3360
02:40:01.141 --> 02:40:02.970
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't even register.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3361
02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:03.960
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this fucking thing.</v>

3362
02:40:03.961 --> 02:40:05.730
<v Speaker 4>It's another word.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

3363
02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:09.240
<v Speaker 4>it has no power because it's so used so </v>
<v Speaker 4>much,</v>

3364
02:40:09.450 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 4>and I think maybe that's a bad analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in a sense it works because what</v>

3365
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.970
<v Speaker 1>they're doing is repeating the stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over and over and over</v>

3366
02:40:17.971 --> 02:40:19.950
<v Speaker 1>again until they lose their meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the process,</v>

3367
02:40:19.951 --> 02:40:23.250
<v Speaker 1>they're recording all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have all this dirt on you.</v>

3368
02:40:23.460 --> 02:40:28.460
<v Speaker 1>They have all these crazy stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going through the process </v>

3369
02:40:28.460 --> 02:40:31.880
<v Speaker 1>earnestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're telling them all the secrets of </v>

3370
02:40:31.880 --> 02:40:32.220
<v Speaker 1>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the crazy gay orgies,</v>

3371
02:40:32.221 --> 02:40:33.590
<v Speaker 1>you'd been a part of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3372
02:40:33.620 --> 02:40:36.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nutty fucking cocaine binges,</v>

3373
02:40:36.361 --> 02:40:39.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you've done that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're ashamed of</v>

3374
02:40:39.850 --> 02:40:41.160
<v Speaker 3>and you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3375
02:40:41.190 --> 02:40:44.800
<v Speaker 3>Does that get released?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The point you decide to leave?</v>

3376
02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:45.370
<v Speaker 3>You think</v>

3377
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:47.240
<v Speaker 1>it's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3378
02:40:47.270 --> 02:40:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know</v>

3379
02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:48.700
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

3380
02:40:48.701 --> 02:40:49.420
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3381
02:40:49.590 --> 02:40:51.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are adamant that,</v>

3382
02:40:52.090 --> 02:40:57.090
<v Speaker 3>that is held under a priest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>penitent bond of confidentiality.</v>

3383
02:40:57.460 --> 02:40:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Of course they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean the,</v>

3384
02:40:59.610 --> 02:41:01.840
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the mother of all rumors?</v>

3385
02:41:02.410 --> 02:41:05.170
<v Speaker 1>The greatest rumor of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3386
02:41:05.171 --> 02:41:06.610
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Gere.</v>

3387
02:41:06.730 --> 02:41:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Do you know when that rumor was </v>
<v Speaker 1>released?</v>

3388
02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3389
02:41:09.940 --> 02:41:13.040
<v Speaker 1>when Richard Gere left scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know he was in scientology.</v>

3390
02:41:13.130 --> 02:41:14.390
<v Speaker 1>He dabbled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>

3391
02:41:14.540 --> 02:41:15.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you serious?</v>

3392
02:41:15.711 --> 02:41:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He dabbled in scientology and that,</v>

3393
02:41:18.111 --> 02:41:23.111
<v Speaker 1>that rumor was released when the Tom </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cruise or the John Travolta massage </v>

3394
02:41:23.900 --> 02:41:28.900
<v Speaker 1>therapy stories were released.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly that's when John Travolta was </v>

3395
02:41:30.891 --> 02:41:35.270
<v Speaker 1>having issues with scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So way to keep you under wraps.</v>

3396
02:41:35.330 --> 02:41:38.000
<v Speaker 1>This is the rumors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously completely unsubstantiated.</v>

3397
02:41:38.180 --> 02:41:43.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking out of my ass 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that makes sense,</v>

3398
02:41:43.021 --> 02:41:44.710
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>

3399
02:41:44.740 --> 02:41:49.740
<v Speaker 1>if you have a powerful organization that</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a certain percentage of the amount </v>

3400
02:41:49.740 --> 02:41:52.710
<v Speaker 1>of money that you make every year and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of crazy shit on you,</v>

3401
02:41:53.070 --> 02:41:56.260
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to go and get massages and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk these guys into Latin.</v>

3402
02:41:56.340 --> 02:42:01.340
<v Speaker 1>You fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that would think that would be </v>

3403
02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:01.340
<v Speaker 1>something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3404
02:42:01.340 --> 02:42:03.750
<v Speaker 1>maybe if you were going to leave and </v>
<v Speaker 1>take all that money away,</v>

3405
02:42:03.780 --> 02:42:04.710
<v Speaker 1>they might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3406
02:42:04.740 --> 02:42:06.210
<v Speaker 1>they might bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3407
02:42:06.290 --> 02:42:07.530
<v Speaker 1>assuming they have an organization</v>

3408
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:10.730
<v Speaker 3>it any damaging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3409
02:42:12.310 --> 02:42:16.130
<v Speaker 3>confidence is about Leah Remini as far </v>
<v Speaker 3>as I know.</v>

3410
02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leah Remini had that situation where she</v>

3411
02:42:18.241 --> 02:42:20.660
<v Speaker 1>was saying that the leader of </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientology,</v>

3412
02:42:20.661 --> 02:42:23.370
<v Speaker 1>his wife was missing Shelly miscavige.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3413
02:42:23.371 --> 02:42:24.240
<v Speaker 1>What's the story there?</v>

3414
02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lear.</v>

3415
02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Is it pronounced remedy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remedy.</v>

3416
02:42:29.090 --> 02:42:32.030
<v Speaker 3>She alleged that David Miscavige,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his wife,</v>

3417
02:42:32.031 --> 02:42:36.860
<v Speaker 3>who hasn't been publicly photographed </v>
<v Speaker 3>allegedly for a number of years,</v>

3418
02:42:37.160 --> 02:42:40.440
<v Speaker 3>maybe even five or 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3419
02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:44.030
<v Speaker 3>was being held captive or had been </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappeared in some way.</v>

3420
02:42:44.050 --> 02:42:46.000
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that she'd had,</v>

3421
02:42:46.040 --> 02:42:49.290
<v Speaker 3>she'd been at Tom Cruise's wedding to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3422
02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:53.210
<v Speaker 3>who would it have been at that point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Katie Holmes in Italy,</v>

3423
02:42:53.211 --> 02:42:56.630
<v Speaker 3>I think and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's David miscavige with shelly.</v>

3424
02:42:56.631 --> 02:43:01.631
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't you here with your wife?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it became a scandal within </v>

3425
02:43:01.631 --> 02:43:06.101
<v Speaker 3>scientology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People felt it was disrespectful to the </v>

3426
02:43:06.101 --> 02:43:08.980
<v Speaker 3>head Honcho David miscavige to be asking</v>
<v Speaker 3>where his wife was so that she got into </v>

3427
02:43:08.980 --> 02:43:09.920
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then she left.</v>

3428
02:43:09.921 --> 02:43:13.510
<v Speaker 3>And then after she left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>initiated a police inquiries.</v>

3429
02:43:13.511 --> 02:43:15.580
<v Speaker 3>She made it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She filed a missing persons report.</v>

3430
02:43:16.060 --> 02:43:17.770
<v Speaker 3>But then the police after a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>days said,</v>

3431
02:43:17.800 --> 02:43:18.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not missing.</v>

3432
02:43:20.050 --> 02:43:25.050
<v Speaker 3>So I guess she's not missing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact is she must be in a retreat </v>

3433
02:43:25.781 --> 02:43:30.781
<v Speaker 3>somewhere somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's people who know know </v>

3434
02:43:30.781 --> 02:43:31.460
<v Speaker 3>where she is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like scientology watchers,</v>

3435
02:43:31.461 --> 02:43:35.320
<v Speaker 3>say there's a certain church </v>
<v Speaker 3>headquarters up in the hills.</v>

3436
02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:42.040
<v Speaker 3>I can't read it somewhere in southern </v>
<v Speaker 3>California and that's where she's </v>

3437
02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:42.040
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

3438
02:43:42.040 --> 02:43:45.841
<v Speaker 3>maybe she just doesn't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>published or maybe she just wants to </v>

3439
02:43:45.841 --> 02:43:45.841
<v Speaker 3>live on her own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like without going public,</v>

3440
02:43:45.841 --> 02:43:48.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's more likely than the idea</v>

3441
02:43:48.581 --> 02:43:50.980
<v Speaker 3>that she's being held against her will.</v>

3442
02:43:51.250 --> 02:43:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3443
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:54.280
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3444
02:43:54.281 --> 02:43:56.920
<v Speaker 1>but I think this kind of goes back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3445
02:43:56.930 --> 02:44:01.930
<v Speaker 1>a Swami g's I what his name was that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who was the supposed physicist who's</v>

3446
02:44:04.030 --> 02:44:05.410
<v Speaker 1>living with Swami Gee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3447
02:44:05.830 --> 02:44:09.040
<v Speaker 1>I think people love being a part of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

3448
02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Whether the group makes sense or doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense.</v>

3449
02:44:11.561 --> 02:44:16.561
<v Speaker 1>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find comfort in that and they also </v>

3450
02:44:16.561 --> 02:44:17.380
<v Speaker 1>get addicted to being a part of a group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you're a part of something</v>

3451
02:44:17.381 --> 02:44:22.381
<v Speaker 1>as powerful scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you look at all the </v>

3452
02:44:22.381 --> 02:44:25.291
<v Speaker 1>examples of people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientologists who are greatly </v>

3453
02:44:25.291 --> 02:44:27.841
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My old neighbor was a scientologist and </v>

3454
02:44:27.841 --> 02:44:30.640
<v Speaker 1>we had this really weird revelation when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came out where he and I were talking,</v>

3455
02:44:30.641 --> 02:44:35.641
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about buying a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>land in our neighborhood and said he </v>

3456
02:44:35.641 --> 02:44:39.580
<v Speaker 1>couldn't buy it right now because his </v>
<v Speaker 1>wife was going clear and I said,</v>

3457
02:44:39.581 --> 02:44:40.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

3458
02:44:40.750 --> 02:44:41.500
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean,</v>

3459
02:44:41.760 --> 02:44:43.090
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3460
02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:45.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're scientologist and uh,</v>

3461
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:48.100
<v Speaker 1>my wife is going to go clear and it cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000.</v>

3462
02:44:48.850 --> 02:44:50.980
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a guy who was a contractor.</v>

3463
02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:52.180
<v Speaker 1>He builds buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3464
02:44:52.181 --> 02:44:53.530
<v Speaker 1>he's not a wealthy man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3465
02:44:53.710 --> 02:44:55.270
<v Speaker 1>he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does fairly well,</v>

3466
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:58.540
<v Speaker 1>but I mean $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a giant chunk of his income.</v>

3467
02:44:59.050 --> 02:45:04.050
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about how his wife is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be no longer affected by </v>

3468
02:45:04.151 --> 02:45:06.880
<v Speaker 1>outside influence and they buy going </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

3469
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:12.030
<v Speaker 1>It eliminates all the negative impact of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talking shit about you or you </v>

3470
02:45:13.231 --> 02:45:14.950
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking traffic,</v>

3471
02:45:14.951 --> 02:45:16.960
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing was going to get in anymore.</v>

3472
02:45:16.961 --> 02:45:21.961
<v Speaker 1>She was clear of all that stuff that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to be removed from.</v>

3473
02:45:22.150 --> 02:45:23.500
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you clear?</v>

3474
02:45:23.570 --> 02:45:28.570
<v Speaker 3>It's like the reactive mind is removed </v>
<v Speaker 3>so you can make decisions without any </v>

3475
02:45:30.290 --> 02:45:33.080
<v Speaker 3>interference from your reactive mind.</v>

3476
02:45:33.280 --> 02:45:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck,</v>

3477
02:45:35.300 --> 02:45:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3478
02:45:36.970 --> 02:45:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3479
02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but this poor guy was going to spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000</v>

3480
02:45:41.021 --> 02:45:44.200
<v Speaker 1>on this and he had this sort of glassy </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyed thing about,</v>

3481
02:45:44.201 --> 02:45:45.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of last thing.</v>

3482
02:45:46.450 --> 02:45:51.250
<v Speaker 1>I think being a part of a group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have these ancestral instincts that I</v>

3483
02:45:51.251 --> 02:45:54.580
<v Speaker 1>think are passed down from the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it was very important to be a part</v>

3484
02:45:54.581 --> 02:45:59.581
<v Speaker 1>of a tribe to stay alive if you're by </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and the hunter and gatherer </v>

3485
02:45:59.581 --> 02:46:02.950
<v Speaker 1>times is very difficult to get enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>food to stay alive.</v>

3486
02:46:03.130 --> 02:46:08.130
<v Speaker 1>It was very hard and I think we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this bond with being a part of a group,</v>

3487
02:46:08.530 --> 02:46:11.630
<v Speaker 1>whether it's fucking Mac users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3488
02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean people that love Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hate pc users.</v>

3489
02:46:15.291 --> 02:46:18.170
<v Speaker 1>People that hate that loved pc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hate Mac.</v>

3490
02:46:18.210 --> 02:46:22.310
<v Speaker 1>They get in these groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Protestants versus the Catholics,</v>

3491
02:46:22.610 --> 02:46:24.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Chevy versus Ford.</v>

3492
02:46:25.130 --> 02:46:29.270
<v Speaker 1>People are weird that we have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>weird desires to be a part of groups.</v>

3493
02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:33.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think someone like the Westboro </v>
<v Speaker 1>Baptist Church,</v>

3494
02:46:33.230 --> 02:46:37.220
<v Speaker 1>or someone likes Swami g's disciples or </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like scientology,</v>

3495
02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:42.580
<v Speaker 1>part of the appeal of that is being in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group and then when you have </v>

3496
02:46:42.580 --> 02:46:47.471
<v Speaker 1>scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not too familiar with what </v>

3497
02:46:47.471 --> 02:46:47.471
<v Speaker 1>scientology does do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beneficial,</v>

3498
02:46:47.471 --> 02:46:51.020
<v Speaker 1>but you look at a guy like Tom Cruise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual stuff aside,</v>

3499
02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:54.470
<v Speaker 1>he's talking about a tremendously </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful person who looks great.</v>

3500
02:46:54.650 --> 02:46:57.950
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking 50 and he looks amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3501
02:46:57.951 --> 02:47:02.951
<v Speaker 1>he's in great health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He seems like really optimistic all the </v>

3502
02:47:02.951 --> 02:47:04.280
<v Speaker 1>time and very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very charismatic,</v>

3503
02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:07.850
<v Speaker 1>very appealing to be a part of a group </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that guy is in.</v>

3504
02:47:08.060 --> 02:47:12.320
<v Speaker 1>If he is benefiting from scientology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the principles of scientology,</v>

3505
02:47:12.710 --> 02:47:15.560
<v Speaker 1>surely it can't all be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surely it can't all be bad.</v>

3506
02:47:16.950 --> 02:47:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Let's say Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're awesome,</v>

3507
02:47:20.181 --> 02:47:22.610
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get out of here and this is.</v>

3508
02:47:22.640 --> 02:47:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I think we're done anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

3509
02:47:23.811 --> 02:47:28.811
<v Speaker 1>We're running a three hours in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We turn into a Pumpkin is three hours </v>

3510
02:47:28.811 --> 02:47:28.811
<v Speaker 1>the normal length?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3511
02:47:28.811 --> 02:47:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>

3512

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3513
02:47:30.090 --> 02:47:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get edited.</v>

3514
02:47:31.460 --> 02:47:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

3515
02:47:33.021 --> 02:47:34.940
<v Speaker 1>it's live and people listened to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole thing.</v>

3516
02:47:34.941 --> 02:47:39.941
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they listened to five minutes </v>

3517
02:47:39.941 --> 02:47:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and then go fucking bullshit liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense park these people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>There's that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you for having me on.</v>

3519
02:47:42.771 --> 02:47:44.660
<v Speaker 1>It was really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to do it again.</v>

3520
02:47:44.661 --> 02:47:46.010
<v Speaker 1>If you ever have anything that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting,</v>

3521
02:47:46.011 --> 02:47:48.440
<v Speaker 1>please don't hesitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have you in an,</v>

3522
02:47:48.560 --> 02:47:50.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the reasons I came with.</v>

3523
02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were two reasons,</v>

3524
02:47:51.141 --> 02:47:52.290
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3525
02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:54.950
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one was,</v>

3526
02:47:54.951 --> 02:47:59.951
<v Speaker 3>I was saying before I came on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a couple of guys outside </v>

3527
02:47:59.951 --> 02:47:59.951
<v Speaker 3>trader Joe's and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were like,</v>

3528
02:47:59.951 --> 02:48:01.580
<v Speaker 3>you've got your own cult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were brainwashed,</v>

3529
02:48:01.610 --> 02:48:02.980
<v Speaker 3>Mooney's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3530
02:48:02.990 --> 02:48:05.820

<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>talking about it.</v>

3534
02:48:12.650 --> 02:48:13.190
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3535
02:48:13.191 --> 02:48:18.191
<v Speaker 3>really?</v>

3539

<v Speaker 3>well he's obviously got a lot of pull </v>

<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

3541
02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:29.090
<v Speaker 3>and just more generally like it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love getting feedback from people </v>

3542
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:31.931
<v Speaker 3>who've seen me on youtube button,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm trying to kind of put the word </v>

3543
02:48:31.931 --> 02:48:31.931
<v Speaker 3>out that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3544
02:48:31.931 --> 02:48:32.810
<v Speaker 3>I think it's illegal actually.</v>

3545
02:48:32.810 --> 02:48:34.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't think people are supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have it up there,</v>

3546
02:48:34.161 --> 02:48:35.360
<v Speaker 3>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay with it.</v>

3547
02:48:35.530 --> 02:48:37.430
<v Speaker 3>Why is it illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think it's ABC.</v>

3548
02:48:37.490 --> 02:48:40.040
<v Speaker 3>Technically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>BBC also they get it though.</v>

3549
02:48:40.980 --> 02:48:42.770
<v Speaker 3>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the whole thing.</v>

3550
02:48:42.771 --> 02:48:47.771
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they could get it </v>
<v Speaker 3>otherwise it on Netflix or only in the </v>

3551
02:48:47.771 --> 02:48:51.101
<v Speaker 3>UK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on Netflix and on different around </v>

3552
02:48:51.101 --> 02:48:53.441
<v Speaker 3>the world on different channels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the BBC is trying to monetize it so </v>

3553
02:48:53.441 --> 02:48:57.131
<v Speaker 3>they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to retain rights and keep </v>

3554
02:48:57.131 --> 02:48:57.131
<v Speaker 3>selling it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as far as I'm concerned,</v>

3555
02:48:57.131 --> 02:49:01.601
<v Speaker 3>it gets a lot of hits on Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's nice to go for you for people </v>

3556
02:49:01.601 --> 02:49:01.601
<v Speaker 3>to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3557
02:49:01.601 --> 02:49:03.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean it puts no money in my pocket,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm fine with it.</v>

3558
02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Well you've done some brilliant work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating stuff.</v>

3559
02:49:06.930 --> 02:49:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten countless hours of </v>

3560
02:49:11.930 --> 02:49:11.930
<v Speaker 1>entertainment out of your programming I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think so.</v>

3561
02:49:11.930 --> 02:49:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate having you on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really enjoyable.</v>

3562
02:49:14.310 --> 02:49:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See you next.</v>

3563
02:49:15.780 --> 02:49:17.160
<v Speaker 1>What do you got coming up that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>could say?</v>

3564
02:49:17.210 --> 02:49:17.770
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything that</v>

3565
02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:23.440
<v Speaker 3>three shows going out in Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new ones going up the end of March and </v>

3566
02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:26.591
<v Speaker 3>so they'll probably be put up quite soon</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's the thing I was telling about </v>

3567
02:49:26.591 --> 02:49:27.530
<v Speaker 3>La Stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the first one is about strain,</v>

3568
02:49:27.550 --> 02:49:32.550
<v Speaker 3>abandoned dogs and our attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 3>rehabilitate them using a controversial </v>

3569
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:33.810
<v Speaker 3>dog therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3570
02:49:33.811 --> 02:49:36.870
<v Speaker 3>it's like turning criminal dogs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing them,</v>

3571
02:49:36.871 --> 02:49:40.140
<v Speaker 3>rescuing them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bringing him into middle class homes and</v>

3572
02:49:40.141 --> 02:49:45.141
<v Speaker 3>then sometimes they attack the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>owners and then thousands of them are </v>

3573
02:49:45.141 --> 02:49:48.891
<v Speaker 3>killed every year in the shelters in La </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a huge stray and neglected dog </v>

3574
02:49:48.891 --> 02:49:50.440
<v Speaker 3>problem in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second one is about the,</v>

3575
02:49:50.490 --> 02:49:55.140
<v Speaker 3>the hospitals where people are sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>under pressure to keep trying new,</v>

3576
02:49:55.170 --> 02:50:00.170
<v Speaker 3>like they're close to possibly dying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a new experimental therapy </v>

3577
02:50:00.170 --> 02:50:04.940
<v Speaker 3>and they have the insurance to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and it's this weird 21st century </v>

3578
02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:05.970
<v Speaker 3>conundrum of when do I stop and say </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3579
02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:07.590
<v Speaker 3>I just want to have a peaceful death.</v>

3580
02:50:08.050 --> 02:50:13.050
<v Speaker 3>When am I allowed to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to try any more chemo or </v>

3581
02:50:13.050 --> 02:50:13.050
<v Speaker 3>these on BBC America?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3582
02:50:13.050 --> 02:50:13.710
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're on the UK,</v>

3583
02:50:13.711 --> 02:50:18.711
<v Speaker 3>BBC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>normal BBC and the third one is about </v>

3584
02:50:18.711 --> 02:50:21.471
<v Speaker 3>sex offenders living down in south la,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially around torrance who live in </v>

3585
02:50:21.471 --> 02:50:24.060
<v Speaker 3>these hostels with a electronic </v>
<v Speaker 3>bracelets,</v>

3586
02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:29.360
<v Speaker 3>heavily monitored lives and the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the strangeness of having done something</v>

3587
02:50:29.581 --> 02:50:30.580
<v Speaker 3>so terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3588
02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:34.350
<v Speaker 3>they've abused their own children or </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them are rapists and so on.</v>

3589
02:50:34.920 --> 02:50:36.540
<v Speaker 3>And then they've done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3590
02:50:36.570 --> 02:50:41.570
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're 10 years in prison and they've </v>

3591
02:50:41.570 --> 02:50:41.910
<v Speaker 3>come out and they're on parole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to what extent,</v>

3592
02:50:42.090 --> 02:50:42.900
<v Speaker 3>if any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3593
02:50:43.020 --> 02:50:45.060
<v Speaker 3>do we give people a second chance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I give her.</v>

3594
02:50:45.090 --> 02:50:46.200
<v Speaker 3>They're out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to live.</v>

3595
02:50:46.201 --> 02:50:48.420
<v Speaker 3>We are living alongside them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3596
02:50:48.421 --> 02:50:51.690
<v Speaker 3>more or less with certain restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we,</v>

3597
02:50:51.691 --> 02:50:53.050
<v Speaker 3>how do we relate to those guys?</v>

3598
02:50:53.180 --> 02:50:55.250
