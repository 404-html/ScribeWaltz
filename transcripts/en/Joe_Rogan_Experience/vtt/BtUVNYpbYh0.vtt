1
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>It was a thing on our reality sandwich worked.</v>

2
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>I was criticizing the salt stoned ape theory and it was only based on one point,</v>

3
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>the visual acuity point.</v>

4
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:22.241
<v Speaker 1>They were arguing about Roland Fischer's work on visual acuity being measurably</v>

5
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>improved by who knows?</v>

6
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>You could try that.</v>

7
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:26.521
<v Speaker 1>I looked that up.</v>

8
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>I can find that study.</v>

9
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>I didn't find it either.</v>

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.521
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's wrong,</v>

12
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's still like to chart harp on one.</v>

13
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Fairly insignificant portion of the theory.</v>

15
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>The theory never made sense to me in that regard.</v>

16
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.291
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

17
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>the visual acuity thing,</v>

18
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 1>because that's in low doses.</v>

19
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.741
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're saying.</v>

20
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>But they're not eating low doses.</v>

21
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>They're eating a lot of that shit.</v>

22
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>Why low doses if they could find it,</v>

23
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.841
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

25
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>they're eating probably tons of it.</v>

26
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>We talked to,</v>

27
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.420
<v Speaker 1>we talked to our primatologists about it and he said that the time period that</v>

28
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>Mckenna has using does not work for the way he understands,</v>

29
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.883
<v Speaker 1>climate,</v>

31
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>the growth of the neo cortex and predominance apparently.</v>

32
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>so his theory about the massive expansion of our brains,</v>

34
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

35
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Did it happen way before Mckenna says the stoned ape theory or what's happening.</v>

36
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>But then he might've been confused about that time period cause they,</v>

37
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I believe Macanta mine at candidate know Mckenna says that early plasticine</v>

38
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:22.561
<v Speaker 1>error I think.</v>

39
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

40
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

41
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

42
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Well the theory for the folks who don't know what the fuck are they is,</v>

43
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>the theory is that at one point in time monkeys climb down from the trees and</v>

44
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>they were experimenting with new food sources and they started eating suicide as</v>

45
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms because there was these great herds of Unpeel it cattle that were,</v>

46
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.140
<v Speaker 1>hooked cattle that are wandering around the fields dropping shits and that these</v>

48
00:01:42.141 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms grow from these shits and these,</v>

49
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.391
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

50
00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:44.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>monkeys and baboons have been dead.</v>

52
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>They've demonstrated them lifting up cow patties and looking for bugs and stuff</v>

53
00:01:50.331 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>on that you think cause it's all moist and,</v>

54
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>and that eating these mushrooms that grew on these,</v>

55
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>these cow shits made them more,</v>

56
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>more evolved and made them,</v>

57
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>like doubled the size of the human brain may have them develop language.</v>

59
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.813
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

61
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.683
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

62
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>

63
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

64
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.671
<v Speaker 1>Look at us.</v>

65
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:11.271
<v Speaker 1>And look at them.</v>

66
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucking clear.</v>

67
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Is that a big Goddamn gap?</v>

68
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.001
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

69
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>What is this gap?</v>

70
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.043
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

71
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's that crazy,</v>

72
00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 1>a crazy idea and you know,</v>

73
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.100
<v Speaker 1>most people I talk to you,</v>

74
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

75
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.920
<v Speaker 1>their main response scientists gave was like,</v>

76
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>you know you need a time machine.</v>

77
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It really proved that theory.</v>

78
00:02:26.591 --> 00:02:27.424
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

79
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:28.600
<v Speaker 1>don't get your eyes.</v>

80
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 1>See this gentleman,</v>

81
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest podcast cast,</v>

82
00:02:32.161 --> 00:02:32.994
<v Speaker 1>if not the greatest</v>

83
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>all time flows.</v>

84
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an ax.</v>

85
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

86
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem I was worried about.</v>

87
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I am sure I was worried about you being a little too trendy.</v>

88
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 1>It's fun cop breath stretching.</v>

89
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.841
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that ordered.</v>

90
00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>I worked out with Steve Maxwell and Toronto and I ordered an Indian club bells.</v>

91
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.690
<v Speaker 1>There were this big iron baseball bats and you're like,</v>

92
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.023
<v Speaker 2>oh</v>

93
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.861
<v Speaker 1>the barely do it.</v>

94
00:03:06.861 --> 00:03:07.431
<v Speaker 1>10 pounds,</v>

95
00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:07.551
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

96
00:03:07.551 --> 00:03:08.061
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

97
00:03:08.061 --> 00:03:09.080
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy exercise.</v>

98
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>So I ordered these 15 pounders and I'm going to build up to 45 pounders.</v>

99
00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.810
<v Speaker 1>That's when you're a fucking real ox.</v>

100
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.310
<v Speaker 1>When you're a real animal and you want to put the squeezed off.</v>

101
00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

102
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.780
<v Speaker 1>I've been out for almost two months now.</v>

103
00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:21.614
<v Speaker 1>The back injury?</v>

104
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:03:23.301 --> 00:03:26.540
<v Speaker 1>I had a reoccurring thing where I would pop out a rib head.</v>

106
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.090
<v Speaker 1>So what I decided to do is just work out a lot of it,</v>

107
00:03:29.091 --> 00:03:29.990
<v Speaker 1>do a lot of cardio,</v>

108
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:31.280
<v Speaker 1>a lot of hitting the bag and stuff.</v>

109
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Actually I got leaner and um,</v>

110
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

111
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>less uh,</v>

112
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>less rolling and more like high rep kettlebell stuff and a lot,</v>

113
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>a lot of like different strength and conditioning shit cause I,</v>

114
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.590
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

115
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.810
<v Speaker 1>this injury kept happening.</v>

116
00:03:44.811 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 1>It can't,</v>

117
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

118
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.440
<v Speaker 1>it happened over a course of a few months over and over again in the same spot.</v>

119
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.981
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

120
00:03:48.981 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

121
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.971
<v Speaker 1>I need to get in this thing.</v>

122
00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Some actual real time off or it's going to be crying.</v>

123
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>You got no guy like you and your physique.</v>

124
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:56.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have to worry about that crest scratch.</v>

125
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.393
<v Speaker 1>We'll have</v>

<v Speaker 4>isn't that like a prerequisite?</v>

442
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:18.640
<v Speaker 4>Like if you thought about moving to some other parts of the country,</v>

443
00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.640
<v Speaker 4>like when I moved to Colorado and one of the first things I thought I was like,</v>

444
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:21.801
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

445
00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:23.110
<v Speaker 4>and Colorado's got medical potlucks.</v>

446
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.581
<v Speaker 4>Who was like,</v>

447
00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

448
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:23.921
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

449
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:24.754
<v Speaker 4>it's just like yell.</v>

450
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.593
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

451
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:25.961
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

452
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:26.051
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

453
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:29.090
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing is all the places that I gravitate towards on the road are</v>

454
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.110
<v Speaker 4>either places where the whole state has medical or a particular city is cooler</v>

455
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:35.380
<v Speaker 4>than other cities,</v>

456
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:35.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

457
00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:38.590
<v Speaker 4>so like it's more decriminalized in some places than others.</v>

458
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 4>And those tend to be the same cities.</v>

459
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:41.060
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy performing it.</v>

460
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:41.741
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

461
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:42.281
<v Speaker 4>Austin,</v>

462
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 4>Texas is a great example of like some places around there.</v>

463
00:12:45.941 --> 00:12:46.774
<v Speaker 4>I'd be in pretty,</v>

464
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:47.681
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

465
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 4>I'd have to be pretty paranoid about my behavior,</v>

466
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.210
<v Speaker 4>but in Austin you can sort of get away with,</v>

467
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

468
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.100
<v Speaker 4>I know you're doing Ann Arbor,</v>

469
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Michigan,</v>

470
00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:55.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

471
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:56.023
<v Speaker 4>I love that place.</v>

472
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:56.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

473
00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.370
<v Speaker 4>that place is awesome.</v>

474
00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 4>That's a place where you wouldn't realize,</v>

475
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:01.030
<v Speaker 4>he would know bash,</v>

476
00:13:01.031 --> 00:13:03.790
<v Speaker 4>bash for years before Michigan.</v>

477
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 4>And the medical,</v>

478
00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:09.700
<v Speaker 4>and I think also in was probably the reason why medical got over the hump and</v>

479
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Michigan because there so into it.</v>

480
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.460
<v Speaker 4>And that one city,</v>

481
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 4>have you ever seen the four 20 day in Boulder?</v>

482
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.560

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 4>They go on the campus and everyone smokes out like the whole campus.</v>

487
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:27.160
<v Speaker 4>Like there's clouds of smoke.</v>

488
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:27.671

<v Speaker 4>that's what I tried to do.</v>

502
00:13:51.371 --> 00:13:51.581
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

503
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:56.581
<v Speaker 4>This year I was in Sacramento at such a great we town and it was fun to do it</v>

504
00:13:56.651 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

505
00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

506
00:13:57.071 --> 00:14:00.550
<v Speaker 4>record a record standing in front of the Capitol building that they have drawn</v>

507
00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 4>there on the wall at the punchline in Sacramento.</v>

508
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.090
<v Speaker 4>So it was pretty fun.</v>

509
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.250
<v Speaker 4>So you already have coming out later this year.</v>

510
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 4>But that's what I do is every year.</v>

511
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

512
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:08.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

513
00:14:08.771 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 4>there's a few cities I'm considering for a,</v>

514
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:11.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

515
00:14:11.231 --> 00:14:12.070
<v Speaker 4>for next year,</v>

516
00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:12.851
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like,</v>

517
00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:13.661
<v Speaker 4>it's a great knife.</v>

518
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:14.680
<v Speaker 4>We are recording an album.</v>

519
00:14:14.681 --> 00:14:16.680
<v Speaker 4>It's a great way for me to always know you,</v>

520
00:14:16.681 --> 00:14:17.514
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

521
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.160
<v Speaker 4>people say for 20 to me so much that it's always top of mine.</v>

522
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:25.540
<v Speaker 4>So like I know that like right now I know I've got like 11 months to get the,</v>

523
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:25.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

524
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:29.170
<v Speaker 4>the next material ready to go for another album.</v>

525
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.250
<v Speaker 4>And so I'll start ditching the stuff from this album and replacing it with newer</v>

526
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:33.611
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

527
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:34.840
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

528
00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:39.280
<v Speaker 4>it's a whole cycle that I go through that seems to be working.</v>

529
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.710
<v Speaker 4>So no boulders show bitches.</v>

530
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:42.791
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

531
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:44.500
<v Speaker 4>but I definitely want to boulder event.</v>

532
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm definitely working on,</v>

533
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

534
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.740
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to go do a show in boulder in,</v>

535
00:14:47.741 --> 00:14:48.220
<v Speaker 4>in uh,</v>

536
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.620
<v Speaker 4>September because that is a great place to go and I've never done up there.</v>

537
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.101
<v Speaker 4>I lived there,</v>

538
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 4>but I never ever performed there.</v>

539
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 4>I think when I was living there I was like,</v>

540
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I should be doing standup where I live.</v>

541
00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.051
<v Speaker 4>It's a little town.</v>

542
