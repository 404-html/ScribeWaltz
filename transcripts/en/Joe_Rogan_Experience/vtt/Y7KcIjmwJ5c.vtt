1
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:02.931
Oh Shits.

2
00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:03.764
We pitches.

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.860
Here we are again.

4
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.230
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you.

5
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:08.970
This episode is brought to you by Hover,

6
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.201
h.

7
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.640
O.

8
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.640
V.

9
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.640
E.

10
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.730
R.

11
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.250
If you go to hover.com forward slash,

12
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:14.701
Rogan,

13
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:16.980
you will get 10% off of your domain name.

14
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:18.930
I got to fuck an ant on my computer.

15
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.340
Note how I squash ants and throw them to the table with no regard.

16
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.210
You know why?

17
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.850
Because there's so much smaller than me that I can't be bothered.

18
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.530
But any bigger than that,

19
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.750
you got to clean it up like you get to a roach.

20
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.111
All right,

21
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:32.040
now you've got a problem,

22
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.880
but an aunt,

23
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.121
no,

24
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:36.390
I crushed that bitch and that will continue with my conversation as if nothing

25
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:37.140
happened.

26
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.820
While it's eviscerated,

27
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:43.821
body smushed beneath my giant fingers just lies there rotting on the Oak table,

28
00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.920
hover.com forward slash rug and you will get 10% off of your domain name

29
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:50.754
registrations.

30
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.960
And a hover is a company that's owned by the same people that own ting.

31
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.730
And if you know how we feel about ting,

32
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.350
it's the same way we feel about Hubbard.

33
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.330
Their approach is they're trying to be a non evil domain name company.

34
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.463
Is that funny?

35
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.163
It's much,

36
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.210
yeah.

37
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.800
Nobody gives a fuck about ants man.

38
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.090
You know,

39
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.890
even vegans step on an ant,

40
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.810
they got to do what they gotta do.

41
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.801
However,

42
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:17.281
believes that,

43
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:17.730
uh,

44
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.300
you know,

45
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.300
there's a lot of shit that is not attached to a most domain name registration.

46
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.110
That should be like,

47
00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:25.980
I'm like,

48
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:30.981
who is privacy sub domains and a URL forwarding stuff that you have to pay for a

49
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:33.810
lot of places have or things that you should she get that Shit for free?

50
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.381
Should be.

51
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:36.300
It's the same approach that they have to Tang.

52
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.641
They,

53
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:36.960
they're,

54
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.440
they're taking that same approach and a using it for domain names.

55
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.930
So if you want to register a domain name,

56
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.520
please go to hover h,

57
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:44.761
o,

58
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:45.150
v,

59
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.020
e r and if you go to hover.com forward slash Rogen,

60
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.210
you will save yourself some kids,

61
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:51.661
Ash,

62
00:01:51.661 --> 00:01:52.494
son,

63
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.510
go there and get your paper.

64
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.350
Save yourself 10% off any of your donor domain name registrations.

65
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.760
We were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com we drinking some on it.com

66
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.640
bulletproof coffee cause we started carrying it because it's the shit.

67
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.180
Uh,

68
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.571
you uh,

69
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:07.404
appreciate it.

70
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.941
Tim Ferris,

71
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:11.910
do you realize the difference between this and the micro toxin filled coffee

72
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:12.940
that you drink every day?

73
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.200
I just feel like I have an ivy of MCT oil feeding my brain.

74
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.191
It's fantastic.

75
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.920
Problem is it coats your mouth though sometimes and it gives you a little phlegm

76
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.910
catfish breath.

77
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.140
Yeah.

78
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.461
You're,

79
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:23.310
you're having some issues with the stimulants

80
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.870
affection but this is that what I have a yeast infection.

81
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.611
Goddamn it,

82
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:31.440
they smelled like tuna and I was worried about that.

83
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.323
Yeah.

84
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.720
And that kind of fish though.

85
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.613
Not Kidding.

86
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.820
Why Catfish?

87
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.451
I don't know.

88
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:38.700
My girlfriend said I smelled like death sweats earlier,

89
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:42.460
so I smelled like cat fish cause I was experimenting with Bacopa plus Grapesy,

90
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.590
a grapefruit seed extract and some of the stimulants to see how it extended the

91
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:46.951
effects.

92
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:48.300
But I just had this thought that catfish,

93
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.410
we will get all,

94
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.700
we're going to get down to that.

95
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.700
We're going to have to get to the bug to that,

96
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.200
go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash go fuck yourself because there's no

97
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:00.510
forward slash she used to name rogue and you'll save 10% off.

98
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.130
But uh,

99
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.910
we carry a lot of cool shit.

100
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.280
Now a 10% off any of all supplements if used code name Brogan a,

101
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.780
it doesn't work for the fitness equipment,

102
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.560
but it's because we sell it as cheap as humanly possible.

103
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.110
We started carrying kettlebells,

104
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.960
battle ropes,

105
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:13.830
medicine balls,

106
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.360
uh,

107
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.080
basically all functional strength stuff,

108
00:03:16.081 --> 00:03:18.570
all the types of things I would be into.

109
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.960
If you are really interested in on it,

110
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.490
go to go to the website and check it out.

111
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:25.500
Or if you really want to go in depth,

112
00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:30.501
you can listen to the podcast that we had was two podcasts ago with Aubrey

113
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.561
Marcus who is the,

114
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:31.771
uh,

115
00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:34.560
the CEO and a business partner and on it.

116
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.760
And he's um,

117
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.350
he's an awesome dude and his,

118
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:39.750
his idea and the way he's running the company,

119
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.640
it's very admirable.

120
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.750
The whole idea behind it is sell people the best shit possible.

121
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.190
Find the best ingredients,

122
00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:50.280
sell that and sell it at a reasonable rate.

123
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.770
We sell a lot of shit like we sell Blendtec blenders,

124
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.580
$200 less than the manufactured suggested retail price.

125
00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.820
We just try to sell you shit that is like really good effective stuff for your

126
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:03.660
health.

127
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.260
Whether it's a hemp force protein powder or whether it's Alpha brain,

128
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.250
which is a cognitive enhancing supplement that I fucking swear by it.

129
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.570
I don't do podcasts without it.

130
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.520
I think you need nutrients folks.

131
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.383
It's important.

132
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.220
Keep your fucking Nog and fed.

133
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.540
<v 1>Keep your body healthy.</v>

134
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:20.340
Am I right Tim Ferriss fucking a year,

135
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:20.551
right?

136
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:21.420
What does a battle rope,

137
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.111
that's my question.

138
00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:26.340
Battle ropes are these big giant ship yard ropes and the lady said Ro,

139
00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
<v 2>Oh rose [inaudible] when I go to the bathroom it's like a weighted bathroom.</v>

140
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:40.101
I was like,

141
00:04:40.101 --> 00:04:43.320
cause that will cross cross fit

142
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.083
<v 1>bad idea.</v>

143
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.980
I mean they have weighted vests.

144
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.420
How about a whole weighted outfit?

145
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.450
Will you've got to move your whole body with like weighted arms and shit.

146
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:51.701
I bet.

147
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:55.020
So it'd be a good workout and they'd probably come up with some reason why it

148
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:55.291
works.

149
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:56.270
We'll proportionately,

150
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.330
when you carry weights,

151
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.220
it's not right because your weight,

152
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.280
the extra week should be distributed through your whole body in order for you to

153
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:03.180
gain mathematics,

154
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.111
mathematical,

155
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:05.010
athletic inputs.

156
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.720
You want to start wearing armor is weight our army,

157
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:08.311
your army,

158
00:05:08.311 --> 00:05:09.690
when is have them start wearing armor.

159
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.140
<v 2>Say that if you were trying to harm or you'd be stronger the on it on the Rogan</v>

160
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.410
plate.

161
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.040
Male line.

162
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.060
I don't think that's a bad idea.

163
00:05:17.061 --> 00:05:19.700
This is a good way to introduce the idea of wearing armor.

164
00:05:19.701 --> 00:05:21.500
So the government's thought like,

165
00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:22.880
what the fuck are you preparing for?

166
00:05:22.881 --> 00:05:24.080
The God of ropes.

167
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.381
Hey,

168
00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:25.340
we're trying to work out.

169
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.460
We're crossfitters were all peaceful and Scott is a Vegan and I grass

170
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.293
<v 1>fed</v>

171
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.410
battle ropes are these gigantic ropes that you swing for endurance.

172
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:38.540
So fucking awesome.

173
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:39.270
Yeah,

174
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.090
I do these wild 32nd sprints with them.

175
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.630
It's,

176
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.790
it's so applicable for Jujitsu,

177
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.660
kickboxing,

178
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:46.650
anything physical.

179
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:47.581
It's cause it's,

180
00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:49.740
you're moving this awkward weight over,

181
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:50.171
you know,

182
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:50.491
and you know,

183
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:51.390
30 foot,

184
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:54.810
40 foot length and whipping it back and forth.

185
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.990
Have you ever seen a Zach [inaudible]?

186
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.651
No.

187
00:05:57.651 --> 00:05:58.100
What's that?

188
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.221
Oh,

189
00:05:58.221 --> 00:05:58.551
he's a,

190
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:00.920
he's a trainer out of New Jersey.

191
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:01.250
I said,

192
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.910
well,

193
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.400
let me just congratulate him on his bad ass name.

194
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.210
That's a great name.

195
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.901
What's his name again?

196
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.531
Zappa.

197
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.550
Nash Esch.

198
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:08.300
Evan.

199
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.590
That's a pretty great finish.

200
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.951
Yes.

201
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:10.521
H and he,

202
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:10.900
uh,

203
00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.610
name Zach an ish?

204
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.100
Yeah.

205
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.940
Ooh.

206
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.451
Yeah.

207
00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:15.284
It's like a duck.

208
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.740
Sounds like a Dothraki.

209
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.253
Does

210
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:23.720
anyone he uses ropes.

211
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:24.440
He's a beast.

212
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.891
Oh yeah.

213
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:25.581
Ropes are awesome,

214
00:06:25.581 --> 00:06:25.790
man.

215
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:26.520
Medicine balls.

216
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.160
Another thing I've been using a lot lately.

217
00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.510
Uh,

218
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.981
I just,

219
00:06:28.981 --> 00:06:29.210
uh,

220
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.120
I just hired a trainer two months ago for the first time ever.

221
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:32.601
I mean,

222
00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:33.680
I've used guys before.

223
00:06:33.681 --> 00:06:35.030
I've trained was like Steve Maxwell,

224
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.260
but I've never used a guy every week on a regular basis over and over and over

225
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:40.850
again until I started using this one guy.

226
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.830
And we're doing a lot of wacky shit.

227
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.511
How'd you choose him?

228
00:06:43.511 --> 00:06:44.344
Why did you choose the,

229
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.340
his name's Justin.

230
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:47.480
These are my Jujitsu class.

231
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.010
He's a,

232
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.280
it was a high level wrestler,

233
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.270
division one wrestler,

234
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:52.550
really talented athlete and uh,

235
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.360
just one school for it and is really passionate about it and watching them

236
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:56.631
train.

237
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:56.931
And I was like,

238
00:06:56.931 --> 00:06:58.130
these motherfuckers never tired.

239
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.881
So I went to him.

240
00:06:58.881 --> 00:06:59.091
I'm like,

241
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:00.020
what are you doing for training?

242
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.741
Because we're,

243
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:01.250
you know,

244
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.200
when you're training me,

245
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.381
he's,

246
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:03.214
he's a brown belt.

247
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:03.870
You're training,

248
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.551
we're talking about,

249
00:07:04.551 --> 00:07:05.690
he's training with black belts.

250
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:07.310
Who trained with Eddie Bravo is training with,

251
00:07:07.311 --> 00:07:07.701
you know,

252
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:10.130
a lot of the killers that they have a 10th planet.

253
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.500
And I'm looking at this kid's in Dorrance.

254
00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:11.810
I'm like,

255
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.070
I'm really impressed.

256
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:13.611
It was like fourth,

257
00:07:13.611 --> 00:07:16.400
fifth role and he's got going at a high clip.

258
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:16.641
I'm like,

259
00:07:16.641 --> 00:07:17.301
you're doing something like,

260
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:18.050
what are you doing?

261
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.340
He's like a lot of kettle bells,

262
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:20.031
a lot of body weights,

263
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:20.541
this and then he goes,

264
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:21.051
I'm a trainer.

265
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:22.010
So I just started working out with them.

266
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.640
Cool.

267
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.610
So I had been doing a lot of it on my own before.

268
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:26.300
But it,

269
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.541
man,

270
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:27.780
it makes a big difference when you,

271
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:29.210
when you work out with somebody just fucking,

272
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:30.110
it makes you a division one.

273
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:31.090
Wrestlers are mutants.

274
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.430
Incredibly incredible.

275
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.250
He's got a lot of uh,

276
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.360
great ideas too that came along like while,

277
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.121
I mean he's young kid,

278
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:43.121
he's like 26 so while he was learning like a lot of liquid in the last two

279
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:44.151
decades,

280
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:49.151
they've made some huge strides when it comes to the actual work versus the

281
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:50.261
actual result.

282
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.410
Like what's overtraining,

283
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:51.830
what's,

284
00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:52.160
you know,

285
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.290
heart rate monitors necessary,

286
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:54.561
what's,

287
00:07:54.561 --> 00:07:55.120
what's going,

288
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.460
let's mad at monitor the your entire system instead of just pushing you.

289
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.520
Because there was a lot of like nonsense just pushing you in the past and they

290
00:08:02.521 --> 00:08:06.140
sort of narrowed it down to a science and the kids that are coming up now,

291
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:08.180
they're going through like good division one schools.

292
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.280
They know what the fuck they're doing when they're training these kids.

293
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:10.611
Oh yeah.

294
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:11.720
They're like professional teams.

295
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.430
And it's what's been fascinating too,

296
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:17.000
is that he looked at the vast majority of research on athletic performance over

297
00:08:17.001 --> 00:08:17.331
the last,

298
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:18.200
let's say 50 years.

299
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.010
Most of it is in 45 minute or 90 minute intervals.

300
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:26.090
So they had to design experiments that would allow people to say exercise for

301
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:27.860
that period of time because what is that?

302
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:28.694
It's a college,

303
00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:30.380
it's the length of a college class.

304
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:34.220
And they were recruiting college students to participate as subjects for most of

305
00:08:34.221 --> 00:08:34.940
these.

306
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.511
In other words,

307
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.660
they didn't actually have the funding to study,

308
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:43.520
let's say the effect of 32nd sprints on a robot capacity.

309
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:48.470
Like there's a fantastic research and invite Gibala gib a la who's looked at how

310
00:08:48.471 --> 00:08:53.471
you could do two to three minutes if cumulative sprint time and increase your

311
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.070
capacity or endurance as much as let's

312
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.590
<v 3>say four to six hours of steady state training per week.</v>

313
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.420
Why isn't that crazy?

314
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:00.840
Yeah,

315
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.531
it's amazing.

316
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.860
And I actually started playing around with it like 120%,

317
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.863
uh,

318
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.620
Max vo two on a stationary bike for,

319
00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.170
so very similar to Tabata protocol,

320
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.820
but you're taking let's say 32nd sprints.

321
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.370
And what I ended up doing was just taking very long rest intervals,

322
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:20.160
32nd sprint long rest in a role almost as a long,

323
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.110
I would do perhaps six.

324
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:22.351
Oh,

325
00:09:22.351 --> 00:09:23.610
are you talking about the rest period?

326
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.870
I would rest two to three minutes.

327
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.850
I do the exact same thing I do.

328
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.630
Oh,

329
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.890
I do less rest time.

330
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.910
I do 30 seconds on,

331
00:09:29.911 --> 00:09:30.780
30 seconds off.

332
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:31.230
Yeah.

333
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.850
And I've been doing that for a while.

334
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:33.720
On a elliptical,

335
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.291
full clip.

336
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:34.891
On an elliptical.

337
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:35.200
Yeah.

338
00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:35.740
A and,

339
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.280
and it's,

340
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.350
it's just incredible when you start to see money coming into this research.

341
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:45.351
Partially because the technology like wearable sensors and accelerometers and

342
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:48.720
all of this are becoming big business.

343
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:49.950
Like if Nike plus and whatnot.

344
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.670
So there's a lot,

345
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:55.440
there's a lot more cash than has ever been available for athletic performance

346
00:09:55.441 --> 00:09:56.160
enhancement.

347
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.371
Dude,

348
00:09:56.371 --> 00:09:57.870
I just realized we're still in the middle of the commercial.

349
00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.360
<v 0>Oh.</v>

350
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.860
And and I t use a code name Brogan,

351
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.080
save 10% off any and all supplements.

352
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.830
All right.

353
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.470
We just dropped some knowledge in the middle of a commercial.

354
00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.790
Let's start this bitch.

355
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:10.410
Tim Ferriss has too much information.

356
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.310
It's filling out

357
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.160
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

358
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.870
called the Tim Ferris.

359
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.630
You were dropping so much knowledge

360
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:28.520
<v 0>and it was in the middle of a commercial.</v>

361
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.510
That's how,

362
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.560
that's how bad ass you are.

363
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.390
I just got them a 10 minute commercial.

364
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:32.790
Yeah.

365
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:33.110
The,

366
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.050
this you said that you were smelling like catfish because you were taking

367
00:10:36.051 --> 00:10:36.980
certain stimulants.

368
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.000
Yeah.

369
00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:38.510
Yeah.

370
00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.343
I don't know.

371
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:40.691
<v 3>I don't,</v>

372
00:10:40.691 --> 00:10:41.080
uh,

373
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.740
well I've been playing around with a few different smart drugs.

374
00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:47.620
I got it out of smart drugs for a long time because like I mentioned before we

375
00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:48.071
get started.

376
00:10:48.071 --> 00:10:50.710
I just don't think there is a biological free lunch.

377
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.480
So if you see a really strong effect,

378
00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.430
whether you can identify the side effect or not,

379
00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:56.700
I think there's an equal amplitude of seismic height of,

380
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:56.851
<v 0>well,</v>

381
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:59.510
let's just be real about what we're talking about because it's,

382
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.800
both of us have kind of skirted around the issue.

383
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:02.071
It's,

384
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:02.430
it's,

385
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.540
I have definitely,

386
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.800
it's called provigil.

387
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:06.323
Provigil,

388
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.110
you know,

389
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.531
we found,

390
00:11:07.531 --> 00:11:08.850
I found out about it because,

391
00:11:08.851 --> 00:11:09.390
uh,

392
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.200
Dave Asprey,

393
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.530
who I was incredibly impressed with came on the podcast and talked about

394
00:11:13.531 --> 00:11:15.650
anything and everything and um,

395
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.050
was just,

396
00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.880
he had so much energy and then someone sent me this message like,

397
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.031
oh,

398
00:11:21.031 --> 00:11:22.410
the guy does pro vigil,

399
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.550
like go check it out.

400
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.220
Like he's,

401
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.230
he's on speed.

402
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.580
Oh,

403
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.413
okay.

404
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:27.841
I'm like,

405
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:29.220
well that makes sense to the guy was like,

406
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:30.330
but he didn't seem speedy.

407
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:30.751
So I'm like,

408
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:31.051
okay,

409
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:31.591
that's weird.

410
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:32.490
Cause he didn't seem like,

411
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:32.880
you know,

412
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.130
there's people that seem,

413
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.981
they're weird.

414
00:11:34.981 --> 00:11:35.731
Like you're talking to him.

415
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:36.330
Like there's,

416
00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.800
you're missing the energy of this room.

417
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.041
You're,

418
00:11:38.041 --> 00:11:38.281
you're,

419
00:11:38.281 --> 00:11:41.160
you're overstepping your awkward timing.

420
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.371
Yeah,

421
00:11:41.371 --> 00:11:41.501
yeah,

422
00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:42.000
yeah.

423
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.030
Timing issue there.

424
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:44.550
They're wacky,

425
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.150
you know,

426
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.901
he wasn't like that.

427
00:11:45.901 --> 00:11:47.340
It was completely in the moment.

428
00:11:47.341 --> 00:11:49.260
So what he discussed,

429
00:11:49.261 --> 00:11:49.471
he said,

430
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:49.851
I wasn't,

431
00:11:49.851 --> 00:11:50.790
I'm pro vigil when I was there.

432
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:52.000
I actually don't take it anymore,

433
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.820
but I did take it every day for almost eight years with great benefit.

434
00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.660
And I was like,

435
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.350
Oh wow,

436
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.800
whoa.

437
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.460
What?

438
00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:58.770
Like,

439
00:11:58.770 --> 00:11:59.421
what are you taking?

440
00:11:59.421 --> 00:12:02.290
So I tried it and I tried it in the first time I tried,

441
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:02.751
I was like,

442
00:12:02.751 --> 00:12:04.610
Holy Shit,

443
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.560
this is real.

444
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:07.483
Wow.

445
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.840
Cause it's not unlike coffee.

446
00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:09.381
Okay.

447
00:12:09.381 --> 00:12:10.700
And it's not like being high.

448
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.500
It's some weird thing,

449
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.280
some weird thing where you're like fucking sharp as Shit,

450
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.031
you know?

451
00:12:17.031 --> 00:12:20.720
And it lasts for like five or six hours and I only took a half of one of these

452
00:12:20.721 --> 00:12:21.410
little fuckers.

453
00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.130
It wasn't even like a full one and a I was,

454
00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.300
I was really shocked.

455
00:12:26.301 --> 00:12:28.160
And then the first thing I thought of is wow,

456
00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.550
now I know why people are reluctant to tell people about this stuff because

457
00:12:31.551 --> 00:12:32.690
there'll be eating it like candy.

458
00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:34.430
And that's exactly what you said.

459
00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:35.510
That's why I omitted it.

460
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.730
But and

461
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.580
<v 3>so pro vigil,</v>

462
00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.350
which is Modafinil,

463
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.390
I actually first heard about,

464
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:46.870
well before it became popular with say Ceos because sprinters,

465
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:51.871
we're using it Olympic sprinters and they were getting prescriptions and false

466
00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.490
diagnoses from doctors as narcoleptics because it was anti narcolepsy drug so

467
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:00.340
that if they got caught it could be inadvertent use and they'd be like,

468
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:01.900
but I'm a narcoleptic Olympic sprinter.

469
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:02.130
Like,

470
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:02.360
right.

471
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:02.600
Sure.

472
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.433
You are.

473
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.940
<v 2>Imagine that full sprint and then face the middle of a stride.</v>

474
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.170
<v 0>Greatest Olympics ever.</v>

475
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:13.770
They're like,

476
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.560
it would be like controversy because the guy takes modafinil.

477
00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:17.610
Does that actually help us?

478
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.971
Well,

479
00:13:17.971 --> 00:13:18.600
he needs it.

480
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.160
He has an arc elliptic we know it.

481
00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.180
We have footage of him from the 2014 games where he face planted.

482
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.400
<v 3>So there are different,</v>

483
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.270
this is a side note,

484
00:13:26.271 --> 00:13:30.640
but I've had enough shit in my system by now that I'll just digress at will be,

485
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:30.860
uh,

486
00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.740
have you ever seen the videos of narcoleptic goats that fall asleep?

487
00:13:33.741 --> 00:13:34.670
If they're startled,

488
00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.113
they're amazing.

489
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.170
They need more provincial.

490
00:13:39.171 --> 00:13:40.070
But the,

491
00:13:40.071 --> 00:13:40.904
uh,

492
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:44.810
I've been experimenting with a smart drugs which have been very hesitant to do,

493
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.040
uh,

494
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.820
for a long time because it's very seductive and easy to get hooked on them.

495
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.730
Provigil or fennel Prasad,

496
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.300
Tim,

497
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:53.600
uh,

498
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.600
press temps or the Ras at Tams or class of smart drugs really considered kind of

499
00:13:58.611 --> 00:13:59.930
the granddaddies of the category.

500
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.180
I never found pressed him to do much.

501
00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.600
I tried oxy asked him and harass temo number of derivatives,

502
00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:06.431
fennel,

503
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:06.790
prs,

504
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.230
tams 30 to 60 times more stimulatory.

505
00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:11.030
So it's popular with cyclists,

506
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:12.500
like Tour de France,

507
00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.423
cyclists.

508
00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:16.010
Did you ever try porosity them with Coleen?

509
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:16.880
Yep.

510
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:17.810
So this is the,

511
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.170
yeah,

512
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.471
this is,

513
00:14:18.471 --> 00:14:20.780
this is just as the key yet you need to combine it with Coleen.

514
00:14:20.781 --> 00:14:24.050
So when I've used fennel press tam recently,

515
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.220
I'd combine it with,

516
00:14:25.221 --> 00:14:26.054
with Coleen.

517
00:14:27.020 --> 00:14:27.701
What is the difference?

518
00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:28.520
So can you,

519
00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.270
can you describe it?

520
00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:29.431
How it's,

521
00:14:29.431 --> 00:14:30.470
cause I haven't done this,

522
00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:30.740
I just,

523
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:31.573
just what I've read,

524
00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.320
well it's,

525
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.240
I think that where people,

526
00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.410
and this is where the biological fleet for a free lunch or the myth thereof

527
00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.633
comes into play.

528
00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:42.290
If you're using a stimulant,

529
00:14:42.291 --> 00:14:45.800
say that is forcing your brain to burn,

530
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:48.020
given neurotransmitter's at a faster rate,

531
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.110
you're going to deplete your gas tank.

532
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.990
So you need a means to regenerate that.

533
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.480
And Coleen is,

534
00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.413
uh,

535
00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:58.670
along with other things,

536
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.500
it can be helpful for producing,

537
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:01.370
let's say acetylcholine.

538
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:02.860
And,

539
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.220
uh,

540
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.030
so that is why in many cases,

541
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:09.410
well this is one case where you're providing a precursor and then something like

542
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.400
fennel pressed him,

543
00:15:10.401 --> 00:15:12.320
which acts on culinary kick receptors.

544
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.110
You can also do that,

545
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.830
uh,

546
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.760
certainly with a different types of physical training.

547
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:21.170
So if you look at people who tip might take,

548
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:22.004
let's say,

549
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.940
uh,

550
00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.140
I'm trying to think of a good example.

551
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:24.470
Um,

552
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:25.241
thyroid hormone,

553
00:15:25.241 --> 00:15:28.670
like t three or any number of things.

554
00:15:28.671 --> 00:15:29.421
If you combine that,

555
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:30.590
then with higher protein intake,

556
00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.700
you're going to see better results,

557
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:32.560
right?

558
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.440
And it's very similar,

559
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:35.300
but you're just applying it to the organ of the brain.

560
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:36.170
Um,

561
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.310
other smart drugs to,

562
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:37.960
to,

563
00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.870
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

564
00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:42.560
but to keep the reserves from being depleted too badly,

565
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:45.100
you have to oversupply certainly.

566
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.700
At least you have to increase your supply.

567
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:47.880
Uh,

568
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.271
and what,

569
00:15:48.271 --> 00:15:48.430
what,

570
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:50.870
what specifically like in this case,

571
00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:54.800
Coleen is helping you to produce the neurotransmitters that are affected by the

572
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.420
drug that you're using.

573
00:15:56.421 --> 00:15:57.060
In this case,

574
00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.250
a federal Prasadam.

575
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:59.510
Uh,

576
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:02.990
I've fallen out of the loop with a lot of this,

577
00:16:02.991 --> 00:16:05.390
but got back into it because a friend of mine who's a,

578
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.020
he's a,

579
00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:11.020
he's a computer hacker who a lot like frank abignail from catch me if you can.

580
00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:16.780
He was basically told you can go to jail or you can help the government to

581
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:19.040
identify like a weaknesses in their systems.

582
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.090
And he's a,

583
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:20.751
he is a,

584
00:16:20.751 --> 00:16:21.200
uh,

585
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.210
an explorer of smart drugs.

586
00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:28.211
And he turned me on to specifically the combination of artichoke extract and

587
00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:34.790
Forskolin and these used in combination effect cyclical and p and all sorts of

588
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:35.421
things.

589
00:16:35.421 --> 00:16:36.254
But it,

590
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:37.190
yeah,

591
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:40.010
so this is something you can get over the counter that has very similar,

592
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.053
the by the,

593
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.220
the actual mechanism of action might be different,

594
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:46.640
but for me it gave a very similar effect to modafinil real,

595
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.690
the feeling itself.

596
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.380
The problem was that I needed 12 to 14 hours of sleep that night,

597
00:16:51.381 --> 00:16:52.460
or I couldn't function the next day.

598
00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.150
Wow.

599
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.810
Which tells me my body needs to regenerate something that I'm depleting clearly.

600
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.250
Uh,

601
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.083
the,

602
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.940
what I'd just like to point out to people who might be like,

603
00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:02.540
Holy Shit,

604
00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.520
let me order some stuff from some European pharmacies,

605
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:06.483
the podcast,

606
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.980
they're all the same before the podcast.

607
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:10.880
They're not going to listen to you.

608
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.721
I know they won't.

609
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:12.021
They won't,

610
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:12.741
but I'll tell you anyway,

611
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:13.574
which is,

612
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.340
I,

613
00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.340
I'm very conservative with taking some of these drugs that affect the brain,

614
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.020
particularly because if you look at medicine in general,

615
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.580
they're plenty of drugs that have been,

616
00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:26.090
uh,

617
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.100
had supposedly had no side effects.

618
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.650
Statens thalidomide for instance,

619
00:17:30.651 --> 00:17:33.560
which resulted in horrific birth defects that,

620
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:34.130
that,

621
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.410
that aren't seen or I should say,

622
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.330
concluded to have side effects until five,

623
00:17:38.331 --> 00:17:38.601
10,

624
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:39.434
15 years down the line.

625
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.330
So it's like whatever you do,

626
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.130
at the very least,

627
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.570
cycle off every once in a while,

628
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.130
especially for the mind.

629
00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:46.740
Right?

630
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.120
I mean,

631
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.920
the mind is such a tricky thing.

632
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.370
The,

633
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.310
it's so sensitive.

634
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:50.930
<v 0>It's you,</v>

635
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.350
are you aware of reequip?

636
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:53.643
No,

637
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.590
this is a great case.

638
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.450
They a Parkinson's medication.

639
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:57.930
Okay.

640
00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:00.630
That turned a guy into a gay sex addict.

641
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.090
He was completely straight with kids.

642
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:03.391
Okay.

643
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:07.930
One $600,000 from glaxosmithkline.

644
00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:08.190
Yeah.

645
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.240
So I mean that's a gigantic pharmaceutical company with pretty fucking bad ass

646
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:12.930
lawyers.

647
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:13.190
Okay.

648
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:18.190
So for this guy to actually go to court and win more than a half a million

649
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:22.470
dollars because they turned them into a gay sex and gambling addict.

650
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.440
You think though like he do you think he was alone but I can know what I wanted.

651
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:28.950
Combination.

652
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:29.400
Yeah.

653
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.480
Gambling case.

654
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.420
Wonder what else he didn't file for.

655
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.480
He was apparently just nuts for thrills.

656
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.530
Like he was like,

657
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.460
like anything like really fucked up are really crazy and dangerous.

658
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:42.750
So we put out like,

659
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:43.440
um,

660
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.090
like ads in like,

661
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:45.420
uh,

662
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.380
like papers,

663
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:47.041
like you know,

664
00:18:47.041 --> 00:18:47.581
the public,

665
00:18:47.581 --> 00:18:47.870
you know,

666
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:48.051
what are,

667
00:18:48.051 --> 00:18:50.460
what are those a meetup ads and hook up ads,

668
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:53.630
like Craig's list type thing and just was getting raped by guys.

669
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:55.131
I mean he,

670
00:18:55.131 --> 00:18:55.980
he was doing it.

671
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.903
I mean he like,

672
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.900
he was crazy.

673
00:18:57.901 --> 00:18:58.351
It was real.

674
00:18:58.351 --> 00:19:00.420
And he was gambling like couldn't stop gambling.

675
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:01.141
I mean,

676
00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:03.690
could you imagine you were regular fucking guy?

677
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.210
I have a little Parkinson's map docs,

678
00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:07.080
my hands shaking.

679
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:08.011
I don't know what to do.

680
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:08.551
Trust me.

681
00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:10.020
This is the medication for you.

682
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.380
We're going to give you this and you're going to be all fixed up and then all of

683
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:17.160
sudden he wakes up playing poker in a gay orgy sucking cocks.

684
00:19:17.161 --> 00:19:18.300
It throwing money on the table.

685
00:19:18.301 --> 00:19:20.060
I mean their clinic let that,

686
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.890
he probably didn't even know what he was doing.

687
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.580
That's the worst side effects ever.

688
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:27.440
Can you imagine the commercial make Mickey get butt raped by a bunch of million

689
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.480
and might make you suck cock and lose all your money?

690
00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.593
Talk to your doctor.

691
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.550
It's,

692
00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.890
I mean it's really a fascinating thing.

693
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.350
I've been trying to work it out on stage and talk about it,

694
00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:40.930
but it's,

695
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.250
it's so,

696
00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.700
it's so ridiculous that it doesn't even seem like it could be real.

697
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.470
Like the guy was a straight guy and he had two kids and then all of a sudden

698
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:51.450
he's a gambling and sex addict.

699
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.400
He said he was in gay orgies and shit.

700
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:55.460
He was playing play,

701
00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.050
placing ads and like come fuck me.

702
00:19:58.140 --> 00:19:59.490
You know like who wants to hook up?

703
00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:01.560
And he would go play some catch,

704
00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.370
just punch him and fuck him through.

705
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:05.580
It's like a regular guy.

706
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.830
And the idea is that the,

707
00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:09.360
you know,

708
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.460
the powerful medication,

709
00:20:11.461 --> 00:20:16.260
like something to treat Parkinson's somehow or another goes down the wrong alley

710
00:20:16.261 --> 00:20:17.850
of the mind and says,

711
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:18.241
oh,

712
00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:18.871
well let's look,

713
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:20.550
because we're going to shut this off.

714
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.750
Let's fucking turn this.

715
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:22.710
What are these over here?

716
00:20:22.711 --> 00:20:23.544
What are these do?

717
00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:23.761
Oh,

718
00:20:23.761 --> 00:20:25.950
this is this the one that makes you love cock.

719
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.330
Let's hit that and see what he does.

720
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:29.221
Yeah,

721
00:20:29.221 --> 00:20:29.580
man.

722
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.091
Just say no.

723
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:31.140
Kids just say no.

724
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.000
Say No to reequip.

725
00:20:33.001 --> 00:20:33.331
By the way,

726
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:36.900
you know what else works for Parkinson's marijuana and that's illegal.

727
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.550
But that reequip shit.

728
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.390
You can go get it tomorrow.

729
00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:43.770
I think they took it off the market.

730
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.990
I think once you lose a big one like that,

731
00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:46.830
you'd probably go,

732
00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:47.350
oh,

733
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.183
okay.

734
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:49.570
<v 1>It might be something to this.</v>

735
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.530
So to avoid,

736
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.980
right,

737
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:51.791
to avoid the,

738
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:52.624
uh,

739
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:53.503
if it's not your thing,

740
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.120
the gay orgies magic.

741
00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:55.990
If it works on everybody,

742
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.900
imagine if all the other dudes that have Parkinson's,

743
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:02.620
we just keeping their mouth shut and this guy was the only guy I'll just fucking

744
00:21:02.621 --> 00:21:03.880
getting raped to gamble.

745
00:21:03.881 --> 00:21:04.480
I was money.

746
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.720
All the other guys had Parkinson.

747
00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:07.090
So like I thought it was just a loser.

748
00:21:07.091 --> 00:21:10.270
All of a sudden I thought it was a crazy gay loser.

749
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.130
Stick to the coconut oil and creatine.

750
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.420
Maybe like all of the people who took this [inaudible] sex junkies.

751
00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:17.890
The rest of them just fought it off.

752
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:18.753
No,

753
00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.020
no,

754
00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:21.380
no gay sex.

755
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:23.440
This guy was just like,

756
00:21:23.441 --> 00:21:24.070
fuck it,

757
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.180
let's just do this.

758
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.010
I just go with my feelings,

759
00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:27.431
man.

760
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:27.701
You know,

761
00:21:27.701 --> 00:21:28.780
I trust my spirit.

762
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.010
Rolling dice and blonde dudes.

763
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.760
Meanwhile I was just the drugs all along.

764
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:41.850
So this artichoke extract or took extract plus forskolin.

765
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.320
That's what Coleus forskohlii and

766
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:49.270
exactly what a stupid name for a drug that you want to take serious.

767
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.621
And I was like,

768
00:21:50.621 --> 00:21:52.360
you couldn't make another noise with your mouth.

769
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.010
You have to make it sound like for skin,

770
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:55.650
you know?

771
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.483
It's like the word,

772
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.580
the word niggardly,

773
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.270
you know,

774
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:00.640
that's like an actual word that means stingy.

775
00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:01.421
You know?

776
00:22:01.421 --> 00:22:03.610
It's like if someone got in trouble for using it,

777
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.250
a guy got,

778
00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.250
I check you in a college in the east coast for using it and they,

779
00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.990
I guess they thought he was a smart ass because it's not really in the public

780
00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:13.900
vernacular anymore and we kind of know what it,

781
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.030
what it really sounds like,

782
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.910
but the fact is it's actually a word,

783
00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.653
you know,

784
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.820
please.

785
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:22.010
Yeah,

786
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.271
just,

787
00:22:22.271 --> 00:22:23.350
it's just too close.

788
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.393
It's just,

789
00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:25.623
sorry.

790
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.950
You know you can't use it,

791
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.150
but it's a different word.

792
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.480
It doesn't matter but doesn't work with some things.

793
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:31.841
You know,

794
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:33.160
like you can say pussy cat,

795
00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:35.001
you can get a bit of pussy,

796
00:22:35.001 --> 00:22:35.710
cat,

797
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.981
pussy,

798
00:22:35.981 --> 00:22:36.280
cat.

799
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.240
I love my pussy cat.

800
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.343
Pussy cat.

801
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:38.710
Yeah.

802
00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.800
See that's when you start getting sketchy when you're talking about wet pussy

803
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:42.653
catalysis.

804
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.910
Yeah.

805
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:43.451
I'm going to go,

806
00:22:43.451 --> 00:22:45.880
I'm going to go put my hand on my wet pussy cat.

807
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.393
See,

808
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.780
you got your,

809
00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:49.840
you're crossing the line.

810
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:50.501
You know you're,

811
00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:51.130
you're getting,

812
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.120
you're getting graphic,

813
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.401
but you know what I mean.

814
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:54.731
It's like,

815
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:55.750
you can say that word,

816
00:22:55.751 --> 00:22:57.520
but fuck doesn't exist anywhere.

817
00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.120
You can't,

818
00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.300
you can't stick that in there.

819
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.630
He can't say unfucking believable and everybody goes,

820
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:01.961
oh yeah,

821
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:03.320
but it's in the middle of all that other stuff.

822
00:23:03.321 --> 00:23:04.154
That's okay.

823
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.840
Like pussy cat fuck is one of the most flexible words in the English language.

824
00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.460
It's also replaces the word,

825
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:10.343
uh,

826
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.253
a lot,

827
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.333
uh,

828
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:13.090
uh,

829
00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.230
fucking fucking guy.

830
00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.990
But there's a right way to do it.

831
00:23:16.991 --> 00:23:17.420
Right?

832
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.820
It's like unfucking believable,

833
00:23:18.821 --> 00:23:20.530
but you can't say unbelievable fucking bowling.

834
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:20.931
It doesn't work.

835
00:23:20.931 --> 00:23:21.520
Yeah.

836
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:21.881
There's a,

837
00:23:21.881 --> 00:23:23.170
there's actually a little book,

838
00:23:23.171 --> 00:23:26.380
it's like 80 pages long called English as a second fucking language and it talks

839
00:23:26.381 --> 00:23:29.960
about the grammar of using the word fuck curse words and fucking whatnot.

840
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:31.450
It's very important.

841
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.811
I mean,

842
00:23:31.811 --> 00:23:32.501
as a comedian,

843
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:34.450
one of the things that I learned early on,

844
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.060
um,

845
00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.730
starting out in Boston especially,

846
00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.290
they were very cognizant about the rhythm of comedy and the use of the word fuck

847
00:23:41.291 --> 00:23:42.700
that if you over fucked,

848
00:23:42.701 --> 00:23:43.960
like have you used it too much,

849
00:23:43.961 --> 00:23:45.980
it would ruin your set and it would ruin that

850
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.270
<v 0>word for the rest of the evening.</v>

851
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:48.411
And so like,

852
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:49.370
when a guy would go up,

853
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:50.450
like me sucked,

854
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.010
I used the word fuck too much.

855
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.311
You know,

856
00:23:52.311 --> 00:23:53.390
when I was in the beginning,

857
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.480
I would get like a lecture by one of the older guys who've been around for

858
00:23:56.481 --> 00:23:56.780
awhile.

859
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.200
Like,

860
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.621
well kid,

861
00:23:57.621 --> 00:24:00.320
you can use the word fuck but don't say fuck every other word.

862
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:03.860
But the idea is when you say you mean it's your throat and they'll be like,

863
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:04.723
oh okay.

864
00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:05.780
So these guys,

865
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.321
you know,

866
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:07.430
and being comedians,

867
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:09.620
they were basically craftsmen with the English language.

868
00:24:09.621 --> 00:24:10.311
I mean they were allowed,

869
00:24:10.311 --> 00:24:11.780
a lot of them were blue collar guys.

870
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:12.831
A lot of them were,

871
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:13.460
you know,

872
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:16.400
they would have been carpenters if they weren't comedians,

873
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.230
but as Comedians,

874
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:23.260
the way they approached the craft of saying things sort of re re categorize the,

875
00:24:24.171 --> 00:24:25.730
the idea of swear words to me.

876
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.130
Cause before it was just a natural thing to use them.

877
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.600
And I didn't realize how clunky my language was until I started doing standup

878
00:24:32.601 --> 00:24:33.434
comedy.

879
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.520
If I remember,

880
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.650
<v 3>I got really annoyed with myself for overusing the word pretty like oh that's</v>

881
00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:40.130
pretty good.

882
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.791
Oh it's pretty nice.

883
00:24:40.791 --> 00:24:41.391
I feel pretty good.

884
00:24:41.391 --> 00:24:42.530
I feel I got really annoyed.

885
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:42.980
But for,

886
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.880
for overusing that?

887
00:24:43.881 --> 00:24:44.001
No,

888
00:24:44.001 --> 00:24:44.241
I just,

889
00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:44.511
I'm just like,

890
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:47.690
it's so fucking lazy then I use this all the time.

891
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:52.040
So I decided that I would cure myself of it by forcing myself in any company if

892
00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:53.990
I use the word pretty to say fucking after.

893
00:24:53.991 --> 00:24:55.970
So that's pretty fucking expensive.

894
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.220
[inaudible] I stopped,

895
00:24:58.221 --> 00:24:58.881
I stopped.

896
00:24:58.881 --> 00:25:00.220
It was tick that I had to hear it,

897
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.110
but I wanted to ask you when you're working on your material,

898
00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:05.590
because I become kind of fascinated by standup,

899
00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.070
uh,

900
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.903
how do you,

901
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:09.710
how do you work on writing your material out?

902
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:10.460
Does it longhand?

903
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.470
Is it just notes and then he tried to piece it together?

904
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:13.310
Like at what point,

905
00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.330
at what point are you done enough with the material to actually get up and try

906
00:25:18.331 --> 00:25:19.310
to put it in practice?

907
00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:20.800
<v 0>I do it in two separate ways.</v>

908
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.830
I do either directly or indirectly.

909
00:25:23.831 --> 00:25:28.831
And by indirectly I write a blog entry and then writing a blog entry and it

910
00:25:28.901 --> 00:25:31.120
might start off with a,

911
00:25:31.121 --> 00:25:31.391
you know,

912
00:25:31.391 --> 00:25:33.370
something about food,

913
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:33.911
you know,

914
00:25:33.911 --> 00:25:36.790
and then somewhere along the line it becomes something crazy.

915
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.510
Then I'll go in and cherry pick the craziness and the silliness and stuff that

916
00:25:40.511 --> 00:25:41.081
makes me laugh.

917
00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:42.130
It just comes out of nowhere.

918
00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.530
And then I feel like,

919
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.091
and then I take that,

920
00:25:46.091 --> 00:25:49.090
extract it and put it into another file and then that those become like

921
00:25:49.091 --> 00:25:51.340
potential material ideas for beds.

922
00:25:51.341 --> 00:25:53.260
But I feel like you have to,

923
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:56.440
one of the most important things about coming up with stuff,

924
00:25:56.441 --> 00:25:58.270
especially when you're like under the gun,

925
00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.500
is you have to show up.

926
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.430
You have to be there and you have to just put in enough time staring at that

927
00:26:03.431 --> 00:26:06.850
screen and writing and just know that some of it is not going to be that good.

928
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:09.970
Some of it is going to be just noise and then boom,

929
00:26:09.971 --> 00:26:13.090
you hit a vein and then you hit that vein and you might be able to ride that

930
00:26:13.091 --> 00:26:14.050
vein for hours.

931
00:26:14.051 --> 00:26:14.831
And then it just,

932
00:26:14.831 --> 00:26:15.131
it just,

933
00:26:15.131 --> 00:26:20.131
you have these new unique ideas that they weren't going to come unless you gave

934
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.390
massive amount of consideration to the idea.

935
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.320
And the problem with just sitting around trying to come up with ideas on your

936
00:26:26.321 --> 00:26:26.501
own,

937
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:27.221
driving in your car,

938
00:26:27.221 --> 00:26:30.460
like that is one way and sometimes you get things that way,

939
00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:34.270
but when you're sitting in front of a computer and that's all you're doing,

940
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.620
you're just trying,

941
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.840
or a notepad if you like Longhand,

942
00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.211
when you're,

943
00:26:39.211 --> 00:26:41.410
you're actually just thinking about something,

944
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.070
then you're allowing the mind go off and all these little

945
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.903
<v 1>branches.</v>

946
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.570
Yeah,

947
00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:49.710
so there's a lot of guys who don't write like in front of a computer or on a

948
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:49.981
pad,

949
00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:52.110
the only come up with their material on stage.

950
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.160
They have ideas and they take those ideas and they'd go on stage them and then

951
00:26:56.161 --> 00:26:57.360
that becomes like a form.

952
00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.100
Once they figured out how to do it right,

953
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.140
then that becomes like the bit,

954
00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:05.220
and then Zach does that required just a tremendous amount of,

955
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:09.000
of sort of natural gift in the same way that an athlete could go out and

956
00:27:09.001 --> 00:27:13.410
improvise without training in the sense that someone who has such a fast mental

957
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:18.411
turnover that they can improvise on stage and make it entertaining even when

958
00:27:18.481 --> 00:27:19.500
it's completely,

959
00:27:19.501 --> 00:27:21.990
and it's a sort of fetal stage.

960
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:22.650
You,

961
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:23.251
you sorta,

962
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:27.090
but you don't even try it unless you think there's something there and there's

963
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:30.180
gotta be something there for you and you kind of recognize it and they're not

964
00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.014
all gyms.

965
00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:31.230
Right.

966
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:31.410
You know,

967
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:33.220
sometimes there's bits that have done that,

968
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:34.250
you know,

969
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.710
they might've worked once and they didn't work a second time or they didn't work

970
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:38.544
as well,

971
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:39.600
or there's something off.

972
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.160
So I pull it out of the lineup and I go,

973
00:27:41.161 --> 00:27:41.461
you know,

974
00:27:41.461 --> 00:27:43.260
and put you over here until I figure you out.

975
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.840
And then I'd go back to them and sometimes I'll go,

976
00:27:45.841 --> 00:27:46.070
I'll,

977
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.371
I'll,

978
00:27:46.371 --> 00:27:47.970
I'll take them out of the lineup for a year.

979
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:50.640
You know it's have a text file that you put that into?

980
00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:51.390
Sometimes.

981
00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:52.111
Sometimes not.

982
00:27:52.111 --> 00:27:55.020
Sometimes it's just in my memory there's certain bits that I'd never,

983
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:58.500
I've never written down because they came to me on stage and then I just carried

984
00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:00.760
them on to the next and then they'll,

985
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:01.920
they'll grow to,

986
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.191
yeah.

987
00:28:02.191 --> 00:28:03.060
Sometimes I forget them.

988
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:03.450
Yeah.

989
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.750
That's the words you think of the best new bit on stage and you just forget

990
00:28:06.930 --> 00:28:07.230
about it.

991
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:08.760
Well that's why I record all my sets.

992
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.660
I always forget that they even listen to that,

993
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.250
but I don't know.

994
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:12.990
I don't forget that every single one.

995
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.201
Yeah,

996
00:28:13.201 --> 00:28:13.980
you have to,

997
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:14.850
it's part of the job.

998
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:15.600
You have to,

999
00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.130
you have to be a professional.

1000
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.421
There's,

1001
00:28:17.421 --> 00:28:20.790
there's certain aspects of being a comedian that you have to be a professional

1002
00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:21.091
at.

1003
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:22.620
One of them is you have to listen to sets.

1004
00:28:22.621 --> 00:28:25.370
If I have a new bit in the new bit came out in the set,

1005
00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.640
I listened to it and it's easy to do because I,

1006
00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.870
my Bluetooth phone hooks up to my car so I'm driving home.

1007
00:28:30.871 --> 00:28:34.920
I said is on my phone cause he used the voice memos for iTunes.

1008
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.730
It's fine.

1009
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:36.270
I can hear it.

1010
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:37.260
Oh I need to do is hear it.

1011
00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:37.650
Right.

1012
00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:41.730
So that's in my car and I'm driving home and instead of like just playing music

1013
00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:42.660
and dicking around,

1014
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.070
I can go over the new material.

1015
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:44.741
So I'll,

1016
00:28:44.741 --> 00:28:45.061
I'll go,

1017
00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:45.310
okay.

1018
00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:48.870
That maybe that'd be better if I did it that way first or switch this around or

1019
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:51.540
maybe it needs more of an explanation and maybe it's too verbose.

1020
00:28:51.541 --> 00:28:52.680
And so I'll get to,

1021
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.760
if you don't do that,

1022
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:55.740
I feel like you're not doing the whole job.

1023
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.180
Do you,

1024
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:57.571
do you,

1025
00:28:57.571 --> 00:28:57.810
uh,

1026
00:28:57.810 --> 00:28:59.340
are there any particular comics?

1027
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:00.690
Do you say comics or Comedians?

1028
00:29:00.691 --> 00:29:01.524
Comics.

1029
00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.550
I don't think it's,

1030
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:03.383
who gives a shit.

1031
00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:04.080
I don't care.

1032
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.050
I'm just wondering if there's some weird into some guy's website and it said a

1033
00:29:07.051 --> 00:29:07.980
comedian is of this,

1034
00:29:07.981 --> 00:29:08.970
but a common cause of that.

1035
00:29:08.971 --> 00:29:09.230
I'm like,

1036
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.063
okay,

1037
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:10.650
yeah,

1038
00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:11.490
I'm a comedian,

1039
00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:12.121
but I'm also,

1040
00:29:12.121 --> 00:29:13.050
I'm a standup comic.

1041
00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:15.000
I either wanted to fuck you know what you do,

1042
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.920
what are we crazy?

1043
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.470
Oh I'm just speaking for myself.

1044
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:19.711
But no,

1045
00:29:19.711 --> 00:29:19.901
I mean,

1046
00:29:19.901 --> 00:29:20.970
I mean it's a weird thing.

1047
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:21.900
It's a weird thing,

1048
00:29:21.901 --> 00:29:22.621
but people are,

1049
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:23.910
people are obsessed with that.

1050
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:29.720
Is there anyone who stands out as having a really consistent process to you?

1051
00:29:30.901 --> 00:29:31.680
I guess Louie.

1052
00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.360
Louie CK.

1053
00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:32.610
Louie.

1054
00:29:32.610 --> 00:29:32.761
Yeah.

1055
00:29:32.761 --> 00:29:33.930
He's very inspiring to me.

1056
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:35.191
It makes me,

1057
00:29:35.191 --> 00:29:35.640
um,

1058
00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.640
it makes me hustle because he's like really obsessed with work.

1059
00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.620
It's really obsessed with getting things done.

1060
00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:40.861
You know,

1061
00:29:40.861 --> 00:29:41.230
he,

1062
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.940
he does a whole new hour every year,

1063
00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:43.774
like religiously.

1064
00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:45.280
That's like really cool.

1065
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.560
It's,

1066
00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:45.841
it's,

1067
00:29:45.841 --> 00:29:46.960
it's inspiring,

1068
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.411
you know?

1069
00:29:47.411 --> 00:29:48.310
And it makes you a,

1070
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.090
I'm really,

1071
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.810
I've really loved stand up and to this day I'm,

1072
00:29:51.811 --> 00:29:52.644
I'm really,

1073
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.010
I'm a huge fan of it,

1074
00:29:54.011 --> 00:29:54.550
you know?

1075
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:55.750
Even if I never did it again.

1076
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.470
Yeah.

1077
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.951
Like if I said,

1078
00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:57.281
you know what?

1079
00:29:57.281 --> 00:29:57.611
Stand ups,

1080
00:29:57.611 --> 00:29:59.800
too much work as podcasts is easy.

1081
00:29:59.801 --> 00:30:01.060
The UFC is pretty easy.

1082
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:01.511
You know,

1083
00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:01.811
these are,

1084
00:30:01.811 --> 00:30:03.220
these are much easier gigs and stand up.

1085
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:04.240
I'm just going to quit this shit.

1086
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.190
I would still watch it all the time.

1087
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:06.760
I love it.

1088
00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.800
I love seeing a guy who was really funny,

1089
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:12.280
just unique ideas that I didn't think of.

1090
00:30:12.281 --> 00:30:12.791
I love it.

1091
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:13.031
I just,

1092
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:13.270
it's,

1093
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.640
it's to me as a fan,

1094
00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:16.600
um,

1095
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.750
it's my favorite art form to,

1096
00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:19.570
to enjoy,

1097
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:20.141
even though I,

1098
00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:20.980
that's what I do.

1099
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.350
It's still my favorite art form to actually enjoy it.

1100
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.373
I would always,

1101
00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.730
I love when I ended up seeing,

1102
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.870
I actually saw Louie when he was working on some material and sag harbor at this

1103
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:32.704
tiny,

1104
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.510
it's a bay street theater and the audience and maybe 100 people and that was

1105
00:30:37.511 --> 00:30:42.511
awesome to watch to see somebody who's really well known working on their stuff

1106
00:30:42.791 --> 00:30:43.630
in a smaller setting.

1107
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.830
That was really,

1108
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.490
it's fun for me to see people work through the tough stuff,

1109
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:48.780
you know?

1110
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.613
Yeah.

1111
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:50.860
Well there's a lot of bits,

1112
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:51.340
like a,

1113
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.510
Chris rock had a bit,

1114
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:53.500
um,

1115
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:54.970
that he did for,

1116
00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.800
he said he did it for like a year.

1117
00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:00.610
Louie told me the story actually before it worked and it bombed for a long time.

1118
00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:01.031
It was his,

1119
00:31:01.031 --> 00:31:02.080
one of his classics.

1120
00:31:02.081 --> 00:31:02.291
The,

1121
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:03.310
I love black people,

1122
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:04.720
but I hate niggers right up there.

1123
00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:05.290
Right.

1124
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.420
That's a call Lassek Chris rock bit.

1125
00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:07.541
I mean,

1126
00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:10.240
it's one of the best bits I think in the history of comedy.

1127
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.350
I mean it's just so,

1128
00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.990
it's so genius and controversial.

1129
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.160
It's got an edge to it.

1130
00:31:15.161 --> 00:31:15.791
It's got everything.

1131
00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:18.130
It does everything you want and like a great classic bit.

1132
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.270
It's every punch lines.

1133
00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:19.811
Perfect.

1134
00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:20.920
It's just a genius bit.

1135
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.460
He said bomb for a long time before he figured out how to do it.

1136
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:25.540
You know,

1137
00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:28.830
I had a bit that I did early on in my career about um,

1138
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:31.960
watching tigers fuck on the discovery channel,

1139
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.290
but they had a documentary wants and then just show it to you on television and

1140
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:37.210
you don't realize how pathetic you are,

1141
00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:39.850
how physically pathetic you are until you watch wild animals.

1142
00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:40.683
Fuck.

1143
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.720
Because it's like the wild giant Predator fuck.

1144
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.531
And the,

1145
00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:45.160
the um,

1146
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.210
the female tiger,

1147
00:31:46.211 --> 00:31:46.871
when it's in heat,

1148
00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:47.700
the male can mate.

1149
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:52.700
There was many times it's 50 in a day and so they show these tigers like he'd

1150
00:31:52.901 --> 00:31:57.080
been fucking for the 30th time and he bites her deck and he's just,

1151
00:31:57.081 --> 00:32:02.081
just her and she's roaring and snapping back at him and swatting him each

1152
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.260
fucking the shit out of him.

1153
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:06.370
And it makes you just completely want to quit having sex.

1154
00:32:06.371 --> 00:32:06.820
Like,

1155
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:07.930
how can I compete with this?

1156
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.940
And that bit was like my,

1157
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.770
it was the death of me.

1158
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.950
I would try to work it out and I would do it in the middle of my set and they

1159
00:32:14.951 --> 00:32:16.360
would just eat shit.

1160
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:18.400
They would just call rash.

1161
00:32:18.401 --> 00:32:19.300
It would just bomb,

1162
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:20.470
it would ruin the whole set.

1163
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:22.150
And then I'd have to pull myself out of it.

1164
00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.940
And it took me forever to figure out how to do it.

1165
00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.940
I don't know what happened that made me figure out how to do it.

1166
00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:31.060
But one day I just got it right and then I couldn't follow it.

1167
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.650
So it had to become my closer,

1168
00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.381
excuse me.

1169
00:32:35.381 --> 00:32:36.040
Bless you.

1170
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:36.700
Thank you.

1171
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:37.550
But um,

1172
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:39.920
that was a bit that I couldn't top forever.

1173
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:40.020
And

1174
00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:40.821
<v 0>then when I let it go,</v>

1175
00:32:40.821 --> 00:32:42.680
it was like I was losing like my best friend.

1176
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.080
The pit was a destroyer.

1177
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.870
It was,

1178
00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.390
it was just couldn't be stopped.

1179
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:47.840
It was,

1180
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.420
it was the patheticness of man with,

1181
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:52.280
and I became the tiger on stage.

1182
00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:52.851
I mean there's,

1183
00:32:52.851 --> 00:32:53.150
it's,

1184
00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:53.451
you know,

1185
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:54.620
what a good sound system.

1186
00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:58.490
You can make some crazy fucking tiger noises with a in a chair.

1187
00:32:58.491 --> 00:32:59.271
And I was fucking this shit.

1188
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:00.800
It wasn't like the greatest bit have ever come up with,

1189
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.480
it was a distracter.

1190
00:33:02.481 --> 00:33:03.260
It was just,

1191
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:03.501
there's,

1192
00:33:03.501 --> 00:33:04.910
as far as like a closing bit,

1193
00:33:04.911 --> 00:33:06.800
it was like the perfect closing bit.

1194
00:33:06.801 --> 00:33:07.970
It took a lot of fucking work.

1195
00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.220
Took forever and it ain't shit.

1196
00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:15.020
For the longest time I couldn't figure out the right way to express it to

1197
00:33:15.021 --> 00:33:15.800
people.

1198
00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:16.230
I couldn't.

1199
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:18.260
There was a lot of people that didn't want to hear about what,

1200
00:33:18.261 --> 00:33:19.490
how you would like to fuck.

1201
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:20.090
Okay.

1202
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.220
And you have to open them up to that idea.

1203
00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.940
It's not like you can't just go on stage and you know that you can,

1204
00:33:25.941 --> 00:33:26.870
if the people know you,

1205
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:29.150
but you can't just for the most part go on stage.

1206
00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:30.770
And he'd start talking about fucking,

1207
00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:31.611
because they're like,

1208
00:33:31.611 --> 00:33:31.731
well,

1209
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:34.810
who are you and why am I listening to your sex habits like you,

1210
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:39.650
you have to somehow or another open them up to your unique way of thinking and

1211
00:33:39.651 --> 00:33:41.180
they accept you into their mind.

1212
00:33:41.181 --> 00:33:43.010
And then you can talk about fucking,

1213
00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:43.881
you know,

1214
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:48.881
and that took me a long time to figure out that the people had to accept the

1215
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:51.950
fact that you are going to drive this conversation,

1216
00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.620
which is what happens when someone does stand up.

1217
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.011
You're,

1218
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:55.251
you're,

1219
00:33:55.251 --> 00:34:00.251
you're accepting the fact that they're going to take your mind on this journey

1220
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:02.140
of imagination and,

1221
00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.060
and taking you into places that you didn't expect to go to.

1222
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:08.440
You will laugh because they will take you a long familiar pass,

1223
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.230
but then exposed to things that you maybe thought that only you saw and then

1224
00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:14.930
take you places where you didn't expect and you're going to laugh hilariously.

1225
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:19.670
But if the guide leads you on a shit path and the path is all clunky and he's

1226
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:20.504
all like,

1227
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.340
he's got a lot of iga or he's a,

1228
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:24.460
you don't want to hear him talk or you know,

1229
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:27.350
there's something wrong with the way he's perceiving himself as opposed to where

1230
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:30.200
other people are perceiving them and it's glaringly obvious and what he's saying

1231
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.250
then you know,

1232
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.590
then nobody wants to hear you talk about fucking dude.

1233
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:34.041
Okay,

1234
00:34:34.041 --> 00:34:34.874
we don't want to hear it.

1235
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:37.160
And so that was really my problem.

1236
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:38.630
But part of what my problem was,

1237
00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:40.190
I wasn't that good of a comedian yet.

1238
00:34:40.390 --> 00:34:41.930
Like I had a good idea,

1239
00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:42.771
but I wasn't,

1240
00:34:42.771 --> 00:34:43.850
I was clunky.

1241
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.100
I would make these above.

1242
00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.850
It was like a guy who knew how to punch really hard,

1243
00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:47.840
but I don't know how to box.

1244
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.170
Right.

1245
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:48.441
You know,

1246
00:34:48.441 --> 00:34:51.530
it's like you could get in there if it could figure out how to do it,

1247
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.420
but you can't always figure out how to do it.

1248
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.930
And so it became a craft issue,

1249
00:34:56.931 --> 00:35:00.050
became an issue of learning that the what,

1250
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:04.220
what the actual relationship between the performer and the audience is very much

1251
00:35:04.221 --> 00:35:05.510
like a massive gnosis.

1252
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:07.460
Yeah,

1253
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.510
that's what it's very much like,

1254
00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:14.360
I saw a documentary recently that had been recommended to me a million times and

1255
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:15.530
I'd always intended to watch it,

1256
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:16.190
but it was,

1257
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.001
for whatever reason,

1258
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:18.320
always put on the back burner.

1259
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:20.420
And I don't know how it's been received in the comedy world,

1260
00:35:20.421 --> 00:35:21.980
but the comedian with the track,

1261
00:35:21.981 --> 00:35:26.690
Jerry Seinfeld and loved it an up and comer contrast in styles with the most

1262
00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:28.040
brilliant aspect of that,

1263
00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:32.690
that documentary is that he put that other dude in to make them look bad because

1264
00:35:32.691 --> 00:35:33.290
he know the dude,

1265
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:34.400
he knew the dude was a freak.

1266
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.911
So it was like,

1267
00:35:34.911 --> 00:35:35.470
listen,

1268
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.040
I'm gonna I know I'm a little fucked up.

1269
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.080
What I'll do is put

1270
00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.240
<v 1>some of their more fucked up than me.</v>

1271
00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.120
And so what was the other cat's name?

1272
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:44.890
I can't remember.

1273
00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:45.723
Let's pull it up.

1274
00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.890
It's Adams.

1275
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.590
That's right.

1276
00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.423
40 items.

1277
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.141
So you know,

1278
00:35:49.141 --> 00:35:51.360
I thought and they use like a lot of like,

1279
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.343
you know,

1280
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.760
do she shit.

1281
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:56.100
That may be a young man might say and then they gave it up to,

1282
00:35:56.101 --> 00:35:56.821
they stuck a camera.

1283
00:35:56.821 --> 00:35:57.031
So He's,

1284
00:35:57.031 --> 00:35:57.340
why would,

1285
00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.320
why did they choose him?

1286
00:35:58.321 --> 00:35:58.981
Why did they choose him?

1287
00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:01.470
Why didn't they choose like one of the better comics in New York?

1288
00:36:01.471 --> 00:36:02.040
Like what,

1289
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:02.880
for what reason?

1290
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:03.803
I don't know.

1291
00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:05.610
To make Jerry look better.

1292
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.421
That's what they did.

1293
00:36:06.421 --> 00:36:08.370
They knew that kid was crazy and they're like,

1294
00:36:08.371 --> 00:36:09.360
I know we're going to do here.

1295
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.901
We're gonna,

1296
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:10.520
we're gonna,

1297
00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:10.801
you know,

1298
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:12.600
we don't want to put Jerry next to Chris Rock.

1299
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:12.871
Don't,

1300
00:36:12.871 --> 00:36:15.420
don't like follow Chris around because Chris is process.

1301
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.440
Looks like more fun.

1302
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.710
Let's get Jerry with someone who's really neurotic and it was really young and

1303
00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:23.040
this probably never had a camera in front of them before and let's,

1304
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:23.371
you know,

1305
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:25.830
talk about personal shit with them and ask him about his career.

1306
00:36:25.831 --> 00:36:28.790
And you know like especially when you're starting out like you're,

1307
00:36:28.791 --> 00:36:31.090
you're the idea of even having a career.

1308
00:36:31.091 --> 00:36:32.730
It was such an obsession.

1309
00:36:32.731 --> 00:36:33.031
It's like,

1310
00:36:33.031 --> 00:36:33.331
God,

1311
00:36:33.331 --> 00:36:34.051
I got to make it.

1312
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:34.630
I have to.

1313
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:38.340
And almost anyone who gets through the salmon ladder of standup comedy,

1314
00:36:38.341 --> 00:36:39.960
you have to be crazy and obsessed.

1315
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.290
Yeah.

1316
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:43.950
I just thought that it was really rude to take someone who's crazy and obsessed

1317
00:36:43.951 --> 00:36:44.460
like orange,

1318
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.480
which we all are in the beginning and focus the camera on him in direct contrast

1319
00:36:48.481 --> 00:36:53.010
to someone who's a multi-multi multimillionaire with a hundred Porsche's who's

1320
00:36:53.011 --> 00:36:58.011
trying to go back out to his loving throngs of millions of fans with some new

1321
00:36:58.021 --> 00:36:58.854
material.

1322
00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:00.060
So it was total one.

1323
00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.960
Where's the young wacky guys trying to make it and you're sticking a camera in

1324
00:37:03.961 --> 00:37:05.820
his face and then the other one,

1325
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:08.040
either you're falling one cherry fucking Seinfeld,

1326
00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:08.821
you know,

1327
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:11.940
but that wacky guy makes Jerry Seinfeld look awful good.

1328
00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:13.290
I mean it was,

1329
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.153
no,

1330
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.300
that's completely fair.

1331
00:37:15.301 --> 00:37:20.301
I think that it was though still a pretty fascinating discussion of the creative

1332
00:37:20.851 --> 00:37:21.301
process.

1333
00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:22.560
Even if you're not a comic.

1334
00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:23.790
Like for me as a writer,

1335
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:24.990
I loved seeing,

1336
00:37:24.991 --> 00:37:29.480
you know Colin Quinn and Chris Rock and Seinfeld and I think Louis was in there,

1337
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:31.800
a bunch of guys just talking about the process,

1338
00:37:31.801 --> 00:37:34.800
the fuck ups working on the difficult to material when you know there's a gym

1339
00:37:34.801 --> 00:37:34.951
there.

1340
00:37:34.951 --> 00:37:35.491
But like you said,

1341
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:37.230
like you have a feature but you don't have a product,

1342
00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:37.441
you're like,

1343
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:37.861
fuck,

1344
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:39.990
like if I can make this work but it can't work on its own.

1345
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.880
And how you battle that.

1346
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:43.620
And I remember reading,

1347
00:37:43.621 --> 00:37:44.640
I read a lot of,

1348
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.431
I'm sorry,

1349
00:37:45.431 --> 00:37:48.690
I read a lot of books on fiction writing even though I don't write fiction

1350
00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:53.130
because fiction writers have to battle more demons than nonfiction writers.

1351
00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:53.670
They just get,

1352
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.920
they get trapped in their heads more than nonfiction writers.

1353
00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.500
And I thought there was something to be learned there.

1354
00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.990
And one of the lessons I took from,

1355
00:38:00.991 --> 00:38:03.960
I think it was letters from a fiction writer or letters to a young fiction

1356
00:38:03.961 --> 00:38:04.794
writer,

1357
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:09.390
collection of letters from really experienced pros to people who are just

1358
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:10.224
finding their feet.

1359
00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:12.760
And one of them was effectively like,

1360
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:17.160
you think you've wasted 10 pages when the first good paragraph comes,

1361
00:38:17.161 --> 00:38:17.911
10 pages in,

1362
00:38:17.911 --> 00:38:21.960
but it's not a waste because you needed those first 10 of shitty pages of warmup

1363
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.760
to get to that one paragraph.

1364
00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.450
And uh,

1365
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.370
I just found it,

1366
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:30.900
I found it really helpful for actually finishing up for our chef.

1367
00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.160
I watched the comedian because I was,

1368
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:33.600
I was stuck and I was like,

1369
00:38:33.601 --> 00:38:33.961
fuck,

1370
00:38:33.961 --> 00:38:34.740
you know what?

1371
00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.520
I'm like thinking more about writing is knocking at fix this neuroses like this

1372
00:38:39.521 --> 00:38:40.750
neurosis that I've developed,

1373
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.400
so I want to comedy.

1374
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:43.751
Wow,

1375
00:38:43.751 --> 00:38:44.584
that's awesome.

1376
00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.130
Yeah,

1377
00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:45.963
really helped.

1378
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.660
It's a very unique creative process as well because you're,

1379
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:49.991
you're,

1380
00:38:49.991 --> 00:38:54.670
you're giving birth to a bits that are much like life forms.

1381
00:38:54.671 --> 00:38:55.900
They have a very finite life.

1382
00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:57.640
He didn't take them and you could record them.

1383
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.600
They'll go on forever.

1384
00:38:58.720 --> 00:38:59.560
But the reality is,

1385
00:38:59.561 --> 00:39:01.180
as far as your relationship with them,

1386
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:02.110
it's very finite.

1387
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.850
You have a year or two with a bit.

1388
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:07.810
So like there's a bit right now that I'm doing on vegans that I don't want to

1389
00:39:07.811 --> 00:39:08.440
let go.

1390
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:08.951
I love it.

1391
00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:09.341
I love it.

1392
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:10.600
So it's like,

1393
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:13.110
it's like one of my favorite creations and,

1394
00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:13.400
and,

1395
00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:13.961
and it's,

1396
00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:14.680
um,

1397
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.513
I know it's,

1398
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.120
I'm going to put it down the summer on a DVD and then I've got to have to let it

1399
00:39:19.121 --> 00:39:20.410
go and it's over.

1400
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.760
You start new ones in some fashion appealing to you that it's a femoral,

1401
00:39:24.761 --> 00:39:25.750
that it comes and goes.

1402
00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:26.680
Is that part of the appeal?

1403
00:39:26.681 --> 00:39:28.350
Like why do as long as I have it on,

1404
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.790
on DVD or CD so people can enjoy it,

1405
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:31.960
it would suck if,

1406
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:32.060
uh,

1407
00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:32.410
there was,

1408
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:37.410
there's a few bits that I have never made it on anything that are just wacky ass

1409
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:43.741
bits that I came up with somewhere and I never figured out how to make them

1410
00:39:44.051 --> 00:39:45.940
acceptable and then I just abandoned them somewhere.

1411
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.990
Are there any,

1412
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:48.043
uh,

1413
00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.390
I'm just trying to figure out,

1414
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:52.300
something that fascinates me is looking for the anomalies,

1415
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:52.481
right?

1416
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:53.530
Whether it's in sports,

1417
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:53.960
uh,

1418
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.101
you know,

1419
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:54.940
people who are really good,

1420
00:39:54.941 --> 00:39:58.480
who shouldn't be or people who succeed despite not doing what they've been told

1421
00:39:58.481 --> 00:39:58.991
they have to do.

1422
00:39:58.991 --> 00:39:59.920
Like Enya for instance,

1423
00:39:59.921 --> 00:40:00.754
I don't listen to Enya.

1424
00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:01.331
However,

1425
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:03.010
what fascinates me about her is apparently,

1426
00:40:03.011 --> 00:40:03.850
and it could be getting this wrong,

1427
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:04.930
she doesn't tour,

1428
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:09.340
she's does zero her and she makes a gazillion fucking dollars cause she's like,

1429
00:40:09.341 --> 00:40:10.174
I don't want it to her.

1430
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:10.960
I'm not going to do it.

1431
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.730
I don't care if they tell me that everyone has to do,

1432
00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:13.564
I'm not going to.

1433
00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.850
And so I'm always wondering,

1434
00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:16.840
let's say looking at,

1435
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:17.111
you know,

1436
00:40:17.111 --> 00:40:18.160
standup comedy writing.

1437
00:40:18.161 --> 00:40:19.240
I can think of examples too.

1438
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:20.320
Like I've never done book tours.

1439
00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:21.550
I don't do book tours really.

1440
00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.390
Uh,

1441
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.980
just refused to do it in bookstores at least.

1442
00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:24.814
And for you.

1443
00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:27.520
And it's forced me to figure out more interesting,

1444
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.850
innovative ways like partnering with Bit Torrent for the four hour chef or

1445
00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:35.140
whatever other people in comedy who really break the mold.

1446
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:35.351
I mean,

1447
00:40:35.351 --> 00:40:36.010
I know,

1448
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.550
uh,

1449
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:37.810
like Louis did is,

1450
00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:38.683
uh,

1451
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:39.670
he had his,

1452
00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.050
I guess it was a new hour of content,

1453
00:40:41.051 --> 00:40:41.410
wasn't it?

1454
00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:42.790
That he sold directly on his site.

1455
00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.133
Uh,

1456
00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.130
but are there,

1457
00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:46.540
are there other people who really stand out,

1458
00:40:46.541 --> 00:40:47.650
is kind of breaking the mold,

1459
00:40:47.651 --> 00:40:48.010
but it's,

1460
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:52.150
Louis really is the most innovative guy today I think.

1461
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:52.721
And because he's,

1462
00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:53.531
he seems to be,

1463
00:40:53.531 --> 00:40:54.050
to be the,

1464
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:58.270
to meed rather to be the most obsessed with creating stuff,

1465
00:40:58.271 --> 00:40:59.290
whether it's his TV show,

1466
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:00.250
which he edits himself,

1467
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:01.473
writes himself,

1468
00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:02.360
you know,

1469
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.400
I had a conversation with them at the Improv after his first show didn't work

1470
00:41:06.401 --> 00:41:07.000
out.

1471
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:07.451
And I said,

1472
00:41:07.451 --> 00:41:08.710
if you had to do anything differently,

1473
00:41:08.711 --> 00:41:09.880
like what would you do differently?

1474
00:41:09.881 --> 00:41:10.210
And said,

1475
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.230
I would fire the writers.

1476
00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.060
He goes to the good guys and everything,

1477
00:41:13.061 --> 00:41:13.550
but it just,

1478
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.340
it wasn't what I wanted it,

1479
00:41:15.341 --> 00:41:15.610
you know,

1480
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:18.760
just so this time what he decided to do was like,

1481
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:19.631
you really,

1482
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:23.170
the only way to get what you're trying to get out is for you to do it.

1483
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:23.510
Yeah.

1484
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:24.430
You have to do it yourself.

1485
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:24.671
You know,

1486
00:41:24.671 --> 00:41:25.600
you have to edit it yourself.

1487
00:41:25.601 --> 00:41:26.434
You have to write it yourself.

1488
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.800
It's just most people don't have the energy or the,

1489
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:32.530
the obsession to do that and do stand up.

1490
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:32.771
You know,

1491
00:41:32.771 --> 00:41:34.220
it's really kind of amazing and

1492
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:35.390
<v 0>not just to stand up,</v>

1493
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:35.870
like,

1494
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.720
and rely on an act that you sort of rehashing every,

1495
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:39.200
you know,

1496
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:40.520
every time you go on stage,

1497
00:41:40.521 --> 00:41:42.230
you've done the same act for the last six years.

1498
00:41:42.231 --> 00:41:43.064
You could always do it.

1499
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.281
No,

1500
00:41:43.281 --> 00:41:45.200
he's doing a whole new hour every year.

1501
00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:47.600
So that's really inspiring.

1502
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.650
It's really inspiring.

1503
00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:49.490
How do you,

1504
00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.620
this is just tangentially related,

1505
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:52.700
but how do you,

1506
00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.333
uh,

1507
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.240
how have you made your career decisions?

1508
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.811
Like you mentioned,

1509
00:41:56.811 --> 00:41:56.920
you,

1510
00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:59.120
you asked him if he were to do it over again,

1511
00:41:59.121 --> 00:41:59.940
what would he do differently?

1512
00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.610
Fire the writers.

1513
00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:01.520
Like how,

1514
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:05.300
how did you evaluate opportunities and projects and whatnot these days?

1515
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.110
I'm very instinctual and that sounds like really cliche,

1516
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:13.580
but I really believe that the right answer is always right there.

1517
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.880
I,

1518
00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.410
there's a few things that I've pondered in the,

1519
00:42:17.411 --> 00:42:19.880
in my past and I've gone back and forth like,

1520
00:42:19.881 --> 00:42:20.270
ma'am,

1521
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.840
hmm,

1522
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:21.380
should I do this?

1523
00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.213
Should I not do this?

1524
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:25.250
But ultimately the right answer's always right there in front of my face,

1525
00:42:25.251 --> 00:42:26.630
even if it's not what I want to hear.

1526
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.410
Even if the other answer pays you more money or the right answer is always,

1527
00:42:30.411 --> 00:42:30.671
and I've,

1528
00:42:30.671 --> 00:42:32.570
I've taken the wrong answer a few times.

1529
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:34.080
Like my did fear phone though,

1530
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:35.181
but,

1531
00:42:35.181 --> 00:42:35.390
uh,

1532
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.040
it was the right answer financially.

1533
00:42:37.041 --> 00:42:39.080
So I sort of accepted it.

1534
00:42:39.081 --> 00:42:39.621
But when I'm,

1535
00:42:39.621 --> 00:42:42.350
when I look at it like as far as like the,

1536
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:43.520
what I'm going to enjoy,

1537
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.650
what I'm going to enjoy when I'm going to really excel at,

1538
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:46.970
it has to be something that,

1539
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:47.161
uh,

1540
00:42:47.161 --> 00:42:47.540
I'm,

1541
00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:48.410
I'm fascinated with.

1542
00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:49.850
It has to be something that I locked into,

1543
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.860
whether it's the ultimate fighting championship,

1544
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:52.970
whether it's standup comedy,

1545
00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:53.601
whether it's anything.

1546
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:55.440
I do podcasts and whenever anything I do,

1547
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:56.780
I have to be fascinated by it.

1548
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.080
Yeah.

1549
00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.340
Otherwise I'm not going to be successful.

1550
00:42:58.341 --> 00:43:00.980
So I just go towards that and that's what I've always done.

1551
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:05.180
It's just somehow or another worked out that cage fighting commentary and

1552
00:43:05.181 --> 00:43:07.670
standup comedy sort of can be packaged together.

1553
00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.230
It doesn't seem like it should be,

1554
00:43:09.231 --> 00:43:14.231
but it can be if that's actually what you are really in interested in what I

1555
00:43:14.501 --> 00:43:15.321
mean and you know,

1556
00:43:15.321 --> 00:43:17.960
whatever else you're interested in that can be packaged in there as well.

1557
00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:18.741
You know,

1558
00:43:18.741 --> 00:43:19.700
whether it's fitness,

1559
00:43:19.701 --> 00:43:20.534
martial arts,

1560
00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:21.471
playing pool,

1561
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:22.430
you know like do,

1562
00:43:22.431 --> 00:43:24.140
what the fuck is on your head.

1563
00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:25.073
That's my,

1564
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:26.900
I heard a rumor that you are very,

1565
00:43:26.901 --> 00:43:28.070
very good at pool.

1566
00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:28.400
Yeah.

1567
00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:28.880
Very good.

1568
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:29.061
Yeah.

1569
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:29.870
I had no idea.

1570
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:31.040
That's pretty good.

1571
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.371
Yeah,

1572
00:43:31.371 --> 00:43:31.940
I think I could.

1573
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.620
I could play professional if I had time.

1574
00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.030
Why haven't you get took good?

1575
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:36.890
Well I've been obsessed with it ever since I was young.

1576
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:39.590
I tore my ACL in 1990,

1577
00:43:39.591 --> 00:43:43.310
I think somewhere around there and I had to have surgery and while I was

1578
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.473
rehabbing,

1579
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:49.280
I started playing pool and I had a buddy of mine who was really good and I met

1580
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:52.430
him during that time and I was just fascinated by what he could do with the

1581
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:53.540
balls that I couldn't do.

1582
00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:54.381
So,

1583
00:43:54.381 --> 00:43:54.740
uh,

1584
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:55.880
I started,

1585
00:43:55.881 --> 00:43:56.500
uh,

1586
00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.120
just started playing like every day I'm obsessed with it now.

1587
00:43:59.121 --> 00:44:00.410
I have a table at home and I practice,

1588
00:44:00.411 --> 00:44:01.790
I play in a tournament every now and then.

1589
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.000
I came in second place in a,

1590
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.020
in a local tournament really recently.

1591
00:44:06.021 --> 00:44:06.854
I should have one too.

1592
00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:07.693
I'm just fucking,

1593
00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.300
I get a little aggressive sometimes because uh,

1594
00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.430
I may come to their pool,

1595
00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.880
like pool player maybe don't go together quite as well.

1596
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:19.460
There's certain times where you shouldn't shoot a shot.

1597
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:21.170
Like they'll the like the right,

1598
00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:26.200
the correct way to play is you play a geometry and percentages so you play like

1599
00:44:26.751 --> 00:44:27.710
geometric angle,

1600
00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.010
you know,

1601
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:29.360
you leading off the ball.

1602
00:44:29.361 --> 00:44:29.600
Like,

1603
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:32.160
I want to go in a very specific angle towards the next

1604
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:34.650
<v 1>ball so that as I collide with the ball,</v>

1605
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:38.250
that natural progression of the object ball in the cue ball,

1606
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:39.443
I could chart it.

1607
00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.811
You know,

1608
00:44:39.811 --> 00:44:40.411
so I'm looking,

1609
00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:41.730
if I hit the ball to the left,

1610
00:44:41.731 --> 00:44:43.150
it's going to bounce off to the right like,

1611
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.170
and so all that is going on in your head and you're,

1612
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:46.411
you're,

1613
00:44:46.411 --> 00:44:47.760
you're calculating it all.

1614
00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.070
That's like the,

1615
00:44:50.340 --> 00:44:52.440
you're not supposed to shoot shots.

1616
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:54.510
We have a 10% chance of making them,

1617
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:55.770
he's supposed to play safe.

1618
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.150
But I try to be a hero.

1619
00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:57.751
I'm like,

1620
00:44:57.751 --> 00:44:58.710
but if it's fun,

1621
00:44:58.770 --> 00:44:59.071
if I,

1622
00:44:59.071 --> 00:45:00.000
if I cut it in,

1623
00:45:00.001 --> 00:45:00.800
I win,

1624
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.251
you know,

1625
00:45:01.251 --> 00:45:05.880
so I'll take wacky shots and I wound up like losing a tournament because of

1626
00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:06.210
that.

1627
00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.290
But it's fun.

1628
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:08.171
I have a,

1629
00:45:08.171 --> 00:45:12.870
I have to sort of manage the idea of winning and the idea with going out cowboy

1630
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:15.540
style because I go out cowboy style a lot when I play pool.

1631
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.510
Cause if somebody leaves me a crazy shot,

1632
00:45:18.511 --> 00:45:19.380
I'll try to cut it in.

1633
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:20.520
You know,

1634
00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.450
cause I make them like half the time and that's almost worth it to me.

1635
00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:26.850
But in the sense of a race to seven tournament,

1636
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:27.750
it's not worth it at all.

1637
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:28.140
Right.

1638
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:28.540
You know?

1639
00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:30.840
So if I played professionally,

1640
00:45:30.841 --> 00:45:32.400
if I decided to go do that,

1641
00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:34.710
I would have to practice for about six months I think.

1642
00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.850
And then I would have to play on a lot of tournaments and then just go and do

1643
00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:39.960
that all day like they do.

1644
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:40.860
But I think I could do it.

1645
00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.180
Such a fun,

1646
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.013
such a fun game.

1647
00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:43.980
Yeah,

1648
00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:44.813
it's an awesome game.

1649
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.511
I got really into,

1650
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:50.511
I became fascinated with darts recently to him because I saw it on TV in the UK.

1651
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:52.380
I was there recently for the uh,

1652
00:45:52.381 --> 00:45:57.381
the UK book launch to the four hour chef and they had darts on TV and this guy

1653
00:45:58.201 --> 00:46:03.201
stands right next to the board and just announces the scores like one 2150 and

1654
00:46:03.781 --> 00:46:05.220
just announces each,

1655
00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.340
each round of scores as they go.

1656
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:10.530
But these guys were incredible.

1657
00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.260
I just could not believe how accurate they were in this,

1658
00:46:13.261 --> 00:46:15.330
in this tiny like double or triple boxes.

1659
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:17.400
And they put three right on top of each other.

1660
00:46:17.450 --> 00:46:17.610
Yeah.

1661
00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.410
It must be very satisfying to be that good.

1662
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:21.150
Yeah.

1663
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:22.470
When you hit a bullseye look,

1664
00:46:22.471 --> 00:46:23.880
that is fucking satisfying.

1665
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.930
The hand eye coordination games are very satisfying,

1666
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:30.180
but to me that's pool.

1667
00:46:30.210 --> 00:46:32.620
But pool also has a million other things into it.

1668
00:46:32.621 --> 00:46:33.690
As calculations.

1669
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:34.320
Every,

1670
00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.550
every table looks different.

1671
00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.260
When you're looking at the DART board,

1672
00:46:37.261 --> 00:46:38.550
you're always seeing the same God damn dark.

1673
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.001
Right?

1674
00:46:39.001 --> 00:46:39.450
That's true.

1675
00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:40.283
That's true.

1676
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.400
You know where to throw it.

1677
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.540
But when you're playing pool,

1678
00:46:42.541 --> 00:46:45.060
you're looking at a million different shots.

1679
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:45.953
Change on scale.

1680
00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:46.230
Yeah.

1681
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.370
And you have choices to make.

1682
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:48.090
You could go left,

1683
00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:48.751
you can go right.

1684
00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:49.980
How do you want to get to that other ball?

1685
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:51.450
Do you want to try and take a long shot?

1686
00:46:51.451 --> 00:46:52.284
What do you want to do?

1687
00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:55.020
And so there's all these decisions we have to meet and you have to execute.

1688
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.730
So I have to know what's going on.

1689
00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:00.030
And then you also have to have this hand eye coordination and understanding

1690
00:47:00.031 --> 00:47:00.864
where the balls go.

1691
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.970
It's just we're losing it because of video games,

1692
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.910
which are understandably really stimulating.

1693
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:07.320
And really fucking fun.

1694
00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.740
It takes a long time to get to the point where pool pools really fun and get

1695
00:47:10.741 --> 00:47:11.574
really good at it.

1696
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:13.170
As a side note on video games,

1697
00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.580
so I'm uh,

1698
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.310
I'm in the process of funding some,

1699
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.050
not,

1700
00:47:18.050 --> 00:47:19.530
not wholly on my own,

1701
00:47:19.531 --> 00:47:21.900
but funding some studies at UC.

1702
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:27.380
So University of California San Francisco looking at a cognitive performance

1703
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:28.150
training,

1704
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.470
uh,

1705
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.520
specifically using video games,

1706
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.180
<v 3>iPads and also the connect for physical movement.</v>

1707
00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:35.793
And uh,

1708
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.500
we're going to be playing around with uh,

1709
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:40.630
transcranial direct stimulation,

1710
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.440
which is effectively where you take the equivalent of a nine volt battery and

1711
00:47:44.441 --> 00:47:49.441
apply a current across the cranium and they've done testing with a military

1712
00:47:50.921 --> 00:47:51.490
shooters,

1713
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.323
snipers,

1714
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.420
they'll put them into a first person shooter game and they can get them from

1715
00:47:55.421 --> 00:47:58.510
like 20 to 100% and in a,

1716
00:47:58.511 --> 00:48:00.070
in an in an afternoon.

1717
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:02.260
It's incredible.

1718
00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:04.060
And so the next step would be,

1719
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:05.140
which is what I want to do,

1720
00:48:05.141 --> 00:48:08.800
but there's a lot more involved once you add the pharmacological aspect.

1721
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:13.830
I want to do a combination of cognitive training without the transcranial

1722
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.353
stimulation.

1723
00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:21.360
Then with transcranial stimulation and then with things like modafinil and to

1724
00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:24.760
see what kind of will come kind of superhuman performance.

1725
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:25.594
You can,

1726
00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:26.670
you can manufacturer

1727
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.340
<v 0>where of this Dave Aspery program that he,</v>

1728
00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:31.140
he's a part of their,

1729
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:33.340
I believe it's in Vancouver.

1730
00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:34.240
He goes and they,

1731
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:39.100
they hook you up to some fucking machine for five days and approved as Iq by 20

1732
00:48:39.101 --> 00:48:39.934
points.

1733
00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:40.660
<v 3>I don't,</v>

1734
00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:40.820
uh,

1735
00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:40.950
uh,

1736
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:41.200
you know,

1737
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:41.450
I,

1738
00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:41.780
I've,

1739
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:41.931
uh,

1740
00:48:41.931 --> 00:48:42.691
he's a smart guy.

1741
00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:42.800
I've,

1742
00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:43.850
I've heard some of those interviews.

1743
00:48:43.851 --> 00:48:46.700
I don't know anything about the location in Vancouver.

1744
00:48:46.701 --> 00:48:47.534
You can,

1745
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:48.920
you can also,

1746
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.843
uh,

1747
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:52.460
I'd be interested to know how we went about doing it.

1748
00:48:52.461 --> 00:48:52.881
Of course,

1749
00:48:52.881 --> 00:48:53.170
the,

1750
00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:54.920
you can game Iq pretty easily.

1751
00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:56.751
For instance,

1752
00:48:56.751 --> 00:48:58.370
if you learn something called the,

1753
00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:00.410
at the consonant system,

1754
00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.110
uh,

1755
00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:04.340
it goes by a couple of different names where you,

1756
00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:09.830
you learn how to associate numbers with consonants and then you turn those

1757
00:49:09.831 --> 00:49:13.700
continents into images and you can get to the point where you're memorizing a

1758
00:49:13.701 --> 00:49:17.330
hundred numbers and can do it forwards and backwards in maybe a week of

1759
00:49:17.331 --> 00:49:18.164
practice.

1760
00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:23.170
And then you're able to completely destroy the serial memorization tasks that

1761
00:49:23.841 --> 00:49:24.740
they have on Iq,

1762
00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:25.880
on Iq tests.

1763
00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.510
And I know that because I,

1764
00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:32.990
I took a multiple high Iq test and did training in between them.

1765
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:37.990
This was probably 2005 direct specifically to see if I could improve what is

1766
00:49:38.271 --> 00:49:39.230
supposed to be fixed.

1767
00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:39.950
And you,

1768
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:41.390
I mean aspirin knows this of course,

1769
00:49:41.391 --> 00:49:42.560
but you can definitely,

1770
00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:42.950
you can,

1771
00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:44.960
you can absolutely improve your Iq.

1772
00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.450
So please explain how the hell that works.

1773
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:47.790
Okay.

1774
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:47.990
You,

1775
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:49.880
you connect numbers,

1776
00:49:49.881 --> 00:49:50.840
two consonants.

1777
00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:51.920
So I'll give you an example.

1778
00:49:51.921 --> 00:49:56.390
It's so it's super easy and in fact not to like plug the shit out of it.

1779
00:49:56.391 --> 00:49:56.931
But the,

1780
00:49:56.931 --> 00:49:57.680
uh,

1781
00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.290
in this,

1782
00:49:58.290 --> 00:49:59.720
in the four hour chef I talk about,

1783
00:50:00.090 --> 00:50:00.923
uh,

1784
00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:02.533
encoding,

1785
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:03.441
basically taking something,

1786
00:50:03.441 --> 00:50:07.550
it's really hard to memorize like numbers and tagging it to something that's

1787
00:50:07.551 --> 00:50:09.890
easy to memorize or have to remember like images.

1788
00:50:09.891 --> 00:50:10.581
So if you took,

1789
00:50:10.581 --> 00:50:11.061
for instance,

1790
00:50:11.061 --> 00:50:11.894
the number one,

1791
00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:17.150
number one has one downstroke so it's a t or a d.

1792
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.631
Okay.

1793
00:50:17.631 --> 00:50:19.490
So you can use either letter then,

1794
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:20.780
uh,

1795
00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.960
that number two is an end cause then has to down strokes.

1796
00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:27.770
Number three is an m because it has three down strokes and on and so forth.

1797
00:50:27.771 --> 00:50:28.550
Right?

1798
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:33.550
So if you had let's say a one and two and you're trying to remember the number

1799
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:35.030
12,

1800
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:39.170
well one can be t and two is n.

1801
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.970
So tin you could just remember like tin can and then all of a sudden you have

1802
00:50:44.090 --> 00:50:48.320
one and to remember 10 and then you might have like 10.

1803
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:51.080
And then something else like let's just say three,

1804
00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:52.280
one which would be like myth.

1805
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.190
So it could be like a tin baseball,

1806
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.840
like a baseball Mitt made out of tin.

1807
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.590
Okay fine.

1808
00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.140
They have 10 minutes and then you just go on and on.

1809
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:00.901
You memorize these things.

1810
00:51:00.901 --> 00:51:02.960
So let's say we were doing it in this room right now.

1811
00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:03.980
You could have,

1812
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:04.340
if you,

1813
00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:07.460
I used to memorize serial numbers on,

1814
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:08.270
uh,

1815
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.780
on,

1816
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:09.080
uh,

1817
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.600
bills that I would have in my wallet just for exercise.

1818
00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:15.320
Like I wake up in the morning at a time myself to memorize serial numbers and do

1819
00:51:15.321 --> 00:51:16.154
the back and forth.

1820
00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.940
And so I did this in college that I've taken a lot before or after beating off

1821
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:23.300
cause that's what everybody did definitely before.

1822
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:23.990
Okay.

1823
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:27.570
I'm more of an evening lanker just my personal preference,

1824
00:51:27.571 --> 00:51:31.190
but this is more of a wind down with my glass of wine.

1825
00:51:31.191 --> 00:51:32.024
But the uh,

1826
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:33.100
the,

1827
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.120
the way you do it is if you had like 10 minutes,

1828
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.391
right?

1829
00:51:35.391 --> 00:51:35.740
And you'd,

1830
00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:40.280
you'd visualize that in one location in the room and then you could come right

1831
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:41.810
next to like you'd go to the microphone,

1832
00:51:41.811 --> 00:51:43.670
then you place the next two images there.

1833
00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:47.330
So you have basically four numbers at each location and you can get to the point

1834
00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.201
literally in a week.

1835
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:51.620
It's very easy where you're memorizing 20 to a hundred numbers at a time and you

1836
00:51:51.621 --> 00:51:53.030
can do it bat forwards and backwards.

1837
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:54.380
What I used to do to freak people out,

1838
00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:56.660
and this is totally trainable,

1839
00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.231
totally,

1840
00:51:57.231 --> 00:51:58.310
totally coachable,

1841
00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:02.600
is I would have somebody pull out a bill out of their wallet and be like a $1

1842
00:52:02.601 --> 00:52:02.781
bill,

1843
00:52:02.781 --> 00:52:03.920
$5 bill 20 whatever.

1844
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:05.150
And I would memorize it and I'd be like,

1845
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:05.331
all right,

1846
00:52:05.331 --> 00:52:08.060
don't spend this and just hold onto it until I see you next time.

1847
00:52:08.061 --> 00:52:10.310
And I'd like to circle something like put a circle on it or whatever.

1848
00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:12.920
And then I'd see them the next time and I'd be able to remember,

1849
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:13.131
okay,

1850
00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:15.360
well when I was with Joe and he pulled that five out of his wallet,

1851
00:52:15.361 --> 00:52:16.850
like we memorized it in this room.

1852
00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:20.180
So I would recall the room and I'd see you like three weeks later and I'd be

1853
00:52:20.181 --> 00:52:23.030
able to tell you exactly what the numbers were on that bill

1854
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.690
because the visual memory is so strong.

1855
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.230
That's what,

1856
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:28.063
that's what,

1857
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:28.490
uh,

1858
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.650
Cicero it used to do for Senate debates.

1859
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:34.080
When you had to memorize content and talking points for like three hours at a

1860
00:52:34.081 --> 00:52:34.914
time,

1861
00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:35.600
he would,

1862
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.710
he would place his topics as images in different locations in the hall where he

1863
00:52:39.711 --> 00:52:40.544
was actually speaking.

1864
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:44.540
Is that why your memory improves when you physically write things down?

1865
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:46.400
That's a good question.

1866
00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:47.570
I do think that,

1867
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:49.070
at least in my experience,

1868
00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.960
I don't know what research centers to support this,

1869
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:52.850
but the more senses you involved,

1870
00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:53.390
uh,

1871
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.920
involve certainly kinesthetically for me it helps tremendously if I write things

1872
00:52:57.921 --> 00:52:58.990
down physically.

1873
00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:00.680
That's why I do all of my editing by hand.

1874
00:53:00.740 --> 00:53:01.251
My writing,

1875
00:53:01.251 --> 00:53:01.720
editing,

1876
00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:01.890
I'll,

1877
00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:02.271
I'll do,

1878
00:53:02.271 --> 00:53:03.800
I'll first draft on the computer,

1879
00:53:03.801 --> 00:53:06.920
but I always printed out and then edit by hand as I do revisions.

1880
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.390
So you edit by hand,

1881
00:53:08.391 --> 00:53:09.201
meaning you,

1882
00:53:09.201 --> 00:53:10.880
you write notes printed out,

1883
00:53:10.881 --> 00:53:12.680
print the notes out and I can just,

1884
00:53:12.681 --> 00:53:15.140
I can like the nonlinear connections or I'm like,

1885
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:16.820
oh this paragraphs you have three pages later,

1886
00:53:16.821 --> 00:53:18.770
these three paragraphs she get cut that,

1887
00:53:18.771 --> 00:53:19.100
that,

1888
00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:20.570
that the right on the paper.

1889
00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:21.290
Do you both sticky?

1890
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:25.070
I write right on the paper and I just put the connections together.

1891
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:31.310
My ability to edit on a computer where I have to scroll is much less intuitive,

1892
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:33.900
which means the writing ends up less natural.

1893
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:34.980
If I had it on a computer,

1894
00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:36.121
that makes sense.

1895
00:53:36.121 --> 00:53:39.450
Cause sometimes I have to go over a paragraph or something that I've written and

1896
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:39.781
I'm like,

1897
00:53:39.781 --> 00:53:40.081
wow.

1898
00:53:40.081 --> 00:53:42.390
It just doesn't seem to flow with the paragraph before.

1899
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:44.430
But it seemed to as I was writing it,

1900
00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:45.121
and it's also,

1901
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.080
there's less for me,

1902
00:53:46.081 --> 00:53:47.130
at least when I'm writing,

1903
00:53:47.131 --> 00:53:51.810
there's less psycholo psychological resistance to kind of killing my babies.

1904
00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:52.740
The things that I love,

1905
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.360
if I can just cross out with a pen,

1906
00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.860
if I have to delete it on a computer,

1907
00:53:55.861 --> 00:53:56.100
I'm like,

1908
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:56.490
ah,

1909
00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:57.400
but then what if I need it?

1910
00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.750
Uh,

1911
00:53:58.840 --> 00:53:59.190
that,

1912
00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:03.240
that one gem that I think is that twist of phrase that I think is so genius,

1913
00:54:03.241 --> 00:54:04.410
but it's fucking out of place.

1914
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:05.280
It doesn't make any sense.

1915
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.291
All of that stuff.

1916
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:09.840
Stacks of those that I go to and desperation when I,

1917
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:14.760
whenever I release a new bid or a new DVD or something like that,

1918
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:15.990
I didn't have to go over the notes.

1919
00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:19.420
So I'll go into some shit that I just left hanging around.

1920
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:20.333
You could do with those,

1921
00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:20.810
I'll tell you.

1922
00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:22.080
So there's a guy named Tucker Max,

1923
00:54:22.081 --> 00:54:23.400
he might or might not know the name,

1924
00:54:23.401 --> 00:54:23.940
but he,

1925
00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:24.550
uh,

1926
00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:28.980
an author has had a number of New York Times best is a very controversial guy,

1927
00:54:28.981 --> 00:54:29.521
but one of the,

1928
00:54:29.521 --> 00:54:34.521
he's a brilliant marketer and one of the things he did is he took his stories

1929
00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:37.050
that were kind of second rate that he had sitting around.

1930
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.561
And he was like,

1931
00:54:37.561 --> 00:54:37.950
Eh,

1932
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:39.210
like never put them in a book cause he's like,

1933
00:54:39.211 --> 00:54:41.010
I'm not going to charge my readers,

1934
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:41.461
you know,

1935
00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:43.080
20 bucks for this then it's not worth it.

1936
00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:47.730
And so he put them all into a book called sloppy seconds that he gave away for

1937
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:48.564
free.

1938
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:53.660
But in that book he had samples like his best stories from his other books and

1939
00:54:54.871 --> 00:54:57.270
it put all of those books back on the New York Times bestseller list.

1940
00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:58.273
Hmm.

1941
00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.273
Really,

1942
00:54:59.370 --> 00:54:59.731
really,

1943
00:54:59.731 --> 00:55:00.564
really clever.

1944
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:01.590
That is pretty smart.

1945
00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:02.663
Very smart.

1946
00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:03.560
Yeah.

1947
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.970
I feel like it's a good idea to give people shit for free too.

1948
00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:07.140
It's always a good idea.

1949
00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:07.711
Well check.

1950
00:55:07.711 --> 00:55:07.951
Okay,

1951
00:55:07.951 --> 00:55:08.920
I'll give you a crazy number.

1952
00:55:08.921 --> 00:55:09.754
So when,

1953
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:12.270
when I did the partnership with bittorrent,

1954
00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:17.330
so bit torrents usually associated with pirated content and I,

1955
00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:20.070
I approached them,

1956
00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.420
I was introduced to them,

1957
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.313
uh,

1958
00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:26.270
and immediately that same day went down to their office in San Francisco,

1959
00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:31.320
got together and pitched a promoted landing page for the four hour chef was

1960
00:55:32.171 --> 00:55:32.261
like,

1961
00:55:32.261 --> 00:55:35.520
I'll give you two and a half gigabytes of free material book stuff,

1962
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:36.630
chapters that were cut,

1963
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:37.651
uh,

1964
00:55:37.651 --> 00:55:37.861
you know,

1965
00:55:37.861 --> 00:55:39.300
like 24 hours with GSP,

1966
00:55:39.301 --> 00:55:39.830
like his hold,

1967
00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:40.740
like specked out,

1968
00:55:40.741 --> 00:55:41.880
calorie by Calorie Diet.

1969
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.710
Like all this stuff I'll give to you for free,

1970
00:55:43.711 --> 00:55:44.820
including all this extra stuff.

1971
00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:46.080
And then just,

1972
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.190
just put up a link that says,

1973
00:55:47.191 --> 00:55:47.371
you know,

1974
00:55:47.371 --> 00:55:48.030
support,

1975
00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:48.511
support,

1976
00:55:48.511 --> 00:55:50.280
this artist that clicks through to my Amazon page,

1977
00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:51.173
we'll see what happens.

1978
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:51.750
Great.

1979
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:53.070
So they helped put it together,

1980
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:56.460
took next to no time to set it up.

1981
00:55:56.790 --> 00:56:01.790
Had a more than 60% click through rate from the download page to Amazon.

1982
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:03.810
That's insane.

1983
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:04.350
Like,

1984
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:04.710
wow.

1985
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:06.840
Six out of 10 people click through to the Amazon page.

1986
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:09.480
It just astonishingly effective.

1987
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:11.340
Astonish and effective.

1988
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.233
Yeah.

1989
00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.750
Some weird situation now where you're like out of bookstores now,

1990
00:56:15.751 --> 00:56:16.584
right?

1991
00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:17.540
Oh,

1992
00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.031
it's still going on.

1993
00:56:18.031 --> 00:56:18.191
Yeah.

1994
00:56:18.191 --> 00:56:19.590
Boycotted by Barnes and noble and all that.

1995
00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:20.281
And what happened?

1996
00:56:20.281 --> 00:56:20.761
How did that,

1997
00:56:20.761 --> 00:56:22.030
I forget how that got started,

1998
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:22.830
right?

1999
00:56:22.830 --> 00:56:23.411
What that was it?

2000
00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:24.244
Panera bread.

2001
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:24.851
Oh yeah.

2002
00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:25.990
I didn't experiment with Panero.

2003
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:26.980
Uh,

2004
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.140
and a pilot just to,

2005
00:56:29.141 --> 00:56:29.530
uh,

2006
00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:33.010
mostly that was to scare the shit out of the publishing industry because Barnes

2007
00:56:33.011 --> 00:56:33.700
and noble,

2008
00:56:33.700 --> 00:56:35.410
I think they're closing like 500 stores or something.

2009
00:56:35.410 --> 00:56:36.040
So,

2010
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:36.341
I mean,

2011
00:56:36.341 --> 00:56:36.521
there,

2012
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:39.370
there are their pallet and brass on the titanic at this point,

2013
00:56:39.371 --> 00:56:40.050
but,

2014
00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:42.490
but they were able to hurt me in the beginning for the lists.

2015
00:56:42.550 --> 00:56:46.570
But what I did is I partnered with Panera very briefly for a trial because they

2016
00:56:46.571 --> 00:56:48.430
have 1500 locations around the country.

2017
00:56:48.431 --> 00:56:50.380
So I went to everybody and in publishing to Poop,

2018
00:56:50.381 --> 00:56:51.640
they're pampers and panic.

2019
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:53.530
And uh,

2020
00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:58.420
since the book hit the hit the New York Times number four New York Times and hit

2021
00:56:58.421 --> 00:56:59.254
all the other lists,

2022
00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:00.730
uh,

2023
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:01.420
have been,

2024
00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.020
have been going through all of these unlikely suspects,

2025
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.670
like Kroger's rosaries,

2026
00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:10.420
a Williams-Sonoma urban outfitters carries it now.

2027
00:57:10.421 --> 00:57:11.111
So I'm just like,

2028
00:57:11.111 --> 00:57:11.531
look guys,

2029
00:57:11.531 --> 00:57:12.610
you're going to force,

2030
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:17.800
you're going to force other retailers to take your place by pulling this kind of

2031
00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:18.400
high jinks.

2032
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:19.500
So what is the hygiene?

2033
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:21.670
So that's what I'm [inaudible] the high jinx is the,

2034
00:57:21.671 --> 00:57:26.620
so the four hour chef was the first major book acquired by Amazon publishing.

2035
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:28.211
Not Amazon.

2036
00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:29.290
I am self publishing,

2037
00:57:29.291 --> 00:57:33.670
but an actual office in New York City competing against the major publishers,

2038
00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:35.440
signing authors to giving advances.

2039
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:39.370
It was run by Amazon and Barnes and nobles of course,

2040
00:57:39.371 --> 00:57:40.660
extremely threatened by Amazon.

2041
00:57:40.661 --> 00:57:41.051
So they're like,

2042
00:57:41.051 --> 00:57:43.020
we're not going to care anything that Amazon publishes.

2043
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:44.360
And,

2044
00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:44.600
uh,

2045
00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.360
that is why I'm not carried in any,

2046
00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:46.691
any,

2047
00:57:46.691 --> 00:57:47.140
uh,

2048
00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:49.210
that seems rather douchey.

2049
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:50.891
It's not,

2050
00:57:50.891 --> 00:57:51.161
you know,

2051
00:57:51.161 --> 00:57:51.411
it's,

2052
00:57:51.411 --> 00:57:53.530
it's not terribly effective either.

2053
00:57:53.531 --> 00:57:54.011
What they did,

2054
00:57:54.011 --> 00:57:55.900
which was smart is,

2055
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.590
uh,

2056
00:57:56.590 --> 00:57:57.680
from a competitive standpoint.

2057
00:57:57.700 --> 00:57:57.821
I mean,

2058
00:57:57.821 --> 00:57:58.601
it's not going to save them,

2059
00:57:58.601 --> 00:57:59.000
but,

2060
00:57:59.000 --> 00:57:59.470
uh,

2061
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.831
I have,

2062
00:57:59.831 --> 00:58:03.400
I have a bunch of theories about what they're going to do a in a lot of

2063
00:58:03.401 --> 00:58:04.234
respects,

2064
00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.620
but they,

2065
00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:08.320
because they blocked the book from the Nook,

2066
00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:09.183
right?

2067
00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.010
Which is their kindle equipment of those fucking things.

2068
00:58:12.011 --> 00:58:12.151
Yeah.

2069
00:58:12.151 --> 00:58:12.430
Yeah.

2070
00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:13.263
So they blocked,

2071
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.481
yeah.

2072
00:58:13.481 --> 00:58:14.920
So they blocked the four hour chef from the neck.

2073
00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:15.753
They won't carry it.

2074
00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:17.140
But here's what that does.

2075
00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:21.520
It's scares other authors because why should you use the knuck when you could

2076
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:22.271
use the kindle?

2077
00:58:22.271 --> 00:58:24.610
Here's what happens is if you're an author and you're like,

2078
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.200
which publish three or should I go with,

2079
00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:31.300
if you see that Tim Ferriss sold 37,000 digital copies first week,

2080
00:58:31.301 --> 00:58:32.650
fourth of the four hour chef,

2081
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:37.300
none of them counted for the New York Times because they were reported from one

2082
00:58:37.301 --> 00:58:37.780
source,

2083
00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:38.050
I.

2084
00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:38.051
E.

2085
00:58:38.051 --> 00:58:38.884
The kindle.

2086
00:58:39.070 --> 00:58:41.440
If I had sold 20 copies through the Nook,

2087
00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.650
it would have been number one said they they,

2088
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:45.670
they're playing a game of,

2089
00:58:45.671 --> 00:58:46.900
of intimidation tactic,

2090
00:58:46.901 --> 00:58:47.710
but it's not going to work.

2091
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:48.700
And even if a,

2092
00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:49.511
anyway,

2093
00:58:49.511 --> 00:58:52.960
I'm enjoying it because it's just like this David and Goliath battle where I get

2094
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:54.130
to do all this guerrilla warfare,

2095
00:58:54.131 --> 00:58:54.964
which I enjoy.

2096
00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:56.020
Wow.

2097
00:58:56.020 --> 00:58:56.920
It sounds crazy.

2098
00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:57.731
Yeah,

2099
00:58:57.731 --> 00:58:58.061
it's fun.

2100
00:58:58.061 --> 00:58:58.301
What a,

2101
00:58:58.301 --> 00:58:59.710
what a bunch of Douche is.

2102
00:58:59.711 --> 00:59:01.090
Barnes and noble turned out to be.

2103
00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.590
That's such a Douche move.

2104
00:59:02.591 --> 00:59:03.670
So the book man,

2105
00:59:04.460 --> 00:59:05.680
you sell books.

2106
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:09.340
What do you care who the publisher is like what kind of pussy fucking way of

2107
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:11.640
doing businesses that that's,

2108
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:14.230
you know what that's like someone trying to,

2109
00:59:14.231 --> 00:59:15.490
that's like crabs in a bucket.

2110
00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:20.710
You know the expression for one crab has climbing on top of the bucket.

2111
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:22.010
They never there because the other crabs

2112
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:23.000
<v 0>grab him and pull him down.</v>

2113
00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:23.961
Like what?

2114
00:59:23.961 --> 00:59:26.870
Do you know why you upset that Amazon is doing well?

2115
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:30.980
Why don't you realize that people don't like your fucking store so much or fix

2116
00:59:30.981 --> 00:59:32.480
that you do do something different.

2117
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:36.020
Draw people in somehow other than having magazine racks,

2118
00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:36.410
you know,

2119
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:37.090
what are you going to do,

2120
00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:37.250
do,

2121
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:38.083
do something different?

2122
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:39.710
So they did decide to do something different.

2123
00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:42.500
They came out with their nook and they have their own books and you can order

2124
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:43.190
them online.

2125
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.610
Basically the same thing that Amazon does or does this transitionary period.

2126
00:59:46.611 --> 00:59:47.361
But you know,

2127
00:59:47.361 --> 00:59:47.601
don't,

2128
00:59:47.601 --> 00:59:49.640
don't fucking go after other companies like that.

2129
00:59:49.641 --> 00:59:50.474
That's stupid.

2130
00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:51.410
Someone,

2131
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:52.161
the stupid thing is,

2132
00:59:52.161 --> 00:59:53.360
I had a bunch of my readers who were like,

2133
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:55.970
I went into Barnes and to hold to get it and they said they didn't have it,

2134
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:56.930
so I just order it on Amazon.

2135
00:59:57.130 --> 00:59:57.561
I'm like,

2136
00:59:57.561 --> 00:59:57.860
yeah,

2137
00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:59.390
of course that's what's going to happen.

2138
00:59:59.391 --> 01:00:01.100
It makes it more money for Amazon.

2139
01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:01.920
You dummies,

2140
01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:04.150
except you can't be a constant.

2141
01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:04.731
This world,

2142
01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:04.980
it's,

2143
01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.450
it's,

2144
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:06.620
it's too late for that.

2145
01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.430
You can't just do that because they'd all send,

2146
01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:11.990
people hear about it like you telling it on this podcast,

2147
01:00:11.991 --> 01:00:14.870
which reaches millions of people and they're going to go fuck them.

2148
01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:17.780
And so there's a certain number of people right now that are Tim Ferriss fan

2149
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:18.051
fans like,

2150
01:00:18.051 --> 01:00:18.141
well,

2151
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:18.441
you know what?

2152
01:00:18.441 --> 01:00:19.370
Fuck Barnes and noble,

2153
01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:20.540
they can't get my business.

2154
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:21.361
What's the other one?

2155
01:00:21.361 --> 01:00:22.640
There's Barnes and noble and there's any of this,

2156
01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:23.141
the porters,

2157
01:00:23.141 --> 01:00:26.420
but does this already out it out of business gun and had done so no one exists

2158
01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:26.721
anymore.

2159
01:00:26.721 --> 01:00:27.730
It's just Barnes and noble Barnes.

2160
01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:30.540
<v 3>Well then there are a few in the middle of the country like books,</v>

2161
01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:31.710
a million they bought of me too,

2162
01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.790
but they're all there.

2163
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.730
They're all in the final death now.

2164
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:38.430
So everyone's going to be gone like record stores.

2165
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.353
It's going to be the same thing.

2166
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:41.700
I think it'll be very similar.

2167
01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:43.520
<v 0>The Amazon will rise.</v>

2168
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.290
Phoenix from the ashes.

2169
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:46.890
<v 3>What,</v>

2170
01:00:46.890 --> 01:00:47.190
what,

2171
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:52.190
what will continue to succeed are bookstores that offer one,

2172
01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:54.380
a handful of things.

2173
01:00:54.381 --> 01:00:54.921
Number one,

2174
01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:56.990
books that are actually tactile experiences,

2175
01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:00.440
beautiful books that cannot be replicated in digital.

2176
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:01.191
And I think for instance,

2177
01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:01.310
I,

2178
01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:05.180
the four hour chef I think is the ironic part of the whole thing is actually a

2179
01:01:05.181 --> 01:01:05.991
beautiful book.

2180
01:01:05.991 --> 01:01:06.860
It's better if physical,

2181
01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:07.733
the digital,

2182
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.230
but uh,

2183
01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:09.830
I think,

2184
01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:10.370
uh,

2185
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:13.390
like fade on their number of publishers that create really beautiful books and

2186
01:01:13.391 --> 01:01:14.540
they will continue to do well.

2187
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.560
The second is for instances,

2188
01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.710
bookstore in San Francisco called omnivore books.

2189
01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:20.060
It's only cookbooks.

2190
01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:25.250
And you walk in there and that person is the Obi wan Kenobi of cookbooks.

2191
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:26.210
They will be like,

2192
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:27.710
tell me five things you're interested in.

2193
01:01:27.711 --> 01:01:30.410
I will pick the perfect cookbook from the last 200 years for you.

2194
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.090
And you're like,

2195
01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:31.400
oh,

2196
01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.750
208 years.

2197
01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:33.000
Oh,

2198
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:33.620
they've everything.

2199
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.120
Like half of their books are out of print.

2200
01:01:35.121 --> 01:01:36.050
It's fucking awesome.

2201
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:36.470
Wow.

2202
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.060
It's Omnivore.

2203
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:39.290
It's Rad.

2204
01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:39.861
There's another one.

2205
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:40.694
Uh,

2206
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.440
let me get this right.

2207
01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:41.660
Uh,

2208
01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:43.400
Slotnick cookbooks,

2209
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:44.171

New York City,

2213
01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:46.600
same story like this.

2214
01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:48.320
The woman only thinks,

2215
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:48.921
eats,

2216
01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:49.550
breathes,

2217
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:50.450
believes cookbooks.

2218
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.680
She knows everything there is to know.

2219
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:52.281
So you go there,

2220
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:53.390
it's like the Mecca of cookbooks.

2221
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:54.700
<v 0>I saw there's a,</v>

2222
01:01:54.701 --> 01:01:57.880
there's one on Anthony Bourdain's show he went to in New York.

2223
01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:59.170
I always had to be her.

2224
01:01:59.370 --> 01:01:59.710
It was,

2225
01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:01.430
it had to be as fascinating.

2226
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:02.680
He goes to them the,

2227
01:02:02.681 --> 01:02:05.050
apparently there's a few all throughout the world.

2228
01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:06.400
He goes to them,

2229
01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:06.670
you know,

2230
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:07.590
whenever he's on the road,

2231
01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:10.640
he goes to different cookbooks stores and buys these,

2232
01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:10.750
yeah.

2233
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:12.040
<v 3>Ancient cookbooks.</v>

2234
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:12.913
Really fascinating.

2235
01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.790
So fun cause they have these,

2236
01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:17.230
these fantastic ones that are like the gentleman league,

2237
01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:18.430
I've to cookery or whatever.

2238
01:02:18.431 --> 01:02:23.410
Like these like quaint but awesomely accurate stereotype typical books or you

2239
01:02:23.411 --> 01:02:25.100
read it and you're like that's still accurate.

2240
01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:27.490
All like 1930 or whatever.

2241
01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.240
It's great.

2242
01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.320
There's so fantastic.

2243
01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:32.770
I wish we could have recorded those freaks and see what they sounded like when

2244
01:02:32.771 --> 01:02:34.870
they were just walking around and talking like a reality show.

2245
01:02:34.871 --> 01:02:37.450
I went to go live in the thirties you know,

2246
01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.330
I mean wouldn't be interesting cause if they,

2247
01:02:40.331 --> 01:02:44.260
if they look back at the future and judge us by real housewives of Miami,

2248
01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:45.240
Oh God,

2249
01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.073
fuck.

2250
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:49.090
I would like to know what these people were really like.

2251
01:02:49.150 --> 01:02:49.983
You know,

2252
01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:51.491
it has to be,

2253
01:02:51.491 --> 01:02:52.900
I mean they weren't the movies,

2254
01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.220
they weren't logged gable,

2255
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:54.730
you know,

2256
01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:55.563
they weren't that.

2257
01:02:55.570 --> 01:02:56.040
So what,

2258
01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.160
what were they like?

2259
01:02:57.161 --> 01:02:57.311
Yeah.

2260
01:02:57.311 --> 01:03:02.311
Well I wish I could see a documentary on people that live back then I met,

2261
01:03:02.650 --> 01:03:04.440
<v 5>I met this military dude the other day,</v>

2262
01:03:04.441 --> 01:03:04.681
Joe,

2263
01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:09.681
that he said that his friend is really high up in the navy or something like

2264
01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:10.111
that.

2265
01:03:10.111 --> 01:03:10.250
You know,

2266
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:11.670
you shouldn't even be telling me this.

2267
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:16.860
And his friends starting to go crazy or something and he wants to talk,

2268
01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:21.090
he wants to come on this podcast because he says that he has like he's really

2269
01:03:21.091 --> 01:03:25.110
high up and he has seen these chairs that the military uses that you sit down

2270
01:03:25.111 --> 01:03:25.590
and,

2271
01:03:25.590 --> 01:03:29.190
and it kind of like goes into the future and uh,

2272
01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:31.650
they could then use that to see,

2273
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:32.220
uh,

2274
01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:35.400
how to like react and wars.

2275
01:03:35.401 --> 01:03:40.170
Like they see wars in the future and then they build stuff to fight these wars

2276
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:41.270
in the future or something.

2277
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.520
<v 3>Who taught you to a retard buddy to a good dude who's just really dumb and make</v>

2278
01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:52.320
shit up and he fucked with your head and then who you are repeating it online

2279
01:03:52.321 --> 01:03:52.741
and he's like,

2280
01:03:52.741 --> 01:03:54.070
you got a strong

2281
01:03:56.130 --> 01:03:58.430
incepted I made a boo you Brian Rear bench.

2282
01:03:58.431 --> 01:03:59.191
We'll fucking stupid.

2283
01:03:59.191 --> 01:04:02.000
He actually talked about on the podcast but I,

2284
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:07.040
but actually just to try to tag that to something that we mentioned just before

2285
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:08.740
we,

2286
01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:10.000
we went live the,

2287
01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.060
we were talking about the hate this label.

2288
01:04:12.061 --> 01:04:14.790
I can't think of a better way to explain it to like the psychic imprint of

2289
01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:15.624
events.

2290
01:04:15.820 --> 01:04:16.653
We were talking about this.

2291
01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:19.590
So let's see what we were talking about.

2292
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:23.010
We're talking about the possibility that the Rupert Sheldrake,

2293
01:04:23.011 --> 01:04:26.070
I think it was the guy who came up with this idea that everything has a memory

2294
01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:30.390
and that very specific intense events in a certain area can leave some sort of a

2295
01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:31.230
psychic imprint.

2296
01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:31.860
Correct.

2297
01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:33.420
So that's the,

2298
01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.770
that's the theory right now.

2299
01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:35.883
Uh,

2300
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:36.570
I'm,

2301
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.950
I'm naturally a skeptic.

2302
01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:39.660
I think people should be skeptical.

2303
01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.290
But one of the reasons I went to a,

2304
01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:43.620
and if I've told this before,

2305
01:04:43.621 --> 01:04:44.071
stop me,

2306
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:44.430
but I've,

2307
01:04:44.430 --> 01:04:45.150
I've had wait,

2308
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:47.560
wait too much bulletproof and coconut waters stop.

2309
01:04:47.561 --> 01:04:48.394
Now.

2310
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.570
A part of the reason I went to Princeton Undergrad is because they had this

2311
01:04:51.571 --> 01:04:52.660
place called the scientists,

2312
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:55.170
the scientific anomalies laboratory.

2313
01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.690
It was run by a guy named professor John,

2314
01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:02.100
and they had a lot of the top statisticians and mathematicians working on

2315
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:05.130
investigating unexplained phenomena,

2316
01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:08.850
including very specifically things they could test in a lab,

2317
01:05:08.851 --> 01:05:09.690
like telekinesis,

2318
01:05:09.691 --> 01:05:10.920
moving objects with your mind,

2319
01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.390
etc. Uh,

2320
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:13.253
and,

2321
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:13.890
uh,

2322
01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:15.030
different types of clairvoyants,

2323
01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:16.290
which they called remote viewing.

2324
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:16.910
So the,

2325
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:18.790
the anecdote that I now went to their lab,

2326
01:05:18.791 --> 01:05:19.900
I looked at their testing equipment,

2327
01:05:19.901 --> 01:05:20.651
who was awesome.

2328
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:21.400
Like they had this huge,

2329
01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:22.660
you know what a Pachinko machine is.

2330
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:26.680
It's like a verb vertical pinball machine in Japan and it shoots balls up and

2331
01:05:26.681 --> 01:05:26.950
they,

2332
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:27.250
they,

2333
01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.190
they bounced down on these pegs and you try to get them into these slots and you

2334
01:05:30.191 --> 01:05:30.430
can make,

2335
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:31.360
you can win money.

2336
01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:32.650
It's hugely popular game.

2337
01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:35.010
They had an enormous version of this.

2338
01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:39.820
It was about 10 or 15 feet tall with hundreds of these pegs that were there were

2339
01:05:39.821 --> 01:05:43.720
meticulously evenly spaced and it was divided down the middle.

2340
01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:44.530
Uh,

2341
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:49.030
and these balls would shoot at the top and subjects would have to consciously

2342
01:05:49.031 --> 01:05:50.920
direct the ball to one side or the other.

2343
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:55.150
And then they would look at the statistical probability of a split one way or

2344
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:55.984
the other.

2345
01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:56.883
Uh,

2346
01:05:57.030 --> 01:05:57.490
uh,

2347
01:05:57.490 --> 01:05:59.200
they did a lot of really fascinating stuff,

2348
01:05:59.230 --> 01:05:59.741
but it was,

2349
01:05:59.741 --> 01:06:03.280
it was well funded at one point by some of the defense industry.

2350
01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:05.050
So the remote viewing,

2351
01:06:05.051 --> 01:06:05.710
this is the,

2352
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:07.600
this is where I'm coming to the psychic imprint part.

2353
01:06:08.350 --> 01:06:09.880
The way this works is,

2354
01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:10.480
uh,

2355
01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:15.480
they would have a number of envelopes and a transmitter.

2356
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:19.180
This is the person who would then take one of the envelopes along with a number

2357
01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:20.170
of the experimenters,

2358
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:24.400
open it up after they'd left the room and it would have gps coordinates,

2359
01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:28.570
they would travel to a specific location and his job was to transmit to the

2360
01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:29.200
receiver.

2361
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:29.980
So you would look at,

2362
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.250
look at the scene and transmit that visual scene to the receiver who's a

2363
01:06:33.251 --> 01:06:35.170
separate person sitting in a room,

2364
01:06:35.260 --> 01:06:35.981
pad of paper,

2365
01:06:35.981 --> 01:06:36.791
a voice recorder,

2366
01:06:36.791 --> 01:06:37.041
pen,

2367
01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:37.874
et Cetera.

2368
01:06:38.980 --> 01:06:39.813
And uh,

2369
01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:41.380
it's when they,

2370
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:41.741
and by,

2371
01:06:41.741 --> 01:06:43.090
when you say transmit,

2372
01:06:43.091 --> 01:06:45.160
let's explain to people what remote viewing.

2373
01:06:45.161 --> 01:06:45.400
Yes.

2374
01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.900
A means no phone.

2375
01:06:46.930 --> 01:06:47.501
There's no phone,

2376
01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:47.861
there's nothing.

2377
01:06:47.861 --> 01:06:48.311
Basically,

2378
01:06:48.311 --> 01:06:51.760
like if I were looking at you right now and I trying to send an image of

2379
01:06:51.761 --> 01:06:55.360
everything that I see to someone like a hundred miles away for them to write,

2380
01:06:55.690 --> 01:07:00.090
sketch it down on a piece of paper and the,

2381
01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:05.220
it has some pretty potentially amazing applications to intelligence gathering,

2382
01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:05.831
military,

2383
01:07:05.831 --> 01:07:06.664
whatever.

2384
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:07.900
So what the,

2385
01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.550
when Professor John,

2386
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.520
I landed at uh,

2387
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:11.800
I guess 1995,

2388
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:14.140
96 at Princeton and they were just,

2389
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:14.450
uh,

2390
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:17.850
I think a year later shutting down the scientific anomalies laboratory because

2391
01:07:17.851 --> 01:07:18.291
the cold war,

2392
01:07:18.291 --> 01:07:19.690
it was over like there wasn't enough funding,

2393
01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:20.010
whatever.

2394
01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:20.321
And he's like,

2395
01:07:20.321 --> 01:07:20.980
all right,

2396
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.700
I'm going to give you like the final wrap up presentation with some of the data

2397
01:07:24.701 --> 01:07:26.860
that we've seen just to blow your mind.

2398
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:27.251
And he's like,

2399
01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:30.280
I don't expect people to change how anybody thinks about this because there's a

2400
01:07:30.281 --> 01:07:32.500
lot of stigma associated with some of these phenomena.

2401
01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:36.640
But let me tell you what some of the things we've seen and told the story of

2402
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.280
using four or five of the same locations for remote,

2403
01:07:39.281 --> 01:07:40.150
you don't have to say travel out.

2404
01:07:40.151 --> 01:07:42.070
And it was always the same like gas station or whatever.

2405
01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:47.020
And at one point they had this collection of drawings from receivers who had

2406
01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:50.970
proven themselves to be pretty adept at this stuff that uh,

2407
01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.400
all looked the same for this one gas station,

2408
01:07:54.460 --> 01:07:55.480
but it wasn't a gas station.

2409
01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:59.830
And what they found out later when they did background research on the location

2410
01:07:59.831 --> 01:08:01.060
is that the,

2411
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:06.390
the receivers had been drawing barracks that existed at the exact location of

2412
01:08:06.581 --> 01:08:10.240
the gas station like a hundred years before in that crazy.

2413
01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:11.903
Why?

2414
01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:13.710
So in other words,

2415
01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:16.250
images that they had drawn all the same

2416
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.140
<v 0>and they were all of these barracks</v>

2417
01:08:18.270 --> 01:08:18.751
<v 3>correct.</v>

2418
01:08:18.751 --> 01:08:22.950
The data existed at the exact same location that now had a gas station that this

2419
01:08:22.951 --> 01:08:23.850
guy had been transmitting.

2420
01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:29.180
So it called into question sort of some really fascinating it sort of time

2421
01:08:30.001 --> 01:08:30.990
continuum questions.

2422
01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:31.650
Right.

2423
01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:32.011
So it's like,

2424
01:08:32.011 --> 01:08:33.900
if you can see the past in the same sense,

2425
01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:34.640
like,

2426
01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.960
and then we're getting into all sorts of wacky physics and Stephen Hawking

2427
01:08:37.961 --> 01:08:38.251
stuff.

2428
01:08:38.251 --> 01:08:41.250
But I just found that really fascinating.

2429
01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:43.270
<v 0>This is this something they made?</v>

2430
01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.430
This was in a presentation.

2431
01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.940
They made a presentation that's available

2432
01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.730
<v 3>98 this was in [inaudible] 90.</v>

2433
01:08:47.731 --> 01:08:48.060
Uh,

2434
01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:48.781
people can look it up.

2435
01:08:48.781 --> 01:08:50.610
I'm not sure if they'd be able to find a recording.

2436
01:08:50.611 --> 01:08:51.240
I would love,

2437
01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:51.451
I mean,

2438
01:08:51.451 --> 01:08:52.740
I'd love to watch it again if I could.

2439
01:08:52.741 --> 01:08:54.900
It was j a h n Professor John.

2440
01:08:54.901 --> 01:08:55.411
You see,

2441
01:08:55.411 --> 01:08:56.880
what are the images for corrected people?

2442
01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:57.220
Drew,

2443
01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:00.870
how similar hand sketched similar enough that you could tell they were drawing

2444
01:09:00.871 --> 01:09:01.500
the same thing.

2445
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:02.101
I mean it wasn't,

2446
01:09:02.101 --> 01:09:03.610
we're not talking about uh,

2447
01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:08.130
take photograph fidelity because these people weren't trained artists,

2448
01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:08.880
scientists.

2449
01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:09.360
Uh,

2450
01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:10.680
but ah,

2451
01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:11.671
yeah,

2452
01:09:11.671 --> 01:09:12.970
there's some wacky stuff out there.

2453
01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:13.970
There's some really

2454
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:15.680
<v 0>that's the wackiest it's pretty intense.</v>

2455
01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:16.380
Yeah.

2456
01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:21.080
That seems like just the fact that they drew what can be reasonably interpreted

2457
01:09:21.081 --> 01:09:22.370
as the same image.

2458
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:23.263
Yeah,

2459
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:24.283
pretty cool.

2460
01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:25.700
Pretty Weird.

2461
01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:26.031
Yeah.

2462
01:09:26.031 --> 01:09:26.700
Pretty Weird.

2463
01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.100
I don't discount ghosts fully.

2464
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.301
I mean,

2465
01:09:29.301 --> 01:09:30.250
people have said like,

2466
01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:30.670
you know,

2467
01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.970
like one of those guys from those ghost hunter shows.

2468
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:34.100
I absolutely,

2469
01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:34.851
he was like,

2470
01:09:34.851 --> 01:09:35.061
you know,

2471
01:09:35.061 --> 01:09:35.960
I heard you're a skeptic.

2472
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:36.770
Yeah.

2473
01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:37.220
That,

2474
01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:37.940
yes.

2475
01:09:37.940 --> 01:09:41.180
But discounting the idea of something,

2476
01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:42.140
some image,

2477
01:09:42.141 --> 01:09:47.141
some imprint of a moment that's stuck in the same geographic area that make

2478
01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.930
blink in and out of existence.

2479
01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:51.950
I don't,

2480
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:52.300
I mean,

2481
01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.990
I explained talking,

2482
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.071
explain,

2483
01:09:55.071 --> 01:09:59.570
making noises and the other person that has images in their mind that coincide

2484
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:01.130
with those noises and you agree,

2485
01:10:01.131 --> 01:10:02.900
even though everybody's voice sounds differently,

2486
01:10:02.901 --> 01:10:03.850
we all agree on like a,

2487
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:08.870
a similar hard soft combination of that represent actual all that fucking nuts.

2488
01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:11.060
The Internet's nuts.

2489
01:10:11.300 --> 01:10:12.140
Everything's nuts.

2490
01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:14.960
Ghosts aren't any crazier than TV.

2491
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.910
TV's pretty fucking crazy.

2492
01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:17.571
You know,

2493
01:10:17.571 --> 01:10:20.990
the fact that you can broadcast and they figure this shit out a long ass time

2494
01:10:20.991 --> 01:10:21.500
ago.

2495
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.920
At the same time everyone in the country can watch the same image that's going

2496
01:10:24.921 --> 01:10:25.940
through the space.

2497
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.360
Yeah.

2498
01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.860
That's pretty fucking weird.

2499
01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:28.491
You know,

2500
01:10:28.491 --> 01:10:28.671
the,

2501
01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:30.560
the ghosts aren't any weirder than that.

2502
01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:31.790
It's a lot less weird.

2503
01:10:31.870 --> 01:10:32.890
There are local,

2504
01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:34.460
they there in that one area,

2505
01:10:34.461 --> 01:10:36.290
they don't travel around and you know,

2506
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:37.081
<v 3>it's,</v>

2507
01:10:37.081 --> 01:10:37.321
yeah,

2508
01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:37.831
I mean,

2509
01:10:37.831 --> 01:10:38.370
I don't,

2510
01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:39.203
uh,

2511
01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:43.530
I think you hit the nail on a wall that's just me being like conclusive where I

2512
01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:43.891
shouldn't be.

2513
01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:47.910
But I think that the point you made that's really important is that it might not

2514
01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:49.680
be an entity of any type.

2515
01:10:49.681 --> 01:10:49.950
Right.

2516
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:50.970
It may not have any,

2517
01:10:50.971 --> 01:10:52.470
it may not be a sentient being.

2518
01:10:52.471 --> 01:10:53.370
Like the ghost isn't like,

2519
01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:53.581
Oh,

2520
01:10:53.581 --> 01:10:54.091
I'm hungry,

2521
01:10:54.091 --> 01:10:54.541
I need to go,

2522
01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:54.721
blah,

2523
01:10:54.721 --> 01:10:54.841
blah,

2524
01:10:54.841 --> 01:10:55.020
blah.

2525
01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:55.201
No,

2526
01:10:55.201 --> 01:11:00.201
but if there's a traumatic or intense event that leaves some type of residual

2527
01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:02.520
trace that you can pick up.

2528
01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:03.990
I give you an example.

2529
01:11:03.991 --> 01:11:07.020
I went to San Diego to Ted Med,

2530
01:11:07.021 --> 01:11:07.621
this is many,

2531
01:11:07.621 --> 01:11:08.161
many years ago.

2532
01:11:08.161 --> 01:11:09.660
I went to one of the earlier tedmeds,

2533
01:11:09.661 --> 01:11:13.410
which Ted for medical innovation and conversation.

2534
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:13.950
Great,

2535
01:11:13.950 --> 01:11:14.611
great event.

2536
01:11:14.611 --> 01:11:16.230
But we stayed at the,

2537
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.650
uh,

2538
01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:19.440
core Natto hotel or core Natto in,

2539
01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.400
in,

2540
01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:20.610
uh,

2541
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.443
San Diego.

2542
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:24.390
And I stayed there.

2543
01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:27.150
I was there the first night and I was really fucking cold.

2544
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:30.690
It was warm out and I was freezing in my room and I was just like,

2545
01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:31.524
I couldn't sleep.

2546
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:32.191
It was super,

2547
01:11:32.191 --> 01:11:33.024
super cold.

2548
01:11:33.450 --> 01:11:36.390
Next morning guide delivers breakfast and he goes,

2549
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.253
oh,

2550
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:38.183
uh,

2551
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:39.011
how'd you sleep?

2552
01:11:39.011 --> 01:11:39.800
Do you see any ghosts?

2553
01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:40.081
I was like,

2554
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:40.710
what?

2555
01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:41.191
Excuse me?

2556
01:11:41.191 --> 01:11:41.550
And he goes,

2557
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.791
oh,

2558
01:11:41.791 --> 01:11:41.930
no.

2559
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:45.180
It's always really famous for ghosts because this woman hung herself in the room

2560
01:11:45.181 --> 01:11:45.781
next to yours.

2561
01:11:45.781 --> 01:11:46.614
You didn't notice that there,

2562
01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:48.270
the door was painted over.

2563
01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:48.750
And I'm just like,

2564
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:49.583
fuck,

2565
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.400
you know,

2566
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.290
it didn't make it any easier to sleep after that.

2567
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:53.760
The Deloitte was painted over.

2568
01:11:53.761 --> 01:11:55.230
What do you mean they didn't use the room?

2569
01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:56.400
Cause the woman hung herself in it.

2570
01:11:56.401 --> 01:11:57.234
So they painted,

2571
01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.090
they painted over the creases in the door so it couldn't be oh,

2572
01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:00.361
uh,

2573
01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:00.970
open.

2574
01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:01.560
Uh,

2575
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:03.040
they sealed the door paint.

2576
01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:05.160
That's what it looked like.

2577
01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:05.550
Yeah.

2578
01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:06.390
And it was painted over.

2579
01:12:06.391 --> 01:12:08.650
I not only they locked it and then painted it over because people wouldn't drink

2580
01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:09.990
old school paint,

2581
01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:10.883
I guess.

2582
01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.290
Doors used to get stuck when you painted them.

2583
01:12:14.210 --> 01:12:14.970
And uh,

2584
01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:19.350
but I knew nothing of that when I stayed there the night before and I was like

2585
01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:22.080
freezing cold and could not sleep at all.

2586
01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:23.130
And it was hot out.

2587
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:24.900
It was just a weird experience.

2588
01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:26.430
And then only found out after the fact.

2589
01:12:26.431 --> 01:12:26.611
It's like,

2590
01:12:26.611 --> 01:12:26.881
oh yeah,

2591
01:12:26.881 --> 01:12:27.810
somebody commits suicide.

2592
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:30.140
Dead Lady laying on top of you,

2593
01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:31.740
like dry humping you while you're trying to,

2594
01:12:31.741 --> 01:12:32.251
could have been.

2595
01:12:32.251 --> 01:12:32.700
Yeah,

2596
01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.241
it could've been.

2597
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:34.074
Exactly.

2598
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:35.000
Yeah.

2599
01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:35.833
<v 0>I don't,</v>

2600
01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:40.670
I don't discount the idea of ghosts because to me it's not any crazier than sons

2601
01:12:40.671 --> 01:12:45.140
or any crazier than black holes or hyper of us.

2602
01:12:45.141 --> 01:12:47.150
All that stuff's way nuttier than a ghost,

2603
01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:48.320
you know?

2604
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.153
You know what I mean?

2605
01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:51.140
Like the things that we actually do exist.

2606
01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:55.730
It's just the real problem is so many people are full of shit.

2607
01:12:55.940 --> 01:12:57.080
That's the real problem.

2608
01:12:57.081 --> 01:13:02.081
The real problem with any of the data when it comes to any paranormal and

2609
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:07.870
anything weird and French is that so many people have shitty thinking.

2610
01:13:08.330 --> 01:13:13.330
They have massive confirmation bias and they're dumb and they tell lies.

2611
01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:17.000
They'll just make up stories about being abducted by aliens and you know,

2612
01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:17.870
listening to him like,

2613
01:13:17.871 --> 01:13:18.201
man,

2614
01:13:18.201 --> 01:13:18.921
I don't know.

2615
01:13:18.921 --> 01:13:19.880
And you know,

2616
01:13:19.881 --> 01:13:20.930
I was one friend's like,

2617
01:13:20.931 --> 01:13:21.141
dude,

2618
01:13:21.141 --> 01:13:22.910
this guy fucking worked for the government man.

2619
01:13:22.911 --> 01:13:23.451
Like this guy.

2620
01:13:23.451 --> 01:13:23.990
He knows.

2621
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.291
And I'm like,

2622
01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:24.561
man,

2623
01:13:24.561 --> 01:13:25.520
he might not know.

2624
01:13:25.521 --> 01:13:25.701
Like,

2625
01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:25.911
look,

2626
01:13:25.911 --> 01:13:27.740
he seems like he's full of shit to me.

2627
01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:28.401
You know?

2628
01:13:28.401 --> 01:13:29.510
It's like God dammit.

2629
01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:35.630
There's no way that you can tell me though that everybody,

2630
01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:40.660
every single person that's experienced some sort of a supernatural phenomenon is

2631
01:13:41.331 --> 01:13:41.701
crazy.

2632
01:13:41.701 --> 01:13:42.534
Are full of Shit.

2633
01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:47.680
I think it's just a matter of like sifting through massive amounts of data and

2634
01:13:47.781 --> 01:13:48.740
getting to these like,

2635
01:13:48.741 --> 01:13:49.220
okay,

2636
01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.210
what is that a diamond?

2637
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:51.290
Look at that.

2638
01:13:51.290 --> 01:13:51.921
That's a diamond.

2639
01:13:51.921 --> 01:13:52.990
Put that there cliff.

2640
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.691
Okay,

2641
01:13:53.691 --> 01:13:54.440
let's look at all this stuff.

2642
01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:54.531
Oh,

2643
01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:54.860
it says,

2644
01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:55.693
what's this right here?

2645
01:13:55.850 --> 01:13:56.683
Look at that.

2646
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:57.620
Put that over there.

2647
01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:02.390
Click when you're just going to have a fucking river of bullshit though,

2648
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.690
they're going to have to dig your hand in and pull out the diamonds because most

2649
01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:06.620
of it's going to be crap.

2650
01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.690
That's the real problem with ghost stories.

2651
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:09.950
A real problem with everything.

2652
01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.003
<v 1>I mean it's,</v>

2653
01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:17.480
there's so much bullshit along with potentially credible data that it just all

2654
01:14:17.851 --> 01:14:18.684
gets thrown out.

2655
01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:19.141
You know,

2656
01:14:19.141 --> 01:14:19.351
we,

2657
01:14:19.351 --> 01:14:19.590
we,

2658
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:21.560
we are in a weird time as,

2659
01:14:21.561 --> 01:14:23.760
as an organism and I think that's ineffective.

2660
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:25.770
It's very effective to communicate with words,

2661
01:14:25.771 --> 01:14:27.960
but it's also very ineffective cause people can lie.

2662
01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:29.453
And that isn't,

2663
01:14:29.540 --> 01:14:31.110
I think that's a temporary thing.

2664
01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:33.150
I don't think that's gonna be around much longer.

2665
01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:36.180
And I think once that's not around anymore,

2666
01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:39.360
once you can really understand what this person's saying immediately when

2667
01:14:39.361 --> 01:14:39.921
they're saying it,

2668
01:14:39.921 --> 01:14:42.000
it's not going to be as simple as being able to lie.

2669
01:14:42.001 --> 01:14:42.430
It's going to be,

2670
01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:42.690
I'll,

2671
01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:42.960
I'll,

2672
01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:45.200
I'll know what you're thinking when you're saying something.

2673
01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:45.500
Well,

2674
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:47.730
we'll have a much deeper insight into each other.

2675
01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.480
Then all this ghost stuff becomes really interesting because then if you tell me

2676
01:14:53.761 --> 01:14:54.660
a ghost story,

2677
01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.580
I know it's fucking real.

2678
01:14:56.670 --> 01:14:58.200
If you tell me you saw a Sasquatch,

2679
01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:01.380
I know you fucking saw Sasquatch and I know there's a God damn big foot out

2680
01:15:01.381 --> 01:15:01.860
there.

2681
01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.430
I know that an alien ship landed in your,

2682
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:05.303
I know,

2683
01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:05.881
but right now,

2684
01:15:05.881 --> 01:15:06.510
I don't know.

2685
01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:10.740
Right now I've got this clunky thing called language and a lot of people abuse

2686
01:15:10.741 --> 01:15:11.400
it and they don't,

2687
01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.550
they don't tell the fucking truth or they're crazy.

2688
01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:15.483
That too.

2689
01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:15.961
You know,

2690
01:15:15.961 --> 01:15:16.771
they might tell the truth,

2691
01:15:16.771 --> 01:15:17.311
but their truth,

2692
01:15:17.311 --> 01:15:18.960
it's fucking Mickey Mouse is flying,

2693
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:19.411
you know,

2694
01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:20.790
a harp and it's a,

2695
01:15:20.791 --> 01:15:21.091
you know,

2696
01:15:21.091 --> 01:15:21.621
he's boom,

2697
01:15:21.621 --> 01:15:21.871
boom,

2698
01:15:21.871 --> 01:15:23.460
doom over your house with the harp.

2699
01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.031
Like,

2700
01:15:24.031 --> 01:15:24.301
yeah,

2701
01:15:24.301 --> 01:15:24.991
it's real.

2702
01:15:24.991 --> 01:15:28.230
Like to hook them up to a lie detector could probably tell you it actually

2703
01:15:28.231 --> 01:15:29.064
happened.

2704
01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:32.610
I wonder if people would be able to get to the deep conversations to that

2705
01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:33.990
stabbing each other first though,

2706
01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:34.950
if they were totally honest.

2707
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:35.281
You know what I mean?

2708
01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:38.160
Like there's going to be a transitionary period like the rat,

2709
01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.480
I don't know if you've ever heard of this,

2710
01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:40.020
uh,

2711
01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.670
this movement called radical honesty.

2712
01:15:41.671 --> 01:15:42.504
Have you ever seen this guy?

2713
01:15:42.930 --> 01:15:43.763
Sorry,

2714
01:15:43.770 --> 01:15:44.581
where are you supposed to be?

2715
01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:48.210
100% honest about everything you're feeling and thinking in the moment.

2716
01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:52.050
And so a friend of mine named h Jay Jacobs,

2717
01:15:52.051 --> 01:15:53.640
he's a really funny writer.

2718
01:15:53.641 --> 01:15:55.980
He wrote a book called the Year of Living Biblically,

2719
01:15:55.981 --> 01:15:59.910
where he tried to follow every rule in the old and New Testament for an entire

2720
01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:00.270
year.

2721
01:16:00.270 --> 01:16:00.691
It's a,

2722
01:16:00.691 --> 01:16:01.620
it's an amazing book,

2723
01:16:01.621 --> 01:16:03.600
including stoning adulterers because he was like,

2724
01:16:03.630 --> 01:16:04.140
fuck,

2725
01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.190
I need to stone adulterers.

2726
01:16:05.191 --> 01:16:06.120
But I don't want to kill somebody.

2727
01:16:06.330 --> 01:16:07.950
They don't specify the size of the stone.

2728
01:16:07.951 --> 01:16:08.820
So he had like a pocket,

2729
01:16:08.821 --> 01:16:09.960
like he wore a white robe,

2730
01:16:09.961 --> 01:16:12.060
huge beard pocket full of these little pebbles.

2731
01:16:12.061 --> 01:16:14.400
And he walked around central park asking people if they were adulterers and they

2732
01:16:14.401 --> 01:16:15.820
need stone them with these pebbles and run away.

2733
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:16.654
But

2734
01:16:18.650 --> 01:16:19.483
<v 3>yeah,</v>

2735
01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.400
it looks like he's looking to get his ass kicked.

2736
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:22.071
Oh yeah.

2737
01:16:22.071 --> 01:16:22.241
Yeah.

2738
01:16:22.241 --> 01:16:22.461
He,

2739
01:16:22.461 --> 01:16:22.890
he's,

2740
01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:23.711
he throw a rocket.

2741
01:16:23.711 --> 01:16:25.840
Somebody you can find the wrong dude.

2742
01:16:25.841 --> 01:16:27.070
Just got fired.

2743
01:16:27.071 --> 01:16:28.920
His wife just got a nail or whatever,

2744
01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:29.763
go to jail.

2745
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:31.030
He throw a little rocket and you,

2746
01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:32.200
I beat the fuck out of you.

2747
01:16:32.201 --> 01:16:33.790
So one of the other experiments,

2748
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:34.683
that agent,

2749
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:35.703
<v 1>not a big guy,</v>

2750
01:16:35.710 --> 01:16:40.270
one of the experiments that hey did was radical honesty for I think a month.

2751
01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:41.890
And it was called,

2752
01:16:41.891 --> 01:16:42.730
I think you're fat.

2753
01:16:43.210 --> 01:16:43.751
<v 3>Oh,</v>

2754
01:16:43.751 --> 01:16:44.531
that was the title.

2755
01:16:44.531 --> 01:16:46.540
That was the title of the article for Esquire.

2756
01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:47.690
And so he,

2757
01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:49.720
so he'd be talking to his wife and she'd be like,

2758
01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:50.230
blah,

2759
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:50.890
blah blah,

2760
01:16:50.890 --> 01:16:51.351
don't you think?

2761
01:16:51.351 --> 01:16:51.701
And He'd be like,

2762
01:16:51.701 --> 01:16:52.300
I'm sorry,

2763
01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:52.931
I'm really bored.

2764
01:16:52.931 --> 01:16:54.130
And I stopped listening five minutes ago.

2765
01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:57.070
Oh yeah.

2766
01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.080
Has not radical honesty.

2767
01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:01.080
That's being a douchebag part.

2768
01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:02.231
Yeah,

2769
01:17:02.231 --> 01:17:03.340
you do think those things.

2770
01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:07.210
But the reality is part of being a nice person is when you love somebody,

2771
01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:08.940
you let them talk and you actually listened to them.

2772
01:17:08.950 --> 01:17:09.200
Yeah.

2773
01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:09.980
And when you don't do

2774
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:10.191
<v 0>that,</v>

2775
01:17:10.191 --> 01:17:11.480
it's kind of a country thank deal.

2776
01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:14.240
Cause you could listen to them and then you know,

2777
01:17:14.241 --> 01:17:16.580
you decide whether or not you actually have anything in common.

2778
01:17:16.581 --> 01:17:19.190
But some people they shut that shit off a long time ago.

2779
01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:19.400
Right.

2780
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.080
And I talk at you when I'm done,

2781
01:17:21.081 --> 01:17:21.914
you talk at me,

2782
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:24.260
but no one's really talking to each other because I'm not listening to what the

2783
01:17:24.261 --> 01:17:25.094
fuck you're saying.

2784
01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:26.960
That's like one of the most common traits.

2785
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:28.220
Relationships.

2786
01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.050
It's one of those common traits among humans.

2787
01:17:30.051 --> 01:17:30.680
Man,

2788
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.830
I have a really tough time and there some really cool people down here,

2789
01:17:33.831 --> 01:17:35.780
but I have a lot of trouble with la man.

2790
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.640
You should I,

2791
01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.880
San Francisco is superior.

2792
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:40.670
Well I think everybody in San Francisco has Asperger's.

2793
01:17:40.671 --> 01:17:41.840
So they just say what's on their mind,

2794
01:17:41.841 --> 01:17:43.070
whether it's appropriate or not.

2795
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:44.240
So,

2796
01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.330
which is is really refreshing but can be frustrating.

2797
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:50.060
But the converse in la,

2798
01:17:50.061 --> 01:17:50.331
man,

2799
01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:51.230
it's like Jesus,

2800
01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:54.650
like how many layers to this onion of a person have to peel back to know what

2801
01:17:54.651 --> 01:17:56.060
the fuck you're actually trying to say to me.

2802
01:17:56.061 --> 01:17:56.511
Yes,

2803
01:17:56.511 --> 01:17:57.740
that is a huge issue.

2804
01:17:57.741 --> 01:18:00.200
And it's an issue because of the entertainment industry.

2805
01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:03.830
The entertainment industry fosters bullshit because you have to pretend to be

2806
01:18:03.831 --> 01:18:06.980
something a unique and different and meanwhile you're just another fucking

2807
01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:11.390
person who's going to pretend to be a killer and a movie or pretend to be a

2808
01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:12.680
princess or pretend to be at.

2809
01:18:12.681 --> 01:18:14.720
You're pretending you're faking it.

2810
01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:17.750
So like you to be the best at it,

2811
01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:18.800
you have to be fake.

2812
01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:21.260
You have to be a big fake person's good at line.

2813
01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.420
It's really bananas.

2814
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:24.860
And not only that,

2815
01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:27.590
you start to embody this look,

2816
01:18:27.591 --> 01:18:27.860
look,

2817
01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:28.880
here's the perfect example.

2818
01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:31.280
Sean Penn is a brilliant actor.

2819
01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.360
He's very good at that.

2820
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.141
Most likely,

2821
01:18:33.141 --> 01:18:33.951
cause Sean Penn,

2822
01:18:33.951 --> 01:18:35.090
it's fucking crazy.

2823
01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:36.133
Okay.

2824
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:41.540
And Chris Rock was hosting the Academy Awards once and he was making fun of Jude

2825
01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:43.330
law about how Jude law's and everything.

2826
01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:43.831
Whenever we got,

2827
01:18:43.831 --> 01:18:44.031
Damn.

2828
01:18:44.031 --> 01:18:45.180
Can I see move without Jude law?

2829
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.153
It was pretty funny.

2830
01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:47.053
It was just joking.

2831
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:50.810
It's a subject because Jude law is very prolific and he's excellent.

2832
01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:52.280
So He's used it a lot of movies.

2833
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:55.400
So fucking Sean Penn takes the microphone afterwards and says,

2834
01:18:55.670 --> 01:18:58.460
Jude loves you know these movies because he's an amazing actor.

2835
01:18:58.760 --> 01:18:59.211
And I'm like,

2836
01:18:59.211 --> 01:18:59.511
okay,

2837
01:18:59.511 --> 01:19:01.160
I want to beat you to death.

2838
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:02.890
I want to beat you to death for,

2839
01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:08.050
for getting literal about a fucking Chris rock joke about a prolific actor.

2840
01:19:09.140 --> 01:19:10.700
Jesus Christ.

2841
01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.060
You fucking pretentious cock sucker.

2842
01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.290
Did you really say that?

2843
01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:17.180
Did you have friends at all?

2844
01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:18.890
Do you have anybody that bust your balls?

2845
01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:19.581
Do you know?

2846
01:19:19.581 --> 01:19:22.640
They take themselves so God damn seriously.

2847
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:26.960
And there were donkeys plus award show wherever where saw a monkey suit.

2848
01:19:27.190 --> 01:19:27.520
You were,

2849
01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:27.710
oh,

2850
01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:31.220
we're all gonna agree to wear the same stupid outfit that we never were for

2851
01:19:31.221 --> 01:19:32.450
being comfortable in real.

2852
01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:32.901
Yeah.

2853
01:19:32.901 --> 01:19:34.100
Why don't you put a bow tie on?

2854
01:19:34.101 --> 01:19:37.390
You can't put me there with a white shirt and oh,

2855
01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.480
buttoned up jacket.

2856
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:39.620
Are you guys rich?

2857
01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.330
Can you dress any way the fuck you want?

2858
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:42.770
Why is everybody dressing the same?

2859
01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:43.161
Oh,

2860
01:19:43.161 --> 01:19:44.510
were elegant this evening.

2861
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:46.340
Why we have traditional attire on,

2862
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:49.130
I just want to say that Jude Law's an amazing actor.

2863
01:19:49.250 --> 01:19:49.611
Yes.

2864
01:19:49.611 --> 01:19:49.821
Here,

2865
01:19:49.821 --> 01:19:50.390
here.

2866
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:54.320
Let's go back to being pretentious to Chris rock actually exposed some reality.

2867
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:55.820
Did he make fun of something?

2868
01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:56.421
No,

2869
01:19:56.421 --> 01:19:57.770
we have no room for that here.

2870
01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.360
We're helping the world,

2871
01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:00.830
but providing the arts.

2872
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:02.630
You fucking Twat.

2873
01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:04.340
I want to punch you right in your stupid face.

2874
01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:06.740
He plays like tough guys and movies.

2875
01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:07.740
We'd like,

2876
01:20:07.741 --> 01:20:08.850
this movie is pretty good.

2877
01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:10.410
It plays a Mickey Cohen and this,

2878
01:20:10.411 --> 01:20:10.651
uh,

2879
01:20:10.651 --> 01:20:12.090
this new gangster squad moment,

2880
01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.081
fun movie.

2881
01:20:13.081 --> 01:20:14.190
It looks like Horse Shit.

2882
01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:15.630
Sean Penn's very good at that,

2883
01:20:15.631 --> 01:20:18.060
but most likely he's good at that because he's fucking crazy.

2884
01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:22.770
Which is why you had to explain a joke during the Academy Awards when a fucking

2885
01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:26.340
brilliant world renounced standup comedian as the host the war.

2886
01:20:26.370 --> 01:20:28.890
Holy Shit to do a comedian make a joke.

2887
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:30.420
Oh No,

2888
01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:30.871
stop.

2889
01:20:30.871 --> 01:20:34.070
Let me explain which with a great team you're making here.

2890
01:20:35.220 --> 01:20:39.380
But I think in the same academy awards it was when Chris Rock was talking to

2891
01:20:39.381 --> 01:20:42.540
about 50 cent and said this guy's had dealt with everything.

2892
01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:45.840
He took more gunshots to the face than Jenna Jamison and they were both in the

2893
01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:46.674
audience.

2894
01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:48.570
Nobody got up and defended Jen Jamison.

2895
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.650
I was very offended.

2896
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:50.430
You're allowed.

2897
01:20:50.430 --> 01:20:51.540
You're allowed to say that.

2898
01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:52.051
Yeah,

2899
01:20:52.051 --> 01:20:53.160
you're allowed to say that.

2900
01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:56.970
But that's a free target to make fun of Jude Law because he's a brilliant

2901
01:20:56.971 --> 01:20:57.690
doctor.

2902
01:20:57.690 --> 01:21:00.600
So she butchered laws in a lot of films cause he's a brilliant doctor.

2903
01:21:00.601 --> 01:21:01.440
I just wanted to say,

2904
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:03.570
I just want her to straighten everybody out.

2905
01:21:04.170 --> 01:21:08.130
I wanted to exercise my ego about some shit that happened earlier that I thought

2906
01:21:08.131 --> 01:21:09.240
was unjust.

2907
01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:13.230
Are you making fun of June law during our special day when we were a monkey

2908
01:21:13.231 --> 01:21:14.064
suits,

2909
01:21:14.550 --> 01:21:14.920
you know,

2910
01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:16.500
fuck choke.

2911
01:21:16.501 --> 01:21:18.030
You like this one hand.

2912
01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:19.513
Are you going to,

2913
01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:19.751
Oh,

2914
01:21:19.751 --> 01:21:21.990
you'd do the scent of a woman like ranger choke.

2915
01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:24.300
I wouldn't even use my elbow.

2916
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:28.550
I wouldn't even have to just grab them like rocky,

2917
01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:30.660
like a little rat hold on tight

2918
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.821
shut.

2919
01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:33.870
It just,

2920
01:21:33.871 --> 01:21:38.100
I pretentiousness is really intolerable and it shouldn't be tolerated in your

2921
01:21:38.101 --> 01:21:40.740
friends and it shouldn't be tolerated in celebrities either.

2922
01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:41.760
That's nonsense.

2923
01:21:41.761 --> 01:21:43.200
That kind of stuff is nonsense.

2924
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:45.120
You're talking about acting cunt face.

2925
01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:45.721
Okay?

2926
01:21:45.721 --> 01:21:46.980
You're not saving the world.

2927
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.610
You're not time traveling.

2928
01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:50.550
You didn't invent a nuclear weapon.

2929
01:21:50.730 --> 01:21:51.450
Okay?

2930
01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:55.200
You know how you develop faster and intern and either and it's not like you came

2931
01:21:55.201 --> 01:21:56.040
up with five g,

2932
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:58.980
you pretended to be a gangster and a movie and you were good at it.

2933
01:21:59.020 --> 01:21:59.660
Thank you.

2934
01:21:59.660 --> 01:21:59.901
Thanks.

2935
01:21:59.901 --> 01:22:02.790
Rick did attain the main distracting me for an hour and a half cause that's all

2936
01:22:02.791 --> 01:22:03.624
the fuck you did.

2937
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:04.370
Okay.

2938
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.550
You,

2939
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:08.400
you made me sit down and I enjoyed your performance and it made me not think

2940
01:22:08.401 --> 01:22:10.380
about my life and I got some thrills out of it.

2941
01:22:10.381 --> 01:22:12.840
It was very exciting and enjoyable to follow along.

2942
01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:13.853
That's it.

2943
01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.270
That's all you did.

2944
01:22:15.271 --> 01:22:16.020
Okay.

2945
01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.790
He didn't fucking change the world.

2946
01:22:17.791 --> 01:22:18.750
You're not awesome.

2947
01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:19.590
You're guys get it.

2948
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:23.730
Pretending fuck heads drives me nuts.

2949
01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:24.511
It drives me nuts.

2950
01:22:24.511 --> 01:22:27.360
And that is the one thing that I hate about this town and you know,

2951
01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:31.820
and being a person who lives in two very real worlds,

2952
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:35.310
the world of fighting in the world of standup comedy,

2953
01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:36.930
being a cage fighting commentator,

2954
01:22:36.931 --> 01:22:39.120
I see the realist of the real shit.

2955
01:22:39.450 --> 01:22:41.370
Human character exposed,

2956
01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:42.840
people cracking under pressure.

2957
01:22:42.841 --> 01:22:43.920
People rise to the occasion.

2958
01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:45.630
I see the realist of the real shit.

2959
01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.673
And then comedy,

2960
01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:47.850
nobody laughs,

2961
01:22:47.850 --> 01:22:48.570
you're not funny.

2962
01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:48.961
Okay.

2963
01:22:48.961 --> 01:22:50.670
If your point doesn't work,

2964
01:22:50.671 --> 01:22:51.960
they don't accept it into their mind.

2965
01:22:51.961 --> 01:22:55.290
It has to really work and you have to be in that moment.

2966
01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.980
You can't think about something that's completely opposite and say something

2967
01:22:58.981 --> 01:23:01.080
funny and have it be funny cause it won't work.

2968
01:23:01.200 --> 01:23:02.700
There's something weird going on.

2969
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:04.590
It's not just the words coming out of your mouth,

2970
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:08.520
it's you about those words as they come out of your mouth and people recognizing

2971
01:23:08.521 --> 01:23:09.331
that you're in the moment,

2972
01:23:09.331 --> 01:23:10.170
which makes it funny.

2973
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.120
Those are two very real things.

2974
01:23:12.270 --> 01:23:16.080
So when I see someone like pretentious and someone just someone who's like

2975
01:23:16.081 --> 01:23:20.310
taking themselves way too fucking seriously or wants a lot of accolades and

2976
01:23:20.311 --> 01:23:22.290
respect to something that's basically just,

2977
01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:23.010
that's what you're,

2978
01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:23.731
that's what you do,

2979
01:23:23.731 --> 01:23:24.300
man.

2980
01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.350
You're really good at that.

2981
01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.330
This guy's really good at fixing people's eyes.

2982
01:23:27.450 --> 01:23:29.250
This guy's really good at driving cars.

2983
01:23:29.370 --> 01:23:30.450
You don't be an asshole.

2984
01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:31.441
It's really simple.

2985
01:23:31.441 --> 01:23:34.680
Don't take yourself too fucking seriously because you don't deserve any extra

2986
01:23:34.681 --> 01:23:35.550
appreciation.

2987
01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.290
You don't deserve any extra respect.

2988
01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.850
You don't deserve any extra attention.

2989
01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:41.520
You deserve exactly what the fuck you've already gotten,

2990
01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:44.220
and you should be super duper thankful for that.

2991
01:23:44.430 --> 01:23:46.620
And anytime you want more than what you're getting,

2992
01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:47.640
you're a cunt.

2993
01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:49.110
It's that simple.

2994
01:23:49.170 --> 01:23:50.640
If you demand respect,

2995
01:23:50.641 --> 01:23:51.000
you're a,

2996
01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.833
you're a cunt.

2997
01:23:51.900 --> 01:23:53.040
You're simply a cunt.

2998
01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.450
It's your problem.

2999
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.780
You're,

3000
01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.740
you're imbalanced.

3001
01:23:55.741 --> 01:23:57.090
You need to take a yoga class.

3002
01:23:57.210 --> 01:23:58.980
You need to go on a mushroom trip,

3003
01:23:59.100 --> 01:23:59.940
go to Perot,

3004
01:23:59.941 --> 01:24:01.230
take some Iowasca,

3005
01:24:01.260 --> 01:24:01.980
do something,

3006
01:24:01.980 --> 01:24:02.813
but stop.

3007
01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:06.660
It's 2000 and fucking 13 we have no time for you anymore.

3008
01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:08.520
I have no time this time.

3009
01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:09.630
There's so many.

3010
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:11.160
It's rats,

3011
01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.270
rats in a fucking sewer.

3012
01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.020
Goddammit.

3013
01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:13.440
What,

3014
01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.273
uh,

3015
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:15.660
when do you think,

3016
01:24:15.661 --> 01:24:16.260
uh,

3017
01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:17.910
but also cool people?

3018
01:24:18.130 --> 01:24:18.340
Oh,

3019
01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:18.931
don't get me wrong.

3020
01:24:18.931 --> 01:24:19.000
Yeah.

3021
01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:19.161
Yeah.

3022
01:24:19.161 --> 01:24:19.650
There's one,

3023
01:24:19.650 --> 01:24:20.483
there's populations,

3024
01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:21.323
massive.

3025
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:21.990
I mean,

3026
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.030
Joey Diaz,

3027
01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:25.320
so Ari should fear that my friends that I met,

3028
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:26.430
I met all here.

3029
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:27.780
So it's not all kinds.

3030
01:24:27.781 --> 01:24:29.160
There's some awesome people here.

3031
01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.330
When do you think there's

3032
01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:31.220
<v 3>time?</v>

3033
01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:34.610
Anytime soon when the content creators,

3034
01:24:34.611 --> 01:24:36.380
whether that's the comics,

3035
01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:37.700
uh,

3036
01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:38.481
documentarians,

3037
01:24:38.481 --> 01:24:39.320
whatever it might be,

3038
01:24:39.321 --> 01:24:39.740
aren't,

3039
01:24:39.740 --> 01:24:43.880
are going to be able to create what they want to create outside of the big

3040
01:24:43.881 --> 01:24:44.990
agencies and whatnot.

3041
01:24:44.991 --> 01:24:45.440
I mean,

3042
01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:45.760
is,

3043
01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.593
is that

3044
01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:47.840
<v 6>okay</v>

3045
01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.550
<v 3>infrastructure really necessary?</v>

3046
01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:52.770
How much longer is that going to be necessary when people and brands start

3047
01:24:52.771 --> 01:24:54.200
coming to the podcast?

3048
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:56.330
When brands start coming to the bloggers,

3049
01:24:56.331 --> 01:24:57.470
the writers directly,

3050
01:24:57.471 --> 01:24:58.880
so they have funding of some type,

3051
01:24:58.881 --> 01:24:59.714
like,

3052
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:01.190
<v 6>yeah,</v>

3053
01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:01.640
<v 3>what's,</v>

3054
01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:02.540
what's to,

3055
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:03.170
what are the,

3056
01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:05.090
what is the benefit of operating within like the big,

3057
01:25:05.091 --> 01:25:05.781
big agencies,

3058
01:25:05.781 --> 01:25:06.591
the managers do this,

3059
01:25:06.591 --> 01:25:07.640
that and the other thing to produce,

3060
01:25:07.641 --> 01:25:09.060
let's say 30 minute,

3061
01:25:09.090 --> 01:25:10.350
30 minute TV show right now.

3062
01:25:10.650 --> 01:25:10.831
<v 0>Well,</v>

3063
01:25:10.831 --> 01:25:14.790
I think the real benefit is going to be with people who are excellent at what

3064
01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:15.301
they do.

3065
01:25:15.301 --> 01:25:17.580
Instead of it being some sort of a,

3066
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:23.530
instead of it being where the situation where it was before the Internet was,

3067
01:25:24.471 --> 01:25:27.590
they controlled all of the entertainment.

3068
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:32.720
It was essential that you be with a studio to get a television show on.

3069
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:33.590
Cause that's,

3070
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:34.910
you can't make your own network.

3071
01:25:34.911 --> 01:25:36.200
You can just put your own network on.

3072
01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:38.540
Like when Fox came along it was shocking.

3073
01:25:38.541 --> 01:25:40.850
Like there's a new network,

3074
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:42.110
what is this?

3075
01:25:42.230 --> 01:25:43.820
And they had a good show married with children.

3076
01:25:43.821 --> 01:25:44.361
Holy Shit.

3077
01:25:44.361 --> 01:25:45.194
And the Simpsons,

3078
01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.640
what the fuck is going on?

3079
01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.000
We have a new play.

3080
01:25:48.001 --> 01:25:53.001
Or in this game it was one new player in the Goddamn history of television,

3081
01:25:53.151 --> 01:25:53.631
ABC,

3082
01:25:53.631 --> 01:25:54.291
CBS,

3083
01:25:54.291 --> 01:25:54.801
NBC,

3084
01:25:54.801 --> 01:25:56.360
which was going on forever.

3085
01:25:56.361 --> 01:25:56.571
They,

3086
01:25:56.571 --> 01:25:57.470
it was a dictatorship.

3087
01:25:57.490 --> 01:25:57.840
They,

3088
01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:59.390
they owned the output.

3089
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:02.330
Now everything is on the Internet.

3090
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:04.190
So in sense when it comes

3091
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.390
<v 1>to low budget things,</v>

3092
01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:07.070
when it comes to your,

3093
01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:07.301
uh,

3094
01:26:07.301 --> 01:26:10.400
ability to transmit like a sitcom sort of a thing,

3095
01:26:10.490 --> 01:26:12.290
especially like a single camera one,

3096
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:12.951
God,

3097
01:26:12.951 --> 01:26:14.060
you can do that with your iPhone.

3098
01:26:14.220 --> 01:26:14.631
I mean,

3099
01:26:14.631 --> 01:26:17.690
we can make a single camera sitcom with no audience for the God damn iPhone.

3100
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:20.180
And it would be as long as it would cost our time,

3101
01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:21.620
but we'd have to write the scripts out.

3102
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:23.990
But what's lighting do you really need?

3103
01:26:23.991 --> 01:26:25.430
I know what you look like if the point they can't,

3104
01:26:25.431 --> 01:26:25.851
if it's funny,

3105
01:26:25.851 --> 01:26:26.451
I'm gonna Laugh.

3106
01:26:26.451 --> 01:26:27.284
It's really

3107
01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:28.920
hilarious.

3108
01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:29.840
Even need to do that.

3109
01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:30.883
You know,

3110
01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:34.850
how much really do you need to spend to make something good?

3111
01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:34.961
Well,

3112
01:26:34.961 --> 01:26:36.020
it just means to be good.

3113
01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:36.430
Yeah.

3114
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.890
Um,

3115
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:40.190
but when it comes to like the hobbit where you're still gonna need,

3116
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:40.880
right.

3117
01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:44.240
A team of bad motherfuckers who've been doing this forever when it comes to,

3118
01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:47.450
especially I think when it comes to special effects and creative effects and

3119
01:26:47.451 --> 01:26:48.081
things like that,

3120
01:26:48.081 --> 01:26:49.400
like Cgi,

3121
01:26:49.401 --> 01:26:50.840
like the guys who make like,

3122
01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:51.620
you know,

3123
01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:52.281
alien,

3124
01:26:52.281 --> 01:26:53.180
like there's a,

3125
01:26:53.210 --> 01:26:54.560
the guy who is making the,

3126
01:26:54.561 --> 01:26:55.281
I forgot his name,

3127
01:26:55.281 --> 01:26:56.270
I really apologize.

3128
01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:59.510
He made me a bust of a aliens vs Predator.

3129
01:26:59.511 --> 01:27:01.960
Like one of the aliens and a,

3130
01:27:01.980 --> 01:27:02.301
I'm going to,

3131
01:27:02.301 --> 01:27:03.081
I'm going to bring it in here.

3132
01:27:03.081 --> 01:27:04.220
It's fucking sick.

3133
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:05.150
It's amazing,

3134
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:05.750
isn't it sick?

3135
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:06.020
Yeah,

3136
01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:06.710
it looks awesome.

3137
01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:07.543
It's so dope.

3138
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:07.971
Yeah.

3139
01:27:07.971 --> 01:27:08.840
I love that shit.

3140
01:27:08.841 --> 01:27:09.640
And um,

3141
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:09.890
uh,

3142
01:27:09.890 --> 01:27:11.540
Pat Mcgee is making a,

3143
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:11.691
a,

3144
01:27:11.691 --> 01:27:13.160
a giant American Werewolf.

3145
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:16.850
He's a making a full size American Werewolf in the studio.

3146
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.871
It's so sick.

3147
01:27:17.871 --> 01:27:19.370
It's got yak hair covering.

3148
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.940
Have you,

3149
01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:20.773
I'll show it to you.

3150
01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.770
You're going to shit your pants.

3151
01:27:21.771 --> 01:27:23.030
It's the most beautiful thing ever.

3152
01:27:23.031 --> 01:27:24.830
Especially it's very fucking movie.

3153
01:27:25.130 --> 01:27:25.431
Fuck.

3154
01:27:25.431 --> 01:27:25.641
Yeah.

3155
01:27:25.641 --> 01:27:26.480
It was a scary movie.

3156
01:27:26.630 --> 01:27:27.620
It was an amazing movie.

3157
01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.110
But I read that's never going to go out of style.

3158
01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:31.350
You're going to need those guys.

3159
01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.440
You're going to need special effects people.

3160
01:27:33.530 --> 01:27:35.630
And like a guy like Albert Chino or,

3161
01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:36.041
I mean,

3162
01:27:36.041 --> 01:27:36.800
I just use him.

3163
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:37.850
I should use a,

3164
01:27:37.910 --> 01:27:38.570
okay.

3165
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:39.261
A guy like,

3166
01:27:39.261 --> 01:27:39.940
um,

3167
01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:40.370
uh,

3168
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:41.750
Leonardo Dicaprio.

3169
01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:42.060
Yeah.

3170
01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:42.390
The,

3171
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:46.370
the performance that he put in in that Django movie.

3172
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:48.110
He's a bad motherfucker.

3173
01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:48.550
All right.

3174
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:49.520
You need that guy.

3175
01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.413
You got to find,

3176
01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:50.901
you know,

3177
01:27:50.901 --> 01:27:51.980
you need guys like that.

3178
01:27:51.981 --> 01:27:52.250
There's,

3179
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:53.960
there's certain people that obviously they're,

3180
01:27:53.961 --> 01:27:55.490
they're super skilled at that,

3181
01:27:55.530 --> 01:27:56.480
that art form,

3182
01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:57.630
you know,

3183
01:27:57.630 --> 01:27:57.960
that was,

3184
01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.510
that was also a lot of people.

3185
01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:00.373
Uh,

3186
01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:02.840
I've become fascinated by Quentin Tarantino.

3187
01:28:02.841 --> 01:28:03.621
I don't know that guy at all,

3188
01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:07.100
but I've been really fascinated by his also creative process.

3189
01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:09.530
I've been on this kind of trip with the creative process stuff recently.

3190
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:13.550
You want to get really fascinated listening to him talk on different radio

3191
01:28:13.551 --> 01:28:14.031
stations.

3192
01:28:14.031 --> 01:28:15.500
He's a completely different human being.

3193
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:17.000
There's something going on with that guy.

3194
01:28:17.001 --> 01:28:17.291
He's,

3195
01:28:17.291 --> 01:28:21.050
he just like a chameleon chameleon or he's crazy.

3196
01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:23.840
There's something up when he's talking to black people,

3197
01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:24.674
he talks about,

3198
01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.040
he's so funny.

3199
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.903
It's awesome.

3200
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:28.330
I called Brian up there,

3201
01:28:28.331 --> 01:28:28.870
I call you up.

3202
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:29.870
I left her a text message.

3203
01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:32.870
Whatever you tweeted it or yeah,

3204
01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.090
cause I was listening to it in the car and I was like,

3205
01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:35.871
when I texted you,

3206
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:37.510
I think like do hilarious.

3207
01:28:37.511 --> 01:28:39.920
It's the most preposterous thing you've ever seen in your life.

3208
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.840
Here's just American Werewolf.

3209
01:28:41.890 --> 01:28:42.191
Whoa,

3210
01:28:42.191 --> 01:28:42.860
look at that.

3211
01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:44.270
Isn't that the sickest thing I've ever done?

3212
01:28:44.350 --> 01:28:44.910
Awesome.

3213
01:28:44.910 --> 01:28:46.420
That's super cool.

3214
01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:47.870
Um,

3215
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:48.441
but he,

3216
01:28:48.441 --> 01:28:48.561
uh,

3217
01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:50.030
so he's talking to Howard Stern.

3218
01:28:50.031 --> 01:28:50.960
He sounds like a gay guy.

3219
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:51.381
He's like,

3220
01:28:51.381 --> 01:28:51.950
he's,

3221
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:53.480
he's being a feminist to Alpha,

3222
01:28:53.481 --> 01:28:54.860
to the alpha of Stern.

3223
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:57.020
And then when he goes on to the Anthony Show,

3224
01:28:57.050 --> 01:28:58.070
then he's one of the guys.

3225
01:28:58.071 --> 01:28:58.760
He's more,

3226
01:28:58.760 --> 01:28:59.511
he's louder,

3227
01:28:59.511 --> 01:29:00.680
he's more heterosexual.

3228
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:02.020
Then when he's

3229
01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:04.030
<v 0>on the Jamie Foxx show,</v>

3230
01:29:04.090 --> 01:29:05.560
Jamie Foxx and him start talking.

3231
01:29:05.561 --> 01:29:06.520
He goes full black.

3232
01:29:07.650 --> 01:29:09.400
He's talking about Laurence Fishburne.

3233
01:29:09.401 --> 01:29:09.641
He's like,

3234
01:29:09.641 --> 01:29:09.851
fish,

3235
01:29:09.851 --> 01:29:10.750
got his fish guide,

3236
01:29:10.751 --> 01:29:11.620
his fish got paid.

3237
01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:13.540
The motherfucker got his,

3238
01:29:13.630 --> 01:29:15.280
like literally says the motherfucker got his,

3239
01:29:15.281 --> 01:29:17.470
like he's completely black.

3240
01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:17.980
Wow.

3241
01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:19.180
It's fascinating.

3242
01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:19.601
And then,

3243
01:29:19.601 --> 01:29:21.760
you know what someone said to me when I tweeted that,

3244
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.540
um,

3245
01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.051
they go,

3246
01:29:23.051 --> 01:29:23.500
how does,

3247
01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.280
how does a black,

3248
01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:26.050
how does a person's sound black?

3249
01:29:26.290 --> 01:29:27.310
I knew that was kind to be,

3250
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.761
and I'm like,

3251
01:29:27.761 --> 01:29:29.380
how the fuck do you think it does?

3252
01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:30.910
We playing games here?

3253
01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:34.030
Are you telling me that if someone saw talk like this on TV,

3254
01:29:34.150 --> 01:29:34.751
you wouldn't say,

3255
01:29:34.751 --> 01:29:35.680
why are you talking black?

3256
01:29:35.980 --> 01:29:36.320
Yeah.

3257
01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.140
I'm not saying that every black person talks like that,

3258
01:29:38.141 --> 01:29:40.510
but to pretend that some black people don't talk like that,

3259
01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:41.830
it's crazy.

3260
01:29:42.010 --> 01:29:45.850
But there's that fucking little racism button that everybody loves their finger

3261
01:29:45.851 --> 01:29:46.240
on.

3262
01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:46.571
Oh,

3263
01:29:46.571 --> 01:29:47.404
you bet.

3264
01:29:47.530 --> 01:29:49.100
<v 7>Something racist.</v>

3265
01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:49.401
Oh,

3266
01:29:49.401 --> 01:29:50.770
press this little button.

3267
01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.340
I'm very sensitive.

3268
01:29:52.510 --> 01:29:54.280
<v 0>What did you mean by talking black?</v>

3269
01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.293
Oh Gee,

3270
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:57.130
what the fuck do you think I meant?

3271
01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.210
Why are you responding?

3272
01:29:58.211 --> 01:29:59.410
You hoping I'm racist?

3273
01:29:59.411 --> 01:29:59.690
What do you,

3274
01:29:59.690 --> 01:30:00.161
are you looking,

3275
01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:01.480
are you searching for something?

3276
01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:06.160
The idea that you're pretending that there's not a very distinct vernacular to

3277
01:30:06.161 --> 01:30:09.550
the African American community negates the whole idea of ebonics,

3278
01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:11.350
which is actually discussed about,

3279
01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:14.350
they were teaching you bond next to people to try to get educators to understand

3280
01:30:14.351 --> 01:30:15.520
what the fuck black people were saying.

3281
01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:16.713
Okay.

3282
01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:18.490
You don't need to know any more than that.

3283
01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:19.751
What does ebonics?

3284
01:30:19.751 --> 01:30:20.441
It's ebony.

3285
01:30:20.441 --> 01:30:20.831
Okay.

3286
01:30:20.831 --> 01:30:21.520
It's black,

3287
01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.530
goddammit ebonics.

3288
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:24.550
What's the beginning?

3289
01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.720
The beginning of it is black.

3290
01:30:25.721 --> 01:30:26.680
It's black talk

3291
01:30:28.660 --> 01:30:29.321
and apparently,

3292
01:30:29.321 --> 01:30:30.154
well I guess

3293
01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:33.040
he's got a black belt in ebonics.

3294
01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:34.100
He went right in.

3295
01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.950
And do you have any audio of it?

3296
01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:37.750
I thought we could probably play it.

3297
01:30:37.751 --> 01:30:37.901
I mean,

3298
01:30:37.901 --> 01:30:40.870
we're a serious look and this is not making fun of Quentin Tarantino.

3299
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:42.910
I think it's a part of his genius.

3300
01:30:43.450 --> 01:30:46.230
I mean it absolutely is making fun of Quentin Tarantino Gamete.

3301
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:47.020
Don't get me wrong,

3302
01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:47.890
but I love him.

3303
01:30:48.070 --> 01:30:49.300
I think he's fucking awesome.

3304
01:30:49.301 --> 01:30:51.520
He's my favorite director by far.

3305
01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:56.770
If you had to look at like the movies that I really enjoyed over the past few

3306
01:30:56.770 --> 01:30:56.771
years,

3307
01:30:56.771 --> 01:31:01.510
whether it's killed bill or pulp fiction or I really loved to Django and or

3308
01:31:01.511 --> 01:31:02.410
Jango whatever.

3309
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:03.220
And uh,

3310
01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:03.611
I,

3311
01:31:03.611 --> 01:31:03.910
uh,

3312
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:07.060
I loved 'em inglorious bastards to these movies are fun.

3313
01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:07.680
They're there,

3314
01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.700
they're wild or great experiences,

3315
01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.560
but him as a person,

3316
01:31:11.561 --> 01:31:13.870
part of being I think a genius in anything.

3317
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:15.460
And I definitely think he's a genius.

3318
01:31:15.710 --> 01:31:16.960
As you gotta be a weird,

3319
01:31:17.050 --> 01:31:17.883
you gotta be,

3320
01:31:17.980 --> 01:31:20.080
you gotta be all over the last year a little off.

3321
01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:24.700
And I think a guy who's so creative when it comes to like dialogue,

3322
01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:29.080
when a guy who's like so creative about personalities and his films and how he

3323
01:31:29.081 --> 01:31:29.920
sets them up,

3324
01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:31.091
I think,

3325
01:31:31.091 --> 01:31:31.331
you know,

3326
01:31:31.331 --> 01:31:34.450
he's like constantly like being all these different people,

3327
01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:34.751
you know,

3328
01:31:34.751 --> 01:31:35.051
he's like,

3329
01:31:35.051 --> 01:31:38.020
I think you would have to be to get dialogue that believable.

3330
01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:38.800
You know what I mean?

3331
01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.060
Yeah.

3332
01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:42.010
You almost have to be able to shape shift.

3333
01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:42.580
Yeah.

3334
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:43.870
And maybe just can't turn it off.

3335
01:31:44.290 --> 01:31:45.640
Maybe just never thought about turning it on.

3336
01:31:45.641 --> 01:31:46.474
It's just how it is.

3337
01:31:46.690 --> 01:31:49.330
But the one I was going to make when you brought up the Leonardo Dicaprio,

3338
01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:53.920
I was going to say that the entire piece in that movie on phrenology,

3339
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:55.990
so the bumps on the skull and everything else,

3340
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:58.360
Leonardo Dicaprio brought that into the script.

3341
01:31:58.570 --> 01:31:59.403
I was his idea.

3342
01:32:00.390 --> 01:32:01.210
<v 1>Uh,</v>

3343
01:32:01.210 --> 01:32:01.900
and so I was,

3344
01:32:01.900 --> 01:32:02.650
I just got me,

3345
01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:03.850
got me to thinking about

3346
01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:06.270
anyway,

3347
01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:06.451
the,

3348
01:32:06.451 --> 01:32:06.711
the,

3349
01:32:06.711 --> 01:32:10.270
the writing process and how I admire the fact,

3350
01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:14.740
cause I could see how I would get very protective of my fiefdom if I were a

3351
01:32:14.741 --> 01:32:17.320
writer of say a script fiefdom.

3352
01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.130
Yeah.

3353
01:32:18.130 --> 01:32:19.510
If Ife correct.

3354
01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.530
Never used that word.

3355
01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:21.910
I don't even know what it means.

3356
01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:23.433
What does that mean?

3357
01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:24.700
If you're a fief Lord,

3358
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:28.383
you have a,

3359
01:32:28.730 --> 01:32:29.920
in I guess what the Middle Ages,

3360
01:32:29.921 --> 01:32:32.770
you'd have fiefdom and you'd have the serfs and then you'd have the clerics have

3361
01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:35.770
the fucking high priests and then you'd have the Lord of the manor or the king

3362
01:32:35.771 --> 01:32:36.604
or whatever.

3363
01:32:36.850 --> 01:32:38.260
And so that would be a little,

3364
01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:39.910
when people say a fiefdom,

3365
01:32:39.911 --> 01:32:43.270
it's like a territory that they defend typically if you're using it like a

3366
01:32:43.271 --> 01:32:44.620
corporate environment.

3367
01:32:44.621 --> 01:32:44.771
Right.

3368
01:32:44.771 --> 01:32:47.440
So this person has their fucking silo and they're like,

3369
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:48.490
Hey Jack,

3370
01:32:48.970 --> 01:32:49.630
I know you want it.

3371
01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:50.291
You mean well,

3372
01:32:50.291 --> 01:32:54.610
but like we don't want your input here cause I want to protect my job by not

3373
01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:58.750
letting you fuck with this portion of the company that I control or whatever.

3374
01:32:59.230 --> 01:32:59.441
So,

3375
01:32:59.441 --> 01:33:01.030
but I could see getting as a writer,

3376
01:33:01.031 --> 01:33:02.530
I'm very meticulous and I,

3377
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:05.530
I do not like people fucking with my writing and less and less,

3378
01:33:05.531 --> 01:33:07.000
they're better at writing than I am.

3379
01:33:07.001 --> 01:33:08.830
Like as some of my friends like Neil Strauss,

3380
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:09.610
right.

3381
01:33:09.610 --> 01:33:10.391
Incredible writer.

3382
01:33:10.391 --> 01:33:11.224
I'll have him,

3383
01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:13.180
I will gladly let him tell me what you,

3384
01:33:13.220 --> 01:33:14.560
what of my stuff sucks.

3385
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:15.521
But uh,

3386
01:33:15.521 --> 01:33:20.521
the fact that like Tarantino actively engages his actors in altering the script,

3387
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:21.580
I just think is,

3388
01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:22.990
is pretty cool,

3389
01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:23.500
eh,

3390
01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:24.640
with the results that you guys,

3391
01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:25.691
yeah,

3392
01:33:25.691 --> 01:33:27.160
there's not a lot of people that do that.

3393
01:33:27.210 --> 01:33:31.170
And that was the style of a Paul Simms who was the producer of news radio for a

3394
01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:31.510
second.

3395
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.841
I was in,

3396
01:33:31.841 --> 01:33:32.800
it was really fascinating.

3397
01:33:32.801 --> 01:33:33.340
Like,

3398
01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:33.730
uh,

3399
01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:37.270
Dave Foley essentially like rewrote like half of that show.

3400
01:33:37.330 --> 01:33:39.190
Like in the process of rehearsal.

3401
01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:40.960
Some people are willing to do that,

3402
01:33:41.110 --> 01:33:42.020
but you know,

3403
01:33:42.100 --> 01:33:45.640
the most important thing is getting it out there the best way possible.

3404
01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.870
And some people recognize that the best way to do that is to allow for some

3405
01:33:49.871 --> 01:33:50.920
fuckery or some,

3406
01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:52.480
I shouldn't say fuckery manipulation,

3407
01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.081
some,

3408
01:33:53.081 --> 01:33:55.540
some flexibility allowed fuckery.

3409
01:33:55.541 --> 01:33:56.374
I've never heard that.

3410
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:57.370
He's really bullshit though.

3411
01:33:57.371 --> 01:33:58.330
So it's not bullshit.

3412
01:33:58.331 --> 01:33:59.164
It's the wrong word.

3413
01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.033
You never heard fuckery?

3414
01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:00.570
I've never,

3415
01:34:00.570 --> 01:34:01.270
no dude.

3416
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.920
There's some,

3417
01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.020
one of the best things to say if you,

3418
01:34:04.080 --> 01:34:04.301
you know,

3419
01:34:04.301 --> 01:34:09.301
not really sure if this is legit is I believe perhaps some fuckery is a foot

3420
01:34:11.130 --> 01:34:12.910
fucking some fuckery in the fiefdom.

3421
01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:13.931
I started talking,

3422
01:34:13.931 --> 01:34:18.430
I started using the word fuckery to describe a fake martial arts.

3423
01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:21.760
That's where first I first entered into my way of speaking.

3424
01:34:21.940 --> 01:34:24.100
Cause there's a lot of always just strikes.

3425
01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:24.670
It's the word.

3426
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:29.470
There's the word is correct when it comes to like shit martial arts because it

3427
01:34:29.471 --> 01:34:30.131
is fuckery.

3428
01:34:30.131 --> 01:34:31.570
It's just like cultish stuff.

3429
01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.000
It's like they're pretending to have magic powers.

3430
01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:34.781
You know,

3431
01:34:34.781 --> 01:34:34.980
it's,

3432
01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:36.400
fuckery is the right word for that.

3433
01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:37.570
But there's some,

3434
01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:38.110
you know,

3435
01:34:38.110 --> 01:34:40.120
there's some really wacky videos out there.

3436
01:34:40.121 --> 01:34:42.970
If you were seeing like kind of two experts who just touch people and they go

3437
01:34:42.971 --> 01:34:44.590
flying across the room is some of them.

3438
01:34:44.591 --> 01:34:45.700
There was this black dude who,

3439
01:34:45.701 --> 01:34:46.030
uh,

3440
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.990
had these students,

3441
01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:48.310
it was really amazing.

3442
01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:49.030
Um,

3443
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:53.080
I became completely obsessed with Black Kung Fu guys for awhile because there

3444
01:34:53.081 --> 01:34:56.440
was a lot of them that were like really into like the mystical aspect of,

3445
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:58.010
and black guys are the only ones who are

3446
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.880
<v 0>allowed to use the word,</v>

3447
01:34:58.881 --> 01:34:59.630
the arts,

3448
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:00.463
that expression.

3449
01:35:00.650 --> 01:35:00.891
You know,

3450
01:35:00.891 --> 01:35:03.440
I studied the arts for a long time,

3451
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:03.860
you know,

3452
01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:05.480
deep involved in the arts.

3453
01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.890
But this one dude,

3454
01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:08.540
he had a whole,

3455
01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:12.800
a school full of people that believed that he had super powers.

3456
01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.430
And so he would do his class and we'd go up to him,

3457
01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:20.540
just throw his hand in front of them and they would go flying and he would do

3458
01:35:20.541 --> 01:35:23.060
this to people and they would come at him like they would charge for,

3459
01:35:23.061 --> 01:35:24.410
like they were going to attack and he would just go,

3460
01:35:24.650 --> 01:35:25.340
Ooh.

3461
01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:27.360
And they would flip and fall to the ground.

3462
01:35:27.361 --> 01:35:28.430
And flop like fish.

3463
01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:30.230
It was hilarious.

3464
01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:35.320
It was the craziest thing ever because these people willingly went with his

3465
01:35:35.541 --> 01:35:37.700
direction and they did it in a,

3466
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:40.310
they knew the camera was there and they said,

3467
01:35:40.311 --> 01:35:40.791
you know what,

3468
01:35:40.791 --> 01:35:41.900
I'm just going to play along.

3469
01:35:42.140 --> 01:35:44.360
And they all agreed that this guy has power.

3470
01:35:44.361 --> 01:35:45.194
So when that guy goes,

3471
01:35:45.350 --> 01:35:46.011
ah,

3472
01:35:46.011 --> 01:35:49.640
they're pretending they're playing and the guy would fall and flop around on the

3473
01:35:49.641 --> 01:35:50.420
ground.

3474
01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:53.510
And there's a very famous video of one guy who was one of these guys.

3475
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:58.760
It was a Chinese gentleman who someone convinced him to have an MMA fight.

3476
01:35:59.270 --> 01:36:01.210
So he had these demonstrations do,

3477
01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.170
doing when these guys ran at him,

3478
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:06.230
pull that up because that's more and more interesting than anything.

3479
01:36:06.380 --> 01:36:06.921
Pull that up.

3480
01:36:06.921 --> 01:36:07.790
And what we'll find this,

3481
01:36:08.140 --> 01:36:08.540
um,

3482
01:36:08.540 --> 01:36:13.490
Chinese Kung Fu guy gets ass kicked by MMA guy.

3483
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:15.020
That's probably the,

3484
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:19.220
this guy beat the fucking shit out of this poor old dude.

3485
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:22.640
This poor old guy really thought that he could do that.

3486
01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:25.550
And he had these students need the demonstration before,

3487
01:36:25.551 --> 01:36:28.550
but they would run out of him and he would do that to the top of their head.

3488
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:30.140
They would fall to the ground and conscious.

3489
01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:30.561
I mean,

3490
01:36:30.561 --> 01:36:33.200
it was really wild to watch.

3491
01:36:33.230 --> 01:36:34.063
Hilarious.

3492
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:38.300
And this guy went and he was probably in his fifties or sixties minivan and he

3493
01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:42.500
went in as a Kung Fu master and this guy just beat him down,

3494
01:36:42.710 --> 01:36:44.060
just kicked his legs,

3495
01:36:44.061 --> 01:36:44.960
punched him in the face,

3496
01:36:44.961 --> 01:36:45.710
elbow them,

3497
01:36:45.710 --> 01:36:46.730
just crushed him,

3498
01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:47.541
took him down,

3499
01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:48.230
smashed him.

3500
01:36:48.230 --> 01:36:53.030
It was just horrific to watch because you're watching not just a guy get beat

3501
01:36:53.031 --> 01:36:53.330
up,

3502
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:54.110
which is always,

3503
01:36:54.110 --> 01:36:55.400
I don't like mismatches,

3504
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:56.010
you know,

3505
01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:59.630
it drives me crazy when I see someone who shouldn't be there,

3506
01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:03.080
who's there because someone lied to them about their proficiency level.

3507
01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:06.110
So that aspect of it I do not like at all.

3508
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:10.370
But it's fascinating to watch a guy's illusions get shattered in the most

3509
01:37:10.371 --> 01:37:11.720
realistic way possible.

3510
01:37:12.110 --> 01:37:14.040
He actually had some belief,

3511
01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:14.211
no,

3512
01:37:14.211 --> 01:37:15.080
this is a different one.

3513
01:37:15.410 --> 01:37:16.970
This is another Kung Fu one though.

3514
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:18.350
But that's a dude.

3515
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:20.180
I forget his name.

3516
01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:20.490
He's,

3517
01:37:20.490 --> 01:37:22.400
he was a fucking huge guy.

3518
01:37:22.401 --> 01:37:23.930
Who's an MMA.

3519
01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:24.471
That's it.

3520
01:37:24.471 --> 01:37:25.430
That's the one right there.

3521
01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:28.310
Key I master versus MMA or no,

3522
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:30.440
this is a horrific scene,

3523
01:37:30.441 --> 01:37:31.040
man.

3524
01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.180
This is really fucked up.

3525
01:37:32.181 --> 01:37:33.530
Go full screen up on this bitch.

3526
01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:34.530
Look at this guy.

3527
01:37:34.530 --> 01:37:35.001
So you look,

3528
01:37:35.001 --> 01:37:37.520
this is him with his students where they come at him.

3529
01:37:37.570 --> 01:37:38.403
Watch what he does.

3530
01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:39.373
Look at this.

3531
01:37:39.650 --> 01:37:39.981
Look at that.

3532
01:37:39.981 --> 01:37:40.820
They just fall to the ground.

3533
01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:41.240
This is,

3534
01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.170
this is insane.

3535
01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:45.530
He's like throwing hands in front of their face and they willingly follow the

3536
01:37:45.531 --> 01:37:45.860
ground.

3537
01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:48.230
They're all wearing black belts to and look,

3538
01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.690
he wagers $5,000 apparently that he,

3539
01:37:51.691 --> 01:37:52.280
he'd look at this,

3540
01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.950
he's doing these things with his hands and they're like flipping around.

3541
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:55.890
This is real,

3542
01:37:55.891 --> 01:37:56.220
man.

3543
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:58.380
<v 8>This is not like a play someone's putting on.</v>

3544
01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:00.091
I mean,

3545
01:38:00.091 --> 01:38:00.571
look at this.

3546
01:38:00.571 --> 01:38:01.710
He's like throwing his hands.

3547
01:38:01.711 --> 01:38:01.981
In the end,

3548
01:38:01.981 --> 01:38:06.981
the guys whipping himself back and forth like it's like for whatever reason,

3549
01:38:07.071 --> 01:38:07.600
we'll look at that.

3550
01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:08.790
That's a pancreas jacket.

3551
01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:09.420
That guys where,

3552
01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:10.253
yes.

3553
01:38:10.930 --> 01:38:11.170
Hi.

3554
01:38:11.170 --> 01:38:12.330
Back in the day,

3555
01:38:12.331 --> 01:38:15.810
I used to watch Wayne Shamrock as they called them back then.

3556
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:16.321
Ken Wayne.

3557
01:38:16.321 --> 01:38:16.680
Shamrock.

3558
01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:18.180
I saw the very first,

3559
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:20.110
very first Pancras fight.

3560
01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.350
He's going to fight this guy who,

3561
01:38:22.370 --> 01:38:22.920
uh,

3562
01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:24.480
he's wearing a like a,

3563
01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:24.750
uh,

3564
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:28.350
judogi on this top and the waste is a,

3565
01:38:28.351 --> 01:38:31.560
he's gets just got fight shorts on and he's going to beat the fuck out of this

3566
01:38:31.561 --> 01:38:32.970
old man and this guy is old.

3567
01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:35.790
<v 9>It's hard to see because it's this low resolution.</v>

3568
01:38:36.270 --> 01:38:39.210
I've seen a higher resolution video of it and it's uh,

3569
01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.210
it's crazy that someone talked this old man

3570
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:44.150
<v 8>and to believe that he can actually fight.</v>

3571
01:38:44.151 --> 01:38:49.151
He has a red masters belt on and this Black Kung Fu outfit and um,

3572
01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:51.710
see this old crazy man.

3573
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:53.840
You think maybe like maybe he's losing his mind.

3574
01:38:54.020 --> 01:38:54.890
I don't know man.

3575
01:38:54.891 --> 01:38:58.100
I mean I think some of them they get so just bought into the illusion.

3576
01:38:58.130 --> 01:38:58.311
Yeah.

3577
01:38:58.311 --> 01:39:02.390
They get so much love from their students and their students are so obedient

3578
01:39:02.480 --> 01:39:04.400
that they really start believing in their masters.

3579
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:05.263
I think it's,

3580
01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:08.030
it becomes sort of a self fulfilling illusion.

3581
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:10.423
Nervous.

3582
01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:12.230
Well everybody's nervous before a fight.

3583
01:39:12.231 --> 01:39:13.250
You can't avoid that.

3584
01:39:13.251 --> 01:39:14.960
Your body is going to know you're about to go to war.

3585
01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.730
But I think with this little white beard,

3586
01:39:16.731 --> 01:39:19.940
he actually believes he can fight and the other guy shakes his hand and bows and

3587
01:39:19.941 --> 01:39:21.860
now the beating will commence.

3588
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:24.610
They explain what's legal and what's not legal.

3589
01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:25.431
The guy says yes,

3590
01:39:25.431 --> 01:39:26.450
they bow to each other,

3591
01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.780
they stand back and they're going to start the time and this whole,

3592
01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:31.850
the guy's going to get the fuck beat out of him.

3593
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:32.390
Wow.

3594
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:35.810
And he really believes that he's going to be able to do this stuff and it's

3595
01:39:35.811 --> 01:39:39.520
fascinating watching them try to like throw his hands through the air and use

3596
01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:40.420
this cheat.

3597
01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:41.873
This

3598
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:46.070
throws his hands up in the air and the guy like measure them,

3599
01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.031
you know,

3600
01:39:47.031 --> 01:39:47.390
like a,

3601
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:49.790
like a fucking mountain line about to eat a deer.

3602
01:39:49.791 --> 01:39:50.630
He was posturing.

3603
01:39:51.970 --> 01:39:53.390
So you just leg kicked him,

3604
01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:55.970
punched him in the face.

3605
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.320
Now the guy's holding his face.

3606
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.840
It was a,

3607
01:39:58.840 --> 01:39:59.673
all right dude.

3608
01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:00.280
He's like,

3609
01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:01.100
I'm okay.

3610
01:40:01.100 --> 01:40:03.230
Bruce Lee movies just holding his mouth right here.

3611
01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.153
Yeah.

3612
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.791
He's like,

3613
01:40:04.791 --> 01:40:05.061
come on.

3614
01:40:05.061 --> 01:40:05.690
Are we fighting?

3615
01:40:05.690 --> 01:40:06.300
What's going on?

3616
01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:06.650
He's like,

3617
01:40:06.650 --> 01:40:07.850
keeps checking his mouth.

3618
01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:08.090
Like,

3619
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.520
oh my God,

3620
01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:09.131
someone hit me.

3621
01:40:09.131 --> 01:40:10.040
How is this possible?

3622
01:40:10.770 --> 01:40:11.350
So,

3623
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.931
so they said,

3624
01:40:11.931 --> 01:40:12.621
come on fight again,

3625
01:40:12.621 --> 01:40:13.050
dude.

3626
01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:14.120
Can't just hold your mouth.

3627
01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:16.730
So now the guy realizes this old man's done to,

3628
01:40:16.731 --> 01:40:20.600
he's going to just start beating the fuck out of him and the guys still trying

3629
01:40:20.601 --> 01:40:22.780
to do Kung Fu and now he's just hammering him with punches,

3630
01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:23.320
holes,

3631
01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:23.800
<v 9>jacket,</v>

3632
01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:24.633
head kick,

3633
01:40:24.700 --> 01:40:25.533
boom.

3634
01:40:25.810 --> 01:40:26.643
And that's it.

3635
01:40:27.850 --> 01:40:28.360
That's it.

3636
01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:29.080
Stop.

3637
01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:29.351
Stop,

3638
01:40:29.351 --> 01:40:29.770
please.

3639
01:40:29.770 --> 01:40:31.990
So the old man actually really

3640
01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:35.100
<v 8>thought that he was going to be able to do this crazy kung fu stuff.</v>

3641
01:40:35.101 --> 01:40:36.270
That was his attack.

3642
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:37.340
<v 3>That's the power.</v>

3643
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:39.680
The power of the mind is so incredible.

3644
01:40:39.681 --> 01:40:40.514
I mean like when you,

3645
01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:44.660
I don't if you've ever seen a real hypnosis demonstrations,

3646
01:40:44.661 --> 01:40:47.990
like the physiological effects that you can produce from hypnosis where you can

3647
01:40:47.991 --> 01:40:51.830
take like a popsicle and put it on someone's skin and tell them that it's hot

3648
01:40:51.831 --> 01:40:54.820
red poker and a blisters will just erupt on the scale.

3649
01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:56.240
Yeah.

3650
01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:56.750
Really?

3651
01:40:56.750 --> 01:40:57.550
Yeah.

3652
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:59.440
Is there though the amazing,

3653
01:40:59.441 --> 01:41:02.590
Randy looked into this and accepted that as this million dollar challenge,

3654
01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:07.060
but it seems like something that would be evidence of some weird force of the

3655
01:41:07.061 --> 01:41:07.840
mind.

3656
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:07.991
Oh,

3657
01:41:07.991 --> 01:41:08.261
they're,

3658
01:41:08.261 --> 01:41:09.370
they're incredible thing.

3659
01:41:09.371 --> 01:41:09.611
I mean,

3660
01:41:09.611 --> 01:41:10.091
I'll give you,

3661
01:41:10.091 --> 01:41:11.290
this is something I've never,

3662
01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:13.380
I don't think I've ever talked about this a,

3663
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:14.530
not that it's a big,

3664
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:15.640
big discovery or anything,

3665
01:41:15.641 --> 01:41:16.960
but when I was in Japan,

3666
01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.910
this is a lesser example of this,

3667
01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:20.100
but,

3668
01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:20.271
uh,

3669
01:41:20.271 --> 01:41:21.280
I was training,

3670
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:22.600
this is long time ago,

3671
01:41:22.601 --> 01:41:23.381
when I was 15,

3672
01:41:23.381 --> 01:41:26.080
16 and I was in the judo club.

3673
01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:27.690
I was recruited to be in the judo clubs.

3674
01:41:27.710 --> 01:41:31.840
That was like my introduction to submission was judo and uh,

3675
01:41:32.170 --> 01:41:33.430
had the wrestling background and what not.

3676
01:41:33.431 --> 01:41:33.701
But I,

3677
01:41:33.701 --> 01:41:34.030
I,

3678
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:38.140
I got my ass did just handed to me and my first tournament because I was like

3679
01:41:38.141 --> 01:41:39.310
the big fish in the little pond.

3680
01:41:39.311 --> 01:41:43.090
And then I had this killer just eat and like seven seconds destroyed me.

3681
01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.840
So I started training after my normal practice at Tokai University,

3682
01:41:46.841 --> 01:41:48.580
which has an insane judo program.

3683
01:41:48.581 --> 01:41:50.020
They're like the Iowa Hawkeyes of,

3684
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:52.300
of the judo world along with a couple of other schools.

3685
01:41:53.050 --> 01:41:53.883
And uh,

3686
01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:55.120
it's an incredible school.

3687
01:41:55.121 --> 01:41:59.260
But at one point they had this really high ranking old judo competitor come in

3688
01:41:59.261 --> 01:41:59.950
to do a demo,

3689
01:41:59.950 --> 01:42:00.783
like a class.

3690
01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:03.790
And one of the instructors was there to be,

3691
01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:04.290
uh,

3692
01:42:04.290 --> 01:42:04.660
okay,

3693
01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:09.660
like to get thrown around and we were working on a foot sweep specifically and

3694
01:42:09.731 --> 01:42:09.831
uh,

3695
01:42:09.831 --> 01:42:10.451
the old guy was like,

3696
01:42:10.451 --> 01:42:10.661
all right,

3697
01:42:10.661 --> 01:42:12.100
it's going to look kind of like this.

3698
01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:12.581
And he's like,

3699
01:42:12.581 --> 01:42:14.040
this is what the motion looks like.

3700
01:42:14.041 --> 01:42:15.910
Like you lead the guy to the right like shuffle,

3701
01:42:15.911 --> 01:42:16.391
shuffle,

3702
01:42:16.391 --> 01:42:16.901
sweep.

3703
01:42:16.901 --> 01:42:17.321
And he's like,

3704
01:42:17.321 --> 01:42:17.561
okay,

3705
01:42:17.561 --> 01:42:18.281
so this is what it looks like.

3706
01:42:18.281 --> 01:42:18.971
Shovel shovel it.

3707
01:42:18.971 --> 01:42:19.900
But he wasn't doing the throat,

3708
01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:23.810
he was just like showing the movement and he went to show the steps and the,

3709
01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:25.420
the instructor who was going to get thrown,

3710
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:29.710
like preemptively thought the guy was gonna sweep and then just went up

3711
01:42:29.711 --> 01:42:30.670
completely horizontal.

3712
01:42:30.671 --> 01:42:32.710
Like he'd been leg swept and fell.

3713
01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.850
And the older guys like,

3714
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:34.750
what the fuck are you doing?

3715
01:42:34.751 --> 01:42:35.011
I'm like,

3716
01:42:35.011 --> 01:42:35.831
I'm going to throw you to get,

3717
01:42:35.831 --> 01:42:36.071
he said,

3718
01:42:36.071 --> 01:42:36.611
get back up.

3719
01:42:36.611 --> 01:42:37.070
You know,

3720
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.720
only fallen,

3721
01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:38.553
I actually throw you,

3722
01:42:38.830 --> 01:42:39.670
but the,

3723
01:42:40.030 --> 01:42:45.030
the physics involved of like making yourself go horizontal from a fake leg

3724
01:42:45.131 --> 01:42:45.371
sweep.

3725
01:42:45.371 --> 01:42:45.551
Like,

3726
01:42:45.551 --> 01:42:46.061
if that guy,

3727
01:42:46.061 --> 01:42:48.250
if I paid that guy thousand dollars to recreate what he did,

3728
01:42:48.251 --> 01:42:49.110
he wouldn't have been able to do it.

3729
01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:52.390
It was just like the craziest

3730
01:42:54.100 --> 01:42:56.320
phantom leg sweep fall I've ever seen.

3731
01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:59.680
But he couldn't have done like if you asked him to re replicate it wouldn't have

3732
01:42:59.681 --> 01:42:59.780
been.

3733
01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:00.940
So he just,

3734
01:43:00.941 --> 01:43:01.421
first of all,

3735
01:43:01.421 --> 01:43:04.120
he was proficient in the martial arts to know what the correct,

3736
01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:08.170
what would happen to his buddies and he was so enamored with this guy that he

3737
01:43:08.171 --> 01:43:09.910
wanted to be ultra cooperative.

3738
01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:10.210
Yeah.

3739
01:43:10.210 --> 01:43:10.391
Yeah.

3740
01:43:10.391 --> 01:43:11.071
He was nervous.

3741
01:43:11.071 --> 01:43:13.120
You're nervous help the throw along.

3742
01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:13.391
Yeah,

3743
01:43:13.391 --> 01:43:13.841
exactly.

3744
01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:16.570
Cause like the old judo guys are fucking cantankerous.

3745
01:43:16.571 --> 01:43:21.310
They're like just angry old guys and they just did you know Jean labelle's known

3746
01:43:21.311 --> 01:43:24.160
for like demonstrating moves on people and hurting him.

3747
01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.290
Choke out Steven Seagal on a Saturday.

3748
01:43:26.291 --> 01:43:26.950
I just a rumor.

3749
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:27.700
Yes.

3750
01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:27.950
Yeah.

3751
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:29.170
No it's not a robot at all.

3752
01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:30.730
I heard it directly from his mouth.

3753
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:34.960
The way he tells it was really funny to give some background.

3754
01:43:34.961 --> 01:43:37.560
I go choke them unconscious [inaudible] he just got tired,

3755
01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:39.130
tired of decided to take a nap.

3756
01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.473
Just pants.

3757
01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:42.671
Cause Labelle,

3758
01:43:42.671 --> 01:43:42.971
I mean,

3759
01:43:42.971 --> 01:43:43.960
labella had it easy.

3760
01:43:43.961 --> 01:43:44.231
Yes.

3761
01:43:44.231 --> 01:43:46.600
Some chops with like Aau judo,

3762
01:43:46.601 --> 01:43:48.340
but he stomach for decades,

3763
01:43:48.341 --> 01:43:48.580
right?

3764
01:43:48.580 --> 01:43:48.881
Yeah.

3765
01:43:48.881 --> 01:43:49.181
Yeah.

3766
01:43:49.181 --> 01:43:50.260
And he also,

3767
01:43:50.261 --> 01:43:50.740
um,

3768
01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:51.290
he,

3769
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.590
um,

3770
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:52.423
I think,

3771
01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:53.590
<v 1>I forget the guy's name,</v>

3772
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.800
I'm gonna say Milo savage,

3773
01:43:54.801 --> 01:43:55.730
I forget the guy's name,

3774
01:43:55.880 --> 01:43:56.391
but he had a,

3775
01:43:56.391 --> 01:43:56.660
uh,

3776
01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:58.790
like an MMA type fight with a boxer,

3777
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.530
you know,

3778
01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:01.220
it was a judo versus boxing fight.

3779
01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.100
And I think he made the guy where it Geeky,

3780
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:05.053
smart move,

3781
01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:06.321
I think so.

3782
01:44:06.321 --> 01:44:07.160
I can't remember.

3783
01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:10.700
But he'd beat the shit out of the guy and just sort of held him down,

3784
01:44:10.730 --> 01:44:11.750
flipped him on his back.

3785
01:44:11.751 --> 01:44:11.931
I mean,

3786
01:44:11.931 --> 01:44:12.741
once he got ahold of you,

3787
01:44:12.741 --> 01:44:14.930
he was bear strong and he was,

3788
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:15.201
you know,

3789
01:44:15.201 --> 01:44:16.820
legit black belt in judo,

3790
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:18.230
national competitor.

3791
01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:18.921
He was,

3792
01:44:18.921 --> 01:44:19.461
he was very,

3793
01:44:19.461 --> 01:44:20.120
very legit.

3794
01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.140
He taught a lot of people.

3795
01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:21.390
My,

3796
01:44:21.390 --> 01:44:22.071
one of my first,

3797
01:44:22.071 --> 01:44:22.670
uh,

3798
01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:24.690
instructors is this Guy Silvio Preventa,

3799
01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:26.420
who was a black belt,

3800
01:44:26.421 --> 01:44:28.910
who is a Brazilian guy who was actually a black belt in a gene in the Bell,

3801
01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:29.690
Huh?

3802
01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:29.961
Yeah.

3803
01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:30.710
So gene,

3804
01:44:30.710 --> 01:44:31.400
he like,

3805
01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:35.840
he knew a lot of a judo finishing holes and they also like knew a lot of the old

3806
01:44:36.020 --> 01:44:38.900
catch wrestling pro wrestling holds as well.

3807
01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:39.591
There was a lot,

3808
01:44:39.591 --> 01:44:43.250
there's a lot of like old school submission techniques and a lot of people had

3809
01:44:43.251 --> 01:44:48.110
forgotten the Chine labelle sorta like re reestablished to gnarly stuff.

3810
01:44:48.111 --> 01:44:51.860
I mean like finger locks and all sorts of like weird ass toll Holton Shit.

3811
01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:56.000
Just like small digit manipulation like Aha could develop the whole book for

3812
01:44:56.001 --> 01:44:58.460
police officers on how to choke people at the clubs,

3813
01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:00.380
how to use the club,

3814
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:04.040
you know to control somebody because you got a club around someone's neck and

3815
01:45:04.041 --> 01:45:06.200
you have like Jujitsu logic,

3816
01:45:06.230 --> 01:45:07.460
you know judo logic,

3817
01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.320
leverage and technique.

3818
01:45:09.650 --> 01:45:13.370
Like you could really fuck somebody up at the club now and he shows you how to

3819
01:45:13.371 --> 01:45:17.180
choke people unconscious and break arms and retain and detain them.

3820
01:45:17.181 --> 01:45:17.751
You know like you know,

3821
01:45:17.751 --> 01:45:21.770
you get a guy across the neck and get an under hook on one side and crank that

3822
01:45:21.771 --> 01:45:24.120
thing in front of his face and grabbed them.

3823
01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:24.621
I was like,

3824
01:45:24.621 --> 01:45:26.240
get an over hook on the other side.

3825
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:27.320
Hold on to the,

3826
01:45:27.430 --> 01:45:27.710
you know,

3827
01:45:27.710 --> 01:45:30.210
you forget that fucking club that in front of your neck now.

3828
01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:30.580
Yeah.

3829
01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:34.700
You're going to move around freely developed like a whole style based on choking

3830
01:45:34.701 --> 01:45:35.810
people with clubs.

3831
01:45:35.811 --> 01:45:40.250
You have an opinion and the opinion of a c lot or uh,

3832
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:42.470
like knife fighting from the Philippines and Indonesia.

3833
01:45:42.471 --> 01:45:44.450
I know like Dan Inosanto style stuff.

3834
01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:44.631
Well,

3835
01:45:44.631 --> 01:45:47.620
I'm sure there's gotta be a technique to doing it.

3836
01:45:47.710 --> 01:45:48.261
It was just like,

3837
01:45:48.261 --> 01:45:51.200
there's a technique to sword fighting and Kendo and there's a technique to,

3838
01:45:51.201 --> 01:45:53.840
I just don't know what's the best technique.

3839
01:45:53.930 --> 01:45:55.520
It's like when it comes to fighting.

3840
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.760
Okay.

3841
01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:59.660
For the longest time people thought that like wing Chung was the shit,

3842
01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:00.170
you know,

3843
01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:03.050
because that was what they had in their area and that's what they practice.

3844
01:46:03.051 --> 01:46:07.010
It's like you need to get all the standup styles together in order to figure out

3845
01:46:07.011 --> 01:46:08.060
what's really effective,

3846
01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:09.500
what techniques really work.

3847
01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:10.191
And that's,

3848
01:46:10.191 --> 01:46:10.700
you know,

3849
01:46:10.700 --> 01:46:12.590
essentially what we're doing and the ultimate fighting championship.

3850
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:15.410
I don't believe that people are doing that with knife fighting.

3851
01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:16.310
I might be wrong.

3852
01:46:16.340 --> 01:46:16.730
I might,

3853
01:46:16.730 --> 01:46:17.270
I could,

3854
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:18.380
I could stand corrected,

3855
01:46:18.710 --> 01:46:21.680
but I don't think it's been done to the extent that,

3856
01:46:21.770 --> 01:46:22.370
you know,

3857
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.641
the,

3858
01:46:22.641 --> 01:46:24.050
the way of analyzing it,

3859
01:46:24.051 --> 01:46:25.310
the way MMA has been.

3860
01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:26.480
You're wrong.

3861
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:26.781
Oh No,

3862
01:46:26.781 --> 01:46:27.614
definitely not.

3863
01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.390
So like when you say like see lot,

3864
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.021
I'd have to say,

3865
01:46:30.021 --> 01:46:31.460
well how many other people are knife fighting,

3866
01:46:31.610 --> 01:46:32.210
you know,

3867
01:46:32.210 --> 01:46:33.350
is there a school?

3868
01:46:33.850 --> 01:46:34.070
Yeah,

3869
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.761
I have no idea.

3870
01:46:34.761 --> 01:46:38.210
I mean I just might be traveling to Indonesia in the next few months.

3871
01:46:38.211 --> 01:46:38.600
So it was like,

3872
01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:38.930
ah,

3873
01:46:38.930 --> 01:46:40.820
like you might learn something while you're out there,

3874
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:42.320
check it out in between.

3875
01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:43.353
By stab you

3876
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:46.303
see lot,

3877
01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:48.950
I'd really prefer not to get,

3878
01:46:49.540 --> 01:46:50.160
sounds like a bad

3879
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.760
<v 3>afternoon with a rubber knife that would suck hard rubber knives that she could</v>

3880
01:46:53.761 --> 01:46:55.660
easily break a rib or something like that.

3881
01:46:55.890 --> 01:46:56.611
Rubber knife.

3882
01:46:56.611 --> 01:46:59.870
I won't be jabbed with a hard plastic knife.

3883
01:46:59.871 --> 01:47:00.220
Forget it.

3884
01:47:00.220 --> 01:47:00.481
Yeah.

3885
01:47:00.481 --> 01:47:03.930
Some author wants to come over here and learn how to do some life.

3886
01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:05.461
That's actually,

3887
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:05.840
well,

3888
01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:06.151
you know,

3889
01:47:06.151 --> 01:47:07.630
it's funny because that's been a,

3890
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:11.670
it's like I've had some weird fucking,

3891
01:47:12.210 --> 01:47:13.043
uh,

3892
01:47:13.530 --> 01:47:15.230
like this Chinese Kung Fu master guy,

3893
01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:16.710
not him specifically,

3894
01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.940
but I've had folks come up and want to like demonstrate like didn't mock and

3895
01:47:21.300 --> 01:47:23.720
show me dim mocket speaking events or whatever.

3896
01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:26.130
Fill in the blank like mystical technique,

3897
01:47:26.610 --> 01:47:29.940
karate chop your neck in mock explaining to people don't,

3898
01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:30.990
well Tim Maag,

3899
01:47:30.991 --> 01:47:31.824
I mean if you seen like,

3900
01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.341
you know,

3901
01:47:32.341 --> 01:47:33.750
blood sports death touch,

3902
01:47:33.751 --> 01:47:34.200
right?

3903
01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:34.680
Yeah.

3904
01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:35.513
With uh,

3905
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:36.780
actually as Da,

3906
01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:37.673
what is it?

3907
01:47:38.970 --> 01:47:40.290
The characters in Chinese,

3908
01:47:40.291 --> 01:47:40.840
me in,

3909
01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.020
uh,

3910
01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:41.390
in uh,

3911
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.600
in,

3912
01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:43.170
in a sense press artery,

3913
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:47.790
but it's death that spoons supposedly death touch where people can be like John

3914
01:47:47.791 --> 01:47:50.960
and hit you on three pressure points doing like that.

3915
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:52.050
But you can like,

3916
01:47:52.050 --> 01:47:56.530
you might die two weeks later because I kind of the north star of the North Star

3917
01:47:56.531 --> 01:47:57.720
and with Moose jaw strike,

3918
01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:59.173
uh,

3919
01:47:59.230 --> 01:48:00.090
it was just like,

3920
01:48:00.370 --> 01:48:01.650
what is fist of the North Star?

3921
01:48:01.651 --> 01:48:05.160
What does that is a Japanese comic book about that pressure points where like

3922
01:48:05.170 --> 01:48:09.000
even had some ones that he pushed and hooked on.

3923
01:48:09.001 --> 01:48:09.600
Okay.

3924
01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:09.820
Yeah,

3925
01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:11.580
that was good stuff,

3926
01:48:11.581 --> 01:48:13.350
but I'm not sure where I was going with that.

3927
01:48:14.740 --> 01:48:15.573
I know I need more.

3928
01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:16.433
I need more coffee.

3929
01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:17.573
Uh

3930
01:48:18.780 --> 01:48:19.613
hmm

3931
01:48:20.970 --> 01:48:21.803
Democ.

3932
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:22.380
Oh yeah,

3933
01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:22.700
yeah.

3934
01:48:22.700 --> 01:48:24.050
Did people want to explain it to?

3935
01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:24.871
Oh yeah.

3936
01:48:24.871 --> 01:48:27.630
I want to show you if like weird is one like come up and like,

3937
01:48:27.631 --> 01:48:27.841
Hey,

3938
01:48:27.841 --> 01:48:28.651
let me show you this.

3939
01:48:28.651 --> 01:48:31.710
Like Houdini style punched me in the stomach thing.

3940
01:48:31.711 --> 01:48:31.981
I'm like,

3941
01:48:31.981 --> 01:48:32.431
no dude,

3942
01:48:32.431 --> 01:48:34.590
I just did like a 30 minute tech presentation.

3943
01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:35.424
Why the fuck would I leave?

3944
01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:36.640
Like punch me in the kidney.

3945
01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:37.741
It is true.

3946
01:48:37.741 --> 01:48:38.071
You do.

3947
01:48:38.071 --> 01:48:39.600
You have deceased my master,

3948
01:48:39.660 --> 01:48:40.080
right?

3949
01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:40.291
Yeah.

3950
01:48:40.291 --> 01:48:41.124
Something along those lines.

3951
01:48:41.170 --> 01:48:43.170
You've disgraced him with your,

3952
01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.590
your bad intentions did mock is true.

3953
01:48:46.650 --> 01:48:47.520
It is my life.

3954
01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:48.540
I am a Kung Fu man.

3955
01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:50.760
I might see them on Youtube.

3956
01:48:51.390 --> 01:48:51.850
Yeah.

3957
01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:55.530
Well there's a lot of people that that want to believe all kinds of not is this,

3958
01:48:55.531 --> 01:48:57.060
it is going to do some shit.

3959
01:48:57.080 --> 01:48:57.913
Here we go.

3960
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.863
Fishing or story.

3961
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:03.180
So he was about to karate chop them there and then he let them let 'em off.

3962
01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:05.420
Now he's running out of them.

3963
01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:07.673
Pulls that guy.

3964
01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:10.441
Oh,

3965
01:49:10.441 --> 01:49:12.330
you knew it was coming and he hit him with the elbow.

3966
01:49:13.770 --> 01:49:14.011
Yeah,

3967
01:49:14.011 --> 01:49:15.180
that sounds like Kung Fu.

3968
01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:18.590
That was why I think it's so appealing to uh,

3969
01:49:18.740 --> 01:49:20.250
to urban folks.

3970
01:49:20.610 --> 01:49:24.180
Like what they really liked about Kung Fu was the theater of it.

3971
01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:24.931
Like the,

3972
01:49:24.931 --> 01:49:27.330
the idea that you could have like magic,

3973
01:49:27.331 --> 01:49:28.650
like there was so it's so cool.

3974
01:49:28.651 --> 01:49:29.960
It was like a flare to it.

3975
01:49:31.020 --> 01:49:33.000
Like Ninjas in the 80s you remember like,

3976
01:49:33.001 --> 01:49:33.930
yes man.

3977
01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:36.960
It just saying and so I bought all the Ninja books,

3978
01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:39.720
all the how to Ninja two books back in the day.

3979
01:49:39.900 --> 01:49:44.900
And every single person demoing anything had a mullet yes in every Ninja book

3980
01:49:45.450 --> 01:49:47.740
and they were all crazy.

3981
01:49:47.741 --> 01:49:49.690
I remember there was one guy,

3982
01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:52.300
and I remember they would ask like martial artists,

3983
01:49:52.301 --> 01:49:53.320
like what their diet was.

3984
01:49:53.321 --> 01:49:56.260
I thought I would read all those match martial arts magazines and he would eat

3985
01:49:56.261 --> 01:49:57.130
all Japanese stuff.

3986
01:49:57.130 --> 01:49:57.281
Me.

3987
01:49:57.281 --> 01:49:58.450
So soup and you know,

3988
01:49:58.451 --> 01:50:01.060
and all these different stuff that he would eat in the morning,

3989
01:50:01.090 --> 01:50:02.710
a traditional Japanese breakfast.

3990
01:50:03.190 --> 01:50:05.140
Like he was like totally completely into it.

3991
01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:10.320
Walking around there with is who has two towed or the tubby tubby tubby shoes

3992
01:50:10.391 --> 01:50:10.930
on,

3993
01:50:10.930 --> 01:50:12.820
throwing fucking shitty karate kicks.

3994
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:15.190
Have you ever heard of the marathon monks?

3995
01:50:15.191 --> 01:50:17.410
Have you heard of these guys know these are legit,

3996
01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.011
these are there.

3997
01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:18.190
Uh,

3998
01:50:18.190 --> 01:50:23.190
it's a specific as order of monks and their meditation is long distance running,

3999
01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:25.630
like ultra endurance running.

4000
01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:29.080
So they'll wear these wovens sandals and they'll run.

4001
01:50:29.081 --> 01:50:34.081
They were willing of one or more marathons a day and uh,

4002
01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:36.550
they subsist on next to nothing.

4003
01:50:36.551 --> 01:50:38.560
I mean it's just these,

4004
01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:41.230
the feats of endurance are astonishing.

4005
01:50:41.231 --> 01:50:41.970
So their,

4006
01:50:41.970 --> 01:50:43.980
their practice rather than sitting for eight hours,

4007
01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:44.980
it was run for eight hours.

4008
01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:46.690
Pretty cool.

4009
01:50:46.690 --> 01:50:47.420
Uh,

4010
01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.310
I always felt like,

4011
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:49.000
um,

4012
01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.460
martial arts were a form of moving meditation.

4013
01:50:51.850 --> 01:50:52.001
Oh,

4014
01:50:52.001 --> 01:50:52.690
for sure.

4015
01:50:52.690 --> 01:50:53.081
I think,

4016
01:50:53.081 --> 01:50:53.710
you know,

4017
01:50:53.710 --> 01:50:55.000
hard cardio can be as well.

4018
01:50:55.001 --> 01:50:55.810
Right.

4019
01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:56.890
I think that anything that,

4020
01:50:56.920 --> 01:51:00.160
that brings your attention to the present tense,

4021
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:02.200
for me at least as meditation,

4022
01:51:02.201 --> 01:51:03.250
I mean like when I go to the gym,

4023
01:51:03.251 --> 01:51:03.611
people are like,

4024
01:51:03.611 --> 01:51:03.761
oh,

4025
01:51:03.761 --> 01:51:04.211
like who did you,

4026
01:51:04.211 --> 01:51:04.841
who do you train with them?

4027
01:51:04.841 --> 01:51:05.920
Like I treat myself,

4028
01:51:05.921 --> 01:51:06.071
man,

4029
01:51:06.071 --> 01:51:06.904
if I'm doing lifting,

4030
01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:09.130
that is my meditative time.

4031
01:51:09.190 --> 01:51:12.040
That is when I'm like focusing on cadence numbers,

4032
01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:12.431
reps,

4033
01:51:12.431 --> 01:51:12.791
whatever,

4034
01:51:12.791 --> 01:51:13.720
and nothing else.

4035
01:51:14.170 --> 01:51:15.400
Just creating a vacuum,

4036
01:51:15.401 --> 01:51:18.460
like a negative space so I can actually recover from the overstimulation from

4037
01:51:18.461 --> 01:51:19.294
the rest of the day.

4038
01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:19.680
Yeah.

4039
01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:19.931
It's a,

4040
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:23.530
isn't it a fascinating thing about the human mind is that that that is sort of

4041
01:51:23.531 --> 01:51:28.531
like a thing that you need to do in order to sort of reset things to the

4042
01:51:29.470 --> 01:51:32.050
managing the way the mind works.

4043
01:51:32.051 --> 01:51:36.910
Managing and kind of like the diagramming it and understanding it and trying to,

4044
01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:37.420
it's,

4045
01:51:37.420 --> 01:51:40.060
there's so many weird aspects of it that are like,

4046
01:51:40.090 --> 01:51:40.511
oh,

4047
01:51:40.511 --> 01:51:40.781
okay,

4048
01:51:40.781 --> 01:51:42.340
well you need to shut off.

4049
01:51:42.430 --> 01:51:42.760
Yeah.

4050
01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:42.851
Oh,

4051
01:51:42.851 --> 01:51:43.451
you need those.

4052
01:51:43.451 --> 01:51:46.540
Sit in a room and think about your life and just stare at a wall and then that

4053
01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:48.250
it actually makes you work better.

4054
01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:51.550
Sit there and just concentrate on only breathing while I'm not doing anything.

4055
01:51:51.551 --> 01:51:51.710
No,

4056
01:51:51.710 --> 01:51:52.060
no.

4057
01:51:52.060 --> 01:51:54.640
Concentrate on only breathing and the brain would work better.

4058
01:51:54.670 --> 01:51:55.570
Like it needs a break.

4059
01:51:55.640 --> 01:51:55.890
Yeah.

4060
01:51:55.890 --> 01:51:58.450
Like let the rpms subside and it'll,

4061
01:51:58.510 --> 01:51:59.291
it'll be good.

4062
01:51:59.291 --> 01:52:03.250
And then it'll kind of give you a better assessment of where you're at without

4063
01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:07.000
any influence of stress or hormonal or weird,

4064
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.361
you know,

4065
01:52:07.361 --> 01:52:09.700
sort of pressure of your environment,

4066
01:52:09.701 --> 01:52:10.211
all that stuff.

4067
01:52:10.211 --> 01:52:12.070
You can sort of shut off a little bit.

4068
01:52:12.250 --> 01:52:12.941
And when you do that,

4069
01:52:12.941 --> 01:52:13.774
the mind works better.

4070
01:52:13.930 --> 01:52:18.590
How do you decompress or sort of clean the slate when you,

4071
01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:23.200
when you're overstimulated or feeling overwhelmed by too many projects,

4072
01:52:23.201 --> 01:52:23.821
too many balls,

4073
01:52:23.821 --> 01:52:24.371
too many emails,

4074
01:52:24.371 --> 01:52:25.450
whatever it might be.

4075
01:52:25.520 --> 01:52:27.040
Aside from the flotation tank,

4076
01:52:27.041 --> 01:52:28.720
is there anything in particular that you use?

4077
01:52:28.721 --> 01:52:30.070
Any rituals or anything like that?

4078
01:52:30.100 --> 01:52:31.450
The tank is the big one.

4079
01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:31.700
Yeah.

4080
01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:32.291
So I have it.

4081
01:52:32.291 --> 01:52:35.260
So why would I do anything else and what's the best method is not,

4082
01:52:35.261 --> 01:52:37.090
there's no better method in my opinion.

4083
01:52:37.091 --> 01:52:39.610
There's never been in an environment like it created.

4084
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:41.900
It's to not capitalize on it.

4085
01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:46.250
Like people that don't use sensory deprivation tanks that could use sensory

4086
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:47.990
<v 0>deprivation tanks are crazy.</v>

4087
01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:48.500
Yeah.

4088
01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:52.820
Like why would you not have access to something that gives you complete total

4089
01:52:52.821 --> 01:52:53.654
silence?

4090
01:52:53.870 --> 01:52:54.860
Complete the,

4091
01:52:54.861 --> 01:52:55.730
if you're a thinker,

4092
01:52:55.731 --> 01:52:58.670
if you're someone who makes a living in some sort of creative form,

4093
01:52:58.671 --> 01:53:03.260
creating things that the opportunity to have some time alone with your thoughts

4094
01:53:03.261 --> 01:53:04.820
like that is so unique.

4095
01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:08.960
There's no other time where your body is just off,

4096
01:53:09.170 --> 01:53:10.130
just shuts off.

4097
01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:13.010
You don't feel your feet touching the ground.

4098
01:53:13.011 --> 01:53:14.540
You'll feel your ass touching a seat.

4099
01:53:14.541 --> 01:53:15.920
You don't feel a damn thing.

4100
01:53:16.020 --> 01:53:16.280
Yeah.

4101
01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:19.010
It's a loan with your mind and because of that,

4102
01:53:19.011 --> 01:53:20.270
it's like every other method.

4103
01:53:20.271 --> 01:53:20.780
To me,

4104
01:53:20.780 --> 01:53:21.141
it's like,

4105
01:53:21.141 --> 01:53:21.861
you know when someone says,

4106
01:53:21.861 --> 01:53:21.981
well,

4107
01:53:21.981 --> 01:53:23.240
I don't need to isolation tank.

4108
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:24.103
I meditate.

4109
01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:25.250
Meditating on a tank,

4110
01:53:25.251 --> 01:53:25.940
it's better.

4111
01:53:25.940 --> 01:53:26.240
Yeah,

4112
01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:26.661
it's better.

4113
01:53:26.661 --> 01:53:27.560
It's the best environment.

4114
01:53:27.561 --> 01:53:28.251
Like sitting there,

4115
01:53:28.251 --> 01:53:32.210
cross legged is not as good as being in a fucking sensory deprivation tank

4116
01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:33.890
that's heated up with water.

4117
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:37.130
That's the same temperature as the surface of your skin and there's a thousand

4118
01:53:37.130 --> 01:53:39.920
pounds of salt in it and you're floating and it's completely silent.

4119
01:53:40.210 --> 01:53:40.790
No,

4120
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:41.240
you're,

4121
01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.073
that's better.

4122
01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:43.130
That's the best way.

4123
01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:43.731
You know?

4124
01:53:43.731 --> 01:53:44.391
That's like saying,

4125
01:53:44.391 --> 01:53:45.440
I don't need a car.

4126
01:53:45.441 --> 01:53:48.410
I can walk you walk stupid,

4127
01:53:48.411 --> 01:53:50.930
but it'll take way longer and it won't be as fun.

4128
01:53:51.110 --> 01:53:51.421
And you,

4129
01:53:51.421 --> 01:53:52.610
you don't even have a stereo.

4130
01:53:53.390 --> 01:53:53.871
What if you're,

4131
01:53:53.871 --> 01:53:54.561
when you're traveling,

4132
01:53:54.561 --> 01:53:57.800
what do you do or is it just you make do until they get back to until I get

4133
01:53:57.801 --> 01:53:58.280
back.

4134
01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:58.670
But uh,

4135
01:53:58.670 --> 01:54:02.570
if I'm particularly stressed I'll just put it in a hard workout.

4136
01:54:02.571 --> 01:54:04.820
It usually goes away in little porn hub at the end.

4137
01:54:05.570 --> 01:54:05.920
Yeah.

4138
01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.040
Little that'll how that helps.

4139
01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:07.681
But the,

4140
01:54:07.681 --> 01:54:08.481
the hard workouts,

4141
01:54:08.481 --> 01:54:09.314
the most important thing,

4142
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:14.530
the porno by itself just as fucking doesn't really let you go to sleep and then

4143
01:54:15.321 --> 01:54:17.030
you wake up in the morning for more feverish.

4144
01:54:17.770 --> 01:54:18.580
The uh,

4145
01:54:18.580 --> 01:54:19.640
the body needs to work,

4146
01:54:19.641 --> 01:54:20.660
man eats and eats it.

4147
01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:24.440
It stores energy in case something happens.

4148
01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:29.270
So if you're the type of person like me who your entire life has been doing like

4149
01:54:29.271 --> 01:54:30.470
strenuous activity,

4150
01:54:30.471 --> 01:54:34.430
the body has really adapted to doing strenuous activity on regular basis.

4151
01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:34.760
Yeah.

4152
01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:35.593
So if I don't,

4153
01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:38.060
if I take a few days off of any strenuous activity,

4154
01:54:38.061 --> 01:54:38.271
it's like,

4155
01:54:38.271 --> 01:54:39.104
come on,

4156
01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:40.590
what are we doing?

4157
01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:42.880
I got a lot of fucking excess shit here.

4158
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:43.220
Like,

4159
01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:44.450
I've been making all this stuff.

4160
01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:44.781
Um,

4161
01:54:44.781 --> 01:54:44.991
you know,

4162
01:54:44.991 --> 01:54:46.670
I'm ready to go at a moment's notice.

4163
01:54:46.671 --> 01:54:47.061
We're going to lift,

4164
01:54:47.061 --> 01:54:48.500
some weights are going to throw some people around.

4165
01:54:48.501 --> 01:54:49.160
What are we doing?

4166
01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:49.993
We're not doing anything.

4167
01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.040
So then it starts getting really aggressive,

4168
01:54:52.041 --> 01:54:53.900
like a dog that you don't take out for walks.

4169
01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:54.490
So,

4170
01:54:54.490 --> 01:54:54.740
you know,

4171
01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:57.020
have you ever had a dog and grew up with two big dogs?

4172
01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.660
You don't take it for walks and then you know,

4173
01:54:58.670 --> 01:55:00.350
they get fucking crazy and they don't,

4174
01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:01.490
they don't know how to relax.

4175
01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:02.960
But if you take the dog out,

4176
01:55:02.961 --> 01:55:03.794
you throw the ball,

4177
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:04.770
then the dogs were relaxed.

4178
01:55:04.771 --> 01:55:06.530
It was a calm dogs like you could re,

4179
01:55:06.531 --> 01:55:10.280
it's really obvious and you can learn from dogs and you think that just because

4180
01:55:10.281 --> 01:55:14.300
you have a mind that you're not subject to the same sort of stimuli,

4181
01:55:14.690 --> 01:55:18.530
the same sort of input that your body's giving you that a dog is,

4182
01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:19.693
of course you are,

4183
01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:20.001
you're,

4184
01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:22.400
your body wants to run around to and you're not doing it.

4185
01:55:22.401 --> 01:55:23.390
So it's going to go crazy.

4186
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.931
And you think,

4187
01:55:23.931 --> 01:55:24.201
well,

4188
01:55:24.201 --> 01:55:29.201
I'm a gentleman and the gentleman can can contain himself and I can just keep

4189
01:55:29.241 --> 01:55:32.990
myself in check and I'll come home and my kids won't even bother me and I won't

4190
01:55:33.370 --> 01:55:38.370
want to hit the fucking parrot with a shoe who bought a damn pat and you want to

4191
01:55:38.481 --> 01:55:39.770
kill that fucking thing.

4192
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:40.400
Why?

4193
01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.970
Because you're imbalanced because your body is storing all this extra killed

4194
01:55:44.971 --> 01:55:48.780
juice and there's a fucking squawking burden your living room.

4195
01:55:49.020 --> 01:55:49.853
But meanwhile,

4196
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:52.860
have you just got back from a marathon and you probably talked to that bird.

4197
01:55:52.890 --> 01:55:53.723
What's up buddy?

4198
01:55:54.810 --> 01:55:56.100
Everything cool with that map?

4199
01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:57.120
You wouldn't even hate him.

4200
01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:57.911
You know,

4201
01:55:57.911 --> 01:55:58.351
he'd be like,

4202
01:55:58.351 --> 01:55:58.950
he's fine.

4203
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:59.783
It's just a bird.

4204
01:56:01.810 --> 01:56:03.750
Because I was processing,

4205
01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.170
it was like a cola and I was just processing.

4206
01:56:07.171 --> 01:56:07.561
But the,

4207
01:56:07.561 --> 01:56:11.070
I was trying to explain a very hard to,

4208
01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:16.430
hard to rationalize concept or hard to,

4209
01:56:16.431 --> 01:56:16.770
uh,

4210
01:56:16.770 --> 01:56:21.060
hard to appreciate concept for a person that doesn't have that kind of a body or

4211
01:56:21.061 --> 01:56:24.300
a person who doesn't have that kind of a lifestyle or that kind of a way of

4212
01:56:24.301 --> 01:56:27.120
thinking and everybody has their own sort of activity and energy level.

4213
01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:28.500
But for some of these like a very go,

4214
01:56:28.501 --> 01:56:28.711
go,

4215
01:56:28.711 --> 01:56:29.544
go person,

4216
01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:32.040
it's very important that you have regular outlets.

4217
01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:35.790
Like you can't just accept the fact that you can turn it on and turn it off.

4218
01:56:35.791 --> 01:56:36.001
Like,

4219
01:56:36.001 --> 01:56:36.271
no,

4220
01:56:36.271 --> 01:56:36.390
it's,

4221
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.791
you have made,

4222
01:56:36.791 --> 01:56:39.030
have sort of a commitment to have this sort of a body.

4223
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:40.950
So this is the type of body you have.

4224
01:56:40.951 --> 01:56:43.410
Like there's a famous story about cyclists,

4225
01:56:43.810 --> 01:56:44.280
um,

4226
01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:48.120
that a friend of mine told me where I'm in a situation rather about cyclists

4227
01:56:48.121 --> 01:56:52.140
where when they're on EPO they have to exercise.

4228
01:56:52.290 --> 01:56:52.770
Like in,

4229
01:56:52.770 --> 01:56:56.580
oftentimes they were touring and it'd be on this bus Stang and he would hear in

4230
01:56:56.581 --> 01:56:59.910
the middle of the night one of the guys getting out of bed and pulling his bike

4231
01:56:59.911 --> 01:57:01.230
out and and running,

4232
01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:01.900
you know,

4233
01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:03.150
and dry riding his bike.

4234
01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.760
And the reason why he did it was even though they were all supposed to be

4235
01:57:05.761 --> 01:57:06.330
sleeping,

4236
01:57:06.330 --> 01:57:11.330
he had EPO in his system and he absolutely had to exercise like his body was

4237
01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:15.420
producing and the exorbitant amount of red blood cells because this drug and

4238
01:57:15.421 --> 01:57:18.270
that made him a like vulnerable,

4239
01:57:18.271 --> 01:57:19.230
like his heart was,

4240
01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:19.770
you know,

4241
01:57:19.770 --> 01:57:20.730
feeling kind of funny.

4242
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:22.000
Like he's like Jesus Christ,

4243
01:57:22.001 --> 01:57:22.530
I've got to get,

4244
01:57:22.530 --> 01:57:23.430
I have too much blood.

4245
01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:25.650
You've got to got to go out there and blow off some steam.

4246
01:57:26.070 --> 01:57:27.720
And I think that is,

4247
01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:28.890
you know,

4248
01:57:28.890 --> 01:57:33.570
much like there's no free rides in terms of mental performance.

4249
01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:34.920
When I look at something where,

4250
01:57:34.921 --> 01:57:35.191
okay,

4251
01:57:35.191 --> 01:57:35.681
well what,

4252
01:57:35.681 --> 01:57:35.881
what,

4253
01:57:35.881 --> 01:57:39.000
what do you need when you're on a drug that's an enhancing thing.

4254
01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.260
You need to blow it off.

4255
01:57:40.261 --> 01:57:41.460
You need to actually exercise.

4256
01:57:41.461 --> 01:57:41.551
Well,

4257
01:57:41.551 --> 01:57:45.630
I bet you actually probably need to exercise anyway for optimum performance.

4258
01:57:45.631 --> 01:57:45.841
You know,

4259
01:57:45.841 --> 01:57:46.910
there's like your,

4260
01:57:46.930 --> 01:57:51.930
your body has to work in order to get better at working and when you,

4261
01:57:52.141 --> 01:57:55.200
you work it all the time and then you shut it off for a little while.

4262
01:57:55.201 --> 01:57:55.531
It's like,

4263
01:57:55.531 --> 01:57:56.190
come on,

4264
01:57:56.190 --> 01:57:56.470
we gotta,

4265
01:57:56.470 --> 01:57:56.740
you know,

4266
01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:58.110
you have a commitment fuck head.

4267
01:57:58.200 --> 01:57:59.730
You can't take a week off working out,

4268
01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:00.510
goddammit.

4269
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:00.781
You know,

4270
01:58:00.781 --> 01:58:02.640
and then you was just to get super stressed.

4271
01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:06.420
I remember going to Alaska on the,

4272
01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:08.210
on the Rinella trip for the,

4273
01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:13.220
for the Caribou experience and doing manual labor every day pretty much.

4274
01:58:14.761 --> 01:58:14.941
I mean,

4275
01:58:14.941 --> 01:58:16.060
just walking around,

4276
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:16.590
stalking,

4277
01:58:16.590 --> 01:58:17.640
carrying stuff,

4278
01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:19.860
whatever it might be in the cold,

4279
01:58:19.861 --> 01:58:20.101
all that.

4280
01:58:20.101 --> 01:58:20.940
You got the worst of that.

4281
01:58:21.390 --> 01:58:22.223
Uh,

4282
01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:27.390
and having no fatigue during the day whatsoever and immediately falling asleep.

4283
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.931
Yeah.

4284
01:58:27.931 --> 01:58:30.090
That was the same exact experience I had.

4285
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.860
Same exact Karen's credible,

4286
01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:34.080
no fatigue during the day whatsoever.

4287
01:58:34.110 --> 01:58:35.280
No need for naps,

4288
01:58:35.670 --> 01:58:36.840
constant sweating,

4289
01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:38.160
constantly running out of breath,

4290
01:58:38.161 --> 01:58:39.480
climbing up to the top of hills,

4291
01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:40.900
but yet wide awake,

4292
01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.000
up dinner and

4293
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:42.820
<v 3>they'll eat dinner,</v>

4294
01:58:42.820 --> 01:58:43.930
the beat dark out.

4295
01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:44.261
All right,

4296
01:58:44.261 --> 01:58:45.550
we'll see you guys at six,

4297
01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:46.510
boom out.

4298
01:58:47.240 --> 01:58:48.280
Such a wonderful feeling.

4299
01:58:48.281 --> 01:58:48.461
I mean,

4300
01:58:48.461 --> 01:58:51.100
I came back after whatever it was,

4301
01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:54.070
maybe five or six days without any calendar,

4302
01:58:54.071 --> 01:58:55.510
any iPhone,

4303
01:58:55.511 --> 01:58:56.051
any laptop,

4304
01:58:56.051 --> 01:58:56.621
any screen,

4305
01:58:56.621 --> 01:58:57.454
and he,

4306
01:58:57.610 --> 01:58:59.200
any watch,

4307
01:58:59.230 --> 01:59:00.070
anything like that,

4308
01:59:00.071 --> 01:59:00.700
no inputs,

4309
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:03.610
basically very few unnatural inputs rather.

4310
01:59:03.760 --> 01:59:08.760
And it felt like I'd taken six months off is really the reset button.

4311
01:59:09.580 --> 01:59:10.301
Reset buttons.

4312
01:59:10.301 --> 01:59:11.134
Amazing.

4313
01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:14.440
Tell me more about this 32nd sprint thing that you were going on about.

4314
01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:15.040
Oh yeah.

4315
01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:15.341
Uh,

4316
01:59:15.341 --> 01:59:16.080
I think,

4317
01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:16.370
uh,

4318
01:59:16.370 --> 01:59:18.910
Gibala G I B A L A,

4319
01:59:18.911 --> 01:59:21.580
I'm believe who's done a lot of the research,

4320
01:59:21.610 --> 01:59:25.120
and I want to say this is probably getting this wrong,

4321
01:59:25.121 --> 01:59:26.980
but something like mcallister,

4322
01:59:26.990 --> 01:59:27.410
that's a,

4323
01:59:27.410 --> 01:59:28.810
that's a street in San Francisco,

4324
01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:29.591
uh,

4325
01:59:29.591 --> 01:59:29.880
and,

4326
01:59:29.880 --> 01:59:30.910
but he's based in Canada.

4327
01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:32.040
I,

4328
01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:37.040
he's looking at repeated bouts of a maximal exertion,

4329
01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:40.510
let's say 32nd sprints on a cycle.

4330
01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:45.540
And how a total of say three to four minutes of sprints could,

4331
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:47.110
uh,

4332
01:59:47.110 --> 01:59:49.750
had comparable adaptations in the body for,

4333
01:59:49.780 --> 01:59:51.070
from an endurance standpoint,

4334
01:59:51.071 --> 01:59:52.720
not just sprinting standpoint,

4335
01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:53.980
uh,

4336
01:59:53.980 --> 01:59:58.690
as a steady state endurance for five to six hours a week.

4337
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:59.010
Yeah,

4338
01:59:59.010 --> 02:00:00.550
it's really fascinating stuff.

4339
02:00:00.551 --> 02:00:04.030
He's done a number of followup studies that have since confirmed the findings

4340
02:00:04.031 --> 02:00:06.850
and now people are also duplicating this study so it's not a one off.

4341
02:00:07.540 --> 02:00:08.373
And uh,

4342
02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:13.740
so does that mean that someone could try these sprints and do something like,

4343
02:00:14.260 --> 02:00:14.621
you know,

4344
02:00:14.621 --> 02:00:19.621
these four minutes of just a hundred percent effort for 30 seconds off for

4345
02:00:19.781 --> 02:00:24.781
whatever and back and forth for four minutes and they would be able to run a

4346
02:00:24.881 --> 02:00:25.714
marathon?

4347
02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.153
Uh,

4348
02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:28.750
I don't know if,

4349
02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:31.030
if that in and of itself would be enough,

4350
02:00:31.031 --> 02:00:36.031
although I have talked a lot about the transfer from a strength training,

4351
02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:41.830
specifically deadlifts is this fascinating to endurance running,

4352
02:00:41.831 --> 02:00:45.430
which you'd never put together necessarily if you were looking at what the,

4353
02:00:45.700 --> 02:00:46.161
what the,

4354
02:00:46.161 --> 02:00:49.030
the adaptations are supposed to be from two very different types of training,

4355
02:00:49.031 --> 02:00:51.010
but it's to end Brian Mackenzie,

4356
02:00:51.011 --> 02:00:52.030
he's these down here somewhere,

4357
02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:53.050
uh,

4358
02:00:53.050 --> 02:00:56.440
who's written a book about this and using the four hour body as well,

4359
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.980
but,

4360
02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:57.610
uh,

4361
02:00:57.610 --> 02:01:00.430
using predominantly resistance training,

4362
02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.300
deadlifts,

4363
02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:05.050
and nothing longer than 400 meter repeats.

4364
02:01:05.530 --> 02:01:10.000
Typically one or 200 meter repeats to train in eight weeks for a marathon,

4365
02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.740
like eight to 12 weeks.

4366
02:01:11.770 --> 02:01:13.450
You're ready for like a 50 miler.

4367
02:01:13.451 --> 02:01:14.470
And I've had readers do that.

4368
02:01:14.471 --> 02:01:14.950
It's insane.

4369
02:01:14.950 --> 02:01:16.270
I've had readers literally,

4370
02:01:16.450 --> 02:01:21.450
I've never run a five k and then do like a mountainous 50 k after training for

4371
02:01:21.461 --> 02:01:22.780
eight to 12 weeks using,

4372
02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:23.290
uh,

4373
02:01:23.290 --> 02:01:28.090
not having run anything longer than say a handful of miles.

4374
02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:28.961
Wow.

4375
02:01:28.961 --> 02:01:33.100
So when you get to something like ultra endurance training or triathlons and

4376
02:01:33.101 --> 02:01:33.581
something like that,

4377
02:01:33.581 --> 02:01:36.670
then there's a certain amount of conditioning that's unavoidable as far as just

4378
02:01:36.671 --> 02:01:38.530
the constant pounding on the pavement.

4379
02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:39.321
The way your,

4380
02:01:39.321 --> 02:01:41.850
your joint adapts to the fact that you're here,

4381
02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:43.340
you're doing something like that.

4382
02:01:43.341 --> 02:01:46.490
Like that's not that you don't get that sort of result,

4383
02:01:46.491 --> 02:01:47.141
but you get the,

4384
02:01:47.141 --> 02:01:49.160
the cardiovascular benefit is actually,

4385
02:01:49.161 --> 02:01:50.240
I think the opposite.

4386
02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:50.700
So it's,

4387
02:01:50.700 --> 02:01:54.860
so you're developing the strength tendon,

4388
02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:57.740
ligament strength as well as the,

4389
02:01:57.890 --> 02:01:58.160
uh,

4390
02:01:58.160 --> 02:02:00.830
what is it that they call it the ground reactive force from,

4391
02:02:00.831 --> 02:02:02.060
let's say sumo deadlifts,

4392
02:02:03.110 --> 02:02:05.480
sumo deadlifts are the fastest way to improve sprint speed,

4393
02:02:05.481 --> 02:02:05.870
by the way.

4394
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:07.280
A sumo deadlifts or,

4395
02:02:07.290 --> 02:02:08.360
or you can do conventional,

4396
02:02:08.361 --> 02:02:09.120
but what does that mean?

4397
02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.430
Sumo deadlifts is just a wide stance deadlift and you'd actually be pulling the

4398
02:02:13.431 --> 02:02:13.671
bar.

4399
02:02:13.671 --> 02:02:14.960
This trainer down here,

4400
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:15.470
he didn't,

4401
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:16.040
you should,

4402
02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:16.380
you should be.

4403
02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:17.100
This guy's amazing.

4404
02:02:17.100 --> 02:02:19.070
Barry Ross and he's trained,

4405
02:02:19.130 --> 02:02:19.490
uh,

4406
02:02:19.490 --> 02:02:23.420
he trained Allyson Felix who's incredible superstrong track and field world now

4407
02:02:24.050 --> 02:02:24.381
Brooke,

4408
02:02:24.381 --> 02:02:28.670
all sorts of world's records and his entire training program is based on the

4409
02:02:28.671 --> 02:02:30.020
dead lift Max,

4410
02:02:30.050 --> 02:02:32.450
like two to three rep Max deadlift.

4411
02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:33.313
So in other words,

4412
02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:36.200
he would have them come in do,

4413
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.800
and this is,

4414
02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:38.000
he's modified it slightly,

4415
02:02:38.001 --> 02:02:39.380
but let's just say to keep it simple,

4416
02:02:39.640 --> 02:02:44.640
a three sets of two to three reps with four to five minutes of rest in between

4417
02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:48.080
sets with plyometrics after each set.

4418
02:02:48.081 --> 02:02:53.060
So you'd do pulling like a two rep max from the ground only to your knees.

4419
02:02:53.180 --> 02:02:53.361
Okay,

4420
02:02:53.361 --> 02:02:55.280
so it's not full range of motion only to your knees.

4421
02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.890
And then you drop the bar that's devoid hamstring issues.

4422
02:02:59.030 --> 02:03:01.160
And then you do plyometrics for like,

4423
02:03:01.190 --> 02:03:04.550
you could do five jumps or you do like 10 meter sprints and then you start the

4424
02:03:04.551 --> 02:03:04.920
clock,

4425
02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:06.110
four to five minutes recovery.

4426
02:03:06.130 --> 02:03:06.980
He did the same thing again,

4427
02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:08.060
four to five minutes recovery,

4428
02:03:08.061 --> 02:03:08.894
same thing again.

4429
02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:10.610
And following that protocol,

4430
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:11.510
uh,

4431
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.841
which,

4432
02:03:11.841 --> 02:03:11.991
uh,

4433
02:03:11.991 --> 02:03:16.340
I think I called it effortless superhuman with my usual kind of hyperbole,

4434
02:03:16.341 --> 02:03:16.851
but he,

4435
02:03:16.851 --> 02:03:17.684
uh,

4436
02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:18.320
uh,

4437
02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.153
I put,

4438
02:03:19.190 --> 02:03:19.611
fuck,

4439
02:03:19.611 --> 02:03:19.991
what was it?

4440
02:03:19.991 --> 02:03:23.540
It was like 120 pounds on my Max deadlift and something like eight weeks.

4441
02:03:23.541 --> 02:03:25.100
It was insane.

4442
02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:26.090
Insane.

4443
02:03:26.090 --> 02:03:26.751
Insane,

4444
02:03:26.751 --> 02:03:27.171
insane,

4445
02:03:27.171 --> 02:03:27.770
insane.

4446
02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:31.970
That's include not believe in what the coolest part about it from the standpoint

4447
02:03:31.971 --> 02:03:32.571
of say,

4448
02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:33.650
endurance or fighting.

4449
02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:34.760
Oh my fucking God.

4450
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:39.230
Like from the standpoint of anything where you're looking for pound for pound

4451
02:03:39.231 --> 02:03:40.010
power,

4452
02:03:40.010 --> 02:03:42.470
I put on less than 10 pounds,

4453
02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:45.110
probably closer to like five pounds of muscles and nothing.

4454
02:03:45.170 --> 02:03:46.003
I mean,

4455
02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:49.020
that corresponded to that magnitude.

4456
02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:49.400
Strengths.

4457
02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:50.660
That's insane.

4458
02:03:50.661 --> 02:03:51.110
Nuts.

4459
02:03:51.110 --> 02:03:51.831
Totally,

4460
02:03:51.831 --> 02:03:52.610
totally insane.

4461
02:03:52.610 --> 02:03:53.750
How long did it last?

4462
02:03:54.230 --> 02:03:54.921
It sticks around.

4463
02:03:54.921 --> 02:03:55.461
I mean the,

4464
02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:56.850
now this is something we,

4465
02:03:56.890 --> 02:03:57.723
uh,

4466
02:03:57.900 --> 02:03:58.100
you know,

4467
02:03:58.100 --> 02:03:59.480
you and I have chatted up before,

4468
02:03:59.481 --> 02:04:01.280
but like the persistence of effect,

4469
02:04:01.490 --> 02:04:05.810
it actually sticks around a lot longer than size in my experience because the

4470
02:04:05.811 --> 02:04:07.460
size is so dependent on your eating.

4471
02:04:07.610 --> 02:04:08.170
Uh,

4472
02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:08.410
the,

4473
02:04:08.410 --> 02:04:08.660
the,

4474
02:04:08.660 --> 02:04:08.920
the,

4475
02:04:08.920 --> 02:04:13.040
the eating habits of free is one of the arguments against performance enhancing

4476
02:04:13.041 --> 02:04:16.820
drugs is that not only does a person who is used performance enhancing drugs

4477
02:04:17.090 --> 02:04:18.800
have a benefit when they using them.

4478
02:04:18.801 --> 02:04:22.010
They have a benefit when they're not using all of their bodies change.

4479
02:04:22.060 --> 02:04:22.791
The by does change.

4480
02:04:22.791 --> 02:04:25.730
So there's some really cool stuff and you know,

4481
02:04:25.731 --> 02:04:28.460
not making like a legal or moralistic judgment about it,

4482
02:04:28.461 --> 02:04:29.294
but with,

4483
02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:30.980
let's say you're using,

4484
02:04:31.090 --> 02:04:31.300
you know,

4485
02:04:31.300 --> 02:04:34.790
decker Darabowin like Nandrolone and growth hormone and all this stuff and you

4486
02:04:34.791 --> 02:04:36.230
put together a nice cocktail,

4487
02:04:36.260 --> 02:04:40.170
their results in let's just say 20 pounds of lean muscle gain.

4488
02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:42.150
Then,

4489
02:04:42.150 --> 02:04:42.983
uh,

4490
02:04:43.410 --> 02:04:44.160
well there's,

4491
02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.780
I might get the slightly off,

4492
02:04:45.781 --> 02:04:46.980
I'm sure we will correct me in the comments,

4493
02:04:46.981 --> 02:04:48.540
but there's some people that are,

4494
02:04:48.600 --> 02:04:50.490
that have argued that you,

4495
02:04:50.491 --> 02:04:54.030
you create a proliferation proliferation of what are called satellite cells.

4496
02:04:54.660 --> 02:04:57.120
And when you then go off cycle,

4497
02:04:57.190 --> 02:04:58.530
let's say you lose those 20 pounds,

4498
02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:03.840
you still retain the ability to grow muscle faster or have a higher rate of

4499
02:05:03.841 --> 02:05:07.260
hypertrophy because these satellite cells can then,

4500
02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:07.800
uh,

4501
02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:10.950
effectively form new muscle fiber.

4502
02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:13.920
And I like the muscle fibers are really cool.

4503
02:05:13.921 --> 02:05:16.290
Like the nuclei is really long.

4504
02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:20.130
I mean like in some cases like it's actually this big and uh,

4505
02:05:20.970 --> 02:05:22.470
what that means is muscle memory.

4506
02:05:22.471 --> 02:05:24.300
What people have always thought of as muscle memory.

4507
02:05:24.330 --> 02:05:25.170
It does exist.

4508
02:05:25.171 --> 02:05:28.920
I mean the physiological basis as I have last seen it at least relates to the

4509
02:05:28.921 --> 02:05:30.030
satellite cell concept.

4510
02:05:30.031 --> 02:05:31.800
So let's say you can,

4511
02:05:31.890 --> 02:05:33.240
you're taking IGF one are,

4512
02:05:33.241 --> 02:05:34.770
I mean that's getting pretty fancy,

4513
02:05:34.771 --> 02:05:38.340
but all of this stuff and you do have a persistent benefit.

4514
02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:40.110
You may lose that mass for a period of time,

4515
02:05:40.111 --> 02:05:41.970
but you can regain it in a much shorter period of time.

4516
02:05:42.570 --> 02:05:42.900
Uh,

4517
02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:44.070
when it comes to strength,

4518
02:05:44.071 --> 02:05:45.720
I found that to be very persistent.

4519
02:05:45.721 --> 02:05:49.890
So in the case of let's say the dead lift or even kettlebell swings like I love,

4520
02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:50.671
I love to,

4521
02:05:50.671 --> 02:05:52.620
and a Kettlebell swing is like my go to.

4522
02:05:52.621 --> 02:05:54.840
If I can only do one thing and I don't have a lot of time,

4523
02:05:55.110 --> 02:05:56.700
it's going to be two had kettlebell swing.

4524
02:05:56.730 --> 02:05:56.910
Yeah,

4525
02:05:56.910 --> 02:05:57.720
I agree.

4526
02:05:57.720 --> 02:06:01.830
And I find that as long as I keep my musculature,

4527
02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:02.791
like the,

4528
02:06:02.791 --> 02:06:03.660
the support,

4529
02:06:03.730 --> 02:06:03.850
uh,

4530
02:06:03.850 --> 02:06:07.470
the muscles that keep me from breaking form intact,

4531
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:09.060
I can regain strength,

4532
02:06:09.150 --> 02:06:09.690
uh,

4533
02:06:09.690 --> 02:06:10.501
get up to mind,

4534
02:06:10.501 --> 02:06:11.700
sort of former PR,

4535
02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:14.460
my personal record and strength in 48 weeks.

4536
02:06:14.461 --> 02:06:16.830
I mean it doesn't take a lot of time assuming I haven't lost a ton of muscle

4537
02:06:16.831 --> 02:06:17.370
mass.

4538
02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:18.203
Um,

4539
02:06:18.450 --> 02:06:18.871
but man,

4540
02:06:18.871 --> 02:06:20.010
you have to try this deadlift stuff.

4541
02:06:20.050 --> 02:06:21.270
It's really amazing.

4542
02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.650
It's a very interesting thing.

4543
02:06:22.651 --> 02:06:24.090
The muscle memory concept,

4544
02:06:24.091 --> 02:06:26.850
the fact that once someone has been large and strong,

4545
02:06:26.851 --> 02:06:28.620
they can get large and strong fairly quickly.

4546
02:06:28.621 --> 02:06:30.840
It's like the body remembers what it was like.

4547
02:06:31.890 --> 02:06:33.510
We were talking about mental performance.

4548
02:06:33.511 --> 02:06:33.980
Like if,

4549
02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:38.640
if someone does use visual consistently and that for instance,

4550
02:06:38.790 --> 02:06:41.310
facilitates some type of,

4551
02:06:41.311 --> 02:06:42.480
of neural patterning,

4552
02:06:43.140 --> 02:06:43.471
uh,

4553
02:06:43.471 --> 02:06:44.770
it sort of edges the groove.

4554
02:06:44.771 --> 02:06:49.350
So effectively for certain types of recall or for getting less reasoning,

4555
02:06:49.351 --> 02:06:51.870
thinking more or let's just say for,

4556
02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:52.920
uh,

4557
02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:53.340
for,

4558
02:06:53.340 --> 02:06:54.390
let's just say for,

4559
02:06:54.660 --> 02:06:57.360
I mean I would not use provisional consistently for six months,

4560
02:06:57.361 --> 02:07:01.590
but let's just say I did for six months and in those six months I studied in new

4561
02:07:01.591 --> 02:07:02.424
language.

4562
02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:04.920
So you pay Arabic fine,

4563
02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:05.970
like Levantine Arabic,

4564
02:07:05.971 --> 02:07:08.610
whatever or Bahasa Indonesian super regular.

4565
02:07:08.611 --> 02:07:11.070
So I should be able to get good at that pretty quickly or anybody should,

4566
02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:14.990
so I said an Indonesian for six months on provigil if I stop provisionals,

4567
02:07:14.991 --> 02:07:18.450
I mean I forget all my Indonesian now f of course not.

4568
02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:19.710
I don't think so.

4569
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:20.663
It's a good point.

4570
02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:24.960
So it's like you can lock in your gains and perhaps your little slower on

4571
02:07:24.961 --> 02:07:25.500
recall.

4572
02:07:25.500 --> 02:07:29.880
All I'm thinking about right now is provisional and Jujitsu and what a massive

4573
02:07:29.881 --> 02:07:31.260
combination that would be.

4574
02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:32.040
Yeah.

4575
02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:32.340
Yeah.

4576
02:07:32.340 --> 02:07:32.701
I mean,

4577
02:07:32.701 --> 02:07:33.534
um,

4578
02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:34.800
what was the benefit that the,

4579
02:07:34.801 --> 02:07:39.010
there's the sprinter received traumat faster reaction time,

4580
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:40.390
faster,

4581
02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.841
faster,

4582
02:07:40.841 --> 02:07:41.270
uh,

4583
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:42.100
take off speed,

4584
02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:42.820
basically.

4585
02:07:42.820 --> 02:07:43.061
Real.

4586
02:07:43.061 --> 02:07:43.421
And I mean,

4587
02:07:43.421 --> 02:07:44.021
that's why,

4588
02:07:44.021 --> 02:07:44.231
you know,

4589
02:07:44.231 --> 02:07:48.280
way back in the day when I was in the supplement world and fussing around mostly

4590
02:07:48.281 --> 02:07:49.240
with Acetylcholine,

4591
02:07:49.670 --> 02:07:50.503
uh,

4592
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.380
the objective was to optimize the neural system,

4593
02:07:53.410 --> 02:07:54.243
right.

4594
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:55.300
So that you can have,

4595
02:07:55.390 --> 02:07:56.290
have more,

4596
02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:57.221
more effective,

4597
02:07:57.221 --> 02:07:59.290
more powerful muscular contraction,

4598
02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:00.670
but also that you could react,

4599
02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:05.090
your reaction speed would be be improved and you can use all sorts of things for

4600
02:08:05.091 --> 02:08:05.261
that.

4601
02:08:05.261 --> 02:08:05.620
I think.

4602
02:08:05.620 --> 02:08:06.210
Yeah,

4603
02:08:06.210 --> 02:08:07.420
we did this ages ago.

4604
02:08:07.421 --> 02:08:08.620
This has some good stuff in it.

4605
02:08:08.770 --> 02:08:09.370
Uh,

4606
02:08:09.370 --> 02:08:10.203
with Alpha brain.

4607
02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:10.631
Yeah.

4608
02:08:10.631 --> 02:08:11.320
Alpha brain.

4609
02:08:11.320 --> 02:08:12.500
I find that my,

4610
02:08:13.100 --> 02:08:13.521
the other one,

4611
02:08:13.521 --> 02:08:17.100
not that I think alpha brain has been posting and some other goodies you go.

4612
02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:18.160
Yeah.

4613
02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:18.401
Uh,

4614
02:08:18.401 --> 02:08:23.020
but what I found out recently is the shit that I was tweaking around with an

4615
02:08:23.021 --> 02:08:25.290
experiment thing with in 99,

4616
02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:25.810
2000.

4617
02:08:25.810 --> 02:08:26.650
Even prior to that,

4618
02:08:26.651 --> 02:08:30.520
when I was doing it myself and like my own sort of chemistry lab in my dorm

4619
02:08:30.521 --> 02:08:30.701
room,

4620
02:08:30.701 --> 02:08:31.534
which I don't recommend

4621
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:35.110
the university frowns upon,

4622
02:08:35.111 --> 02:08:35.770
that,

4623
02:08:35.770 --> 02:08:36.603
uh,

4624
02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:38.890
is supposedly what,

4625
02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:39.370
uh,

4626
02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:43.600
some of the top Jamaican sprinters are toying with right now.

4627
02:08:43.601 --> 02:08:47.260
And that's Acetylcholine estrace and inhibition using things like galantamine or

4628
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:48.094
huperzine a,

4629
02:08:48.700 --> 02:08:49.390
uh,

4630
02:08:49.390 --> 02:08:51.100
to increase the,

4631
02:08:51.101 --> 02:08:51.460
uh,

4632
02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:54.640
basically inhibit the breakdown of Acetylcholine for muscular contraction.

4633
02:08:55.150 --> 02:08:56.950
And so like the,

4634
02:08:57.010 --> 02:08:57.840
the,

4635
02:08:57.840 --> 02:08:58.201
the,

4636
02:08:58.201 --> 02:09:02.560
the brute force hypertrophy approach to performance enhancement is one route,

4637
02:09:02.561 --> 02:09:03.191
but men,

4638
02:09:03.191 --> 02:09:07.040
they're getting clever with all sorts of stuff like fucking interleukin therapy.

4639
02:09:07.050 --> 02:09:08.080
It's crazy.

4640
02:09:08.081 --> 02:09:08.770
Crazy stuff.

4641
02:09:08.770 --> 02:09:10.060
What does Interleukin Therapy,

4642
02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:11.410
oh man,

4643
02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:11.651
God,

4644
02:09:11.651 --> 02:09:13.910
it's been so long since I just heard I can,

4645
02:09:13.911 --> 02:09:14.744
I mention names,

4646
02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:18.880
but you can probably guess interleukin.

4647
02:09:19.240 --> 02:09:23.080
Can we look up a definition for like interleukin six and because I'll,

4648
02:09:23.610 --> 02:09:24.443
yeah.

4649
02:09:24.630 --> 02:09:26.770
L E U K I n,

4650
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:28.263
uh,

4651
02:09:28.300 --> 02:09:30.940
or just interleukin six.

4652
02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:32.973
Yeah.

4653
02:09:33.210 --> 02:09:33.480
Oh,

4654
02:09:33.480 --> 02:09:35.100
Bacopa that's what I was messing around with.

4655
02:09:35.110 --> 02:09:37.630
Proinflammatory yeah.

4656
02:09:37.631 --> 02:09:41.740
So looking at how you can tool around with,

4657
02:09:42.180 --> 02:09:42.790
uh,

4658
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:43.660
inflammation,

4659
02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:46.030
how you can tool around with,

4660
02:09:46.240 --> 02:09:46.930
uh,

4661
02:09:46.930 --> 02:09:47.950
different types of,

4662
02:09:47.951 --> 02:09:50.190
let's say even if you're doing injury repair,

4663
02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.760
like bone morphogenic proteins,

4664
02:09:51.761 --> 02:09:52.541
there's some wacky,

4665
02:09:52.541 --> 02:09:52.871
wacky,

4666
02:09:52.871 --> 02:09:54.380
wacky shit that um,

4667
02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:56.290
some of the MMA fighters,

4668
02:09:56.410 --> 02:09:56.980
uh,

4669
02:09:56.980 --> 02:10:00.130
I don't want to mention anybody by name but have gone to let's say China for

4670
02:10:00.131 --> 02:10:01.630
experimental therapies that they're using.

4671
02:10:02.110 --> 02:10:02.860
Spinning.

4672
02:10:02.860 --> 02:10:03.250
Uh,

4673
02:10:03.250 --> 02:10:04.061
not the guy.

4674
02:10:04.061 --> 02:10:05.650
You're thinking which one?

4675
02:10:05.890 --> 02:10:06.723
Not over him.

4676
02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:07.481
No I didn't.

4677
02:10:07.481 --> 02:10:08.170
I wasn't thinking.

4678
02:10:08.170 --> 02:10:08.381
Oh,

4679
02:10:08.381 --> 02:10:08.840
okay.

4680
02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:09.673
I'm going to men,

4681
02:10:09.690 --> 02:10:10.750
men in days past.

4682
02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:12.100
Oh well yes,

4683
02:10:12.130 --> 02:10:13.060
these are older guys.

4684
02:10:13.210 --> 02:10:13.660
Um,

4685
02:10:13.660 --> 02:10:18.490
very big guys who put on like 40 additional pounds of mass in like two,

4686
02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:18.971
three months.

4687
02:10:18.971 --> 02:10:22.000
And these are guys who are already bigger as your heart deeper than they should

4688
02:10:22.001 --> 02:10:22.834
be

4689
02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:24.150
hot.

4690
02:10:24.150 --> 02:10:25.630
Not very well I think number one.

4691
02:10:25.631 --> 02:10:26.261
But number two,

4692
02:10:26.261 --> 02:10:29.920
your heart's growing too if you're using a bunch of non selective growth agents.

4693
02:10:30.340 --> 02:10:30.851
Do you know what I mean?

4694
02:10:30.851 --> 02:10:32.890
That's why like you go to the Mr Olympia,

4695
02:10:33.050 --> 02:10:33.411
you're like,

4696
02:10:33.411 --> 02:10:33.800
wow,

4697
02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:38.540
these are a bunch of like 300 pound muscular men who look like they're nine

4698
02:10:38.541 --> 02:10:39.140
months pregnant.

4699
02:10:39.140 --> 02:10:39.501
Why?

4700
02:10:39.501 --> 02:10:42.230
Because they're fucking intestines are as big around as a boa constrictor.

4701
02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:43.490
Oh my God.

4702
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:44.390
Isn't that gross?

4703
02:10:44.660 --> 02:10:46.040
I never even thought of that.

4704
02:10:46.041 --> 02:10:46.671
That's right.

4705
02:10:46.671 --> 02:10:47.620
You know what I'm talking about though?

4706
02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:49.790
Huge like pregnant belly.

4707
02:10:49.791 --> 02:10:50.061
You're like,

4708
02:10:50.061 --> 02:10:50.960
well what's going on here?

4709
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:52.460
Oh maybe I'm what it is.

4710
02:10:52.461 --> 02:10:54.500
Their organs grow visceral growth.

4711
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:55.663
That's real.

4712
02:10:55.700 --> 02:10:55.941
Yeah.

4713
02:10:55.941 --> 02:10:58.220
And here's just just for the kids at home who were like,

4714
02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:58.580
ah,

4715
02:10:58.580 --> 02:11:02.060
maybe I'll go order 15 first and make it some reason.

4716
02:11:02.061 --> 02:11:03.380
I thought that was just muscle.

4717
02:11:03.381 --> 02:11:06.650
Like they had like giant ab muscles called giant everything muscles.

4718
02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.371
They have giant everything.

4719
02:11:07.371 --> 02:11:07.911
Oregon's too.

4720
02:11:07.911 --> 02:11:10.790
So the how much they have to take to make your organs grow like that.

4721
02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:12.140
You know,

4722
02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:13.640
I think it's a very personal thing.

4723
02:11:13.641 --> 02:11:13.890
And,

4724
02:11:13.890 --> 02:11:15.860
and at the highest level athletics,

4725
02:11:15.861 --> 02:11:16.694
quite frankly,

4726
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:22.030
you have people who are very similarly mutants genetically speaking at the

4727
02:11:22.041 --> 02:11:22.551
highest level,

4728
02:11:22.551 --> 02:11:23.151
at the highest level.

4729
02:11:23.151 --> 02:11:27.980
I really like in cycling you have people with 25 beats per minute resting heart

4730
02:11:27.981 --> 02:11:28.191
rate.

4731
02:11:28.191 --> 02:11:29.390
I mean that's not normal.

4732
02:11:29.930 --> 02:11:33.950
And at that point I really believe that number one,

4733
02:11:33.951 --> 02:11:34.784
everyone's doping.

4734
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:35.623
Number two,

4735
02:11:35.630 --> 02:11:36.010
what?

4736
02:11:36.010 --> 02:11:40.040
Which differentiates the top performers from like third,

4737
02:11:40.041 --> 02:11:40.311
fourth,

4738
02:11:40.311 --> 02:11:40.760
fifth place.

4739
02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:42.710
Oftentimes it's their drug tolerance.

4740
02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:44.270
Like what can their liver clear,

4741
02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:45.170
how effectively.

4742
02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:45.920
Wow.

4743
02:11:45.920 --> 02:11:48.050
And uh,

4744
02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:50.020
so for a lot of these bodybuilders,

4745
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:51.950
they're just effectively immune,

4746
02:11:52.130 --> 02:11:52.731
not immune to,

4747
02:11:52.731 --> 02:11:56.930
but they suffer the side effects of certain drugs less than others.

4748
02:11:57.380 --> 02:11:58.580
And uh,

4749
02:11:59.300 --> 02:12:00.320
in terms of amount,

4750
02:12:00.321 --> 02:12:01.041
I mean she is,

4751
02:12:01.041 --> 02:12:02.450
some of these guys are doing like,

4752
02:12:03.510 --> 02:12:08.510
I feel like so many more I use of growth hormone in a day than any longevity

4753
02:12:10.521 --> 02:12:14.720
clinic would prescribe for a person like an 70 year old for a week.

4754
02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:16.190
And they're doing it on a daily basis.

4755
02:12:16.191 --> 02:12:18.810
Probably two x the recommended weekly though.

4756
02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:20.990
So what would that be like?

4757
02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:21.771
I'm just trying to think.

4758
02:12:21.771 --> 02:12:23.960
I mean 10 units a day,

4759
02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:24.591
at least.

4760
02:12:24.591 --> 02:12:25.424
At least 10.

4761
02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.020
At least 10 hours a day.

4762
02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:28.850
And they're combining that.

4763
02:12:28.851 --> 02:12:29.870
Keep in mind with,

4764
02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:30.200
uh,

4765
02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.610
things like insulin and whatnot.

4766
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:33.110
Not necessarily at the same time,

4767
02:12:33.550 --> 02:12:34.910
be very dangerous to take.

4768
02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:36.290
Insulin is very danger.

4769
02:12:36.291 --> 02:12:38.660
Insulin is like the heroine of performance enhancers,

4770
02:12:38.690 --> 02:12:39.231
you know what I mean?

4771
02:12:39.231 --> 02:12:40.880
It's like you can,

4772
02:12:40.940 --> 02:12:41.151
like,

4773
02:12:41.151 --> 02:12:42.140
you can try,

4774
02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:46.070
there are plenty of recreational drugs that won't fucking kill you.

4775
02:12:47.210 --> 02:12:48.043
Do you know what I mean?

4776
02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:49.430
And then it's like,

4777
02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:49.791
oh,

4778
02:12:49.791 --> 02:12:50.840
maybe I'll try heroin.

4779
02:12:50.841 --> 02:12:51.110
It's like,

4780
02:12:51.110 --> 02:12:51.241
no,

4781
02:12:51.241 --> 02:12:51.330
no,

4782
02:12:51.330 --> 02:12:51.650
no.

4783
02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:53.330
That idea for a whole host of reasons,

4784
02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:54.390
not the least of which is like,

4785
02:12:54.391 --> 02:12:55.460
if I can kill you right off the bat,

4786
02:12:55.461 --> 02:12:55.701
if you,

4787
02:12:55.701 --> 02:13:00.590
if you fuck up your math or just don't know the concentration and whatever the

4788
02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:01.540
with,

4789
02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:02.450
it's the same store.

4790
02:13:02.451 --> 02:13:02.901
If you,

4791
02:13:02.901 --> 02:13:03.590
if you're like,

4792
02:13:03.590 --> 02:13:03.801
oh,

4793
02:13:03.801 --> 02:13:07.670
I'm going to use long acting and you fuck up and you get fast acting injectable

4794
02:13:07.671 --> 02:13:09.940
insulin and then you use the wrong number of use.

4795
02:13:10.460 --> 02:13:10.791
Oh,

4796
02:13:10.791 --> 02:13:11.571
diabetic coma,

4797
02:13:11.571 --> 02:13:12.020
good night,

4798
02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:12.853
like you're done.

4799
02:13:13.240 --> 02:13:14.720
And it's the benefit of using it.

4800
02:13:14.830 --> 02:13:15.080
Uh,

4801
02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:16.400
it's a storage hormone.

4802
02:13:16.780 --> 02:13:18.170
So what that means is,

4803
02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:18.620
uh,

4804
02:13:18.620 --> 02:13:20.000
some power lifters,

4805
02:13:20.001 --> 02:13:20.391
for instance,

4806
02:13:20.391 --> 02:13:25.391
I know a lot of amazing power lifters and guys who were gay and guys gyms where

4807
02:13:30.081 --> 02:13:31.540
you walk in and the,

4808
02:13:31.541 --> 02:13:35.830
the kind of average is 700 800 pound squat,

4809
02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:36.370
right?

4810
02:13:36.370 --> 02:13:36.820
Right.

4811
02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:38.020
Those kinds of gyms.

4812
02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:38.530
A bill,

4813
02:13:38.530 --> 02:13:42.400
Bill inject insulin postworkout and then eat a big bowl of pasta.

4814
02:13:42.610 --> 02:13:42.911
This,

4815
02:13:42.911 --> 02:13:43.061
that,

4816
02:13:43.061 --> 02:13:43.850
the other thing,

4817
02:13:43.850 --> 02:13:44.683
and it will,

4818
02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:48.850
that's Glucose Glucagen glucose into the muscles.

4819
02:13:48.851 --> 02:13:49.631
Is that what the it'll,

4820
02:13:49.631 --> 02:13:50.320
it'll help.

4821
02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:50.730
Yeah.

4822
02:13:50.730 --> 02:13:51.460
I mean,

4823
02:13:51.460 --> 02:13:56.110
in effect it's going to also increase protein synthesis.

4824
02:13:56.111 --> 02:13:56.471
I'm on a,

4825
02:13:56.471 --> 02:13:57.304
among other things,

4826
02:13:57.850 --> 02:14:01.930
<v 1>so a big dose of carbohydrates after a workout and increases protein synthesis</v>

4827
02:14:02.110 --> 02:14:02.531
as well.

4828
02:14:02.531 --> 02:14:03.520
When you're the,

4829
02:14:03.521 --> 02:14:04.630
if you're taking insulin,

4830
02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:05.350
the insulin,

4831
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:07.630
I've never even met anybody who takes insulin.

4832
02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:08.920
Bodybuilders and power lifters,

4833
02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:10.270
that's all I got.

4834
02:14:10.271 --> 02:14:12.220
Athletes like I'm a mathletes are fighting

4835
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:14.580
<v 3>MMA guys would be doing it.</v>

4836
02:14:14.581 --> 02:14:15.900
It wouldn't surprise me.

4837
02:14:16.050 --> 02:14:18.300
Do you think someone could benefit if they did that before a fight?

4838
02:14:18.330 --> 02:14:19.800
Oh fuck.

4839
02:14:19.801 --> 02:14:20.700
I would never do that.

4840
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:21.211
I mean,

4841
02:14:21.211 --> 02:14:21.321
I,

4842
02:14:21.321 --> 02:14:24.000
I think that is really asking for trouble.

4843
02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:25.500
I know guys who've done EPO.

4844
02:14:25.740 --> 02:14:25.951
Oh,

4845
02:14:25.951 --> 02:14:26.700
for sure.

4846
02:14:26.700 --> 02:14:27.061
For sure.

4847
02:14:27.061 --> 02:14:27.500
Yeah.

4848
02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:27.880
I mean,

4849
02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:29.730
I've tested positive.

4850
02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:29.941
Oh,

4851
02:14:29.941 --> 02:14:30.211
sure.

4852
02:14:30.211 --> 02:14:33.690
A lot of the guys use EPO also don't realize if you're using an androgen,

4853
02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:37.410
so to stare when people say steroids are really talking about Anabolic

4854
02:14:37.411 --> 02:14:38.221
androgenic steroids,

4855
02:14:38.221 --> 02:14:38.460
right?

4856
02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:40.810
Ais is if you dare,

4857
02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:44.350
a lot of these compounds produce massive increases in,

4858
02:14:44.520 --> 02:14:46.200
in a red blood cell production.

4859
02:14:46.290 --> 02:14:48.660
So it's like you can get significant,

4860
02:14:48.661 --> 02:14:53.160
extremely pronounced endurance benefits from using drugs that are associated

4861
02:14:53.161 --> 02:14:54.150
primarily with size.

4862
02:14:54.450 --> 02:14:54.990
Really?

4863
02:14:54.990 --> 02:14:55.650
Oh yeah.

4864
02:14:55.650 --> 02:14:56.280
Which ones?

4865
02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:56.790
Oh yeah.

4866
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:57.660
Uh,

4867
02:14:58.590 --> 02:14:59.040
God,

4868
02:14:59.040 --> 02:14:59.700
you know,

4869
02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:00.390
all of them.

4870
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:01.170
I mean,

4871
02:15:01.170 --> 02:15:06.170
my understanding is that most a s are going to produce an increase in red blood

4872
02:15:07.741 --> 02:15:09.650
cell production and uh,

4873
02:15:09.780 --> 02:15:10.613
I'm blanking

4874
02:15:11.110 --> 02:15:13.120
<v 1>the recovery so mean that's,</v>

4875
02:15:13.150 --> 02:15:13.691
that makes sense.

4876
02:15:13.691 --> 02:15:17.170
Because apparently all the cyclists were all taking testosterone as well.

4877
02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:17.830
Oh yeah.

4878
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:19.690
They weren't just taking EPO.

4879
02:15:19.691 --> 02:15:19.991
They were,

4880
02:15:19.991 --> 02:15:21.250
they were also taking tests hops from him,

4881
02:15:21.251 --> 02:15:22.690
even though they were a little skinny guys.

4882
02:15:22.720 --> 02:15:26.290
They were still taking testosterone for the endurance benefit.

4883
02:15:26.430 --> 02:15:26.610
Ah.

4884
02:15:26.610 --> 02:15:28.040
Also recovery benefits recovery.

4885
02:15:28.250 --> 02:15:28.400
Like,

4886
02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:28.660
man,

4887
02:15:28.660 --> 02:15:29.470
you're getting multiple,

4888
02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:31.520
multiple stages on the treadmill.

4889
02:15:31.650 --> 02:15:36.490
It's something that a doctor wrote or he said that the Tour de France is so bad

4890
02:15:36.491 --> 02:15:38.060
on your body that it,

4891
02:15:38.300 --> 02:15:41.740
you could conceivably argue that it's healthier to do with drugs.

4892
02:15:42.050 --> 02:15:42.883
Hmm.

4893
02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:43.451
You said,

4894
02:15:43.451 --> 02:15:44.031
you can see,

4895
02:15:44.031 --> 02:15:47.280
it would be argued that if you're taking human growth hormone and testosterone

4896
02:15:47.290 --> 02:15:47.801
EPO,

4897
02:15:47.801 --> 02:15:51.340
it'd probably be safer on your body because your body could at least recover

4898
02:15:51.341 --> 02:15:54.490
from the brutal beating that you're giving it by making it work so hard.

4899
02:15:54.640 --> 02:15:55.270
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

4900
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.571
Yeah.

4901
02:15:55.571 --> 02:15:57.310
I mean I wouldn't dismiss that out of it.

4902
02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:58.140
It seems,

4903
02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:00.190
it seems like a reasonable argument.

4904
02:16:01.360 --> 02:16:01.631
My,

4905
02:16:01.631 --> 02:16:02.380
I mean my,

4906
02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:04.600
my fantasy solution to all this,

4907
02:16:04.601 --> 02:16:06.940
the doping outrage,

4908
02:16:06.941 --> 02:16:07.930
which is just kind of,

4909
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:11.980
it's amusing to me because it's existed since the first Olympiad and well before

4910
02:16:11.981 --> 02:16:12.221
that,

4911
02:16:12.221 --> 02:16:15.920
I mean people were taking mushrooms and fucking be eating bull testicles and all

4912
02:16:15.921 --> 02:16:16.030
that.

4913
02:16:16.030 --> 02:16:16.331
Yeah,

4914
02:16:16.331 --> 02:16:17.164
I mean it's,

4915
02:16:17.320 --> 02:16:18.050
it's been around

4916
02:16:18.050 --> 02:16:18.883
<v 1>wine,</v>

4917
02:16:18.980 --> 02:16:19.731
the Tour de France,

4918
02:16:19.731 --> 02:16:21.320
the list of things they used to tay,

4919
02:16:21.690 --> 02:16:23.340
he used to take strychnine of,

4920
02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:24.560
I don't know.

4921
02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:25.910
I mean it might not even work.

4922
02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:26.830
It's just like there were just like,

4923
02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:27.231
fuck it,

4924
02:16:27.231 --> 02:16:28.160
let's cheat zoo.

4925
02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:29.390
Let's try it once.

4926
02:16:29.391 --> 02:16:30.350
Try Rat poison.

4927
02:16:30.810 --> 02:16:31.100
<v 3>What?</v>

4928
02:16:31.100 --> 02:16:33.090
I would love to see my dick off it.

4929
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:34.250
What I would love to see.

4930
02:16:34.590 --> 02:16:37.640
Then you'd need extremely precise instrumentation for this,

4931
02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:40.010
which I don't think at this point is practical.

4932
02:16:40.011 --> 02:16:40.950
But if,

4933
02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:42.320
if you were to test,

4934
02:16:42.380 --> 02:16:47.380
say the top hundred competitors and determine for any blood marker that's

4935
02:16:48.411 --> 02:16:49.850
associated with performance,

4936
02:16:50.060 --> 02:16:52.570
who sets the high watermark?

4937
02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:53.413
So in other words,

4938
02:16:53.450 --> 02:16:55.010
nobody's going to have the same testosterone.

4939
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:56.023
So it's like,

4940
02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:59.780
it's not possible that everyone has the same testosterone and free testosterone,

4941
02:16:59.781 --> 02:17:00.500
et cetera.

4942
02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:02.840
So let's identify a handful of things like free,

4943
02:17:02.900 --> 02:17:05.450
let's just say t three free free thyroid.

4944
02:17:05.700 --> 02:17:06.320
Um,

4945
02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:08.630
then you have free testosterone and uh,

4946
02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:09.171
you know,

4947
02:17:09.171 --> 02:17:11.600
you could look at proxies for growth hormone and blah,

4948
02:17:11.601 --> 02:17:11.721
blah,

4949
02:17:11.721 --> 02:17:11.980
blah,

4950
02:17:11.980 --> 02:17:12.590
blah.

4951
02:17:12.590 --> 02:17:12.830
You're like,

4952
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:13.160
okay,

4953
02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:16.600
everybody else can dope up to this high watermark and not beyond it if you want,

4954
02:17:16.610 --> 02:17:18.380
if you want it to try to level the playing field,

4955
02:17:19.010 --> 02:17:21.410
that might be extensively how you'd go about doing it.

4956
02:17:21.890 --> 02:17:22.161
I mean,

4957
02:17:22.161 --> 02:17:23.750
obviously that's more of a thought exercise.

4958
02:17:23.751 --> 02:17:25.490
We'd never had them would never expect it to happen.

4959
02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:28.340
But it's like the idea that,

4960
02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:33.770
I mean there are people out there who produce testosterone that would be in

4961
02:17:33.771 --> 02:17:36.980
excess of what I could achieve with low to low dose testosterone if I were to

4962
02:17:36.981 --> 02:17:37.970
inject it right then of course.

4963
02:17:38.180 --> 02:17:38.490
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

4964
02:17:38.490 --> 02:17:39.080
it is.

4965
02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:43.400
There's no even playing field when it comes to athletics.

4966
02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:43.790
Yeah.

4967
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:44.623
There's just not,

4968
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:45.051
you know,

4969
02:17:45.051 --> 02:17:47.060
certain people will have a different bone structure.

4970
02:17:47.061 --> 02:17:47.751
Certain people,

4971
02:17:47.751 --> 02:17:52.160
like John Jones has a massive research reach advantage over almost everyone he

4972
02:17:52.161 --> 02:17:52.580
fights.

4973
02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:56.210
Are we going to cut people's limbs and stretch them out until they're Jon Jones

4974
02:17:56.211 --> 02:17:57.560
is a size to make it even.

4975
02:17:57.590 --> 02:17:58.610
Cause if it's not,

4976
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:59.750
then it's not even.

4977
02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:00.370
Yeah.

4978
02:18:00.370 --> 02:18:00.850
Yeah.

4979
02:18:00.850 --> 02:18:01.281
You know,

4980
02:18:01.281 --> 02:18:02.300
a guy like,

4981
02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:02.600
you know,

4982
02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:03.351
certain guys,

4983
02:18:03.351 --> 02:18:05.870
I don't know how much you follow the history of MMA,

4984
02:18:05.871 --> 02:18:09.110
but there's certain guys that just had a massive advantage or how about

4985
02:18:09.111 --> 02:18:09.441
wrestling?

4986
02:18:09.441 --> 02:18:10.820
How about Alexander Chlorella?

4987
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:11.330
<v 3>I thought,</v>

4988
02:18:11.330 --> 02:18:12.410
oh fuck.

4989
02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:14.450
Graylin is amazing.

4990
02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:16.070
You can't overcome that.

4991
02:18:16.250 --> 02:18:17.350
You're never going to overcome that.

4992
02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:19.160
For those people who don't know who this is.

4993
02:18:19.161 --> 02:18:19.340
Yeah.

4994
02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:22.610
Alexandria or Alexander Karelian Greco was seven,

4995
02:18:22.611 --> 02:18:22.881
six,

4996
02:18:22.881 --> 02:18:25.550
seven time world champion Greco Roman wrestler.

4997
02:18:25.640 --> 02:18:26.473
Uh,

4998
02:18:26.510 --> 02:18:26.931
and,

4999
02:18:26.931 --> 02:18:27.140
uh,

5000
02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:30.290
I remember having a poster in high school when I was wrestling and one of his

5001
02:18:30.291 --> 02:18:30.770
quotes was,

5002
02:18:30.770 --> 02:18:32.390
I train harder every day,

5003
02:18:32.391 --> 02:18:33.890
then you will ever trained in your life.

5004
02:18:34.350 --> 02:18:37.580
And then there was a photograph of him doing his reverse body lift and he was

5005
02:18:37.581 --> 02:18:39.110
famous for this is the guy,

5006
02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:40.280
you guys have to look this guy up.

5007
02:18:40.640 --> 02:18:42.020
He talked about them in the pot.

5008
02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:43.730
Oh,

5009
02:18:43.730 --> 02:18:44.563
absolutely.

5010
02:18:44.630 --> 02:18:46.790
When he was being interviewed by a journalist at one point,

5011
02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:47.480
they're like,

5012
02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:48.260
aren't you muscle?

5013
02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:51.500
Like don't you get muscle bound to get with building your muscles the way that

5014
02:18:51.501 --> 02:18:51.740
you,

5015
02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:52.573
that you have?

5016
02:18:52.670 --> 02:18:55.670
And he lifted his foot up and touched a chandelier over his head and he's like,

5017
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.971
no,

5018
02:18:55.971 --> 02:18:56.804
not really.

5019
02:18:56.930 --> 02:18:57.763
He stretches.

5020
02:18:58.050 --> 02:18:58.391
Yeah,

5021
02:18:58.391 --> 02:18:58.610
yeah.

5022
02:18:58.610 --> 02:19:01.230
<v 0>That they trained that guy the right way.</v>

5023
02:19:01.410 --> 02:19:03.900
They used to call him to experiment because,

5024
02:19:03.901 --> 02:19:04.290
uh,

5025
02:19:04.290 --> 02:19:04.770
they,

5026
02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:05.603
they had,

5027
02:19:05.610 --> 02:19:05.941
you know,

5028
02:19:05.941 --> 02:19:07.850
he had tiny Fallon a family.

5029
02:19:07.940 --> 02:19:09.330
His parents were small.

5030
02:19:09.390 --> 02:19:09.750
Yeah.

5031
02:19:09.750 --> 02:19:10.430
It's parents white.

5032
02:19:10.430 --> 02:19:10.741
Five,

5033
02:19:10.741 --> 02:19:11.191
seven,

5034
02:19:11.191 --> 02:19:11.491
five,

5035
02:19:11.491 --> 02:19:12.324
eight.

5036
02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:12.541
Yeah.

5037
02:19:12.541 --> 02:19:14.250
I think his dad was five or seven or something like that.

5038
02:19:14.251 --> 02:19:14.930
And with Moms,

5039
02:19:14.930 --> 02:19:15.270
I,

5040
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.780
you know what,

5041
02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:17.100
it might have been smaller than that.

5042
02:19:17.370 --> 02:19:17.860
Wow.

5043
02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:19.570
And for folks who don't know how big he was,

5044
02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:20.910
I think he was six,

5045
02:19:20.911 --> 02:19:21.361
four,

5046
02:19:21.361 --> 02:19:21.661
six,

5047
02:19:21.661 --> 02:19:22.141
five,

5048
02:19:22.141 --> 02:19:24.360
300 pounds and move like a cat.

5049
02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:28.220
He was the most ridiculous athletic specimen that I'd ever seen.

5050
02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:33.460
<v 1>But the reality of that era of the Soviet Union is you got to assume that they</v>

5051
02:19:33.741 --> 02:19:35.120
had that guy on everything,

5052
02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:35.900
on demand.

5053
02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:40.130
The fact that they had women that looked like men in the eastern block,

5054
02:19:40.131 --> 02:19:40.820
women,

5055
02:19:40.820 --> 02:19:44.120
we had victor content on the podcast who said that those women's set records

5056
02:19:44.121 --> 02:19:46.520
that to this day are unattainable in women.

5057
02:19:46.670 --> 02:19:47.450
Yeah.

5058
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:47.631
Oh,

5059
02:19:47.631 --> 02:19:48.470
I'm totally played it.

5060
02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:49.071
That was the,

5061
02:19:49.071 --> 02:19:49.601
that was the,

5062
02:19:49.601 --> 02:19:52.850
the golden era of drugs.

5063
02:19:53.490 --> 02:19:54.021
It was like,

5064
02:19:54.021 --> 02:19:54.854
what in the 80s?

5065
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.550
Uh,

5066
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:56.570
probably earlier as well.

5067
02:19:56.571 --> 02:19:56.961
But I mean,

5068
02:19:56.961 --> 02:20:00.020
you look at some of like the female basketball players from the Soviet Union

5069
02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:03.680
during the Cold War and it's just like they meant these,

5070
02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:05.900
these shelves of bone.

5071
02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:06.740
Yeah.

5072
02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:08.360
Like acromegaly from Growth Pharma.

5073
02:20:08.390 --> 02:20:08.601
Well,

5074
02:20:08.601 --> 02:20:09.291
not only that,

5075
02:20:09.291 --> 02:20:10.850
they have that man face,

5076
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.570
you know,

5077
02:20:11.570 --> 02:20:13.130
there's a face that a man has.

5078
02:20:13.131 --> 02:20:14.450
Like if I put you in a dress,

5079
02:20:14.480 --> 02:20:15.120
okay.

5080
02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:16.850
And I put lipstick on you and I'm like,

5081
02:20:16.851 --> 02:20:18.380
that motherfucker has on man face.

5082
02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:20.600
I don't know what it is,

5083
02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:24.050
what it is about a man's face that is just different.

5084
02:20:24.051 --> 02:20:26.510
But there's a weird thing that happens to these women.

5085
02:20:26.540 --> 02:20:27.370
I thought you were hitting on me from,

5086
02:20:27.370 --> 02:20:28.203
I don't know.

5087
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:30.200
How dare you put you in a dress.

5088
02:20:30.370 --> 02:20:32.420
If I wanted to have sex with a man,

5089
02:20:32.421 --> 02:20:33.610
I would want a man and literally on man.

5090
02:20:33.620 --> 02:20:34.280
God Damn it.

5091
02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:35.150
You just take it.

5092
02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:36.261
Just take it apart.

5093
02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:37.940
Anti Parkinson's drug and be done with it.

5094
02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:38.391
Yeah.

5095
02:20:38.391 --> 02:20:41.060
I would just fucking get on some reequipped and get the party started.

5096
02:20:41.450 --> 02:20:42.283
Um,

5097
02:20:42.290 --> 02:20:42.770
there's,

5098
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:43.460
there's a,

5099
02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:43.730
I don't know,

5100
02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:45.800
it's a really hard to tell thing.

5101
02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:46.041
I mean,

5102
02:20:46.041 --> 02:20:47.390
it's a hard to describe thing.

5103
02:20:47.540 --> 02:20:51.590
Like how do you describe subtlety of sarcasm to someone who doesn't understand

5104
02:20:51.591 --> 02:20:52.170
language?

5105
02:20:52.170 --> 02:20:52.360
Right.

5106
02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:52.490
Well,

5107
02:20:52.490 --> 02:20:57.380
there's a subtlety to a face that is a man face and I don't know what it is.

5108
02:20:57.380 --> 02:20:59.690
It's like a little leaner than it should be.

5109
02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:00.673
Like a little,

5110
02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:01.930
little more taut.

5111
02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:05.900
The jaw muscles seem a little bigger than they should be.

5112
02:21:05.930 --> 02:21:06.500
Yeah.

5113
02:21:06.500 --> 02:21:08.540
There's a little bit more intensity to you.

5114
02:21:08.600 --> 02:21:10.340
What is that a man face that you're pulling up?

5115
02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:10.620
Yeah.

5116
02:21:10.620 --> 02:21:14.090
That chick from peewee's big adventure scene of a man face.

5117
02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:15.750
I need to look up a by email.

5118
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:16.623
Who Man,

5119
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:17.360
no,

5120
02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:18.760
that's a sprinter.

5121
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:19.130
Who is,

5122
02:21:19.130 --> 02:21:24.130
I guess Hermaphrodite who was recently stripped of her metals in what she was,

5123
02:21:24.891 --> 02:21:26.030
she exonerated.

5124
02:21:26.031 --> 02:21:27.530
I do not remember the story.

5125
02:21:27.531 --> 02:21:30.500
I think that they thought that she was a man and then they actually,

5126
02:21:30.770 --> 02:21:35.770
they actually exonerated her when they subjected her to some really humiliating

5127
02:21:35.931 --> 02:21:37.430
tests and found out she's just,

5128
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.941
you know,

5129
02:21:37.941 --> 02:21:38.930
there's a spectrum.

5130
02:21:38.931 --> 02:21:41.000
We've all met fame men who are,

5131
02:21:41.001 --> 02:21:41.451
you know,

5132
02:21:41.451 --> 02:21:45.290
a week and look like they barely produce any testosterone at all.

5133
02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:46.880
I don't know why that is.

5134
02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:50.210
And then you'll meet a Samoan guy who doesn't even lift weights and he's got

5135
02:21:50.211 --> 02:21:50.691
calves,

5136
02:21:50.691 --> 02:21:54.140
like somebody cut him open and stuffed up basketball each of his fucking legs.

5137
02:21:54.590 --> 02:21:55.700
It doesn't make any sense.

5138
02:21:55.760 --> 02:21:56.061
You know,

5139
02:21:56.061 --> 02:21:56.661
there's the,

5140
02:21:56.661 --> 02:21:59.030
the human body is very variable.

5141
02:21:59.570 --> 02:22:00.560
So I think,

5142
02:22:00.561 --> 02:22:01.394
um,

5143
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.700
the idea of a level playing field as we were talking about.

5144
02:22:04.701 --> 02:22:04.870
Yeah.

5145
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:05.290
It's just,

5146
02:22:05.290 --> 02:22:06.320
it's preposterous.

5147
02:22:06.321 --> 02:22:08.040
There's no level playing and just have to do,

5148
02:22:08.210 --> 02:22:13.210
do the most with whatever you are equipped with or wait for science to turn you

5149
02:22:13.281 --> 02:22:14.114
into the hulk.

5150
02:22:14.410 --> 02:22:15.243
Cause yeah,

5151
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:18.650
cause that to me seems like it's inevitable.

5152
02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:23.680
I look at the idea of performance enhancing drugs is always going to exist.

5153
02:22:24.320 --> 02:22:24.681
Okay.

5154
02:22:24.681 --> 02:22:26.070
The of being

5155
02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:26.881
<v 0>able to take something,</v>

5156
02:22:26.881 --> 02:22:29.190
it makes you better and like all things,

5157
02:22:29.191 --> 02:22:30.390
it's going to progress.

5158
02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:33.840
Like your laptop's computer power processing power,

5159
02:22:33.841 --> 02:22:35.370
the processing power of your phone,

5160
02:22:35.550 --> 02:22:37.050
the download speeds of your Internet.

5161
02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:38.430
All that stuff's going to keep going.

5162
02:22:38.610 --> 02:22:40.890
So if it's going to keep going in the athletic department,

5163
02:22:40.891 --> 02:22:41.221
you got to go,

5164
02:22:41.221 --> 02:22:41.431
okay,

5165
02:22:41.431 --> 02:22:42.390
well where's it going to go?

5166
02:22:42.450 --> 02:22:43.283
Cause it's not,

5167
02:22:43.470 --> 02:22:43.800
it's,

5168
02:22:43.800 --> 02:22:44.281
it's gonna.

5169
02:22:44.281 --> 02:22:46.020
It's not gonna stop where it's at,

5170
02:22:46.021 --> 02:22:46.590
where you get,

5171
02:22:46.590 --> 02:22:47.423
you know,

5172
02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:48.400
you know,

5173
02:22:48.400 --> 02:22:49.233
fill in the blank.

5174
02:22:49.300 --> 02:22:50.140
Super Athlete.

5175
02:22:50.141 --> 02:22:50.950
Michael Johnson,

5176
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:51.940
is that the graph from the Oh no it was,

5177
02:22:51.941 --> 02:22:53.380
it got Ben Johnson and Johnson.

5178
02:22:53.650 --> 02:22:54.610
It's not going to stop there.

5179
02:22:54.670 --> 02:22:55.540
Obviously it didn't.

5180
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:58.780
And by the way they say that when he was stripped of his gold medal,

5181
02:22:58.900 --> 02:23:00.010
Carl Lewis was doping.

5182
02:23:00.450 --> 02:23:00.850
<v 3>He was,</v>

5183
02:23:00.850 --> 02:23:03.390
he tested positive for at least to a band stimulant.

5184
02:23:03.410 --> 02:23:03.930
Yeah.

5185
02:23:03.930 --> 02:23:04.291
And,

5186
02:23:04.291 --> 02:23:04.380
uh,

5187
02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:08.640
that's when the HIA crafty doctors and lawyers at work,

5188
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:09.540
uh,

5189
02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:14.130
went about creating this inadvertent use explanation.

5190
02:23:15.450 --> 02:23:16.500
Herbal tea.

5191
02:23:16.501 --> 02:23:17.640
I had a cold,

5192
02:23:17.940 --> 02:23:19.890
that's why I tested positive for ephedrine.

5193
02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:21.590
But uh,

5194
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:24.571
have you seen bigger,

5195
02:23:24.571 --> 02:23:24.931
faster,

5196
02:23:24.931 --> 02:23:25.460
stronger?

5197
02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:26.020
Yeah.

5198
02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:26.880
I haven't seen the whole thing.

5199
02:23:26.881 --> 02:23:28.010
I shut it off halfway through.

5200
02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:28.390
Okay.

5201
02:23:28.390 --> 02:23:28.591
No,

5202
02:23:28.591 --> 02:23:30.240
because they interview Carlos,

5203
02:23:30.270 --> 02:23:31.560
but then they also interview,

5204
02:23:31.770 --> 02:23:32.370
uh,

5205
02:23:32.370 --> 02:23:33.151
people from,

5206
02:23:33.151 --> 02:23:37.230
I believe it was the International Olympic Committee anti-doping,

5207
02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:38.690
uh,

5208
02:23:38.690 --> 02:23:41.040
antidoping coalition or whatever the name of it was.

5209
02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:42.170
Who,

5210
02:23:42.170 --> 02:23:43.003
uh,

5211
02:23:43.970 --> 02:23:44.711
who did,

5212
02:23:44.711 --> 02:23:45.501
they didn't forge,

5213
02:23:45.501 --> 02:23:45.990
but they,

5214
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.823
uh,

5215
02:23:48.240 --> 02:23:48.470
eh,

5216
02:23:48.470 --> 02:23:49.130
they,

5217
02:23:49.130 --> 02:23:51.440
they exonerated athletes who tested positive,

5218
02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:56.770
who were a PR assets to the United States by effect removing documentation.

5219
02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:57.741
Well,

5220
02:23:57.741 --> 02:23:59.660
that's essentially what they did with Lance Armstrong,

5221
02:24:00.140 --> 02:24:00.321
right?

5222
02:24:00.321 --> 02:24:00.570
Yeah,

5223
02:24:00.570 --> 02:24:00.951
sure.

5224
02:24:00.951 --> 02:24:01.251
I mean,

5225
02:24:01.251 --> 02:24:01.550
it's,

5226
02:24:01.550 --> 02:24:01.911
it's,

5227
02:24:01.911 --> 02:24:02.090
uh,

5228
02:24:02.090 --> 02:24:02.930
Ben Johnson,

5229
02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:04.461
Ben Johnson.

5230
02:24:04.461 --> 02:24:05.061
It's too bad.

5231
02:24:05.061 --> 02:24:06.500
Like with Ben Johnson for instance.

5232
02:24:06.620 --> 02:24:07.453
Um,

5233
02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:08.600
like as far as I'm concerned,

5234
02:24:08.601 --> 02:24:08.810
look,

5235
02:24:08.810 --> 02:24:09.680
if you're going to play a sport,

5236
02:24:09.710 --> 02:24:10.520
you break the rules,

5237
02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:12.200
you get disqualified and the story.

5238
02:24:12.290 --> 02:24:14.300
But he was,

5239
02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:15.193
he,

5240
02:24:15.290 --> 02:24:17.720
he tested positive for a drug that he was not using.

5241
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:19.310
He was using it different anabolic,

5242
02:24:19.970 --> 02:24:20.810
a number one.

5243
02:24:20.811 --> 02:24:23.120
Number two was,

5244
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:23.840
uh,

5245
02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:28.840
his training by Charlie Francis was absolutely state of the art.

5246
02:24:29.810 --> 02:24:30.321
So there's a,

5247
02:24:30.321 --> 02:24:31.600
there's a book if I think you have to eat,

5248
02:24:31.640 --> 02:24:33.890
I don't really think you could find you have to buy for like 170 bucks,

5249
02:24:33.891 --> 02:24:37.550
but it's called a training for speed by Charlie Francis.

5250
02:24:37.580 --> 02:24:39.620
That is a gold mine.

5251
02:24:39.920 --> 02:24:41.330
Really incredible.

5252
02:24:41.430 --> 02:24:41.930
Yeah,

5253
02:24:41.930 --> 02:24:42.651
just incredible.

5254
02:24:42.651 --> 02:24:42.831
I mean,

5255
02:24:42.831 --> 02:24:44.090
this guy was decades ahead.

5256
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:45.080
Uh,

5257
02:24:45.080 --> 02:24:45.751
in terms of his,

5258
02:24:45.751 --> 02:24:46.940
his training protocols,

5259
02:24:47.480 --> 02:24:47.931
really,

5260
02:24:47.931 --> 02:24:50.200
really outstanding from a personal,

5261
02:24:50.201 --> 02:24:51.230
for a personal question,

5262
02:24:51.320 --> 02:24:56.320
what do you know about bulging discs and healing back injuries and dealing with

5263
02:24:56.961 --> 02:24:57.794
back injuries?

5264
02:24:58.070 --> 02:24:58.671
I don't know.

5265
02:24:58.671 --> 02:25:01.250
I don't know much about bulging desks.

5266
02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:02.140
Um,

5267
02:25:02.140 --> 02:25:02.410
I,

5268
02:25:02.410 --> 02:25:04.250
I do know that,

5269
02:25:05.090 --> 02:25:05.923
<v 10>uh,</v>

5270
02:25:06.240 --> 02:25:06.631
<v 3>I've had,</v>

5271
02:25:06.631 --> 02:25:08.490
I've just recently fixed some,

5272
02:25:08.580 --> 02:25:09.413
some pretty,

5273
02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:10.313
uh,

5274
02:25:11.460 --> 02:25:14.670
pretty fucking painful back issues.

5275
02:25:15.450 --> 02:25:16.240
And,

5276
02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:16.490
uh,

5277
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:21.240
I realized after doing a lot of PT and going to some very high end,

5278
02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:21.780
uh,

5279
02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:26.780
sports therapist that my lower traps for instance on my left side weren't firing

5280
02:25:27.641 --> 02:25:30.460
properly from a bunch of old injuries and a host of other,

5281
02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:30.970
uh,

5282
02:25:30.970 --> 02:25:32.140
for a host of other reasons.

5283
02:25:32.470 --> 02:25:36.650
And it turned out I tried a number of ways to fix this and x,

5284
02:25:36.651 --> 02:25:38.740
there's causing a lot of mid back pain and whatnot.

5285
02:25:39.940 --> 02:25:40.600
And it,

5286
02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:41.130
uh,

5287
02:25:41.130 --> 02:25:41.350
it,

5288
02:25:41.350 --> 02:25:43.210
I came to realize that I,

5289
02:25:43.211 --> 02:25:46.690
it wasn't enough to just do like activation exercises where I retracted,

5290
02:25:46.691 --> 02:25:48.700
depress the Scapula and raise my arm and whatnot.

5291
02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:52.180
I actually had to fix pack.

5292
02:25:52.780 --> 02:25:53.613
Uh,

5293
02:25:53.770 --> 02:25:58.420
I had to increase my pec mobility and open up my chest because of so much time

5294
02:25:58.421 --> 02:25:59.770
sitting down at a computer.

5295
02:26:00.130 --> 02:26:04.960
I had to use a Lacrosse ball to do mobility work on my pecks and then just like

5296
02:26:04.961 --> 02:26:05.794
that,

5297
02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:06.341
my,

5298
02:26:06.341 --> 02:26:06.640
uh,

5299
02:26:06.640 --> 02:26:09.940
my lower traps are firing properly again and now my back stabilized.

5300
02:26:09.941 --> 02:26:11.140
I can do kettlebell swings properly.

5301
02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:12.310
Uh,

5302
02:26:12.310 --> 02:26:13.000
pretty wild.

5303
02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.140
Have you ever been robbed?

5304
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:15.783
I have,

5305
02:26:15.790 --> 02:26:16.510
yeah.

5306
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:17.440
That's quite feeling.

5307
02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:21.550
That's supposed to sort of be the whole concept behind the Roth Roth things.

5308
02:26:21.551 --> 02:26:22.271
Very helpful.

5309
02:26:22.271 --> 02:26:23.020
I also,

5310
02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:23.380
uh,

5311
02:26:23.380 --> 02:26:28.380
have had some very good results with art active release technique Graston which

5312
02:26:29.081 --> 02:26:32.020
is where they use implements to effectively help with,

5313
02:26:32.050 --> 02:26:33.760
it's like raw fin with metal objects,

5314
02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:35.950
with fundamental objects.

5315
02:26:35.951 --> 02:26:36.190
Yeah.

5316
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:37.023
Battle ropes.

5317
02:26:37.300 --> 02:26:39.990
That'll respite and they put you on a bad heart first,

5318
02:26:40.500 --> 02:26:41.333
uh,

5319
02:26:41.950 --> 02:26:43.660
for very good results with that bulging discs.

5320
02:26:43.661 --> 02:26:45.500
I don't know enough about to really go on.

5321
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:47.170
<v 0>Well right now I've been,</v>

5322
02:26:47.210 --> 02:26:51.990
rolfing has been helping me alleviate a lot of the feeling of the,

5323
02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:56.000
the tension in the muscles around the backwards tighten up Jujitsu injury,

5324
02:26:56.060 --> 02:26:59.060
reoccurring injury that the lucky thing is that it's bulging,

5325
02:26:59.061 --> 02:26:59.990
it's on herniated,

5326
02:27:00.020 --> 02:27:00.860
and apparently there's,

5327
02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:04.010
there they have good success and trying to fix that.

5328
02:27:04.490 --> 02:27:07.550
I wanted to know if you knew anything about a spinal decompression cause that's

5329
02:27:08.180 --> 02:27:09.110
one of the things that people have been,

5330
02:27:09.140 --> 02:27:10.430
a lot of people have been suggesting.

5331
02:27:10.431 --> 02:27:10.960
There's a lot of it

5332
02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:12.430
<v 3>different using what technique?</v>

5333
02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:13.563
Um,

5334
02:27:13.840 --> 02:27:15.010
I forget the name of the machine,

5335
02:27:15.090 --> 02:27:19.770
<v 0>but there's a couple of different in this one state of the art one VRX 9,000,</v>

5336
02:27:19.771 --> 02:27:20.250
I want to say,

5337
02:27:20.250 --> 02:27:21.083
hold on.

5338
02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:22.483
Spying.

5339
02:27:24.230 --> 02:27:25.063
Um,

5340
02:27:25.110 --> 02:27:26.370
there's a place in Beverly Hills.

5341
02:27:26.371 --> 02:27:26.970
It does it.

5342
02:27:26.970 --> 02:27:27.301
Yeah.

5343
02:27:27.301 --> 02:27:31.740
Drx 9,000 spinal decompression and uh,

5344
02:27:31.880 --> 02:27:36.880
it's like polls and relaxes and poles and relaxes and does so in a way that the,

5345
02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:38.160
um,

5346
02:27:38.160 --> 02:27:38.740
uh,

5347
02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:39.030
it,

5348
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.271
it,

5349
02:27:39.271 --> 02:27:44.220
it does it in a varying way where the muscles don't resist it or it's like,

5350
02:27:44.221 --> 02:27:47.790
I guess regular if feel like hanging upside down by your ankles,

5351
02:27:48.190 --> 02:27:52.170
your muscle musculature would tighten up when it really won't be much separation

5352
02:27:52.171 --> 02:27:52.980
at all.

5353
02:27:52.980 --> 02:27:55.190
But this does it in a way where it,

5354
02:27:55.250 --> 02:28:00.250
it pulls and relaxes multiple times within a second so that it confuses the body

5355
02:28:00.661 --> 02:28:02.280
enough so that it doesn't react to it.

5356
02:28:02.490 --> 02:28:05.370
And it allows to slowly separate the,

5357
02:28:05.371 --> 02:28:05.491
uh,

5358
02:28:05.491 --> 02:28:07.440
the injured area and allows the,

5359
02:28:07.441 --> 02:28:11.340
a compressed disk to a relax and go back.

5360
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:12.663
<v 3>Not sure.</v>

5361
02:28:12.760 --> 02:28:13.511
Let me know how it goes.

5362
02:28:13.511 --> 02:28:17.980
I mean I'd be interested in what I found very helpful for trying to work on

5363
02:28:17.981 --> 02:28:22.981
let's say thoracic or upper back issues is trying to address the,

5364
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:27.350
or trying to identify if there are problems lower down.

5365
02:28:27.410 --> 02:28:29.270
I like the lumbar and the hip level first.

5366
02:28:29.620 --> 02:28:30.381
So for instance,

5367
02:28:30.381 --> 02:28:32.610
there's a device you can get,

5368
02:28:32.611 --> 02:28:33.560
it's a little quirky,

5369
02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:38.760
the exercises rather odd looking but it's called the supine groin progressive

5370
02:28:40.430 --> 02:28:41.300
and uh,

5371
02:28:42.470 --> 02:28:43.020
the,

5372
02:28:43.020 --> 02:28:43.870
it's an Nga,

5373
02:28:43.900 --> 02:28:45.470
you exercise Eg,

5374
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.921
O,

5375
02:28:45.921 --> 02:28:46.340
s,

5376
02:28:46.340 --> 02:28:46.761
c,

5377
02:28:46.761 --> 02:28:51.761
u e and there's this thing that looks like a tower and you put a boot on

5378
02:28:52.041 --> 02:28:56.090
effectively that locks your foot in place and you just extend it and you,

5379
02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:56.380
you,

5380
02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:58.540
you increase or decrease the elevation and,

5381
02:28:58.541 --> 02:29:01.250
and you have one leg in this thing for like 20,

5382
02:29:01.251 --> 02:29:04.190
25 minutes at a time and it,

5383
02:29:04.270 --> 02:29:05.210
you position your,

5384
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:06.830
your other leg at a right angle.

5385
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:07.580
Anyway,

5386
02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:09.050
the point being it eat,

5387
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:10.611
it causes,

5388
02:29:10.611 --> 02:29:11.810
at least in me,

5389
02:29:11.811 --> 02:29:14.360
it really helped to relax more than anything else.

5390
02:29:14.361 --> 02:29:18.440
Extremely tight hip flexors from sitting down for extended periods of time,

5391
02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:20.630
which then alleviated the lower back pain.

5392
02:29:20.631 --> 02:29:25.631
And then I found a lot of the upstream pains and aches that I had were

5393
02:29:25.760 --> 02:29:27.410
apparently referral from lower down.

5394
02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:32.360
And that's an issue with Jujitsu guys where you get back pain from tight

5395
02:29:32.361 --> 02:29:33.140
hamstrings.

5396
02:29:33.140 --> 02:29:33.450
Yup.

5397
02:29:33.450 --> 02:29:35.270
Very common that you're,

5398
02:29:35.271 --> 02:29:37.340
you as your hamstrings tighten up your back.

5399
02:29:37.341 --> 02:29:39.170
We'll sorta like resist and you'll,

5400
02:29:39.171 --> 02:29:40.940
you'll start getting like cramps and areas

5401
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:42.850
<v 0>that might've even initially been where,</v>

5402
02:29:42.851 --> 02:29:43.610
why I haven't

5403
02:29:43.610 --> 02:29:44.870
<v 3>my issue in the first place.</v>

5404
02:29:44.930 --> 02:29:45.260
Yeah.

5405
02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:45.411
Well,

5406
02:29:45.411 --> 02:29:50.411
I mean I remember way back in the day I went to the same doctors that worked on

5407
02:29:50.570 --> 02:29:50.870
uh,

5408
02:29:50.870 --> 02:29:55.870
Bj Penn and they said you didn't do it when you do so much guard work.

5409
02:29:56.120 --> 02:29:56.271
ACC,

5410
02:29:56.271 --> 02:29:56.691
he had,

5411
02:29:56.691 --> 02:29:59.630
they said his hip flexors are like the hip flexors of a fucking camel.

5412
02:29:59.631 --> 02:30:01.120
They were like as big around as,

5413
02:30:01.430 --> 02:30:01.650
you know,

5414
02:30:01.650 --> 02:30:02.690
normal person's quad.

5415
02:30:02.691 --> 02:30:04.790
Like his hip flexors are just ridiculous.

5416
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:09.590
And so we had all this debilitating back pain and they focused on art primarily.

5417
02:30:09.591 --> 02:30:10.071
But it's like,

5418
02:30:10.071 --> 02:30:10.520
yeah,

5419
02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:13.310
I mean if you look at the damage it can be done through sitting.

5420
02:30:13.311 --> 02:30:13.581
It's like,

5421
02:30:13.581 --> 02:30:13.820
well,

5422
02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:17.180
if you're doing a lot of guard work like man,

5423
02:30:17.181 --> 02:30:19.190
are you shortly near your hip flexors?

5424
02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:19.761
Yeah,

5425
02:30:19.761 --> 02:30:24.080
guard guys a lot of times of like serious lower back problems and Eddie Bravo so

5426
02:30:24.090 --> 02:30:26.660
had some pretty extensive lower back problems.

5427
02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:31.960
He's really interesting because he subscribes to that John Sarno ideology that

5428
02:30:33.450 --> 02:30:36.170
you didn't know Sarno was a idea is that it's all in your head?

5429
02:30:36.620 --> 02:30:36.981
Yeah.

5430
02:30:36.981 --> 02:30:37.610
Is a,

5431
02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:39.530
what is it like back pain free?

5432
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:42.680
I know I've seen so I've read at least one of his books.

5433
02:30:42.810 --> 02:30:43.670
What's your take on it?

5434
02:30:46.880 --> 02:30:47.450
I don't,

5435
02:30:47.450 --> 02:30:49.820
I think there are many cases where it's in your head.

5436
02:30:49.850 --> 02:30:52.580
I think there are also a hell of a lot of cases where there's a structural

5437
02:30:52.581 --> 02:30:53.090
problem.

5438
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:53.750
Yeah,

5439
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:54.530
I agree.

5440
02:30:54.530 --> 02:30:54.921
I agree.

5441
02:30:54.921 --> 02:30:54.950
Yeah,

5442
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:55.630
100%

5443
02:30:55.630 --> 02:30:58.150
<v 0>I I find that book to be a little insulting.</v>

5444
02:30:58.610 --> 02:31:02.350
The idea like you know that he's seen all these different backs that have been

5445
02:31:02.351 --> 02:31:04.510
all fucked up and the people haven't been any pain at all.

5446
02:31:04.511 --> 02:31:05.060
I'm like,

5447
02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:06.250
what are they doing though?

5448
02:31:06.280 --> 02:31:06.641
Are they,

5449
02:31:06.641 --> 02:31:07.750
are they sprinting?

5450
02:31:07.751 --> 02:31:10.990
Are they throwing kettle bells around or are they just like living life and not

5451
02:31:10.991 --> 02:31:13.030
moving at all because it's not the case.

5452
02:31:13.031 --> 02:31:13.211
Yeah.

5453
02:31:13.211 --> 02:31:14.800
You might not be in back pain,

5454
02:31:15.040 --> 02:31:19.320
but if you have a structural issue and you try to use your body and know you

5455
02:31:19.321 --> 02:31:20.460
have a herniated disc,

5456
02:31:20.760 --> 02:31:22.410
you can't fucking tell me that's in your head.

5457
02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:23.340
That's craziness.

5458
02:31:23.370 --> 02:31:23.990
Yeah.

5459
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:26.760
<v 3>There I think there are a few things.</v>

5460
02:31:26.761 --> 02:31:29.700
I would say that I think that using his method,

5461
02:31:29.701 --> 02:31:34.701
you could effectively self hypnotize and block out pain that is due to a

5462
02:31:35.881 --> 02:31:36.511
structural problem,

5463
02:31:36.511 --> 02:31:38.430
but that doesn't fix the structural issue.

5464
02:31:38.850 --> 02:31:39.510
Right.

5465
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:41.550
So I do think that exasperate,

5466
02:31:41.860 --> 02:31:42.340
yeah.

5467
02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:42.510
Yeah.

5468
02:31:42.510 --> 02:31:45.780
Could be exacerbated by the fact that you have a real problem.

5469
02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:46.171
Right.

5470
02:31:46.171 --> 02:31:48.030
So just having looked at,

5471
02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:49.980
and I'm sure you've had plenty of injuries too,

5472
02:31:49.981 --> 02:31:51.600
but it's like after

5473
02:31:54.250 --> 02:31:56.430
a decade of wrestling and a bunch of judo and this,

5474
02:31:56.431 --> 02:31:58.980
that and the other thing and accumulating injuries and fixing those injuries,

5475
02:31:58.981 --> 02:32:02.580
like there are points at which you have structural problems that need fixing.

5476
02:32:04.020 --> 02:32:04.531
And,

5477
02:32:04.531 --> 02:32:05.364
uh,

5478
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:06.503
and um,

5479
02:32:06.820 --> 02:32:07.130
yeah,

5480
02:32:07.130 --> 02:32:08.630
I think that's pretty much the end of the,

5481
02:32:08.650 --> 02:32:11.400
the coil or the beginning of the story is not necessarily the end of the story,

5482
02:32:11.490 --> 02:32:15.150
<v 0>but it's fascinating how many people subscribe to it and how many people say</v>

5483
02:32:15.151 --> 02:32:15.731
that it's changed in,

5484
02:32:15.731 --> 02:32:16.920
in life and actually help them.

5485
02:32:16.921 --> 02:32:17.131
It's,

5486
02:32:17.131 --> 02:32:17.970
it's really interesting.

5487
02:32:17.971 --> 02:32:19.020
I don't think they're lying.

5488
02:32:19.130 --> 02:32:19.350
No.

5489
02:32:19.350 --> 02:32:21.510
So it's like what was their pain based on?

5490
02:32:21.570 --> 02:32:21.960
Is it okay?

5491
02:32:21.960 --> 02:32:22.590
<v 3>I do.</v>

5492
02:32:22.590 --> 02:32:27.540
I do think you also could have a structural pain that you then become so

5493
02:32:27.541 --> 02:32:32.310
accustomed to reacting to that you have trouble functioning without envisioning

5494
02:32:32.311 --> 02:32:33.420
that pain in some fashion.

5495
02:32:33.450 --> 02:32:34.080
Does that make sense?

5496
02:32:34.080 --> 02:32:34.320
Yes,

5497
02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:34.820
it does.

5498
02:32:34.820 --> 02:32:36.660
And I think in those instances,

5499
02:32:36.661 --> 02:32:37.494
which I think are,

5500
02:32:37.530 --> 02:32:39.060
are probably quite common,

5501
02:32:39.390 --> 02:32:43.140
then his approach would be absolutely appropriate and would have a huge impact.

5502
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:44.990
But it's like you can't tell me,

5503
02:32:44.991 --> 02:32:48.210
it's like if somebody has a triangle and gets picked up off the ground and,

5504
02:32:48.370 --> 02:32:51.990
and the guy tries to do a fucking front flip and slams the guy on his upper back

5505
02:32:51.991 --> 02:32:55.650
and his neck that he's just going to meditate is way to feeling better.

5506
02:32:55.651 --> 02:32:55.891
It's like,

5507
02:32:55.891 --> 02:32:56.370
no,

5508
02:32:56.370 --> 02:32:57.630
like you need to get back guys,

5509
02:32:57.700 --> 02:32:58.380
Mris,

5510
02:32:58.380 --> 02:33:01.530
you need to get some x rays and I don't think sign would disagree with that.

5511
02:33:01.531 --> 02:33:02.410
But it's like there are,

5512
02:33:02.411 --> 02:33:06.360
there are times that you just need like real interventions whether that's

5513
02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:10.830
nutritional or therapeutic or manual manipulation.

5514
02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:11.821
Yeah,

5515
02:33:11.821 --> 02:33:12.960
I completely agree.

5516
02:33:12.961 --> 02:33:15.480
But I do find it fascinating how many people swear by it.

5517
02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:15.741
It's,

5518
02:33:15.741 --> 02:33:16.111
it's a,

5519
02:33:16.111 --> 02:33:17.040
it's an amazing thing.

5520
02:33:17.041 --> 02:33:19.980
I mean it was sent to me because I was having back pain and a buddy of mine is

5521
02:33:19.981 --> 02:33:20.401
like this is,

5522
02:33:20.401 --> 02:33:21.121
this is what fixed me.

5523
02:33:21.121 --> 02:33:21.850
And he sent it over there.

5524
02:33:21.850 --> 02:33:24.400
<v 0>Well the issue also is like why the back?</v>

5525
02:33:24.460 --> 02:33:25.510
Why not knees?

5526
02:33:25.511 --> 02:33:26.440
Why not elbows?

5527
02:33:26.441 --> 02:33:30.460
How come it's only in the back and the how w w why did people believe that they

5528
02:33:30.461 --> 02:33:32.770
store tension in their back?

5529
02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:33.750
Like what is that about?

5530
02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:37.170
It's all sitting then think so what it is think cynics terrible for him.

5531
02:33:37.270 --> 02:33:38.103
I think it ended well.

5532
02:33:38.230 --> 02:33:38.800
Yeah,

5533
02:33:38.800 --> 02:33:39.311
I think it is.

5534
02:33:39.311 --> 02:33:40.270
Well we just,

5535
02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:43.690
I get tired from sitting but I don't get tired like were saying about the

5536
02:33:43.691 --> 02:33:44.231
hunting thing.

5537
02:33:44.231 --> 02:33:45.810
Walking around on top of mountains everyday.

5538
02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:46.713
You don't need an APP.

5539
02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:47.350
Yeah,

5540
02:33:47.350 --> 02:33:47.720
yeah.

5541
02:33:47.720 --> 02:33:47.840
No,

5542
02:33:47.840 --> 02:33:47.950
no,

5543
02:33:47.950 --> 02:33:48.783
not at all.

5544
02:33:48.820 --> 02:33:49.810
We're not designed for this.

5545
02:33:49.811 --> 02:33:50.920
This is a weird activity.

5546
02:33:50.921 --> 02:33:53.830
Just be sitting still and then get our food just comes to us.

5547
02:33:54.010 --> 02:33:54.880
We're going to leave here,

5548
02:33:54.881 --> 02:33:57.750
we're going to go get some steak with Sam Harris and Kayla.

5549
02:33:57.790 --> 02:33:58.630
We're not killing anything,

5550
02:33:58.631 --> 02:33:58.841
dude.

5551
02:33:58.841 --> 02:33:59.680
We're just sitting down.

5552
02:33:59.860 --> 02:34:00.730
It's already killed.

5553
02:34:00.760 --> 02:34:01.690
They waited a while,

5554
02:34:01.691 --> 02:34:03.820
they aged it and then they're going to cook it right in front of,

5555
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:05.950
we don't have to do shit's give him a little piece of plastic.

5556
02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:07.053
Boom.

5557
02:34:07.180 --> 02:34:08.013
And they bring us in meat.

5558
02:34:08.390 --> 02:34:09.030
<v 3>I told my,</v>

5559
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:10.280
I told my girlfriend because,

5560
02:34:10.281 --> 02:34:11.090
uh,

5561
02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:11.540
I get,

5562
02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:13.790
I get stuck in my head quite a lot because I'm always like,

5563
02:34:13.791 --> 02:34:15.290
I can logic my way out of this.

5564
02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:16.190
Like there's gotta be like,

5565
02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:17.350
if something's bothering me,

5566
02:34:17.470 --> 02:34:18.970
it's cause I'm looking at it the wrong way.

5567
02:34:18.971 --> 02:34:20.650
Or like I'm not doing the right thought exercise.

5568
02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:21.120
Like I can,

5569
02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:21.230
blah,

5570
02:34:21.230 --> 02:34:21.371
blah,

5571
02:34:21.371 --> 02:34:21.521
blah,

5572
02:34:21.521 --> 02:34:21.691
blah,

5573
02:34:21.691 --> 02:34:21.881
blah.

5574
02:34:21.881 --> 02:34:26.860
And it gets so hyper intellectual about problems that are,

5575
02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:29.320
have far simpler solutions typically,

5576
02:34:29.350 --> 02:34:30.071
or not typically,

5577
02:34:30.071 --> 02:34:30.881
but very often.

5578
02:34:30.881 --> 02:34:32.650
So I remember at one point I was just fucking,

5579
02:34:32.880 --> 02:34:33.420
Oh shit,

5580
02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:35.920
I'm fucking angry about some bullshit that I had to deal with.

5581
02:34:35.921 --> 02:34:37.000
Like maybe it was Barnes and noble,

5582
02:34:37.001 --> 02:34:38.680
something rather some fucking who knows?

5583
02:34:39.460 --> 02:34:41.500
And so I was trying to like meditate my way out of it and I was like,

5584
02:34:41.501 --> 02:34:42.334
you know what?

5585
02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:44.320
I need to go to the fucking gym and lift some heavy stuff.

5586
02:34:44.350 --> 02:34:46.480
And so I just left and like did some dead lifts.

5587
02:34:46.490 --> 02:34:49.930
I came back and I just said whenever I'm like trying to figure out stuff by

5588
02:34:49.931 --> 02:34:51.940
reading like Krishnamurthy or whatever,

5589
02:34:51.941 --> 02:34:52.930
which has its place,

5590
02:34:52.931 --> 02:34:56.830
but like send me to the gym first because nine times out of 10 I'll come back

5591
02:34:56.831 --> 02:34:57.430
and I'll be fine.

5592
02:34:57.430 --> 02:34:59.140
Action has its place as well.

5593
02:34:59.390 --> 02:34:59.850
Yeah,

5594
02:34:59.850 --> 02:35:00.860
<v 0>it's very important.</v>

5595
02:35:01.320 --> 02:35:02.220
Intellectuals,

5596
02:35:02.221 --> 02:35:04.740
oftentimes we'll ignore that aspect of the body.

5597
02:35:04.741 --> 02:35:05.990
Mind to an action.

5598
02:35:06.010 --> 02:35:06.330
Yeah.

5599
02:35:06.330 --> 02:35:07.740
I think it's a real disservice.

5600
02:35:07.741 --> 02:35:09.560
They really fucked themselves over by,

5601
02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:10.620
you know,

5602
02:35:10.620 --> 02:35:11.820
whatever it is,

5603
02:35:11.880 --> 02:35:13.470
an association with Jocks,

5604
02:35:13.471 --> 02:35:13.641
you know,

5605
02:35:13.641 --> 02:35:18.240
whatever it is in their head that makes them not hesitant to commit to training

5606
02:35:18.241 --> 02:35:18.871
and exercise.

5607
02:35:18.871 --> 02:35:19.291
But God,

5608
02:35:19.291 --> 02:35:19.830
it's such a,

5609
02:35:19.830 --> 02:35:21.630
you're doing yourself a disservice.

5610
02:35:21.750 --> 02:35:22.980
I had lunch with the,

5611
02:35:23.220 --> 02:35:23.640
<v 3>uh,</v>

5612
02:35:23.640 --> 02:35:24.680
I think she's the president.

5613
02:35:24.750 --> 02:35:25.583
Um,

5614
02:35:25.700 --> 02:35:28.490
or one of the heads of the Michael J.

5615
02:35:28.490 --> 02:35:33.490
Fox foundation focused on Parkinson's research and drug development and they

5616
02:35:33.561 --> 02:35:37.340
have some fantastic scientists involved and we got into this long conversation

5617
02:35:37.341 --> 02:35:40.820
about Parkinson's and Alzheimer's in different types of neuro degenerative

5618
02:35:40.821 --> 02:35:44.720
disease because I have Parkinson's and Alzheimer's on both sides of my family.

5619
02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:46.100
So yeah.

5620
02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:46.690
And like I said,

5621
02:35:46.690 --> 02:35:48.170
we equipped son get in there.

5622
02:35:48.740 --> 02:35:49.700
Don't be scared

5623
02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:55.910
to have my friends ready to intervene up to have some like bouncers from the

5624
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:56.061
Jerry Springer show.

5625
02:35:56.061 --> 02:35:58.290
Those guys in the black shirts keep an eye on me.

5626
02:35:59.570 --> 02:36:00.830
They might take advantage of me though.

5627
02:36:01.130 --> 02:36:01.963
They might

5628
02:36:03.110 --> 02:36:04.700
give you the double up your dosage,

5629
02:36:06.010 --> 02:36:06.591
but the,

5630
02:36:06.591 --> 02:36:07.460
the point I was going to make,

5631
02:36:07.461 --> 02:36:07.690
I said,

5632
02:36:07.690 --> 02:36:09.050
I asked her of all the,

5633
02:36:09.230 --> 02:36:10.490
all the prospective drugs,

5634
02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:12.020
all of the potential interventions,

5635
02:36:12.021 --> 02:36:12.854
let's say,

5636
02:36:14.180 --> 02:36:17.230
I do think I wasn't kidding about creating and coconut oils,

5637
02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:18.500
medium chain triglycerides,

5638
02:36:18.530 --> 02:36:22.280
pretty interesting applications to staving off things like Alzheimer's and

5639
02:36:22.281 --> 02:36:23.114
Parkinson's.

5640
02:36:23.390 --> 02:36:25.440
And that's not just like bullshit anecdote.

5641
02:36:25.441 --> 02:36:27.020
Like it's actually been some decent research,

5642
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:28.190
uh,

5643
02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:28.791
applied to it,

5644
02:36:28.791 --> 02:36:32.930
but she said exercise exercise number one

5645
02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:34.330
<v 0>totally makes sense.</v>

5646
02:36:34.340 --> 02:36:35.173
Yeah,

5647
02:36:35.320 --> 02:36:35.831
for sure.

5648
02:36:35.831 --> 02:36:39.160
It has a massive effect on my mood and my self esteem,

5649
02:36:39.161 --> 02:36:39.670
my,

5650
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:40.990
my perception of the world,

5651
02:36:40.991 --> 02:36:42.130
my tolerance for people.

5652
02:36:42.131 --> 02:36:42.720
Everything.

5653
02:36:42.720 --> 02:36:43.110
Yeah.

5654
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:44.140
It's gotta be good for you.

5655
02:36:45.180 --> 02:36:50.170
You fucks get out there and exercise at the end of this long and beautiful

5656
02:36:50.171 --> 02:36:52.720
podcast about really important issues.

5657
02:36:52.721 --> 02:36:54.520
It's really all about do calisthenics,

5658
02:36:54.940 --> 02:36:56.650
get some chin ups and you'll look at life better.

5659
02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:57.873
It's true.

5660
02:36:57.910 --> 02:37:00.100
Do some high rep squats against some perspective.

5661
02:37:00.190 --> 02:37:00.640
Yeah.

5662
02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:02.020
Do a hundred body weight squats.

5663
02:37:02.050 --> 02:37:02.883
Just a hundred.

5664
02:37:03.370 --> 02:37:04.203
You know,

5665
02:37:04.450 --> 02:37:07.300
Karl gotch used to make people do 500 bodyweight squats.

5666
02:37:07.330 --> 02:37:08.320
Gotchas base.

5667
02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:08.710
Yeah.

5668
02:37:08.710 --> 02:37:10.390
He's to have you,

5669
02:37:10.391 --> 02:37:14.650
you'd have to go through like some crazy rigorous thing for like over a year

5670
02:37:14.651 --> 02:37:16.250
before he would even show you wrestling.

5671
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:16.581
<v 3>Louis,</v>

5672
02:37:16.581 --> 02:37:18.220
you'd have to get yourself in shape first.

5673
02:37:18.250 --> 02:37:18.530
Sorry.

5674
02:37:18.530 --> 02:37:19.720
Japanese about the whole thing.

5675
02:37:19.940 --> 02:37:20.211
Yeah.

5676
02:37:20.211 --> 02:37:20.920
Is that what it is?

5677
02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:23.720
It's the Japanese ideology and they fell in love with him.

5678
02:37:23.780 --> 02:37:24.201
Yeah.

5679
02:37:24.201 --> 02:37:24.471
Man.

5680
02:37:24.471 --> 02:37:28.130
When I was in Japan 92 they had all sorts of profiles of him.

5681
02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:28.820
Oh really?

5682
02:37:28.820 --> 02:37:29.500
Very much.

5683
02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:29.750
Like,

5684
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:30.111
okay,

5685
02:37:30.111 --> 02:37:31.010
you want to make Sushi?

5686
02:37:31.011 --> 02:37:31.521
Great.

5687
02:37:31.521 --> 02:37:32.630
You're going to learn how to,

5688
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:35.180
how to steam rice for 10 years,

5689
02:37:35.210 --> 02:37:37.130
and then I'm going to let you touch your first fish.

5690
02:37:37.131 --> 02:37:37.341
You know,

5691
02:37:37.341 --> 02:37:39.560
it's very like pay your dues.

5692
02:37:39.561 --> 02:37:41.000
Have you seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi?

5693
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.330
No,

5694
02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:42.560
I heard it's amazing.

5695
02:37:42.770 --> 02:37:43.250
Oh Man.

5696
02:37:43.250 --> 02:37:45.290
You were like the seventh person on Netflix.

5697
02:37:45.350 --> 02:37:47.720
It is as it or I'm going to watch it tonight.

5698
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:48.860
I went to Japan,

5699
02:37:49.150 --> 02:37:49.983
uh,

5700
02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.770
and had Sushi with his son after seeing that movie because I wanted to check out

5701
02:37:54.771 --> 02:37:57.020
exactly how they made it a for the four hour chef.

5702
02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:59.450
And I was looking also at sort of longevity questions.

5703
02:37:59.451 --> 02:38:00.284
So I went to,

5704
02:38:01.050 --> 02:38:01.440
okay,

5705
02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:04.190
now into the village where they have the average,

5706
02:38:04.310 --> 02:38:06.470
the longest average lifespan in the world.

5707
02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:07.011
Oh me.

5708
02:38:07.011 --> 02:38:10.130
It's in the middle of nowhere to try to look at like their diet,

5709
02:38:10.131 --> 02:38:10.641
what they did,

5710
02:38:10.641 --> 02:38:11.271
how they behaved,

5711
02:38:11.271 --> 02:38:12.104
et Cetera.

5712
02:38:12.290 --> 02:38:14.660
I think one of the advantages I have is there a lot of people who have looked

5713
02:38:14.661 --> 02:38:15.200
into that.

5714
02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:15.741
Number one,

5715
02:38:15.741 --> 02:38:17.420
going with a confirmation bias that they're like,

5716
02:38:17.421 --> 02:38:17.691
all right,

5717
02:38:17.691 --> 02:38:21.770
these people are vegetarians and they come in with a thesis they want to prove

5718
02:38:22.430 --> 02:38:25.460
as accurate and there were a couple of really fascinating thanks.

5719
02:38:25.461 --> 02:38:26.280
Number one.

5720
02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:26.510
Uh,

5721
02:38:26.510 --> 02:38:31.460
right off the bat I noticed that you could look at the things they do that other

5722
02:38:31.461 --> 02:38:32.001
people don't do it.

5723
02:38:32.001 --> 02:38:33.980
So they drink fermented turmeric tea for instance.

5724
02:38:34.040 --> 02:38:34.341
Very,

5725
02:38:34.341 --> 02:38:34.940
very common.

5726
02:38:34.940 --> 02:38:35.870
Who knows if that's the,

5727
02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:37.700
that's the culprit or the cause.

5728
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:39.320
It's probably a combination of factors,

5729
02:38:39.321 --> 02:38:43.160
but one of the things was we very rarely got rice with our meals.

5730
02:38:43.310 --> 02:38:45.130
Traditional looking now and meals.

5731
02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:46.160
We've got sweet potatoes,

5732
02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:47.890
very low price,

5733
02:38:48.650 --> 02:38:51.650
and they actually had a lot of pork and pork fat for instance.

5734
02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:55.310
But the perhaps the most important thing that I took away from this,

5735
02:38:56.210 --> 02:38:57.560
almost nobody retires.

5736
02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:01.940
Our driver was 85 and he had more energy than all of us combined and he's like,

5737
02:39:01.941 --> 02:39:02.091
yeah,

5738
02:39:02.091 --> 02:39:02.541
let me show you.

5739
02:39:02.541 --> 02:39:02.871
I'll get out,

5740
02:39:02.871 --> 02:39:03.261
I'll walk out.

5741
02:39:03.261 --> 02:39:03.741
I'll show you around.

5742
02:39:03.741 --> 02:39:04.730
Like everybody was,

5743
02:39:04.940 --> 02:39:06.020
they had a purpose.

5744
02:39:06.021 --> 02:39:07.460
They still had some type of purpose.

5745
02:39:07.461 --> 02:39:12.030
Even if that was just like tending the fields of irises on the outskirts of Ogi

5746
02:39:12.031 --> 02:39:14.870
me or whatever it was like they are out and about doing things.

5747
02:39:15.470 --> 02:39:16.303
Um,

5748
02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:16.691
<v 1>yeah.</v>

5749
02:39:16.691 --> 02:39:20.230
It just stands to reason that if the body doesn't get exercise,

5750
02:39:20.231 --> 02:39:21.041
it atrophies.

5751
02:39:21.041 --> 02:39:22.330
If the muscles don't get exercise,

5752
02:39:22.331 --> 02:39:23.360
they shrank the,

5753
02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:25.900
if the mind doesn't get any stimulation,

5754
02:39:25.901 --> 02:39:26.920
it becomes dull.

5755
02:39:26.950 --> 02:39:28.170
It's like it just you,

5756
02:39:28.171 --> 02:39:29.890
you got to use it or it goes away.

5757
02:39:30.130 --> 02:39:30.521
It's really,

5758
02:39:30.521 --> 02:39:33.580
you don't own it for very long and the only way it works right is if you have

5759
02:39:33.581 --> 02:39:36.730
fucking put the pedal to the medal and keep that bitch hot.

5760
02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:38.020
Stress the organism,

5761
02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:39.610
stress the organism people.

5762
02:39:39.640 --> 02:39:41.210
But the Jiro dreams of Sushi,

5763
02:39:41.211 --> 02:39:41.500
you'll,

5764
02:39:41.500 --> 02:39:42.760
I think you'll really enjoy it.

5765
02:39:42.910 --> 02:39:44.890
I have to see this is,

5766
02:39:45.580 --> 02:39:45.791
yeah,

5767
02:39:45.791 --> 02:39:48.850
we got to wrap this up because this is for real.

5768
02:39:48.851 --> 02:39:49.181
This is,

5769
02:39:49.181 --> 02:39:50.290
you're the seventh person,

5770
02:39:50.291 --> 02:39:55.291
I think in this past week that's this brought up that movie seven again.

5771
02:39:56.050 --> 02:39:56.660
That was an accident.

5772
02:39:56.660 --> 02:39:56.931
Actually.

5773
02:39:56.931 --> 02:39:57.790
I just slipped right out.

5774
02:39:58.480 --> 02:39:59.650
It might even be hyperbole.

5775
02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:02.710
It might've been five and I said seven because it'd been hypnotized.

5776
02:40:03.730 --> 02:40:04.870
<v 3>What are your favorite movies?</v>

5777
02:40:04.871 --> 02:40:05.531
I know we've got to wrap,

5778
02:40:05.531 --> 02:40:06.490
but I'm very curious.

5779
02:40:06.700 --> 02:40:07.630
I favorite movies,

5780
02:40:08.180 --> 02:40:09.090
documentaries or,

5781
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.480
or,

5782
02:40:09.480 --> 02:40:10.270
or let's,

5783
02:40:10.270 --> 02:40:10.491
uh,

5784
02:40:10.491 --> 02:40:10.690
if,

5785
02:40:10.690 --> 02:40:10.900
if,

5786
02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:11.770
if they come to mind,

5787
02:40:11.771 --> 02:40:13.030
I'd love to know documentaries.

5788
02:40:14.480 --> 02:40:15.260
<v 0>Grizzly man.</v>

5789
02:40:15.260 --> 02:40:18.500
That's one of my favorite because I love the unintentional comedy.

5790
02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:21.590
I think grizzly man is one of the perfect movies.

5791
02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:22.493
That's Werner Herzog.

5792
02:40:22.510 --> 02:40:22.830
Yeah.

5793
02:40:22.830 --> 02:40:27.290
Werner Herzog's movie about a guy who was gay who didn't want to be gay,

5794
02:40:27.291 --> 02:40:28.460
so he lived with bears.

5795
02:40:28.490 --> 02:40:28.671
I mean,

5796
02:40:28.671 --> 02:40:29.510
that's how I take it.

5797
02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:31.100
And then he quite a gnarly ending too.

5798
02:40:31.160 --> 02:40:31.611
Yeah.

5799
02:40:31.611 --> 02:40:32.660
Suicide by bear.

5800
02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:36.280
It's a hundreds and hundreds of hours this guy took.

5801
02:40:36.300 --> 02:40:38.480
If you haven't seen the grizzly man,

5802
02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:39.051
it's a must.

5803
02:40:39.051 --> 02:40:39.800
See,

5804
02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:43.280
it's really one of my all time favorite movies and it's hilarious if you see it

5805
02:40:43.340 --> 02:40:44.960
with the right person under the right.

5806
02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:46.340
Herbs and supplements,

5807
02:40:46.990 --> 02:40:48.470
I think Glaucoma medication,

5808
02:40:48.471 --> 02:40:48.920
Aisha.

5809
02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:49.461
Yeah,

5810
02:40:49.461 --> 02:40:50.450
exactly that too.

5811
02:40:50.740 --> 02:40:52.220
It's fucking tremendous.

5812
02:40:52.221 --> 02:40:52.520
It's a,

5813
02:40:52.520 --> 02:40:53.780
it's probably one of my,

5814
02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:54.310
cause I,

5815
02:40:54.310 --> 02:40:56.810
it has everything to it as nature and animals,

5816
02:40:56.811 --> 02:40:57.950
which I'm absolutely obsessed with.

5817
02:40:57.951 --> 02:40:59.480
Scary fucking grizzly bears.

5818
02:40:59.481 --> 02:41:00.000
It's why your,

5819
02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.200
your episode of meeting here.

5820
02:41:01.250 --> 02:41:01.810
Oh fuck.

5821
02:41:01.810 --> 02:41:02.840
It was horrifying.

5822
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:03.480
She's he,

5823
02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:04.640
you haven't seen it Brian?

5824
02:41:04.641 --> 02:41:06.200
He was out there with a fucking,

5825
02:41:06.290 --> 02:41:06.780
they had,

5826
02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:07.730
they killed a Caribou,

5827
02:41:07.731 --> 02:41:08.180
which is,

5828
02:41:08.180 --> 02:41:08.451
okay,

5829
02:41:08.451 --> 02:41:10.920
so you've got like 400 pounds of meat sitting there.

5830
02:41:10.980 --> 02:41:11.420
Yeah.

5831
02:41:11.420 --> 02:41:13.880
And a grizzly bear rand into your camp.

5832
02:41:13.881 --> 02:41:14.960
He was a running towards

5833
02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:15.321
<v 3>the key,</v>

5834
02:41:15.321 --> 02:41:19.760
had three separate grizzly encounters with the grizzlies coming into our camps.

5835
02:41:20.120 --> 02:41:20.740
<v 0>All right.</v>

5836
02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:21.573
Ooh.

5837
02:41:21.630 --> 02:41:22.860
How dangerous is that?

5838
02:41:22.861 --> 02:41:23.970
Is it really dangerous,

5839
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.140
sort of dangerous?

5840
02:41:25.570 --> 02:41:26.403
<v 3>I they,</v>

5841
02:41:26.530 --> 02:41:26.800
well,

5842
02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:28.630
Steve would give you a different answer,

5843
02:41:28.820 --> 02:41:31.180
but I think that's moderately dangerous.

5844
02:41:31.750 --> 02:41:35.140
Fucking mediators and a pile of meat right next to your total,

5845
02:41:35.150 --> 02:41:36.790
you would feel like they would just eat that meat,

5846
02:41:36.820 --> 02:41:37.511
but maybe not.

5847
02:41:37.511 --> 02:41:38.650
It would be more appealing to them.

5848
02:41:38.651 --> 02:41:39.281
But here's the thing,

5849
02:41:39.281 --> 02:41:40.480
they're pretty curious,

5850
02:41:40.481 --> 02:41:40.661
right?

5851
02:41:40.661 --> 02:41:44.170
When you see things that haven't existed on the landscape or they'll look really

5852
02:41:44.171 --> 02:41:44.711
peculiar.

5853
02:41:44.711 --> 02:41:49.360
They have no fear of humans because they don't associate gunshot and human with

5854
02:41:49.361 --> 02:41:50.194
anything bad.

5855
02:41:51.250 --> 02:41:53.380
Or they don't associate humans with anything bad.

5856
02:41:53.381 --> 02:41:56.110
At least they associate humans with free gut pile.

5857
02:41:56.830 --> 02:41:57.130
Right.

5858
02:41:57.130 --> 02:41:57.963
If anything,

5859
02:41:58.070 --> 02:41:59.770
so the wind,

5860
02:41:59.890 --> 02:42:02.140
because the hunters will leave behind the gut pile.

5861
02:42:02.141 --> 02:42:03.340
So when I see humans,

5862
02:42:03.341 --> 02:42:07.360
so they hear gunshots and they go smell something pretty interesting and then

5863
02:42:07.361 --> 02:42:09.250
they see humans and they're like gut pile.

5864
02:42:09.550 --> 02:42:11.170
It's just like a gunshot.

5865
02:42:11.170 --> 02:42:12.430
Actually my draw them in.

5866
02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:13.030
Yeah,

5867
02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.601
absolutely.

5868
02:42:13.601 --> 02:42:15.070
Not In this particular case though,

5869
02:42:15.170 --> 02:42:16.003
the

5870
02:42:20.410 --> 02:42:22.750
death squad shirt by Tim Ferriss through that.

5871
02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:23.500
Amen.

5872
02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:23.970
I do what I can.

5873
02:42:23.970 --> 02:42:25.000
I made my week.

5874
02:42:25.770 --> 02:42:26.603
That's awesome.

5875
02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:27.933
The was awesome,

5876
02:42:27.970 --> 02:42:29.940
but we had a bear come into our camp and we,

5877
02:42:29.941 --> 02:42:30.940
we weren't filming this.

5878
02:42:30.941 --> 02:42:32.470
I was really upset.

5879
02:42:32.471 --> 02:42:34.720
On one hand they were not filming and then on the other hand I was really glad

5880
02:42:34.721 --> 02:42:36.100
they were fucking paying enough attention.

5881
02:42:36.310 --> 02:42:39.640
Steve was taken like a 20 minute power nap as he's wanting to do in his,

5882
02:42:40.270 --> 02:42:44.890
in his tent and this bear wanders over and it's literally like 20 feet away from

5883
02:42:44.891 --> 02:42:47.890
his 10th just sniffing around and we're all on the other side of camp and we're

5884
02:42:47.891 --> 02:42:50.620
like Steve Fucking grizzly bear.

5885
02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:53.560
And it turned out he heard us and he's like,

5886
02:42:53.561 --> 02:42:56.380
I'm not going to fucking pop out of that thing like a jack in the box and have a

5887
02:42:56.740 --> 02:42:58.090
scare the shit out of a grizzly bear.

5888
02:42:58.091 --> 02:42:58.601
He's like to the,

5889
02:42:58.601 --> 02:43:00.250
of a gun in the tent with them.

5890
02:43:00.430 --> 02:43:02.020
I don't think he did.

5891
02:43:02.470 --> 02:43:03.070
Whoa.

5892
02:43:03.070 --> 02:43:05.140
So what do you do when the bears that close?

5893
02:43:05.350 --> 02:43:05.591
Well,

5894
02:43:05.591 --> 02:43:06.161
what he did,

5895
02:43:06.161 --> 02:43:08.920
because then we had more bears coming to the camp.

5896
02:43:08.921 --> 02:43:10.690
Like the one that you saw sprinting into the camp,

5897
02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:12.183
uh,

5898
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:14.230
ran over us or waving his arms,

5899
02:43:14.290 --> 02:43:16.030
shot a shotgun in the air.

5900
02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:16.750
So like,

5901
02:43:16.750 --> 02:43:18.250
<v 0>but the one that was 20 feet away,</v>

5902
02:43:18.251 --> 02:43:19.570
that could have been a real problem.

5903
02:43:20.650 --> 02:43:21.130
<v 3>Right?</v>

5904
02:43:21.130 --> 02:43:21.371
I mean,

5905
02:43:21.371 --> 02:43:21.941
after the fact.

5906
02:43:21.941 --> 02:43:22.640
So Yannis,

5907
02:43:22.640 --> 02:43:23.473
I don't know if you met young,

5908
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:26.150
how'd you stop the bear when it was 20 feet away?

5909
02:43:26.260 --> 02:43:27.250
What he was probably,

5910
02:43:27.251 --> 02:43:28.720
it was probably a hundred feet away.

5911
02:43:28.721 --> 02:43:29.650
But the point being like,

5912
02:43:29.651 --> 02:43:30.371
it doesn't make a difference.

5913
02:43:30.371 --> 02:43:30.850
I mean,

5914
02:43:30.850 --> 02:43:31.380
got close.

5915
02:43:31.380 --> 02:43:32.710
They're extremely fast.

5916
02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:34.510
So to close the distance,

5917
02:43:34.511 --> 02:43:37.580
it's like if you have to re chamber around your fucking toast,

5918
02:43:37.740 --> 02:43:38.573
you know what I mean?

5919
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:39.370
Uh,

5920
02:43:39.370 --> 02:43:40.680
but Steve was very nonchalant about it.

5921
02:43:40.690 --> 02:43:43.000
But what I found so funny and it gives you a real perspective,

5922
02:43:43.001 --> 02:43:45.160
it's like things like New York City really stressed you out.

5923
02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:45.731
You know what I mean?

5924
02:43:45.731 --> 02:43:46.660
Like traffic and stuff.

5925
02:43:46.661 --> 02:43:48.130
He gets very anxious about it.

5926
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:51.760
Then you were sitting on the side of a lake in the middle of fucking nowhere,

5927
02:43:51.761 --> 02:43:56.140
like five hours flight time north of Fairbanks and there's a grizzly bear

5928
02:43:56.141 --> 02:44:00.280
charging at a camp and he found out that his cell phone had had been,

5929
02:44:00.370 --> 02:44:04.060
had fallen into a pool of insect repellent and they'd broken.

5930
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.801
He couldn't turn it on.

5931
02:44:04.801 --> 02:44:05.050
He's like,

5932
02:44:05.050 --> 02:44:07.310
Fuck God dammit,

5933
02:44:07.330 --> 02:44:08.051
my cell phone.

5934
02:44:08.051 --> 02:44:09.670
This is the third cell phone had broken him,

5935
02:44:09.671 --> 02:44:10.001
whatever.

5936
02:44:10.001 --> 02:44:11.980
He's so pissed and that there's a bear running into Kevin.

5937
02:44:11.981 --> 02:44:12.491
I'm just like Steve,

5938
02:44:12.491 --> 02:44:14.110
a bear bear bear.

5939
02:44:14.210 --> 02:44:15.840
<v 0>And he's just like my fucking fun.</v>

5940
02:44:15.841 --> 02:44:17.590
And Jesus,

5941
02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:21.320
it was running in to this that it is not a joke.

5942
02:44:21.380 --> 02:44:21.591
<v 3>No,</v>

5943
02:44:21.591 --> 02:44:22.101
not a joke.

5944
02:44:22.101 --> 02:44:22.401
I was like,

5945
02:44:22.401 --> 02:44:24.710
this is really indicative of like a different set of world,

5946
02:44:24.740 --> 02:44:26.270
like life experiences.

5947
02:44:26.271 --> 02:44:26.691
And then he's like,

5948
02:44:26.691 --> 02:44:26.991
all right,

5949
02:44:26.991 --> 02:44:27.261
all right.

5950
02:44:27.261 --> 02:44:28.011
And he gets up and he's like,

5951
02:44:28.011 --> 02:44:28.431
Whoa,

5952
02:44:28.431 --> 02:44:30.110
runs towards us or shooting the shotgun and runs away.

5953
02:44:30.111 --> 02:44:30.321
He's like,

5954
02:44:30.321 --> 02:44:30.561
all right.

5955
02:44:30.561 --> 02:44:31.060
Anyway,

5956
02:44:31.060 --> 02:44:31.270
where

5957
02:44:31.270 --> 02:44:31.810
<v 0>was that?</v>

5958
02:44:31.810 --> 02:44:36.460
You had a Alex Honnold on the podcast yesterday and he's the Free Solo climber

5959
02:44:36.461 --> 02:44:36.720
that,

5960
02:44:36.720 --> 02:44:37.210
oh,

5961
02:44:37.210 --> 02:44:38.043
does those,

5962
02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:39.340
and he was just like,

5963
02:44:39.341 --> 02:44:39.491
yeah,

5964
02:44:39.491 --> 02:44:40.510
it's no big deal when I do it.

5965
02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:41.260
No big deal.

5966
02:44:41.260 --> 02:44:41.531
Like,

5967
02:44:41.531 --> 02:44:41.980
you know,

5968
02:44:41.980 --> 02:44:45.040
like we were talking about one thing that he climbed and he's like,

5969
02:44:45.041 --> 02:44:45.401
well it's,

5970
02:44:45.401 --> 02:44:46.840
it's really not that big a deal.

5971
02:44:46.841 --> 02:44:47.320
It's like,

5972
02:44:47.320 --> 02:44:47.560
you know,

5973
02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:48.380
people have climbed.

5974
02:44:48.380 --> 02:44:49.870
I was the first person to solo it,

5975
02:44:49.871 --> 02:44:51.010
but people have climbed it.

5976
02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:53.530
What do you mean you're the first person you mean?

5977
02:44:53.531 --> 02:44:57.760
No one in the human race has ever climbed this shit without a rope,

5978
02:44:57.910 --> 02:44:58.810
but you,

5979
02:44:58.990 --> 02:45:00.850
and it's not a big deal to him.

5980
02:45:00.851 --> 02:45:01.250
It was sad.

5981
02:45:01.250 --> 02:45:02.083
It's not a big deal.

5982
02:45:02.110 --> 02:45:02.411
I was,

5983
02:45:02.411 --> 02:45:03.640
I'm the only person to ever do it,

5984
02:45:03.641 --> 02:45:06.340
but whatever the fuck are you talking about,

5985
02:45:06.341 --> 02:45:08.440
whatever to any other human being,

5986
02:45:08.441 --> 02:45:11.230
like you're talking about something thousands of feet in the sky,

5987
02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:12.400
you're climbing up.

5988
02:45:12.970 --> 02:45:15.520
It's like walking on the moon by on their own planet.

5989
02:45:15.610 --> 02:45:18.250
He was talking about one time when we climbed up and he was halfway,

5990
02:45:18.251 --> 02:45:20.710
he was on his way up and he realized he forgot his chalk bag,

5991
02:45:21.370 --> 02:45:22.240
how to keep going.

5992
02:45:22.390 --> 02:45:23.920
So he got to a ledge.

5993
02:45:23.921 --> 02:45:25.990
There's a famous ledge where some campers,

5994
02:45:25.991 --> 02:45:27.430
where were other hikers were there,

5995
02:45:27.730 --> 02:45:28.200
who were,

5996
02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:28.520
uh,

5997
02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:32.830
taking a nap because it takes days for them to go up with ropes.

5998
02:45:33.070 --> 02:45:35.710
This motherfucker is doing with no ropes so that he can kind of borrow some

5999
02:45:35.711 --> 02:45:40.150
chalk or we got some chalk and then climbed up to the top with it.

6000
02:45:40.151 --> 02:45:40.421
They're like,

6001
02:45:40.421 --> 02:45:41.680
what the fuck is this guy doing?

6002
02:45:41.681 --> 02:45:43.900
Could you imagine you're camped out on a ledge?

6003
02:45:43.990 --> 02:45:44.351
And he said,

6004
02:45:44.351 --> 02:45:44.621
by the way,

6005
02:45:44.621 --> 02:45:46.540
the ledge is half the size of this desk.

6006
02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:47.590
Okay,

6007
02:45:47.590 --> 02:45:49.000
so there's two tents,

6008
02:45:49.090 --> 02:45:51.160
two different camps on this ledge.

6009
02:45:51.310 --> 02:45:52.990
He climbs up there and he's like,

6010
02:45:52.991 --> 02:45:53.890
can I get some chalk?

6011
02:45:54.120 --> 02:45:54.461
And I'm like,

6012
02:45:54.461 --> 02:45:54.641
yeah,

6013
02:45:54.641 --> 02:45:55.211
here's some shock.

6014
02:45:55.211 --> 02:45:55.840
Thanks.

6015
02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:57.720
And he's climbing up the rest of the lab stuff.

6016
02:45:58.020 --> 02:45:59.590
And that's normal to him.

6017
02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:00.573
You know,

6018
02:46:00.970 --> 02:46:02.350
that makes me feel like such a pussy.

6019
02:46:02.380 --> 02:46:05.500
But we brought up porn stars and the kid basically shit his pants.

6020
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:06.703
You see that?

6021
02:46:08.290 --> 02:46:09.080
That brought yet?

6022
02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:09.913
Do you want to go?

6023
02:46:10.040 --> 02:46:10.460
Yeah.

6024
02:46:10.460 --> 02:46:11.293
I just need to know though.

6025
02:46:11.660 --> 02:46:12.100
Yeah,

6026
02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:12.570
come on,

6027
02:46:12.570 --> 02:46:13.250
let's go.

6028
02:46:13.250 --> 02:46:14.750
I'll give you a ticket and have some fun,

6029
02:46:14.751 --> 02:46:15.160
man.

6030
02:46:15.160 --> 02:46:16.370
It was a big UFC too.

6031
02:46:16.760 --> 02:46:17.593
Um,

6032
02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:18.520
but he,

6033
02:46:18.520 --> 02:46:18.861
he,

6034
02:46:18.861 --> 02:46:19.071
you know,

6035
02:46:19.071 --> 02:46:21.680
Brian Dates Porn stars upon occasion,

6036
02:46:21.830 --> 02:46:23.900
basically steady diet now.

6037
02:46:24.230 --> 02:46:24.471
But,

6038
02:46:24.471 --> 02:46:24.880
um,

6039
02:46:24.880 --> 02:46:25.730
it can't go backwards.

6040
02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:26.091
He,

6041
02:46:26.091 --> 02:46:26.510
uh,

6042
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:27.343
when he,

6043
02:46:27.500 --> 02:46:28.890
when he found out on the Alex,

6044
02:46:28.890 --> 02:46:29.720
John was like,

6045
02:46:29.720 --> 02:46:30.450
really?

6046
02:46:30.450 --> 02:46:30.590
Okay.

6047
02:46:30.590 --> 02:46:33.320
<v 2>Do you know porn stars all of the sudden</v>

6048
02:46:34.850 --> 02:46:35.930
disappeared.

6049
02:46:36.410 --> 02:46:37.850
Eyebrows went up.

6050
02:46:38.060 --> 02:46:39.230
He was still shocked.

6051
02:46:39.231 --> 02:46:39.940
And we,

6052
02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:43.390
<v 0>we found that there was a very important moment because a very important moment</v>

6053
02:46:43.391 --> 02:46:43.690
where like,

6054
02:46:43.690 --> 02:46:44.523
oh,

6055
02:46:44.710 --> 02:46:48.220
because his comfort zone and talking about death defying feats of,

6056
02:46:48.221 --> 02:46:48.610
of,

6057
02:46:48.610 --> 02:46:49.240
you know,

6058
02:46:49.240 --> 02:46:53.230
keeping your shit together under pressure climbing without a fucking chalk bag,

6059
02:46:53.890 --> 02:46:55.510
1500 feet in the sky.

6060
02:46:55.540 --> 02:46:58.240
That was nothing to him just the other day at the office.

6061
02:46:58.960 --> 02:46:59.793
No know,

6062
02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:01.660
oh girl has sex for living.

6063
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.990
<v 2>Oh Gee,</v>

6064
02:47:02.991 --> 02:47:04.010
golly.

6065
02:47:04.740 --> 02:47:08.240
He might've not had it in his pants with Brian's descriptions and he probably

6066
02:47:08.241 --> 02:47:11.680
won't want to go to Mexico because I guess that area that he,

6067
02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:15.590
he's going to climb I guess like 16 people just got murdered there the other

6068
02:47:15.591 --> 02:47:15.861
day.

6069
02:47:15.861 --> 02:47:17.600
Like the town that he's going to,

6070
02:47:17.601 --> 02:47:18.110
are you sure?

6071
02:47:18.110 --> 02:47:18.440
Yeah.

6072
02:47:18.440 --> 02:47:19.940
Somebody was sent me on Twitter.

6073
02:47:20.050 --> 02:47:20.883
<v 0>Oh my God.</v>

6074
02:47:21.070 --> 02:47:21.440
Yeah.

6075
02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:21.611
Yeah.

6076
02:47:21.611 --> 02:47:23.920
Well maybe he doesn't know that yet because he hasn't read the Internet.

6077
02:47:23.980 --> 02:47:24.340
Right.

6078
02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:24.731
And Kid,

6079
02:47:24.731 --> 02:47:25.230
he doesn't,

6080
02:47:25.230 --> 02:47:26.710
he never watched a TV show.

6081
02:47:26.740 --> 02:47:28.770
He lives in a van down by the river in a van.

6082
02:47:28.790 --> 02:47:30.190
She looked like Moab or something.

6083
02:47:30.280 --> 02:47:32.860
Well he just travels around going to different places to climb.

6084
02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:33.550
Yeah,

6085
02:47:33.550 --> 02:47:34.240
he gets like,

6086
02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:35.890
I guess he has like a bank account somewhere.

6087
02:47:36.040 --> 02:47:36.821
He has sponsors.

6088
02:47:36.821 --> 02:47:37.611
They send him some money.

6089
02:47:37.611 --> 02:47:39.190
He doesn't need much cause he lives in a van.

6090
02:47:39.490 --> 02:47:40.281
Really fascinating.

6091
02:47:40.281 --> 02:47:41.260
The kid were dragging him.

6092
02:47:41.350 --> 02:47:41.650
Can you,

6093
02:47:41.650 --> 02:47:42.580
can you get some hookers?

6094
02:47:44.110 --> 02:47:45.550
Pretty girls that uh,

6095
02:47:45.580 --> 02:47:45.821
you know,

6096
02:47:45.821 --> 02:47:46.581
have loose morals.

6097
02:47:46.581 --> 02:47:47.440
So that's what I'm trying to say.

6098
02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:49.580
I don't mean like actual hookers.

6099
02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:51.341
Real hookers.

6100
02:47:51.341 --> 02:47:51.790
Don't do,

6101
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:52.623
we can do whatever you got,

6102
02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:53.740
but brings,

6103
02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:54.970
bring some girls that,

6104
02:47:54.971 --> 02:47:55.570
uh,

6105
02:47:55.570 --> 02:47:56.410
that know how to party.

6106
02:47:56.770 --> 02:47:57.603
All right,

6107
02:47:58.740 --> 02:47:59.573
let's,

6108
02:47:59.650 --> 02:48:01.390
let's throw Alex to the wolves.

6109
02:48:02.580 --> 02:48:03.413
All right.

6110
02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:04.250
Listen man,

6111
02:48:04.250 --> 02:48:05.950
there's fucking another awesome podcast.

6112
02:48:05.980 --> 02:48:06.813
We should do

6113
02:48:07.010 --> 02:48:07.440
<v 8>it.</v>

6114
02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:07.981
This is great.

6115
02:48:07.981 --> 02:48:11.280
And I love sad that we have to stop game of Thrones table.

6116
02:48:11.490 --> 02:48:12.031
She'll miss you.

6117
02:48:12.031 --> 02:48:12.301
Shit,

6118
02:48:12.301 --> 02:48:12.601
isn't it?

6119
02:48:12.601 --> 02:48:13.170
I love it.

6120
02:48:13.170 --> 02:48:13.561
Yeah.

6121
02:48:13.561 --> 02:48:15.890
I'm really happy when we had this,

6122
02:48:15.891 --> 02:48:16.100
uh,

6123
02:48:16.100 --> 02:48:16.640
made.

6124
02:48:16.640 --> 02:48:17.210
It's,

6125
02:48:17.210 --> 02:48:18.750
it's awesome dude.

6126
02:48:18.810 --> 02:48:19.860
You're the fucking shit man.

6127
02:48:19.861 --> 02:48:20.070
We,

6128
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.881
every time you're in here,

6129
02:48:20.881 --> 02:48:22.050
we have amazing conversations.

6130
02:48:22.150 --> 02:48:23.640
We could do this forever and ever and ever.

6131
02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:24.420
Um,

6132
02:48:24.420 --> 02:48:24.900
uh,

6133
02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:27.600
four hour chef is the most recent one.

6134
02:48:27.840 --> 02:48:32.840
Only available at Amazon through your website is the four hour chef.

6135
02:48:33.370 --> 02:48:37.410
You can go to a four hour blog.com.

6136
02:48:37.411 --> 02:48:39.660
All these places you can get tons of sample chapters,

6137
02:48:39.661 --> 02:48:40.494
the whole nine yards.

6138
02:48:40.680 --> 02:48:41.210
Beautiful.

6139
02:48:41.210 --> 02:48:41.491
Ah,

6140
02:48:41.491 --> 02:48:43.500
if anybody wants to follow you on Twitter,

6141
02:48:43.620 --> 02:48:45.000
it's Tim Ferris,

6142
02:48:45.030 --> 02:48:46.380
f e R R,

6143
02:48:46.440 --> 02:48:47.190
I s.

6144
02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:48.470
S t Ferriss.

6145
02:48:48.500 --> 02:48:49.111
Tim Ferriss.

6146
02:48:49.111 --> 02:48:49.591
Tim Ferriss.

6147
02:48:49.591 --> 02:48:50.381
Not Yes.

6148
02:48:50.381 --> 02:48:50.700
T.

6149
02:48:50.700 --> 02:48:51.031
Okay.

6150
02:48:51.031 --> 02:48:52.140
Don't go to Tim Ferris.

6151
02:48:52.260 --> 02:48:53.410
Is there an actual Tim Ferris?

6152
02:48:53.980 --> 02:48:54.450
<v 2>I have.</v>

6153
02:48:54.450 --> 02:48:54.910
I have.

6154
02:48:54.910 --> 02:48:55.910
I have that one as well.

6155
02:48:57.180 --> 02:48:57.271
<v 8>Oh,</v>

6156
02:48:57.271 --> 02:48:58.104
that's you too.

6157
02:48:58.160 --> 02:48:59.220
As long as I tweeted you,

6158
02:48:59.221 --> 02:49:00.060
but it's the wrong one.

6159
02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:01.560
This is Tim Ferriss character.

6160
02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:03.780
I look and it says listening,

6161
02:49:03.781 --> 02:49:04.380
reading,

6162
02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:04.890
talking.

6163
02:49:04.890 --> 02:49:05.000
Oh,

6164
02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:05.380
nevermind.

6165
02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:06.660
That's probably my way to wisdom.

6166
02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:07.570
That's probably with one ass.

6167
02:49:07.571 --> 02:49:09.510
I imagine this is some other motherfucker.

6168
02:49:09.610 --> 02:49:10.010
Yeah,

6169
02:49:10.010 --> 02:49:11.130
I gave the wrong motherfucker.

6170
02:49:11.570 --> 02:49:12.400
God dammit.

6171
02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:12.770
Twitter.

6172
02:49:12.770 --> 02:49:13.960
You guys going to get a Twitter bot?

6173
02:49:13.990 --> 02:49:14.460
Thanks.

6174
02:49:14.460 --> 02:49:14.890
Okay.

6175
02:49:14.890 --> 02:49:15.431
Sorry.

6176
02:49:15.431 --> 02:49:16.264
I fucked up.

6177
02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:17.393
I'm going gonna write this down.

6178
02:49:17.410 --> 02:49:19.870
I fucked up the real,

6179
02:49:21.570 --> 02:49:22.403
what are you doing?

6180
02:49:22.660 --> 02:49:23.391
Don't do that dude.

6181
02:49:23.391 --> 02:49:24.550
You going to get us kicked off of Youtube?

6182
02:49:24.551 --> 02:49:28.660
You fuck the real Tim Ferris at t Ferris,

6183
02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:32.410
double r double s Twitter.

6184
02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:36.970
We're going to be in West Palm Beach next week as we are tickets are available

6185
02:49:36.971 --> 02:49:38.920
at [inaudible] dot com I believe.

6186
02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:39.793
Uh,

6187
02:49:40.030 --> 02:49:40.863
yes,

6188
02:49:41.370 --> 02:49:42.070
that'd be fine.

6189
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.341
Yeah.

6190
02:49:42.341 --> 02:49:43.174
We're going to have a good time.

6191
02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:44.710
It's a Joey Diaz,

6192
02:49:44.830 --> 02:49:47.050
Brian and I and a.

6193
02:49:47.050 --> 02:49:47.883
We're going to be,

6194
02:49:48.220 --> 02:49:49.060
it's a huge place.

6195
02:49:49.061 --> 02:49:49.601
It's a lot of fun,

6196
02:49:49.601 --> 02:49:50.950
but it's selling fast.

6197
02:49:50.951 --> 02:49:51.790
It's almost sold out.

6198
02:49:51.791 --> 02:49:52.151
So,

6199
02:49:52.151 --> 02:49:52.560
uh,

6200
02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:53.141
get in there.

6201
02:49:53.141 --> 02:49:54.130
You're dirty bitches.

6202
02:49:54.460 --> 02:49:55.150
Um,

6203
02:49:55.150 --> 02:49:56.560
West Palm Beach Improv.

6204
02:49:56.561 --> 02:49:57.370
Go to [inaudible].

6205
02:49:57.370 --> 02:49:57.590
Dot.

6206
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:58.660
Got to go Google.

6207
02:49:58.720 --> 02:49:59.553
You could find it,

6208
02:49:59.560 --> 02:49:59.801
but yeah,

6209
02:49:59.801 --> 02:50:00.461
we're going to have a good time.

6210
02:50:00.461 --> 02:50:01.390
That's a fun place to do.

6211
02:50:01.391 --> 02:50:02.080
Stand up.

6212
02:50:02.080 --> 02:50:02.621
They're crazy.

6213
02:50:02.621 --> 02:50:05.230
You should have a fucking passport to go to Miami.

6214
02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:06.220
That area.

6215
02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:06.700
That'll air.

6216
02:50:06.700 --> 02:50:06.891
They,

6217
02:50:06.891 --> 02:50:07.510
they're nutty.

6218
02:50:07.510 --> 02:50:09.610
If they know how to party in this Oxycontin's everywhere,

6219
02:50:10.090 --> 02:50:10.510
we'll hope.

6220
02:50:10.510 --> 02:50:12.340
Hopefully we'll keep it together for the entire weekend.

6221
02:50:12.580 --> 02:50:12.971
And uh,

6222
02:50:12.971 --> 02:50:14.800
we're also going to Vegas this weekend.

6223
02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:15.610
Um,

6224
02:50:15.610 --> 02:50:16.510
the West,

6225
02:50:16.570 --> 02:50:17.403
uh,

6226
02:50:17.410 --> 02:50:18.243
what am I talking about?

6227
02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:19.630
West Palm Beach next weekend.

6228
02:50:19.631 --> 02:50:21.130
This weekend we're at Mandalay bay.

6229
02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:21.581
Uh,

6230
02:50:21.581 --> 02:50:22.930
Brian Callan is joining us.

6231
02:50:22.931 --> 02:50:24.670
First Time Brian's ever come on the road with us.

6232
02:50:24.910 --> 02:50:25.900
So it's Brian,

6233
02:50:26.110 --> 02:50:26.800
Ari,

6234
02:50:26.800 --> 02:50:27.633
me,

6235
02:50:27.760 --> 02:50:28.421
Brian Booboo,

6236
02:50:28.421 --> 02:50:31.180
red bands going to be there with hookers and Alex Honnold not hunger.

6237
02:50:31.180 --> 02:50:31.860
It's not really hunger.

6238
02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:34.810
It's just girls who have money that they give them.

6239
02:50:34.811 --> 02:50:35.740
Sometimes they have sex,

6240
02:50:35.741 --> 02:50:36.574
but that's not a worker.

6241
02:50:37.690 --> 02:50:38.523
That's what they do,

6242
02:50:38.560 --> 02:50:39.393
right?

6243
02:50:39.970 --> 02:50:40.660
They're porn.

6244
02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:41.420
They're not hookers.

6245
02:50:41.420 --> 02:50:41.770
No.

6246
02:50:41.770 --> 02:50:42.250
No.

6247
02:50:42.250 --> 02:50:45.280
But they get money for sex and a classically in the Bible,

6248
02:50:45.281 --> 02:50:46.360
I think that makes a hooker,

6249
02:50:46.361 --> 02:50:48.010
but they didn't have the Internet back then,

6250
02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:48.993
so fuck them.

6251
02:50:49.540 --> 02:50:51.340
Right performance artists,

6252
02:50:51.730 --> 02:50:52.541
performance artists,

6253
02:50:52.541 --> 02:50:55.750

6257
02:51:02.740 --> 02:51:05.800

6258
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:06.291
All right?

6259
02:51:06.291 --> 02:51:06.450
Yeah,

6260
02:51:06.450 --> 02:51:07.060
Fox,

6261
02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:09.700
we will see you tomorrow with the real Rick Ross.

6262
02:51:09.880 --> 02:51:12.490
Not that rapper dude who just got his car shot up,

6263
02:51:12.820 --> 02:51:15.190
but the actual real Rick Ross,

6264
02:51:15.220 --> 02:51:15.611
allegedly,

6265
02:51:15.611 --> 02:51:17.170
it's going to be a very interesting,

6266
02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:17.741
allegedly.

6267
02:51:17.741 --> 02:51:17.921
Yeah,

6268
02:51:17.921 --> 02:51:19.540
50 cent doesn't believe it really happened,

6269
02:51:19.570 --> 02:51:24.550
but I believe very few people make a joke and shoot at a Rolls Royce.

6270
02:51:24.850 --> 02:51:25.720
That's just me though.

6271
02:51:26.320 --> 02:51:27.310
I don't think that's worth it for.

6272
02:51:27.311 --> 02:51:27.570
Listen,

6273
02:51:27.570 --> 02:51:29.560
the money that you're going to get out of that story,

6274
02:51:30.010 --> 02:51:31.640
what the fuck do I know about Bobo's thing?

6275
02:51:32.460 --> 02:51:33.250
All right,

6276
02:51:33.250 --> 02:51:34.120
we'll see you guys tomorrow.

6277
02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:35.140
Go Fuck Yourself.
