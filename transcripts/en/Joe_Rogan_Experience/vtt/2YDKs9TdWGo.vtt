<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

20
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>There's not one place where you can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can get one.</v>

<v Speaker 1>ceiling,</v>

27
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fermented,</v>

28
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>so carbonated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

29
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but there's no one source where you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely get 100% unbiased factual</v>

31
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:15.140
<v Speaker 1>information as the news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is leaning one way or leaning</v>

32
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>another way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even CNN,</v>

33
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>which I used to trust all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fuck up all the time.</v>

34
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 1>They're always having to print</v>
<v Speaker 1>retractions.</v>

35
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>There was some thing that was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>around today.</v>

36
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not one news source where I can</v>

37
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please just give me the unbiased</v>

38
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>information with no left or right lane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>I get that.</v>

40
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Which is hot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we talked about beforehand.</v>

41
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 2>But when there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

42
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 2>even the idea of the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people don't understand it,</v>

43
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 2>people don't understand journalism a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time.</v>

44
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Like literally when people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

45
00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 2>it's fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

46
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't print fake news because they,</v>

47
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 2>you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever have anything in the New</v>

48
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 2>Yorker?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever be quoted in the New York</v>

49
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Article?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

50
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 2>they literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you talk to the journalists then two</v>

51
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:07.911
<v Speaker 2>different fact checkers call you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>confirm what you said and like,</v>

52
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:10.920
<v Speaker 2>it's this true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

53
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I literally,</v>

54
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:17.181
<v Speaker 2>this is in an article about someone else</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I gave a quote for and like,</v>

55
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 2>did you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did,</v>

56
00:02:19.261 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 2>and you can confirm that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do that.</v>

57
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.330
<v Speaker 2>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made every major journalistic,</v>

58
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>outfit.</v>

59
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 2>They did the New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington Post,</v>

60
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like name the big ones.</v>

61
00:02:30.961 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 2>They all have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not as stringent as the New York</v>

62
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 2>as the New Yorker because near her only</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes out once a week.</v>

63
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 2>But they all have fact checkers and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get,</v>

64
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 2>and the thing is these institutions can</v>
<v Speaker 2>get sued,</v>

65
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a good example,</v>

66
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an example.</v>

67
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>The conor Mcgregor fight New York Times</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote an article about the conor</v>

68
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they said that he</v>

69
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>was covered in blood and rescued by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>referee before he fell through the</v>

70
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I contacted them on twitter and I said,</v>

71
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>you in</v>

72
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 3>this day and age you can't say things</v>
<v Speaker 3>that everyone knows are false.</v>

73
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Like millions of people watch that</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight.</v>

74
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:10.260
<v Speaker 3>There was no blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was not falling through the ropes and</v>

75
00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 3>the referee rescue them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You made that up.</v>

76
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 3>He was outclassed and battered by a far</v>
<v Speaker 3>superior boxer,</v>

77
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 3>which is what most boxing people</v>
<v Speaker 3>expected.</v>

78
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 3>That's the real story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

79
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 3>but you guys added a bunch of shit to it</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they to shade it,</v>

80
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 3>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 3>It's not just shading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

82
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 3>it's a straight lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

83
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 3>It's not a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really,</v>

84
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no listen consequential.</v>

85
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 3>It's not a really significant moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a big moment in time and</v>

86
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 3>the result is the same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but their description of the result</v>

87
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 3>makes you wonder how much other things</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you do this too?</v>

88
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 3>How many other subjects do you flavor in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird way?</v>

89
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.030
<v Speaker 4>Their attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I remember,</v>

90
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.180
<v Speaker 4>I remember seeing you right then I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

91
00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's cool.</v>

92
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.613
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

93
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.010
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they change it.</v>

94
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

95
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 3>They were checking they even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they still use hyperbole.</v>

96
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 3>Even in their retraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said his face was completely</v>

97
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 3>swollen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

98
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a quadrant of his face was</v>
<v Speaker 3>swollen.</v>

99
00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 3>A tiny amount and a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>swelling from a boxing match.</v>

100
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:08.190
<v Speaker 3>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not some crazy fucking Haseem Rockmont</v>

101
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.010
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that one had an iron on his</v>

102
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:12.600
<v Speaker 3>head?</v>

103
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.690
<v Speaker 4>Literally the fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe the craziest thing I've ever</v>

104
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:16.380
<v Speaker 4>seen in a fight.</v>

105
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.620
<v Speaker 3>It was this disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's huge Hematoma grummond that grown</v>

106
00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:22.830
<v Speaker 3>out of his forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you could find that Haseem ragging</v>

107
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 3>on Lennox Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

108
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 3>Was it in Lennox Lewis fight?</v>

109
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.850
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

110
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

111
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.870
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like he,</v>

112
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 4>he literally had to go to Dr Pimple</v>
<v Speaker 4>popper.</v>

113
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People lover.</v>

114
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.780
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that.</v>

115
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was wild.</v>

116
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was an enormous swelling in his</v>

117
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 4>head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He looks like a war criminal and an</v>

118
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 4>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did the harder to do.</v>

119
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if that,</v>

120
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:51.770
<v Speaker 4>you mean that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

121
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't disagree that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they do shade invariably,</v>

122
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.980
<v Speaker 4>but shouldn't,</v>

123
00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.460
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should tell the exact story.</v>

124
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.180
<v Speaker 3>That exact story was really clear for</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody that watched the 2 million</v>

125
00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:05.580
<v Speaker 3>people plus that watched it on paper</v>
<v Speaker 3>view or more.</v>

126
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.890
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't something that you can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>away with bullshitting</v>

127
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 4>about d.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

128
00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 4>but do you do this wasn't a problem five</v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>

129
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.140
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it wasn't like it wasn't a problem.</v>

130
00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a problem day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing that I was yelling</v>

131
00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:28.130
<v Speaker 4>at somebody yesterday of like the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once Pete,</v>

132
00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:30.500
<v Speaker 4>once Fox News created this thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

133
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.590
<v Speaker 4>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

134
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.260
<v Speaker 4>extremely shaded shit and people saw</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's a market for it.</v>

135
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.070
<v Speaker 4>There were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

136
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.900
<v Speaker 4>we'll do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll do that now.</v>

137
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.830
<v Speaker 4>And then everyone's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's reacting but they don't think</v>

138
00:05:45.831 --> 00:05:46.850
<v Speaker 4>they're reacting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

139
00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:48.590
<v Speaker 4>and now the New York Times is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go the other way.</v>

140
00:05:48.591 --> 00:05:52.670
<v Speaker 4>Where there they hired this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bret stephens to write op ed pieces.</v>

141
00:05:52.671 --> 00:05:54.350
<v Speaker 4>And every week there's a new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

142
00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:56.690
<v Speaker 4>what did you just say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the hill.</v>

143
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to be like,</v>

144
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.940
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to be a kind of moderate</v>
<v Speaker 2>or see both sides and a lot of people on</v>

145
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:05.241
<v Speaker 2>the left are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

146
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:09.660
<v Speaker 2>but that's how are you seeing both sides</v>
<v Speaker 2>to like slavery or how we're using like</v>

147
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 2>the fuck you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's both sides of the climate</v>

148
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 2>change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all their scientists and not</v>

149
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like those the sides.</v>

150
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 2>So why are you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is basically appeasement,</v>

151
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.920
<v Speaker 2>I guess as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

152
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

153
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.170
<v Speaker 2>consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

154
00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:29.560
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

155
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 2>when I was to get into this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation,</v>

156
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't even talking about journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about government.</v>

157
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking work it takes just to be like</v>

158
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I can worry about statutes and</v>

159
00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 2>fucking the FCC and fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.340
<v Speaker 2>executive orders and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never had to do all this.</v>

161
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Like why is this so much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's,</v>

162
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean they would say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

163
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 2>to be an active democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only as good as citizens and all</v>

164
00:06:58.821 --> 00:06:59.654
<v Speaker 2>that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

165
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like we're all more</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved and it's worse.</v>

166
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's like it's way more upsetting.</v>

167
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 2>It's constant upset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it feels like havoc every single</v>

168
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

169
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Well it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely not good and it's,</v>

170
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.320
<v Speaker 1>especially from the environmental side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever a president is shortsighted</v>

171
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:24.550
<v Speaker 1>about the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scares the shit out of me because</v>

172
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 1>that has repercussions for generation</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon generation.</v>

173
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's doing it for short term money</v>

174
00:07:29.171 --> 00:07:30.004
<v Speaker 1>grabbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I like the EPA being essentially gutted</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing in Alaska where</v>

176
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.380
<v Speaker 1>they're making roads and they're setting</v>
<v Speaker 1>up mines,</v>

177
00:07:38.381 --> 00:07:41.980
<v Speaker 1>knew the salmon fisheries where their</v>
<v Speaker 1>monuments monuments.</v>

178
00:07:41.981 --> 00:07:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's scary because it's just,</v>

179
00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.290
<v Speaker 1>they're just chopping away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just chopping away and the repercussions</v>

180
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:49.840
<v Speaker 1>could be forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have an amazing system here in this</v>

181
00:07:49.841 --> 00:07:54.000
<v Speaker 1>country in terms of like the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>public land that we have and the</v>

182
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.320
<v Speaker 1>beautiful places where you can go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out.</v>

183
00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:01.860
<v Speaker 1>All it takes is one or two assholes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a mine one on one or two assholes</v>

184
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:05.200
<v Speaker 1>that allow drilling for oil in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

185
00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:07.240
<v Speaker 1>All they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all they have to do is extract resources</v>

186
00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>from these public places and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked.</v>

187
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.290
<v Speaker 1>And those places are ruined forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not just for your kids but for your</v>

188
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:15.910
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For everybody.</v>

189
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I hope he like equipment cause</v>

190
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:20.910
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna be a lot of fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment of these places.</v>

191
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing that I,</v>

192
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.600
<v Speaker 2>that curious about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

193
00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.350
<v Speaker 2>people that voted for trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is this what you wanted?</v>

194
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Like honestly,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

196
00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:34.660
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a feeling I have a notion that</v>

197
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:36.700
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't like,</v>

198
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.280
<v Speaker 2>they felt excluded by like elitism and</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to Davos in the hamptons and all</v>

199
00:08:42.281 --> 00:08:46.840
<v Speaker 2>these places and like the Aspen ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>festival and Ted talks and all this</v>

200
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:47.710
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

201
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

202
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:52.240
<v Speaker 2>But this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I get the notion of fuck you like,</v>

203
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.220
<v Speaker 2>but this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

205
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Obama stressed you out on this level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the level of trump stress that like</v>

206
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 4>is just created in the culture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I was saying.</v>

207
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 4>Like it's havoc every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a fucking melee.</v>

208
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.740
<v Speaker 4>But do you feel the stress every day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

209
00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.860
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you like,</v>

210
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:16.920
<v Speaker 4>do like there are days where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't look at my phone.</v>

211
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 4>I literally can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a couple of days ago I was looking</v>

212
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:23.310
<v Speaker 4>at something and it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was maybe before that,</v>

213
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 4>maybe two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three days ago.</v>

214
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 4>There are days where it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

215
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:33.470
<v Speaker 4>it's so like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the red for like cultural or</v>

216
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 4>political toxicity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I'm just like,</v>

217
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:36.451
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

218
00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't,</v>

219
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 4>this is like inducing cortisol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a good argument also to</v>

220
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 4>stay the fuck away from the news and</v>
<v Speaker 4>social media for a few days a week.</v>

221
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there've been a few.</v>

222
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 4>You see the people past couple of days</v>
<v Speaker 4>that like facebook exact span.</v>

223

224
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of torn society apart.</v>

225
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.470
<v Speaker 4>Didn't mean to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoops.</v>

226
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw that one facebook exact was</v>

227
00:09:57.331 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 4>apologizing for what they've done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've essentially engineered people to</v>

228
00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 4>be programmed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

229
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:02.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

230
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:04.770
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've essentially engineered this thing</v>

231
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 4>or you're going to be addicted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to be tuning into it</v>

232
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.550
<v Speaker 4>constantly and the things that are gonna</v>
<v Speaker 4>attract you the most,</v>

233
00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 4>the things that freaking the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's going to take prominence.</v>

234
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

235
00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:14.680
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

236
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a market that's definitely part</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the market,</v>

237
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

238
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 4>it's a bad idea to have a popularity</v>
<v Speaker 4>contest to see who controls the news.</v>

239
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what we have.</v>

240
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.190
<v Speaker 4>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a real example of an old system</v>

241
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:33.750
<v Speaker 4>that really shouldn't exist anymore.</v>

242
00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:36.020
<v Speaker 4>I had an idea that a couple of weeks ago</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it was like,</v>

243
00:10:36.021 --> 00:10:41.021
<v Speaker 4>I got to run that by joe as like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>jumping off point for conversation robot</v>

244
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 4>president.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

245
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

246
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 4>Like logical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super logical here.</v>

247
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Speaker 4>Logic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stats,</v>

248
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 4>no emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no emotions.</v>

249
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes all of history.</v>

250
00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his other 2000 recorded history,</v>

251
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 4>2000 year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are,</v>

252
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really 200 years but like,</v>

253
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 4>and takes it all into account.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even takes literature into account.</v>

254
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like plots,</v>

255
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.560
<v Speaker 4>like take Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No account takes plots,</v>

256
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:11.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hammer,</v>

257
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 4>the ava,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all that shit.</v>

258
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:17.540
<v Speaker 4>And then wouldn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't that kind of what you want?</v>

259
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in that kind of what you want.</v>

260
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 4>And even if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

261
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.600
<v Speaker 4>if they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the robot President says I've come to</v>

262
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 4>this decision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was 55,</v>

263
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:31.410
<v Speaker 4>45 in favor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's all like the older you get.</v>

264
00:11:31.411 --> 00:11:33.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a hundred percent anything.</v>

265
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.130
<v Speaker 4>Like even though I really love Louise</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joke in his last special,</v>

266
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.860
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which weirdly didn't make any top 10</v>

267
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:42.500
<v Speaker 4>list for the year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

268
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of those weird things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I listened to it on the plane back from</v>

269
00:11:45.841 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 4>Hawaii a couple of weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm great.</v>

270
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.970
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last I watched it actually the last</v>

271
00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 4>few bits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're fucking killer.</v>

272
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.790
<v Speaker 4>Just kill out the one about the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fingering and the Magic Mike.</v>

273
00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

274
00:11:58.331 --> 00:11:59.000
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The family.</v>

275
00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.620
<v Speaker 4>Mine was great and the Finger Magic</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

276
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 4>my bidding put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>damn it.</v>

277
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:04.610
<v Speaker 4>That fucking made me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Made me laugh.</v>

278
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.900
<v Speaker 4>So God damn hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is months ago.</v>

279
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 4>This was before we knew anything about</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy.</v>

280
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:10.940
<v Speaker 4>I did it right after I knew about them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

281
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.260
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

282
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

283
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.100
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

284
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.960
<v Speaker 4>Louie did the thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

285
00:12:16.961 --> 00:12:18.580
<v Speaker 4>abortion that he opened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it,</v>

286
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

287
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.460
<v Speaker 4>they think they're killing babies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be out every day if that's what I</v>

288
00:12:24.461 --> 00:12:24.860
<v Speaker 4>thought.</v>

289
00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

290
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 4>I just don't see it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's the idea of like,</v>

291
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.380
<v Speaker 4>there's so many debates that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>won't admit any doubt about like an 80,</v>

292
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:38.350
<v Speaker 4>20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20% abortion,</v>

293
00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:39.363
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>

294
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.580
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have one probably.</v>

295
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:44.680
<v Speaker 4>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never had the privilege.</v>

296
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never needed to get one,</v>

297
00:12:47.111 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 4>but like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think if other people want to get</v>

298
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:50.554
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

299
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:52.180
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time,</v>

300
00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:54.460
<v Speaker 4>I see when I see what your argument is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

301
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:55.620
<v Speaker 4>I see both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

302
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.270
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a certain time where</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a baby,</v>

303
00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain,</v>

304
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certain amount of months in,</v>

305
00:13:01.181 --> 00:13:01.901
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

306
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 4>you're killing a baby now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know when it is,</v>

307
00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.390
<v Speaker 4>but I know what it is either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

308
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.740
<v Speaker 4>it's gotta be at some point tell you</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

309
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:12.430
<v Speaker 4>it's not the first day when it's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>two cells claiming together and they</v>

310
00:13:12.431 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Speaker 4>become four cells.</v>

311
00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.010
<v Speaker 4>Just get rid of the cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a wrap.</v>

312
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:17.770
<v Speaker 4>But you would even admit like I or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is,</v>

313
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.330
<v Speaker 4>maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

314
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.920
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

315
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 4>I personally don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a scientist.</v>

316
00:13:23.081 --> 00:13:25.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a uh,</v>

317
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

318
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 4>obstetrician.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if we had,</v>

319
00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:34.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a soul meter in the room and uh,</v>

320
00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.190
<v Speaker 4>like you woke up one day and your wife</v>
<v Speaker 4>was pregnant and it's like 48 days in</v>

321
00:13:39.191 --> 00:13:39.670
<v Speaker 4>honey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honey,</v>

322
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Speaker 4>look at the sole meter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a new,</v>

323
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:42.940
<v Speaker 4>so like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

324
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.770
<v Speaker 4>Yay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No turning back now.</v>

325
00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 4>Now it's an insole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

326
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Before then it was just like a nesting</v>
<v Speaker 4>area.</v>

327
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 4>Like they were ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a prepping area for a new soul.</v>

328
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.570
<v Speaker 4>You believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's at 48 days.</v>

329
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.550
<v Speaker 4>You're at one day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no soul if you,</v>

330
00:13:58.551 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 4>if you had a meter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

331
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.940
<v Speaker 4>If you had a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously we done this in a world where</v>

332
00:14:01.941 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 4>the robot president and a soul mate and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is all also in a world where would</v>

333
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:08.140
<v Speaker 4>they proven the existence of the soul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is just theoretical.</v>

334
00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you could,</v>

335
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.510
<v Speaker 4>if you had like a thing in the room with</v>
<v Speaker 4>you sorta like when you have a pregnancy</v>

336
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:16.720
<v Speaker 4>test or you check like look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's registering,</v>

337
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:20.020
<v Speaker 4>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's happening like a a sole meter.</v>

338
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have a countdown.</v>

339
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.860
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It says I'm pregnant,</v>

340
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.910
<v Speaker 4>we have 47 days or were pieces of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

341
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.360
<v Speaker 4>Because once the soul comes in</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] yeah.</v>

342
00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.210
<v Speaker 4>Then then we're murderers I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

343
00:14:34.211 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

344
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:37.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But and there are people that believe</v>

345
00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:38.980
<v Speaker 4>it's day one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

346
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.110
<v Speaker 4>I can understand how you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

347
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.120
<v Speaker 4>I don't even,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even,</v>

348
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.400
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't even say I don't believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

349
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have no,</v>

350
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.020
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any feeling one way or the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>

351
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 4>If you interview,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't interfere with the process</v>

352
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:56.780
<v Speaker 4>from day one and it goes all the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>through term,</v>

353
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:57.800
<v Speaker 4>you have a human.</v>

354
00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how can you make the argument that if</v>

355
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:01.520
<v Speaker 4>you do interfere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nothing.</v>

356
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:03.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like you're stopping a</v>

357
00:15:03.501 --> 00:15:05.010
<v Speaker 4>potential human,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something's,</v>

358
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:06.320
<v Speaker 4>something's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

359
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:07.890
<v Speaker 4>But it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the,</v>

360
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.890
<v Speaker 4>the foolishness of going like I am</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolute.</v>

361
00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

362
00:15:13.731 --> 00:15:17.420
<v Speaker 4>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just the reductionist idea of it</v>

363
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:21.550
<v Speaker 4>being just a bundle of cells too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so sort of preposterous to like,</v>

364
00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.210
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a bunch of cells that will be a</v>

365
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:28.010
<v Speaker 4>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you can't just deny the potential.</v>

366
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that a bunch of cells,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

367
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's any different than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

368
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 4>I think if you can show me for sure that</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's four cells,</v>

369
00:15:35.541 --> 00:15:39.770
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a complete total non issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's when you get into three months,</v>

370
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two months in three months and I'm like,</v>

371
00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:42.981
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

372
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

373
00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:45.400
<v Speaker 4>What is again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a baby,</v>

374
00:15:45.401 --> 00:15:46.220
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

375
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.660
<v Speaker 4>To you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your barometer.</v>

376
00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's the thing I was saying is</v>

377
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 4>like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not allowed to have a nuanced</v>

378
00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:55.100
<v Speaker 4>opinion anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just have to be like,</v>

379
00:15:55.101 --> 00:15:57.400
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am absolutely eh,</v>

380
00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.180
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you must believe all women.</v>

381
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:02.270
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that thing I posted the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other day about it was,</v>

382
00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the me too backlash is going to come.</v>

383
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:06.861
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

384
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how's it going to cut?</v>

385
00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:13.280
<v Speaker 4>What kind of backlash?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The backlash is the,</v>

386
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 4>on the on campus thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

387
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.620
<v Speaker 4>the basically like the Obama</v>
<v Speaker 4>administration and Joe Biden,</v>

388
00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>recommended these guidelines for title</v>

389
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.020
<v Speaker 4>nine and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they,</v>

390
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.170
<v Speaker 4>so they recommended these guidelines for</v>
<v Speaker 4>title nine,</v>

391
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:30.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the basically protecting women on</v>

392
00:16:30.321 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 4>college campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the problem is</v>

393
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 4>they throw out due process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like literally if a guy,</v>

394
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.130
<v Speaker 4>the idea is if your kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you get a Qs,</v>

395
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 4>you're basically convicted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy gets accused,</v>

396
00:16:43.821 --> 00:16:48.050
<v Speaker 4>he's thrown out of school and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's not due process.</v>

397
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.150
<v Speaker 4>There were all these things that were</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

398
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.000
<v Speaker 4>like I'd never thought about before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

399
00:16:53.001 --> 00:16:55.600
<v Speaker 4>cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to believe all,</v>

400
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>

401
00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 4>I want to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If a woman,</v>

402
00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe women have much reason</v>
<v Speaker 4>to lie about the shit.</v>

403
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:02.440
<v Speaker 4>See what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not not</v>

404
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.090
<v Speaker 3>true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe that at all because I</v>

405
00:17:04.091 --> 00:17:08.020
<v Speaker 3>believe there's a lot of women that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>grudges and they're angry and they want</v>

406
00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:10.930
<v Speaker 3>to make things up about man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I know men where that's happened too</v>

407
00:17:10.931 --> 00:17:13.360
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know men who have been falsely accused</v>

408
00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:16.870
<v Speaker 3>of rape and the one that dropped it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>told the police that she was just mad at</v>

409
00:17:16.871 --> 00:17:18.760
<v Speaker 3>him and she would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she had a vendetta.</v>

410
00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:20.710
<v Speaker 3>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen a lot.</v>

411
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.520
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it'll ever actually,</v>

412
00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:26.110
<v Speaker 3>victor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think that it's a minor.</v>

413
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just an [inaudible] or not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Kumi has said something that's</v>

414
00:17:29.921 --> 00:17:30.520
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>

415
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:35.520
<v Speaker 3>he goes calling all women liars is just</v>
<v Speaker 3>as crazy as saying all women to say the</v>

416
00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:36.514
<v Speaker 3>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

417
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

418
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.630
<v Speaker 3>You're going to have a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>percentage of human beings that are</v>

419
00:17:40.631 --> 00:17:43.150
<v Speaker 3>deceptive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why I say 97% of women are</v>

420
00:17:43.151 --> 00:17:44.350
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

421
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.490
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

422
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:46.781
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to,</v>

423
00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:48.910
<v Speaker 3>I don't even want to speculate about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the stats are.</v>

424
00:17:48.911 --> 00:17:50.460
<v Speaker 3>The is if you're a person</v>

425
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.430
<v Speaker 4>who didn't do anything to someone and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're accusing you of doing</v>

426
00:17:53.431 --> 00:17:54.870
<v Speaker 4>something to them and then it ruins your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life,</v>

427
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:57.360
<v Speaker 4>that's devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that happens.</v>

428
00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:02.340
<v Speaker 4>So I been having this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I posted it and I put on twitter,</v>

429
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:03.750
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm wrong,</v>

430
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.700
<v Speaker 4>if this is wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yell at me here.</v>

431
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was surprised by how few people</v>

432
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 4>yelled.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one really got mad because when you</v>

433
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:17.361
<v Speaker 4>see what the recommendations were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people believe in due process and the</v>

434
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:18.520
<v Speaker 4>rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they should.</v>

435
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.880
<v Speaker 4>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people know that mob mentalities are not</v>

436
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.150
<v Speaker 4>good and they're not American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're not the spirit of</v>

437
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:27.984
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're there.</v>

438
00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.560
<v Speaker 4>They are pretty American actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like the,</v>

439
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.450
<v Speaker 4>they're not the letter of America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

440
00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:38.930
<v Speaker 4>and it was kind of baffling that Obama</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the administration,</v>

441
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 4>so what's happening is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so guys are getting kicked out of</v>

442
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:44.170
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>

443
00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:46.020
<v Speaker 4>They're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what these,</v>

444
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.970
<v Speaker 4>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the colleges are following the</v>

445
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:52.770
<v Speaker 4>guidelines and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two processes thrown away.</v>

446
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.140
<v Speaker 4>Guys get thrown out of school to Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>

447
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:55.590
<v Speaker 4>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dah.</v>

448
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.170
<v Speaker 4>And then they sue the school and guess</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

449
00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.970
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them are winning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

450
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 4>Because it's unconstitutional what the</v>
<v Speaker 4>school did.</v>

451
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.910
<v Speaker 4>So it's this weird thing of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

452
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.720
<v Speaker 4>it's such a fucking sticky situation</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I was taught,</v>

453
00:19:09.721 --> 00:19:11.520
<v Speaker 4>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after I posted,</v>

454
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:16.521
<v Speaker 4>a few female friends of mine texted or</v>
<v Speaker 4>called me and one of them said,</v>

455
00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:22.330
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that she was at Nyu and was having sex</v>

456
00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:25.920
<v Speaker 4>with a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He tried to,</v>

457
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.200
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it in her ass.</v>

458
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.460
<v Speaker 4>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

459
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.170
<v Speaker 4>She said No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

460
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.610
<v Speaker 4>can I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said No.</v>

461
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he did anyway,</v>

462
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.720
<v Speaker 4>she just froze and was like stunned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>frozen,</v>

463
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.780
<v Speaker 4>silent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He finishes no alcohol.</v>

464
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.240
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

465
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.510
<v Speaker 4>and it just becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

466
00:19:45.511 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 4>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like,</v>

467
00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:52.740
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what should we do in a society about a</v>

468
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:55.080
<v Speaker 4>situation like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I truly don't know.</v>

469
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.420
<v Speaker 4>I truly am like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no fucking idea.</v>

470
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if she said no and he did it anyway,</v>

471
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.440
<v Speaker 4>that's a real fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

472
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.470
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

473
00:20:04.690 --> 00:20:05.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>

474
00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.140
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what,</v>

475
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.670
<v Speaker 4>but also then it just becomes what it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

476
00:20:11.671 --> 00:20:14.250
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she said thing there's no,</v>

477
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.820
<v Speaker 4>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

478
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:17.730
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

479
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:21.450
<v Speaker 4>Like he real lie detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's really the situations like</v>

480
00:20:21.451 --> 00:20:23.400
<v Speaker 4>this where it's one person's word</v>
<v Speaker 4>against the other and the,</v>

481
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.830
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the results critical.</v>

482
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.980
<v Speaker 4>You gotta I dunno if that's really</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible though.</v>

483
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know of anything that exists or</v>

484
00:20:31.591 --> 00:20:34.500
<v Speaker 4>any technology that's on the pipeline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

485
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.230
<v Speaker 4>there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a friend of mine jokingly said that,</v>

486
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:38.203
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

487
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 4>all guys and women need to wear body</v>
<v Speaker 4>cams.</v>

488
00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:43.630
<v Speaker 4>Like cops.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

489
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of where it is.</v>

490
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Because again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is one of the like,</v>

491
00:20:48.371 --> 00:20:51.970
<v Speaker 4>Shit I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it might be you kind of think</v>

492
00:20:51.971 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

493
00:20:53.021 --> 00:20:53.920
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably,</v>

494
00:20:53.921 --> 00:20:54.780
<v Speaker 4>it's always pretty cut and dried.</v>

495
00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

496
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:55.710
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

497
00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.490
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you hear a thing like that and</v>

498
00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:58.870
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

499
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then no one's going to shoot that</v>

500
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:04.510
<v Speaker 4>guy get to be on camera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

501
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:10.020
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the now we're into like,</v>

502
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 4>because I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh guys shouldn't get kicked out of</v>

503
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:14.590
<v Speaker 4>school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There should be due process.</v>

504
00:21:14.591 --> 00:21:17.830
<v Speaker 4>Of course there should be due process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I hear a story like that and I'm</v>

505
00:21:17.831 --> 00:21:19.480
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>

506
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:20.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

507
00:21:20.681 --> 00:21:22.570
<v Speaker 4>maybe that guy shouldn't be able to go</v>
<v Speaker 4>to school.</v>

508
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I truly,</v>

509
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he lied and he said that didn't</v>

510
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:28.120
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't,</v>

511
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.190
<v Speaker 4>she didn't press charges or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

512
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

513
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:32.710
<v Speaker 4>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super common.</v>

514
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 4>So when you take into account rape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the number of rapes that get reported</v>

515
00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.100
<v Speaker 4>versus the number of rapes that don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>get reported,</v>

516
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 4>it's like it's a drop in the bucket.</v>

517
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.981
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when,</v>

518
00:21:41.981 --> 00:21:42.820
<v Speaker 4>when guys go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

519
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.740
<v Speaker 4>why don't girls report it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>

520
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.830
<v Speaker 4>you don't like going to jury duty and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a week you want it.</v>

521
00:21:50.501 --> 00:21:53.710
<v Speaker 4>You think a girl wants to talk about her</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking vagina for a year and a half.</v>

522
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.890
<v Speaker 4>Not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stigma of running around knowing</v>

523
00:21:56.891 --> 00:22:00.040
<v Speaker 4>that everybody knows you were raped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like having that feeling where people</v>

524
00:22:00.041 --> 00:22:03.790
<v Speaker 4>are judging you or staring yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Talking about you for nothing that you</v>

525
00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:04.624
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

526
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:08.470
<v Speaker 4>It's like literally as these things</v>
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

527
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you read these,</v>

528
00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.120
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the times the,</v>

529
00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:15.160
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it feels like the choice for women is as</v>

530
00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:16.780
<v Speaker 4>it's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

531
00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:19.060
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to make my life about this now.</v>

532
00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:22.420
<v Speaker 4>My whole life has to be about this for</v>
<v Speaker 4>at least a year and a half.</v>

533
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Cops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lawyers,</v>

534
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:25.650
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

535
00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:31.050
<v Speaker 4>court dates all just like a nightmare</v>
<v Speaker 4>nightmare that you likely did.</v>

536
00:22:32.261 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Nothing wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

537
00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:35.530
<v Speaker 4>And you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and now it's like getting,</v>

538
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:40.400
<v Speaker 4>it's like getting an a in a horrible car</v>
<v Speaker 4>accident or something that,</v>

539
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.930
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the solution is</v>

540
00:22:46.931 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 4>because as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my first and being contrary and I go</v>

541
00:22:49.691 --> 00:22:49.921
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

542
00:22:49.921 --> 00:22:50.800
<v Speaker 4>what did you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what did they do?</v>

543
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.640
<v Speaker 4>What do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the,</v>

544
00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.750
<v Speaker 4>all the things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

545
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of these things are a wrong place</v>

546
00:22:57.551 --> 00:23:00.940
<v Speaker 4>at the wrong time with a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

547
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

548
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.010
<v Speaker 4>due process is significant though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gigantic.</v>

549
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.730
<v Speaker 4>I know I to have it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know happened with the Uva case in</v>

550
00:23:12.731 --> 00:23:16.420
<v Speaker 4>Rolling Stone magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They printed this stupid fucking lie,</v>

551
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.750
<v Speaker 4>this crazy story that really becomes a</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem because there's real rape going</v>

552
00:23:22.751 --> 00:23:25.430
<v Speaker 4>on all the time on campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's happened.</v>

553
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.400
<v Speaker 4>I for that that girl wasn't raped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The UVA store.</v>

554
00:23:28.401 --> 00:23:30.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that she was raped.</v>

555
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

556
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:36.910
<v Speaker 4>it was the 15 like the way something</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened,</v>

557
00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.920
<v Speaker 4>something you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

558
00:23:38.921 --> 00:23:40.730
<v Speaker 4>What do you think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think they paved that she</v>

559
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.260
<v Speaker 4>wasn't even there and that she was never</v>
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>

560
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:47.710
<v Speaker 4>There was no water or any of that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me Maybe then it maybe didn't read out</v>

561
00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:48.880
<v Speaker 4>any follow up.</v>

562
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.620
<v Speaker 3>I think the significant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

563
00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:54.010
<v Speaker 3>there's so much evidence pointing to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that it was all made up.</v>

564
00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That does very little possibility that</v>

565
00:23:56.321 --> 00:23:58.990
<v Speaker 3>something actually happened to her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they've completely dismissed</v>

566
00:23:58.991 --> 00:24:01.000
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they think it was just a girl</v>

567
00:24:01.001 --> 00:24:04.330
<v Speaker 3>just made some crazy shit up versus the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mattress girl thing.</v>

568
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.780
<v Speaker 3>The mattress girl one was a weird one</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she definitely had sex with that</v>

569
00:24:07.781 --> 00:24:09.760
<v Speaker 3>guy and she definitely wanted to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex.</v>

570
00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:13.210
<v Speaker 3>That guy cause she was messaging him</v>
<v Speaker 3>about sex and about,</v>

571
00:24:13.211 --> 00:24:16.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she said something about bring</v>

572
00:24:16.151 --> 00:24:20.050
<v Speaker 3>condoms and you're going to put it in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>butt and just a bunch of crazy shit.</v>

573
00:24:20.051 --> 00:24:21.760
<v Speaker 3>Like it was sex talk back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

574
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:27.240
<v Speaker 3>And then she just decided this is an</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing way to be a martyr and to be a</v>

575
00:24:27.911 --> 00:24:30.310
<v Speaker 3>victim and to bring that fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>mattress everywhere,</v>

576
00:24:30.311 --> 00:24:32.380
<v Speaker 3>including at a commencement speech.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

577
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:33.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

578
00:24:33.581 --> 00:24:36.550
<v Speaker 3>that's a different sort of case that kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>is now suing.</v>

579
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.430
<v Speaker 3>That kid is now suing the university and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope he wins.</v>

580
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:40.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I again,</v>

581
00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:45.901
<v Speaker 4>I hope he wins and because I think due</v>
<v Speaker 4>process is as important.</v>

582
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.940
<v Speaker 4>It's literally a tie for first between,</v>

583
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:50.243
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

584
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.110
<v Speaker 4>protecting women and protecting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>constitution.</v>

585
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.250
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but</v>

586
00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:57.541
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

587
00:24:57.541 --> 00:24:58.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't even the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

588
00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:03.950
<v Speaker 4>the thing that bothers me about even</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about Uva or Colombia is it</v>

589
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.110
<v Speaker 4>makes the story about lying women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

590
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.430
<v Speaker 4>Which is just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not that they're the outliers.</v>

591
00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:11.960
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are the outliers,</v>

592
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:14.030
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by an extreme because there are the</v>

593
00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:17.240
<v Speaker 4>outliers must be able to come forward</v>
<v Speaker 4>ration when you can't just completely</v>

594
00:25:17.241 --> 00:25:18.580
<v Speaker 4>ignore them in the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

595
00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.880
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the why you need to process</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is exactly what you need.</v>

596
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we also have to stop thinking of it as</v>

597
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:26.450
<v Speaker 4>like men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's human beings,</v>

598
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.510
<v Speaker 4>human beings involved in these</v>
<v Speaker 4>situations and we have to treat them</v>

599
00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:31.640
<v Speaker 4>like equals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the story about Occidental?</v>

600
00:25:31.641 --> 00:25:33.520
<v Speaker 4>Occidental College in La?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

601
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:34.460
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which story?</v>

602
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:38.000
<v Speaker 3>Boy and girl get drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>text each other back and forth.</v>

603
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you have condoms?</v>

604
00:25:39.471 --> 00:25:40.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on over.</v>

605
00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.160
<v Speaker 3>She comes over there where they have sex</v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other.</v>

606
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then her friends convinced her that</v>

607
00:25:46.191 --> 00:25:49.550
<v Speaker 3>because she was drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she could not consent and that it's</v>

608
00:25:49.551 --> 00:25:50.091
<v Speaker 3>rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

609
00:25:50.091 --> 00:25:51.920
<v Speaker 3>Remember that was a big thing for awhile</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you,</v>

610
00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:53.390
<v Speaker 3>if you're not drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't consent.</v>

611
00:25:53.391 --> 00:25:56.610
<v Speaker 3>And it was like for a year or two they</v>
<v Speaker 3>tried to push that until they realize,</v>

612
00:25:56.611 --> 00:25:58.340
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes everyone a rapist.</v>

613
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.030
<v Speaker 4>So they can mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>having said that,</v>

614
00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:06.060
<v Speaker 4>I think that the part that alcohol plays</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this shit giant is so fucking massive</v>

615
00:26:08.561 --> 00:26:10.960
<v Speaker 4>and nobody ever brings it up as giant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

616
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.180
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if alcohol was complicit in all the</v>

617
00:26:13.181 --> 00:26:16.120
<v Speaker 4>things that people did while drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the same way that prescription drugs,</v>

618
00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:16.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'd be out of business,</v>

619
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:20.830
<v Speaker 4>out of business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this guy and this gal have some sex</v>

620
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.860
<v Speaker 4>and it's consensual 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But after the fact,</v>

621
00:26:23.861 --> 00:26:26.770
<v Speaker 4>her friends tell her you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>consent because you were drunk.</v>

622
00:26:26.771 --> 00:26:28.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So even though he was drunk too,</v>

623
00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.220
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

624
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:33.980
<v Speaker 3>people get told,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the authorities get involved.</v>

625
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:35.660
<v Speaker 3>He gets kicked out of cool out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

626
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:39.020
<v Speaker 3>She does not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just said they don't call it rape.</v>

627
00:26:39.021 --> 00:26:41.840
<v Speaker 3>They don't press charges.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do anything actually wrong,</v>

628
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the,</v>

629
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 3>of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since</v>

630
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 1>they're both intoxicated in willing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consensual,</v>

631
00:26:46.651 --> 00:26:49.500
<v Speaker 1>but they kick him out of college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's like,</v>

632
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:50.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man,</v>

633
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:52.680
<v Speaker 1>she's drunk too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I got raped as well.</v>

634
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that you can't just be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man that is doing the raping if</v>

635
00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you're both intoxicated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

636
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.820
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck am I supposed to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consent?</v>

637
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:04.970
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that this is as much of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>male versus female thing.</v>

638
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.660
<v Speaker 2>I had a conversation with a female</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of mine recently,</v>

639
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:14.110
<v Speaker 2>and the conclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the conclusions was men don't see</v>

640
00:27:14.571 --> 00:27:18.740
<v Speaker 2>women as humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

641
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Meaning there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And while they are here,</v>

642
00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:21.813
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

643
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:23.860
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

644
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.300
<v Speaker 2>let their other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

645
00:27:25.301 --> 00:27:27.490
<v Speaker 2>there it's other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's other.</v>

646
00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.180
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you're not a human,</v>

647
00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.460
<v Speaker 2>but you're not a man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

648
00:27:33.461 --> 00:27:36.640
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some thing of like the way</v>

649
00:27:36.641 --> 00:27:41.641
<v Speaker 2>men treat women is not equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so it's other,</v>

650
00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.320
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're in this other category,</v>

651
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.840
<v Speaker 1>don't understand them that much because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not one of them.</v>

652
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

653
00:27:47.831 --> 00:27:49.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't have a good relationship</v>

654
00:27:49.091 --> 00:27:50.380
<v Speaker 1>with her mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even worse.</v>

655
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:53.080
<v Speaker 1>And especially if they were raised by</v>
<v Speaker 1>their dad alone,</v>

656
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.030
<v Speaker 1>those guys are the sketchiest guys of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

657
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm generalizing.</v>

658
00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't even think of one guy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

659
00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I know when it goes like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

660
00:28:00.761 --> 00:28:01.594
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

661
00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.420
<v Speaker 1>I know a guy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

662
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.820
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes even guys that were only</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised by their mom or sketchy if their</v>

663
00:28:06.821 --> 00:28:08.560
<v Speaker 1>mom hates women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

664
00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.110
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

665
00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.260
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just real hard when you start doing</v>

666
00:28:14.261 --> 00:28:16.060
<v Speaker 1>this men and women thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

667
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

668
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.510
<v Speaker 1>you're prone to generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just no getting away from it.</v>

669
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:24.190
<v Speaker 1>But men want sex from women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they pursuing women.</v>

670
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:26.860
<v Speaker 1>And do you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know any men that are,</v>

671
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.700
<v Speaker 1>that you're friends with that you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time to become more and more bitter</v>

672
00:28:30.701 --> 00:28:34.150
<v Speaker 1>towards women because they be getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected over and over and the associate</v>

673
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.630
<v Speaker 1>women with bad feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Associate Women with negativity.</v>

674
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:42.070
<v Speaker 1>I think men look at women like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're trying to score on a team,</v>

675
00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

676
00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.550
<v Speaker 2>it's dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's first base,</v>

677
00:28:45.551 --> 00:28:46.570
<v Speaker 2>second base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>third base.</v>

678
00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:50.650
<v Speaker 2>It's literally like built into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>language of how we,</v>

679
00:28:50.651 --> 00:28:54.850
<v Speaker 2>it is a thing that guys conquer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it ends up being,</v>

680
00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.453
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

681
00:28:56.910 --> 00:29:00.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liken it in the past to like Saudi</v>

682
00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Arabia or like fucking towel heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because they won't give us the</v>

683
00:29:04.511 --> 00:29:05.860
<v Speaker 2>fucking oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

684
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:06.580
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

685
00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.740
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't like you.</v>

686
00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.660
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to give you like they</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't what they are,</v>

687
00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.550
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty any more than it means your</v>

688
00:29:15.551 --> 00:29:18.380
<v Speaker 2>shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't want this fucking Kombucha,</v>

689
00:29:18.381 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 2>it like you just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body didn't want it.</v>

690
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:23.380
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that her body doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want you like theirs,</v>

691
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:27.190
<v Speaker 2>but it makes guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hurts their feelings and it makes</v>

692
00:29:27.191 --> 00:29:27.690
<v Speaker 2>them crazy.</v>

693
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.990
<v Speaker 1>And it also deals with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary mechanisms that are</v>

694
00:29:30.991 --> 00:29:33.120
<v Speaker 1>designed to make sure that we breed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

695
00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it becomes like a significant issue for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to figure out how do I get this</v>

696
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:39.360
<v Speaker 1>gal to like me to the point where she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to have sex with me.</v>

697
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to buy the right cars.</v>

698
00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 1>I got rather where the right watch.</v>

699
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.060
<v Speaker 3>I got to do this and do that and say the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right things and be a gentleman and hold</v>

700
00:29:46.061 --> 00:29:47.920
<v Speaker 3>open doors and all these things that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

701
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:48.431
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

702
00:29:48.431 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 3>why don't men hold open doors do have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a gentlemen.</v>

703
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.320
<v Speaker 3>No t did show that there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>preferential mate.</v>

704
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.480
<v Speaker 3>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to con you.</v>

705
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And to taking that Dick.</v>

706
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:58.040
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

707
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.990
<v Speaker 4>it's goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>speaks to your bit about invention.</v>

708
00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that,</v>

709
00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:07.020
<v Speaker 4>that your invention thing now is that</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason,</v>

710
00:30:07.021 --> 00:30:11.220
<v Speaker 4>the thing of like why women have an</v>
<v Speaker 4>advantage because they don't have to,</v>

711
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.670
<v Speaker 4>they don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's also the way their mind works,</v>

712
00:30:14.671 --> 00:30:16.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hunter gatherer mindset,</v>

713
00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.750
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very different with the females and the</v>

714
00:30:18.751 --> 00:30:20.770
<v Speaker 4>tribe versus the males.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're stealing,</v>

715
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:22.260
<v Speaker 4>still dealing with the echoes of all</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

716
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.030
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for people that are,</v>

717
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shallow.</v>

718
00:30:25.711 --> 00:30:29.340
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about misogyny right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just so you know,</v>

719
00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:33.360
<v Speaker 4>we're talking in theory about misogyny</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these are not views that either of</v>

720
00:30:33.361 --> 00:30:34.110
<v Speaker 4>us home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

721
00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:35.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

722
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.730
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

723
00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:37.080
<v Speaker 3>in fact the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

724
00:30:37.081 --> 00:30:38.670
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have all daughters,</v>

725
00:30:38.671 --> 00:30:41.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm used to being around little girls.</v>

726
00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.330
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know about women more now and</v>

727
00:30:45.331 --> 00:30:46.620
<v Speaker 3>understand them than I ever did.</v>

728
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.600
<v Speaker 4>And how would you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how would you,</v>

729
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:55.560
<v Speaker 4>how different would your behavior have</v>
<v Speaker 4>been 20 years ago if you had what you,</v>

730
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.260
<v Speaker 4>the wisdom you have now from having a</v>
<v Speaker 4>way different,</v>

731
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.290
<v Speaker 3>it would be way different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just would maybe might behave.</v>

732
00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.020
<v Speaker 3>I never did anything horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

733
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:07.740
<v Speaker 3>like my record is clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

734
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.700
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking about assault,</v>

735
00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:14.940
<v Speaker 3>but what I am,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I am more aware of now is the inner</v>

736
00:31:15.071 --> 00:31:19.810
<v Speaker 3>workings of like a female from child to</v>
<v Speaker 3>adulthood.</v>

737
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:25.080
<v Speaker 3>I understand that they're just so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a different evolutionary path</v>

738
00:31:26.231 --> 00:31:28.330
<v Speaker 3>for their sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their gender.</v>

739
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 3>There's a whole thing going on that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to protect the nest.</v>

740
00:31:32.231 --> 00:31:34.600
<v Speaker 3>They want to find a man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a lot of guys that look at</v>

741
00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:37.480
<v Speaker 3>a girl who wants a successful guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

742
00:31:37.481 --> 00:31:39.910
<v Speaker 3>she's fucking shallow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just wants a bunch of shoots.</v>

743
00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:44.290
<v Speaker 3>You want someone to pay for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there is a evolutionary path where</v>

744
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:49.150
<v Speaker 3>the woman is looking for a man who shows</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he is capable of taking care of</v>

745
00:31:49.151 --> 00:31:53.740
<v Speaker 3>things while she is held up being</v>
<v Speaker 3>pregnant and taking care of the young.</v>

746
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:57.700
<v Speaker 3>It is a natural instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is undeniable and there are some</v>

747
00:31:57.701 --> 00:32:01.510
<v Speaker 3>women that are super strong and super</v>
<v Speaker 3>motivated and they don't have that</v>

748
00:32:01.511 --> 00:32:04.060
<v Speaker 3>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their instinct is to just have a kid,</v>

749
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.400
<v Speaker 3>give it to a nanny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get back to work as quick as possible.</v>

750
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.350
<v Speaker 4>What I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet their husband's tall.</v>

751
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.860
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's still those things of like the</v>

752
00:32:12.861 --> 00:32:17.060
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary shit that you can't get rid</v>
<v Speaker 4>of your body and wants to fuck a tall</v>

753
00:32:17.061 --> 00:32:19.880
<v Speaker 4>guy for the same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for protection,</v>

754
00:32:19.881 --> 00:32:20.530
<v Speaker 4>all that shit</v>

755
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.640
<v Speaker 3>for all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Money tight strength provision.</v>

756
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:25.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

757
00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.070
<v Speaker 3>and the ability to overcome significant</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations.</v>

758
00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.970
<v Speaker 3>Like whenever there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a God that falls apart under stress</v>

759
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.580
<v Speaker 3>is one of the most unattractive things</v>
<v Speaker 3>to women ever.</v>

760
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:39.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a study where like that I</v>

761
00:32:39.411 --> 00:32:40.100
<v Speaker 4>think winning,</v>

762
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.120
<v Speaker 1>I have talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

763
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.540
<v Speaker 1>where guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women don't like when guys cry in front</v>

764
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:46.280
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say they want an emotional guy.</v>

765
00:32:46.281 --> 00:32:49.370
<v Speaker 1>What they mean is I want you to listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my emotions.</v>

766
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:54.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to be emotional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need you to be a fucking marine and</v>

767
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be emotional and cry</v>
<v Speaker 1>about things.</v>

768
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.910
<v Speaker 1>It better be like a brave display of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

769
00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.140
<v Speaker 1>One of your fallen brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

770
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

771
00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 1>There's somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

772
00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.880
<v Speaker 1>like a baseball players retiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

773
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.800
<v Speaker 1>some physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some physical thing about the passage of</v>

774
00:33:09.801 --> 00:33:11.390
<v Speaker 1>time in brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

775
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:12.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's it.</v>

776
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.530
<v Speaker 1>That's my daughter's birthday party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so happy.</v>

777
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

778
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.490
<v Speaker 1>that's the portfolio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ability to respond to pressures,</v>

780
00:33:22.821 --> 00:33:25.970
<v Speaker 1>a giant one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to provide is a giant one.</v>

781
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Physical features like having strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>features,</v>

782
00:33:29.331 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 1>but having strong genetics.</v>

783
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:34.700
<v Speaker 1>The woman has to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like genetically has to feel like she's</v>

784
00:33:34.701 --> 00:33:37.610
<v Speaker 1>being protected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some women that don't</v>

785
00:33:37.611 --> 00:33:40.280
<v Speaker 1>like that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some women that like bitch men</v>

786
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:42.630
<v Speaker 1>and we know those women and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

787
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:46.520
<v Speaker 1>they're the really domineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful women and they have these men</v>

788
00:33:46.521 --> 00:33:50.500
<v Speaker 1>that are like quiet and there's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiring.</v>

789
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:52.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

790
00:33:52.571 --> 00:33:55.010
<v Speaker 1>that's okay too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these,</v>

791
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:59.150
<v Speaker 1>these patterns that exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they exist because for the longest time,</v>

792
00:33:59.390 --> 00:33:59.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

793
00:33:59.781 --> 00:34:03.200
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird situation where a woman has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be pregnant for nine months.</v>

794
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.620
<v Speaker 1>That's a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine picking a man.</v>

795
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a man and you're picking a woman</v>

796
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:12.480
<v Speaker 1>and you have to decide when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting this woman is this chicken to be</v>

797
00:34:12.481 --> 00:34:14.990
<v Speaker 1>able to keep it together with me while</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm held up,</v>

798
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:20.200
<v Speaker 1>literally held up for a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a whole year for one year I'm going</v>

799
00:34:20.681 --> 00:34:25.681
<v Speaker 1>to be stuck in this situation and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>from then the next 18 years I'm going to</v>

800
00:34:25.941 --> 00:34:29.510
<v Speaker 1>be responsible for the infant that comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of this union.</v>

801
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so different than our thought</v>

802
00:34:32.061 --> 00:34:33.860
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so different.</v>

803
00:34:33.861 --> 00:34:38.180
<v Speaker 1>The consequences are smashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men only think about it.</v>

804
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:40.730
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men want sex.</v>

805
00:34:40.910 --> 00:34:44.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally and then it's just blah</v>

806
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.650
<v Speaker 1>and then it's just black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

807
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like sex and then just like black</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the distance.</v>

808
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Infinite blackness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas women do things,</v>

809
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:55.900
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a more intricate decision having</v>

810
00:34:56.151 --> 00:34:59.510
<v Speaker 1>sex with somebody cause it is like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>long term shit.</v>

811
00:34:59.511 --> 00:35:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Where's we'd just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just want the baby comes out of this.</v>

812
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one I'm looking for.</v>

813
00:35:05.581 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 1>That's when I'm just looking to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

814
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:10.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women are looking for sex too,</v>

815
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:13.970
<v Speaker 1>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good percentage of them at least are</v>

816
00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:17.930
<v Speaker 1>looking to be a mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that they want.</v>

817

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.380
<v Speaker 4>usually got to come see it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] tonight.</v>

936
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.860
<v Speaker 4>I'd love for you to come.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

937
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.570
<v Speaker 4>would you like to introduce me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

938
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:27.070
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

939
00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do,</v>

940
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.850
<v Speaker 4>sex is the most consequential thing we</v>
<v Speaker 4>can do with our bodies.</v>

941
00:40:30.851 --> 00:40:33.810
<v Speaker 4>So we can't talk about it beforehand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we just have to get like,</v>

942
00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:35.290
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you thinking what I'm thinking if</v>

943
00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:40.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm wrong and going to jail sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's this huge thing,</v>

944
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.890
<v Speaker 4>but we can't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it wasn't a huge thing in terms of</v>

945
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:48.280
<v Speaker 4>like the communication aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Until recently.</v>

946
00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:53.110
<v Speaker 4>I mean in the 1970s in 1986 people did a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of talking before they fucked.</v>

947
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.030
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

948
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:58.840
<v Speaker 4>but I also think that there were women</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't have as many rights.</v>

949
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.210
<v Speaker 4>I think now that women are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

950
00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.250
<v Speaker 4>women want sex too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

951
00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.410
<v Speaker 4>Three man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we met each other and they start</v>

952
00:41:05.411 --> 00:41:07.450
<v Speaker 4>making out and next thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're grabbing,</v>

953
00:41:07.451 --> 00:41:09.580
<v Speaker 4>Dick says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm of the mind though,</v>

954
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.720
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

955
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.970
<v Speaker 4>were women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

956
00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.270
<v Speaker 4>it's in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

957
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.580
<v Speaker 4>in my understanding of women's nature</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Faye want mystery and they want</v>

958
00:41:18.581 --> 00:41:22.030
<v Speaker 4>spontaneity as part of the package of</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex.</v>

959
00:41:22.031 --> 00:41:23.980
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what literally turns them on.</v>

960
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mystery.</v>

961
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:29.590
<v Speaker 4>Mr. Mills mask like a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got one,</v>

962
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:30.870
<v Speaker 4>he got one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should get a case.</v>

963
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:33.260
<v Speaker 4>Remember it tells all joke that's women</v>
<v Speaker 4>love mystery,</v>

964
00:41:33.261 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 4>which is why whenever</v>

965
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.350
<v Speaker 2>my girlfriend leaves the room I'd take a</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit and one of her shoes,</v>

966
00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:41.430
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell literally has a great one liner for</v>

967
00:41:41.431 --> 00:41:44.280
<v Speaker 2>every occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So funny.</v>

968
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

969
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.240
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

970
00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:53.140
<v Speaker 2>so it's built in to want mystery so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't,</v>

971
00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:55.460
<v Speaker 2>we literally can't talk about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>beforehand.</v>

972
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 2>You ever tried to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever go,</v>

973
00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.450
<v Speaker 2>you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

974
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:01.610
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to go have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you have to go like let's go look at</v>

975
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:03.260
<v Speaker 2>my stamps or whatever that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

976
00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Whatever euphemistic thing you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey come up and look at my mattress,</v>

977
00:42:07.641 --> 00:42:09.320

978
00:42:09.321 --> 00:42:11.300
<v Speaker 2>whatever your fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever your,</v>

979
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:15.110
<v Speaker 2>your ruse to get her up there because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say you want to have sex.</v>

980
00:42:15.111 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like about shame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it's a lot of,</v>

981
00:42:17.751 --> 00:42:20.270
<v Speaker 2>it's the mystery thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then there's also like women can't</v>

982
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 2>openly go like,</v>

1025
00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.600
<v Speaker 2>cause I know once I sleep with somebody</v>

<v Speaker 2>friends and I haven't talked about where</v>

1030
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 2>you sleep with somebody cause you can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of an excuse not to,</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1039

<v Speaker 2>once you're locked and loaded and yet</v>

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:20.710
<v Speaker 2>It's looking at horses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1051
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:21.330
<v Speaker 2>there are there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1052
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.460
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of things from Horst</v>
<v Speaker 2>Times.</v>

1053
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big one.</v>

1054
00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:26.640
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1055
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:29.520
<v Speaker 2>but so there is a thing of like just</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1056
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.320
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1057
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.240
<v Speaker 2>that's where male nature comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1058
00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Male nature doesn't lightweighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Middle Nature does not like waiting male</v>

1059
00:45:36.871 --> 00:45:41.871
<v Speaker 2>nature's not like patient male nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>also is a testosterone itself.</v>

1060
00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:46.710
<v Speaker 2>B gets risky behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1061
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.790
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it ends up in crime.</v>

1062
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:55.170
<v Speaker 2>Some it ends up in fucking in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1063
00:45:55.171 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 2>electricity or the Wright brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1064
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like just harnessing it for the</v>

1065
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:05.700
<v Speaker 2>right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1066
00:46:05.701 --> 00:46:09.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like the cause that like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the male character is,</v>

1067
00:46:09.631 --> 00:46:12.180
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of it is some of the shit is</v>

1068
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:13.014
<v Speaker 2>toxic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1069
00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:17.750
<v Speaker 1>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it a lot of ways is power and with power</v>

1070
00:46:17.751 --> 00:46:19.700
<v Speaker 1>comes responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1071
00:46:19.701 --> 00:46:21.980
<v Speaker 1>but I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean it's power like that</v>

1072
00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.850
<v Speaker 1>estrogen is in power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a fuel to testosterone,</v>

1073
00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when you have testosterone,</v>

1074
00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:32.540
<v Speaker 1>what it's doing is it's providing you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of ambition,</v>

1075
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:35.990
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of lust.</v>

1076
00:46:35.991 --> 00:46:37.610
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that though,</v>

1077
00:46:37.611 --> 00:46:41.540
<v Speaker 1>that's the mechanism that a lot of menus</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get things going in their life.</v>

1078
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:42.950
<v Speaker 1>And some guys don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
00:46:42.951 --> 00:46:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of men who are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive testosterone males who are</v>

1080
00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:51.050
<v Speaker 1>just chasing pussy and not doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything with their lives and they've,</v>

1081
00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.470
<v Speaker 1>they've become addicted to that and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a major distraction.</v>

1082
00:46:54.471 --> 00:46:56.780
<v Speaker 1>And usually their career suffers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1083
00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually those guys,</v>

1084
00:46:58.461 --> 00:47:00.080
<v Speaker 1>they're their careers in the shitter.</v>

1085
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:03.200
<v Speaker 2>I think we may be thinking of the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth and problem.</v>

1086
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know a lot of guys like that.</v>

1087
00:47:06.711 --> 00:47:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1088

<v Speaker 2>we talk about this shit constantly.</v>

1095
00:47:23.041 --> 00:47:26.340
<v Speaker 2>I was like,W men want power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1096
00:47:26.850 --> 00:47:28.260
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want to dominate.</v>

1097
00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:30.250
<v Speaker 2>Like that's our thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to expand the,</v>

1098
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I gotta you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like that's capitalism.</v>

1099
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:34.160
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1100
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:36.070
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1101
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:37.640
<v Speaker 2>empire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's everything.</v>

1102
00:47:37.641 --> 00:47:38.680
<v Speaker 2>It's just expand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expand,</v>

1103
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:39.401
<v Speaker 2>expand power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

1104
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:40.060
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

1105
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.790
<v Speaker 2>And it's like men want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the scarface thing.</v>

1106
00:47:42.791 --> 00:47:44.830
<v Speaker 2>First you get the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get power,</v>

1107
00:47:44.831 --> 00:47:46.810
<v Speaker 2>then you get the women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1108
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:48.850
<v Speaker 2>what dude?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do Women want power?</v>

1109
00:47:48.851 --> 00:47:49.870
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1110
00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 2>they don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women want control,</v>

1111
00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.680
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they don't want empire.</v>

1112
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.630
<v Speaker 2>They want you</v>

1113
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to be able to depend on you.</v>

1114
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For,</v>

1115
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I think fear is fine depending on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1116
00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we're going back to those natural</v>

1117
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:15.190
<v Speaker 1>instincts that a mother needs the father</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the one who's going to watch over</v>

1118
00:48:15.191 --> 00:48:16.970
<v Speaker 1>her and provide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1119
00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.150
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that sounds sexist,</v>

1120
00:48:19.151 --> 00:48:20.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't like that.</v>

1121
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the woman doesn't need demand to provide</v>

1122
00:48:21.581 --> 00:48:22.720
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

1123
00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:23.830
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

1124
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:26.260
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that women aren't equal</v>

1125
00:48:26.261 --> 00:48:27.970
<v Speaker 1>to men in terms of their ability to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1126
00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:31.210
<v Speaker 1>But what I am saying is there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain inherent instincts that we have</v>

1127
00:48:31.211 --> 00:48:32.930
<v Speaker 1>that are leftover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1128
00:48:32.931 --> 00:48:35.830
<v Speaker 1>And there's also like a lot of weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

1129
00:48:36.490 --> 00:48:39.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like with this domination and submission</v>

1130
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:41.290
<v Speaker 1>submissive thing that men and women</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1131
00:48:41.291 --> 00:48:44.920
<v Speaker 1>There's also rape fantasies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also weird snm shit.</v>

1132
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.870
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird stuff that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

1133
00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just built into the,</v>

1134
00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.190
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the operating system and your</v>

1135
00:48:51.191 --> 00:48:53.770
<v Speaker 1>operating system is probably going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than Jamie's and different</v>

1136
00:48:53.771 --> 00:48:56.050
<v Speaker 1>than mine and yet there's massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>

1137
00:48:56.051 --> 00:48:58.050
<v Speaker 1>And to try to find them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1138
00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to date a girl and she used to</v>

1139
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:03.340
<v Speaker 1>want me to just choke her all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She would grab my hand.</v>

1140
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.070
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't on her more girls because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your size would want that.</v>

1141
00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:10.350
<v Speaker 2>I whenever I see a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a girl,</v>

1142
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:13.920
<v Speaker 2>like you never see it like a tiny girl</v>
<v Speaker 2>with like just a monster of a dude.</v>

1143
00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always want to say to the women</v>

1144
00:49:16.111 --> 00:49:16.411
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You don't like you fuck it.</v>

1146
00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Like to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you like to almost get murdered every</v>

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1151
00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.810
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think we've talked about this</v>

1152
00:49:33.811 --> 00:49:37.680
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because girls never really saw porn</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want you to spank me because I want</v>

1166
00:50:03.001 --> 00:50:04.980
<v Speaker 2>you to spank me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to spank me because you</v>

1167
00:50:04.981 --> 00:50:06.740
<v Speaker 2>want to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't,</v>

1168
00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:07.621
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1169
00:50:07.621 --> 00:50:08.790
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what</v>

1170
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I did girl once who told me she wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to rape her and I said,</v>

1171
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.220
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want me to rape you,</v>

1172
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.710
<v Speaker 1>then it's not raping you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

1173
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.710
<v Speaker 1>and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was joking around,</v>

1174
00:50:22.711 --> 00:50:25.590
<v Speaker 1>she was like halfway joking around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had some weird shit.</v>

1175
00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 1>Like she wanted me to grab the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>her head</v>

1176
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:32.030
<v Speaker 3>and force it on my Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she liked that she got off on that</v>

1177
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.291
<v Speaker 3>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1178
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:38.120
<v Speaker 3>but the only way that I can do that is</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I know that you want me to do that.</v>

1179
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:41.610
<v Speaker 3>Like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I can't deal with,</v>

1180
00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:43.820
<v Speaker 3>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like,</v>

1181
00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:46.700
<v Speaker 3>that's whenever girls want rough shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1182
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:48.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

1183
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:49.550
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get there,</v>

1184
00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:53.660
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like saying you want someone to rape.</v>

1185
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.140
<v Speaker 3>The problem with the rape thing is like</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we just go through this,</v>

1186
00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.390
<v Speaker 3>are you going to fight back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you going to say no,</v>

1187
00:50:59.590 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 3>if I keep going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's still rape.</v>

1188
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like even though you said you wanted me</v>

1189
00:51:03.021 --> 00:51:05.240
<v Speaker 3>to rape dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you say no and keep going and</v>

1190
00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:09.560
<v Speaker 3>ultimately it just wound up staying the</v>
<v Speaker 3>way it was like we never went into fully</v>

1191
00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 3>into the rave fantasy because I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1192
00:51:11.330 --> 00:51:12.740
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super perturbed by it.</v>

1193
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this could go terrible.</v>

1194
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1195
00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want ever to get sexually</v>

1196
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:23.150
<v Speaker 3>aroused by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be connected.</v>

1197
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think that like I stayed at</v>

1198
00:51:25.941 --> 00:51:28.880
<v Speaker 3>girl and she used to like the rubber</v>
<v Speaker 3>feet on my deck and for a while I had</v>

1199
00:51:28.881 --> 00:51:31.070
<v Speaker 3>like this foot fetish thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1200
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1201
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:33.820
<v Speaker 3>like I had it for years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

1202
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:35.090
<v Speaker 3>she started it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.540
<v Speaker 3>Well she was into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1204
00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.870
<v Speaker 3>She'd like suck on my toes and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was a freak,</v>

1205
00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:43.880
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that thing became like a sexually</v>

1206
00:51:43.881 --> 00:51:46.220
<v Speaker 3>arousing thing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at girls' feet and I would get</v>

1207
00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.640
<v Speaker 3>excited about them for years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1208
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:53.420
<v Speaker 3>If you had a girl who wanted you to</v>
<v Speaker 3>smack her around.</v>

1209
00:51:53.530 --> 00:51:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1210
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:58.040
<v Speaker 3>and I have a friend who likes that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's into that and dates girls that</v>

1211
00:51:58.041 --> 00:51:59.570
<v Speaker 3>are into that and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1212
00:51:59.571 --> 00:52:01.970
<v Speaker 3>like probably on their pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own website,</v>

1213
00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:05.420
<v Speaker 3>their own sam pictures of like bruises</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he left on them.</v>

1214
00:52:05.421 --> 00:52:07.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ dude.</v>

1215
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:08.061
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1216
00:52:08.061 --> 00:52:09.920
<v Speaker 3>if it goes all ugly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to go real ugly for me.</v>

1217
00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's consensual.</v>

1218
00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.510
<v Speaker 3>But what proof does he have that no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1219
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.341
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1220
00:52:16.341 --> 00:52:18.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to get sexually attracted</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that and I don't want to,</v>

1221
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I don't want that to be like the foot</v>
<v Speaker 3>fetish thing where you become that like</v>

1222
00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:25.220
<v Speaker 3>that's your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm really into a smack and girls</v>

1223
00:52:25.221 --> 00:52:26.630
<v Speaker 3>around and holding him down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1224
00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:28.840
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause then you got to like,</v>

1225
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:31.810
<v Speaker 4>that's what you need.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you'd have to go to craigslist or</v>

1226
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:33.700
<v Speaker 4>you'd have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got an a toll on.</v>

1227
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:34.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You mean you have to,</v>

1228
00:52:34.721 --> 00:52:37.030
<v Speaker 4>you have to like say look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what I'm looking for.</v>

1229
00:52:37.031 --> 00:52:39.190
<v Speaker 4>Very specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is this cool with you?</v>

1230
00:52:39.191 --> 00:52:43.260
<v Speaker 4>I come to you with a heavy heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>dear Craig.</v>

1231
00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.560
<v Speaker 4>But then the problem with that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1232
00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:52.690
<v Speaker 4>how do you know that the woman wants</v>
<v Speaker 4>that every time you know there's going</v>

1233
00:52:52.691 --> 00:52:55.270
<v Speaker 4>to be tying now that's what I'm saying</v>
<v Speaker 4>about like,</v>

1234
00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.590
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm guessed wrong,</v>

1235
00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.420
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to deal with which is where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need,</v>

1236
00:52:58.450 --> 00:53:03.450
<v Speaker 4>that's where consent comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where like consent and I again,</v>

1237
00:53:03.971 --> 00:53:06.910
<v Speaker 4>because women are physically weaker in</v>
<v Speaker 4>general in men and,</v>

1238
00:53:06.970 --> 00:53:10.630
<v Speaker 4>and when sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has to be them pitching it.</v>

1239
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:11.890
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In a way.</v>

1240
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:13.300
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because otherwise,</v>

1241
00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:15.570
<v Speaker 4>especially if it's physical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1242
00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:20.020
<v Speaker 4>A buddy of mine who's huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>physically huge,</v>

1243
00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:23.950
<v Speaker 4>a girl said choke me.</v>

1262
00:54:17.851 --> 00:54:19.620
<v Speaker 4>3000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that,</v>

00:54:21.390 --> 00:54:22.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>3000 years ago it was probably an</v>

1265
00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:24.010
<v Speaker 4>option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1266
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:27.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1270
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:40.020
<v Speaker 4>It consensual sex is like that thing of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the universe is this old and earth</v>

1271

1276
00:54:55.471 --> 00:54:59.460
<v Speaker 1>going to force human beings to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reevaluate their behavior and that is</v>

1277
00:54:59.461 --> 00:54:59.730
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

1278
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.190
<v Speaker 4>moves evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cultural.</v>

<v Speaker 2>something in my drink.</v>

1328
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:12.100

1331
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:20.470
<v Speaker 2>I think you put something in my drink</v>
<v Speaker 2>and runs.</v>

1332
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 2>And I chased her for like 10 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:28.030
<v Speaker 2>I can't chase a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I can't,</v>

1334
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.520
<v Speaker 2>I can't chase this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1335
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.230
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How well did you know her?</v>

1336
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:36.340
<v Speaker 4>Not well at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met her on a Tuesday and this was a</v>

1337
00:57:36.341 --> 00:57:37.174
<v Speaker 4>Friday.</v>

1338
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:41.790
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for three hours I was like,</v>

1339
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:44.400

<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm going to jail.</v>

1340
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know,</v>

1341
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.720
<v Speaker 4>like I didn't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I couldn't prove I didn't do</v>

1342
00:57:48.721 --> 00:57:50.730
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I couldn't almost,</v>

1343
00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:54.360
<v Speaker 4>it would be a move at that point to call</v>
<v Speaker 4>the police.</v>

1344
00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1345
00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:58.410
<v Speaker 4>And say someone just accused me and</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting something in their drink.</v>

1346
00:57:58.440 --> 00:58:00.580
<v Speaker 4>I absolutely didn't.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1349
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:08.310
<v Speaker 4>Looking back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking back now,</v>

1350
00:58:08.311 --> 00:58:10.710
<v Speaker 4>I realize it was at a casino.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there's cameras everywhere.</v>

1351
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:11.690
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1352
00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:15.930
<v Speaker 4>but could the cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cameras have picked up me fucking</v>

1353
00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:17.580
<v Speaker 4>dropping.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like could they,</v>

1354
00:58:17.581 --> 00:58:19.680
<v Speaker 4>maybe they weren't high resolution</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

1355
00:58:20.130 --> 00:58:20.963
<v Speaker 4>What year?</v>

1356
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.770
<v Speaker 2>2004 they probably were.</v>

1357
00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:25.891
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're there.</v>

1358
00:58:25.891 --> 00:58:28.280
<v Speaker 4>They're there to like prevent stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1359
00:58:28.281 --> 00:58:30.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then gambling tricks.</v>

1360
00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:32.470
<v Speaker 4>So they must be able to see like your</v>
<v Speaker 4>hands,</v>

1361
00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:34.100
<v Speaker 4>they can zoom in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

1362
00:58:34.170 --> 00:58:36.390
<v Speaker 4>but how you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much whenever you see it.</v>

1363
00:58:36.391 --> 00:58:36.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1364
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:40.940
<v Speaker 2>It's all kind of like kind of pixelated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But after three hours,</v>

1365
00:58:40.941 --> 00:58:42.800
<v Speaker 2>she finally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>called me and was like,</v>

1428
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:07.150
<v Speaker 4>She was going to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1429
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the time.</v>

1430

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was gonna take her to the ultimate</v>

1433
01:01:13.911 --> 01:01:15.560
<v Speaker 4>musical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1434
01:01:15.561 --> 01:01:18.290
<v Speaker 4>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and thankfully she got sick and didn't</v>

1435
01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:19.670
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1436
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.100
<v Speaker 4>in the whole time it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1437
01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:25.130
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing that one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 4>with some of these stories is like,</v>

1438
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:30.580
<v Speaker 4>why would bill cosby want to be friends</v>
<v Speaker 4>with some lady?</v>

1439
01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.930
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what,</v>

1440
01:01:32.931 --> 01:01:35.390
<v Speaker 4>just because you're great looking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1441
01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's entirely possible that a</v>

1442
01:01:38.481 --> 01:01:40.790
<v Speaker 4>guy could be friends with a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1443
01:01:40.791 --> 01:01:42.820
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though he wants to fuck her,</v>

1444
01:01:42.850 --> 01:01:45.170
<v Speaker 4>just keep it together and just be</v>
<v Speaker 4>friends with her and,</v>

1445
01:01:45.171 --> 01:01:48.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find some interesting muse.</v>

1446
01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:53.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I do think it's not very likely in</v>

1447
01:01:53.631 --> 01:01:55.370
<v Speaker 4>my experience with humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1448
01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

1449
01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:57.920
<v Speaker 4>And also why would it got torched</v>
<v Speaker 4>himself like that?</v>

1450
01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:01.130
<v Speaker 4>It's like when a guy has a hot nanny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dummy,</v>

1451
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:04.160
<v Speaker 4>ugly nanny.</v>

1453
01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.530
<v Speaker 4>The hot nanny always winds up being a</v>
<v Speaker 4>pro.</v>

1454
01:02:08.550 --> 01:02:10.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1513
01:04:45.841 --> 01:04:46.674
<v Speaker 2>of garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1514
01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:47.700
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1515
01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.130
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my interaction with them at that time,</v>

1516
01:04:50.131 --> 01:04:51.540
<v Speaker 2>it was not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't pleasant.</v>

1517
01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:53.640
<v Speaker 2>And just seeing how he talked to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>

1518
01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:55.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a fucking not a good dude.</v>

1519
01:04:56.110 --> 01:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he definitely has an elitist sort of a</v>

1520
01:04:58.121 --> 01:05:00.580
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that elitist sort of a thing</v>

1521
01:05:00.581 --> 01:05:04.930
<v Speaker 1>is one of the ways that he was able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>separate himself from his victims that</v>

1522
01:05:04.931 --> 01:05:07.000
<v Speaker 1>he's better than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1523
01:05:07.001 --> 01:05:09.730
<v Speaker 1>he would behave in these weird ways when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do these shows.</v>

1524
01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>I've talked about it before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1525
01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:12.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1526
01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I talked to these people that worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>with him in a casino and he would make</v>

1527
01:05:16.421 --> 01:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>the entire sit down and watch him eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1528
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.520
<v Speaker 1>So all the people that worked in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>

1529
01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>all the people that work the isles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have to come in the room and</v>

1530
01:05:27.761 --> 01:05:29.650
<v Speaker 1>stand there while he ate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Then he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a security guard,</v>

1532
01:05:31.661 --> 01:05:35.830
<v Speaker 1>tuck him into bed at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he climbs into bed and the security</v>

1533
01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:39.240
<v Speaker 1>guard tucks him in and then shuts the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights out and shuts the door.</v>

1534
01:05:39.270 --> 01:05:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Something similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1535
01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>black American culture in history.</v>

1556
01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:40.610
<v Speaker 4>emmy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the first black dude to do well.</v>

1557

<v Speaker 4>A lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1558
01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:43.790
<v Speaker 4>And did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did it the right way.</v>

1559
01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had an animated show to the people</v>

1560
01:06:45.771 --> 01:06:49.040
<v Speaker 4>forgot about fat Albert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a huge hint and blind people</v>

1561
01:06:49.041 --> 01:06:49.930
<v Speaker 4>didn't forget about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1562
01:06:50.420 --> 01:06:51.670
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to find now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1563
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1564
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.180
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like just a huge impact.</v>

1565
01:06:56.181 --> 01:06:58.370
<v Speaker 4>And it was a real loss for black people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1566
01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.960
<v Speaker 4>so a guy like Chuck d who was eminently</v>
<v Speaker 4>respectable is like,</v>

1567
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:04.490
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a mourning period.</v>

1568
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:07.040
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's got to be careful when you pull</v>

1569
01:07:07.041 --> 01:07:09.110
<v Speaker 4>the trigger on calling it a smear</v>
<v Speaker 4>campaign.</v>

1570
01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:10.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally agree.</v>

1571
01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:13.100
<v Speaker 4>And it's entirely possible that your</v>
<v Speaker 4>heroes a piece of shit and yeah.</v>

1572
01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:15.580
<v Speaker 4>And people can have both qualities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they guess</v>

1573
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>amazing at something and very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also be</v>

1574
01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:19.983
<v Speaker 4>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1575
01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.770
<v Speaker 4>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know if I believe it,</v>

1576
01:07:22.771 --> 01:07:27.771
<v Speaker 4>but I had the thought that like Cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the kink came before the talent,</v>

1577
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:35.460
<v Speaker 4>meaning I know I like poisoning people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1578
01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:40.880
<v Speaker 4>How do I put myself in a position to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>able to plausibly poison women?</v>

1579
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:47.940
<v Speaker 4>Leave subconsciously.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how people work.</v>

1580
01:07:47.941 --> 01:07:52.941
<v Speaker 4>I honestly believe that there's like in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the unconscious that you go,</v>

1581
01:07:53.281 --> 01:07:57.090
<v Speaker 4>I have this thing cause that's not a</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that you just develop.</v>

1582
01:07:57.091 --> 01:07:58.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that.</v>

1583
01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:03.150
<v Speaker 4>And that's also not even a power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not even a power thing.</v>

1584
01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:05.820
<v Speaker 4>That's some other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is power.</v>

1585
01:08:05.821 --> 01:08:09.070
<v Speaker 4>But it's like sociopathy it's not just</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>

1586
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:14.090
<v Speaker 4>it's not like Harvey Weinstein is like a</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me is like the casting couch run</v>

1587
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:16.640
<v Speaker 4>amuck.</v>

1588
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:18.050
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want,</v>

1589
01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.370
<v Speaker 2>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck me.</v>

1590
01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:20.331
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

1591
01:08:20.331 --> 01:08:21.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a hot actress.</v>

1592
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:24.290
<v Speaker 2>I got power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought that's how it works.</v>

1593
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought that's kind of the way</v>

1594
01:08:26.061 --> 01:08:27.980
<v Speaker 2>the game was played,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1595
01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 2>with cosby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1596
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:32.750
<v Speaker 2>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of harvey ship was just straight</v>

1597
01:08:32.751 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 2>rap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1598
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:34.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1599
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:35.780
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that they were all</v>
<v Speaker 2>actresses,</v>

1600
01:08:35.781 --> 01:08:38.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a coincidence.</v>

1601
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but with cosby it's like</v>

1602
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>that probably existed when he was 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1603
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's entirely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1604
01:08:49.790 --> 01:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking about this as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think that there was a time when</v>

1605
01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.850
<v Speaker 1>that was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was a time where slipping</v>

1606
01:08:55.851 --> 01:08:58.730
<v Speaker 1>a mickey into someone's drink was</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that a lot of men did.</v>

1607
01:08:58.820 --> 01:08:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

1608
01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.370
<v Speaker 1>we looked at things in a different way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like we look at hitting women.</v>

1609
01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a different way.</v>

1610
01:09:05.481 --> 01:09:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Like you go watch those old movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The women got smacked all the time.</v>

1611
01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>It was normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1612
01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:13.670
<v Speaker 1>The leading man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve McQueen would smack the shit out</v>

1613
01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 1>of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1614
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.651
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dear,</v>

1615
01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't give it to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:09:16.850 --> 01:09:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Try and slap it a woman now in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try it and be the hero.</v>

1617
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's again,</v>

1618
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:25.790
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural evolution happening.</v>

1619
01:09:25.790 --> 01:09:27.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The also was that thing of like,</v>

1620
01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.490

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1628
01:09:40.970 --> 01:09:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well a woman was thought to be a bundle</v>

1629
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:49.280
<v Speaker 1>of sticks was used for a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's burdensome.</v>

1630
01:09:49.490 --> 01:09:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Like a bundle of sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1631
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's difficult to carry around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a faggot as a man became a man who's</v>

1632
01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:01.580
<v Speaker 1>like a woman who's burdensome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bundle of sticks.</v>

1633
01:10:01.581 --> 01:10:03.280
<v Speaker 1>It was never anything about what does it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

1634
01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.480
<v Speaker 1>here it goes the archaic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:08.660

<v Speaker 1>We don't have to unit of volume.</v>

1636
01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this a bundle of sticks thing was</v>

1637
01:10:12.951 --> 01:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>like how men thought of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1638
01:10:15.231 --> 01:10:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh Carrie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this bitch around Jesus Christ,</v>

1639
01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:20.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bundle of sticks is annoying to carry</v>

1640
01:10:20.061 --> 01:10:22.040
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got a question for you.</v>

1641
01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.600

<v Speaker 2>With now that we've got Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cosby.</v>

1644
01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they're even in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>category for my own,</v>

1645
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:36.100
<v Speaker 2>for just for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prior beat,</v>

<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

1648
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that there is a</v>

1649
01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:42.520
<v Speaker 2>correlation?</v>

1650
01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.050
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1651
01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Between comedic excellence and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>degenerate behavior.</v>

1652
01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sort of why I said it to the crowd</v>

1702
01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:08.860
<v Speaker 1>we did it to a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes on more ominous tones when he's</v>

1703
01:13:08.861 --> 01:13:09.700
<v Speaker 1>doing it to women.</v>

1704

<v Speaker 4>Completely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1715
01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Eliza slessinger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was saying that men would say things</v>

1716
01:13:32.511 --> 01:13:35.150
<v Speaker 1>to her when she first started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Docs wasn't very good.</v>

1717
01:13:35.151 --> 01:13:37.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just started out and these guys were</v>

1718
01:13:37.461 --> 01:13:39.980
<v Speaker 1>like established guys and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat her as if like,</v>

1719
01:13:39.981 --> 01:13:44.510
<v Speaker 1>you're below me and you're always going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be below me and I can get away with</v>

1720
01:13:44.511 --> 01:13:46.670
<v Speaker 1>saying whenever I wanted to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause you're less than me.</v>

1721
01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.250

<v Speaker 1>and I kind of feel like that's probably</v>

1722
01:13:49.251 --> 01:13:51.950
<v Speaker 1>why he did that to those girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was above them,</v>

1723

<v Speaker 4>earlier?</v>

1727
01:14:01.461 --> 01:14:06.220

<v Speaker 4>which is getting hard right from that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>about for,</v>

1744
01:14:46.210 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be,</v>

1745
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:50.080
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be a lot of dudes at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

1746
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.050
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be 90% dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've asked the crowd,</v>

1747
01:14:53.051 --> 01:14:55.210
<v Speaker 4>I've asked probably five or six</v>
<v Speaker 4>different crowds.</v>

1748
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:59.880
<v Speaker 4>If Louis was doing the show after this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>would you go and 70% of the people</v>

1749
01:14:59.910 --> 01:15:01.180
<v Speaker 4>applaud?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:15:01.570 --> 01:15:03.190
<v Speaker 4>They would want to see what the fuck he</v>
<v Speaker 4>has to say.</v>

1751
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:05.770
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he should go on stage.</v>

1752
01:15:05.771 --> 01:15:07.030
<v Speaker 4>The first words out of his mouth should</v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

1753
01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:09.390
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I asked I there's,</v>

1754
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:11.870
<v Speaker 4>I believe light should just come up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's jerking off.</v>

1755
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:18.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great idea.</v>

1756
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm just like lights down and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1757
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:23.920
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what he did was freaky and</v>

1758
01:15:23.921 --> 01:15:24.970
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think Louie,</v>

1759
01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't think louise a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really know him very well,</v>

1760
01:15:27.371 --> 01:15:29.080
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's a bad person.</v>

1761
01:15:29.081 --> 01:15:30.160
<v Speaker 1>He's always been friendly to me.</v>

1762
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:31.790
<v Speaker 4>He's not a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like</v>

1763
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:35.300
<v Speaker 4>he's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not a bad,</v>

1764
01:15:35.301 --> 01:15:37.040
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's also,</v>

1765
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:40.910
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be like defending a sex</v>

1766
01:15:40.911 --> 01:15:43.670
<v Speaker 4>criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's a power thing.</v>

1767
01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.340
<v Speaker 4>He the more powerful we got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lessee did it.</v>

1768
01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:47.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1769
01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:48.480
<v Speaker 1>That's the weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1770
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:50.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he realized that what he did was</v>

1771
01:15:50.371 --> 01:15:54.990
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and like he had these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>urges and he did it and then as time</v>

1772
01:15:54.991 --> 01:15:56.820
<v Speaker 1>went on he stopped doing it and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1773
01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:58.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm a prisoner to some shit that I know</v>

1774
01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.460
<v Speaker 4>did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if he had just got in front of it,</v>

1775
01:16:00.461 --> 01:16:04.510
<v Speaker 4>I feel like if he had just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he had just talked about it in a</v>

1776
01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:09.190
<v Speaker 4>letter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>men talked about fucking his staff on</v>

1777
01:16:09.191 --> 01:16:12.670
<v Speaker 4>the air and no one cared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1778
01:16:12.730 --> 01:16:17.730
<v Speaker 4>letterman just went straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you mean 100% confessional?</v>

1779
01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which I think Louis could,</v>

1780
01:16:19.500 --> 01:16:22.420
<v Speaker 4>I think he just mishandled it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Liked having sex with the people that</v>

1781
01:16:22.421 --> 01:16:25.060
<v Speaker 4>work with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

1782
01:16:25.061 --> 01:16:27.220
<v Speaker 4>I'm being blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I talked to the lady about this</v>

1783
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:27.520
<v Speaker 4>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1784
01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.170
<v Speaker 4>have you watched it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's getting laughs the whole time.</v>

1785
01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:31.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1786
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:33.990
<v Speaker 4>Like the whole time I'm getting big</v>
<v Speaker 4>labs.</v>

1787
01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.470
<v Speaker 4>He was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1788
01:16:35.471 --> 01:16:37.020
<v Speaker 4>I miss him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>

1789
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:40.000
<v Speaker 4>the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like the irony of like Netflix</v>

1790
01:16:40.001 --> 01:16:40.870
<v Speaker 4>didn't pull his show.</v>

1791
01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was only having sex with people,</v>

1792
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:47.690
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having sex with people back then,</v>

1793
01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:52.720
<v Speaker 1>but that you not want a piece of power</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that's can sit again.</v>

1794
01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:55.130
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1795
01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.840
<v Speaker 1>You've got to rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels like it's changed.</v>

1796
01:16:57.260 --> 01:16:59.450
<v Speaker 1>What's changed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it just everyone?</v>

1797
01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I think the Harvey Weinstein thing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fucking gross and he's such a monster</v>

1798
01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:08.870
<v Speaker 1>that everybody's like complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's this ripple effect and</v>

1799
01:17:08.871 --> 01:17:13.340
<v Speaker 1>that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like way beyond normal reactions</v>

1800
01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:15.790
<v Speaker 1>for things like Matt Lauer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1801
01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm still trying to figure out what Matt</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lauer did that got him fired.</v>

1802
01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>He had sex with someone on staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1803
01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I think he had sex with someone on staff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably felt like she couldn't</v>

1804
01:17:28.521 --> 01:17:31.670
<v Speaker 1>stop that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the,</v>

1805
01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.700
<v Speaker 1>that would be that sort of rub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1806
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:36.080
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1807
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't want a victim shame.</v>

1808
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>

1809
01:17:39.890 --> 01:17:42.530
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know his version.</v>

1810
01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know her version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just know the third hand version.</v>

1811
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:49.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I read one that he had sex with</v>

1812
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:53.630
<v Speaker 1>some girl until she blacked out and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt Lauer likes to fuck.</v>

1813
01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's throwing in his office girl sir.</v>

1814
01:17:56.570 --> 01:17:59.390
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing was that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a button at his desk or you can lock the</v>

1815
01:17:59.391 --> 01:18:00.620
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1816
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to me is less,</v>

1817
01:18:02.901 --> 01:18:03.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1818
01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:06.410
<v Speaker 1>rape trap then than it is just like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

1819
01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:11.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to get up and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're the opposite that big and</v>

1820
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:13.770
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

1821
01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:17.720
<v Speaker 1>it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to walk 40 feet right.</v>

1822
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:19.610
<v Speaker 1>Every time I need to shut the door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1823
01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:22.040
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's writing right when you,</v>

1824
01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:23.660
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be disturbed.</v>

1825
01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.700
<v Speaker 1>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's rather just let me just lock the</v>

1826
01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:27.440
<v Speaker 1>fucking door and lock it into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1827
01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think it was writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just like a convenience</v>

1828
01:18:30.561 --> 01:18:31.730
<v Speaker 1>thing maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a perp walk basically.</v>

1876
01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:39.860
<v Speaker 4>It's not if the two people really in</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] water</v>

1877
01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:43.450
<v Speaker 1>comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1878
01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:45.880
<v Speaker 1>dated one when I was 21</v>

1879
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I don't even really like sleeping with</v>
<v Speaker 4>wage on it.</v>

1880
01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really tried to avoid it.</v>

1881
01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:52.460
<v Speaker 4>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try everything,</v>

1882
01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.830
<v Speaker 4>everything in my power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't say I've never done it,</v>

1883
01:20:54.831 --> 01:20:57.700
<v Speaker 4>but I really try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1884
01:20:58.310 --> 01:21:02.240
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't even think a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>times you're attracted to them.</v>

1885
01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:07.040
<v Speaker 4>I think you're attracted to the dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're attracted to like the</v>

1886
01:21:07.041 --> 01:21:10.220
<v Speaker 4>uniform and like you're working and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're working.</v>

1887
01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:13.520
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to and did a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you see him off campus in</v>

1888
01:21:13.521 --> 01:21:18.010
<v Speaker 4>normal clothes and you're like</v>
<v Speaker 4>normal.</v>

1889
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:19.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1890
01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:22.040
<v Speaker 4>You go put your outfit on your apron on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen.</v>

1891
01:21:22.041 --> 01:21:25.280
<v Speaker 4>How about you pretend to work at a diner</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll stop in for a coffee and then</v>

1892
01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:26.220
<v Speaker 4>we'll talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>somebody but just,</v>

1894
01:21:29.690 --> 01:21:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I just think there's too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a comic going on.</v>

1895
01:21:34.341 --> 01:21:35.990
<v Speaker 1>We were both 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're both,</v>

1896
01:21:35.991 --> 01:21:39.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both like really raw,</v>

1897
01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:41.210
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My daughter's trying it out.</v>

1898
01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Didn't know what the fuck the future</v>
<v Speaker 1>held in store for us.</v>

1899
01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:45.050
<v Speaker 1>It was just too much comedy talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1900
01:21:45.051 --> 01:21:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's too much like me.</v>

1901
01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.560
<v Speaker 1>But she was fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1902
01:21:48.561 --> 01:21:50.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was one of the few people that it</v>

1903
01:21:50.331 --> 01:21:51.051
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1904
01:21:51.051 --> 01:21:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Like she really could be like legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when,</v>

1905
01:21:54.501 --> 01:21:57.720
<v Speaker 1>when we were all open micros together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it never worked out for her.</v>

1906
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:59.210
<v Speaker 1>She's quit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1907
01:21:59.211 --> 01:21:59.901
<v Speaker 1>Gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1908
01:21:59.901 --> 01:22:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I lost touch with her about it last time</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to her.</v>

1909
01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:04.640
<v Speaker 1>I think we were both like 22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23,</v>

1910
01:22:04.641 --> 01:22:08.630
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd heard somebody ran into her</v>

1911
01:22:08.631 --> 01:22:10.310
<v Speaker 1>at an open mic night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a year later,</v>

1912
01:22:10.311 --> 01:22:12.410
<v Speaker 1>but she had never gotten out of the open</v>
<v Speaker 1>mic scene,</v>

1913
01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she was in the open mic scene for</v>

1914
01:22:14.391 --> 01:22:16.520
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three years and never figured out how to</v>

1915
01:22:16.521 --> 01:22:18.230
<v Speaker 1>make money and now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>some people have the,</v>

1917
01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:25.780
<v Speaker 1>the fucking driving ambition to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure it out.</v>

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.560
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really like you've done it.</v>

1973
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:46.840
<v Speaker 2>You not only like you built an empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

1974
01:24:46.841 --> 01:24:49.120
<v Speaker 2>but you've like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>

1975
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:50.320
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1976
01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:56.820
<v Speaker 2>you started with your voice and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>interests and worked out inside out.</v>

1977
01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:01.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1978
01:25:01.541 --> 01:25:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like talking to people.</v>

1979
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:08.910
<v Speaker 2>I like talking to people about these</v>
<v Speaker 2>five or eight things and then you didn't</v>

1980
01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:14.880
<v Speaker 2>and you don't chase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't shondra chase too wealthy and</v>

1981
01:25:16.631 --> 01:25:18.250
<v Speaker 2>old to do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not like,</v>

1982
01:25:18.490 --> 01:25:20.170
<v Speaker 2>I got to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to know a multicam.</v>

1983
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:23.070
<v Speaker 2>You've done a holding camp but I got to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do with this thing or I got to do with</v>

1984
01:25:23.071 --> 01:25:24.580
<v Speaker 2>that or I got to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1985
01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:27.370
<v Speaker 2>if I was on a network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get billboards and I get all,</v>

1986
01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:28.870
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd get,</v>

1987
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:30.610
<v Speaker 2>you don't do dumb shit.</v>

1988
01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:31.980
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1989
01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:33.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm into what I'm into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1990
01:25:33.511 --> 01:25:37.530
<v Speaker 3>and I did dumb shit with fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized from doing fear factor was a</v>

1991
01:25:37.531 --> 01:25:39.360
<v Speaker 3>great education for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1992
01:25:39.361 --> 01:25:42.720
<v Speaker 3>it gave me a lot of fuck you money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was great because then I realized,</v>

1993
01:25:42.721 --> 01:25:44.910
<v Speaker 3>well once you have that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you really can't,</v>

1994
01:25:44.911 --> 01:25:46.950
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can really kind of do what you want</v>

1995
01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:49.620
<v Speaker 3>if you don't have to worry about how</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bills are being paid.</v>

1996
01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.730
<v Speaker 3>Now you have this freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if they cancel it tomorrow and</v>

1997
01:25:53.731 --> 01:25:54.720
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have this.</v>

1998
01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.240
<v Speaker 3>I didn't spend it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have a bunch of money and now I</v>

1999
01:25:57.241 --> 01:25:59.280
<v Speaker 3>can make a living doing standup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could do whatever I want.</v>

2000
01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:00.380
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

2001
01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:03.830
<v Speaker 2>could not make a living doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to make a living.</v>

2002
01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2003
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:06.950
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to write you a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't need to make a living.</v>

2004
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:07.823
<v Speaker 4>You've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2005
01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just lay back.</v>

2006
01:26:09.010 --> 01:26:09.801
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to.</v>

2007
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:12.890
<v Speaker 4>But I can never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm just,</v>

2008
01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:16.460
<v Speaker 4>I just decided somewhere along the line</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2009
01:26:16.461 --> 01:26:18.280
<v Speaker 4>what am I really interested in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2010
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.280
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that to me is the key of like,</v>

2011
01:26:21.290 --> 01:26:24.290
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of where I've gotten in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>last,</v>

2012
01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.570
<v Speaker 4>literally in the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause like the,</v>

2013
01:26:26.571 --> 01:26:29.450
<v Speaker 4>my three Mike's was popular and</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>

2014
01:26:29.451 --> 01:26:32.840
<v Speaker 4>like creatively and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

2015
01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:35.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people liked it and critics liked it.</v>

2016
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:40.690
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was the last year is the first</v>

2017
01:26:41.601 --> 01:26:44.870
<v Speaker 4>time I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I funny?</v>

2018
01:26:45.230 --> 01:26:46.280
<v Speaker 4>Am I talent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2019
01:26:46.281 --> 01:26:47.114
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

2020
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:52.510
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I can stop doing shit out of who</v>

2021
01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:58.780
<v Speaker 4>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This dumb thing that is mostly paranoia,</v>

2022
01:26:59.210 --> 01:27:00.860
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because when you find,</v>

2023
01:27:00.861 --> 01:27:02.230
<v Speaker 4>when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what you'd even,</v>

2024
01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:02.780
<v Speaker 4>what do you mean?</v>

2025
01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:05.110
<v Speaker 4>Am I funny?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or can you write to her kin?</v>

2026
01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:08.360
<v Speaker 4>Like the things that I would actually</v>
<v Speaker 4>consciously think.</v>

2027
01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard when you battle those things</v>

2028
01:27:11.571 --> 01:27:13.760
<v Speaker 4>in your head because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they steal,</v>

2029
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:16.880
<v Speaker 4>they steal your perception.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2030
01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:18.960
<v Speaker 4>they had such a waste of time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>such a way.</v>

2031
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:21.350
<v Speaker 4>It's not even a waste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2032
01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:24.680
<v Speaker 4>it's maybe the biggest waste of anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>on our,</v>

2033
01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.510
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>

2034
01:27:26.511 --> 01:27:29.780
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's your brain is,</v>

2035
01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:33.110
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an occupying force in your brain,</v>

2036
01:27:33.140 --> 01:27:36.320
<v Speaker 4>but it's impossible to tell that to</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who's just starting out or who's</v>

2037
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:39.590
<v Speaker 4>ambitious and struggling because like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is all they want.</v>

2038
01:27:39.620 --> 01:27:40.250
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2039
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:44.210
<v Speaker 4>they so desire affirmation to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2040
01:27:44.211 --> 01:27:45.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm a legit pro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2041
01:27:45.831 --> 01:27:47.810
<v Speaker 4>And that's the thing is I got enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>affirmation.</v>

2042
01:27:47.811 --> 01:27:50.900
<v Speaker 4>It was three Mikes as popular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2043
01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:53.510
<v Speaker 4>and I use,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is how dumb the inner voices were,</v>

2044
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:55.100
<v Speaker 4>I would think.</v>

2045
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:57.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can write sketches,</v>

2046
01:27:57.530 --> 01:28:00.260
<v Speaker 4>but you can only write single camera</v>
<v Speaker 4>sketches.</v>

2047
01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.393
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so cool.</v>

2048
01:28:01.550 --> 01:28:04.670
<v Speaker 4>So then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you probably can't write multicam</v>

2049
01:28:04.671 --> 01:28:06.590
<v Speaker 4>sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then Dave hosted snl.</v>

2050
01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.450
<v Speaker 4>He asked me to help him with it and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>wrote a great sketch and I was like,</v>

2051
01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.370
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course he can.</v>

2052
01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:14.320
<v Speaker 4>You could write with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2053
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:14.960
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

2054
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.750
<v Speaker 4>it might mean next town was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

2055
01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:21.320
<v Speaker 4>I know you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was so obvious to everyone except me.</v>

2056
01:28:21.321 --> 01:28:23.660
<v Speaker 4>And then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the popularity of three Mikes,</v>

2057
01:28:23.661 --> 01:28:25.010
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2058
01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:27.650
<v Speaker 4>it's fulfilling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is fulfilling.</v>

2059
01:28:27.651 --> 01:28:31.040
<v Speaker 4>But it's also like you just check it off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the list of like,</v>

2060
01:28:31.070 --> 01:28:31.903
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2061
01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't have to pursue this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2062
01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:39.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that that won't bring me.</v>

2063
01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.130
<v Speaker 4>It did bring me fulfillment in that it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut the voices up,</v>

2064
01:28:43.670 --> 01:28:45.470
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't bring me fulfillment of</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2065
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:51.010
<v Speaker 4>now when I walk into restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five people know me and that's changed.</v>

2066
01:28:51.110 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 4>Like that doesn't sound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people love that.</v>

2067
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:56.990
<v Speaker 4>Some people live for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I find that to be nothing.</v>

2068
01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.400
<v Speaker 4>That's a giant distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2069
01:28:58.401 --> 01:29:00.260
<v Speaker 4>I just find it to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2070
01:29:00.261 --> 01:29:02.110
<v Speaker 4>you know what time it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I'm just like,</v>

2071
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't really remember it like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's gratifying,</v>

2072
01:29:04.531 --> 01:29:06.150
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2073
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:07.980
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>

2074
01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>permeate,</v>

2075
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:11.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it gets to a place where you're like</v>

2076
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:16.110
<v Speaker 4>Chris rock where it becomes a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if Chris rock goes into spargo or</v>

2077
01:29:16.111 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 4>wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all a sudden,</v>

2078
01:29:17.611 --> 01:29:18.390
<v Speaker 4>whoosh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2079
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:21.030
<v Speaker 4>Like all eyes are on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The paparazzi get notified,</v>

2080
01:29:21.031 --> 01:29:24.060
<v Speaker 4>the waiting out in front with cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people inside or look and he's over</v>

2081
01:29:24.061 --> 01:29:24.751
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's over there.</v>

2082
01:29:24.751 --> 01:29:25.800
<v Speaker 4>He's over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's over there.</v>

2083
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.710
<v Speaker 4>There's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's that level where you get,</v>

2084
01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:32.010
<v Speaker 4>where it becomes a giant distraction and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it fucks with your art too.</v>

2085
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:33.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's just as good about that</v>

2086

2095
01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm smart of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking smart guy though.</v>

2096
01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he can see the pitfalls in advance.</v>

2097
01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:00.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2098
01:30:00.841 --> 01:30:04.560
<v Speaker 4>which is why he's a great comic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like psychologically aware.</v>

2099
01:30:04.561 --> 01:30:08.100
<v Speaker 4>He's not just delusional and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>push something that he's,</v>

2100
01:30:08.101 --> 01:30:10.170
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's trying to like make work.</v>

2102
01:30:11.131 --> 01:30:15.180
<v Speaker 4>he ha we all have blind spots creatively</v>
<v Speaker 4>and personally.</v>

2103
01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:20.040
<v Speaker 4>He has maybe the fewest blind spots of</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyone I know.</v>

2104
01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:24.120
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why he was willing to hire</v>
<v Speaker 4>people to help him with his act.</v>

2105
01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:28.200
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing of hiring people,</v>

2106
01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.540
<v Speaker 4>because I worked on his new hour.</v>

2107
01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:34.110
<v Speaker 4>Here's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He likes comedy writers.</v>

2108
01:30:34.140 --> 01:30:36.210
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're him,</v>

2110
01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:42.420
<v Speaker 4>No one's walking up to rock and giving</v>
<v Speaker 4>them tags.</v>

2111
01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:45.000
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course would cause I know him,</v>

2112
01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:48.090
<v Speaker 4>but like most like he doesn't really</v>
<v Speaker 4>have like peers,</v>

2113
01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:48.661
<v Speaker 4>peers.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

2118
01:30:59.221 --> 01:31:01.780
<v Speaker 4>it just makes me feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does I to,</v>

2119
01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:06.420
<v Speaker 4>he just likes comics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you in his new hour like it's</v>

2120
01:31:06.421 --> 01:31:09.540
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a two tags,</v>

2121
01:31:10.740 --> 01:31:12.990
<v Speaker 4>another so premises.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's none of that shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>There's like literally I've two tags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't,</v>

2123

<v Speaker 4>told them you wouldn't notice.</v>

2124
01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:22.380
<v Speaker 4>But it's also in the interest of making</v>
<v Speaker 4>the overall product better and so he's</v>

2125
01:31:22.381 --> 01:31:25.080
<v Speaker 4>willing to have a bunch of outside eyes</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking.</v>

2126
01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.810
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's putting your material against his</v>

2127
01:31:27.811 --> 01:31:28.561
<v Speaker 4>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2130
01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:33.840
<v Speaker 4>I think I have all the best beans</v>
<v Speaker 4>already.</v>

2131
01:31:34.050 --> 01:31:35.910
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what I was going to say is his work with</v>

2132
01:31:35.911 --> 01:31:38.850
<v Speaker 4>Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jenny was a agreed yeah,</v>

2133
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:39.890
<v Speaker 4>I did too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2134
01:31:39.900 --> 01:31:42.720
<v Speaker 4>I think Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jenny's the most unheralded I thought</v>

2135
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:43.300
<v Speaker 4>one of them,</v>

2136
01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:44.950
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2137
01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:49.540
<v Speaker 4>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>His second pile of me steaming pile of</v>

2138
01:31:49.541 --> 01:31:53.880
<v Speaker 4>May was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the one he had some I remember</v>

2139
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:56.770
<v Speaker 4>out of the subway car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2140
01:31:57.040 --> 01:32:00.340
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember watching like this is fucking</v>

2141
01:32:00.370 --> 01:32:01.810
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

2142
01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't watched it in 20 years</v>

2143
01:32:03.311 --> 01:32:04.540
<v Speaker 3>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I remember going like,</v>

2144
01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:06.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this shit is really,</v>

2145
01:32:06.221 --> 01:32:08.380
<v Speaker 3>really good on a steamy pile of me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>

2146
01:32:08.381 --> 01:32:09.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to some comics about it the</v>

2147
01:32:09.881 --> 01:32:10.970
<v Speaker 3>other night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm my,</v>

2148
01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:15.310
<v Speaker 3>he has a bit about the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between the left and the right in the</v>

2149
01:32:15.311 --> 01:32:17.000
<v Speaker 3>center and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2150
01:32:17.001 --> 01:32:18.070
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to do,</v>

2151
01:32:18.071 --> 01:32:21.930
<v Speaker 3>I want to paraphrase it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fucking such a well-written</v>

2152
01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.330
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was so good at squeezing every</v>

2153
01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:28.570
<v Speaker 3>last angle at a bits fucking premise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2154
01:32:28.571 --> 01:32:31.140
<v Speaker 3>just smashed them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would just be doing,</v>

2155
01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:35.650
<v Speaker 3>it would be obliterated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And his economy of words was so magical.</v>

2156
01:32:35.651 --> 01:32:37.450
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a craftsman,</v>

2157
01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:40.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he was really fucking good.</v>

2158
01:32:40.151 --> 01:32:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a deeply troubled guy who never felt</v>

2159
01:32:42.371 --> 01:32:45.170
<v Speaker 3>like he got the respect that he deserved</v>
<v Speaker 3>and never got debbie.</v>

2160
01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in a,</v>

2161
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:51.190
<v Speaker 3>I think if he was alive today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would be this huge Netflix star</v>

2162
01:32:51.340 --> 01:32:54.460
<v Speaker 3>selling out big places and he would</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably be happy with that.</v>

2163
01:32:54.461 --> 01:32:57.330
<v Speaker 3>But in his era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't the goal and his era,</v>

2164
01:32:57.350 --> 01:33:01.690
<v Speaker 3>the goal was get a sitcom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so he used to do clubs where I would</v>

2165
01:33:01.691 --> 01:33:04.180
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do the clubs after him and they</v>

2166
01:33:04.181 --> 01:33:05.230
<v Speaker 3>would be saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2167
01:33:05.231 --> 01:33:06.970
<v Speaker 3>he hates it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to do this.</v>

2168
01:33:06.971 --> 01:33:09.790
<v Speaker 3>He hates doing press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's bummed out that he's on the road.</v>

2169
01:33:09.791 --> 01:33:11.950
<v Speaker 3>He didn't move to Hollywood to be on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>road,</v>

2170
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:14.260
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does he understand that he's like one of</v>

2171
01:33:14.261 --> 01:33:16.300
<v Speaker 3>the best comics it's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2172
01:33:16.570 --> 01:33:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Like when we were all kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we were starting out back when I</v>

2173
01:33:19.871 --> 01:33:23.560
<v Speaker 3>met you at Boston comedy and like 1991</v>
<v Speaker 3>or whatever it was,</v>

2174
01:33:23.561 --> 01:33:25.060
<v Speaker 3>you weren't even doing standing back</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

2175
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:29.380
<v Speaker 3>The goal was to make a living like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think you can make a living?</v>

2176
01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:33.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what Jenny's only problem was?</v>

2177
01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:38.230
<v Speaker 2>His material was great and I'm trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of a guy who is like this now.</v>

2178
01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:44.100
<v Speaker 2>His material was great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His presentation was artless,</v>

2179
01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:50.220
<v Speaker 2>meaning he looked like he bought us</v>
<v Speaker 2>suits at fucking at the Dick Tracy</v>

2180
01:33:51.611 --> 01:33:54.640
<v Speaker 2>villain shop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he just looked like he just had a</v>

2181
01:33:54.641 --> 01:33:59.641
<v Speaker 2>hacky sensibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His fucking bits were great.</v>

2182
01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people that don't like</v>

2183
01:34:02.501 --> 01:34:07.501
<v Speaker 2>Sebastian because of what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause he's too stylized.</v>

2184
01:34:08.020 --> 01:34:09.490
<v Speaker 2>He's not stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2185
01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:13.660
<v Speaker 2>he looked sebastian shops at the mall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2186
01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Like to what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just as my list.</v>

2187
01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.530
<v Speaker 2>He's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not an artist.</v>

2188
01:34:17.531 --> 01:34:18.850
<v Speaker 2>He's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2189
01:34:18.851 --> 01:34:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2190
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:22.640
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I once described,</v>

2191
01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.560
<v Speaker 2>I once brought Sebastian up as a blue</v>
<v Speaker 2>collar snob</v>

2192
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:32.590
<v Speaker 2>and which is exactly what he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2193
01:34:32.830 --> 01:34:35.950
<v Speaker 2>and but like there are people like olive</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments with people where I'm like,</v>

2194
01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Sebastien,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking great.</v>

2195
01:34:37.571 --> 01:34:38.920
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't need a little hacky.</v>

2196
01:34:38.930 --> 01:34:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2197
01:34:40.090 --> 01:34:42.010
<v Speaker 2>he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not hockey at all.</v>

2198
01:34:42.011 --> 01:34:47.011
<v Speaker 2>But because he dresses like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italian of fucking choose from Chicago</v>

2199
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:52.990
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd where's vast people literally</v>

2200
01:34:52.991 --> 01:34:55.750
<v Speaker 2>people deduct points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but I'm saying in terms of his peers at</v>

2209
01:35:18.121 --> 01:35:20.340
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean if you listen to Hicks,</v>

2210

<v Speaker 3>you're not going to laugh a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to a steaming pile of me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>before I filmed my last comedy special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was prepping for the comedy special</v>

2216
01:35:37.110 --> 01:35:40.710
<v Speaker 3>as I was driving home I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me listen to some Richard Jeni and I</v>

2222
01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.850
<v Speaker 3>And I think Hicks is a great comic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me wrong.</v>

2223
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:59.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's one of the most influential</v>
<v Speaker 3>and important guys ever.</v>

2224
01:35:59.701 --> 01:36:01.470
<v Speaker 3>But in terms of like humor,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He'd practice,</v>

2262
01:37:26.151 --> 01:37:27.960
<v Speaker 2>said it to someone at Hbo like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He wasn't lying.</v>

2264
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:33.590
<v Speaker 2>I demand hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Chris Rock.</v>

2265
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:35.203
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:45.310
<v Speaker 2>she reads too hard on camera with her</v>
<v Speaker 2>hair pulled back.</v>

2269
01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:48.920
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and her delivery is so like,</v>

2270
01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.213
<v Speaker 5>Gotcha.</v>

2271
01:37:51.210 --> 01:37:53.400
<v Speaker 2>The menacing is the wrong word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

2272
01:37:53.401 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like very forceful.</v>

2273
01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Kibbeh see that's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2274
01:37:58.740 --> 01:38:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I liked the fact that she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pulling my fucking hair up.</v>

2275
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:03.510
<v Speaker 3>No nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2276
01:38:03.930 --> 01:38:04.763
<v Speaker 3>no bullshit.</v>

2277
01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.410
<v Speaker 4>It was seeing it more from a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2278
01:38:07.770 --> 01:38:09.990
<v Speaker 4>just a point of view of like a stent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A director.</v>

2279
01:38:09.991 --> 01:38:10.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2280
01:38:10.301 --> 01:38:11.070
<v Speaker 4>Just like,</v>

2281
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:12.600
<v Speaker 3>cause dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it matters.</v>

2282
01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:15.720
<v Speaker 3>It does matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It matters more than you think,</v>

2283
01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:18.120
<v Speaker 3>but it matters more I think for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>person delivering it.</v>

2284
01:38:18.121 --> 01:38:21.120
<v Speaker 3>They feel comfortable and I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>because she's a beautiful woman,</v>

2285
01:38:21.330 --> 01:38:23.820
<v Speaker 3>I think for her pulling their hair out</v>
<v Speaker 3>because like,</v>

2286
01:38:23.821 --> 01:38:27.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm not accentuating that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want you to listen to what I have</v>

2287
01:38:27.361 --> 01:38:28.110
<v Speaker 3>to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2288
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:30.000

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2289
01:38:30.001 --> 01:38:32.040
<v Speaker 3>like there's parallels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like,</v>

2290
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:37.070
<v Speaker 3>like if you saw a really funny woman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was dressing like a prime time,</v>

2291
01:38:38.401 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Megan Kelly on Fox with little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 3>skirts on or boob showing,</v>

<v Speaker 3>old though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You lose,</v>

01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:29.510
<v Speaker 3>you'll lose your exuberance and your</v>
<v Speaker 3>enthusiasm and then the people are,</v>

2334
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:32.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a part of the aging process.</v>

2335
01:40:32.230 --> 01:40:35.240
<v Speaker 3>And it depends on how much you cultivate</v>
<v Speaker 3>your own personal energy.</v>

2336
01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:36.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2393
01:42:45.060 --> 01:42:46.050
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like you,</v>

2394
01:42:46.051 --> 01:42:51.051
<v Speaker 3>you like sometimes being drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like as long as the momentum's in the</v>

2395
01:42:51.161 --> 01:42:52.480
<v Speaker 3>right way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2396
01:42:52.481 --> 01:42:55.830
<v Speaker 3>like you're thinking in a good way and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything comes out in your other set</v>

2397
01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.140
<v Speaker 3>of Jack got some fucking shit to talk</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

2398
01:42:58.540 --> 01:42:59.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

2399
01:42:59.211 --> 01:43:00.044
<v Speaker 3>we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2400
01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.610
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes into his act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2401
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:03.670
<v Speaker 3>You don't really do drink much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little bit.</v>

2402
01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2403
01:43:05.711 --> 01:43:06.880
<v Speaker 3>not before go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

2404
01:43:06.881 --> 01:43:08.770
<v Speaker 3>very rarely I have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>

2405
01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like a drink.</v>

2406
01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:12.190
<v Speaker 3>Maybe two drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2407
01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.720
<v Speaker 3>it would get a little tipsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2408
01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:17.500
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being drunk on stage,</v>

2409
01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:20.470
<v Speaker 3>it's like not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not the right way to manage the</v>

2410
01:43:20.471 --> 01:43:24.040
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is a good way to not give a fuck.</v>

2411
01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:27.420
<v Speaker 3>So like if you have an idea and you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>so strongly about it and you,</v>

2412
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:31.210
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously so varies depending</v>

2413
01:43:31.211 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 3>upon where you are in your life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you are with the material.</v>

2414
01:43:34.391 --> 01:43:38.200
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes some material just needs a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of,</v>

2415
01:43:38.201 --> 01:43:39.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2416
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:41.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then if you have a couple of drinks</v>

2417
01:43:41.681 --> 01:43:43.540
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talk about that subject and you're</v>

2418
01:43:43.541 --> 01:43:43.781
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2419
01:43:43.781 --> 01:43:46.690
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck do I have to pay attention</v>
<v Speaker 3>at us?</v>

2420
01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:50.890
<v Speaker 3>And then you'd gets in a new place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's truly like jogs the,</v>

2421
01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:52.110
<v Speaker 3>where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's</v>

2422
01:43:52.110 --> 01:43:55.700
<v Speaker 1>the fucking wall they hit this wall is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>door and you're like,</v>

2423
01:43:55.701 --> 01:43:56.640
<v Speaker 1>oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2424
01:43:57.470 --> 01:44:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Talking some real shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why I'm a big believer in using as many</v>

2425
01:44:01.221 --> 01:44:04.130
<v Speaker 1>different methods as possible to explore</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

2426
01:44:04.131 --> 01:44:08.780
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the sensory deprivation</v>
<v Speaker 1>tank or pod or psychedelics or booze or,</v>

2427
01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:13.520
<v Speaker 1>or just going places and doing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think as I've gotten older and I</v>

2428
01:44:13.610 --> 01:44:17.540
<v Speaker 1>am on a schedule to put out a special</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year and a half or so,</v>

2429
01:44:18.350 --> 01:44:20.260
<v Speaker 1>two years now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like,</v>

2430
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:23.510
<v Speaker 1>my last one was in October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my last one was a year and a couple</v>

2431
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:27.050
<v Speaker 1>of months and I'm getting ready to film</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in April.</v>

2432
01:44:27.051 --> 01:44:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So it'll be about a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

2433
01:44:28.951 --> 01:44:30.970
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like a good schedule came out in</v>

2434
01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:33.350
<v Speaker 1>October or you shut it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came out in October,</v>

2435
01:44:33.351 --> 01:44:37.460
<v Speaker 1>shot it in June.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So from shoot to shoot it's about two</v>

2436
01:44:37.461 --> 01:44:38.270
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2437
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:41.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like that is,</v>

2438
01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:45.440
<v Speaker 1>if to do that I have to do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have to have experiences.</v>

2439
01:44:45.441 --> 01:44:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to force,</v>

2440
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:51.470
<v Speaker 1>I have to not force myself to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to be consciously aware of</v>

2441
01:44:51.471 --> 01:44:52.850
<v Speaker 1>being an action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2442
01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Things have to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2443
01:44:54.101 --> 01:44:59.101
<v Speaker 1>And like I'm going to Vancouver next</v>
<v Speaker 1>week to do the Boga.</v>

2444
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2445
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:06.670
<v Speaker 1>and then the weekend for that I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Bangkok is ibogaine illegal in</v>

2446
01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is beautiful.</v>

2447
01:45:09.161 --> 01:45:10.500
<v Speaker 1>It should be everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2448
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that kills people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's supposed to be amazing for</v>

2449
01:45:14.211 --> 01:45:15.620
<v Speaker 1>curing addictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:45:15.670 --> 01:45:17.540
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to see what it does for</v>

2451
01:45:17.541 --> 01:45:19.250
<v Speaker 1>depression because it's gotten way</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

2452
01:45:19.251 --> 01:45:21.140
<v Speaker 1>like in the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2453
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:22.580
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depression has gotten better.</v>

2454
01:45:22.581 --> 01:45:27.260
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again is the weird thing from,</v>

2455
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say that having a successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>special cured my depression,</v>

2456
01:45:33.470 --> 01:45:35.540
<v Speaker 1>but you hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be that linear,</v>

2457
01:45:35.541 --> 01:45:39.620
<v Speaker 1>but it made me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just got me out of fucking negative</v>

2458
01:45:39.621 --> 01:45:40.100
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

2459
01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

2460
01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:44.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you saying that because I think</v>

2461
01:45:45.230 --> 01:45:47.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a real stigma between</v>
<v Speaker 1>correlating,</v>

2462
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:51.380
<v Speaker 1>having a success and achievement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being happy.</v>

2463
01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Ari Shaffir is a great example of</v>

2464
01:45:53.561 --> 01:45:56.600
<v Speaker 1>that I think are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a chemical issue too.</v>

2465
01:45:56.630 --> 01:46:00.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ari was on Propecia for awhile and I'm</v>

2466
01:46:00.950 --> 01:46:02.330
<v Speaker 1>holding on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2467
01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Well he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2468
01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:04.580
<v Speaker 1>he let go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got off of it.</v>

2469
01:46:04.910 --> 01:46:08.630
<v Speaker 1>But one of the side effects of Propecia</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty severe depression.</v>

2470
01:46:08.631 --> 01:46:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2471
01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:11.660
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got on some psych meds,</v>

2472
01:46:11.661 --> 01:46:16.430
<v Speaker 1>he got on some antidepressants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then his career took off and he weaned</v>

2473
01:46:16.431 --> 01:46:20.540
<v Speaker 1>himself off the antidepressants and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need them anymore.</v>

2474
01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours one of the happiest guys I know.</v>

2475
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's also very successful.</v>

2476
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:26.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2477
01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:29.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2479
01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.850

2542
01:49:00.881 --> 01:49:04.090
<v Speaker 3>way to do good stuff is to worry whether</v>
<v Speaker 3>or not you're doing good stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 2>good stuff and not,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and having a good life.</v>

01:49:16.570 --> 01:49:18.060
<v Speaker 2>You have to have balls because that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2548
01:49:18.061 --> 01:49:19.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other thing that happened was like</v>

2549
01:49:19.901 --> 01:49:22.570
<v Speaker 2>when like when Charlie Murphy died this</v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

2550
01:49:22.571 --> 01:49:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I was like [inaudible] fucking that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that was it.</v>

2551
01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

2552
01:49:28.850 --> 01:49:32.470
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the end of him.</v>

2553
01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:38.110
<v Speaker 2>And like I want all I could think of was</v>
<v Speaker 2>did he have fun?</v>

2554
01:49:38.340 --> 01:49:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

2555
01:49:39.610 --> 01:49:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Like did he have fun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's really the only thing that</v>

2556
01:49:42.161 --> 01:49:43.270
<v Speaker 2>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff of like,</v>

2557
01:49:44.440 --> 01:49:47.630
<v Speaker 2>even the best known comic isn't,</v>

2558
01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't think about Carlin that</v>

2559
01:49:51.191 --> 01:49:52.660
<v Speaker 4>much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2560
01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 4>Like he matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't</v>

2561
01:49:55.710 --> 01:49:58.320
<v Speaker 3>in matters to the people that you affect</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a positive way,</v>

2562
01:49:58.321 --> 01:50:02.500
<v Speaker 3>but ultimately for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live and then you die and are,</v>

2563
01:50:02.690 --> 01:50:05.520
<v Speaker 3>are you enjoying being alive and those</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable things,</v>

2564
01:50:05.521 --> 01:50:08.250
<v Speaker 3>do they help you like the uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 3>things about Ellen,</v>

2565
01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.260
<v Speaker 3>like view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what that's going to do is going to</v>

2566
01:50:10.261 --> 01:50:14.790
<v Speaker 3>allow her through that weird sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and insecurity.</v>

2567
01:50:14.970 --> 01:50:16.730
<v Speaker 3>It's going to allow her to make an</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing special.</v>

2568
01:50:16.731 --> 01:50:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the same thing can be said of us.</v>

2569
01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:19.440
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm one,</v>

2570
01:50:19.441 --> 01:50:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to film in April.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking terrified of writing a new</v>

2571
01:50:22.741 --> 01:50:27.120
<v Speaker 3>act cause this act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first started it a year ago,</v>

2572
01:50:27.150 --> 01:50:31.860
<v Speaker 3>it was like on Bambi legs and it was dog</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and I would do it at the store and</v>

2573
01:50:31.861 --> 01:50:35.760
<v Speaker 3>I would have bits that would just be</v>
<v Speaker 3>clunky and they'd come out awkward and</v>

2574
01:50:35.761 --> 01:50:38.430
<v Speaker 3>then they started to take life after a</v>
<v Speaker 3>month or so and then they started to</v>

2575
01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:41.190
<v Speaker 3>grow and bill till it was something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could take on the road.</v>

2576
01:50:41.340 --> 01:50:43.140
<v Speaker 3>And now that I've gone through that</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole process,</v>

2577
01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:45.660
<v Speaker 3>the idea of tossing them aside and</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting all over again,</v>

2578
01:50:45.661 --> 01:50:46.630
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

2579
01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:49.620
<v Speaker 3>this is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the only way you get better.</v>

2580
01:50:49.650 --> 01:50:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2581
01:50:50.130 --> 01:50:53.880

<v Speaker 4>Ellen did like a half hour at Largo and</v>

<v Speaker 4>said followed by that being the funniest</v>

2586

<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>to attack you.</v>

2618
01:52:28.950 --> 01:52:31.590
<v Speaker 4>You have to be sacrificed for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>greater good of the show.</v>

2619

01:53:29.161 --> 01:53:30.270
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that develop</v>

2643
01:53:30.310 --> 01:53:32.570
<v Speaker 1>mine of material must be done in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an audience.</v>

<v Speaker 1>notebook,</v>

2645
01:53:35.721 --> 01:53:39.110
<v Speaker 1>but the only way it really works out is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of a crowd.</v>

2646
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>roadmap from all your experience,</v>

2652
01:53:52.241 --> 01:53:54.100
<v Speaker 1>but until you do it in front of a live</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couple ideas.</v>

2662
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:21.103
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2663
01:54:21.290 --> 01:54:26.290
<v Speaker 2>so I watch it and he did align that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed like immediate,</v>

2664
01:54:28.401 --> 01:54:31.250
<v Speaker 2>like one of those things where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh for a split second and then</v>

2665
01:54:31.251 --> 01:54:32.480
<v Speaker 2>immediately applaud</v>

2666
01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:36.840
<v Speaker 4>like fuck labbing right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have to go immediately to applause.</v>

2667
01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:39.270
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was watching this and I was like,</v>

2668
01:54:39.330 --> 01:54:44.220
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even know that was a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I read it,</v>

2669
01:54:44.221 --> 01:54:45.810
<v Speaker 4>I was like my name though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a joke.</v>

2670
01:54:46.170 --> 01:54:50.040
<v Speaker 4>So I texted Malanie I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you,</v>

2671
01:54:50.130 --> 01:54:52.170
<v Speaker 4>was that a punchline to you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

2672
01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:55.530
<v Speaker 4>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea.</v>

2673
01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:59.050
<v Speaker 4>Two guys with a lot of experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no fucking idea.</v>

2674
01:54:59.051 --> 01:55:01.690
<v Speaker 4>And it got to like pause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>break like the bet,</v>

2675
01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:04.560
<v Speaker 4>the highlight of his part.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so didn't even know it was a</v>

2676
01:55:04.561 --> 01:55:05.460
<v Speaker 4>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

2677
01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:07.770
<v Speaker 4>and that's what an audience does that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't like,</v>

2678
01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.390
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now we're doing comedy.</v>

2679
01:55:09.391 --> 01:55:11.310
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was a straight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that was a,</v>

2680
01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:12.510
<v Speaker 4>just a metaphor.</v>

2681
01:55:12.810 --> 01:55:14.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an APP on my phone,</v>

2682
01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.260
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound app,</v>

2683
01:55:16.261 --> 01:55:18.270
<v Speaker 1>the voice notes App,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I,</v>

2684
01:55:18.271 --> 01:55:21.540
<v Speaker 1>you can look at it and you can edit the</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice notes.</v>

2685
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And when you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go into the edit mode,</v>

2686
01:55:23.881 --> 01:55:28.380
<v Speaker 1>you can see the spikes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going over this one bit and I</v>

2687
01:55:28.381 --> 01:55:33.090
<v Speaker 1>look and there's this giant fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>spike in this,</v>

2688
01:55:33.091 --> 01:55:35.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Harvey Weinstein bit that I have.</v>

2689
01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized that the giant spike</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that I didn't even know as</v>

2690
01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:43.050
<v Speaker 1>a punchline when I wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to set something else,</v>

2691
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:46.860
<v Speaker 1>but the way it played out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got the biggest fucking laugh of the</v>

2692
01:55:46.861 --> 01:55:48.780
<v Speaker 1>entire bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to act like you meant</v>

2693
01:55:48.781 --> 01:55:50.160
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that whole thing.</v>

2694
01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did that?</v>

2695
01:55:52.531 --> 01:55:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And then I got off stage and Tony</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hinchcliffe said he'd go do that fucking</v>

2696
01:55:55.351 --> 01:55:56.280
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so funny.</v>

2697
01:55:56.281 --> 01:55:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2698
01:55:57.331 --> 01:55:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know what it was going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be you.</v>

2699
01:55:59.740 --> 01:56:00.573
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't</v>

2700
01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:06.380
<v Speaker 2>with saying I w I there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did a thing that I was like that's a</v>

2701
01:56:07.011 --> 01:56:08.070
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2702
01:56:08.071 --> 01:56:11.550
<v Speaker 2>the thing I like that you said about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like sometimes just like rapist,</v>

2703
01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:12.600
<v Speaker 2>just look like rape.</v>

2704
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you're doing.</v>

2705
01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm hardly doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2706
01:56:17.551 --> 01:56:19.400
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't judge a book by its cover,</v>

2707
01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.710
<v Speaker 1>but he wrote some thinks you're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2708
01:56:24.110 --> 01:56:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it looks like you've rate look</v>

2709
01:56:25.911 --> 01:56:28.860
<v Speaker 1>sick fucking total piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean what a trap it would be if you</v>

2710
01:56:28.861 --> 01:56:30.840
<v Speaker 1>look like that and you weren't a piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of shit and you're like,</v>

2711
01:56:30.841 --> 01:56:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the sweetest guy ever.</v>

2712
01:56:33.190 --> 01:56:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2713
01:56:34.431 --> 01:56:38.110
<v Speaker 2>So there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's literally no knowing what you</v>

2714
01:56:38.111 --> 01:56:39.790
<v Speaker 2>know until you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no,</v>

2715
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:42.310
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird art form in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2716
01:56:42.311 --> 01:56:44.070
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to Chris Stapleton about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2717
01:56:44.071 --> 01:56:44.904
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2718
01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I was saying you write all your music</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you perform it to the audience.</v>

2719
01:56:49.501 --> 01:56:51.270
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

2720
01:56:51.271 --> 01:56:53.610
<v Speaker 1>for a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's so rare.</v>

2721
01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:57.000
<v Speaker 1>It's so rare that I write a bit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out perfect.</v>

2722
01:56:57.090 --> 01:56:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I bring it to the stage and it</v>

2723
01:56:58.831 --> 01:57:00.990
<v Speaker 1>literally mirrors what I wrote down.</v>

2724
01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:03.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean sometimes,</v>

2725
01:57:03.621 --> 01:57:07.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's also a thing,</v>

2726
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:12.310
<v Speaker 2>I was reading something or listening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>something where like your brain</v>

2727
01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:19.600
<v Speaker 2>adrenaline will make your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>do different shit meaning,</v>

2728
01:57:20.751 --> 01:57:24.670
<v Speaker 2>so you need to put your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to that address.</v>

2729
01:57:24.710 --> 01:57:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Like you can have the map,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have your plan,</v>

2730
01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:31.010
<v Speaker 2>but then adrenaline will be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you ever watch somebody,</v>

2731
01:57:31.011 --> 01:57:33.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2732
01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Dave did something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you say that?</v>

2733
01:57:35.151 --> 01:57:38.330
<v Speaker 2>DEF Comedy Jam 25th Anniversary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not very good,</v>

2734
01:57:38.450 --> 01:57:42.260
<v Speaker 2>but it's on that flex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the good,</v>

2735
01:57:42.261 --> 01:57:45.530
<v Speaker 2>it's not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a sequence where Chappelle and</v>

2736
01:57:45.531 --> 01:57:46.640
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he uglier on</v>

2737
01:57:48.230 --> 01:57:53.230
<v Speaker 2>and Chappelle is so fucking funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's truly breathtaking and he's</v>

2738
01:57:55.101 --> 01:57:59.690
<v Speaker 2>improvising the whole thing and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like so fucking breathtaking.</v>

2739
01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:01.550
<v Speaker 2>And I was there with Jimmy Carr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the comedian.</v>

2740
01:58:01.551 --> 01:58:03.920
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is like when I'm impressed by</v>

2741
01:58:03.921 --> 01:58:05.390
<v Speaker 2>David's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he must,</v>

2742
01:58:05.391 --> 01:58:07.940
<v Speaker 2>cause I fucking know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them was like this motherfucker</v>

2743
01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:09.230
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's like,</v>

2744
01:58:09.231 --> 01:58:11.240
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't discount.</v>

2745
01:58:11.241 --> 01:58:15.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't assume that you couldn't have done</v>
<v Speaker 2>something because adrenaline does make</v>

2746
01:58:15.681 --> 01:58:19.760
<v Speaker 2>your brain do shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of makes it like superhuman and</v>

2747
01:58:19.761 --> 01:58:23.960
<v Speaker 2>super like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like make logic leaps that you wouldn't.</v>

2748
01:58:24.590 --> 01:58:26.000
<v Speaker 2>But I um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my,</v>

2749
01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:30.470
<v Speaker 2>in my line of work and like my eye,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be 10% ultimately of</v>

2750
01:58:30.471 --> 01:58:33.980
<v Speaker 2>like it's 90% written and then I'll 10%</v>
<v Speaker 2>say come up with some on stage.</v>

2751
01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2752
01:58:35.331 --> 01:58:37.120
<v Speaker 1>when I'm intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2753
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:40.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more willing to take these big leaps</v>

2754
01:58:40.480 --> 01:58:42.340
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go into new rooms,</v>

2755
01:58:42.670 --> 01:58:44.720
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take new new pass office stuff.</v>

2756
01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll take a wild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially marijuana,</v>

2757
01:58:47.470 --> 01:58:50.580
<v Speaker 1>like there's something about being high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I'm doing a bit and</v>

2758
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:52.360
<v Speaker 1>especially a new bit where I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2759
01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:54.560
<v Speaker 1>what about his mom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck,</v>

2760
01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:56.830
<v Speaker 1>how's his mom feel about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2761
01:58:56.831 --> 01:58:58.630
<v Speaker 1>That bitch has got to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did I do?</v>

2762
01:58:58.810 --> 01:59:00.760
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll have this whole nother</v>

2763
01:59:00.761 --> 01:59:05.761
<v Speaker 1>angle that it's almost like in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment it shows itself and then you have</v>

2764
01:59:06.591 --> 01:59:08.090
<v Speaker 1>to chase it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the courage,</v>

2765
01:59:08.091 --> 01:59:10.580
<v Speaker 1>chase it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in front of a bunch of people that</v>

2766
01:59:10.581 --> 01:59:12.200
<v Speaker 1>paid to hear you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2767
01:59:12.750 --> 01:59:16.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's the risk you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where a hubris comes in.</v>

2768
01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:17.661
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2769
01:59:17.661 --> 01:59:18.800
<v Speaker 1>That's where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2770
01:59:18.830 --> 01:59:20.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you paid.</v>

2771
01:59:20.330 --> 01:59:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2772
01:59:21.740 --> 01:59:23.300
<v Speaker 1>well this is how it's got to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2773
01:59:23.370 --> 01:59:26.030
<v Speaker 1>One of the good things about comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>today is because of all these kinds of</v>

2774
01:59:26.031 --> 01:59:28.490
<v Speaker 1>conversations that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people sort of understand the process</v>

2775
01:59:28.491 --> 01:59:30.830
<v Speaker 1>and particularly quality store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2776
01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:34.550
<v Speaker 1>They want to see the process play out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've talked to a guy the other day</v>

2777
01:59:34.730 --> 01:59:35.750
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2778
01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I came to see you while you were doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Bruce Jenner thing and I saw it</v>

2779
01:59:40.221 --> 01:59:43.790
<v Speaker 1>through all its incarnations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the early part was kind of clunky</v>

2780
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:45.710
<v Speaker 1>and then I saw where it became the</v>
<v Speaker 1>finished thing,</v>

2781
01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:47.360
<v Speaker 1>which is your clothes and bid on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

2782
01:59:47.690 --> 01:59:49.760
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you over a period of like three</v>

2783
01:59:49.761 --> 01:59:51.140
<v Speaker 1>times over eight months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

2784
01:59:51.141 --> 01:59:52.460
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2785
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Like they like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're comping nerds.</v>

2786
01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:55.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2787
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Ship held.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinks that's because of alternative</v>

2788
01:59:58.891 --> 02:00:03.510
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He believes that one of the great things</v>

2789
02:00:03.511 --> 02:00:08.511
<v Speaker 2>about alt comedy was it brought people</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the process.</v>

2790
02:00:10.350 --> 02:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>I think he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's all it's that in podcasts.</v>

2791
02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think podcasts more so cause obviously</v>

2792
02:00:15.331 --> 02:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>way more people listen to podcasts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to see alternative comedy shows.</v>

2793
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you have one or two</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative comedy shows in the city,</v>

2794
02:00:22.590 --> 02:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in La,</v>

2795
02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many are going on at night?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>

2796
02:00:26.280 --> 02:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So you've got like what 900 people maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are seeing alternative comedy and a</v>

2797
02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas podcasts thousands and thousands</v>

2798
02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>and thousands if not millions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions.</v>

2799
02:00:36.300 --> 02:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a bunch of things</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on though too.</v>

2800
02:00:38.521 --> 02:00:43.521
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you become a fan of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm a fan of music and I don't</v>

2801
02:00:43.711 --> 02:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>really like one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>having Chris Stapleton and I just wanted</v>

2802
02:00:47.341 --> 02:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>to ask him like how do you write jokes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where they come from.</v>

2803
02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I always ask that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a dumb question but it's like</v>

2804
02:00:52.860 --> 02:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any idea what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2805
02:00:56.291 --> 02:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>I said jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I meant songs.</v>

2806
02:00:57.490 --> 02:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2807
02:00:58.060 --> 02:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>how do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does the music come from?</v>

2808
02:01:00.121 --> 02:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Do you have like a beat in your head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2809
02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>and his answer was there's a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways he does it.</v>

2810
02:01:05.431 --> 02:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you just sit in his car and</v>

2811
02:01:07.171 --> 02:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>the thought just comes to him and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts singing into his phone.</v>

2812
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2813
02:01:10.740 --> 02:01:11.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

2814
02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:15.990
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malanie did a joke or it's like an</v>

2815
02:01:15.991 --> 02:01:17.580
<v Speaker 2>anecdote in his act,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I won't,</v>

2816
02:01:17.610 --> 02:01:21.450
<v Speaker 2>I won't blow it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like Mick Jagger was hosting snl and</v>

2817
02:01:21.570 --> 02:01:25.270
<v Speaker 2>some Malania was writing a song with him</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2818
02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Malanie pitched something and Mick</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jagger goes</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're not trying to benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not trying to sell the good word.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're literally just being soupy of</v>

2844

<v Speaker 2>Have you noticed that creep of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I've,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

2847
02:02:52.511 --> 02:02:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying this like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I can think of what Joe,</v>

2848
02:02:54.970 --> 02:02:56.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like are there moments</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're like,</v>

2849
02:02:56.710 --> 02:02:57.280
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2850
02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:59.110
<v Speaker 2>cause I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2851
02:02:59.380 --> 02:03:02.260
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're more popular than,</v>

2852
02:03:02.290 --> 02:03:03.123
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2853
02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:05.800
<v Speaker 2>than I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just wondering like have you</v>

2854
02:03:05.801 --> 02:03:09.700
<v Speaker 2>noticed anything uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happening then you were like,</v>

2855
02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:10.330
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2856
02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be careful of it for sure.</v>

2857
02:03:12.431 --> 02:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I felt it a lot more when I was</v>

2858
02:03:14.291 --> 02:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>younger or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2859
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:18.303
<v Speaker 1>just dumber.</v>

2860
02:03:19.730 --> 02:03:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I think you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just always aware.</v>

2861
02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing that you could do as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic is lose your objectivity.</v>

2862
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Objectivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have let it slip away instead of let</v>

2863
02:03:31.431 --> 02:03:34.400
<v Speaker 1>it increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in order to be a good comic,</v>

2864
02:03:34.401 --> 02:03:39.320
<v Speaker 1>you have to be introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Africa until it's very subjective.</v>

2865
02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until you're sure of it.</v>

2866
02:03:41.410 --> 02:03:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>

2867
02:03:42.351 --> 02:03:43.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>

2868
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:45.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where that he was going to then.</v>

2869
02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2871
02:03:50.150 --> 02:03:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's one of the reasons why I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like pot because it makes me insecure.</v>

2872
02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legitimately I like,</v>

2873

<v Speaker 1>ever like insecure define insecure</v>

2874
02:04:01.190 --> 02:04:03.830
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like insecure about the future,</v>

2875
02:04:03.831 --> 02:04:06.170
<v Speaker 1>about life itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About like realizing like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

2878
02:04:09.021 --> 02:04:12.620

<v Speaker 1>The cells in my body literally only have</v>

2879
02:04:12.621 --> 02:04:15.590
<v Speaker 1>about 50 years will left of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm lucky.</v>

2880

<v Speaker 1>worrying about my family,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2885
02:04:24.981 --> 02:04:25.421

<v Speaker 1>highlighted by marijuana.</v>

2887
02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the awareness of your own imminent</v>

2888
02:04:32.601 --> 02:04:36.470
<v Speaker 1>demise and just life itself being so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Uber Bizarre.</v>

2889
02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Like all those are highlighted</v>

2890
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:40.350
<v Speaker 3>by marijuana and which is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>things I like about it,</v>

2891
02:04:40.650 --> 02:04:45.650
<v Speaker 3>that ruthless introspective quality of</v>
<v Speaker 3>pot that people call paranoia.</v>

2892
02:04:46.411 --> 02:04:47.700
<v Speaker 3>I get paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2893
02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:52.730
<v Speaker 3>I just think that's hyper awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is why like hugs feel so good when</v>

2894
02:04:53.161 --> 02:04:55.260
<v Speaker 3>you're high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're high and you hug somebody,</v>

2895
02:04:55.261 --> 02:04:55.920
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2896
02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.860
<v Speaker 3>give me a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I just feel so much better.</v>

2897
02:04:58.861 --> 02:05:01.260
<v Speaker 3>It feels so warm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like food feels better.</v>

2898
02:05:01.261 --> 02:05:03.330
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're way more aware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work out.</v>

2899
02:05:03.331 --> 02:05:06.450
<v Speaker 3>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of my favorite things to do is I did</v>

2900
02:05:06.451 --> 02:05:07.920
<v Speaker 3>it yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had this meeting here.</v>

2901
02:05:07.921 --> 02:05:09.510
<v Speaker 3>I did a podcast and then have to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting.</v>

2902
02:05:09.840 --> 02:05:10.673
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2903
02:05:10.740 --> 02:05:15.660
<v Speaker 3>I had like two hours before the meeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I smoked a joint and I hit the bag.</v>

2904
02:05:15.690 --> 02:05:18.330
<v Speaker 3>I just went over to the heavy bag and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out for like 45 minutes.</v>

2905
02:05:18.331 --> 02:05:21.630
<v Speaker 3>And just man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're so aware of all the</v>

2906
02:05:21.631 --> 02:05:25.050
<v Speaker 3>muscle tissue moving you like feel your</v>
<v Speaker 3>body different.</v>

2907
02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:26.580
<v Speaker 3>It like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for me,</v>

2908
02:05:26.581 --> 02:05:29.040
<v Speaker 3>like for martial arts techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

2909
02:05:29.041 --> 02:05:33.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm really aware of the correct way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>utilize leverage and weight.</v>

2910
02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:36.390
<v Speaker 3>It all comes together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just hyper awareness that</v>

2911
02:05:36.391 --> 02:05:41.340
<v Speaker 3>hyperawareness also makes you like hyper</v>
<v Speaker 3>focused on yourself and your flaws and</v>

2912
02:05:41.730 --> 02:05:43.420
<v Speaker 3>the way you interact with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I all,</v>

2913
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I never feel confident when I smoke a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of pot.</v>

2914
02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:52.380
<v Speaker 3>I always feel vulnerable and I always</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel like I should apologize to people</v>

2915
02:05:52.381 --> 02:05:54.540
<v Speaker 3>for something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always like something that happened</v>

2916
02:05:54.541 --> 02:05:55.560
<v Speaker 3>like a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2917
02:05:55.561 --> 02:05:56.460
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was I a dick.</v>

2918
02:05:56.590 --> 02:05:58.560
<v Speaker 2>You feel like a woman basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2919
02:05:58.710 --> 02:06:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Feel emotional or more vulnerable in</v>
<v Speaker 2>woman.</v>

2920
02:06:00.871 --> 02:06:03.420
<v Speaker 2>Constantly apologetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the reasons why a lot</v>

2921
02:06:03.421 --> 02:06:03.610
<v Speaker 2>of fun,</v>

2922
02:06:03.610 --> 02:06:05.920
<v Speaker 3>but don't think of marijuana as being a</v>
<v Speaker 3>manly thing.</v>

2923
02:06:05.921 --> 02:06:08.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is like very feminine and a</v>

2924
02:06:08.021 --> 02:06:12.100
<v Speaker 3>lot of ways very nurturing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really a community sort of a drug</v>

2925
02:06:12.370 --> 02:06:15.130
<v Speaker 3>in the sense that it's not something you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to be by herself with.</v>

2926
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:18.040
<v Speaker 3>It's something you want to be like with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a community of friends.</v>

2927
02:06:18.041 --> 02:06:19.330
<v Speaker 3>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it makes you very,</v>

2928
02:06:19.850 --> 02:06:21.940
<v Speaker 3>it makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a friendly drug.</v>

2929
02:06:22.190 --> 02:06:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I realized.</v>

2930
02:06:23.570 --> 02:06:24.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really,</v>

2931
02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:29.980
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got drunk in 2005 and I realize like,</v>

2932
02:06:30.380 --> 02:06:32.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the value I,</v>

2933
02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:35.200
<v Speaker 2>what I realized is it's all of us sit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2934
02:06:35.290 --> 02:06:40.010
<v Speaker 2>in a row boat and we just slowly shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>holes in the boat and we all just slowly</v>

2935
02:06:40.011 --> 02:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>sink at the same,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just getting dry and you're just</v>

2936
02:06:42.471 --> 02:06:44.720
<v Speaker 2>sinking and sinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing it together.</v>

2937
02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:48.560
<v Speaker 2>So it's like nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what it sounds like.</v>

2938
02:06:48.561 --> 02:06:49.580
<v Speaker 2>You're describing weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2939
02:06:49.660 --> 02:06:51.430
<v Speaker 2>well Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being honorable,</v>

2940
02:06:51.460 --> 02:06:54.080
<v Speaker 2>collected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the alcohol is going to come at a</v>

2941
02:06:54.081 --> 02:06:56.510
<v Speaker 2>price.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no real price for the weed.</v>

2942
02:06:56.590 --> 02:06:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me at least I don't have the price</v>

2943
02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:00.710
<v Speaker 3>when it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel fine.</v>

2944
02:07:00.740 --> 02:07:01.573
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like,</v>

2945
02:07:01.970 --> 02:07:02.691
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

02:09:34.610 --> 02:09:36.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

3004
02:09:36.580 --> 02:09:37.321
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

3005
02:09:37.321 --> 02:09:41.380
<v Speaker 2>So then the problem was after that I did</v>
<v Speaker 2>hgh for someone gave me some hgh and I</v>

3006
02:09:41.381 --> 02:09:41.780
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3007
02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:43.240
<v Speaker 2>I'll fucking take you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give a shit.</v>

3008
02:09:43.330 --> 02:09:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a shit.</v>

3009
02:09:44.530 --> 02:09:49.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm always looking for an advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started having panic attacks from</v>

3010
02:09:49.061 --> 02:09:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Hga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3011
02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:51.041
<v Speaker 2>Which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

3012
02:09:51.041 --> 02:09:54.640
<v Speaker 2>it's a narrow side effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's one of the side effects of hgh.</v>

3013
02:09:54.940 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It like supercharged my whole system.</v>

3014
02:09:58.150 --> 02:10:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I started having panic attacks on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a panic attack the night before.</v>

3015
02:10:02.711 --> 02:10:06.000
<v Speaker 2>I take three mikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why couldn't go onstage?</v>

3016
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Spade was supposed to bring me on and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>told Adam,</v>

3017
02:10:09.131 --> 02:10:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't go on.</v>

3018
02:10:11.050 --> 02:10:14.620
<v Speaker 2>I literally couldn't breathe well night</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

3019
02:10:14.630 --> 02:10:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3020
02:10:17.090 --> 02:10:18.970
<v Speaker 2>thankfully it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3021
02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I thankfully didn't get one that night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3022
02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:22.570
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3023
02:10:22.690 --> 02:10:24.850
<v Speaker 2>trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trust me.</v>

3024
02:10:24.851 --> 02:10:28.690
<v Speaker 2>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I had anxiety for months.</v>

3025
02:10:28.840 --> 02:10:31.360
<v Speaker 2>Literally like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like when people say I have</v>

3026
02:10:31.361 --> 02:10:32.890
<v Speaker 2>anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never had,</v>

3027
02:10:33.230 --> 02:10:34.010
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an</v>

3028
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:35.930
<v Speaker 4>anxious person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't even know what that's like.</v>

3029
02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:38.450
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking miserable.</v>

3030
02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:40.850
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me it was worse than depression</v>

3031
02:10:40.851 --> 02:10:45.851
<v Speaker 4>because you're agitated and like you</v>
<v Speaker 4>just feel like static.</v>

3032
02:10:46.731 --> 02:10:49.760
<v Speaker 4>It just was like a static over your</v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

3033
02:10:49.761 --> 02:10:50.594
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3034
02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:53.540
<v Speaker 4>you just have like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like cortisol,</v>

3035
02:10:54.110 --> 02:10:57.290
<v Speaker 4>snow in your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's sucked.</v>

3036
02:10:57.350 --> 02:11:01.100
<v Speaker 4>So I went back on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a Zoloft,</v>

3037
02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:02.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

3038
02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:07.130
<v Speaker 4>and then it ended the anxiety now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you are trying to get yourself off</v>

3039
02:11:07.131 --> 02:11:08.870
<v Speaker 4>of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So now I'm going to go,</v>

3040
02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:10.490
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm back on,</v>

3041

<v Speaker 4>How did you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel actually really good because,</v>

3043
02:11:16.610 --> 02:11:17.720

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3045

<v Speaker 4>before they happen.</v>

3068
02:12:25.910 --> 02:12:27.860
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

3069
02:12:27.861 --> 02:12:29.810
<v Speaker 4>some sort of psychic ability when he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>sparring,</v>

3070
02:12:30.110 --> 02:12:32.300
<v Speaker 4>like he sees what guys are doing and if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you watch him fight,</v>

3071
02:12:32.301 --> 02:12:35.690

<v Speaker 4>so I've been,</v>

3074
02:12:39.250 --> 02:12:41.990
<v Speaker 4>I stopped taking it the love because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3078
02:12:48.590 --> 02:12:51.830
<v Speaker 4>you risk serotonin syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like it too much serotonin in</v>

3079
02:12:51.831 --> 02:12:53.040
<v Speaker 4>your body or yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3080
02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:58.250
<v Speaker 4>So we're the first guy that tell me</v>
<v Speaker 4>about five htp before we even started</v>

3081
02:12:58.251 --> 02:13:00.950
<v Speaker 4>selling it at all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before we started having a mood.</v>

3082
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:04.100
<v Speaker 4>You were telling me about five htp and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you were sandy.</v>

3083
02:13:04.101 --> 02:13:06.260
<v Speaker 4>Dan told me about no shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3084
02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Cause I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he saw me some ecstasy and he was like,</v>

3085
02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:12.830
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and also take this the next day.</v>

3086
02:13:13.070 --> 02:13:13.650
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

3087
02:13:13.650 --> 02:13:15.260
<v Speaker 4>And then I like research and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3088
02:13:15.261 --> 02:13:18.280
<v Speaker 4>I should just take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I still take that five HDP.</v>

3089
02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:20.960
<v Speaker 4>I think it's good for weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

3090
02:13:21.050 --> 02:13:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it like when I take five htp,</v>

3091
02:13:23.511 --> 02:13:25.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm just not hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3092
02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:30.940
<v Speaker 4>it like that was the other sort of weird</v>
<v Speaker 4>side effect of the microdosing my</v>

3093
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:35.940
<v Speaker 4>appetite went down like significantly</v>
<v Speaker 4>across the board.</v>

3094
02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:38.370
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much of the appetite is not really</v>

3095
02:13:38.371 --> 02:13:42.120
<v Speaker 4>how much food you need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but rather you need something to do.</v>

3096
02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:46.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or it's just like at this time of day I</v>

3097
02:13:46.951 --> 02:13:48.860
<v Speaker 4>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3098
02:13:49.380 --> 02:13:52.890
<v Speaker 4>but I ended up like losing 10 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting to me.</v>

02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing with sugar is you don't need</v>

3119
02:14:40.141 --> 02:14:42.210
<v Speaker 4>it for three days if you don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3120
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:43.950
<v Speaker 4>Like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body doesn't like,</v>

3121
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:46.530
<v Speaker 4>you got to fucking get us some sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're just like,</v>

3122
02:14:46.531 --> 02:14:48.900
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm good once you cut free.</v>

3123
02:14:49.470 --> 02:14:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And especially if you're really</v>

3124
02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:55.770
<v Speaker 4>conscious about what you're eating in</v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of like probiotics and things that</v>

3125
02:14:55.800 --> 02:15:00.090
<v Speaker 4>sort of help the landscape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the biome landscape,</v>

3126
02:15:00.091 --> 02:15:02.280
<v Speaker 4>and make sure you've got healthy things</v>
<v Speaker 4>in there.</v>

3127
02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:06.090
<v Speaker 4>I think that's so significant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the more researchers that I talked</v>

3128
02:15:06.091 --> 02:15:10.080
<v Speaker 4>to and the more people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition experts to start talking about</v>

3129
02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:15.480
<v Speaker 4>your gut biome and how important it is</v>
<v Speaker 4>to take the proper probiotics.</v>

3130
02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it affects your personality.</v>

3131
02:15:17.281 --> 02:15:21.240
<v Speaker 4>I think it affects your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it affects virtually the path of</v>

3132
02:15:21.241 --> 02:15:24.450
<v Speaker 4>your life that you take depending upon</v>
<v Speaker 4>what foods you eat.</v>

3133
02:15:24.630 --> 02:15:27.150
<v Speaker 4>It has a different effect on how you</v>
<v Speaker 4>live your life.</v>

3134
02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:28.200
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's meditation.</v>

3135
02:15:28.201 --> 02:15:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Does the same thing cause you're like</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get a feeling for meditation and</v>

3136
02:15:32.971 --> 02:15:36.210
<v Speaker 4>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do I want to spoil this with like</v>

3137
02:15:36.211 --> 02:15:39.080
<v Speaker 4>garbage thinking or behavior like</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming?</v>

3138
02:15:39.090 --> 02:15:42.780
<v Speaker 4>Just try to bring a bit of that in here</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my every day.</v>

3139
02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:45.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the tank for me.</v>

3140
02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tank is literally forgot about tanks</v>

3141
02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:54.210
<v Speaker 4>until you and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live like a block from float lab.</v>

3142
02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:56.250
<v Speaker 4>You got to go like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

3143
02:15:56.340 --> 02:15:58.440
<v Speaker 4>I went.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you must.</v>

3144
02:15:58.441 --> 02:16:03.300
<v Speaker 4>How long have you been doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>2002 was the first time I got one.</v>

3145
02:16:03.450 --> 02:16:05.760
<v Speaker 4>When,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when did you start doing the podcast?</v>

3146
02:16:07.170 --> 02:16:10.950
<v Speaker 4>I think you told me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You told me about it.</v>

3147
02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:15.900
<v Speaker 4>I went to float lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had the thought in the,</v>

3148
02:16:16.170 --> 02:16:18.990
<v Speaker 4>in the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to love something.</v>

3149
02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:22.260
<v Speaker 4>Literally that was the thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an and then I got a dog.</v>

3150
02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:26.430
<v Speaker 4>Literally like he's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking,</v>

3151
02:16:26.550 --> 02:16:27.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>

3152
02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:29.710
<v Speaker 4>that I'd like that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3153
02:16:29.711 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 4>and I just</v>

3154
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:32.950
<v Speaker 2>forget that it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tanks.</v>

3155
02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3156
02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I think they're giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's only one of them.</v>

3157
02:16:35.510 --> 02:16:37.080
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that requires</v>

3158
02:16:37.081 --> 02:16:39.810
<v Speaker 1>you to block off a chunk of your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a busy person,</v>

3159
02:16:39.811 --> 02:16:40.644
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3160
02:16:40.710 --> 02:16:42.510
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it's like one of the most</v>

3161
02:16:42.511 --> 02:16:44.480
<v Speaker 1>important things you could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often you do it?</v>

3162
02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it a long time because I</v>

3163
02:16:47.280 --> 02:16:50.160
<v Speaker 1>took the one out of my basement and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had it installed here.</v>

3164
02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took me a few,</v>

3165
02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:54.660
<v Speaker 1>a few times off and we just got it put</v>
<v Speaker 1>in two days ago.</v>

3166
02:16:54.661 --> 02:16:58.140
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't even been in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I haven't been a tank at all and</v>

3167
02:16:58.260 --> 02:16:59.490
<v Speaker 1>three months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

3168
02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:00.900

<v Speaker 1>two months,</v>

3169
02:17:00.901 --> 02:17:02.760
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often do you think you'll do it now?</v>

3170
02:17:03.380 --> 02:17:05.700
<v Speaker 1>A couple of days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple days a week is good.</v>

3171
02:17:05.701 --> 02:17:07.800
<v Speaker 1>If I give myself two days a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy.</v>

3172
02:17:08.460 --> 02:17:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever go in and just think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>your daughters?</v>

3173
02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

<v Speaker 1>so it's not,</v>

3176
02:17:15.450 --> 02:17:18.630

<v Speaker 1>Sometimes I have a plan,</v>

3177
02:17:18.631 --> 02:17:21.990
<v Speaker 1>like maybe I'll have a bit that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to work out and I just like this</v>

3179
02:17:23.221 --> 02:17:26.400
<v Speaker 1>There's a part of it that's clunky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll smoke some pot and climbing that</v>

3180
02:17:26.401 --> 02:17:27.770
<v Speaker 1>tank and think about it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he throw up?</v>

3233
02:19:51.561 --> 02:19:52.820
<v Speaker 1>If it's longer it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll,</v>

3234
02:19:52.821 --> 02:19:56.410
<v Speaker 1>I've taken him on a 20 minute ride</v>
<v Speaker 1>before and eventually it'll chuck he's,</v>

3235
02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:58.040
<v Speaker 1>he gets,</v>

3236
02:19:58.280 --> 02:20:02.750
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that picture of somebody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape took a selfie while their dog was</v>

3237
02:20:02.751 --> 02:20:04.910
<v Speaker 1>throwing up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3240
02:20:09.711 --> 02:20:11.510

<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

3241
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:16.870
<v Speaker 1>They are lovely dogs there are so sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just like bundles of affection</v>

3242
02:20:18.561 --> 02:20:20.660
<v Speaker 1>and happiness and he's smart man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He wants you to like him.</v>

3245
02:20:25.611 --> 02:20:29.150
<v Speaker 1>He wants you to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like when he finds the things</v>

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3249
02:20:34.610 --> 02:20:36.260
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

3250
02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:37.730
<v Speaker 1>There's such good dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3251
02:20:38.330 --> 02:20:39.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a bunch of different kinds of</v>

3252
02:20:39.891 --> 02:20:44.750
<v Speaker 1>dogs in my life and I'm a big dog fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just particularly impressed with</v>

3253
02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:46.700
<v Speaker 1>golden retrievers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so nice.</v>

3254
02:20:47.540 --> 02:20:50.120
<v Speaker 1>And he's so great with my kids too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

3255
02:20:50.390 --> 02:20:52.640
<v Speaker 1>He just a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big love.</v>

3256
02:20:52.650 --> 02:20:54.410
<v Speaker 1>But my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got Jamie.</v>

3257
02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3258
02:20:58.591 --> 02:21:00.770
<v Speaker 1>That picture is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She caught the dog.</v>

3259
02:21:00.771 --> 02:21:04.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe made her God damn hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

3260
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:07.400
<v Speaker 1>my dog threw up while I was taking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfie.</v>

3261
02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:12.020
<v Speaker 1>The Gal's name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

3262
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:15.320
<v Speaker 1>uh Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3264
02:21:17.180 --> 02:21:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few.</v>

3265
02:21:17.870 --> 02:21:19.730

<v Speaker 1>what does it say up there?</v>

3266
02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Lie like a light l y kke underscore L.</v>

<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>

3268
02:21:28.761 --> 02:21:32.360
<v Speaker 1>That made me laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is pretty fucking funny.</v>

3269
02:21:32.540 --> 02:21:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of dog yet?</v>

3270
02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Pitbull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3271
02:21:35.361 --> 02:21:36.930
<v Speaker 1>there was another thing when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what else helps</v>

3272
02:21:37.120 --> 02:21:39.580
<v Speaker 2>with negative thoughts is a thing called</v>
<v Speaker 2>a murder.</v>

3273
02:21:40.980 --> 02:21:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3274
02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:43.670
<v Speaker 1>he kills homeless people for you.</v>

3275
02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:48.080
<v Speaker 2>Cognitive behavioral therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3276
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:50.360
<v Speaker 2>and it was basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

3277
02:21:52.340 --> 02:21:53.480
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this made me laugh.</v>

3278
02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so dead on.</v>

3279
02:21:55.460 --> 02:21:58.940
<v Speaker 2>They just have think it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just an unhelpful thinking styles.</v>

3280
02:21:59.530 --> 02:21:59.991
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>

3281
02:21:59.991 --> 02:22:01.970
<v Speaker 2>you can bring this up to actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3282
02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a chart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is all or nothing thinking a</v>

3283
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:08.630
<v Speaker 2>or black and white thinking something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3284
02:22:08.631 --> 02:22:10.460
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've failed.</v>

3285
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:14.390
<v Speaker 2>Either I do it right or not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like dumb shit.</v>

3286
02:22:14.391 --> 02:22:16.670
<v Speaker 2>So anytime I think these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to know you're</v>

3287
02:22:16.671 --> 02:22:18.650
<v Speaker 2>disqualified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you gotta go.</v>

3288
02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:21.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A mental filter only paying attention to</v>

3289
02:22:21.531 --> 02:22:23.900
<v Speaker 2>certain types of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3290
02:22:23.901 --> 02:22:27.150
<v Speaker 2>noticing our failures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not seeing our successes.</v>

3291
02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Jumping to conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3292
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:37.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

3293
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Thinking over generalizing everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>always rubbish.</v>

3294
02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:44.460
<v Speaker 2>No comedy ever happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these are literally just like</v>

3295
02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:46.740
<v Speaker 2>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you make comedy?</v>

3296
02:22:46.741 --> 02:22:48.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to exaggerate jumped to</v>

3297
02:22:48.721 --> 02:22:52.620
<v Speaker 2>conclusions yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're re they can be really</v>

3298
02:22:52.621 --> 02:22:56.340
<v Speaker 2>destructive on a personal level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3299
02:22:56.370 --> 02:22:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For sure.</v>

3300
02:22:57.860 --> 02:22:58.250
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

3301
02:22:58.250 --> 02:23:02.150
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody needs something</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do on top of what they</v>

3302
02:23:02.151 --> 02:23:04.970
<v Speaker 1>already do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my theory about standup comedy.</v>

3303
02:23:05.490 --> 02:23:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

3304
02:23:06.410 --> 02:23:10.580
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways that I've sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tighten up my game over the last few</v>

3305
02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:13.430
<v Speaker 1>years is to concentrate on difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>things outside of comedy.</v>

3306
02:23:13.930 --> 02:23:15.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's martial arts or whether</v>

3307
02:23:15.921 --> 02:23:19.910
<v Speaker 1>it's a yoga or bow hunting is another</v>
<v Speaker 1>one for me.</v>

3308
02:23:20.150 --> 02:23:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Doing things that are very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes comedy a little bit easier.</v>

3309
02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:26.570
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's relatively easier.</v>

3310
02:23:26.750 --> 02:23:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Relatively easier.</v>

3311
02:23:28.521 --> 02:23:31.520
<v Speaker 1>But also you recognize like just didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

3312
02:23:31.521 --> 02:23:35.330
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem like bow hunting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>standup comedy would ever go together,</v>

3313
02:23:35.630 --> 02:23:40.010
<v Speaker 1>but the way they go together as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an absolute reality in bow hunting</v>

3314
02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:44.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's fucking really difficult to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in doing that,</v>

3315
02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it just helps you manage the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties of standup better.</v>

3316
02:23:47.680 --> 02:23:50.750
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like Jujitsu helped me a lot with</v>

3317
02:23:50.751 --> 02:23:55.670
<v Speaker 1>stand up and martial arts in general</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Jujitsu is so much more</v>

3318
02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:59.870
<v Speaker 1>difficult to do than comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like physically difficult.</v>

3319
02:23:59.871 --> 02:24:02.960
<v Speaker 1>Like as you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're groaning and strengthen and,</v>

3320
02:24:03.020 --> 02:24:08.020
<v Speaker 1>and straining and just barely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>barely surviving certain situations and</v>

3321
02:24:08.420 --> 02:24:11.450
<v Speaker 1>getting into positions where people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally squeezing your fucking neck</v>

3322
02:24:11.451 --> 02:24:12.900
<v Speaker 1>and hear about to blackout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3323
02:24:12.990 --> 02:24:17.990
<v Speaker 1>And it just makes the uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling of anticipation of standup.</v>

3324
02:24:18.180 --> 02:24:22.370
<v Speaker 1>It just makes it less dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like less scary.</v>

3325
02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:26.270
<v Speaker 2>I did a show last night at the Fonda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

3326
02:24:26.271 --> 02:24:29.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know me theater,</v>

3327
02:24:29.240 --> 02:24:30.500
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>audience probably,</v>

3328
02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:32.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>800 people or something.</v>

3329
02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:37.280
<v Speaker 2>And by Dennis spot on Tuesday night</v>
<v Speaker 2>length.</v>

3330
02:24:37.281 --> 02:24:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done spots every night for the last</v>

3331
02:24:39.411 --> 02:24:44.411
<v Speaker 2>10 years in some degree of decent and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thoughts I was having before I went</v>

3332
02:24:45.201 --> 02:24:47.600
<v Speaker 2>on like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3333
02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:49.100
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to throw up on her,</v>

3334
02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:53.360
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to have a bad back</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw up on yourself.</v>

3335
02:24:53.361 --> 02:24:54.680
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3336
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:57.080
<v Speaker 2>why did you think that was going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>

3337
02:24:57.440 --> 02:24:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Fucking Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

3338
02:24:59.241 --> 02:25:03.080
<v Speaker 2>none of it even came close to happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your brain's just like,</v>

3339
02:25:03.090 --> 02:25:03.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3340
02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:04.140
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got to,</v>

3341
02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:06.920
<v Speaker 2>this is going to like this worst case</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenario.</v>

3342
02:25:06.921 --> 02:25:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Shit that's so impractical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that,</v>

3343
02:25:10.181 --> 02:25:11.840
<v Speaker 2>you know what's great and horrible at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa,</v>

3344
02:25:11.841 --> 02:25:13.940
<v Speaker 2>but somebody was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3345
02:25:14.120 --> 02:25:16.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't compare your spot.</v>

3346
02:25:16.310 --> 02:25:18.080
<v Speaker 2>You're set somebody else's and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3347

3492
02:31:20.740 --> 02:31:23.400
<v Speaker 3>I've had people come out to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be the only one.</v>

3493
02:31:23.401 --> 02:31:24.121
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>

3495
02:31:28.021 --> 02:31:31.530
<v Speaker 3>realized that that you just gotta be</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to ride the wave of Joe.</v>

3496
02:31:31.890 --> 02:31:34.050
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's like that with anybody.</v>

3497
02:31:34.250 --> 02:31:36.300
<v Speaker 3>The avant had to follow Chappelle the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other night and he was like,</v>

3498
02:31:36.301 --> 02:31:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3499
02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:38.190
<v Speaker 3>I was like scared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

3500
02:31:38.191 --> 02:31:40.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't be there.</v>

3501
02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:44.400
<v Speaker 3>So gacked from seeing somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 3>famous that they're like,</v>

3502
02:31:44.460 --> 02:31:47.130
<v Speaker 3>they just don't fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3503
02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.210
<v Speaker 3>If you're comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could ride the way.</v>

3504
02:31:49.211 --> 02:31:51.150
<v Speaker 3>But if you are insecure because Oh my</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

3505
02:31:51.151 --> 02:31:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going after Joey Diaz Shit and that</v>

3506
02:31:53.761 --> 02:31:58.080
<v Speaker 3>nervousness and that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took joy in the road of me once in New</v>

3507
02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:00.930
<v Speaker 3>Jersey and I bombed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the last time I bombed going</v>

3508
02:32:00.931 --> 02:32:05.280
<v Speaker 3>on after Joey and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went up and fucking murdered and he</v>

3509
02:32:05.281 --> 02:32:07.440
<v Speaker 3>was fucking with the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I forget what happened,</v>

3510
02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:10.350
<v Speaker 3>but I remember that feeling as I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>going up to the stage,</v>

3511
02:32:10.351 --> 02:32:13.740
<v Speaker 3>like this is not going to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to have all given me.</v>

3512
02:32:14.350 --> 02:32:19.350
<v Speaker 3>And it was a transitionary period in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>act where I was like not quite can have</v>

3513
02:32:19.681 --> 02:32:21.550
<v Speaker 3>the bits down yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still working.</v>

3514
02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:23.640
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

3515
02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:27.030
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's one of the reasons why I used</v>

3516
02:32:27.031 --> 02:32:29.070
<v Speaker 3>to love taking them with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't anymore because it's too</v>

3517

<v Speaker 2>I need people that are like fucking,</v>

3526
02:32:52.240 --> 02:32:56.290
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things where he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>already murdered them when he gets out</v>

3527
02:32:56.291 --> 02:33:01.150
<v Speaker 2>for like it's all so for high level it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>insane.</v>

3528
02:33:01.690 --> 02:33:04.030
<v Speaker 2>He also had a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his last special,</v>

3529
02:33:04.510 --> 02:33:07.870
<v Speaker 2>he fucked a joke up and kept it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

3530
02:33:07.900 --> 02:33:09.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh y'all never fucked up.</v>

3531
02:33:09.610 --> 02:33:13.020
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking really funny history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3532
02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:19.010
<v Speaker 2>That dude is fucked up a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3533
02:33:19.080 --> 02:33:20.540
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like a hag.</v>

3534
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:23.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a hacky thing to say other than he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way he did it was so fucking,</v>

3535
02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.100
<v Speaker 2>that's very smart of him to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To bring those guys with them.</v>

3536
02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Murder after murderer that's wise.</v>

3537
02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:32.380
<v Speaker 2>And then you have to fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>

3538
02:33:32.410 --> 02:33:37.180
<v Speaker 2>then you can't be like no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause it's like I don't care about fame.</v>

3539
02:33:37.181 --> 02:33:39.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know who that person was</v>

3540
02:33:39.890 --> 02:33:44.510
<v Speaker 3>and he's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that in is not just about comedy</v>

3541
02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:48.020
<v Speaker 3>and I think that relates to a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems that a lot of people have in</v>

3542
02:33:48.021 --> 02:33:51.470
<v Speaker 3>life with what you would call haters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like with a lot of haters are,</v>

3543
02:33:51.710 --> 02:33:54.830
<v Speaker 3>as they see people that are doing way</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than them,</v>

3544
02:33:55.010 --> 02:33:57.740
<v Speaker 3>they see things that are happening and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some things legitimately to</v>

3545
02:33:57.741 --> 02:33:58.650
<v Speaker 3>hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3546
02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:02.750
<v Speaker 3>But then there's a lot of haters that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are haters about athletes or about</v>

3547
02:34:03.230 --> 02:34:07.350
<v Speaker 3>singers or rappers or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it is just jealousy and the</v>

3548
02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:09.410
<v Speaker 3>that jealousy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they look at themselves,</v>

3549
02:34:09.411 --> 02:34:11.750
<v Speaker 3>they look at that person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't like the way they measure up.</v>

3550
02:34:11.751 --> 02:34:16.400
<v Speaker 3>And so all they can concentrate on is</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to find something wrong with that</v>

3551
02:34:16.401 --> 02:34:17.770
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like try</v>

3552
02:34:18.050 --> 02:34:21.760
<v Speaker 2>and not being instead inspired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3553
02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:26.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like being inspired is so much more</v>

3554
02:34:26.081 --> 02:34:29.470
<v Speaker 2>beneficial to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so much healthier and it's so much</v>

3555
02:34:29.471 --> 02:34:31.510
<v Speaker 2>more of a strong move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3556
02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:34.930
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not having,</v>

3557
02:34:35.290 --> 02:34:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of times with this like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard,</v>

3558
02:34:37.221 --> 02:34:39.250
<v Speaker 2>then it goes to that power thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some guys,</v>

3559
02:34:39.580 --> 02:34:44.580
<v Speaker 2>sometimes guys especially we'll see that</v>
<v Speaker 2>see their career is revenge.</v>

3560
02:34:46.480 --> 02:34:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is a little,</v>

3561
02:34:49.180 --> 02:34:51.760
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of that is worthwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

3562
02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I think it can poison a fucking chore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poison you if you're,</v>

3563
02:34:55.540 --> 02:34:58.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're consumed by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause there's guys that we all know that</v>

3564
02:34:58.091 --> 02:35:00.220
<v Speaker 2>are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they do is like,</v>

3565
02:35:00.221 --> 02:35:02.290
<v Speaker 2>just see what so and so got and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3566
02:35:02.291 --> 02:35:04.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys are useless.</v>

3567
02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It again,</v>

3568
02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:08.490
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't between you and him and the</v>

3569
02:35:08.491 --> 02:35:13.491
<v Speaker 2>taints their work to that mindset that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that limited growth mindset that fucks</v>

3570
02:35:14.261 --> 02:35:15.220
<v Speaker 2>with their work.</v>

3571
02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to be original and as good as you</v>

3572
02:35:19.211 --> 02:35:21.520
<v Speaker 2>pause somebody was the other night was</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaining like,</v>

3573

<v Speaker 2>my agent didn't.</v>

3574
02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:25.540
<v Speaker 2>He moved and he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't tell me and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3587
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:14.190
<v Speaker 2>then I write movies for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we do chappelle show still still</v>

3588
02:36:15.101 --> 02:36:15.934
<v Speaker 2>from Boston.</v>

3589
02:36:16.630 --> 02:36:20.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then then I'm like in Showbiz and</v>

3590
02:36:20.980 --> 02:36:25.980
<v Speaker 2>it's all like a direct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all the direct current from that.</v>

3591
02:36:26.970 --> 02:36:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Every commercial I direct commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all from,</v>

3592
02:36:30.070 --> 02:36:32.410
<v Speaker 2>that's from Chappelle show cause it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a long story.</v>

3593
02:36:32.411 --> 02:36:36.220
<v Speaker 2>But like the Air Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did things with them and then they</v>

3594
02:36:36.221 --> 02:36:37.300
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should do more commercial.</v>

3595
02:36:37.301 --> 02:36:41.800
<v Speaker 2>So I do commercial and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all from your peers.</v>

3596
02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:43.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's literally offering me periods.</v>

3597
02:36:43.391 --> 02:36:45.180
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only people that are gaining</v>

3598
02:36:45.181 --> 02:36:47.770
<v Speaker 2>get you that they're the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to hire you.</v>

3599
02:36:48.050 --> 02:36:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't like to think that way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think there's like this</v>

3600
02:36:50.771 --> 02:36:54.700
<v Speaker 2>embedded mindset that used to exist when</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a limited number of jobs.</v>

3601
02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:56.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was like only two guys could,</v>

3602
02:36:56.921 --> 02:36:57.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3603
02:36:57.730 --> 02:37:01.600
<v Speaker 2>one guy is going to be a competing</v>
<v Speaker 2>against someone else for the tonight</v>

3604
02:37:01.601 --> 02:37:02.980
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only one guy's going to get it.</v>

3605
02:37:03.050 --> 02:37:04.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not the case anymore.</v>

3606
02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:07.210
<v Speaker 2>There's so much above others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

3607
02:37:07.211 --> 02:37:09.790
<v Speaker 2>there's too much almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

3608
02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:13.820
<v Speaker 2>it's too much to keep up with like just</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the Netflix special,</v>

3609
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 2>can't watch all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I truly</v>

3610
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:17.540
<v Speaker 4>don't have time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how people do it.</v>

3611
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:19.810
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like the,</v>

3612
02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:23.300
<v Speaker 4>that's what it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's not being competitive</v>

3613
02:37:23.301 --> 02:37:26.720
<v Speaker 4>with people and supporting people and</v>
<v Speaker 4>being inspired by the people that are</v>

3614
02:37:26.721 --> 02:37:28.900
<v Speaker 4>really good fuel.</v>
