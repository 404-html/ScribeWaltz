00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.820
<v Speaker 1>but as an individual,</v>

3
00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>those jobs almost exist to let you know that you for sure don't want to do that.</v>

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It's like the feeling of it being,</v>

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like being in a real bad relationship,</v>

6
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.641
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

8
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>What gets you out of a relationship?</v>

9

<v Speaker 1>It he fucking explode.</v>

10
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

11
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>You get to a certain point where you like,</v>

12
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>will you just shut the fuck up and leave me alone?</v>

13
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't take it as negativity anymore.</v>

14
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>

15
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.393
<v Speaker 1>We're done here.</v>

16
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.493
<v Speaker 1>We boom.</v>

18
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to hit this.</v>

19
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>you got to hit the bottom 15 in order to change and you've got to have that</v>

21
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's job to appreciate a really good job.</v>

22
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>It's great to talk about later.</v>

23
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Like you and I,</v>

24
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>we talked about our first jobs.</v>

25
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>It gave you the motivation to get up,</v>

26
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>get on your fucking horse and get out of there.</v>

27
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't have that motivation,</v>

29
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's where when we're talking about money like our society designed to</v>

30
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>sort of encourage motivation which encourages success,</v>

31
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>which encourages financial rewards and encourages you more attractive to the</v>

32
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:58.980
<v Speaker 1>opposite sex when you're driving a Ferrari to a lot of checks.</v>

33
00:00:58.981 --> 00:00:59.581
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>

34
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people get really mad at that,</v>

35
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's a fact.</v>

36
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It's just the fact,</v>

37
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's just too many dudes who are ugly and old who have really hot</v>

38
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:07.591
<v Speaker 1>wives,</v>

39
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:07.801
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

40
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just fact.</v>

41
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Guys get billions of dollars in giant yachts and their fucking these hot chicks</v>

42
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't make any sense,</v>

43
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's a fact.</v>

44
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>You can't deny that fact.</v>

45
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Why is that fact exists?</v>

46
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>What exists?</v>

47
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Because we've got a weird system that a weird system and that's one of the holes</v>

48
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:22.374
<v Speaker 1>in the system.</v>

49
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>One of the holes in the system is that achievement as as superseded actual</v>

50
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>physical desire for a lot of these poor gold diggers and they let this wrinkly</v>

51
00:01:29.821 --> 00:01:34.821
<v Speaker 1>old cock sucker shoot his dry loads into you and you got to pretend you love it.</v>

52
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

53
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

54
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Putting them out,</v>

<v Speaker 1>up at Naga.</v>

57
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what you think and this old man fucking creeps on you and he doesn't</v>

58
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 1>shower on purpose just to degrade you for today.</v>

59
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>If it's all about the money.</v>

60
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:50.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

61
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>why did he suck?</v>

62
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Suck it now baby.</v>

63
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of guys that definitely have a resentment towards these</v>

65
00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>goaltenders.</v>

66
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

67
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:56.701
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

68
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Especially once the woman's,</v>

69
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>the fun has worn off of the game of pretending you're attracted to the man,</v>

70
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.510
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

71
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.630
<v Speaker 1>if you're a guy who's not attractive and you're successful and you believe in</v>

72
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>your head that you're something cool,</v>

73
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>there's something special about you.</v>

74
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Look how well I've done and this defines me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm just so lucky we met each other.</v>

80
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

108
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>kids would be better off if you didn't give them a safety net because that would</v>

109
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>make them successful like you.</v>

110

113
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about like Anna Nicole Smith when his fucking stupid kids want</v>

114
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 2>it as a state.</v>

<v Speaker 1>didn't you?</v>

119
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Still a bit about this.</v>

120
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.643
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

121

<v Speaker 1>closers 19 what was it?</v>

122
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.000
<v Speaker 1>What was the whole thing about them saying like,</v>

123
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.931
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

124
00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:55.310
<v Speaker 1>she's taking advantage of him.</v>

125
00:03:55.311 --> 00:03:56.120
<v Speaker 1>She's only been,</v>

126
00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.560
<v Speaker 1>she's only with him for his money.</v>

127
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.131
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

128
00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:02.930
<v Speaker 1>don't you think he fucking knows it kind of made $1 billion from scratch.</v>

129
00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Chances are he's a tad crafty and it was like this whole thing about like how</v>

130
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.730
<v Speaker 1>you want to die.</v>

131
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Do you'd want to get shaking and a low in your hospital bed surrounded by loved</v>

132
00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:16.301
<v Speaker 1>ones or do you want to get a big Fat Kentucky Fried Hooker and just blow it out?</v>

133
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.400
<v Speaker 1>And it was all him dying telling her to lick his ass.</v>

134
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:24.500
<v Speaker 1>All the different shit he did to her right before he died.</v>

135
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 1>And the kids if that nothing.</v>

136
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.320
<v Speaker 1>And they think they deserve.</v>

137
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.580
<v Speaker 2>You were raised with all that fucking money.</v>

138
00:04:29.581 --> 00:04:30.960
<v Speaker 2>You went to private schools,</v>

139
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:32.250
<v Speaker 2>you had tennis coaches,</v>

140
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>he probably bought you houses.</v>

141
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Why do you need more?</v>

142
00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:36.090
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck did you do?</v>

143
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:36.860
<v Speaker 2>You didn't suck.</v>

144
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

145
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>you need to get your own money.</v>

146
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Stupid.</v>

147
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.161
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

148
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>He rode the ride and now it's over.</v>

149
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 1>And I think also this,</v>

150
00:04:42.961 --> 00:04:43.960
<v Speaker 1>it sounds fucked up,</v>

151
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>but that exists because it's a predatory situation.</v>

152
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.020
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

153
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.853
<v Speaker 1>you're prey.</v>

154
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.591
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

155
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>if you are vulnerable,</v>

156
00:04:51.761 --> 00:04:52.211
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

157
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>weak,</v>

158
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>emotional guy who also has $1 billion,</v>

159
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>we weren't going to prey on you.</v>

160
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>They're going to pretend to be something they're not.</v>

161
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And they might even been convinced themselves that they are that something that</v>

162
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>they're pretending to be because their instinct to try to acquire your wealth</v>

163
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:10.861
<v Speaker 1>and your social status is so strong that they want to be the Trump girl.</v>

164
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>They want to be the new girl that Trump leaves his wife for</v>

165
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.631
<v Speaker 2>black and white.</v>

166
00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:15.871
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

167
00:05:15.871 --> 00:05:18.300
<v Speaker 2>if you're a woman that grew up in that paradigm,</v>

168
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:22.500
<v Speaker 2>maybe your dad had money and your mother was a stay at home mom and maybe she</v>

169
00:05:22.501 --> 00:05:26.610
<v Speaker 2>had a a a hint of that and then all of a sudden you're involved in charitable</v>

170
00:05:26.611 --> 00:05:29.160
<v Speaker 2>organizations and you're taking his wealth and you're,</v>

171
00:05:29.161 --> 00:05:31.920
<v Speaker 2>you're channeling it to positive things so you,</v>

172
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.720
<v Speaker 2>it starts to not necessarily be about is see the one I would've married just</v>

173
00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:39.660
<v Speaker 2>based on his looks and his charisma,</v>

174
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.430
<v Speaker 2>but it starts to become about like,</v>

175
00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:41.611
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

176
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:44.900
<v Speaker 2>life is pairing up with somebody and being powerful.</v>

177
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.530
<v Speaker 2>He watched house of cards.</v>

178
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.071
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

179
00:05:47.071 --> 00:05:47.491
<v Speaker 1>I haven't,</v>

180
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:47.761
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

181
00:05:47.761 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 1>don't you fucking spoiler alert me to say the relationship is about power.</v>

182
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.711
<v Speaker 1>I know that movie,</v>

183
00:05:52.711 --> 00:05:54.690
<v Speaker 1>the show brother is supposed to be amazing.</v>

184
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

185
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Jumping onto it next,</v>

186
00:05:56.761 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 1>but basically about how a couple can be together because there are a power</v>

187
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:02.150
<v Speaker 1>couple and it's interesting.</v>

188
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Bill and Hillary most likely,</v>

189
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:04.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

190
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

191
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>

192
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

193
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Mom,</v>

194
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>most presidents,</v>

195
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>I think probably you have to be,</v>

196
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can do that thing on your own.</v>

197
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a nutty fucking job.</v>

198
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And the first lady has a prominent role in our culture.</v>

199
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:14.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

200
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.901
<v Speaker 1>she's constantly speaking and doing these things and I think you're dead right.</v>

201
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I think you're dead right about that.</v>

202
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

203
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

204
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 1>it's also that we're also talking about just two stops on a broad range of</v>

205
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:33.731
<v Speaker 1>possibilities from ultimately totally evil Russian hot prostitute who steals</v>

206
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>your organs when you're asleep to someone who just doesn't want to work.</v>

207
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 1>And the guys kind of cool and he treats her good and so she stays with them.</v>

208
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

210
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:41.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

211
00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I've seen both.</v>

212
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.671
<v Speaker 1>I've seen both.</v>

213
00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>I've seen,</v>

214
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people get victimized and I've seen people that are just in sort of</v>

215
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 1>these relationship where I wouldn't want it,</v>

216
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>but it works for them.</v>

217
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they're out in the other one that the woman will tease and be like,</v>

218
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

219
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.113
<v Speaker 1>how'd he sat?</v>

220
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

221
00:06:56.601 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be with you if it wasn't for the fucking money.</v>

222
00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

223
00:06:58.971 --> 00:06:59.920
<v Speaker 1>it's not even a team.</v>

224
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:00.261
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

225
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:02.990
<v Speaker 1>of course I know that that's a movie that's in a movie.</v>

226
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 1>What was the movie that was in,</v>

227
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>there was a movie that was in where the tune,</v>

228
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

229
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:06.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

230
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:07.221
<v Speaker 1>the watch,</v>

231
00:07:07.221 --> 00:07:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Schindler's list terms of Indiana.</v>

232
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.070
<v Speaker 1>You can't even help it.</v>

233
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>You do it right away.</v>

234
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Fucking platoon picture into Oregon's hanging out on the beach.</v>

235
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

236
00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 1>I forget the movie man.</v>

237
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

238
00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>but it was just about,</v>

239
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.750
<v Speaker 1>about a guy who lost everything and in the scene like his,</v>

240
00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:28.910
<v Speaker 1>his wife was like laughing about it when everything was going great.</v>

241
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 1>And then when he did lose all the money,</v>

242
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.620
<v Speaker 1>she did fucking leave them.</v>

243
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Well actually it was in the wolf of Wall Street too.</v>

244
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a common theme and the wolf of Wall Street,</v>

245
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>obviously it was a crazy coked up fucking maniac piece of shit.</v>

246
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.580
<v Speaker 1>But when he was going under and his business was going under,</v>

247
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 1>that's when the wife left him.</v>

248
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.050
<v Speaker 1>When he was doing great.</v>

249
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.630
<v Speaker 1>The wife wanted him when he was married to another woman.</v>

250
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean like it was,</v>

251
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 1>it was a classic story.</v>

252
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:53.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like that's an unfamiliar paradigm to us.</v>

253
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.853
<v Speaker 1>It's nature.</v>

254
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a wounded antelope that gets taken out by the,</v>

255
00:07:56.981 --> 00:07:57.814
<v Speaker 1>the line.</v>

256
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Speaker 1>It's and she needs somebody to provide for her or she doesn't.</v>

257
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 1>But in that role she does,</v>

258
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.030
<v Speaker 1>if she chooses that role,</v>

259
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.120
<v Speaker 1>if she chooses the role of fucking the old wrinkly shaky man with his fucking</v>

260
00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Pale translucent dick that he sticks inside,</v>

261
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.940
<v Speaker 1>we could see as he's coming,</v>

262
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 1>could see the veins like pump whatever blood they've got and it's like a little</v>

263
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:25.610
<v Speaker 1>highway going down his fucking Saran wrap skin filled with Viagara.</v>

264
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

265
00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:28.910
<v Speaker 1>and just shooting dust bubbles into her pussy.</v>

266
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

267
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

268
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's something her nipples,</v>

269
00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>you can take that choice or you know,</v>

270
00:08:34.311 --> 00:08:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you could start an art gallery and become a multimillionaire on your own.</v>

271
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:37.401
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

272
00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>you could do that too.</v>

273
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.270
<v Speaker 1>You know it's,</v>

274
00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.210
<v Speaker 1>but when you are that girl,</v>

275
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.691
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

276
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:46.691
<v Speaker 1>if you are that 25 year old girl than Adderall problem that's looking to try to</v>

277
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 1>hook up with some old billionaire dude and marry him so they'd be taken care of</v>

278
00:08:50.481 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>for life.</v>

279
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.720
<v Speaker 1>You're that.</v>

280
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 1>That's your role.</v>

281
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>That's what you've chosen.</v>

282
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>You might have more potential than that,</v>

283
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean that that's not what you've chosen.</v>

284
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.061
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

285
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:57.751
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know,</v>

286
00:08:57.751 --> 00:08:58.051
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

287
00:08:58.051 --> 00:08:59.010
<v Speaker 1>She's so slick.</v>

288
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>She's so smart.</v>

289
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

290
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 1>that is one of the smartest girls I've ever met in my life.</v>

291
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.820
<v Speaker 1>When she met him and she put together,</v>

292
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:05.983
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

293
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.843
<v Speaker 1>You're talking nonsense.</v>

294
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>She's still that girl.</v>

295
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.720
<v Speaker 1>She's a prostitute.</v>

296
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.481
<v Speaker 1>You can't say no,</v>

297
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:09.541
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

298
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:09.691
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

299
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:09.961
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

300
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 1>you can't say she's a prostitute and I know her and she's powerful.</v>

301
00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:13.610
<v Speaker 1>And what she did was like,</v>

302
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 1>she's really clever and she figured out what admit be like guys.</v>

303
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.870
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

304
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:16.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

305
00:09:16.931 --> 00:09:17.071
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

306
00:09:17.071 --> 00:09:17.904
<v Speaker 1>She's still prostitute.</v>

307
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 1>You're missing the whole point,</v>

308
00:09:18.961 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

309
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.710
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter if she has all this potential.</v>

310
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:22.650
<v Speaker 1>She reads 150 bucks a week.</v>

311
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

312
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.320
<v Speaker 1>don't fucking tell me that girl is so goddamn smart.</v>

313
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

314
00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 1>You're saying she's not smart.</v>

315
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Go see she's a hooker.</v>

316
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 1>She's playing the role of a hooker</v>

317
00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.950
<v Speaker 2>beset in terms of a female and a male,</v>

318
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.980
<v Speaker 2>because sometimes women are so hot that the guy is getting something out of her</v>

319
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.210
<v Speaker 2>and he's putting up with not,</v>

320
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.590
<v Speaker 2>not having love,</v>

321
00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:44.300
<v Speaker 2>not having respect for her,</v>

322
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 2>but wanting that pussy so bad or that status of being with somebody that's that</v>

323
00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:50.360
<v Speaker 2>hot that it is.</v>

324
00:09:50.361 --> 00:09:51.194
<v Speaker 2>Same Way.</v>

325
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.220
<v Speaker 2>He's a prostitute for what he's getting from her.</v>

326
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

327
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.093
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly,</v>

328
00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's exchanges other than money that are unfair.</v>

329
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:02.710
<v Speaker 1>The reason the old man gets the girl in the first place is because of his</v>

330
00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:03.401
<v Speaker 1>fucking money.</v>

331
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:04.150
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

332
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:05.420
<v Speaker 1>So when he's honest vote,</v>

333
00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>people know what they're getting sort of.</v>

334
00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:10.540
<v Speaker 1>But it's not because they're playing a game called love in the game is BB,</v>

335
00:10:10.541 --> 00:10:11.081
<v Speaker 1>I'd love you.</v>

336
00:10:11.081 --> 00:10:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so happy to be with you.</v>

337
00:10:12.341 --> 00:10:12.551
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

338
00:10:12.551 --> 00:10:13.384
<v Speaker 1>you love me.</v>

339
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Do you want some Dick?</v>

340
00:10:14.591 --> 00:10:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I thought your tech baby.</v>

341
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 1>But in the law they're playing a game.</v>

342
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Somebody wins and the show is a winner or loser.</v>

343
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He gets pussy drive,</v>

344
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.051
<v Speaker 1>Pussy.</v>

345
00:10:23.051 --> 00:10:24.220
<v Speaker 1>If she drugs him and surprise.</v>

346
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:24.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

347
00:10:24.641 --> 00:10:26.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter about maintaining that relationship.</v>

348
00:10:26.861 --> 00:10:28.780
<v Speaker 1>And this allowing her to fuck her personal trainer.</v>

349
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

350
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:30.190
<v Speaker 1>He's going to share.</v>

351
00:10:30.191 --> 00:10:30.431
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

352
00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:32.230
<v Speaker 1>She's going to look how hot she is.</v>

353
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.460
<v Speaker 1>She's got this little waste,</v>

354
00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:34.390
<v Speaker 1>this dynamic body.</v>

355
00:10:34.391 --> 00:10:38.100
<v Speaker 1>She's 25 years old and you're 90 she's gonna fuck her trainer.</v>

356
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.190
<v Speaker 1>Just accept it.</v>

357
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Be happy that you could fuck her and don't ask questions.</v>

358
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Hagar is supposed to work out early out,</v>

359
00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:49.240
<v Speaker 1>open dosed with just this smile.</v>

360
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

361
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Ritual,</v>

362
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:51.460
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

363
00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:53.410
<v Speaker 1>She won't have to worry.</v>

364
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:54.610
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking Great Eagle's song,</v>

365
00:10:54.611 --> 00:10:55.444
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

366
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.310
<v Speaker 1>You can't hide your lying eyes man.</v>

367
00:10:57.311 --> 00:10:59.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking jam jam.</v>

368
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.340
<v Speaker 2>Cause when you met your wife,</v>

369
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 2>you were already very successful.</v>

370
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.150
<v Speaker 2>You had money on me.</v>

371
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.193
<v Speaker 2>I had my girl,</v>

372
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.700
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up because I was single when I met my girl,</v>

373
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 2>my now wife,</v>

374
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.641
<v Speaker 2>and it's fucking,</v>

375
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I had an MTV game shell and I was like,</v>

376
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:19.390
<v Speaker 2>I met her at the wrong fucking time,</v>

377
00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:21.440
<v Speaker 1>lined up so much.</v>

378
00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:23.660
<v Speaker 1>But that's not true because you,</v>

379
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.590
<v Speaker 1>you enjoyed it.</v>

380
00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 1>See everybody's worried about what they are,</v>

381
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.470
<v Speaker 1>but you still do.</v>

382
00:11:27.471 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 1>But everybody's worried about what they didn't do.</v>

383
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

384
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.150
<v Speaker 1>This is a no,</v>

385
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I should have done this.</v>

386
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.521
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

387
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:32.354
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't have dry.</v>

388
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.200
<v Speaker 1>I've had people in my life to tell me the most important thing that ever</v>

389
00:11:36.201 --> 00:11:38.210
<v Speaker 1>happened to them was fucking up.</v>

390
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Because if you fuck up,</v>

391
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.030
<v Speaker 1>then you realize you fucked up.</v>

392
00:11:41.031 --> 00:11:43.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's what motivates you to get away from fucking Mcdonald's.</v>

393
00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.960
<v Speaker 1>I should've never done that.</v>

394
00:11:44.961 --> 00:11:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Of course you should have done it.</v>

395
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.421
<v Speaker 1>I lost everything.</v>

396
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:48.800
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up getting that marriage,</v>

397
00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:49.071
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

398
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:50.240
<v Speaker 1>You should have fucking gotten married.</v>

399
00:11:50.241 --> 00:11:51.650
<v Speaker 1>You should have lost everything now.</v>

400
00:11:51.651 --> 00:11:52.484
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 1>you win.</v>

402
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:53.441
<v Speaker 1>Now you,</v>

403
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>when you got the knowledge,</v>

404
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you'll never let it happen again.</v>

405
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>Don't use this as an excuse to just wallow in your own system.</v>

406
00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Then worse than the wallowing fucking divorce guy.</v>

407
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:02.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

408
00:12:02.021 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 2>he's living in a condo and in Marina del Ray and he's fucking go to the same bar</v>

409
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>every night and the same stuff.</v>

410
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys were like,</v>

411
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.800
<v Speaker 2>the woman at Starbucks knows his name because his life has become so simplified</v>

412
00:12:14.201 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 2>and dumbed down because he's afraid to move forward after a divorce.</v>

413
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo used to be a DJ,</v>

414
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.930
<v Speaker 1>a strip club when we first met.</v>

415
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

416
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:22.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

417
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:27.280
<v Speaker 1>Eddie introduced me to the game of how these girls would go about getting men to</v>

418
00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:29.780
<v Speaker 1>buy them things.</v>

419
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd be friends with these girls and knew him through him.</v>

420
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:32.841
<v Speaker 1>So they were like,</v>

421
00:12:32.841 --> 00:12:33.674
<v Speaker 1>they were nice people,</v>

422
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

423
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.250
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't have relationships with them so I was just talking to them and they</v>

424
00:12:37.251 --> 00:12:41.330
<v Speaker 1>would tell me about these guys that they were hooking up with that would buy</v>

425
00:12:41.331 --> 00:12:43.160
<v Speaker 1>them cars and shit and how they would do it.</v>

426
00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:45.480
<v Speaker 1>So I visited him at work and a,</v>

427
00:12:45.481 --> 00:12:45.801
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:47.300
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

430
00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:47.780

433
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.320
<v Speaker 1>You're going to talk to this girl.</v>

434
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.280
<v Speaker 1>And then her,</v>

435
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.270
<v Speaker 1>one of her clients,</v>

436
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:54.260
<v Speaker 1>when she comes in,</v>

437
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:54.921
<v Speaker 1>like you got it.</v>

438
00:12:54.921 --> 00:12:56.930
<v Speaker 1>You got to see like this guy just bought her a truck.</v>

439
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:58.220
<v Speaker 1>He bought her like a Yukon Denali.</v>

440
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:00.330
<v Speaker 1>And so the girls hanging out and you know,</v>

441
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.191
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with your friends.</v>

442
00:13:01.191 --> 00:13:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And this guy comes in who was,</v>

443
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a classic story.</v>

444
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.030
<v Speaker 1>It was a wounded gazelle.</v>

445
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:08.900
<v Speaker 1>55 year old divorce guy works for the post office coming in with his postal</v>

446
00:13:08.901 --> 00:13:09.734
<v Speaker 1>jacket on.</v>

447
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.300
<v Speaker 1>He's norm from cheer.</v>

448
00:13:12.301 --> 00:13:14.620
<v Speaker 1>He bought her a $35,000 car man.</v>

449
00:13:14.621 --> 00:13:15.440
<v Speaker 1>And this guy,</v>

450
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.270
<v Speaker 1>he bought her a fucking Yukon Denali,</v>

451
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:17.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

452
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:18.343
<v Speaker 1>it was a nice car,</v>

453
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe $35,000,</v>

454
00:13:20.151 --> 00:13:20.601
<v Speaker 1>the wrong number.</v>

455
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm just throwing it out there,</v>

456
00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.071
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

457
00:13:22.071 --> 00:13:22.904
<v Speaker 1>He bought her a new car.</v>

458
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:23.521
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

459
00:13:23.521 --> 00:13:23.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

460
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.730
<v Speaker 1>she sees him and she goes,</v>

461
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:26.743
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

462
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And she runs over like little baby steps,</v>

463
00:13:31.121 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 1>like a girl and she's fucking naked man.</v>

464
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:33.491
<v Speaker 1>She's naked.</v>

465
00:13:33.491 --> 00:13:34.211
<v Speaker 1>She's in her underwear.</v>

466
00:13:34.211 --> 00:13:37.000
<v Speaker 1>She got a bikini on and she goes over and gives us guy a hug.</v>

467
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>And you could see this guy is defenseless.</v>

468
00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.680
<v Speaker 1>There's no way in the world that a girl that looks like that would ever have</v>

469
00:13:44.681 --> 00:13:46.120
<v Speaker 1>that kind of reaction to him.</v>

470
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.290
<v Speaker 1>So he's got to pay for that.</v>

471
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.380
<v Speaker 1>You got to pay for that and you got to pay for it by buying her a car or taking</v>

472
00:13:50.381 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 1>care of her fucking credit problem that she's got or you know,</v>

473
00:13:53.561 --> 00:13:54.370
<v Speaker 1>do whatever.</v>

474
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:57.400
<v Speaker 1>You got to figure out how to pay for that shit because there's no other way that</v>

475
00:13:57.401 --> 00:13:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get that relationship.</v>

476
00:13:58.690 --> 00:13:59.740
<v Speaker 1>But when I watched it,</v>

477
00:13:59.741 --> 00:14:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

478
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 1>I looked at Eddie and he was like,</v>

479
00:14:01.631 --> 00:14:02.740
<v Speaker 1>that's shit straight mercenary.</v>

480
00:14:02.741 --> 00:14:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

481
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:03.761
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

482
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

483
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.033
<v Speaker 1>Like they just,</v>

484
00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:08.060
<v Speaker 1>they put a con game on these guys.</v>

485
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 2>I got a friend who's like,</v>

486
00:14:09.791 --> 00:14:12.660
<v Speaker 2>he seems to like make friends with rich people and I,</v>

487
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:14.050
<v Speaker 2>he's a good guy but it's weird.</v>

488
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:15.213
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

489
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 2>he says that a few of these guys,</v>

490
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.560
<v Speaker 2>they really do take care of girls.</v>

491
00:14:20.561 --> 00:14:23.230
<v Speaker 2>They've got like an apartment in New York that she lives in.</v>

492
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 2>She gets a check every month.</v>

493
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:29.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean figure it costs them 50 grand a year and these are guys that have fucking</v>

494
00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.150
<v Speaker 2>$30 million.</v>

495
00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.960
<v Speaker 2>So to have a relationship set up when when they come to town they don't have to</v>

496
00:14:34.961 --> 00:14:38.230
<v Speaker 2>call an escort service and they don't have to go out and try to make a straight</v>

497
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:39.011
<v Speaker 2>relationship with,</v>

498
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.930
<v Speaker 2>they have to send flowers and call every day.</v>

499
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:41.890
<v Speaker 2>They come to town,</v>

500
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.720
<v Speaker 2>she's fucking gorgeous.</v>

501
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:44.530
<v Speaker 2>P You know,</v>

502
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.363
<v Speaker 2>powerful,</v>

503
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:46.293
<v Speaker 2>confident.</v>

504
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:50.780
<v Speaker 2>It's all on the table and they've got like three city set up and it's,</v>

505
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.530
<v Speaker 2>and when,</v>

506
00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 2>when he comes to town,</v>

507
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
<v Speaker 2>she is a available 24 seven whatever the fuck he wants.</v>

508
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.100
<v Speaker 2>And I bet they have some kind of friendship underneath at all.</v>

509
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe not.</v>

510
00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.201
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

511
00:15:02.201 --> 00:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>that would be great if it all worked out like that,</v>

512
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:05.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

513
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:05.810
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

514
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.100
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

515
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.710
<v Speaker 1>if that was the arrangement and it all worked out like that.</v>

516
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

517
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.130
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with people is there's no,</v>

518
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.700
<v Speaker 1>there's never really a static state maintains itself for any long periods of</v>

519
00:15:15.701 --> 00:15:17.200
<v Speaker 1>time when it comes to relationships.</v>

520
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:22.150
<v Speaker 1>You're either kind of all in or you had drift in and out of each other or she</v>

521
00:15:22.151 --> 00:15:23.470
<v Speaker 1>finds another guy.</v>

522
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

523
00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:25.030
<v Speaker 1>people were weird.</v>

524
00:15:25.031 --> 00:15:25.421
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

525
00:15:25.421 --> 00:15:26.620
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to make.</v>

526
00:15:26.621 --> 00:15:30.880
<v Speaker 1>So how are you going to maintain the longterm prostitutional relationships right</v>

527
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.090
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

528
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Not most likely people that begin with,</v>

529
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.541
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

530
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:37.540
<v Speaker 1>most likely mean you're painted out to be awesome and beautiful.</v>

531
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.480
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is that's not what the girl wants.</v>

532
00:15:40.481 --> 00:15:43.060
<v Speaker 1>She wants to find a guy either if she wants someone to take care of her,</v>

533
00:15:43.061 --> 00:15:47.020
<v Speaker 1>she wants to find a guide to take care of her and her lover and her boyfriend or</v>

534
00:15:47.021 --> 00:15:47.920
<v Speaker 1>her husband or whatever.</v>

535
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:51.690
<v Speaker 1>And for this guy that thinks that he's going to like maintain it,</v>

536
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to manage each one of these situations.</v>

537
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.460
<v Speaker 1>If you're some crazy CEO of some giant corporation,</v>

538
00:15:56.470 --> 00:15:59.080
<v Speaker 1>you got like four apartments scattered out across the country with checks living</v>

539
00:15:59.081 --> 00:15:59.490
<v Speaker 1>in them.</v>

540
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.770
<v Speaker 1>You've got to maintain these positions like who's who's fucking her when you're</v>

541
00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:03.221
<v Speaker 1>not there,</v>

542
00:16:03.221 --> 00:16:05.020
<v Speaker 1>what's happening is anybody planning your death,</v>

543
00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:06.490
<v Speaker 1>you better be sure you know,</v>

544
00:16:06.491 --> 00:16:06.611
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

545
00:16:06.611 --> 00:16:07.301
<v Speaker 1>what did you sign?</v>

546
00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:08.380
<v Speaker 1>You sign anything crazy.</v>

547
00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:08.961
<v Speaker 1>You know that.</v>

548
00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Does she have any photographs of your Dick?</v>

549
00:16:10.421 --> 00:16:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Like we'd get for a credit card?</v>

550
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Did you give her a credit card?</v>

551
00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

552
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:15.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like you do,</v>

553
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.320
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to monitor these situations.</v>

554
00:16:17.321 --> 00:16:18.590
<v Speaker 1>This ain't going to be a normal person.</v>

555
00:16:18.591 --> 00:16:20.740
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be a person's willing to fuck you because you pay for them.</v>

556
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

557
00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.120
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

558
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.020
<v Speaker 1>they might be crazy.</v>

559
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

560
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.640
<v Speaker 1>easily might be crazy.</v>

561
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.590
<v Speaker 2>I heard this dude,</v>

562
00:16:25.591 --> 00:16:30.030
<v Speaker 2>I was at the w and a sitting in the lobby waiting and this is dude sitting next</v>

572
00:16:40.951 --> 00:16:42.140
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait to get you out.</v>

573
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.010
<v Speaker 2>You need to stop going to college.</v>

574
00:16:44.011 --> 00:16:44.580
<v Speaker 2>You come in,</v>

575
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.480
<v Speaker 2>I take care of,</v>

576
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.970
<v Speaker 2>he never met her and he was talking on the phone,</v>

577
00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:51.450
<v Speaker 2>clearly met on some kind of high end dating service where you get women that you</v>

578
00:16:51.451 --> 00:16:55.440
<v Speaker 2>take care of that she was flirting back and they were making plans for her to</v>

579
00:16:55.441 --> 00:16:56.610
<v Speaker 2>fly out for a week.</v>

580
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.070
<v Speaker 2>He was going to take her to the best restaurants in La,</v>

581
00:16:59.250 --> 00:16:59.760
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

582
00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.950
<v Speaker 2>And I was telling her all the things he's going to bribe her with.</v>

583
00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:02.341
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

584
00:17:02.341 --> 00:17:04.410
<v Speaker 2>And he had seen pictures online.</v>

585
00:17:04.411 --> 00:17:07.830
<v Speaker 2>They had talked on the phone clearly a few times and he was closing.</v>

586
00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.810
<v Speaker 2>He was making the arrangements to fly her out.</v>

587
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:10.051
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

588
00:17:10.051 --> 00:17:11.100
<v Speaker 2>Why do we have a problem with that?</v>

589
00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Why does anybody have a problem with should been right?</v>

590
00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:15.930
<v Speaker 2>One's eyes are open.</v>

591
00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

592
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I think all prostitution should be legalized.</v>

593
00:17:20.011 --> 00:17:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I think that whorehouses should be legalized.</v>

594
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I think that having having horizontal street or having to go through Craig's</v>

595
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:26.700
<v Speaker 2>list is,</v>

596
00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.140
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible.</v>

597
00:17:28.141 --> 00:17:30.180
<v Speaker 2>The reality is people are going to use Horace,</v>

598
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:31.590
<v Speaker 2>put it on the table,</v>

599
00:17:31.591 --> 00:17:32.424
<v Speaker 2>legalize it,</v>

600
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:35.760
<v Speaker 2>make them get tested for STDs,</v>

601
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.200
<v Speaker 2>make sure they're keeping their money.</v>

602
00:17:37.201 --> 00:17:40.080
<v Speaker 2>They're not getting fucking beaten up and uh,</v>

603
00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.030
<v Speaker 2>and relationships like this should be fine.</v>

604
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

605
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Well unbelievably</v>

606
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:47.750
<v Speaker 1>fascinating that you have something that everybody wants and everybody gets for</v>

607
00:17:47.751 --> 00:17:48.380
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

608
00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.950
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you money to it,</v>

609
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.850
<v Speaker 1>it has this massive stigma to it.</v>

610
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

611
00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:53.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

612
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:56.280
<v Speaker 1>saying that these prostitution and relationships aren't stable,</v>

613
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 1>what relationships are,</v>

614
00:17:59.250 --> 00:17:59.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:00.324
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

616
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.111
<v Speaker 1>you hook up with someone,</v>

617
00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:04.440
<v Speaker 1>is that going to be stable if you just meet people randomly and have sex with</v>

618
00:18:04.441 --> 00:18:04.501
<v Speaker 1>him?</v>

619
00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:05.520
<v Speaker 1>He agreed to have sex with each other.</v>

620
00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:06.301
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to be stable?</v>

621
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 1>You sure it might not be stable either.</v>

622
00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.350
<v Speaker 1>You might run into instability everywhere you turn,</v>

623
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but the main reason why we,</v>

624
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.350
<v Speaker 1>how all these negativity,</v>

625
00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:17.700
<v Speaker 1>negative ideas attached to the idea of prostitution is because it's illegal.</v>

626
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.670
<v Speaker 2>What if you hookup one night with a cheque?</v>

627
00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:20.930
<v Speaker 2>You bought dinner,</v>

628
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.190
<v Speaker 2>you bought drinks,</v>

629
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.150
<v Speaker 2>you paid for the cab,</v>

630
00:18:23.151 --> 00:18:24.050
<v Speaker 2>back to the apartment,</v>

631
00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.340
<v Speaker 2>you spent all the money.</v>

632
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:26.630
<v Speaker 2>You guys fuck.</v>

633
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:29.300
<v Speaker 2>How is that different than how handing the girl money and having sex?</v>

634
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:29.740
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>

635
00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.380
<v Speaker 1>how about all those things are just you dating and there's nothing wrong with</v>

636
00:18:32.381 --> 00:18:35.590
<v Speaker 1>being nice and being nice to someone and taking a friend out or drive in them</v>

637
00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.090
<v Speaker 1>around taking them to a nice restaurant.</v>

638
00:18:37.091 --> 00:18:37.924
<v Speaker 1>Nothing wrong with that.</v>

639
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:39.310
<v Speaker 1>But then what does she says,</v>

640
00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I've got this situation,</v>

641
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

642
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm three months Martin and my rent and I don't know what's doing you like,</v>

643
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.011
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

644
00:18:45.011 --> 00:18:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I'll just take care of it.</v>

645
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And you write her a check and then she sucked your Dick.</v>

646
00:18:48.041 --> 00:18:49.240
<v Speaker 1>What happened there?</v>

647
00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

648
00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.500
<v Speaker 1>What happened there?</v>

649
00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Did you pay for her to Suck Your Dick?</v>

650
00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:52.300
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

651
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:53.110
<v Speaker 1>She might've stopped you dick.</v>

652
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

653
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.490
<v Speaker 1>you might've been like,</v>

654
00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:55.240
<v Speaker 1>listen baby,</v>

655
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.350
<v Speaker 1>you know you don't get money from me,</v>

656
00:18:56.351 --> 00:18:59.590
<v Speaker 1>but you do get Dick and you pull your dick out and then she blows you.</v>

657
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.220
<v Speaker 1>That's different.</v>

658
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

659
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:01.840
<v Speaker 1>But most guys can't pull that off.</v>

660
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:02.703
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

661
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:07.750
<v Speaker 1>what about a marriage where the wife does that work has never earned a dime.</v>

662
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.130
<v Speaker 1>She's having sex with you.</v>

663
00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.150
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that's prostitution according to some people according to some</v>

664
00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:13.391
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

665
00:19:13.391 --> 00:19:14.051
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly is.</v>

666
00:19:14.051 --> 00:19:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean according to a lot of male feminists who would be right,</v>

667
00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:17.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

668
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

669
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

670
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.280
<v Speaker 1>it's money coming in sex going out.</v>

671
00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean if that's what you want to look at,</v>

672
00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's agreements.</v>

673
00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.070
<v Speaker 1>It's the problem is the idea of money.</v>

674
00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:28.840
<v Speaker 1>It's agreements you,</v>

675
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.570
<v Speaker 1>that's where the idea of prostitution sort of,</v>

676
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.930
<v Speaker 1>it comes down to what it comes down to is are people having sex with people that</v>

677
00:19:34.931 --> 00:19:38.680
<v Speaker 1>they might not necessarily have been willing to without any benefit,</v>

678
00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:40.960
<v Speaker 1>but that benefit exists so they are willing to do it.</v>

679
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Is that prostitution?</v>

680
00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:43.241
<v Speaker 1>Because if it,</v>

681
00:19:43.241 --> 00:19:44.770
<v Speaker 1>if that benefit is only money,</v>

682
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:46.130
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>

683
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.590
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

684
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:50.140
<v Speaker 1>you're defining sex for something as sex for money,</v>

685
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.130
<v Speaker 1>that's prostitution.</v>

686
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.570
<v Speaker 1>But everything is sex for something.</v>

687
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

688
00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.230
<v Speaker 2>If you see,</v>

689
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.300
<v Speaker 2>like you were talking about the Ferrari thing before,</v>

690
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.400
<v Speaker 2>if you're at a club and a,</v>

691
00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.660
<v Speaker 2>you see a guy pull up in a Ferrari and you go home with that guy.</v>

692
00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.410
<v Speaker 2>Part of the reason you went home with him is you saw the Ferrari.</v>

693
00:20:05.411 --> 00:20:07.330
<v Speaker 2>There's not dollars exchanged,</v>

694
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:12.510
<v Speaker 2>but there is an implicit understanding this dude's got money and he spends it</v>

695
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.290
<v Speaker 2>like a fucking lunatic.</v>

696
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

697
00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:15.940
<v Speaker 2>and you want to be around that.</v>

698
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.310
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point that he spends it like a fucking lunatic.</v>

699
00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:20.500
<v Speaker 1>That's a great point because that's really what it is.</v>

700
00:20:20.501 --> 00:20:21.600
<v Speaker 1>A guy who's so flashy,</v>

701
00:20:21.601 --> 00:20:23.560
<v Speaker 1>he's driving a $250,000 car.</v>

702
00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.080
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to hesitate to give you a couple of grand here and there,</v>

703
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

704
00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:26.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

705
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:27.880
<v Speaker 1>you want to buy a new pair of shoes.</v>

706
00:20:27.881 --> 00:20:28.211
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

707
00:20:28.211 --> 00:20:28.590
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

708
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't fucking peels off some hundreds,</v>

709
00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:30.860
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

710
00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Gives you a kiss on the cheek and goes back to doing business.</v>

711
00:20:33.191 --> 00:20:33.641
<v Speaker 1>Buy,</v>

712
00:20:33.641 --> 00:20:34.160
<v Speaker 1>sell,</v>

713
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:34.540
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

714
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.840
