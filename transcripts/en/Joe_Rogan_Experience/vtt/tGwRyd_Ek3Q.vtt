1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.520
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.090
Can I just give one interesting UFC memory for me please?

3
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.130
I watched the very first UFC one a with,

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.180
I had a troop at the time and we invited a scout troop.
It wasn't,

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.760
it was a comedy troupe and they have a voice will we dressed as a boy scouts,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.060
but we invited Neil Patrick Harris over.

7
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.800
It was 20 years old at the time he was in town.

8
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.830
We just met him and he came over and soon as the sumo wrestler,
God,

9
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:32.130
his face kicked in and there's spit a tooth out.
I believe.
He was like,

10
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
I'm Outta here.
I gotta get out.
And we made him stay and watch the whole thing.

11
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.920
Good for you.
And that's what made him gay.
While that was,

12
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.450
thanks for ruining the story,
Dave.
I don't know if that's true.
I don't know.

13
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.100
Something happened.
Maybe someone dropped him on his head.
Yeah,

14
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.630
I don't think he knows.
He looked like he was already as a kid.

15
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.040
Something wrong or right.
Depending on if you're his boyfriend.
Yeah.

16
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.160
Imagine it depends if he's a good boyfriend,
right?
Yeah.
Well,
yes,

17
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:05.840
but I mean if the husband,
the husband,
yeah.
The guy's really into him.

18
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.510
Like thank God you watch that fight,
that time.
God thank God.

19
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.650
Otherwise could have never found chick.
Yup.
Who knows.

20
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:15.360
Look at Abby's and shit.
Oh God.

21
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.810
<v 1>And these are places which have levels of violence,</v>

22
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.830
which are like way worse than medieval Europe.
A lot in medieval Europe.

23
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.120
I mean you look at the figures per hundred thousand because some of them have

24
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.250
over a hundred a hundred thousand 150 to a hundred thousand and medieval Europe.

25
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:37.320
A lot of these cities were like 20 per hundred thousand.

26
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.880
So they're way worse that way.

27
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:42.930
Worse than the wild west than like now there are some place in the United
States,

28
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:46.100
the de la I and I did and I've done some research recently in Baltimore Marin

29
00:01:46.101 --> 00:01:47.750
hand and I was kind of,

30
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.500
it's interesting to compare that to Latin America and that's a high level.

31
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.800
That's 4,400 thousands that's not as the same level,

32
00:01:55.801 --> 00:02:00.030
but a significant still more than medieval Europe.
Yeah.
Wow.

33
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.240
Baltimore's worst in medieval Europe.
Yeah.

34
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.590
I'm going to ask the cause you have to have to some professors then they want a,

35
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.470
like you get like,
you know,
they might be,
they might say,

36
00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:11.050
well Jerusalem in this time or in a line,
I know you've got triumph.

37
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.610
When I saw it,

38
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.510
note that it really dig down exactly that there was outbreaks of violence and

39
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:19.020
killing in certain places,
but the overall average of all average year,

40
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.700
that's a significant leap.
100% leap.
Yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah.
Baltimore,

41
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.850
what about South side of Chicago?
It's not that,

42
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.850
I mean like the level I think in Chicago comes out around 20 or something.

43
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:36.860
So it's not now the,
that of the host city.
Now these again,

44
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:40.320
and one of the things about the violence in the United States compared to Latin

45
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:43.130
America,
I mean Baltimore is,
is,
is,

46
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.130
is significant parts of fairly what the city of Baltimore is a fairly small

47
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:49.140
place where they're talking about,

48
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.590
so in Mexico you have entire states that are like really violent or entire

49
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.390
countries in Latin America,

50
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.680
whereas in the U s it tends to be neighborhoods which are violent.
Um,

51
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:00.040
so if you really focus

52
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.890
<v 2>on the south side of Chicago,
I,
it's probably similar levels to Baltimore thing.</v>

53
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.700
[inaudible] um,
but if you look at the whole city,

54
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.400
you've got neighbors that are pretty safe in Chicago's will you?

55
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.430
I grew up with an alcoholic father and it was a pretty violent home and,

56
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.890
and he was a really bad alcoholic.

57
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.690
And I know having grown up in that,

58
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.750
you wind up with what I call a damage,

59
00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:31.751
personal truth and you feel second class and the problem that kids make and uh,

60
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.850
cause I know I did it and I see others do it is you compare your personal truth,

61
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:48.781
what you know about yourself and how you really live and what's really going on.

62
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.690
You compare your personal truth to everybody else's social mask because you go

63
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:56.800
to school and you know,

64
00:03:56.801 --> 00:04:01.330
well I know that last night the windows got kicked out of my house.

65
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.520
I know that the utilities got turned off and I know there was a big fight in my

66
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:09.880
kitchen last night and the kid sitting next to me,

67
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.860
he's got on a shirt that's all ironed and his face is all bright and clean and

68
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:17.530
you know,
he looks like he's just got it all together.

69
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.110
And you compare yourself to that person,

70
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.470
that kid and you feel like you're second class.

71
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.660
And the problem with that is we generate the results in life we think we

72
00:04:28.661 --> 00:04:32.110
deserve.
So if you think your damaged,

73
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.750
do you think your second class you will generate

74
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.310
results that you think a second class person deserves?

75
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.970
So if you don't fix your personal truth,

76
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.370
then you'll spend the rest of your life saying,

77
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:49.210
well you know those really good results,
those belong for somebody else.

78
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.030
That's not for me.
That's for somebody else.

79
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:56.980
And you'll settle for second best and you won't get what you might otherwise

80
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:59.440
generate for yourself if you don't fix your personal truth.

81
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.350
And so I think a lot of people are struggling looking for a way to kind of get

82
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:09.490
out of feeling not good about themselves and damaged self esteem,
damage,

83
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:13.000
self worth.
And they really don't know where to go.
So,
uh,

84
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.730
and that's why I do show,
I don't look,

85
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:18.970
I'm not under the misapprehension that we're doing eight minute cures up there.

86
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:21.400
I mean come on you,
we're not doing it.

87
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.910
But I think if you can point people in the right direction,

88
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:28.840
if you can raise their awareness,
you can get them thinking about it.

89
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:31.870
You can create a narrative where they at least say,
you know,

90
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:36.550
how do I feel about myself?
I mean,
is there stuff I need to resolve?

91
00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:40.000
I mean,
what am I saying to myself?
If you can get them thinking about that,

92
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:41.770
then you know,
maybe you've done something.

93
00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.110
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
Tony Robbins once said once said,</v>

94
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.490
it's incremental changes over the long haul and the way you have to look at it

95
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:50.880
as if these two boats are going in a parallel direction and one of them just

96
00:05:50.881 --> 00:05:53.610
shifts five degrees over the course of time.

97
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.760
This boat is going to be in a far different place than the other boat.

98
00:05:56.761 --> 00:05:58.370
That's in the same way it was always going.

99
00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.551
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:59.551 --> 00:06:04.551
And the important thing to realize as well is the next year is going to go by

101
00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:07.950
whether you're doing something about your life or not.
I mean we're,

102
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:12.951
we're sitting here right now at the end of February and the next 10 months are

103
00:06:15.841 --> 00:06:20.490
going to go by whether somebody is working to make change or whether they're
not.

104
00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.680
And they may think,
you know,
Oh my God,

105
00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:27.300
I'm so far away and I'll never get it under control or I'm so behind in my bills

106
00:06:27.301 --> 00:06:31.820
or I'm so,
uh,
you know,
just depressed or,
uh,
my,

107
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.610
everything is so out of control.
Well,
you know what,

108
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.180
you make those incremental changes and then you know,

109
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.760
pretty soon in December you go,
Hey,

110
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.330
I'm way better off than I was at the end of February.
So Shit,

111
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.250
you made little changes and they all added up.
And if you don't,

112
00:06:50.251 --> 00:06:53.310
by the end of the year,
you're just in deeper.
So every little bit matters.

113
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.411
<v 0>And there's a,</v>

114
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:58.850
it's a seems to be like a universal struggle for figuring out what people are

115
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.150
and how we should behave and who gets to decide that.

116
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.350
And there's certain universal truths are ignored and there's certain ones that

117
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:09.860
our emphasis over emphasized and there's certain ones that are,
you know,

118
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:13.400
that are in the goldilocks spot and we were working it out.

119
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.250
I think that's part of what's going on with human beings,
but will,

120
00:07:16.251 --> 00:07:17.360
we have to be really,

121
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.510
really careful of is that by silencing some people and never giving them any

122
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:28.370
path to retribution,
we create eternal enemies.

123
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.361
And this is,

124
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:32.630
this is what easily could be happening right now when someone doesn't have

125
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.580
ability to express themselves

126
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.590
<v 3>because an evil force wants conflict.</v>

127
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:38.990
And what you say is totally know if it's an evil force,

128
00:07:38.991 --> 00:07:40.960
but it's an archetypal force there.

129
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.610
<v 0>They're listening to all those around them.</v>

130
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.350
And there's a hive hive mind sort of thinking to a lot of this.

131
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:50.560
There's not a lot of debate about,

132
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.340
<v 3>so I like,
let's just say this Joe and,
and to,
um,
10th planet.</v>

133
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:56.174
Everybody else.

134
00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.410
You didn't give into the pressuring of the threat.

135
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.280
It was more than nagging like a siren,
like a bitching woman,
not against women,

136
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.040
but I mean I get it by us and so that's why you didn't have me on,

137
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:14.750
but then you realize I was just a symbol of you just trying to live the life and

138
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:17.300
put out good ideas and talk to people.
But folks,

139
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:20.390
you're going to make you choose a side and that's what's happening in this

140
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.670
quickening is I don't want to choose a side.

141
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.670
<v 0>Ryan Seacrest has got it nailed.</v>

142
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.960
Nobody's coming to Ryan Seacrest for like political advice.
He's got it nailed.

143
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:33.790
He hosts a bunch of shows.
A real nice guys.
Got a great smile.
He figured it out.

144
00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:34.020
But

145
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.170
<v 3>you understand that you are looking at that sweet spot,
man.</v>

146
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:37.960
I looking at you going dummy,

147
00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.660
we are talking about anything and everything.
Oh my God.

148
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.580
Entropy is stagnant water.

149
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.890
Oh it's still nothing's going on.
It's all clear.
It's dead and rotting.

150
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.470
What's alive?
Ocean big crashing.
Yes it's Jersey.

151
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.650
I,
I've seen beyond that.
Everybody has,
but I've,

152
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:05.430
I've seen way beyond cause you want to be in the conflict,

153
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.060
you want to be in the fight,
you want to take all your,

154
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.970
you're not successful Joe.
Cause you played along with the system.

155
00:09:11.971 --> 00:09:14.820
You're successful because you did it organically and real doesn't mean it's

156
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:17.220
perfect.
Doesn't mean it's bad.
It was real.

157
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.740
That's why your success and then they come in and you think,

158
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:21.780
oh I'm not saying you're bad.
I'm the same way.

159
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.890
Oh all these people are telling me how great I am.

160
00:09:23.891 --> 00:09:26.940
I play ball with them because I've got,
you know this thing.

161
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.340
But they want you because they're soulless.

162
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.990
And so all I'm saying is you've made the right decision and I don't,

163
00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:37.260
I'm just saying having beyond because I'm not perfect is deciding no,
America,

164
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.910
sill America,
the world,
still the world.

165
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.030
We're allowed to talk about real things and here real things because they want

166
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:45.790
to shut other voices down so they can lie about those voices.
And,

167
00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:50.580
and any idea that fears,
exposure or fears,
debate is a failed idea.

168
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.510
<v 4>When you guys wrote songs,</v>

169
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.220
<v 3>how did you,
how did you put the lyrics to the music?
What was the process like?</v>

170
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:02.880
How did you guys sort that out?
So you,
would you come to them with an idea?

171
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.030
Would they come to you with a riff?
Like how,
how would,
how would it work?

172
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.830
<v 4>It'll work,
uh,
a number of ways.</v>

173
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.860
But a mistake that a lot of young writers in my department,

174
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:20.360
the lyrics make is that they think of it as secondary.
Mm.

175
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:25.910
They wait for the music or the track first and then you'll walk into a studio

176
00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:34.220
and hope that the hand of God will descend and grace you with a amazing

177
00:10:36.181 --> 00:10:40.560
epiphany's.
I can't even spell amazing.
All right.

178
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.290
Um,
and called upon to do it right away.
You know,

179
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:49.200
you'll work out a beat and go,
Dave,
you got some lyrics.

180
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.620
If I go walk into that room and try to create it right there,

181
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.600
nine times out of 10,
it's going to be moving in June,
right?
Moon and June.

182
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.270
Really when?
Sometime soon.
What time of day?

183
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.330
I'm thinking noon and literally I'm gonna put my hands in the air.

184
00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:11.430
Why?
Well,
cause I just don't care.

185
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.520
You wind up there unless you're banking.

186
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.110
Think like debate.
If you're going to debate somebody,

187
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.460
you're banking your ideas,
right?
Alright.

188
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.720
And whatever the subject is,
you can go,

189
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.430
you don't even have to have a subject itch.
Okay.
I like what he just said.

190
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.360
I might even write that phrase.
I like what you just said.

191
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:50.020
Could be a Drake lyric.
Any expressions,
ideas,

192
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.140
slogans,
uh,
anything that comes,

193
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.940
other tunes in terms of their lyric.
And is everybody contributing?
No,

194
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:02.620
that's just me.
Just to have volumes of that and those kinds of ideas,

195
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.530
ideas for songs,
storylines,
et Cetera.
Um,

196
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.340
you would never go into a fight without doing that.

197
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:15.510
Collecting moves from every other film of every other fighter that you possibly

198
00:12:16.211 --> 00:12:19.810
can,
so that when somebody goes like this,
you go,
oh,
I know what to do.

199
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.690
So on and so forth.
And then I'm going to visit like this.

200
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.200
And somebody says it's a song about they play a song.
I go,
wow,

201
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:27.940
it sounds kinda like cowboy music.

202
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:32.410
Let's write about cowboys going through the banking.

203
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.810
Giddyup
that's cool.
Title.

204
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:40.930
I heard a cowboy,

205
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:45.250
I say it on the TV set and I wrote it down literally.

206
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.600
Okay.
And you start bay,
you get,

207
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:52.900
I see the lights come and you start banking.
