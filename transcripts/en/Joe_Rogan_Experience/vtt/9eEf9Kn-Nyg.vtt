<v Speaker 1>Drive by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.630
<v Speaker 1>But you have a responsibility of greatness.</v>

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.970
<v Speaker 1>There's this very few people that ever get to the position that you,</v>

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>

5
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.610
<v Speaker 1>we're in when you won the title,</v>

6
00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>when you were the youngest ever UFC heavyweight where light heavyweight</v>

7
00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:18.844
<v Speaker 1>champion,</v>

8
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.923
<v Speaker 1>not just that,</v>

9
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 1>the youngest ever UFC champion.</v>

10
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

11
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>not just that there's that,</v>

12
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 1>there's also responsibility that comes with potential.</v>

13
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

14
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not just what,</v>

15
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>what you've done and you know,</v>

16
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>it's what you could've done.</v>

17
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

18
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.310
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

19
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.730
<v Speaker 1>you fought Alexander Gustafson.</v>

20
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Be honest about that.</v>

21
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 1>How much did you train for that fight?</v>

22
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.913
<v Speaker 2>I trained,</v>

23
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 2>I trained for the fight,</v>

24
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

25
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.171
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

26
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.453
<v Speaker 2>I definitely,</v>

28
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 2>I had this thing where I just felt invincible and,</v>

29
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 2>did a lot of wild stuff leading up to the fight.</v>

31
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 2>I definitely didn't give it my all</v>

32
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 1>as far as partying and sleeping.</v>

33
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.873
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

34
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Stay up all night.</v>

35
00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

38
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>when you win a fight like that where you weren't 100%,</v>

39
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>does that sort of almost reinforced this idea that you could do anything you</v>

40
00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:09.311
<v Speaker 1>want?</v>

41
00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:09.821
<v Speaker 1>And then man,</v>

42
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>imagine if I trained next time,</v>

43
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:12.281
<v Speaker 1>if it's someone big,</v>

44
00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>I'll train.</v>

45
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.641
<v Speaker 2>So I have this,</v>

47
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to share something with,</v>

48
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if I've ever shared this with anyone else before,</v>

49
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 2>but I had this crazy thing that I would do,</v>

50
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.323
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 2>where I would party one week before every fight.</v>

52
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 2>And I did it throughout my whole career.</v>

53
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.473
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

54
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>and this was stupid,</v>

55
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 2>but it was this mental crutch that I had.</v>

56
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 2>I literally would one week before every flight I would go out and I will get</v>

57
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:37.164
<v Speaker 2>blacked out wasted.</v>

58
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 2>And my logic was if this guy were to beat me somehow,</v>

59
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

60
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

61
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I can look myself in the mirror and say that,</v>

62
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

63
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 2>I lost because I got hammered the week before the fight.</v>

64
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

65
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 2>so it was a built in safety net.</v>

66
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 2>It was a safety net.</v>

67
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

68
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.354
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

69
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 2>So I did it my whole career.</v>

70
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:01.050
<v Speaker 2>I would go out and get hammered when we,</v>

71
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 2>before every fight.</v>

72
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever worked with a sports psychologist?</v>

73
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

74
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 2>but now,</v>

75
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.723
<v Speaker 2>but now I don't.</v>

76
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.463
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

77
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 2>my open st proof.</v>

78
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I was the first fight that I did not do that.</v>

79
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.800
<v Speaker 2>It was my</v>

80
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 1>worst for apartments.</v>

81
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it was your worst performance.</v>

82
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I think you were very unjustly criticized for that fight.</v>

83
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think over in St Pru is a very tough guy.</v>

84
00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>He's a very difficult fired.</v>

85
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>He's very strong.</v>

86
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.290
<v Speaker 1>He's got a brutal left kick.</v>

87
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.341
<v Speaker 1>He's athletic,</v>

88
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:28.240
<v Speaker 1>he moves well.</v>

89
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was a good performance,</v>

90
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but it was my worst performance.</v>

91
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>See I think OVN St proves of really tough guy and he was a tough fight.</v>

92
00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>And you hadn't fought in a long time.</v>

93
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.620
<v Speaker 1>You were off for how long?</v>

94
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:39.161
<v Speaker 1>How many months?</v>

95
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 1>16 months or something,</v>

96
00:02:40.151 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

97
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

98
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 2>it was done.</v>

99
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.273
<v Speaker 2>It was over a year.</v>

100
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

101
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.593
<v Speaker 2>it was a long time.</v>

102
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.553
<v Speaker 2>Over a year.</v>

103
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.240
<v Speaker 1>You're fighting a guy who had been pretty active and fought some good guys,</v>

104
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 1>had a great victory of a Shogun and looked real good and a lot of his fights.</v>

105
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>And was an up and comer</v>

106
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 2>main thing about events that really bothered me.</v>

107
00:02:55.901 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 2>It was um,</v>

108
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

109
00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 2>he was the most,</v>

110
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

111
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.971
<v Speaker 2>well he was seizing.</v>

112
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:01.121
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

113
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 2>actually it has been fighting longer than I have.</v>

114
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't realize that,</v>

115
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 2>but he was just so,</v>

116
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.053
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

117
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 2>green and raw still like a skill wise,</v>

118
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:10.421
<v Speaker 2>skill wise.</v>

119
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:10.951
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

120
00:03:10.951 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

121
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.333
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

122
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I study everybody extensively and then I come up with their patterns.</v>

123
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.381
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

124
00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 2>I've figured out the way they flinch.</v>

125
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 2>I figured out their first favorite punch,</v>

126
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.380
<v Speaker 2>their second favorite punch,</v>

127
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>that third,</v>

128
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 2>their favorite combinations,</v>

129
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.071
<v Speaker 2>the way they're set up.</v>

130
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:25.610
<v Speaker 2>So they take downs when they clinch.</v>

131
00:03:25.611 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 2>What side of the head is going to be literally everything.</v>

132
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 2>I know everything about every opponent,</v>

133
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 2>what side they're going to shoot,</v>

134
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.230
<v Speaker 2>whether it's going to be a head inside his head outside.</v>

135
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>What am I going to do about that?</v>

136
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.233
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

137
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I figured out everything,</v>

138
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:35.941
<v Speaker 2>why they shoot,</v>

139
00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:36.141
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

140
00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 2>what area of the cage they like to shoot everything.</v>

141
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

142
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

143
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 2>with all the same proof.</v>

144
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.341
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

145
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:42.641
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

146
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.001
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

147
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't know what he's going to do.</v>

148
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 2>He's so,</v>

149
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.653
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

150
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.261
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

151
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 2>Orthodox and Orthodox,</v>

152
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

153
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

154
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 2>he gets these random knock offs from these weird angles and he's just wing stuff</v>

155
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 2>and he almost closes his eyes and next thing you know,</v>

156
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 2>he's knocked somebody out,</v>

157
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

158
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 2>So the scary thing about him was he's so unpredictable,</v>

159
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

161
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>and I had a lot on the line.</v>

162
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.671
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

163
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:04.421
<v Speaker 2>so I just said,</v>

164
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.254
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

165
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 2>this guy is a,</v>

166
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 2>he's in a shell pretty much the whole fight.</v>

167
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 2>He was defensive the whole site and a,</v>

168
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 2>and I just thought I close through the fight,</v>

169
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

170
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 2>and not really risk anything,</v>

171
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 2>which I felt like I let myself down because I'm normally,</v>

172
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.383
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>

173
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean normally when you get someone like that,</v>

174
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:21.960
<v Speaker 2>you just,</v>

175
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.253
<v Speaker 2>take them out.</v>

177
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

178
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.431
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

179
00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 2>I should have just been able to take them out.</v>

180
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 2>But I was content with a winning and I think that was,</v>

181
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 2>I think that was one of the first fights where I actually just wanted to get the</v>

182
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 2>win,</v>

183
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.743
<v Speaker 2>get my money,</v>

184
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>go back to,</v>

185
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

186
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>what are my actual goal,</v>

187
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 2>which was DC.</v>

188
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

189
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.010
<v Speaker 2>instead of,</v>

190
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>wanting to finish this guy like normal.</v>

192
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 2>So I had to really question my,</v>

193
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

194
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I really questioned myself and why,</v>

195
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.923
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

196
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 2>why I was like that,</v>

197
00:04:48.791 --> 00:04:50.340
<v Speaker 2>why I was consulting with closely.</v>

198
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
