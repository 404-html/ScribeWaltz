1
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.053
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Before we even started the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rest in peace.</v>

3
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>died yesterday.</v>

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.393
<v Speaker 2>One of the coolest guys ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite people that ever got </v>

6
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:17.214
<v Speaker 2>on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first and only full gas that I've </v>

7
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:21.174
<v Speaker 2>ever done skype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only reason why I did it on </v>

8
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 2>Skype,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's cause he wasn't feeling well and he</v>

9
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 2>couldn't fly to California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.613
<v Speaker 2>this guy is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I generally like to have conversations </v>

11
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:31.284
<v Speaker 2>with people when they're in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they go more friendly and </v>

12
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:34.434
<v Speaker 2>they're smoother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way you can work through any bumps </v>

13
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 2>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way he feel better.</v>

14
00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 2>It feels like it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 2>but he was so important to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have fucking taken,</v>

16
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a raven note.</v>

17
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>

18
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 2>if you'd never seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 2>the DVD series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>magical Egypt,</v>

20
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 2>it's truly an amazing piece of work.</v>

21
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.921
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

22
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:56.754
<v Speaker 2>I think six dvds all about the history </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Egypt and the immense complexity of </v>

23
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:05.874
<v Speaker 2>the structures that are built there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The appreciation this guy had for what </v>

24
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptians did was just off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>charts.</v>

25
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:15.801
<v Speaker 2>He was just so deeply engaged with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was such a giant part of his life and</v>

26
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 2>the passion and the curiosity that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>had in the knowledge that he had.</v>

27
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 2>And these dvds would come through and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you would just be like holding your face</v>

28
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.214
<v Speaker 2>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going,</v>

29
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 2>all my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are amazing.</v>

30
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.463
<v Speaker 2>Just what a crazy time in human history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this weird blip in the middle of North </v>

31
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Africa where these people just went past</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody else just way past.</v>

32
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.010
<v Speaker 2>And they did it for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

33
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 2>They did it in this one spot for who </v>
<v Speaker 2>knows how long.</v>

34
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 2>That's where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thousands and thousands of years.</v>

35
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>And Graham Hancock and John Anthony West</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the people that are really,</v>

36
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the front of the line in terms of the</v>

37
00:02:04.801 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 2>public eye of pushing the timeline back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's real evidence for it.</v>

38
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.171
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

39
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hancock's getting super vindicated or,</v>

40
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is.</v>

41
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

42
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West had vindicated as well</v>
<v Speaker 2>by um,</v>

43
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Robert Schoch,</v>

44
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 2>who's a geologist from Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>University.</v>

45
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.713
<v Speaker 2>He went to Egypt and he studied the </v>
<v Speaker 2>enclosure that the Sphinx was in and </v>

46
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.133
<v Speaker 2>he's the guy that determined that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were looking at fishers that were </v>

47
00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 2>created by thousands of years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>rainfall,</v>

48
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 2>which would push back because what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know about the,</v>

49
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 2>the what the climate was like in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>area.</v>

50
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 2>Apparently it pushes it back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around 9,000</v>

51
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is crazy.</v>

52
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause look however old it was,</v>

53
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 2>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pyramids are a real thing.</v>

54
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.343
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean everybody gets real weird about </v>

55
00:02:47.761 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 2>pushing the date back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when it happened.</v>

56
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 2>There's no way it happened 30,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

57
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 2>It definitely happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>2,500</v>

58
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 2>BC maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe,</v>

59
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 2>but it'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it did,</v>

60
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 2>let's just say it all was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just came out of nowhere.</v>

61
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 3>Some are around that Arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a crazy spot,</v>

62
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean forget about the,</v>

63
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.630
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

64
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.463
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the confusion and the conflict around </v>

65
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 3>the timeline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just what it is.</v>

66
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.843
<v Speaker 3>Those people were on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the main reason people get so </v>

67
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 3>pissed off at Hancock and West for </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to push the timeline back?</v>

68
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 3>Because they'd been teaching one </v>
<v Speaker 3>timeline for a long time.</v>

69
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to admit they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

70
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.440
<v Speaker 3>If somebody publishes a book about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>timeline and just say definitively says,</v>

71
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 3>we know now that Egypt was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

72
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.073
<v Speaker 3>hunter gatherer culture that somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>around 3000 BC erupted into this </v>

73
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:44.640
<v Speaker 3>incredible civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

74
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 3>They just been teaching that for so </v>
<v Speaker 3>long.</v>

75
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.861
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there've been teaching,</v>

76
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that version of it,</v>

77
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 3>but there were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their version is more accurate than what</v>

78
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 3>I just said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll just making up numbers.</v>

79
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:54.364
<v Speaker 3>But the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they've been teaching is probably </v>

80
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:57.210
<v Speaker 3>not right.</v>

81
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.280
<v Speaker 3>And if they wrote books about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've t taught classes about it.</v>

82
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 3>All these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ego.</v>

83
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.094
<v Speaker 3>It's just the ego of scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is 100% some ego involved because </v>

84
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.134
<v Speaker 3>there was a conversation that John </v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony West and doctor Robert Schoch </v>

85
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 3>had with an egyptologist and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Egyptologist.</v>

86
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 3>This is on a television show that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually on TV.</v>

87
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 3>It was on like NBC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was called the mystery.</v>

88
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:21.064
<v Speaker 3>That's finks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was actually narrated by Charlton </v>

89
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 3>Heston and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

90
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:25.804
<v Speaker 3>it was all about John Anthony West work </v>
<v Speaker 3>and about Graham Hancock's work and </v>

91
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Robert shocks work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

92
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.183
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they brought this geological </v>

93
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 3>evidence to these egyptologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were openly mocking it,</v>

94
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.723
<v Speaker 3>like laughing in this weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What evidence is there for this </v>

95
00:04:43.721 --> 00:04:44.554
<v Speaker 3>civilization back then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much evidence do you think </v>

96
00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:47.764
<v Speaker 3>would be there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to realize how long ago </v>

97
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's talking about maybe 10,000,</v>

98
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:56.080
<v Speaker 3>500 BC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe earlier.</v>

99
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 3>They think it might have all started </v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere around 30,000</v>

100
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just fucking bananas.</v>

101
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.471
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there it is.</v>

102
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.304
<v Speaker 3>Mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This famous powerful Jamie finds it </v>

103
00:05:05.261 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 3>online are they are John Anthony West </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he,</v>

104
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:09.604
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>litter literally dedicated his life to </v>

105
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.384
<v Speaker 3>absorbing as much information as </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible about the nature of the </v>

106
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 3>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time periods,</v>

107
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.050
<v Speaker 3>the hieroglyphs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

108
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.913
<v Speaker 3>it's just an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing body of work that that guy put </v>

109
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:28.421
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Powerful.</v>

110
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Charlton Heston look eager that I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>answer.</v>

111
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 3>I would hang out with him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care.</v>

112
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 3>Even if he was wacky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wanted to talk about guns all day.</v>

113
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.844
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on Charles and hang out with </v>

114
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Charlton Heston was going to turn down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charles,</v>

115
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.283
<v Speaker 3>do you remember when Charleston has </v>
<v Speaker 3>another gun on TV and it was like </v>

116
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:50.131
<v Speaker 3>they'll take my rifle away when they pry</v>
<v Speaker 3>my cold dead hands off of it.</v>

117
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 3>Did he hold up a rifle when he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

118
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 3>I imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

119
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I think he probably did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I so not.</v>

120
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.393
<v Speaker 3>Why not?</v>

121
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.263
<v Speaker 4>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why not hold up your fucking massive </v>

122
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 4>symbol for your cock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your Harry Potter?</v>

123
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 4>He said it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>

124
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:08.210
<v Speaker 4>It's just as I imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He will never take my cock for me.</v>

125
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.073
<v Speaker 4>It's even better because it's a musket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why not just hold up a rock just like </v>

126
00:06:12.011 --> 00:06:16.600
<v Speaker 4>got rock any rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>huh?</v>

127
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People get fucking really passionate </v>

128
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guns circumcision.</v>

129
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.573
<v Speaker 4>I am.</v>

130
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.443
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am all for responsible people being </v>

131
00:06:28.901 --> 00:06:29.734
<v Speaker 3>able to own guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm also completely in agreement </v>

132
00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:34.624
<v Speaker 3>with people that say that there's too </v>
<v Speaker 3>many people out there committing crimes </v>

133
00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:39.430
<v Speaker 3>with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how do you,</v>

134
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Speaker 3>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you clean all that up?</v>

135
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.490
<v Speaker 3>I do not know.</v>

136
00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's worth thinking about.</v>

137
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.110
<v Speaker 4>It is worth thinking about and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>worth talking about.</v>

138
00:06:46.111 --> 00:06:49.800
<v Speaker 4>And people get upset when you start </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about it because they want it to</v>

139
00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:52.980
<v Speaker 4>be just know we have a right to have any</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of gun that we want,</v>

140
00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:54.840
<v Speaker 4>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they're missing.</v>

141
00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the real big problems,</v>

142
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.960
<v Speaker 4>which were just weirdly seeing the very </v>
<v Speaker 4>beginning of it,</v>

143
00:07:00.961 --> 00:07:02.700
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this ties in,</v>

144
00:07:02.701 --> 00:07:03.534
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Elon Musk just blasted the fucking </v>

145
00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 4>car and his face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He blessed the Tesla,</v>

146
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.123
<v Speaker 4>the space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a tesla floating around the </v>

147
00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:11.050
<v Speaker 4>planet now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like the,</v>

148
00:07:11.051 --> 00:07:13.860
<v Speaker 4>the way that connects with guns is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

149
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:15.383
<v Speaker 4>this is an example of technology falling</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the hands of like a private </v>

150
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.820
<v Speaker 4>company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This isn't the government.</v>

151
00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:25.590
<v Speaker 4>This is like Ilan fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I go to burning man musk,</v>

152
00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:31.030

<v Speaker 4>shot a fucking tesla into space,</v>

153
00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:32.154
<v Speaker 4>which is now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess going to rotate around the </v>

154
00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:34.074
<v Speaker 4>planet for some certain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how long it's going to be </v>

155
00:07:35.401 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 4>up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

156
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.190
<v Speaker 4>I think it's going to Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

157
00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:41.520
<v Speaker 4>that fucking thing is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put it in orbit around Mars.</v>

158
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.560
<v Speaker 4>It's going past Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

00:07:43.561 --> 00:07:45.930
<v Speaker 4>you fucked up he lawn.</v>

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.070
<v Speaker 4>You fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fucked up.</v>

162
00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:53.933
<v Speaker 4>Ilan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could have done better dumb dumb </v>

163
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 4>with your rockets that can land and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shooting a gun in his face.</v>

164
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

165
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.220
<v Speaker 4>That is what happened.</v>

166
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.053
<v Speaker 3>It's when you take it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government's hands and put it in a </v>

167
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:03.134
<v Speaker 3>geniuses hands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's got a very unique ability to </v>

168
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:06.230
<v Speaker 3>get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

169
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 3>That boring project that he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>under La flame throwers,</v>

170

<v Speaker 3>look guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can fix this traffic thing.</v>

176
00:08:23.271 --> 00:08:24.104
<v Speaker 3>What I'm going to do is I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>drill holes underneath the ground and </v>

177
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put your car on a high </v>
<v Speaker 3>speed sled and</v>

178
00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 4>you don't even drive this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

179
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:32.930
<v Speaker 4>okay guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

180
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been,</v>

181
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.280
<v Speaker 4>you remember the old like how it used to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be at the banks with the suction tubes.</v>

182
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.173
<v Speaker 4>Where are you taking a tube and you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your mom puts the check in and it gets </v>

183
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:41.714
<v Speaker 4>sucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do that with fucking buses </v>

184
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.520
<v Speaker 4>under the city.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think?</v>

185
00:08:46.521 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 4>Write the check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to let you do it.</v>

186
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:54.850
<v Speaker 4>But the thing where it connects to guns </v>
<v Speaker 4>is it's like we're looking at the very,</v>

187
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very beginning of of private individuals</v>

188
00:08:59.070 --> 00:08:59.903
<v Speaker 4>having access to technology that </v>
<v Speaker 4>normally it was in the hands of the </v>

189
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:03.384
<v Speaker 4>state governments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is the very crazy beginning of </v>

190
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:07.260
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know he was shooting at,</v>

191
00:09:07.261 --> 00:09:08.094
<v Speaker 4>at Mars for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought that fucking thing was going </v>

192
00:09:10.011 --> 00:09:10.844
<v Speaker 4>to like rotate around the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which made me worry that like we're </v>

193
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:14.724
<v Speaker 4>going to end up with like a ring of </v>
<v Speaker 4>billionaire car cause he'll be like the </v>

194
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:21.410
<v Speaker 4>coolest thing for billionaires to do.</v>

195
00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.673
<v Speaker 4>Shoot your car up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's also a great way to dispose a </v>

196
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 4>body's cause.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's that astronaut in there and</v>

197
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:29.034
<v Speaker 4>I keep thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet that's one of the Elon Musk's </v>

198
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.213
<v Speaker 4>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet he that could be a body in there </v>

199
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:35.963
<v Speaker 4>and no one would ever fucking magic of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it is just some asshole who robbed Elan </v>

200
00:09:40.741 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Musk in a business deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

201
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 4>just shot the guy and have one of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>flunky stuff.</v>

202
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm into a car you never fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just disappeared.</v>

203
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:51.220
<v Speaker 4>He just disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can be fucking anybody man.</v>

204
00:09:51.221 --> 00:09:52.054
<v Speaker 4>Control to major Tom and then also </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's really bad as about this is the </v>

205
00:09:56.011 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 4>flat earthers are now like really having</v>
<v Speaker 4>problems because of the,</v>

206
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:02.700
<v Speaker 4>somebody sent me a video today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>show me that it's fake.</v>

207
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 4>The building on twitter so many that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fake.</v>

208
00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:07.190
<v Speaker 4>It's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brown was frank bro.</v>

209
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's fake up like what's the thing?</v>

210
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:10.770
<v Speaker 4>The moon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the sky.</v>

211
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 4>The God of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mom is flat,</v>

212
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:14.891
<v Speaker 4>fake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fake,</v>

213
00:10:14.891 --> 00:10:15.724
<v Speaker 4>fake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fake.</v>

214
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:18.653
<v Speaker 4>Your mom's flat as fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mom's flouted in the plant earth </v>

215
00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the earth's flat.</v>

216
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 4>But is it this like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

217
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.063
<v Speaker 4>what's crazy about the John Anthony West</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff and the Graham Hancock stuff is </v>

218
00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:33.671
<v Speaker 4>like in the way that flat earth and </v>
<v Speaker 4>delusional insane way sort of forces you</v>

219
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:34.794
<v Speaker 4>to imagine yourself existing in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe that's completely different </v>

220
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:38.544
<v Speaker 4>than what you thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that's why it's really </v>

221
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 4>appealing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's an appealing cool,</v>

222
00:10:42.361 --> 00:10:44.910
<v Speaker 4>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hilarious mythology was just like,</v>

223
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:46.620
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how cool would that be if we really were</v>

224
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:47.454
<v Speaker 4>on a flat earth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like if I just keep going in one </v>

225
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 4>direction and hit the ice wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit the ice well,</v>

226
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:54.470
<v Speaker 4>but over the fucking ice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well now we're in the land of the grays,</v>

227
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm no longer trapped.</v>

228
00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a freeing feeling because like,</v>

229
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:00.443
<v Speaker 4>even though it's not like I travel </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to feel stuck in fucking </v>

230
00:11:03.721 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is an insane thing,</v>

231
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 4>there's a little piece of us that knows </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're never going to go into space.</v>

232
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 4>We're never going to get past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're never going to,</v>

233
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.980
<v Speaker 4>how do you get off the map?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

234
00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:14.814
<v Speaker 4>Like there's something in a human that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to get off the fucking map where </v>

235
00:11:17.251 --> 00:11:18.084
<v Speaker 4>you end up in a place that hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 4>charted yet and that's an experience </v>

236
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:21.804
<v Speaker 4>that's gone basically like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I imagine swaths of the Amazon </v>

237
00:11:24.691 --> 00:11:25.524
<v Speaker 4>perhaps or like some place deep deep in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Arctic may be in a cave or </v>

238
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:29.754
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it used to be people just didn't </v>

239
00:11:31.051 --> 00:11:34.760
<v Speaker 4>fucking know you could go off the map </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you had no idea.</v>

240
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.633
<v Speaker 4>I think that must have been the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 4>rush to be on a ship and looking at the </v>

241
00:11:39.481 --> 00:11:42.390
<v Speaker 4>maps that you guys have and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck dude,</v>

242
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.570
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't know where we're at here man.</v>

243
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 4>Like this is unknown uncharted terrain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So flat earth is a really,</v>

244
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe the earth is flat.</v>

245
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.770
<v Speaker 4>I it's more like a triangle shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the other guy,</v>

246
00:11:55.771 --> 00:11:56.604
<v Speaker 4>it's a big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a giant cosmic dick at that would </v>

247
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:00.184
<v Speaker 4>be looking at the head of the Dick and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they just don't want us to know that </v>

248
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:03.244
<v Speaker 4>cause it's kind of embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking earth looks like a big spinning </v>

249
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 4>Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all CGI,</v>

250
00:12:09.371 --> 00:12:11.320
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shaped like a dick.</v>

251
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.760
<v Speaker 4>It's just a big blue and white fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dick Green.</v>

252
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do people want that?</v>

253
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.840
<v Speaker 4>We want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we always want things to be weird,</v>

254
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.823
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want,</v>

255
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:21.873
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the flat earth one is my favorite one </v>

256
00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 4>because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what could you imagine if their rights q</v>

257
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 4>magic they were writing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I if the whole plant,</v>

258
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:29.944
<v Speaker 4>I thought the world was round and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all this information that shows </v>

259
00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:32.884
<v Speaker 4>the world is round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For thousands of years ago people were </v>

260
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:35.074
<v Speaker 4>doing calculations are sticking sticks </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the ground in equal distance and </v>

261
00:12:38.381 --> 00:12:39.214
<v Speaker 4>measuring them and trying to see if </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's curvature and the this Zoe's </v>

262
00:12:43.081 --> 00:12:43.914
<v Speaker 4>been people that suspected the earth was</v>
<v Speaker 4>round way before they could ever figure </v>

263
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 4>it out.</v>

264
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.580
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look well the moon is round,</v>

265
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.860
<v Speaker 4>the sun is round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is around.</v>

266
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably this was round.</v>

267
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how much she would kind of think,</v>

268
00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:55.864
<v Speaker 4>well how big is this fucking thing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if you get up high enough you </v>

269
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:00.820
<v Speaker 4>can kind of see like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's this really big,</v>

270
00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.830
<v Speaker 4>I see like a very slight curvature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can,</v>

271
00:13:03.831 --> 00:13:05.860
<v Speaker 4>maybe I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Am I always on my mind?</v>

272
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:06.870
<v Speaker 4>Fucking myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

273
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.223
<v Speaker 4>And you could just sat around and mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked yourself into thinking that it </v>

274
00:13:11.051 --> 00:13:12.970
<v Speaker 4>was all a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

275
00:13:12.971 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 4>And that the world is actually flat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then gravity isn't real either.</v>

276
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:19.060
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

277
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.970
<v Speaker 4>Except but guy on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's exciting.</v>

278
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.250
<v Speaker 4>It's magnets that pull people into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>earth.</v>

279
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 4>Your life gets so exciting at that </v>
<v Speaker 4>point.</v>

280
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh yes.</v>

<v Speaker 4>getting out there.</v>

283
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 4>Cause the Nass holes are going to take </v>
<v Speaker 4>you out.</v>

284
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:36.880

285
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 4>Clinton Foundation finds out about your </v>
<v Speaker 4>theories.</v>

286
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.230
<v Speaker 4>The earth being flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fuck,</v>

00:13:41.231 --> 00:13:42.340
<v Speaker 4>come get you.</v>

00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:43.174
<v Speaker 4>So now you're living,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you get to live in maybe a not very </v>

289
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.963
<v Speaker 4>happy world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but an exciting world because you're </v>

290
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 4>seeing vans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing fucking like create.</v>

291
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:52.600
<v Speaker 4>Now this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

292
00:13:52.601 --> 00:13:56.620
<v Speaker 4>this is not say that there isn't some </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive,</v>

293
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.633
<v Speaker 4>huge unknown swath of reality that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting right in front of us at all </v>

294
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:04.060
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actively being hidden by the United</v>

295
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.893
<v Speaker 4>States government in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That the technology that they finally </v>

296
00:14:06.821 --> 00:14:07.654
<v Speaker 4>detected the thing and they don't want </v>
<v Speaker 4>us to know because they know if we know </v>

297
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 4>who the fuck knows what the reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't want us to know just yet.</v>

298
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.583
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying with flat earth in </v>

299
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:17.620
<v Speaker 4>particular.</v>

300
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.180
<v Speaker 4>Freaking me the fuck out man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you know?</v>

301
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.100
<v Speaker 4>What do I know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you know man?</v>

302
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Speaker 4>The fucking problem is I can't talk </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it yet.</v>

303
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.360
<v Speaker 4>Oh my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stopped getting the check.</v>

304
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:26.470
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't like,</v>

305
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll tell you but you can't,</v>

306
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.833
<v Speaker 4>you can't completely reveal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like one of the videos that </v>

307
00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:33.370
<v Speaker 4>would play before you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

308
00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:39.270
<v Speaker 4>first loading up halflife 10,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the new new half life.</v>

309
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.820
<v Speaker 4>The government is hiding a dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

310
00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:43.654
<v Speaker 4>I may have access to just come out was </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they picked up some kind of Ufo </v>

311
00:14:48.971 --> 00:14:53.000
<v Speaker 4>like the government did release Ufo </v>
<v Speaker 4>video.</v>

312
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 3>I always assume this is captain </v>
<v Speaker 3>skeptical over here.</v>

313
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.913
<v Speaker 3>I always assume if the government is </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever sang that there's Ufo shows or </v>

314
00:15:01.881 --> 00:15:02.714
<v Speaker 3>something really crazy like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's to hide some shit they're doing in </v>

315
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:05.864
<v Speaker 3>like Guatemala.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like they don't want anybody to be </v>

316
00:15:08.331 --> 00:15:11.200
<v Speaker 3>paying attention to something weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing so they'll,</v>

317
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.680
<v Speaker 3>they'll just start talking about u of o </v>
<v Speaker 3>is everybody's art for real,</v>

318
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.920
<v Speaker 3>like a real special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got a video man.</v>

319
00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.430
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a really huge question mark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

320
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.860
<v Speaker 4>and there are people out there who like </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

321
00:15:22.861 --> 00:15:23.694
<v Speaker 4>who say they have answers to why they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>just this idea is there is a gradual </v>

322
00:15:27.241 --> 00:15:31.560
<v Speaker 4>dissemination of information that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening because they're,</v>

323
00:15:31.561 --> 00:15:35.220
<v Speaker 4>they're priming the pump and then it </v>
<v Speaker 4>splits into two versions.</v>

324
00:15:35.221 --> 00:15:38.280
<v Speaker 4>One of the versions of the stories is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

325
00:15:38.281 --> 00:15:42.960
<v Speaker 4>if you want to dominate a planet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get them kind of like subconsciously,</v>

326
00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:46.830
<v Speaker 4>subliminally primed for the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

327
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.220
<v Speaker 4>I think there's some really advanced </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology out there and there's,</v>

328
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.090
<v Speaker 4>there's aliens riding around in it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>

329
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.130
<v Speaker 4>and we make contact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've made contact with a,</v>

330
00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.293
<v Speaker 4>they call themselves the Galactic </v>
<v Speaker 4>Council of Celestial elders and they've </v>

331
00:16:01.801 --> 00:16:06.801
<v Speaker 4>been making contact with us for the last</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 years and they've been instructing us</v>

332
00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:09.930
<v Speaker 4>and how to not only reveal themselves to</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

333
00:16:09.931 --> 00:16:10.764
<v Speaker 4>but to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to let the technology come out in a way </v>

334
00:16:12.931 --> 00:16:15.810
<v Speaker 4>that's not going to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>catastrophic for our society.</v>

335
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.080
<v Speaker 4>There are peace loving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wonderful beings,</v>

336
00:16:19.081 --> 00:16:23.880
<v Speaker 4>but we've decided to follow their </v>
<v Speaker 4>instructions to the t and so now they're</v>

337
00:16:23.881 --> 00:16:24.714
<v Speaker 4>ready to introduce themselves and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>suddenly an alien is on TV and suddenly </v>

338
00:16:29.941 --> 00:16:30.774
<v Speaker 4>the government is using a completely </v>
<v Speaker 4>made up thing to try to dominate the </v>

339
00:16:35.491 --> 00:16:36.780
<v Speaker 4>planet by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

340
00:16:36.781 --> 00:16:37.614
<v Speaker 4>it's aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We found them when in fact it's project </v>

341
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.640
<v Speaker 4>blue beam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

342
00:16:41.641 --> 00:16:42.474
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the ideas that are their </v>

343
00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:45.540
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that Shit's true.</v>

344
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:46.643
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a thing that happens when a </v>

345
00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:49.074
<v Speaker 4>planet reaches a certain level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>technological sophistication that it </v>

346
00:16:52.201 --> 00:16:53.034
<v Speaker 4>gets contacted by some kind of order </v>
<v Speaker 4>council federation of Cindy and </v>

347
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:00.803
<v Speaker 4>technological civilizations and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of begin to like walk the planet </v>

348
00:17:06.841 --> 00:17:11.841
<v Speaker 4>through phases of getting that shit out </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the world in a way that isn't going</v>

349
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:15.060
<v Speaker 4>to fuck up their planet and they know </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to do it.</v>

350
00:17:15.061 --> 00:17:18.720
<v Speaker 4>They have a system in place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't come from the stars.</v>

351
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.990
<v Speaker 4>They're not something detectable by </v>
<v Speaker 4>telescopes there.</v>

352
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:22.843
<v Speaker 4>Like in the DMT realm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are there like existing in some </v>

353
00:17:24.781 --> 00:17:28.650
<v Speaker 4>alternate dimension and technology is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just one of the things that they,</v>

354
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:31.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>use to communicate with us.</v>

355
00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:31.780
<v Speaker 4>I've</v>

356
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.540
<v Speaker 3>been toying around with this idea for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>

357
00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:35.403
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time when I'm really high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ideas are a life form that they're </v>

358
00:17:40.211 --> 00:17:43.000
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not as simple as your creativity,</v>

359
00:17:43.001 --> 00:17:46.090
<v Speaker 3>putting together some pieces that </v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't there before.</v>

360
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it's that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's you're</v>

361
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.640
<v Speaker 2>tuning into something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're tuning into some weird,</v>

362
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.510
<v Speaker 2>like some of the ideas almost seem to </v>
<v Speaker 2>write themselves and it could be because</v>

363
00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 2>the subconscious process of your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also could because the,</v>

364
00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:01.613
<v Speaker 2>because that these what ideas are and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what just the concept of thinking is </v>

365
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:09.120
<v Speaker 2>it's essentially the seeds of creation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

366
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.133
<v Speaker 2>Everything that's ever existed on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humans have invented and built came </v>

367
00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 2>from a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It came from thinking,</v>

368
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.050
<v Speaker 2>how do I put together this house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

369
00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.030
<v Speaker 2>how do I put together this skyscraper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I make a plane?</v>

370
00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:26.280
<v Speaker 2>How do I make a TV?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do I make of this?</v>

371
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.800
<v Speaker 2>How do I make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we're vessels for ideas.</v>

372
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.813
<v Speaker 2>We're like sitting there with all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurons firing and electricity going </v>

373
00:18:32.731 --> 00:18:33.564
<v Speaker 2>left and right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these areas of our brains </v>

374
00:18:35.431 --> 00:18:37.890
<v Speaker 2>lighting up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's catching ideas.</v>

375
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.300
<v Speaker 2>When I'm super gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially on edibles,</v>

376
00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:47.360
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I feel like I'm in a river of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas and I'm naked and I can't hold the</v>

377
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 2>fish that just flying by me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

378
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get these ideas right.</v>

379
00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.290
<v Speaker 2>It almost feels like these are not at my</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

380
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.273
<v Speaker 2>These are ideas that I'm working on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've put in the effort to go out and </v>

381
00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 2>fish for these ideas.</v>

382
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Well it's kind of like imagine if there </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a technology that could,</v>

383
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.100
<v Speaker 4>like we send out these signals into </v>
<v Speaker 4>space,</v>

384
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.720
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>satellites with er,</v>

385
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.740
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with fucking records in them,</v>

386
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.510
<v Speaker 4>but perhaps other civilizations are </v>
<v Speaker 4>blasting the planet with ideas,</v>

387
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.180
<v Speaker 4>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are designed to be picked up by the</v>

388
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.400
<v Speaker 4>scope of the human mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

389
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.353
<v Speaker 4>And so what you're doing is you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually like popping into an alien </v>

390
00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:26.324
<v Speaker 4>frequency which is filled with all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>various ideas that are part of the </v>

391
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.033
<v Speaker 4>cultivation of a planet to like try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>get it to the point of like being able </v>

392
00:19:34.251 --> 00:19:36.890
<v Speaker 4>to make contact and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just seeding,</v>

393
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:39.380
<v Speaker 4>seeding us with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with fuck.</v>

394
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.363
<v Speaker 4>When you read like John Lilly and read </v>
<v Speaker 4>about Tesla and read about a lot of the </v>

395
00:19:45.351 --> 00:19:46.184
<v Speaker 4>great inventions that have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people who had the epiphanous </v>

396
00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:50.084
<v Speaker 4>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like there was scrunching </v>

397
00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:52.394
<v Speaker 4>their fucking forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like the idea came to them and a </v>

398
00:19:54.501 --> 00:19:57.050
<v Speaker 4>vision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many times do you hear over and over</v>

399
00:19:57.051 --> 00:19:58.520
<v Speaker 4>again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It came to me in a vision,</v>

400
00:19:58.521 --> 00:19:59.354
<v Speaker 4>a dream.</v>

401
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that the very notion of </v>
<v Speaker 2>science itself,</v>

402
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.953
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came to supposedly like the birth of </v>

403
00:20:04.651 --> 00:20:08.570
<v Speaker 2>science came from a dream that day cards</v>
<v Speaker 2>had really,</v>

404
00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.460
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a dream that,</v>

405
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.520
<v Speaker 2>I forget exactly the term that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they use it,</v>

406
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it was deciphered too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

407
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Like what did he originally speak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What language to car descartes speak?</v>

408
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.620
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know man.</v>

409
00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:23.630
<v Speaker 4>Like I think it was like classic Nerd,</v>

410
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.140
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

411
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.520
<v Speaker 2>he was out like at war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's like campaigning.</v>

412
00:20:33.521 --> 00:20:35.050
<v Speaker 2>He is French,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's French.</v>

413
00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:36.243
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was like he was on a </v>

414
00:20:38.471 --> 00:20:41.710
<v Speaker 2>military campaign in the army or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>

415
00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:42.963
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he signed up for adventure to go off </v>

416
00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:46.444
<v Speaker 2>into the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And during that time period he had a </v>

417
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:53.671
<v Speaker 2>dream that something about to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>harness nature,</v>

418
00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.270
<v Speaker 2>it would be done in weights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>measurements.</v>

419
00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 2>I forget exactly the term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if he could find the term.</v>

420
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.630
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was essentially what people say.</v>

421
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:05.464
<v Speaker 2>This is really when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about the very birth of </v>

422
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.413
<v Speaker 2>the early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could trace back the idea of </v>

423
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:14.120
<v Speaker 2>modern science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the ethics and the ideas,</v>

424
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.240
<v Speaker 2>the concepts of Mondo Science.</v>

425
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.310
<v Speaker 5>Well don't you from a dream don't date </v>
<v Speaker 5>it goes,</v>

426
00:21:17.311 --> 00:21:18.144
<v Speaker 5>I mean before the cart we're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 5>with like it gets really interesting </v>

427
00:21:20.761 --> 00:21:22.270
<v Speaker 5>because you're dealing with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>outcome.</v>

428
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:24.870
<v Speaker 5>It's like John d who were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who were,</v>

429
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean Jon Dee was someone who is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who's John d?</v>

430
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.700
<v Speaker 5>John D is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it like,</v>

431
00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.580
<v Speaker 5>you know Jason Lu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that is,</v>

432
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:32.670
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's an author.</v>

433
00:21:32.671 --> 00:21:35.230
<v Speaker 5>He just wrote this fucking bad ass book </v>
<v Speaker 5>on John D.</v>

434
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.240
<v Speaker 5>Is this one of those people kind kinda </v>
<v Speaker 5>like Crawley who had this huge impact on</v>

435
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:43.590
<v Speaker 5>society but we don't really know a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We would,</v>

436
00:21:43.591 --> 00:21:45.630
<v Speaker 5>most people don't know the fuck he was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

437
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 5>But you've heard of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

438
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:51.780
<v Speaker 5>the Enoki and tablets are like the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Gnocchi and angels basically.</v>

439
00:21:51.781 --> 00:21:52.614
<v Speaker 5>John Dee was like an outcome as to is </v>
<v Speaker 5>working with Queen Elizabeth to try to </v>

440
00:21:57.031 --> 00:21:59.250
<v Speaker 5>turn lead into gold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was a,</v>

441
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.070
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a big fucking pursuit back then,</v>

442
00:22:02.071 --> 00:22:02.791
<v Speaker 5>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shit,</v>

443
00:22:02.791 --> 00:22:06.120
<v Speaker 5>if we could turn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we can transmute metals into gold,</v>

444
00:22:06.121 --> 00:22:07.990
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean they all tried to yeah,</v>

445
00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:08.651
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

446
00:22:08.651 --> 00:22:11.560
<v Speaker 2>Was that when they first started </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing elements?</v>

447
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:13.750
<v Speaker 2>Like when did they first start </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing elements?</v>

448
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:14.970
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

449
00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know probably that it's,</v>

450
00:22:16.871 --> 00:22:19.650
<v Speaker 5>it must be through alchemy cause they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were like trying to break things down to</v>

451
00:22:19.651 --> 00:22:20.484
<v Speaker 5>their fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to break things down to </v>

452
00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:25.650
<v Speaker 5>like their fundamental components.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How many movies are about that?</v>

453
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.300
<v Speaker 5>Someone trying to make gold?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

454
00:22:27.301 --> 00:22:28.134
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the great pursuits and it's </v>

455
00:22:30.931 --> 00:22:32.400
<v Speaker 5>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's that there's a,</v>

456
00:22:32.401 --> 00:22:36.300
<v Speaker 5>it's what we're still doing only we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>not trying to turn a lead into gold.</v>

457
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:38.970
<v Speaker 5>We're trying to turn a lead into a </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking machine.</v>

458
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.510
<v Speaker 5>That's what we're doing that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>better than turning matter and to goal,</v>

459
00:22:42.511 --> 00:22:43.344
<v Speaker 5>if you can turn matter and do a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that is thinking and cindy hunt </v>

460
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.273

<v Speaker 5>process data.</v>

462
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:56.370

<v Speaker 2>you'd be concerned about nuclear weapons</v>

463
00:22:56.371 --> 00:22:57.204
<v Speaker 2>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you would really be concerned about </v>

<v Speaker 2>artificial life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 5>electrical sockets in our heads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>

472
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.693
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

473
00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:20.350
<v Speaker 5>Rome decided to start setting off </v>
<v Speaker 5>nuclear explosions?</v>

474
00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's what an earthquake is.</v>

475
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.313
<v Speaker 5>Maybe when we have an earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like a nuclear test and another </v>

476
00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 5>dimension shaking our planet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I can already hear the light people </v>

479
00:23:34.241 --> 00:23:36.220
<v Speaker 5>being like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>June 8th,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1637 day card cut codifies scientific </v>

482
00:23:42.731 --> 00:23:44.470
<v Speaker 2>method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

483
00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

484
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.873
<v Speaker 3>He outlines his rules for understanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>the natural world through reason and </v>

485
00:23:49.581 --> 00:23:52.040
<v Speaker 3>skepticism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forming the foundation of the scientific</v>

486
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:52.874
<v Speaker 3>method still in use today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There a a term that he had that he came </v>

487
00:23:58.311 --> 00:23:59.144
<v Speaker 3>up with like in a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see if he could find that because there </v>

488
00:24:01.971 --> 00:24:06.230
<v Speaker 3>was like a phrase that he said obviously</v>
<v Speaker 3>translated from French.</v>

489
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:07.333
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

490
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.000
<v Speaker 4>I the reason I s the dit cart fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>bugs before him,</v>

491
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:11.691
<v Speaker 4>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

492
00:24:11.691 --> 00:24:13.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think therefore I am.</v>

493
00:24:13.231 --> 00:24:14.064
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was obviously an interesting </v>

494
00:24:15.891 --> 00:24:17.600
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He liked to do shit like,</v>

495
00:24:17.601 --> 00:24:19.250
<v Speaker 4>and I could be wrong about this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

496
00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.820
<v Speaker 4>I clearly remember reading about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>

497
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.713
<v Speaker 4>what do you call it mechanistically or </v>
<v Speaker 4>like he believed the animals were just </v>

498
00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:28.490
<v Speaker 4>machines basically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

499
00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:29.683
<v Speaker 4>so like he would like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I love Jamie if you could look this </v>

500
00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:34.070
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't get a suede with people being</v>

501
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:35.420
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a different person.</v>

502
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.523
<v Speaker 4>But apparently he would do shit like </v>
<v Speaker 4>hold that dog's beating heart and it's </v>

503
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:42.290
<v Speaker 4>in his hand while it died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

504
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:43.363
<v Speaker 4>And he said things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who are afraid to kick dogs </v>

505
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:48.950
<v Speaker 4>aren't really my students because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>know it will look that up,</v>

506
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:49.701
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We share this,</v>

507
00:24:49.701 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 4>not like propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If there was like an info wars.com</v>

508
00:24:53.181 --> 00:24:56.780
<v Speaker 4>back then like what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why I'm covering it with like,</v>

509
00:24:56.781 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying he's out there kicking </v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs.</v>

510
00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:59.503
<v Speaker 4>I think he was kicking dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the cart like I just found it </v>

511
00:25:01.491 --> 00:25:02.324
<v Speaker 4>was pretty rough.</v>

512
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they all kick dogs back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a nutshell,</v>

513
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:09.440
<v Speaker 3>frank fro philosopher Rene decartes </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't believe animals had souls to test</v>

514
00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:10.274
<v Speaker 3>his theory.</v>

515
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:14.240
<v Speaker 4>Nailed his wife's dog to a board and </v>
<v Speaker 4>chopped it open while the poor thing was</v>

516
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:16.340
<v Speaker 4>still a long guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fun Guy.</v>

00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:19.210
<v Speaker 4>Crater is science was a nail and dogs to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking boards.</v>

518
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.120
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you read this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do we know it's on fucking hard.com?</v>

519
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.003
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's nuts.</v>

520
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 4>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hope that you really are knowledge,</v>

521
00:25:27.201 --> 00:25:29.090
<v Speaker 4>nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuts for knowledge.</v>

522
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.583
<v Speaker 4>I love nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy definitely looks like he </v>

523
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:36.560
<v Speaker 4>fucking Nail Dogs to boards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that fucking face.</v>

524
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Mm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mm.</v>

525
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>

526
00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:39.923
<v Speaker 3>Squirm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The greatest minds are capable of the </v>

527
00:25:42.191 --> 00:25:44.650
<v Speaker 3>greatest vices as well as the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>virtues.</v>

528
00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said after cut open a </v>
<v Speaker 3>cat,</v>

529
00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.270
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like,</v>

530
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:52.770
<v Speaker 4>it's the father of science is also like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's Jeffrey Dahmer Level Shit too.</v>

531
00:25:52.771 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 4>Like he was not,</v>

532
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:56.410
<v Speaker 3>I think people did a lot of that back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

533
00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.530
<v Speaker 3>Nayland dogs divorce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just think the,</v>

534
00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:03.130
<v Speaker 3>I think the value of life was severely </v>
<v Speaker 3>diminished.</v>

535
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.730
<v Speaker 3>I think back then the 16 hundreds people</v>
<v Speaker 3>were dying left and right of everything.</v>

536
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:11.080
<v Speaker 3>You got a cold dead break your leg dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get gored by a bull,</v>

537
00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.760
<v Speaker 3>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything dead.</v>

538
00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got an infection dead.</v>

539
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.660
<v Speaker 3>Well you got the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably dead.</v>

540
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:16.980
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

541
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.260
<v Speaker 4>that's definitely in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in India.</v>

542
00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying in India it was like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>utopia and everyone is sweet to animals,</v>

543
00:26:22.951 --> 00:26:25.920
<v Speaker 4>but in Buddhism it was still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like there was,</v>

544
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:28.800
<v Speaker 4>it was a lot more compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's true.</v>

545
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Why do you think that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>APP</v>

546
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:30.633
<v Speaker 3>and why does like like Thailand and </v>
<v Speaker 3>places that are Buddhist places </v>

547
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.583
<v Speaker 3>generally?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously there's violence </v>

548
00:26:36.001 --> 00:26:39.480
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but generally more of a peaceful vibe.</v>

549
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.513
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Buddhist nations and Buddhist </v>

550
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 3>crying a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously flaws with everything.</v>

551
00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:45.763
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything involving people you're going </v>

552
00:26:46.951 --> 00:26:47.784
<v Speaker 3>to have outliers but over and all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like one of the things that my friend </v>

553
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 3>was telling me about Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>

554
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no crime over there.</v>

555
00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just go over there.</v>

556
00:26:56.131 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 3>He's like everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like real easy,</v>

557
00:26:58.141 --> 00:27:01.350
<v Speaker 3>real easy to get along with everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's super safe.</v>

558
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:03.750
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gets robbed was it's really rare.</v>

559
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.190
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

560
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:06.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>

561
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.073
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand why that way of </v>
<v Speaker 5>thinking emerged in the east and that </v>

562
00:27:13.961 --> 00:27:16.570
<v Speaker 5>connection with the south emerged in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>east first,</v>

563
00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:17.523
<v Speaker 5>what happened in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was basically decimation of a </v>

564
00:27:21.011 --> 00:27:24.070
<v Speaker 5>previous religion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

565
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.680
<v Speaker 5>Paganism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever you want to call it.</v>

566
00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.630
<v Speaker 5>Earth based religion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>connection with life and nature,</v>

567
00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.643
<v Speaker 5>but what's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

568
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:30.493
<v Speaker 3>tell me about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it the DNA of paganism is still in </v>

569
00:27:32.301 --> 00:27:34.430
<v Speaker 3>the system?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like we absorbed it.</v>

570
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I say,</v>

571
00:27:35.901 --> 00:27:37.610
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean Christians,</v>

572
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian nation.</v>

573
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.261
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

574
00:27:39.261 --> 00:27:40.610
<v Speaker 5>it's work Christian nation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

575
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.473
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure we've talked about this in the </v>

576
00:27:42.201 --> 00:27:44.210
<v Speaker 5>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's something I marvel over all the</v>

577
00:27:44.211 --> 00:27:45.650
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think about it a lot,</v>

578
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.543
<v Speaker 5>which is the Catholic mass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's when you look at the Catholic mass </v>

579
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.840
<v Speaker 5>and you look at the New Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last supper,</v>

580
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.830
<v Speaker 5>and you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you realize like in the fucking synoptic</v>

581
00:27:57.831 --> 00:28:02.831
<v Speaker 5>gospels and then any of the gospels,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there is nowhere that Jesus is saying.</v>

582
00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:04.243
<v Speaker 5>What you do is take a piece of bread and</v>
<v Speaker 5>utter these prayers over it to create </v>

583
00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:12.620
<v Speaker 5>it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to create my flash that didn't you eat,</v>

584
00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.820
<v Speaker 5>it's not there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The ritual isn't there and but,</v>

585
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:21.620
<v Speaker 5>but the interpretation of that has </v>
<v Speaker 5>turned into what is called high magic.</v>

586
00:28:21.621 --> 00:28:22.454
<v Speaker 5>It's called like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a ceremonial magic where you are </v>

587
00:28:25.790 --> 00:28:26.623
<v Speaker 5>transforming bread into the flesh of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>sacrificed God and people do that every </v>

588
00:28:34.071 --> 00:28:37.910
<v Speaker 5>fucking Sunday and are like this totally</v>
<v Speaker 5>normal magic.</v>

589
00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:40.220
<v Speaker 5>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not in a fucking magic.</v>

590
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:41.323
<v Speaker 5>What I do is I eat the flesh of a god </v>
<v Speaker 5>that was sacrificed by Father God so </v>

591
00:28:50.661 --> 00:28:54.320
<v Speaker 5>that my sins could be purified.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's not magic.</v>

592
00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.680
<v Speaker 5>When did that originate the sacrament?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

593
00:28:57.681 --> 00:28:59.720
<v Speaker 5>I've read that it has something to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>

594
00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:01.080
<v Speaker 5>it goes back to Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it,</v>

595
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.963
<v Speaker 5>that it's some kind of high magic </v>
<v Speaker 5>Egyptian ritual mushroom or as a </v>

596
00:29:05.781 --> 00:29:06.470
<v Speaker 5>mushroom</v>

597
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:07.303
<v Speaker 3>probably had a big bag of mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody came up and they put it on </v>

598
00:29:10.281 --> 00:29:11.780
<v Speaker 3>your tongue and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>good luck.</v>

599
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know.</v>

600
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:14.670
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the place he on the other side.</v>

601
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:15.570
<v Speaker 5>I mean they said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

602
00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:16.404
<v Speaker 5>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

603
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the flesh of God.</v>

604
00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:19.523
<v Speaker 5>Eat this to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you'll remember who you truly are </v>

605
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:22.883
<v Speaker 5>and they gave you this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the psychedelic and you took it and you </v>

606
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:26.183
<v Speaker 5>merged back into the divine and realize </v>
<v Speaker 5>your true identity so that for the rest </v>

607
00:29:29.881 --> 00:29:30.714
<v Speaker 5>of the week you were able to hang out </v>
<v Speaker 5>with people and not be a complete ass </v>

608
00:29:33.141 --> 00:29:33.781
<v Speaker 5>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause you know,</v>

609
00:29:33.781 --> 00:29:34.614
<v Speaker 5>you share the same soul and that you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically made of love as opposed to </v>

610
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.200
<v Speaker 5>thinking that you and I are separate and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that</v>

611
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.010
<v Speaker 4>were mostly sinful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil things.</v>

612
00:29:45.011 --> 00:29:49.750
<v Speaker 4>Who's flashes impure?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's another fucking sweet gift</v>

613
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:50.584
<v Speaker 4>that came from um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fundamentalist Christianity is the </v>

614
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:58.651
<v Speaker 4>concept that our bodies are evil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't be naked around each other.</v>

615
00:29:58.841 --> 00:29:59.674
<v Speaker 4>Even now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't take your clothes off </v>

616
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.890
<v Speaker 4>around people without seeming completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>insane.</v>

617
00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.753
<v Speaker 4>You will get a wreck if you go outside </v>
<v Speaker 4>and your fundamental body that you are </v>

618
00:30:11.681 --> 00:30:15.670
<v Speaker 4>born into the universe with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you will get arrested.</v>

619
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.253
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't walk around as you are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to cover it in clothes or if </v>

620
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.770
<v Speaker 4>you're considered to be a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>pervert,</v>

621
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Speaker 4>pervert,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nudist,</v>

622
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.380
<v Speaker 4>psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

623
00:30:26.381 --> 00:30:27.214
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fundamental vehicle that we are so </v>

624
00:30:29.201 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 4>rides around and it's considered profane</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

625
00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:33.670
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do dude.</v>

626
00:30:33.671 --> 00:30:34.504
<v Speaker 4>And it like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see a fucking deck when you're like </v>

627
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:38.880
<v Speaker 4>walking down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some dudes you're like,</v>

628
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.710
<v Speaker 4>well you can see a dick accidentally at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bathroom and it doesn't bother,</v>

629
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.350
<v Speaker 4>doesn't bother you.</v>

630
00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.183
<v Speaker 4>Cause in the bathroom it's okay for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment to profane the world with your </v>

631
00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:52.030
<v Speaker 4>fucking Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like that's the,</v>

632
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.250
<v Speaker 4>when you start really looking at all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

633
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.610
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the traces of not just pagan culture,</v>

634
00:30:57.611 --> 00:31:02.611
<v Speaker 4>but just insanity from a fundamentalist </v>
<v Speaker 4>perspective of the universe that has its</v>

635
00:31:03.041 --> 00:31:03.874
<v Speaker 4>roots in what appears to be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>misunderstanding of a really beautiful </v>

636
00:31:07.001 --> 00:31:10.180
<v Speaker 4>story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it's like mind boggling.</v>

637
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:11.890
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not just a misunderstanding,</v>

638
00:31:11.891 --> 00:31:12.724
<v Speaker 4>but probably a conscious </v>
<v Speaker 4>misrepresentation of the original store </v>

639
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:16.804
<v Speaker 4>that's molded the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoever's needs is in charge at the </v>

640
00:31:19.001 --> 00:31:20.050
<v Speaker 4>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

641
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And people do,</v>

642
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.390
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

643
00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 4>Catholics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feel guilty like they should.</v>

644
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:27.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm Catholic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're filling.</v>

645
00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.960
<v Speaker 4>You still probably feel a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably a little bit,</v>

646
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:29.741
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking,</v>

647
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 4>I'm not Catholic really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was,</v>

648
00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.220
<v Speaker 4>when I was in first grade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have this allister Croley poster.</v>

649
00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 4>I was going to bring the uterus seven Oh</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow.</v>

650
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:41.500
<v Speaker 4>1079 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

651
00:31:41.501 --> 00:31:44.380
<v Speaker 4>It was the year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The year 1000 that's it sounds like it's</v>

652
00:31:44.381 --> 00:31:45.720
<v Speaker 4>a weird sounding name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

653
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:46.623
<v Speaker 4>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Other 1079 it feels like I'm saying </v>

654
00:31:48.521 --> 00:31:49.600
<v Speaker 4>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

655
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:50.621
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

656
00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:51.580
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

657
00:31:51.700 --> 00:31:56.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1079 so this is way after Jesus almost a</v>

658
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.650
<v Speaker 4>thousand years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

659
00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:00.700
<v Speaker 4>They started doing the magical ritual </v>
<v Speaker 4>and and so it's like to say that this is</v>

660
00:32:00.701 --> 00:32:04.960
<v Speaker 4>connected to Christianity is really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like actually no,</v>

661
00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 4>it's Christianity's a song and this is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dance people decided to do to it,</v>

662
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:10.780
<v Speaker 4>but to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

663
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:16.290
<v Speaker 4>To say that it's like that it has </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything to do with Jesus is,</v>

664
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:17.373
<v Speaker 4>is not true unless you're going to say </v>
<v Speaker 4>that Jesus transmitted the data after </v>

665
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:23.370
<v Speaker 4>his death and do some kind of mistake or</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

666
00:32:23.371 --> 00:32:24.204
<v Speaker 4>or who had the vision of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm not knocking the fucking </v>

667
00:32:27.401 --> 00:32:29.620
<v Speaker 4>Catholic mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's beautiful,</v>

668
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.500
<v Speaker 4>but let's just admit what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Magic.</v>

669
00:32:32.501 --> 00:32:33.334
<v Speaker 4>It's ritual magic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're doing ritual magic and you're </v>

670
00:32:36.011 --> 00:32:38.950
<v Speaker 4>doing something that's been going on for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very long,</v>

671
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 4>probably before 1079</v>

672
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 5>that dude wasn't just like sitting </v>
<v Speaker 5>around.</v>

673
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:43.641
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

674
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:46.640
<v Speaker 5>I got an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's start saying prayer over the bread</v>

675
00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:48.380
<v Speaker 5>and the bread is going to turn into </v>
<v Speaker 5>flesh.</v>

676
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.480
<v Speaker 5>It was more like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

677
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:51.314
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been meeting doing these rituals </v>

678
00:32:53.211 --> 00:32:54.044
<v Speaker 5>secretly.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why don't we just incorporate the story </v>

679
00:32:56.541 --> 00:33:01.541
<v Speaker 5>of Christianity into this ritual that </v>
<v Speaker 5>we've been doing for a very long time.</v>

680
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:04.100
<v Speaker 5>Do you sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

681
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.473
<v Speaker 5>pure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>purify ourselves by connecting to the </v>

682
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:08.054
<v Speaker 5>universe and acknowledging the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 5>existence itself is predicated on </v>

683
00:33:12.321 --> 00:33:15.230
<v Speaker 5>devouring the flash of some other being </v>
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

684
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:16.064
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're always in the process of </v>

685
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.373
<v Speaker 5>inhaling the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exhaling the universe eating each other </v>

686
00:33:22.411 --> 00:33:23.244
<v Speaker 5>in the universe is eating itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so the mass is this ritualized </v>

687
00:33:26.331 --> 00:33:28.160
<v Speaker 5>version of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>behold,</v>

688
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.010
<v Speaker 5>we're eating the flesh of God in </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything we do.</v>

689
00:33:31.011 --> 00:33:32.530
<v Speaker 5>And there's something really beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 5>about that.</v>

690
00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.753
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no getting around life eats </v>

691
00:33:35.861 --> 00:33:38.660
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the various factions of,</v>

692
00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.440
<v Speaker 3>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people on the left and the right and,</v>

693
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:42.743
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are animal rights activists </v>

694
00:33:45.701 --> 00:33:46.534
<v Speaker 3>versus people that are butchers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're all eating something that's </v>

695
00:33:50.111 --> 00:33:51.040
<v Speaker 3>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

696
00:33:51.041 --> 00:33:54.520
<v Speaker 3>you can make the distinction that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plants aren't suffering like the animals</v>

697
00:33:54.521 --> 00:33:55.890
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it's okay.</v>

698
00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree with you.</v>

699
00:33:57.460 --> 00:33:58.293
<v Speaker 3>For the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's probably a less extreme form of </v>

700
00:34:00.101 --> 00:34:00.934
<v Speaker 3>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also might just be a completely </v>

701
00:34:02.501 --> 00:34:03.334
<v Speaker 3>misunderstood life form like there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well they're finding out so much about </v>

702
00:34:07.151 --> 00:34:09.940
<v Speaker 3>plant communication and I've read so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many things about that.</v>

703
00:34:09.941 --> 00:34:10.774
<v Speaker 3>I hesitate to talk about it cause I </v>
<v Speaker 3>really want to have all my t's sliced </v>

704
00:34:14.141 --> 00:34:17.950
<v Speaker 3>and i's dotted because it's such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex issue,</v>

705
00:34:17.951 --> 00:34:21.790
<v Speaker 3>but it appears that they communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It appears that there's almost like a,</v>

706
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:26.810
<v Speaker 3>that they're using the soil and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fungus in the soil and the mycelium,</v>

707
00:34:27.311 --> 00:34:28.144
<v Speaker 3>they all have this weird ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just like one plant by itself </v>

708
00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.040
<v Speaker 3>in the dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

709
00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.250
<v Speaker 3>there's a network that they're connected</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

710
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.700
<v Speaker 5>Did Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's this thing,</v>

711
00:34:38.701 --> 00:34:39.534
<v Speaker 5>I've just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this guy gave me this thing called a </v>

712
00:34:40.171 --> 00:34:42.510
<v Speaker 5>middy sprout,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>

713
00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:43.883
<v Speaker 5>it picks up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess the bioelectricity of plants or </v>

714
00:34:45.991 --> 00:34:47.890
<v Speaker 5>anything for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But plants I've,</v>

715
00:34:47.891 --> 00:34:48.724
<v Speaker 5>I've got it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You stick it on your plant and it goes </v>

716
00:34:50.551 --> 00:34:51.384
<v Speaker 5>into like your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever your music system is and it </v>

717
00:34:53.431 --> 00:34:56.130
<v Speaker 5>translates it into Midi so you can turn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>turn,</v>

718
00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:59.200
<v Speaker 5>turn the electricity of your plant and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>music.</v>

719
00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:01.500
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's fucking cool.</v>

720
00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:03.323
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

721
00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:07.423
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That sound is the sound's coming from a </v>

722
00:35:09.681 --> 00:35:10.514
<v Speaker 6>tree.</v>

723
00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:11.843
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's the electricity of the tree being </v>

724
00:35:12.751 --> 00:35:13.584
<v Speaker 5>translated in a middy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is then being translated into </v>

725
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.520
<v Speaker 5>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's,</v>

726
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:19.620
<v Speaker 5>it's a way to convert that data into </v>
<v Speaker 5>music.</v>

727
00:35:19.621 --> 00:35:22.320
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're converting the bio </v>
<v Speaker 5>electricity into,</v>

728
00:35:22.321 --> 00:35:24.060
<v Speaker 5>it's not like that's the sound of a </v>
<v Speaker 5>plant.</v>

729
00:35:24.061 --> 00:35:24.894
<v Speaker 5>It's not making celestial noises.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just sending energy and creating </v>

730
00:35:28.381 --> 00:35:29.214
<v Speaker 5>mini,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is then being translated into the </v>

731
00:35:30.211 --> 00:35:31.044
<v Speaker 5>sound.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's a way to observe the data </v>

732
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.460
<v Speaker 5>instead of looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess on an Oscilloscope or whatever,</v>

733
00:35:35.461 --> 00:35:37.030
<v Speaker 5>you would look at that with.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

734
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 5>it's turning into,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into</v>

735
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.843
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the audio so you can hear the </v>

736
00:35:39.601 --> 00:35:40.434
<v Speaker 3>pulsating kind of like rhythmic flow so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's measuring electrical currents </v>

737
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:46.770
<v Speaker 3>in the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

738
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.670
<v Speaker 3>so there's that much of a variation that</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like going up and down all the time</v>

739
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

740
00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:52.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

741
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.993
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that the total math behind </v>

742
00:35:55.581 --> 00:35:57.090
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I've got one on my,</v>

743
00:35:57.091 --> 00:36:00.390
<v Speaker 3>I'm on a plan in my studio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's my take on it.</v>

744
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.150
<v Speaker 3>The most potent psychedelic experience </v>
<v Speaker 3>is dmt.</v>

745
00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 3>DMT exists in so many different plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in thousands of plants.</v>

746
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.480
<v Speaker 3>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have no idea why,</v>

747
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:12.080
<v Speaker 3>but it's in them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if it wasn't for Mano,</v>

748
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.090
<v Speaker 3>Amy's Mano,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amy's Oxidase,</v>

749
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.040
<v Speaker 3>monoamine oxidase Mao,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is what Mao inhibitors are.</v>

750
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.410
<v Speaker 3>If it wasn't for that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have this in our body,</v>

751
00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:25.590
<v Speaker 3>we would be tripping on salad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be tripping on grass.</v>

752
00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:26.683
<v Speaker 3>You eat certain grasses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be blasted off to the center of </v>

753
00:36:28.381 --> 00:36:29.214
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>

754
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:30.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for some sheep,</v>

755
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:33.790
<v Speaker 3>DMT is poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they get ahold of,</v>

756
00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:36.180
<v Speaker 3>of plants that have DNP even they fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

757
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.580
<v Speaker 3>has the legs and the legs start bucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>up in the air.</v>

758
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:39.533
<v Speaker 3>That's like a canary in the coal mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He takes sheep out into nature and when </v>

759
00:36:42.181 --> 00:36:43.710
<v Speaker 3>they start dying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what you eat.</v>

760
00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.830
<v Speaker 3>I think it's [inaudible] grass in </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular.</v>

761
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:47.783
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a type of grass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's if you could find that grass </v>

762
00:36:50.781 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 3>that kill sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a grass.</v>

763
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 3>A particularly rich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

764
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:54.901
<v Speaker 3>Florist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

765
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:56.300
<v Speaker 3>How good's the memory on the kid even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though he's,</v>

766
00:36:56.301 --> 00:36:59.730
<v Speaker 3>Hi Phillip Morris back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

767
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:00.803
<v Speaker 3>That a flare induced Valera staggers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>chief portions of the lower brain as </v>

768
00:37:05.281 --> 00:37:09.030
<v Speaker 3>seen to be damaged and oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tinted blue.</v>

769
00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:10.163
<v Speaker 3>They're responsible agents or the </v>
<v Speaker 3>alkaloids contained in the various </v>

770
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:17.220
<v Speaker 3>failing species.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are whispered rumors that can you,</v>

771
00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.323
<v Speaker 3>there are whispered fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a dmt website to that whispered </v>

772
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:21.750
<v Speaker 3>rumors.</v>

773
00:37:21.750 --> 00:37:26.280
<v Speaker 3>He's got a science not looking for wispy</v>
<v Speaker 3>are whispers,</v>

774
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.620
<v Speaker 3>whispered rumors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hippies.</v>

775
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:33.830
<v Speaker 3>The divine moment of truth is that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>one that I'm in is one of those spangled</v>

776
00:37:33.831 --> 00:37:36.990
<v Speaker 3>made one where they use the a rant of me</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Jim Brewer.</v>

777
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.660
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was harp acute.</v>

778
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.750
<v Speaker 3>I barely remember what I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as me and brewer,</v>

779
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're high on pot lollipops or Jesus and</v>

780
00:37:47.011 --> 00:37:47.844
<v Speaker 3>they took that and took part of it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>made it this really dope music end with </v>

781
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:54.870
<v Speaker 3>a video to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's their video,</v>

782
00:37:54.871 --> 00:37:56.700
<v Speaker 3>if they made that video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

783
00:37:56.701 --> 00:38:01.020
<v Speaker 3>It looks oddly similar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a tone down,</v>

784
00:38:01.021 --> 00:38:05.160
<v Speaker 3>like a pencil drawing of what you see </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you do dmt and then,</v>

785
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a sound.</v>

786
00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.740
<v Speaker 3>That's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

787
00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:11.940
<v Speaker 3>I the good old day time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>

788
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Weren't those the good old days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now we don't do it anymore though.</v>

789
00:38:15.391 --> 00:38:16.410
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's elite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

790
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Why would we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

791
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:18.750
<v Speaker 3>it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no need.</v>

792
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.673
<v Speaker 3>And also once you've been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like you have to keep going </v>

793
00:38:20.971 --> 00:38:25.170
<v Speaker 3>back just enough now Santa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need these fucking,</v>

794
00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.820
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to do right now.</v>

795
00:38:26.821 --> 00:38:28.520
<v Speaker 3>Get a better accountant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

796
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.320
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>

797
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.750
<v Speaker 3>there's some fucking great accountants </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the DMT realm.</v>

798
00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:34.643
<v Speaker 3>That's when I'll start doing right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're accountants of your </v>

799
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:37.520
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and they look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go on.</v>

800
00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:38.963
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

801
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 4>It's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

802
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:46.550
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty not too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you get a finger wagging at you?</v>

803
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

804
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:51.043
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was like when I had a wacky </v>

805
00:38:52.541 --> 00:38:53.950
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a bad thought,</v>

806
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:56.800
<v Speaker 3>a thought when a rag that was on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong page.</v>

807
00:38:56.801 --> 00:38:58.710
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this isn't an that's cool.</v>

808
00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:00.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>

809
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:03.700
<v Speaker 4>I love the in different psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 4>states.</v>

810
00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:04.803
<v Speaker 4>I love how you witnessed how your </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness is forming your reality </v>

811
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:11.090
<v Speaker 4>and the most extreme way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

812
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.023
<v Speaker 4>Not as though like you're producing </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter with your thoughts or anything </v>

813
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:15.184
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can watch this undulation or </v>

814
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:22.180
<v Speaker 4>this flow going from when you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>negative and dark.</v>

815
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.560
<v Speaker 4>And it's interesting how different </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics portray this phenomena.</v>

816
00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.250
<v Speaker 4>But so like on acid you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might see,</v>

817
00:39:30.251 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 4>depending if I'm taking a high enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>dose,</v>

818
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:36.100
<v Speaker 4>you start seeing like the faces and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the Stucco of your ceiling,</v>

819
00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:36.934
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like when you start getting </v>

820
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:42.430
<v Speaker 4>really depressive or scared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then the phases start doing like</v>

821
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:43.383
<v Speaker 7>oh</v>

822
00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.090
<v Speaker 4>his thing at you and they seek in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

823
00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.350
<v Speaker 4>or even when you're looking at yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the mirror you,</v>

824
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.223
<v Speaker 4>the a similar things happens is you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just watching the way that your </v>

825
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:54.283
<v Speaker 4>projection that's coming from the </v>
<v Speaker 4>incessant flow of thoughts in your mind </v>

826
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.023
<v Speaker 4>is reflecting on the reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's a constant like shifting of </v>

827
00:40:03.591 --> 00:40:08.210
<v Speaker 4>light that sometimes is like looking </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the deepest layers of hell.</v>

828
00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:11.990
<v Speaker 4>But then sometimes you see the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful,</v>

829
00:40:11.991 --> 00:40:16.070
<v Speaker 4>sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible things because your not being</v>

830
00:40:16.071 --> 00:40:18.770
<v Speaker 4>freaked out by the flow of thoughts in </v>
<v Speaker 4>your mind.</v>

831
00:40:18.771 --> 00:40:20.690
<v Speaker 4>That's the number one trick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

832
00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:21.673
<v Speaker 4>this is why now my old age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really do understand why I'm a good </v>

833
00:40:27.201 --> 00:40:29.180
<v Speaker 4>practice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation,</v>

834
00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.710
<v Speaker 4>chanting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

835
00:40:30.711 --> 00:40:33.230
<v Speaker 4>It may be pair so nicely with </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics.</v>

836
00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you have one without the other,</v>

837
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.900
<v Speaker 4>well you're missing out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But also your,</v>

838
00:40:38.901 --> 00:40:43.430
<v Speaker 4>you can really like go into some pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>terrifying places that you'd,</v>

839
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:44.383
<v Speaker 4>that don't resolve in the way that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>could potentially if you are doing the </v>

840
00:40:48.651 --> 00:40:49.484
<v Speaker 4>work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting in the time before you take the </v>

841
00:40:51.021 --> 00:40:52.130
<v Speaker 4>Psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

842
00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.440
<v Speaker 4>not to sound like an old fucking guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>like guy you got to,</v>

843
00:40:54.441 --> 00:40:55.274
<v Speaker 4>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

844
00:40:55.450 --> 00:40:58.670
<v Speaker 4>meditate and then too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it does help a lot.</v>

845
00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.733
<v Speaker 4>Well it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

846
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.863
<v Speaker 3>there's a weird way that we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we want to dismiss it because it seems </v>

847
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.573
<v Speaker 3>almost like a pompous thing to ever say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You meditate or you encourage people to </v>

848
00:41:08.071 --> 00:41:08.904
<v Speaker 3>meds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

849
00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.060
<v Speaker 3>Like the same as I always have a cringy </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing when I tell people to do yoga.</v>

850
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:15.180
<v Speaker 3>Like am I going have to say this again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I really mean it.</v>

851
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.223
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like yoga is one of the very</v>
<v Speaker 3>best things that will pair with a </v>

852
00:41:19.261 --> 00:41:21.280
<v Speaker 3>cannabis use and with psychedelic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

853
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.570
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it alleviates a lot.</v>

854
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.423
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another thing is really good is running </v>

855
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:26.593
<v Speaker 3>and I think both those things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they alleviate a certain amount of </v>

856
00:41:29.521 --> 00:41:31.870
<v Speaker 3>anxiety and they create,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

857
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.250
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a blood through that.</v>

858
00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:35.143
<v Speaker 8>Like when you're really pumping hard up </v>
<v Speaker 8>a hill and you're running the huffing </v>

859
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:38.594
<v Speaker 8>and puffing and you make it and you </v>
<v Speaker 8>check your pulse and you recover quick </v>

860
00:41:41.571 --> 00:41:44.030
<v Speaker 8>and he'd go and do another hill run,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a,</v>

861
00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:48.320
<v Speaker 8>there's a stimulation of your body </v>
<v Speaker 8>because it's being forced to work hard,</v>

862
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.303
<v Speaker 8>that's euphoric and after it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 8>your brain's flooded with all these </v>

863
00:41:52.221 --> 00:41:54.620
<v Speaker 8>wonderful chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You feel good,</v>

864
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:55.633
<v Speaker 8>you feel friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And like I think that paired with </v>

865
00:41:58.401 --> 00:41:59.234
<v Speaker 8>psychedelic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think exercise is one of the most </v>

866
00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:04.340
<v Speaker 8>overlooked,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so important.</v>

867
00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:07.550
<v Speaker 8>And it doesn't matter what style,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like what you enjoy doing,</v>

868
00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.700
<v Speaker 8>but just got to get that blood going.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You got to do something.</v>

869
00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:15.940
<v Speaker 8>Whether it's take a spin class or a yoga</v>
<v Speaker 8>class or go for a good hike,</v>

870
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.113
<v Speaker 8>do something where you're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>huffing and puffing and you're really </v>

871
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:19.934
<v Speaker 8>getting in some work,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're really sweating and your body </v>

872
00:42:21.531 --> 00:42:21.980
<v Speaker 8>will just feel</v>

873
00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:22.461
<v Speaker 5>better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

874
00:42:22.461 --> 00:42:23.294
<v Speaker 5>this is what you just said exactly </v>
<v Speaker 5>applies to meditation and also you're </v>

875
00:42:26.721 --> 00:42:27.554
<v Speaker 5>fucking right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem with even talking about it </v>

876
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:31.630
<v Speaker 5>is you sound virtue signally and pompous</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it sends it.</v>

877
00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.260
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's true.</v>

878
00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.930
<v Speaker 5>And when you hear Ron doss talk about </v>
<v Speaker 5>meditation,</v>

879
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:37.063
<v Speaker 5>he will say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't meditate when you want to </v>

880
00:42:39.651 --> 00:42:40.730
<v Speaker 5>meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like don't,</v>

881
00:42:40.731 --> 00:42:43.760
<v Speaker 5>don't even like if it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that appeals to you,</v>

882
00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.800
<v Speaker 5>give it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the,</v>

883
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.270
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

884
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.640
<v Speaker 5>the definition of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's sat.</v>

885
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:52.130
<v Speaker 5>What's funny is when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>meditation,</v>

886
00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:57.140
<v Speaker 5>your mind will summon up something that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you think meditation looks like.</v>

887
00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:57.974
<v Speaker 5>So you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's like sitting down on a </v>

888
00:42:59.811 --> 00:43:04.811
<v Speaker 5>cushion with some fucking candles or it </v>
<v Speaker 5>means like whatever it is that your mind</v>

889
00:43:04.881 --> 00:43:05.714
<v Speaker 5>summons up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And usually it's pretty austere and </v>

890
00:43:07.821 --> 00:43:08.654
<v Speaker 5>usually it's pretty requires like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>temple or a space in your house or it's </v>

891
00:43:11.751 --> 00:43:15.290
<v Speaker 5>in south and I'll phone you need a robe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

892
00:43:15.291 --> 00:43:17.390
<v Speaker 5>He needs some kind of like shit that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're wearing,</v>

893
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:19.603
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because your mind is trying to push it </v>

894
00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 5>off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's trying to like your mind.</v>

895
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.373
<v Speaker 5>It W it was as one of its functions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It seems to like not want you to sit </v>

896
00:43:27.711 --> 00:43:31.820
<v Speaker 5>still for a moment and watch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what you just said about exercising,</v>

897
00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:32.923
<v Speaker 5>it's true for meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's so many different </v>

898
00:43:34.941 --> 00:43:35.774
<v Speaker 5>versions of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I would argue running is a </v>

899
00:43:38.001 --> 00:43:40.690
<v Speaker 5>meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Working out is a meditation.</v>

900
00:43:40.691 --> 00:43:42.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that to think that it's,</v>

901
00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:44.710
<v Speaker 5>there's a separation there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There really isn't.</v>

902
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.920
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't think there was either.</v>

903
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.130
<v Speaker 8>I always just said that about martial </v>
<v Speaker 8>arts.</v>

904
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.990
<v Speaker 8>I believe that martial arts were a </v>
<v Speaker 8>moving form of meditation,</v>

905
00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:51.973
<v Speaker 8>but that doesn't mean like stationary </v>
<v Speaker 8>meditation isn't different and give you </v>

906
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.963
<v Speaker 8>a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>another very valuable thing and a </v>

907
00:43:57.511 --> 00:43:58.980
<v Speaker 8>different,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a different valuable stuff.</v>

908
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well it gives you the ability to,</v>

909
00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.620
<v Speaker 5>I was just reading,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a great book I'm reading by Pema</v>

910
00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:07.620
<v Speaker 5>Chodron called the wisdom and no escape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

911
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.030
<v Speaker 5>she talks about how when people start </v>
<v Speaker 5>meditating they think,</v>

912
00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:13.343
<v Speaker 5>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing this because I want to be a </v>

913
00:44:14.011 --> 00:44:16.410
<v Speaker 5>better person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she said,</v>

914
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:17.573
<v Speaker 5>that's actually an aggression against </v>
<v Speaker 5>the south that you are right now to be </v>

915
00:44:21.361 --> 00:44:22.111
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ooh.</v>

916
00:44:22.111 --> 00:44:24.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting.</v>

917
00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

918
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.360
<v Speaker 5>That you're actually being like </v>
<v Speaker 5>aggressive to your own self.</v>

919
00:44:27.361 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 5>She said meditation is not so that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>become a better it</v>

920
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:32.873
<v Speaker 4>so that we're able to be who we are and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the moment fully and to begin to </v>

921
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:42.711
<v Speaker 4>experience fully what it is that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening inside of us because for a lot</v>

922
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:47.940
<v Speaker 4>of people what's going down is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a dude,</v>

923
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:48.923
<v Speaker 4>this reminds me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just watched the Texas fucking </v>

924
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:51.023
<v Speaker 4>chainsaw massacre.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably like the 16th time I've </v>

925
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:56.880
<v Speaker 4>seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I watched it and like man,</v>

926
00:44:56.881 --> 00:45:01.881
<v Speaker 4>I had some very strong mentee and like I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was watching it and was like,</v>

927
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:06.120
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking unbearable.</v>

928
00:45:06.121 --> 00:45:06.954
<v Speaker 4>Like I can't deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go crazy watching this </v>

929
00:45:09.331 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the woman who by the end is all bug</v>

930
00:45:12.031 --> 00:45:12.864
<v Speaker 4>eyed and covered in blood and like she's</v>
<v Speaker 4>lost her mind because these Texas </v>

931
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.080
<v Speaker 4>fucking cannibals if like driven her and</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying I'm feeling like that.</v>

932
00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 4>But then I realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

933
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.343
<v Speaker 4>that woman running from leather face and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole family freaking out and </v>

934
00:45:26.101 --> 00:45:26.934
<v Speaker 4>screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many people are secretly that woman </v>

935
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:30.623
<v Speaker 4>inside of themselves constantly running </v>
<v Speaker 4>in terror from parts of themselves that </v>

936
00:45:35.071 --> 00:45:37.730
<v Speaker 4>they can't deal with or acknowledge or </v>
<v Speaker 4>look at.</v>

937
00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.490
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so meditation is kind of like going into</v>

938
00:45:41.491 --> 00:45:42.324
<v Speaker 4>yourself to that creepy fucking ranch </v>
<v Speaker 4>house in the middle of nowhere in your </v>

939
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:52.101
<v Speaker 4>heart and then exploring the places that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want to go into him up.</v>

940
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.220
<v Speaker 4>You know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's as it's feeling them,</v>

941
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 4>it's instead of cleaning or fixing or </v>
<v Speaker 4>repairing,</v>

942
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.900
<v Speaker 4>it's going in there and feeling the </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

943
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.350
<v Speaker 4>For a lot of people it's just grief,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pain,</v>

944
00:46:07.530 --> 00:46:09.480
<v Speaker 4>sorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>regret,</v>

945
00:46:09.481 --> 00:46:10.680
<v Speaker 4>regret,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

946
00:46:10.681 --> 00:46:12.210
<v Speaker 4>and it's going in there and not being </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

947
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.073
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fix what I fucked up seven </v>
<v Speaker 4>years ago because this is not time </v>

948
00:46:16.771 --> 00:46:17.604
<v Speaker 4>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm going to do is for 10 </v>

949
00:46:19.861 --> 00:46:21.660
<v Speaker 4>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five minutes,</v>

950
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:22.853
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to let myself feel this thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I've been trying not to feel by </v>

951
00:46:26.671 --> 00:46:31.671
<v Speaker 4>distracting myself with an incessant </v>
<v Speaker 4>flow of thoughts and that that is,</v>

952
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:33.983
<v Speaker 4>that is when you start lightening up a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit because really all you gotta </v>

953
00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.673
<v Speaker 4>do is feel as they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the maps people say feeling is </v>

954
00:46:41.731 --> 00:46:42.564
<v Speaker 4>healing.</v>

955
00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.610
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

956
00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:46.950
<v Speaker 4>but I think it have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing was like a kid show.</v>

957
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:53.150
<v Speaker 4>That's a great kid show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It shows him some good shit to do,</v>

958
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:55.140
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're on the ball.</v>

959
00:46:55.210 --> 00:46:56.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

960
00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:01.080
<v Speaker 4>You know there's some kid's movies that </v>
<v Speaker 4>are oddly psychedelic dude.</v>

961
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:01.730
<v Speaker 4>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

962
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.360
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids are psychedelic,</v>

963
00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.233
<v Speaker 4>like to appeal to a child.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you do have to create some </v>

964
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:10.673
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what kids show isn't find me a </v>

965
00:47:13.801 --> 00:47:17.880
<v Speaker 4>kid show that isn't the most psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

966
00:47:17.910 --> 00:47:19.230
<v Speaker 4>including Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rogers.</v>

967
00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 4>Like Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rogers is like,</v>

968
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:23.040
<v Speaker 4>that's some trippy shit going down </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

969
00:47:23.041 --> 00:47:23.874
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

970
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Trippy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's funny that you bring up Mr.</v>

971
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.143
<v Speaker 4>Rogers because here's what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I was going to </v>

972
00:47:28.081 --> 00:47:30.160
<v Speaker 4>say when we're talking about gun control</v>

973
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:32.740
<v Speaker 3>and violence and all the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>issues in this world,</v>

974
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.640
<v Speaker 3>what one thing that we don't concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 3>on is promoting being nicer.</v>

975
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

976
00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.090
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no government official does that.</v>

977
00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 3>Presidents don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't get on TV.</v>

978
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 3>They sort of say it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to work together,</v>

979
00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 3>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't ever say,</v>

980
00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.233
<v Speaker 3>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just got to figure out how it'd be </v>

981
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:56.290
<v Speaker 3>nice to each other like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do we not in conflict anymore,</v>

982
00:47:56.291 --> 00:48:00.990
<v Speaker 3>but we're designed for conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 3>here's how you get rid of that golf.</v>

983
00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:03.610
<v Speaker 3>Get a fucking heavy bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go Run hills,</v>

984
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.980
<v Speaker 3>go to yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat better.</v>

985
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:10.840
<v Speaker 3>Stop drinking so much coffee or alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 3>or sugar or whatever your,</v>

986
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:12.880
<v Speaker 3>your vices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking with your body.</v>

987
00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.510
<v Speaker 3>Get you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get your body in order and get your mind</v>

988
00:48:16.511 --> 00:48:18.310
<v Speaker 3>in order and just be nicer to each </v>
<v Speaker 3>other.</v>

989
00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:23.610
<v Speaker 3>That would fix almost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If people just overall decided,</v>

990
00:48:24.371 --> 00:48:25.540
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Male,</v>

991
00:48:25.541 --> 00:48:27.400
<v Speaker 3>female,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck,</v>

992
00:48:27.401 --> 00:48:30.310
<v Speaker 3>whoever you're talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just let's just be nicer to each other.</v>

993
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.061
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's just,</v>

994
00:48:31.061 --> 00:48:32.980
<v Speaker 3>everybody do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can we all just work on this?</v>

995
00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 3>No one's saying work on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's no government officials.</v>

996
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:38.620
<v Speaker 3>There's no big state of the Union </v>
<v Speaker 3>address and go,</v>

997
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:39.454
<v Speaker 3>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our problems that we have with each </v>

998
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:41.051
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

999

<v Speaker 3>We're brothers and sisters and we're all</v>

1000
00:48:44.261 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Speaker 3>immigrants.</v>

1001
00:48:46.241 --> 00:48:47.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying we should let everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1002
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:50.140
<v Speaker 3>but whoever's here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you made it bitch.</v>

1003
00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.393

<v Speaker 3>As long as you're not a God damn </v>

1004

<v Speaker 3>criminal,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and they did it through a surrogate and </v>

1017
00:49:24.821 --> 00:49:25.654

<v Speaker 3>they mixed up their ges so that no one </v>

1018

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:49:33.401 --> 00:49:34.234
<v Speaker 3>So the kids were born and they did a DNA</v>
<v Speaker 3>test on the kids cause they wanted to </v>

1023
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:42.220
<v Speaker 3>find out whether or not one of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>kids was a dirty Canadian.</v>

1024
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:43.423
<v Speaker 3>Turns out one of them is trying to sneak</v>
<v Speaker 3>over our borders at one day old fuck </v>

<v Speaker 3>Like people like jeff sessions see a </v>

1030
00:50:05.861 --> 00:50:06.694
<v Speaker 3>picture like that and they feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking at somebody taking a </v>

1031
00:50:09.491 --> 00:50:12.340
<v Speaker 3>dump on a crucifix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for a lot of these people,</v>

1032
00:50:12.341 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 3>they can't handle the idea of gay people</v>
<v Speaker 3>having kids.</v>

1033
00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.680
<v Speaker 3>It's not like they're worried about </v>
<v Speaker 3>citizenship.</v>

1034
00:50:17.890 --> 00:50:21.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like a lot of these gnarled Fox who</v>

00:54:12.451 --> 00:54:13.284
<v Speaker 4>losing their minds because like the one </v>

<v Speaker 4>Do that.</v>

1177
00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.880
<v Speaker 3>But it's on the radio or it's on TV </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather.</v>

1178
00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.020
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a gag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked it up after last night.</v>

1179
00:56:53.250 --> 00:56:54.830
<v Speaker 3>It is for sale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It a real products,</v>

1180
00:56:54.890 --> 00:56:55.600
<v Speaker 3>real products.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1181
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.120
<v Speaker 3>but so this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a comedy sketch.</v>

1182
00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.140
<v Speaker 3>I kind of knew it had to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1183
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:01.720
<v Speaker 3>There's no way it could be that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1184
00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what it is.</v>

1185
00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:04.623
<v Speaker 3>They've made a comedy sketch that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy for people like anybody who's </v>

1186
00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:09.574
<v Speaker 3>paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but for people so dumb that they don't </v>

1187
00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:14.224
<v Speaker 3>realize it's a comedy sketch and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think the way the people in the </v>

1188
00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 3>video thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.100
<v Speaker 3>It's like a honeypot for dumb dumbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:24.670
<v Speaker 3>It's brilliant because on one level it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a really funny sketch.</v>

1191
00:57:24.671 --> 00:57:27.040
<v Speaker 3>On the other level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like people like God damn,</v>

1192
00:57:27.041 --> 00:57:30.160
<v Speaker 3>I've always wanted a trumpy bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they make this bear,</v>

1193
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:31.023
<v Speaker 3>they sell this bear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pretend that they're all patriotic </v>

1194
00:57:32.891 --> 00:57:34.510
<v Speaker 3>and they just made the dump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course it is.</v>

1195
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:36.460
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am the storm.</v>

1196
00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:38.920
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was pretty sad,</v>

1197
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.960
<v Speaker 3>but this is the world we're living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

1198
00:57:40.961 --> 00:57:43.540
<v Speaker 3>I believed it was real because it is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real product,</v>

1199
00:57:43.541 --> 00:57:44.374
<v Speaker 3>but when the lady pulled out or flag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a little suspicious and then </v>

1200
00:57:47.411 --> 00:57:48.820
<v Speaker 3>the other guy says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once a marine,</v>

1201
00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:49.900
<v Speaker 3>always a marine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1202
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.240
<v Speaker 3>this is a tim and Eric Sketch.</v>

1203
00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Pretty subtle man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I like it.</v>

1204
00:57:55.801 --> 00:57:56.634
<v Speaker 4>Definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen commercials that Shitty for </v>

1205
00:57:58.621 --> 00:57:59.454
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1206
00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.240
<v Speaker 3>Trumpy bear official.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>

1207
00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:03.850
<v Speaker 3>Once Maroon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1208
00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.190
<v Speaker 3>a marine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at my boot.</v>

1209
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:06.910
<v Speaker 3>It's dirty because I work.</v>

1210
00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.700
<v Speaker 4>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

1211
00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:09.380
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1212
00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:10.200
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1213
00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.033
<v Speaker 4>we make really shitty predictions </v>
<v Speaker 4>whenever I come on your show about </v>

1214
00:58:13.081 --> 00:58:16.500
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen usually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what do you think is going to happen</v>

1215
00:58:16.501 --> 00:58:17.790
<v Speaker 4>with Mueller and trump?</v>

1216
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:22.380
<v Speaker 3>I have zero idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by the whole process.</v>

1217
00:58:22.381 --> 00:58:26.490
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by his disdain for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence intelligence community.</v>

1218
00:58:26.491 --> 00:58:30.000
<v Speaker 3>That to me seems to be like in one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the craziest things a presence ever done</v>

1219
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:31.313
<v Speaker 3>is like literally have beef with the FBI</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point where the FBI foils a </v>

1220
00:58:36.001 --> 00:58:36.834
<v Speaker 3>terrorist attack in San Francisco and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the present doesn't even mention it on </v>

1221
00:58:40.111 --> 00:58:41.520
<v Speaker 3>tv,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't praise them.</v>

1222
00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.553
<v Speaker 3>Does it make a big deal about how good </v>
<v Speaker 3>our government is that we've been able </v>

1223
00:58:45.691 --> 00:58:46.524
<v Speaker 3>to stop these terrorists?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one of the reasons why I wanted </v>

1224
00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:50.850
<v Speaker 3>to build this wall in the first place </v>
<v Speaker 3>and tighten up illegal immigration.</v>

1225
00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:51.753
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is an opportunity to prove his </v>

1226
00:58:52.261 --> 00:58:55.470
<v Speaker 3>point and he doesn't talk about it cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1227
00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:58.500
<v Speaker 3>he's got a beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got beef with the FBI.</v>

1228
00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.210
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember when the FBI agent came </v>
<v Speaker 4>to your show?</v>

1229
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:03.160
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember that when that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1230
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:07.280
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the weirdest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like really weird for me.</v>

1231
00:59:07.281 --> 00:59:08.114
<v Speaker 4>It was a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the dude like the way he did it </v>

1232
00:59:10.361 --> 00:59:13.690
<v Speaker 4>was perfect because he got like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it made my heart leap because he's like,</v>

1233
00:59:13.691 --> 00:59:14.524
<v Speaker 4>he like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he had his hand on my arm and like </v>

1234
00:59:16.691 --> 00:59:18.280
<v Speaker 4>a cop style,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1235
00:59:18.281 --> 00:59:19.114
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he like lifted his shirt up to </v>

1236
00:59:21.111 --> 00:59:23.990
<v Speaker 4>show his FBI badge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

1237
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.510
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know exactly what it was,</v>

1238
00:59:26.511 --> 00:59:27.344
<v Speaker 4>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could probably imagine a few things </v>

1239
00:59:28.311 --> 00:59:33.311
<v Speaker 4>you might be arresting me for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then he was like,</v>

1240
00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:36.650
<v Speaker 4>then he was like really cool and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1241
00:59:36.651 --> 00:59:38.270
<v Speaker 4>listen to your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1242
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.450
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

1243
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:41.510
<v Speaker 4>he was just being really awesome.</v>

1244
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:42.553
<v Speaker 8>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you need those people and everybody </v>

1245
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:44.444
<v Speaker 8>doesn't think they need those people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You have an unrealistic view of the </v>

1246
00:59:46.041 --> 00:59:47.520
<v Speaker 8>world.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You need sheep,</v>

1247
00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:49.070
<v Speaker 8>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You need them.</v>

1248
00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:50.083
<v Speaker 8>You need people to watch the criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You need two people to be able to solve </v>

1249
00:59:53.211 --> 00:59:54.044
<v Speaker 8>crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You need people to be able to stop </v>

1250
00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.430
<v Speaker 8>terrorist attacks like they did in San </v>
<v Speaker 8>Francisco.</v>

1251
00:59:58.431 --> 01:00:01.130
<v Speaker 8>You need them right and muddy dinks it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They don't need him.</v>

1252
01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:02.510
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wish we didn't need them.</v>

1253
01:00:02.511 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 8>I wish we had a perfect relationship </v>
<v Speaker 8>with all the other nations and everybody</v>

1254
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:08.840
<v Speaker 8>just decided to work together for the </v>
<v Speaker 8>survival of the species as a whole.</v>

1255
01:00:09.260 --> 01:00:12.950
<v Speaker 8>And we weren't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So concentrating on a owning resources,</v>

1256
01:00:12.951 --> 01:00:16.100
<v Speaker 8>taking over governments and controlling </v>
<v Speaker 8>parts of the world that have,</v>

1257
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.500
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>things that we're trying to steal or get</v>

1258
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:22.070
<v Speaker 8>or buy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But it is so as long as it is,</v>

1259
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:25.040
<v Speaker 8>you're going to need the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're going to need intelligence,</v>

1260
01:00:25.041 --> 01:00:26.250
<v Speaker 8>community,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're gonna need the army.</v>

1261
01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:28.640
<v Speaker 8>You didn't need the navy getting these </v>
<v Speaker 8>marines going to need the air force,</v>

1262
01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.610
<v Speaker 4>but don't the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the police,</v>

1263
01:00:30.611 --> 01:00:31.940
<v Speaker 4>the police like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Br,</v>

1264
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:33.310
<v Speaker 4>the polices bullies</v>

1265
01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:34.703
<v Speaker 8>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and there's a checks and balance system </v>

1266
01:00:36.211 --> 01:00:37.590
<v Speaker 8>that's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>

1267
01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:42.480
<v Speaker 8>I don't agree with this because I think </v>
<v Speaker 8>this is a crazy reason to fire a guy,</v>

1268
01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:45.810
<v Speaker 8>especially a guy who was a war hero,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but General Patraeus,</v>

1269
01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:46.973
<v Speaker 8>he his whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he got busted because the FBI was </v>

1270
01:00:49.141 --> 01:00:49.974
<v Speaker 8>looking into something.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The FBI was looking into something and </v>

1271
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:57.300
<v Speaker 8>got the head of the CIA in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So they go after each other.</v>

1272
01:00:57.370 --> 01:00:58.203
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So there's kind of a competitive thing </v>

1273
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:02.670
<v Speaker 8>currently heared yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>sometimes they don't get along.</v>

1274
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.713
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes the CIA and the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they don't see eye to eye on certain </v>

1275
01:01:05.911 --> 01:01:06.744
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But this one was a weird one because it </v>

1276
01:01:07.981 --> 01:01:08.814
<v Speaker 8>was about an affair.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like of all the shit that he did </v>

1277
01:01:10.651 --> 01:01:12.450
<v Speaker 8>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like he had an affair.</v>

<v Speaker 8>He didn't lunch that one.</v>

1281
01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.043
<v Speaker 8>That was after his time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they launched all kinds of crazy </v>

1282
01:01:24.451 --> 01:01:25.590
<v Speaker 8>bombs over there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

01:01:56.311 --> 01:02:00.210
<v Speaker 4>in this world that it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can only feel up for one person at a</v>

1296
01:02:00.211 --> 01:02:04.230
<v Speaker 4>time and you're definitely not going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>put that general cock and anyone else.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The guy didn't want to fuck his wife </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1302
01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 4>That's a problem</v>

1303
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 8>between them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1304

<v Speaker 8>I mean that's really where we enter into</v>

1307
01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:31.740
<v Speaker 8>the land of absurdity because this is </v>
<v Speaker 8>where it got really observe.</v>

1308
01:02:31.770 --> 01:02:32.603
<v Speaker 8>Like you know people that think that </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's some grand scheme to protect </v>

1309
01:02:35.011 --> 01:02:37.980
<v Speaker 8>people and protect generals.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A dude,</v>

1310
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:41.340
<v Speaker 8>there's video of him when he was walking</v>
<v Speaker 8>from city college in New York where he's</v>

1311
01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.174
<v Speaker 8>teaching and he'd have to walk down the </v>
<v Speaker 8>street where he was going and the </v>

1312
01:02:44.521 --> 01:02:47.850
<v Speaker 8>students were surrounding him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>screaming at him,</v>

1313
01:02:47.851 --> 01:02:51.360
<v Speaker 8>calling him a war criminal and he did it</v>
<v Speaker 8>constantly is teaching there.</v>

1314
01:02:51.570 --> 01:02:53.580
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Follow him from and he,</v>

1315
01:02:53.581 --> 01:02:54.414
<v Speaker 8>and they're filming us for the cash of </v>
<v Speaker 8>the cameras are filming them and then </v>

1316
01:02:56.221 --> 01:02:57.930
<v Speaker 8>people around him like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck you,</v>

1317
01:02:58.460 --> 01:02:59.293
<v Speaker 8>cute.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And he's,</v>

1318
01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.290
<v Speaker 8>he's on his own dude.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's helpless.</v>

1319
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.240
<v Speaker 8>If somebody just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they just jump them.</v>

1320
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.950
<v Speaker 8>They just jumped him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No one's stopping them.</v>

1321
01:03:04.951 --> 01:03:08.910
<v Speaker 8>I thought people like that had like </v>
<v Speaker 8>internal guards or something.</v>

1322
01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.960
<v Speaker 8>Turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 8>nope.</v>

1323
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:11.310
<v Speaker 8>Turns out,</v>
<v Speaker 8>nope.</v>

1324
01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:13.620
<v Speaker 8>No Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cast that guy aside.</v>

1325
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:14.993
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know if they've rectified the </v>

1326
01:03:15.601 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 8>situation after that day,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that day he is by himself.</v>

1327
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:20.280
<v Speaker 8>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Turn it up.</v>

1328
01:03:20.281 --> 01:03:21.720
<v Speaker 8>Give you some volume on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is crazy.</v>

1329
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:32.650
<v Speaker 10>It's crazy blood all over.</v>

1330
01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:40.003
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this hyperboles not necessarily holy </v>

1331
01:03:41.481 --> 01:03:42.314
<v Speaker 8>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's crazy to imagine that guy sexting </v>

1332
01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:47.620
<v Speaker 8>sucks the fuck out at some lady.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ooh.</v>

1333
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.740
<v Speaker 8>Like a missile son at home.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Here's a bunker buster.</v>

1334
01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:55.210
<v Speaker 8>When he comes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he whispers scenario.</v>

1335
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:56.910
<v Speaker 10>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Ooh,</v>

1336
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:59.470
<v Speaker 10>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 10>Ooh.</v>

1337
01:03:59.650 --> 01:04:04.650
<v Speaker 8>It curls up back man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let her see.</v>

1338
01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:07.103
<v Speaker 10>Hmm.</v>

1339
01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.530
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they leave,</v>

1340
01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:12.810
<v Speaker 8>but they left a guy alone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what's interesting.</v>

1341
01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:16.020
<v Speaker 8>Then you would think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the amount of influence that guy had,</v>

1342
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.741
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the,</v>

1343
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:18.930
<v Speaker 8>I mean that guy was one of the top </v>
<v Speaker 8>generals,</v>

1344
01:04:18.931 --> 01:04:20.760
<v Speaker 8>if not the top general in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1345
01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.223
<v Speaker 8>Wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

1346
01:04:22.770 --> 01:04:23.603
<v Speaker 8>I mean he was a huge war hero.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's been two instances of shit like </v>

1347
01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:28.500
<v Speaker 8>that happening.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Where,</v>

1348
01:04:28.501 --> 01:04:29.334
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the other one was the Michael Hastings </v>

1349
01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:31.170
<v Speaker 8>one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you remember that one?</v>

1350
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.260
<v Speaker 8>Vaguely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a fascinating one.</v>

1351
01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:36.570
<v Speaker 8>If you really want to fire up your </v>
<v Speaker 8>conspiracy theory,</v>

1352
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:42.330
<v Speaker 8>really want to turn a pitch tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Michael Hastings was a journalist who,</v>

1353
01:04:42.331 --> 01:04:43.740
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>was embedded,</v>

1354
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.710
<v Speaker 8>I believe it was in Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It might've been an Afghanistan,</v>

1355
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.620
<v Speaker 8>but he was a embedded in the Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 8>somewhere.</v>

1356
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.330
<v Speaker 8>And,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1357
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:53.010
<v Speaker 8>something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

1358
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:56.070
<v Speaker 8>that volcano erupted.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Remember when that volcano erupted?</v>

1359
01:04:56.071 --> 01:04:58.860
<v Speaker 8>And they canceled all air flight for a </v>
<v Speaker 8>long time.</v>

1360
01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:03.570
<v Speaker 8>He was trapped over there with that and </v>
<v Speaker 8>they got way too comfortable with him.</v>

1361
01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.480
<v Speaker 8>And so they started talking around this </v>
<v Speaker 8>journalist,</v>

1362
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:09.960
<v Speaker 8>the way they always talk and they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and he was joking around about Obama and</v>

1363
01:05:09.961 --> 01:05:10.794
<v Speaker 8>make it fun of Obama and they said a </v>
<v Speaker 8>bunch of shit they probably shouldn't </v>

1364
01:05:13.411 --> 01:05:14.244
<v Speaker 8>have said,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that just what fucking soldiers say </v>

1365
01:05:15.751 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 8>when they're over there risking their </v>
<v Speaker 8>lights or something,</v>

1366
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.843
<v Speaker 2>they probably don't even understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would want them to believe this is </v>

1367
01:05:20.741 --> 01:05:21.850
<v Speaker 2>all for a good cost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1368
01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:22.713
<v Speaker 2>You would want them to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that they're general tells </v>

1369
01:05:24.521 --> 01:05:26.770
<v Speaker 2>them if they got a fucking crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some jokes,</v>

1370
01:05:26.771 --> 01:05:27.604
<v Speaker 2>the president's expense to alleviate a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little stress while we're out there </v>

1371
01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:31.360
<v Speaker 2>killing strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1372
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:34.210
<v Speaker 2>no UN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intolerable,</v>

1373
01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.133
<v Speaker 2>intolerable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mocking the leader of the free world </v>

1374
01:05:37.811 --> 01:05:39.220
<v Speaker 2>while you're out there killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>strangers,</v>

1375
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:41.770
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he made this guy resigned.</v>

1376
01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:42.663
<v Speaker 2>So here's where it gets crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Hastings starts telling </v>

1377
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:46.331
<v Speaker 2>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1378
01:05:46.331 --> 01:05:48.280
<v Speaker 2>my life is in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1379
01:05:48.281 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 2>people are threatening my life on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>daily basis.</v>

1380
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:51.003
<v Speaker 2>If anything happens to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not commit suicide cut to him </v>

1381
01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:55.713
<v Speaker 2>driving down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was sunset car going </v>

1382
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:01.000
<v Speaker 2>uncontrollably fast slamming into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>

1383
01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:05.080
<v Speaker 2>The car exploding the engine flying from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car.</v>

1384
01:06:05.081 --> 01:06:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's dead as fuck.</v>

1385
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.163
<v Speaker 2>They find amphetamines in his system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's adderall because that's what </v>

1386
01:06:10.571 --> 01:06:12.820
<v Speaker 2>all journalists are on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All on adderall.</v>

1387
01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they tried it all the,</v>

1388
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I was on methamphetamines when he drove </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a tree case salts.</v>

1389
01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.020
<v Speaker 2>Classic job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick Tracy.</v>

1390
01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just forget about it.</v>

1391
01:06:21.671 --> 01:06:23.680
<v Speaker 2>We connected the dots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was quite easy.</v>

1392
01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:24.933
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that have said with </v>

1393
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:29.650
<v Speaker 2>absolute certainty that with today's </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>

1394
01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:30.603
<v Speaker 2>it is incredibly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely credibly possible to control </v>

1395
01:06:36.581 --> 01:06:41.230
<v Speaker 2>the car from a remote place and make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car do what you want it,</v>

1396
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:43.160
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>

1397
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:44.210
<v Speaker 4>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely,</v>

1398
01:06:44.211 --> 01:06:45.530
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we,</v>

1399
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:49.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love this line of this direction we're</v>

1400
01:06:49.101 --> 01:06:50.690
<v Speaker 4>going in here man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because you,</v>

1401
01:06:51.110 --> 01:06:54.360
<v Speaker 4>it's great because it's like this to me </v>
<v Speaker 4>where it gets really,</v>

1402
01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:57.830
<v Speaker 4>remember that thing that people would </v>
<v Speaker 4>always say that government is always,</v>

1403
01:06:57.831 --> 01:07:00.020
<v Speaker 4>what is it five years ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven years ahead.</v>

1404
01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:05.740
<v Speaker 2>I have it tattooed on my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you get it at a nightclub in Berlin?</v>

1405
01:07:08.001 --> 01:07:09.800
<v Speaker 2>You got to know the government's ahead </v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

1406
01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's true.</v>

1407
01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:13.540
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that money that they have.</v>

1408
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:14.523
<v Speaker 4>So where where it gets really </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting is when you start thinking </v>

1409
01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:18.814
<v Speaker 4>about what that means in relation to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like computer intelligence and ai and </v>

1410
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:27.160
<v Speaker 4>you start realizing like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1411
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:32.080
<v Speaker 4>whatever the shit is that they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>access to at this point compared to what</v>

1412
01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:32.914
<v Speaker 4>we think they have access to is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerful and so dangerous that anybody </v>

1413
01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:43.600
<v Speaker 4>who they want to take out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody they want to take out,</v>

1414
01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.940
<v Speaker 4>they can take out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a problem.</v>

1415
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:46.890
<v Speaker 4>It's okay.</v>

1416
01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:49.440
<v Speaker 2>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having anybody to have that much power,</v>

1417
01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:52.110
<v Speaker 2>especially over the rest of us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bad for them.</v>

1418
01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:52.973
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Kennedy talked about this when he </v>

1419
01:07:53.821 --> 01:07:54.654
<v Speaker 2>was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks about secret societies and and </v>

1420
01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:59.790
<v Speaker 2>keeping secrets from people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just generally,</v>

1421
01:07:59.791 --> 01:08:02.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad idea across the board for </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>

1422
01:08:02.161 --> 01:08:04.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just bad for our human nature and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1423
01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.180
<v Speaker 2>for groups to have ultimate power of </v>
<v Speaker 2>surveillance.</v>

1424
01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.550
<v Speaker 2>It would just look into your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's odd.</v>

1425
01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edward Snowden proved it.</v>

1426
01:08:09.901 --> 01:08:10.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's obviously,</v>

1427
01:08:10.861 --> 01:08:13.020
<v Speaker 2>it's too easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too easy for people that work there</v>

1428
01:08:13.021 --> 01:08:14.940
<v Speaker 2>to check on the ex girlfriends who the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking up.</v>

1429
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.100
<v Speaker 2>I just have one to read your email.</v>

1430
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.963
<v Speaker 4>Do you think there is secret societies </v>
<v Speaker 4>out there that we're not really aware </v>

1431
01:08:19.941 --> 01:08:21.890
<v Speaker 4>of?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1432
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.720
<v Speaker 4>if they're secret societies that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of,</v>

1433
01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:26.630
<v Speaker 4>that's because someone along the line </v>
<v Speaker 4>open their fucking trap.</v>

1434
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.553
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they let us know about a secret </v>

1435
01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:29.804
<v Speaker 4>society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how we found out about skull and </v>

1436
01:08:30.621 --> 01:08:31.454
<v Speaker 4>bones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1437
01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.440
<v Speaker 4>One of those posts he's told their mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1438
01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:35.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you made me sweat.</v>

1439
01:08:35.131 --> 01:08:36.110
<v Speaker 4>Could dig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they filmed.</v>

1440
01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.250
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1441
01:08:37.251 --> 01:08:38.084
<v Speaker 4>I'm in the order.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it like a glass coffin like glass </v>

1442
01:08:40.371 --> 01:08:42.950
<v Speaker 4>Dick Saca glass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>second glass Dick.</v>

1443
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:43.880
<v Speaker 4>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no way.</v>

1444
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:47.330
<v Speaker 4>Not your way in a glass cottage is on </v>
<v Speaker 4>you and they just on the glass,</v>

1445
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:48.193
<v Speaker 4>like you're laying down and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking up their glass coffin and it's </v>

1446
01:08:51.081 --> 01:08:51.914
<v Speaker 4>raining jets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if you do that to a guy and it </v>

1447
01:08:53.861 --> 01:08:57.110
<v Speaker 4>becomes uncontrolled?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Hard and just shoots in his pants?</v>

1448
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.903
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're naked in the glass </v>

1449
01:08:59.451 --> 01:09:00.350
<v Speaker 4>coffin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1450
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:01.423
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they like put you in </v>

1451
01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:05.120
<v Speaker 4>funeral garb or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my guess is like,</v>

1452
01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:06.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>

1453
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:07.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to,</v>

1454
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:07.873
<v Speaker 4>I prefer to be naked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to fucking splattered all </v>

1455
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:12.480
<v Speaker 4>over this fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want you to be weirded out.</v>

1456
01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Let's go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1457
01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:20.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to lay down face first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just stare at my area.</v>

1458
01:09:20.121 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 4>I'll try to come on the coffin from </v>
<v Speaker 4>inside.</v>

1459
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:27.260
<v Speaker 4>Come on it from the APP while singing </v>
<v Speaker 4>Abba songs.</v>

1460
01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.020
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do you ever like,</v>

1461
01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:35.350
<v Speaker 4>I love thinking about this stuff because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that there is probably,</v>

1462
01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:40.520
<v Speaker 4>and this is kind of what we talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about a little bit before where the maps</v>

1463
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:41.383
<v Speaker 4>don't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people like to live in </v>

1464
01:09:44.691 --> 01:09:47.720
<v Speaker 4>a place where there's maps and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine that's all there is,</v>

1465
01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:49.003
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pretty sure that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>sectors of society that you just never </v>

1466
01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:59.240
<v Speaker 4>see and you never will see because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>have around them.</v>

1467
01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:00.074
<v Speaker 4>This impermeable wall of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're not going to get in there </v>

1468
01:10:03.471 --> 01:10:08.471
<v Speaker 4>like places that have membership fees </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are like $600,000</v>

1469
01:10:09.201 --> 01:10:10.970
<v Speaker 4>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like yeah,</v>

1470
01:10:10.971 --> 01:10:13.670
<v Speaker 4>I know a guy lives in one of those uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gated communities.</v>

1471
01:10:13.670 --> 01:10:17.750
<v Speaker 4>It has a golf course and the golf course</v>
<v Speaker 4>costs a quarter million dollars a year.</v>

1472
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:21.410
<v Speaker 4>That because that creates this wall </v>
<v Speaker 4>where most people Gannett get into.</v>

1473
01:10:21.411 --> 01:10:25.040
<v Speaker 4>And then also that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are living in compounds.</v>

1474
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:30.080
<v Speaker 4>People are living in massive compounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have entire teams of servants.</v>

1475
01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.340
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

1476
01:10:31.341 --> 01:10:35.030
<v Speaker 4>there's people who have eight nannies </v>
<v Speaker 4>for their baby.</v>

1477
01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.770
<v Speaker 4>Did you know that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's people who have,</v>

1478
01:10:36.771 --> 01:10:39.470
<v Speaker 4>it's because they're poor and they can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>afford 15 like a normal family.</v>

1479
01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.513
<v Speaker 4>Teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got all the different languages </v>

1480
01:10:43.191 --> 01:10:44.024
<v Speaker 4>covered,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the different styles you could have </v>

1481
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:47.660
<v Speaker 4>gained any straight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Danny sees the kid likes.</v>

1482
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:48.523
<v Speaker 4>But that's when you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there they're these enclaves of </v>

1483
01:10:51.741 --> 01:10:56.741
<v Speaker 4>wealth that are compounds surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 4>not just like financial walls,</v>

1484
01:10:56.931 --> 01:11:01.310
<v Speaker 4>but literal walls with armed guards </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing around the walls.</v>

1485
01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:04.390
<v Speaker 4>And inside these compounds are </v>
<v Speaker 4>communities of,</v>

1486
01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:05.463
<v Speaker 4>of a servant class there communities of </v>
<v Speaker 4>servants that are having to serve these </v>

1487
01:11:10.341 --> 01:11:12.440
<v Speaker 4>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hyper wealthy people.</v>

1488
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:13.483
<v Speaker 4>That's a king and a queen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a futile compound that's being </v>

1489
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.813
<v Speaker 4>separated from the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're at least to duke and the </v>

1490
01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:22.850
<v Speaker 4>Duchess of Duke and the Duchess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean the pr,</v>

1491
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.980
<v Speaker 4>it's basically the no different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1492
01:11:26.230 --> 01:11:27.063
<v Speaker 4>it's the same fucking thing because a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of the people working in there are </v>

1493
01:11:30.330 --> 01:11:31.163
<v Speaker 4>illegals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they don't even have recourse to </v>

1494
01:11:32.911 --> 01:11:33.744
<v Speaker 4>normal laws and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so what ends up happening in these </v>

1495
01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:40.530
<v Speaker 4>compounds is there's people who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>untraceable who live in there.</v>

1496
01:11:40.531 --> 01:11:43.770

<v Speaker 3>Scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's him coming and it's like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what it's like.</v>

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:36.870
<v Speaker 3>It's fat like that terrifying and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>end of it,</v>

1721
01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:41.930
<v Speaker 3>it quivers terrible seats like the demo </v>
<v Speaker 3>gorgons mouth on stranger things.</v>

1722

<v Speaker 3>It has like a little flower thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the very end.</v>

1724
01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:48.203
<v Speaker 3>Every time we do an episode together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we end up describing some form of alien </v>

1725
01:21:51.901 --> 01:21:54.030
<v Speaker 3>caulk every single time.</v>

1726
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.863
<v Speaker 3>Like I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the last one we added a </v>

<v Speaker 8>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

1833
01:26:06.681 --> 01:26:07.514
<v Speaker 8>because I'm not like you got dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Plus I don't keep those Cami ideas </v>

1834
01:26:10.071 --> 01:26:13.370
<v Speaker 8>floating around inside my head.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got a Goddamn American flag behind me.</v>

1835
01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:15.530
<v Speaker 8>Gun Control.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The fuck you're talking about.</v>

1836
01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:16.513
<v Speaker 8>I'm friends with a ton of cops.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You got an American flag with a fucking </v>

1837
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.713
<v Speaker 8>cow's skull above it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's actually an Asian buffalo from </v>

1838
01:26:24.111 --> 01:26:24.944
<v Speaker 8>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was arrowed by my great friend </v>

1839
01:26:26.181 --> 01:26:27.370
<v Speaker 8>Adam Green Tree.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

1840
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:30.800
<v Speaker 8>One of the best bow hunters on the face </v>
<v Speaker 8>of the planet earth.</v>

1841
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:32.450
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He shot that thing.</v>

1842
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:33.643
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I mean it's like brought it to me </v>

1843
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:37.040
<v Speaker 8>remembering my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 8>remember when we did that show,</v>

1844
01:26:37.670 --> 01:26:41.620
<v Speaker 8>I remember we did that at this but it </v>
<v Speaker 8>was kind of we is it.</v>

1845
01:26:41.630 --> 01:26:46.430
<v Speaker 8>As the show progressed we became </v>
<v Speaker 8>increasingly sort of despondent and find</v>

1846
01:26:46.431 --> 01:26:50.300
<v Speaker 8>realizing cause we're both retired.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tell him that we here,</v>

1847
01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.160
<v Speaker 8>maybe we were going to find an alien.</v>

1848
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:53.683
<v Speaker 8>Like both of us secretly thought.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It became very frustrating because you </v>

1849
01:26:56.681 --> 01:26:57.514
<v Speaker 8>saw the same thing and everybody you saw</v>
<v Speaker 8>this delusional belief in a logical </v>

1850
01:27:01.101 --> 01:27:06.101
<v Speaker 8>things that they would argue.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They would argue illogically the,</v>

1851
01:27:06.231 --> 01:27:07.064
<v Speaker 8>there weren't objective about the actual</v>
<v Speaker 8>evidence versus what they wanted to </v>

1852
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.843
<v Speaker 8>perceive the evidence to point to there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're all biased in which I've been </v>

1853
01:27:13.791 --> 01:27:15.650
<v Speaker 8>biased before.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everyone has been biased but it was just</v>

1854
01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.030
<v Speaker 8>delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everything.</v>

1855
01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:17.893
<v Speaker 8>Everyone was delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everyone from the first Ufo guy to the </v>

1856
01:27:20.691 --> 01:27:23.570
<v Speaker 8>first chem trail got to the first big </v>
<v Speaker 8>foot guy.</v>

1857
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:27.980
<v Speaker 8>They were all either liars or delusional</v>
<v Speaker 8>or they had errors in their thinking.</v>

1858
01:27:28.190 --> 01:27:29.023
<v Speaker 8>And then occasionally we would talk to a</v>
<v Speaker 8>guy like that one dude that we met that </v>

1859
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:32.384
<v Speaker 8>was in the trailer that told us about </v>
<v Speaker 8>the balls that would fly through the </v>

1860
01:27:34.071 --> 01:27:34.904
<v Speaker 8>air.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

1861
01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.013
<v Speaker 8>Well after that I heard a podcast with a</v>
<v Speaker 8>physicist who a guy was a lightening </v>

1862
01:27:41.211 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 8>expert who was talking about ball </v>
<v Speaker 8>lightning.</v>

1863
01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:46.400
<v Speaker 8>They don't know what causes it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1864
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:47.323
<v Speaker 8>They don't know why it exists even.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And this guy was that it was on radio </v>

1865
01:27:51.261 --> 01:27:52.094
<v Speaker 8>lab and it was fairly recently,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and this guy was actually saying that </v>

1866
01:27:54.321 --> 01:27:56.350
<v Speaker 8>lightning itself,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

1867
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:59.360
<v Speaker 8>doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like it's not supposed to exist.</v>

1868
01:27:59.361 --> 01:28:00.194
<v Speaker 8>If you're measuring all of the energy in</v>
<v Speaker 8>the skype is something that we don't </v>

1869
01:28:02.511 --> 01:28:04.610
<v Speaker 8>know about what the formation of </v>
<v Speaker 8>lightening is,</v>

1870
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.620
<v Speaker 8>that it shouldn't even exist.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Shouldn't be possible.</v>

1871
01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:07.483
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But this ball lightning is not only </v>

1872
01:28:08.871 --> 01:28:11.060
<v Speaker 8>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's been observed many,</v>

1873
01:28:11.061 --> 01:28:14.450
<v Speaker 8>many times and it's even happened inside</v>
<v Speaker 8>of an airplane.</v>

1874
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:19.010
<v Speaker 8>What floated down the aisle inside of an</v>
<v Speaker 8>airplane and multiple people witnessed.</v>

1875
01:28:19.400 --> 01:28:22.550
<v Speaker 8>People have seen ball lightning,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they've gotten video of bald lightning.</v>

1876
01:28:22.730 --> 01:28:23.563
<v Speaker 8>And what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is that exactly what that guy was </v>

1877
01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:25.874
<v Speaker 8>describing to us that this thing came </v>
<v Speaker 8>through his house and then just </v>

1878
01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:29.600
<v Speaker 8>disappeared?</v>

1879
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.433
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Remember he's talking about totally </v>

1880
01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:34.130
<v Speaker 8>remember and he did not seem like a liar</v>
<v Speaker 8>to me now.</v>

1881
01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:35.173
<v Speaker 8>I think he saw ball lightning and I </v>
<v Speaker 8>think that area knew that skin Walker </v>

1882
01:28:38.751 --> 01:28:41.420
<v Speaker 8>ranch place in particular is for </v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever,</v>

1883
01:28:41.421 --> 01:28:45.950
<v Speaker 8>whatever causes that phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It happens more frequently in that area.</v>

1884
01:28:45.980 --> 01:28:46.813
<v Speaker 8>It's very possible because there are a </v>
<v Speaker 8>lot of people over there that saw some </v>

1885
01:28:48.651 --> 01:28:49.640
<v Speaker 8>shit share,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

1886
01:28:49.641 --> 01:28:50.080
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>

1887
01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:53.210
<v Speaker 8>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that was disappointing,</v>

1888
01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:56.390
<v Speaker 8>but that was the most revealing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was revealing in the guy.</v>

1889
01:28:56.391 --> 01:28:57.990
<v Speaker 8>That was a weird area.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1890
01:28:58.010 --> 01:28:59.690
<v Speaker 8>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was a fucking weird area.</v>

1891
01:28:59.750 --> 01:29:01.560
<v Speaker 8>But don't you like</v>

1892
01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:05.580
<v Speaker 4>imagine that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever do this game?</v>

1893
01:29:05.670 --> 01:29:06.503
<v Speaker 4>There's a fun game or you start thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about who the smartest person on the </v>

1894
01:29:08.701 --> 01:29:09.534
<v Speaker 4>planet must be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the continuum of intelligence game </v>

1895
01:29:11.731 --> 01:29:12.990
<v Speaker 4>where you start thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1896
01:29:13.290 --> 01:29:15.570
<v Speaker 4>I know I land somewhere on the continuum</v>
<v Speaker 4>of intelligence.</v>

1897
01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:16.913
<v Speaker 4>I know there's people that are probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>not quite as smart as I am and I know </v>

1898
01:29:19.591 --> 01:29:21.870
<v Speaker 4>there's people who are way fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>smarter than I am.</v>

1899
01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.150
<v Speaker 4>And then you start thinking of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are the,</v>

1900
01:29:24.151 --> 01:29:27.270
<v Speaker 4>who are those people and what and what </v>
<v Speaker 4>are they up to?</v>

1901
01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:29.010
<v Speaker 4>And then you start thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>see,</v>

1902
01:29:29.011 --> 01:29:30.420
<v Speaker 4>this is what I think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I were you.</v>

1903
01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:32.610
<v Speaker 4>Then you start thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck man,</v>

1904
01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I've got this podcast that lots of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people listen to.</v>

1905
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.273
<v Speaker 4>Is it ever happened where maybe some </v>
<v Speaker 4>really intelligent person has </v>

1906
01:29:41.671 --> 01:29:42.504
<v Speaker 4>manipulated me and an attempt to get me </v>
<v Speaker 4>to disseminate some kind of information </v>

1907
01:29:45.391 --> 01:29:46.440
<v Speaker 4>out into the world.</v>

1908
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.330
<v Speaker 4>Good luck manipulating me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Duncan Trussell,</v>

1909
01:29:48.331 --> 01:29:51.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm an American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Flags don't run or something.</v>

1910
01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:56.370
<v Speaker 4>What happens is colors at least know </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's up,</v>

1911
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:58.110
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you wouldn't even know.</v>

1912
01:29:58.111 --> 01:29:59.790
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing you wouldn't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't know.</v>

1913
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:00.624
<v Speaker 4>How would I not know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people are people we're not going </v>

1914
01:30:02.161 --> 01:30:02.994
<v Speaker 4>to be like if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone is super so good at </v>

1915
01:30:04.741 --> 01:30:08.370
<v Speaker 4>manipulating people that can manipulate </v>
<v Speaker 4>me and it changed the way or think about</v>

1916
01:30:08.371 --> 01:30:09.204
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1917
01:30:09.690 --> 01:30:11.550
<v Speaker 4>well then good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1918
01:30:11.551 --> 01:30:12.384
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's like the thing is like this </v>

1919
01:30:13.561 --> 01:30:14.011
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1920
01:30:14.011 --> 01:30:15.580
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to make you paranoid or </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

1921
01:30:15.581 --> 01:30:16.620
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just,</v>

1922
01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.710
<v Speaker 4>but it's fun to think cause it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this like,</v>

1923
01:30:19.890 --> 01:30:20.723
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like let's imagine for the sake of just </v>

1924
01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:23.994
<v Speaker 4>fun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we established there these fucking </v>

1925
01:30:25.831 --> 01:30:28.440
<v Speaker 4>billionaires and they live in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>compounds and they,</v>

1926
01:30:28.710 --> 01:30:31.580
<v Speaker 4>and we've also established that </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly people like mice thing,</v>

1927
01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:34.340
<v Speaker 4>Michael Hastings and other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get killed all the time.</v>

1928
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:35.183
<v Speaker 4>Might have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think you got killed because he </v>

1929
01:30:36.451 --> 01:30:39.650
<v Speaker 4>got a fucking major general fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they what?</v>

1930
01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:41.910
<v Speaker 4>What did we establish their general </v>
<v Speaker 4>during,</v>

1931
01:30:41.980 --> 01:30:42.813
<v Speaker 4>they're super powerful people who will </v>
<v Speaker 4>use technology to kill people to have </v>

1932
01:30:45.691 --> 01:30:46.524
<v Speaker 4>their own way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that means that there is some group </v>

1933
01:30:48.721 --> 01:30:49.554
<v Speaker 4>or a series of groups of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>you doing or like highly nefarious </v>

1934
01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:56.460
<v Speaker 4>actions from a place of power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just paranoid.</v>

1935
01:30:56.670 --> 01:30:57.503
<v Speaker 4>Or you're not connecting the dots here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he was on speed and drove into a </v>

1936
01:30:59.521 --> 01:31:01.860
<v Speaker 4>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the honestly I do not know.</v>

1937
01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:03.330
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his very fun.</v>

1938
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:06.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To think that it's a conspiracy and they</v>

1939
01:31:06.451 --> 01:31:07.440
<v Speaker 4>killed him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very Fun.</v>

1940
01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:11.820
<v Speaker 4>But if you look at Ockham's razor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know if you applied ockham's razor,</v>

1941
01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:15.880
<v Speaker 4>the most likely scenario is that he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>drove into a tree that's not very sexy.</v>

1942
01:31:15.881 --> 01:31:16.714
<v Speaker 4>Here is a way to kind of help out with </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ockham's razor with these kinds of </v>

1943
01:31:21.301 --> 01:31:21.570
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

1944
01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:22.890
<v Speaker 4>It's just think,</v>

1965
01:32:14.981 --> 01:32:17.950
<v Speaker 8>fucking radar man?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because like the thing is like if there,</v>

1966
01:32:17.951 --> 01:32:21.490
<v Speaker 8>if there is an interest in controlling </v>
<v Speaker 8>the pair and the reality tunnel,</v>

1967
01:32:21.491 --> 01:32:22.324
<v Speaker 8>like we know that there is a Wa like </v>
<v Speaker 8>truly a award to control the paradigm </v>

1968
01:32:29.860 --> 01:32:32.860
<v Speaker 8>because if I can control the paradigm </v>
<v Speaker 8>just as a cool thing,</v>

1969
01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.150
<v Speaker 8>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I agree with you,</v>

1970
01:32:34.151 --> 01:32:37.900
<v Speaker 8>but I don't think it's a united front.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This war to control the paradigm is most</v>

1971
01:32:38.110 --> 01:32:41.600
<v Speaker 8>tightly fought between left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's most tightly fought in,</v>

1972
01:32:41.601 --> 01:32:42.434
<v Speaker 8>in government.</v>

1973
01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:43.900
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>In the real things.</v>

1974
01:32:44.230 --> 01:32:46.600
<v Speaker 8>Well we're doing is commentating on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>sidelines.</v>

1975
01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:47.410
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

1976
01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:48.243
<v Speaker 8>if I'm an influencing anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm influencing people by pointing them </v>

1977
01:32:51.041 --> 01:32:53.530
<v Speaker 8>to information that I see that's already</v>
<v Speaker 8>out there.</v>

1978
01:32:53.980 --> 01:32:58.980
<v Speaker 8>There's a big difference between these </v>
<v Speaker 8>people are in power against each other,</v>

1979
01:32:59.230 --> 01:33:00.063
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's gotta be some people that are </v>

1980
01:33:01.121 --> 01:33:04.660
<v Speaker 8>influencers that get access or get shit </v>
<v Speaker 8>upon,</v>

1981
01:33:04.661 --> 01:33:07.060
<v Speaker 8>especially in the age of trump,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like if you're an antitrust and me,</v>

1982
01:33:07.061 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 8>if he finds out you're against him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's got like,</v>

1983
01:33:09.611 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 8>he's very vindictive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like he calls don lemon a moron,</v>

1984
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:15.940
<v Speaker 8>and he shits all over those CNN host and</v>
<v Speaker 8>call CNN fake news.</v>

1985
01:33:15.941 --> 01:33:19.990
<v Speaker 8>But Sean Hannity and Fox and friends,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he'll praise them in his tweets.</v>

1986
01:33:19.991 --> 01:33:22.450
<v Speaker 8>Like there's an information war going on</v>
<v Speaker 8>with these people,</v>

1987
01:33:22.451 --> 01:33:27.130
<v Speaker 8>but they're paying attention to right </v>
<v Speaker 8>and left assholes like me that are like,</v>

1988
01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:27.620

1994
01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.130
<v Speaker 8>I like his ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He,</v>

1995
01:33:37.131 --> 01:33:37.964
<v Speaker 8>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he was a guy that when he was running </v>

1996

<v Speaker 8>person.</v>

1999
01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.210
<v Speaker 8>He's clearly a very honest person.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

2000
01:33:46.211 --> 01:33:48.400
<v Speaker 8>by all accounts.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Let's see what he does,</v>

2002
01:33:50.270 --> 01:33:51.430
<v Speaker 8>what happens.</v>

<v Speaker 3>real lesson here to learn,</v>

2083
01:37:28.930 --> 01:37:32.200
<v Speaker 3>but if there's more than 10 to one men </v>

2088
01:37:41.951 --> 01:37:43.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ratio of men,</v>

2089
01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.610
<v Speaker 3>women or is the ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's take a guess.</v>

2090
01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.680
<v Speaker 3>What is the ratio of men to women in </v>
<v Speaker 3>China?</v>

2091
01:37:47.681 --> 01:37:49.930
<v Speaker 3>I meant like 60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40.</v>

2092
01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:52.480
<v Speaker 3>It might be bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be higher.</v>

2093
01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:54.100
<v Speaker 3>That's danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Might've made that up.</v>

2094
01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:55.300
<v Speaker 3>That's a dangerous,</v>

2095
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a spooky ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've read the ratio.</v>

2096
01:37:58.111 --> 01:38:00.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not a good ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spooky fucked up ratio.</v>

2097
01:38:01.050 --> 01:38:01.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2098
01:38:01.381 --> 01:38:03.930
<v Speaker 2>for the long time they had limitations </v>
<v Speaker 2>on how many children you can have,</v>

2099
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:07.830
<v Speaker 2>which is just fucking take gen x.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They messed up the whole thing.</v>

2100
01:38:07.831 --> 01:38:08.664
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were killing their baby if they </v>

2101
01:38:11.041 --> 01:38:12.930
<v Speaker 2>found their baby was a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2102
01:38:12.931 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 2>this is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't happen everywhere.</v>

2103
01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:16.313
<v Speaker 2>It didn't happen all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there absolutely were girls that </v>

2104
01:38:18.571 --> 01:38:19.404
<v Speaker 2>were drowned because they were girls </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the family wanted a boy and if </v>

2105
01:38:21.751 --> 01:38:24.690
<v Speaker 2>you don't think that that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're delusional.</v>

2106
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:25.583
<v Speaker 2>I think you're delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if you put those kind of </v>

2107
01:38:26.851 --> 01:38:30.930
<v Speaker 2>restrictions on intensely poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some of them,</v>

2108
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:34.320
<v Speaker 2>in some parts of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in terrible poverty and you tell</v>

2109
01:38:34.321 --> 01:38:35.520
<v Speaker 2>them they can only have one kid.</v>

2110
01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:38.190
<v Speaker 2>They don't want to have a boy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the boy is going to help them work.</v>

2111
01:38:38.430 --> 01:38:39.263
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if these stories of them </v>

2112
01:38:40.741 --> 01:38:43.230
<v Speaker 2>drowning baby girls were true because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't there.</v>

2113
01:38:43.710 --> 01:38:46.740
<v Speaker 2>Those stories persist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sherry ever snope them,</v>

2114
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.260
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think they know either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you weren't there,</v>

2115
01:38:49.261 --> 01:38:50.640
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>

2116
01:38:50.670 --> 01:38:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a horrible thing to think to have a</v>

2117
01:38:52.861 --> 01:38:54.640
<v Speaker 2>baby and then just drowning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

2118
01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.180
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have a deck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but two people have done that.</v>

2119
01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:58.860
<v Speaker 2>People have left babies and garbage </v>
<v Speaker 2>cans.</v>

2120
01:38:58.861 --> 01:39:01.230
<v Speaker 2>I mean people have done a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible things to babies.</v>

2121
01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:03.300
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2122
01:39:03.301 --> 01:39:04.134
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked at a place called Newport </v>

2123
01:39:05.490 --> 01:39:06.323
<v Speaker 2>creamery and it was right next to a bank</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a girl that worked in the bank was </v>

2124
01:39:09.541 --> 01:39:11.610
<v Speaker 2>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She never told anybody she was pregnant.</v>

2125
01:39:11.820 --> 01:39:15.000
<v Speaker 2>She gave birth in the toilet and left </v>
<v Speaker 2>the baby in the garbage.</v>

2126
01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.460
<v Speaker 2>They found the baby in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>garbage dead.</v>

2127
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.510
<v Speaker 2>And she got arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was a girl I used to go to.</v>

2128
01:39:21.511 --> 01:39:23.190
<v Speaker 2>I used to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was a bank teller.</v>

2129
01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:25.230
<v Speaker 2>I would go to the teller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She like,</v>

2130
01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.360
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she seemed awkward,</v>

2131
01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:30.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was at Carnegie dates or anything.</v>

2132
01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

2133
01:39:31.700 --> 01:39:33.630
<v Speaker 2>She wasn't checking and she was a large </v>
<v Speaker 2>woman,</v>

2134
01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:35.610
<v Speaker 2>which is why nobody could tell that she </v>
<v Speaker 2>was pregnant.</v>

2135
01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:36.493
<v Speaker 2>She was big and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she apparently had been pregnant and </v>

2136
01:39:39.901 --> 01:39:40.734
<v Speaker 2>didn't tell anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nine months pregnant at work and </v>

2137
01:39:43.621 --> 01:39:44.454
<v Speaker 2>just had the baby in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the toilet and threw it in the </v>

2138
01:39:46.201 --> 01:39:47.034
<v Speaker 2>trashcan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if she didn't take the </v>

2139
01:39:49.141 --> 01:39:51.090
<v Speaker 2>trash out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how she got busted.</v>

2140
01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.470
<v Speaker 2>You imagine going into the bathroom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're taking a shit and you're like,</v>

2141
01:39:55.471 --> 01:39:56.304
<v Speaker 2>why does it smell like baby in here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that smell and then you look </v>

2142
01:39:59.491 --> 01:40:04.380
<v Speaker 2>into the wastepaper basket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see an I gotcha.</v>

2143
01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.480
<v Speaker 3>That is so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fucked up.</v>

2144
01:40:07.481 --> 01:40:09.970
<v Speaker 3>That was a real person that I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The country with.</v>

2145
01:40:09.971 --> 01:40:12.130
<v Speaker 3>The highest gender disparity of birth </v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't China.</v>

2146
01:40:12.131 --> 01:40:13.510
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lichtenstein.</v>

2147
01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:15.520
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's that terrible,</v>

2148
01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:17.330
<v Speaker 3>sad play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2149
01:40:17.740 --> 01:40:20.020
<v Speaker 3>let's find out what the ratio of men to </v>
<v Speaker 3>women.</v>

2150
01:40:20.021 --> 01:40:23.860
<v Speaker 3>It's the same about 33 million more men </v>
<v Speaker 3>than women.</v>

2151
01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:28.000
<v Speaker 3>So it was like 733 million men and 688 </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

2152
01:40:28.030 --> 01:40:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like nineties.</v>

2153
01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:32.620
<v Speaker 3>That's like in the nineties isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Says Christ.</v>

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>within 115 males.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Every one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead brother.</v>

2159
01:40:44.610 --> 01:40:48.580
<v Speaker 3>115 males to every 100 females.</v>
<v Speaker 3>China isn't the country that most store.</v>

2160
01:40:48.730 --> 01:40:50.380
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you're in a room,</v>

2161
01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:54.070
<v Speaker 3>there's 115 dudes in a hundred girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a crazy chair thing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's one's worse.</v>

2164
01:40:56.290 --> 01:40:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Where and linkedin sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 126 males to every hundred,</v>

2165
01:40:58.931 --> 01:41:00.640
<v Speaker 3>but there's only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's less than 40,000</v>

2166
01:41:00.641 --> 01:41:02.680
<v Speaker 3>people in the whole country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's even worse.</v>

2167
01:41:02.710 --> 01:41:06.430
<v Speaker 3>So the cause the cause there's less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less possibility.</v>

2168
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:08.410

2269
01:45:41.370 --> 01:45:45.640
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if we did an experiment where we</v>

2270

<v Speaker 8>both took a journey like that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>where I'll see you will be just like we </v>

2271
01:45:49.991 --> 01:45:52.540
<v Speaker 8>are now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it would be a hundred thousand years</v>

2272
01:45:52.541 --> 01:45:54.090
<v Speaker 8>of whatever you want later.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2276
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:08.860
<v Speaker 8>thousand years with no gay sex cause I </v>
<v Speaker 8>could do whatever I want.</v>

2277
01:46:08.861 --> 01:46:09.694
<v Speaker 8>Why would I fuck dudes?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would have sex with girls and then </v>

2278
01:46:11.981 --> 01:46:12.814
<v Speaker 8>when I was done having sex with girls,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would take a nap or I do some other </v>

2283
01:46:25.901 --> 01:46:26.681
<v Speaker 8>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no dude,</v>

2337
01:48:42.150 --> 01:48:45.180
<v Speaker 3>If you could do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can do whatever you want,</v>

2338
01:48:45.181 --> 01:48:46.014
<v Speaker 3>you would like full chart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if your life was a virtual </v>

2339
01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.513
<v Speaker 3>experience that you can control with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind is if you have a control </v>

2340
01:48:53.641 --> 01:48:54.474
<v Speaker 3>panel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would just start talking decks and </v>

2341
01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Ami.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be bulletproof robbing the banks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I didn't make a whole world.</v>

2343
01:49:02.310 --> 01:49:03.840

<v Speaker 3>I'd fly,</v>

2344
01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:05.790
<v Speaker 3>fly all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't land.</v>

<v Speaker 3>if you ever heard the Alan Watts thing </v>

2347
01:49:10.771 --> 01:49:11.604
<v Speaker 3>about this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever heard Alan Watts to talk about </v>

2348
01:49:12.511 --> 01:49:13.800
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to talk about a lot,</v>

2349
01:49:13.801 --> 01:49:17.070
<v Speaker 3>but not about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he really know?</v>

2350
01:49:17.071 --> 01:49:19.800
<v Speaker 3>He talks about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does this great thought experiment,</v>

2351
01:49:19.801 --> 01:49:20.940
<v Speaker 3>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2352
01:49:21.150 --> 01:49:23.520
<v Speaker 3>if you were able to do anything you </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted,</v>

2353
01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:25.460
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've definitely heard this,</v>

2354
01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:26.393
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you were able to do anything you </v>

2355
01:49:26.851 --> 01:49:27.684
<v Speaker 3>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are an infinite being omnipotent </v>

2356
01:49:29.071 --> 01:49:29.904
<v Speaker 3>and you can do whatever you want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would experiment with making </v>

2357
01:49:32.611 --> 01:49:35.220
<v Speaker 3>everything and you would try everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you would do everything.</v>

2358
01:49:35.221 --> 01:49:36.840
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

2359
01:49:36.841 --> 01:49:37.674
<v Speaker 3>you're literally in the state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative flow for infinity and you're </v>

2360
01:49:41.131 --> 01:49:43.200
<v Speaker 3>going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a great lecture that I'm going to</v>

2361
01:49:43.201 --> 01:49:44.850
<v Speaker 3>butcher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should look it up cause he's so,</v>

2362
01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 3>he's such an articulate genius.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the</v>

2363
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.813
<v Speaker 5>essence of the thing is eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eventually upon crew doing everything </v>

2364
01:49:52.691 --> 01:49:53.524
<v Speaker 5>and creating a universe and creating </v>
<v Speaker 5>planets and creating a planet where </v>

2365
01:49:55.781 --> 01:49:56.614
<v Speaker 5>there's life on it and being a God that </v>
<v Speaker 5>communicates with the beings on the </v>

2366
01:49:59.651 --> 01:50:00.484
<v Speaker 5>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to start thinking to </v>

2367
01:50:01.301 --> 01:50:02.134
<v Speaker 5>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what would happen if I made </v>

2368
01:50:04.811 --> 01:50:08.890
<v Speaker 5>myself one of the beings on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 5>and couldn't remember that I was God.</v>

2369
01:50:09.610 --> 01:50:11.890
<v Speaker 5>And that's what you are.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what we are,</v>

2370
01:50:11.891 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 5>is we are one of the experiments of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>divine seeing shit.</v>

2371
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:17.223
<v Speaker 5>I wonder what happens if I forget that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm capable of creating anything that I </v>

2372
01:50:19.871 --> 01:50:20.860
<v Speaker 5>want,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whenever I want,</v>

2373
01:50:20.861 --> 01:50:21.694
<v Speaker 5>that I've made the entire universe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me turn myself into this hyper </v>

2374
01:50:24.281 --> 01:50:28.240
<v Speaker 5>limited version of myself with no memory</v>
<v Speaker 5>of what I was in.</v>

2375
01:50:28.241 --> 01:50:30.880
<v Speaker 5>Play that game at that level.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause it's a lot more fun.</v>

2376
01:50:30.881 --> 01:50:32.350
<v Speaker 5>It's amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's exciting.</v>

2377
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:34.270
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

2378
01:50:34.271 --> 01:50:35.104
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's when Alan Watts starts </v>

2379
01:50:36.851 --> 01:50:41.650
<v Speaker 5>talking about which cox he would </v>
<v Speaker 5>simulate inside that machine.</v>

2380
01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:43.173
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2381
01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:44.313
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is.</v>

2382
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:47.400
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard of Marshall Mcluhan </v>
<v Speaker 2>speak?</v>

2383
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:48.960
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>

2384
01:50:48.990 --> 01:50:51.900
<v Speaker 2>there's some interesting youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2385
01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.100
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2386
01:50:53.190 --> 01:50:54.023
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could watch Mcluhan talk and he </v>

2387
01:50:55.711 --> 01:50:57.180
<v Speaker 2>doesn't look at anything like you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>expect.</v>

2388
01:50:57.450 --> 01:50:59.130
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But his,</v>

2389
01:50:59.131 --> 01:51:02.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kalki not in a non one say,</v>

2390
01:51:02.021 --> 01:51:02.854
<v Speaker 2>calculated his scientific dissection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's happening with media and </v>

2391
01:51:08.881 --> 01:51:09.714
<v Speaker 2>what's happening with technology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>where the future lies is so fascinating </v>

2392
01:51:13.201 --> 01:51:15.140
<v Speaker 2>because it's from the 1960s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2393
01:51:15.630 --> 01:51:16.463
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about the media is the </v>

2394
01:51:18.721 --> 01:51:20.910
<v Speaker 2>message I think is the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lecture and the book.</v>

2395
01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:25.410
<v Speaker 2>And that was the same book where he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote one of my all time favorite quotes</v>

2396
01:51:25.650 --> 01:51:28.440
<v Speaker 2>that human beings are the sex organs of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the machine world.</v>

2397
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:31.740
<v Speaker 2>Like this guy had no internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had,</v>

2398
01:51:31.770 --> 01:51:33.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing was like anything too in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bet.</v>

2399
01:51:33.911 --> 01:51:34.744
<v Speaker 2>And most electronics they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a goddamn calculator and it had </v>

2400
01:51:36.691 --> 01:51:37.910
<v Speaker 2>nothing to computers.</v>

2401
01:51:37.930 --> 01:51:40.080
<v Speaker 2>They have were giant rooms filled with </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2402
01:51:40.290 --> 01:51:41.123
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2403
01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:42.083
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But somehow or another he saw where it </v>

2404
01:51:43.381 --> 01:51:44.214
<v Speaker 2>was on Cohen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was seeing things and and pointing </v>

2405
01:51:47.161 --> 01:51:47.994
<v Speaker 2>things out just with the very nature of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our ability to communicate in our </v>

2406
01:51:51.691 --> 01:51:53.820
<v Speaker 2>ability to innovate and where it was all</v>
<v Speaker 2>headed.</v>

2407
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:54.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking fascinating cause you think </v>

2408
01:51:56.311 --> 01:52:00.270
<v Speaker 2>about how it did play out and no one saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>this common man.</v>

2409
01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.353
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But no one saw common was what we're on </v>

2410
01:52:02.581 --> 01:52:03.230
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2411
01:52:03.230 --> 01:52:04.063
<v Speaker 2>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fucking new thing where people can </v>

2412
01:52:07.261 --> 01:52:08.094
<v Speaker 2>just find out the answer to like we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>done so far today about scientific </v>

2413
01:52:12.961 --> 01:52:15.180
<v Speaker 2>questions about descartes car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2414
01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:16.513
<v Speaker 2>Can periods that these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was constructed and when did this </v>

2415
01:52:19.021 --> 01:52:21.360
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And 1,079</v>

2416
01:52:21.361 --> 01:52:22.630
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you,</v>

2417
01:52:22.890 --> 01:52:23.723
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2418
01:52:23.730 --> 01:52:28.260
<v Speaker 2>you're getting a download like anybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ever lived.</v>

2419
01:52:28.261 --> 01:52:29.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2420
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:33.060
<v Speaker 2>Everybody can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That this is the thing that's making the</v>

2421
01:52:33.061 --> 01:52:36.360
<v Speaker 2>boundaries between us and the leaders of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

2422
01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:41.550
<v Speaker 2>This is why there's such a problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we have all the information too,</v>

2423
01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:43.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has all the information.</v>

2424
01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the only thing that's keeping it all</v>

2425
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:45.793
<v Speaker 2>glued together as tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that's keeping the </v>

2426
01:52:48.081 --> 01:52:48.914
<v Speaker 2>hierarchies into the position of power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're out right now without being </v>

2427
01:52:51.261 --> 01:52:54.680
<v Speaker 2>completely abandoned and restructured </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the bottom up.</v>

2428
01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:56.720
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's keeping them </v>
<v Speaker 2>together as tradition,</v>

2429
01:52:56.780 --> 01:52:57.920
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

2430
01:52:58.040 --> 01:52:58.873
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's keeping government</v>
<v Speaker 2>and just borders and nations and the </v>

2431
01:53:04.581 --> 01:53:05.414
<v Speaker 2>whole concept that were existing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there are a bunch of different </v>

2432
01:53:07.431 --> 01:53:08.264
<v Speaker 2>countries and there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different leaders and this guy controls </v>

2433
01:53:10.530 --> 01:53:10.761
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

2434
01:53:10.761 --> 01:53:11.210
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

2435
01:53:11.210 --> 01:53:13.220
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's keeping that </v>
<v Speaker 2>together as tradition.</v>

2436
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:14.083
<v Speaker 2>The only thing if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we eventually can communicate with </v>

2437
01:53:16.881 --> 01:53:21.881
<v Speaker 2>each other in a way that for goes all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the current limitations and all the past</v>

2438
01:53:22.551 --> 01:53:23.384
<v Speaker 2>limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that bypasses all that stuff </v>

2439
01:53:24.981 --> 01:53:25.814
<v Speaker 2>it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things is going to go </v>

2440
01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:29.570
<v Speaker 2>is the illogical traditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2441
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:33.710
<v Speaker 2>but it seems like its traditions being </v>
<v Speaker 2>guarded by dudes with guns.</v>

2442
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:34.843
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those dudes with guns are going to </v>

2443
01:53:36.531 --> 01:53:40.280
<v Speaker 2>die and new young dudes with guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to take their place.</v>

2444
01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.950
<v Speaker 2>This is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it might take generations,</v>

2445
01:53:43.100 --> 01:53:43.933
<v Speaker 2>but this is what happens with ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just happening so fast now and some </v>

2446
01:53:47.241 --> 01:53:48.074
<v Speaker 2>of the people with the old Id,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were born and raised with the old </v>

2447
01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:51.290
<v Speaker 2>items.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're still around.</v>

2448
01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:52.980
<v Speaker 2>They're still stuck in this old </v>
<v Speaker 2>sistance.</v>

2449
01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:53.903
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then this new system has blossomed </v>

2450
01:53:55.191 --> 01:53:57.000
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're trapped shitting</v>

2451
01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:57.833
<v Speaker 5>bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're shitting bricks and they're </v>

2452
01:53:58.261 --> 01:53:59.970
<v Speaker 5>trying to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

2453
01:54:00.030 --> 01:54:02.880
<v Speaker 5>And they're actively trying to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you hear that shit?</v>

2454
01:54:02.881 --> 01:54:03.714
<v Speaker 5>Jeff sessions said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mean to keep harping on that </v>

2455
01:54:05.161 --> 01:54:05.994
<v Speaker 5>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he,</v>

2456
01:54:06.150 --> 01:54:07.440
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

2457
01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:08.613
<v Speaker 5>he said that like he just came out again</v>
<v Speaker 5>saying that he thinks that the opioid </v>

2458
01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:14.213
<v Speaker 5>epidemic as they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is being partially fueled by marijuana </v>

2459
01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:19.193
<v Speaker 5>is a gateway drug that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>marijuana is getting people on a </v>

2460
01:54:23.401 --> 01:54:26.790
<v Speaker 5>painkillers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a completely raw,</v>

2461
01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:27.451
<v Speaker 5>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2462
01:54:27.451 --> 01:54:29.130
<v Speaker 5>not only is it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it wrong,</v>

2463
01:54:29.131 --> 01:54:34.131
<v Speaker 5>it's like they can show statistics that </v>
<v Speaker 5>seem to indicate that the opposite.</v>

2464
01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:35.780
<v Speaker 5>The opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:54:35.880 --> 01:54:39.240
<v Speaker 5>But that crazy fuck is saying it </v>
<v Speaker 5>publicly.</v>

2466
01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:43.130
<v Speaker 5>Like it's real and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the too,</v>

2467
01:54:43.230 --> 01:54:44.063
<v Speaker 5>just the fact that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that man is allowed to continue having </v>

2468
01:54:47.551 --> 01:54:48.384
<v Speaker 5>his job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which theoretically somebody who was in </v>

2469
01:54:50.491 --> 01:54:51.324
<v Speaker 5>his position should be so hyper aware of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the data on all drugs because a person </v>

2470
01:54:58.111 --> 01:54:58.944
<v Speaker 5>in that position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need a person just like you were </v>

2471
01:55:01.111 --> 01:55:01.944
<v Speaker 5>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we need shepherds like this fucking </v>

2472
01:55:03.481 --> 01:55:04.650
<v Speaker 5>fentanyl shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2473
01:55:05.060 --> 01:55:06.090
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of my friends,</v>

2474
01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:07.620
<v Speaker 5>he lost his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

2475
01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:08.573
<v Speaker 5>his wife to this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I ended up so many people are dying </v>

2476
01:55:10.801 --> 01:55:11.634
<v Speaker 5>because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we know a couple people that have </v>

2477
01:55:13.411 --> 01:55:14.760
<v Speaker 5>died from it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible.</v>

2478
01:55:14.761 --> 01:55:17.170
<v Speaker 5>It's Tom Petty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so sad.</v>

2479
01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:19.350
<v Speaker 5>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But we need,</v>

2480
01:55:19.590 --> 01:55:22.750
<v Speaker 5>so we need to have some regulatory </v>
<v Speaker 5>force.</v>

2481
01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:23.593
<v Speaker 5>It's making sure that these poisons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not regulating that they're </v>

2482
01:55:25.981 --> 01:55:28.440
<v Speaker 5>going after the stuff that's the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>safest,</v>

2483
01:55:28.441 --> 01:55:30.450
<v Speaker 5>the most beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Medicinal.</v>

2484
01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:33.570
<v Speaker 5>Could you imagine having a podcast with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jeff sessions?</v>

2485
01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:38.100
<v Speaker 5>Is You sitting across from Jeff sessions</v>
<v Speaker 5>for three hours and talking to him about</v>

2486

<v Speaker 5>things?</v>

01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:48.540
<v Speaker 2>I've heard he's like funny and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2491
01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:52.570

2493
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:56.160

01:55:56.161 --> 01:55:58.260
<v Speaker 2>I bet you chip away through all that.</v>

<v Speaker 2>if only jeff sessions was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>lizard.</v>

2501
01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:11.490
<v Speaker 2>The problem is it's like they're not </v>

2508
01:56:25.801 --> 01:56:28.830
<v Speaker 2>compassion for these people because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not bad.</v>

2509
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:29.843
<v Speaker 2>They're misguided and they're informed </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they can be turned around with the </v>

2510
01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:34.440
<v Speaker 2>proper experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2511
01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:37.470
<v Speaker 2>And if they're willing to abandon their </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous notions,</v>

2512
01:56:37.471 --> 01:56:38.304
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is so many people are so</v>
<v Speaker 2>invested in their identity that it's </v>

2513
01:56:41.281 --> 01:56:42.114
<v Speaker 2>impossible for them to give up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their notion is just like the </v>

2514
01:56:43.411 --> 01:56:44.244
<v Speaker 2>Egyptologists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to look at the possibility </v>

2515
01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:46.973
<v Speaker 2>that may be there've been doing these </v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic constructions in Egypt a lot </v>

2516
01:56:50.761 --> 01:56:53.230
<v Speaker 2>longer than we think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is entirely possible.</v>

2517
01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.153
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean that the great pay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean take it back to Egypt one last </v>

2518
01:56:56.431 --> 01:56:57.264
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no one's doubting that the Great </v>

2519
01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Pyramid of Giza was constructed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere around 2,500</v>

2520
01:57:01.621 --> 01:57:02.454
<v Speaker 2>BC according to the previous or all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>data that we have right now because </v>

2521
01:57:05.371 --> 01:57:06.204
<v Speaker 2>they've been able to carbon date stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they find like in between the </v>

2522
01:57:08.011 --> 01:57:08.760
<v Speaker 2>stones.</v>

2523
01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:10.920
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty sure that it's somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 2>in that range.</v>

2524
01:57:10.921 --> 01:57:11.970
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're off here.</v>

2525
01:57:11.971 --> 01:57:14.430
<v Speaker 2>They're a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some other construction that</v>

2526
01:57:14.970 --> 01:57:17.280
<v Speaker 2>John Anthony West pointed out that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>buried under sand.</v>

2527
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:18.114
<v Speaker 2>They find that's like wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it might've been buried for who </v>

2528
01:57:19.981 --> 01:57:20.814
<v Speaker 2>knows how fucking long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a different style of </v>

2529
01:57:22.021 --> 01:57:22.854
<v Speaker 2>construction and it looks really old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like one of the things about the styles </v>

2530
01:57:26.311 --> 01:57:28.910
<v Speaker 2>of construction and the things that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>find in,</v>

2531
01:57:28.911 --> 01:57:29.610
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2532
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:33.780
<v Speaker 2>in Egypt is a lot of it is buried in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sand after why even the Sphinx itself,</v>

2533
01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:35.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they found the Sphinx.</v>

2534
01:57:35.490 --> 01:57:39.840
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that is in,</v>

2535
01:57:39.890 --> 01:57:42.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the ancient hieroglyphs,</v>

2536
01:57:42.181 --> 01:57:45.630
<v Speaker 2>it's attributed to being alive at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time as a scroll.</v>

2537
01:57:45.631 --> 01:57:46.464
<v Speaker 2>I forget which pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he heard in a dream that if he </v>

2538
01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:52.193
<v Speaker 2>uncovered the Sphinx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he would become pharaoh of Egypt </v>

2539
01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:56.630
<v Speaker 2>because it was covered in sand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to,</v>

2540
01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.870
<v Speaker 2>he had written down at that time and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this was like 2000 bc or something crazy</v>

2541
01:58:00.871 --> 01:58:01.380
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2542
01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:03.870
<v Speaker 2>It was covered in sand then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2543
01:58:04.260 --> 01:58:07.040
<v Speaker 2>They don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so little they know about</v>

2544
01:58:07.050 --> 01:58:09.120
<v Speaker 2>you made it and why you know the answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this.</v>

2545
01:58:09.540 --> 01:58:11.640
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is probably a dumb question,</v>

2546
01:58:11.670 --> 01:58:14.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not deep as the sand out there.</v>

2547
01:58:14.911 --> 01:58:17.430
<v Speaker 2>Like how far down does that fact?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very good question.</v>

2548
01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:20.610
<v Speaker 2>That's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When does the sand,</v>

2549
01:58:20.611 --> 01:58:24.360
<v Speaker 2>here's the other thing is in San from </v>
<v Speaker 2>oceans beating down rocks.</v>

2550
01:58:24.780 --> 01:58:26.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what sand is.</v>

2551
01:58:27.090 --> 01:58:27.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

2552
01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:30.330
<v Speaker 2>that's what's the most fucked up thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the desert.</v>

2553
01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:32.070
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no goddamn ocean,</v>

2554
01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:35.720
<v Speaker 2>but you've got so much sand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2555
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:37.800
<v Speaker 2>That is mostly from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what isn't it?</v>

2556
01:58:37.890 --> 01:58:38.723
<v Speaker 2>I think sans mostly created,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably created few different </v>

2557
01:58:41.501 --> 01:58:42.334
<v Speaker 2>ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's mostly created by </v>

2558
01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:46.030
<v Speaker 2>oceans beating down rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2559
01:58:46.540 --> 01:58:49.880
<v Speaker 2>So that's just time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just looking at time.</v>

2560
01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:52.870
<v Speaker 2>The craziest fucking stamp of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can look at it.</v>

2561
01:58:52.871 --> 01:58:53.704
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long does it take for an ocean to </v>

2562
01:58:55.631 --> 01:58:59.260
<v Speaker 2>turn rocks into a Goddamn desert?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2563
01:58:59.261 --> 01:59:02.980
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is under this is Sam Mega Lake.</v>

2564
01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need the sands of the Sahara desert.</v>

2565
01:59:06.101 --> 01:59:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Scientists have discovered evidence of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>prehistoric mega lake.</v>

2566
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:13.120
<v Speaker 2>There's a monster down there using </v>
<v Speaker 2>images of wind blown sediments,</v>

2567
01:59:13.121 --> 01:59:17.140
<v Speaker 2>sediments produced by running water and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bedrock seen by radar beneath the desert</v>

2568
01:59:17.141 --> 01:59:19.060
<v Speaker 2>sands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The geologists piece together,</v>

2569
01:59:19.061 --> 01:59:19.894
<v Speaker 2>the profile of an ancient wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So goes the sand goes 69 to 141 feet in </v>

2570
01:59:27.521 --> 01:59:32.521
<v Speaker 2>the Sahara and three feet in the Simpson</v>
<v Speaker 2>desert.</v>

2571
01:59:32.531 --> 01:59:33.364
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The depths of sand varies widely around </v>

2572
01:59:35.591 --> 01:59:37.690
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know 141 feet.</v>

2573
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>141 feet of just sand.</v>

2574
01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:42.063
<v Speaker 2>So am I right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sand is created by the ocean </v>

2575
01:59:44.291 --> 01:59:45.124
<v Speaker 2>beating down rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's true most of the time of </v>

2576
01:59:47.651 --> 01:59:48.484
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not true all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so nice to be so stupid that you </v>

2577
01:59:50.921 --> 01:59:51.460
<v Speaker 2>just ask.</v>

2578
01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:54.150
<v Speaker 5>Sounds Fun to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you get to know,</v>

2579
01:59:54.151 --> 01:59:56.310
<v Speaker 5>like it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No idea.</v>

2580
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:58.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2581
01:59:58.631 --> 01:59:59.464
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to a Neil degrasse Tyson the </v>

2582
02:00:01.511 --> 02:00:04.510
<v Speaker 2>other day and he was trying to explain </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2583
02:00:04.570 --> 02:00:06.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2584
02:00:06.340 --> 02:00:09.490
<v Speaker 2>escape velocity like any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he takes my shoe,</v>

2585
02:00:09.491 --> 02:00:10.324
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me see your shoe and he takes my </v>

2586
02:00:11.351 --> 02:00:13.900
<v Speaker 2>shoe and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now if I throw this up in there,</v>

2587
02:00:13.901 --> 02:00:17.110
<v Speaker 2>it's going to come down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I throw it hard enough,</v>

2588
02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:20.770
<v Speaker 2>it will escape the pull of the gravity </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the earth.</v>

2589
02:00:20.771 --> 02:00:22.300
<v Speaker 2>And once it's free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll go on forever.</v>

2590
02:00:22.330 --> 02:00:23.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see it?</v>

2591
02:00:23.271 --> 02:00:24.050
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2592
02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:26.560
<v Speaker 2>that's fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2593
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Like he tried to like put that in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>head like,</v>

2594
02:00:29.111 --> 02:00:30.010
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

2595
02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:32.730
<v Speaker 5>goes on forever?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't that the problem?</v>

2596
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:36.300
<v Speaker 5>Now this it sky,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is great to just dummies talking.</v>

2597
02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:37.173
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Isn't this the problem with the moon is </v>

2598
02:00:38.851 --> 02:00:41.970
<v Speaker 5>that not the problem with the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you jump on the moon,</v>

2599
02:00:42.330 --> 02:00:43.163
<v Speaker 5>you can escape the escape.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's easier to get out of the </v>

2600
02:00:45.181 --> 02:00:46.590
<v Speaker 5>escape velocity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The moon.</v>

2601
02:00:46.620 --> 02:00:47.520
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one six.</v>

2602
02:00:47.521 --> 02:00:48.900
<v Speaker 5>Earth's gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh really?</v>

2603
02:00:48.901 --> 02:00:50.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought we started on the moon.</v>

2604
02:00:50.341 --> 02:00:51.990
<v Speaker 5>You can like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2605
02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:53.341
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2606
02:00:53.341 --> 02:00:54.050
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2607
02:00:54.050 --> 02:00:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Can theoretically you can jump higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you believe in NASA,</v>

2608
02:01:00.201 --> 02:01:01.034
<v Speaker 2>bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some videos of guys jumping </v>

2609
02:01:02.571 --> 02:01:03.710
<v Speaker 2>around on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2610
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:04.603
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the videos of people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon is that there are videos that </v>

2611
02:01:08.841 --> 02:01:09.674
<v Speaker 2>look 100% fake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but guys fall forward and it looks like </v>

2612
02:01:13.191 --> 02:01:14.024
<v Speaker 2>they get yanked up by wires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of video that looks fake </v>

2613
02:01:16.971 --> 02:01:19.610
<v Speaker 2>as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it's fake.</v>

2614
02:01:19.670 --> 02:01:20.503
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it just looked fake </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's one sixth of the Earth's </v>

2615
02:01:22.611 --> 02:01:23.444
<v Speaker 2>gravity and we don't know what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really looks like until you see it play </v>

2616
02:01:25.221 --> 02:01:26.054
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's some videos of guys falling </v>

2617
02:01:27.081 --> 02:01:29.480
<v Speaker 2>down face first and getting yanked back </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

2618
02:01:29.481 --> 02:01:30.770
<v Speaker 2>It looks like the yanked by court.</v>

2619
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:32.830
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that picture of that thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>that looks at Jamie?</v>

2620
02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:35.000
<v Speaker 5>What after we talked about this last </v>
<v Speaker 5>time,</v>

2621
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:36.223
<v Speaker 5>some people send in videos of an NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Players do the exact same thing in the </v>

2622
02:01:38.901 --> 02:01:39.860
<v Speaker 5>end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2623
02:01:39.861 --> 02:01:40.340
<v Speaker 5>super</v>

2624
02:01:40.340 --> 02:01:41.173
<v Speaker 8>athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's three or four guys doing throw </v>

2625
02:01:42.321 --> 02:01:43.154
<v Speaker 8>their body,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they don't have a giant pack on </v>

2626
02:01:44.241 --> 02:01:45.920
<v Speaker 8>their back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And when wearing helmets,</v>

2627
02:01:45.921 --> 02:01:46.754
<v Speaker 8>they're wearing helmets.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That Shit's light compared to what the </v>

2628
02:01:48.381 --> 02:01:49.490
<v Speaker 8>astronauts are wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dude,</v>

2629
02:01:49.530 --> 02:01:54.290
<v Speaker 8>astronauts have like a once in a suit </v>
<v Speaker 8>that keeps them grabbing a drink concept</v>

2630
02:01:54.291 --> 02:01:55.160
<v Speaker 8>is the suit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If there,</v>

2631
02:01:55.161 --> 02:01:57.580
<v Speaker 8>the concept is they're not even on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking moon and then that suit,</v>

2632
02:01:57.590 --> 02:01:58.423
<v Speaker 8>it could just be paper Miss Shea,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but some of the ones where they're </v>

2633
02:02:00.291 --> 02:02:03.080
<v Speaker 8>pitched completely forward and they just</v>
<v Speaker 8>go badly what it is.</v>

2634
02:02:03.081 --> 02:02:04.130
<v Speaker 8>I'm trying to find it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2635
02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:05.900
<v Speaker 8>I would love to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's interesting.</v>

2636
02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:08.690
<v Speaker 8>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're still wavering on whether we went</v>

2637
02:02:08.691 --> 02:02:10.050
<v Speaker 8>to the mint.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm more weight.</v>

2638
02:02:10.070 --> 02:02:10.903
<v Speaker 8>I'm numb.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm too dumb and uneducated to really </v>

2639
02:02:13.371 --> 02:02:14.000
<v Speaker 8>know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2640
02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.630
<v Speaker 8>But I am wavering more on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>possibility that some of the footage was</v>

2641
02:02:17.631 --> 02:02:20.740
<v Speaker 8>faked super quick.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a five second videos like no.</v>

2642
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:21.703
<v Speaker 8>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Go ahead.</v>

2643
02:02:23.340 --> 02:02:24.173
<v Speaker 11>Boom.</v>

2644
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:28.310
<v Speaker 8>That is not the same thing Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can do that.</v>

2645
02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:30.950
<v Speaker 8>Super similar bull shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can do that.</v>

2646
02:02:31.010 --> 02:02:32.930
<v Speaker 8>That guy goes to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll do that right now.</v>

2647
02:02:32.950 --> 02:02:33.783
<v Speaker 8>Find another one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The guy goes to his knees and then uses </v>

2648
02:02:35.540 --> 02:02:37.850
<v Speaker 8>his momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The pop up from his knees.</v>

2649
02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.740
<v Speaker 8>I've seen some that look pretty crazy </v>
<v Speaker 8>though,</v>

2650
02:02:39.741 --> 02:02:40.220
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dude,</v>

2651
02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:43.530
<v Speaker 8>that's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The moon ones are way more preposterous.</v>

2652
02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:46.670
<v Speaker 8>Better examples in that though.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's super athletes.</v>

2653
02:02:46.730 --> 02:02:47.563
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What they're doing is springing up and </v>

2654
02:02:49.071 --> 02:02:51.170
<v Speaker 8>you can see the kinetic energy from </v>
<v Speaker 8>their legs.</v>

2655
02:02:51.171 --> 02:02:53.270
<v Speaker 8>It's forcing them up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They're super athletes,</v>

2656
02:02:53.271 --> 02:02:54.030
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>They,</v>

2657
02:02:54.030 --> 02:02:54.863
<v Speaker 8>they show off.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those guys do back flips and shit all </v>

2658
02:02:56.151 --> 02:02:56.984
<v Speaker 8>the time there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They are physically capable of doing </v>

2659
02:02:58.641 --> 02:02:59.474
<v Speaker 8>things in a normal person cannot do,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they're not physically capable of </v>

2660
02:03:02.091 --> 02:03:02.924
<v Speaker 8>defying physics.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What you're seeing in a lot of those </v>

2661
02:03:04.641 --> 02:03:08.240
<v Speaker 8>moon videos looks like someone's defined</v>
<v Speaker 8>because it's like they pitch forward and</v>

2662
02:03:08.241 --> 02:03:09.170
<v Speaker 8>they bounce back up.</v>

2663
02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:12.680
<v Speaker 8>I think they shot a bunch of shit and I </v>
<v Speaker 8>think some of the video,</v>

2664
02:03:12.681 --> 02:03:15.380
<v Speaker 8>if you're going into space and you're </v>
<v Speaker 8>experiencing deep radiation,</v>

2665
02:03:15.381 --> 02:03:17.990
<v Speaker 8>the van Allen radiation belts and from </v>
<v Speaker 8>the sun did,</v>

2666
02:03:17.991 --> 02:03:20.720
<v Speaker 8>you can't even go through the fucking x </v>
<v Speaker 8>ray machine at the airport,</v>

2667
02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:23.720
<v Speaker 8>the old x ray machines with film.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They wouldn't let you.</v>

2668
02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.270
<v Speaker 8>Cause if you went through with Phil and </v>
<v Speaker 8>would kill your fucking film,</v>

2669
02:03:26.370 --> 02:03:27.203
<v Speaker 8>so how are they getting these perfect </v>
<v Speaker 8>videos and photos and none of them are </v>

2670
02:03:29.271 --> 02:03:30.104
<v Speaker 8>fucked up by radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's entirely possible that they did go </v>

2671
02:03:33.081 --> 02:03:33.914
<v Speaker 8>to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but they faked a bunch of the film </v>

2672
02:03:35.601 --> 02:03:39.320
<v Speaker 8>footage because they wanted to have </v>
<v Speaker 8>something and they couldn't really bring</v>

2673
02:03:39.321 --> 02:03:41.480
<v Speaker 8>anything back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's entirely possible.</v>

2674
02:03:41.630 --> 02:03:45.200
<v Speaker 8>There's fake footage from the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 8>100% is a precedent.</v>

2675
02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:46.333
<v Speaker 8>The footage of Yuri Gagarin when he's </v>
<v Speaker 8>circling the earth for the first time </v>

2676
02:03:50.181 --> 02:03:51.980
<v Speaker 8>and he goes on a rocket and the first </v>
<v Speaker 8>guy in space,</v>

2677
02:03:52.340 --> 02:03:53.600
<v Speaker 8>it's fake as fuck dude.</v>

2678
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:56.450
<v Speaker 8>He's inside this tiny little compartment</v>
<v Speaker 8>and all sudden there's,</v>

2679
02:03:56.540 --> 02:03:59.750
<v Speaker 8>they've got ruined there for a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Get the fuck Outta here bitch.</v>

2680
02:03:59.840 --> 02:04:01.700
<v Speaker 8>You See a light source this way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the light source.</v>

2681
02:04:01.701 --> 02:04:02.534
<v Speaker 8>That way he's got dueling shadows behind</v>
<v Speaker 8>him cause they got lights set up in </v>

2682
02:04:05.481 --> 02:04:08.390
<v Speaker 8>there cause they're filming him inside </v>
<v Speaker 8>this capsule.</v>

2683
02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:10.430
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he shot up in the space.</v>

2684
02:04:10.490 --> 02:04:12.470
<v Speaker 8>You really did do it but they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>fit it.</v>

2685
02:04:12.471 --> 02:04:14.420
<v Speaker 8>Bad damn camera in his tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 8>capsule.</v>

2686
02:04:14.450 --> 02:04:15.081
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's,</v>

2687
02:04:15.081 --> 02:04:18.320
<v Speaker 8>there's no room so they just faked it </v>
<v Speaker 8>after the fact.</v>

2688
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:19.940
<v Speaker 8>Make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Of course it makes sense.</v>

2689
02:04:19.941 --> 02:04:22.130
<v Speaker 8>A lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There was no internet back then.</v>

2690
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:26.600
<v Speaker 8>There was no vhs tapes back then.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They broadcast something on tv as far as</v>

2691
02:04:26.601 --> 02:04:27.434
<v Speaker 8>their eyes and their mind goes,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that was the only time people are going </v>

2692
02:04:29.991 --> 02:04:30.920
<v Speaker 8>to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

2693
02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:32.710
<v Speaker 8>All they have to do is show it to you </v>
<v Speaker 8>once,</v>

2694
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:33.590
<v Speaker 8>pull it off.</v>

2695
02:04:33.590 --> 02:04:34.423
<v Speaker 8>Nobody ever imagined you'd be able to </v>
<v Speaker 8>pull it up on your phone or to stoners </v>

2696
02:04:38.581 --> 02:04:41.100
<v Speaker 8>like you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We'll be watching on a podcast.</v>

2697
02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:45.030
<v Speaker 8>It's even find the video of Yuri Gagarin</v>
<v Speaker 8>from inside his,</v>

2698
02:04:45.570 --> 02:04:47.490
<v Speaker 8>what would you call those things?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Pods.</v>

2699
02:04:47.491 --> 02:04:50.850
<v Speaker 8>Pods,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which call it Yuri Gagarin in space.</v>

2700
02:04:50.940 --> 02:04:53.490
<v Speaker 8>You Watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You go get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2701
02:04:53.670 --> 02:04:55.110
<v Speaker 8>You watch it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>

2702
02:04:55.330 --> 02:04:58.370
<v Speaker 8>That is fake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That is not him or this.</v>

2703
02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:02.500
<v Speaker 8>Not Him in space rather.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So your nose and blast off.</v>

2704
02:05:04.060 --> 02:05:06.890
<v Speaker 8>Here he is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's getting on the bus studies.</v>

2705
02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:09.720
<v Speaker 8>Headache to space.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I can't believe it.</v>

2706
02:05:09.721 --> 02:05:11.640
<v Speaker 8>You're ready?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Show me where are you?</v>

2707
02:05:11.641 --> 02:05:13.020
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so he's in this state.</v>

2708
02:05:13.021 --> 02:05:14.190
<v Speaker 8>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't back it up.</v>

2709
02:05:14.250 --> 02:05:16.230
<v Speaker 8>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's it.</v>

2710
02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:19.810
<v Speaker 8>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Are we good?</v>

2711
02:05:19.930 --> 02:05:21.370
<v Speaker 8>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're going to strap up.</v>

2712
02:05:21.450 --> 02:05:25.690
<v Speaker 8>How am I go and turn off to look at the </v>
<v Speaker 8>lights?</v>

2713
02:05:26.020 --> 02:05:26.590
<v Speaker 8>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hold up,</v>

2714
02:05:26.590 --> 02:05:27.550
<v Speaker 8>back up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>back up,</v>

2715
02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:28.571
<v Speaker 8>back up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Stop.</v>

2716
02:05:28.571 --> 02:05:30.610
<v Speaker 8>Pause it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Leave the shadows.</v>

2717
02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:32.320
<v Speaker 8>Shadow to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Shout out to the right.</v>

2718
02:05:32.420 --> 02:05:33.790
<v Speaker 8>This is fucking lights in front of them.</v>

2719
02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:37.460
<v Speaker 8>They would lights in there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's in his tiny little cat.</v>

2720
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:39.830
<v Speaker 8>This tiny little pod.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How's it lit up?</v>

2721
02:05:40.850 --> 02:05:42.560
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe they just have,</v>

2722
02:05:42.561 --> 02:05:45.040
<v Speaker 8>I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean it's still windows.</v>

2723
02:05:45.050 --> 02:05:46.850
<v Speaker 8>Why couldn't they have lights in there </v>
<v Speaker 8>joe?</v>

2724
02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:52.430
<v Speaker 8>Because they've got no room had it seems</v>
<v Speaker 8>like there's enough lights back then.</v>

2725
02:05:52.431 --> 02:05:56.920
<v Speaker 8>Think about these candles.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They campfire you fire in there.</v>

2726
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:59.960
<v Speaker 8>I saw a few breakdowns of the moon </v>
<v Speaker 8>landing two that said it would be way,</v>

2727
02:05:59.961 --> 02:06:00.794
<v Speaker 8>way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>way harder to fake it back then than it </v>

2728
02:06:02.061 --> 02:06:03.770
<v Speaker 8>would have been to actually just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I read that too.</v>

2729
02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:04.700
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've heard that too,</v>

2730
02:06:04.850 --> 02:06:07.160
<v Speaker 8>but I don't think we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 8>faking going to the moon.</v>

2731
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:09.200
<v Speaker 8>You're not understanding what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 8>saying.</v>

2732
02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:10.393
<v Speaker 8>We're talking about faking footage,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not talking about faking going to the </v>

2733
02:06:13.390 --> 02:06:15.560
<v Speaker 8>moon like I think they probably did go </v>
<v Speaker 8>to the moon,</v>

2734
02:06:15.920 --> 02:06:16.753
<v Speaker 8>but I would imagine that at least some </v>
<v Speaker 8>of the footage you're seeing is horse </v>

2735
02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:20.630
<v Speaker 8>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>From what I,</v>

2736
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:24.980
<v Speaker 8>I wasn't obviously alive then.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was like a 140 minute live stream.</v>

2737
02:06:27.010 --> 02:06:27.980
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

2738
02:06:27.981 --> 02:06:28.581
<v Speaker 8>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

2739
02:06:28.581 --> 02:06:30.710
<v Speaker 8>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you just have people in orbit,</v>

2740
02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:33.530
<v Speaker 8>it wouldn't be hard to fake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look,</v>

2741
02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:36.500
<v Speaker 8>I think it'd be harder to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That would be to fake it.</v>

2742
02:06:37.160 --> 02:06:39.770
<v Speaker 8>I think going there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if they did go to there and I think they</v>

2743
02:06:39.771 --> 02:06:43.130
<v Speaker 8>probably did was an unbelievably </v>
<v Speaker 8>difficult thing to do,</v>

2744
02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:46.190
<v Speaker 8>but like thinking that they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how hard would that be?</v>

2745
02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:47.773
<v Speaker 8>Like?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like after the fact like filming </v>

2746
02:06:49.371 --> 02:06:50.204
<v Speaker 8>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're filming footage of them in orbit </v>

2747
02:06:51.651 --> 02:06:55.250
<v Speaker 8>and is the part you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that would have been a mile of film Joe.</v>

2748
02:06:55.251 --> 02:06:56.084
<v Speaker 8>It's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why do you know that all that Shit's </v>

2749
02:06:58.581 --> 02:06:59.414
<v Speaker 8>missing?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know all the original footage is </v>

2750
02:07:00.981 --> 02:07:03.260
<v Speaker 8>missing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's the weirdest fucking thing,</v>

2751
02:07:03.590 --> 02:07:04.423
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

2752
02:07:04.700 --> 02:07:06.260
<v Speaker 8>I know you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're being skeptical guy.</v>

2753
02:07:06.261 --> 02:07:07.094
<v Speaker 8>I looked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's missing or a bigger one that only </v>

2754
02:07:09.471 --> 02:07:11.540
<v Speaker 8>that you know what else is missing but </v>
<v Speaker 8>telemetry data,</v>

2755
02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:12.733
<v Speaker 8>all the ones and Zeros that show the </v>
<v Speaker 8>location of the capsule or whatever the </v>

2756
02:07:15.381 --> 02:07:16.190
<v Speaker 8>fuck it is on the waist.</v>

2757
02:07:16.190 --> 02:07:17.023
<v Speaker 8>I thought from what I read,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they still have that data that just the </v>

2758
02:07:18.921 --> 02:07:20.480
<v Speaker 8>original like paper,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was on it.</v>

2759
02:07:20.481 --> 02:07:23.030
<v Speaker 8>The original magnetic tapes got reused </v>
<v Speaker 8>because they needed to.</v>

2760
02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:24.320
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well why would you say that?</v>

2761
02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:25.273
<v Speaker 8>Unless you just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why don't you just google it and find </v>

2762
02:07:26.271 --> 02:07:27.110
<v Speaker 8>out?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what I read.</v>

2763
02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:28.260
<v Speaker 8>I read when last time,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2764
02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:29.493
<v Speaker 8>what'd you read?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I read that that original tapes got </v>

2765
02:07:31.551 --> 02:07:32.384
<v Speaker 8>written over because they needed to </v>
<v Speaker 8>magnetic tape because there was a </v>

2766
02:07:34.191 --> 02:07:35.520
<v Speaker 8>shortage at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2767
02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:38.500
<v Speaker 8>So but still,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but the date is still somewhere else.</v>

2768
02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:43.000
<v Speaker 8>There was a short,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they recorded over the original tapes of</v>

2769
02:07:43.001 --> 02:07:43.834
<v Speaker 8>the fucking moon landing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How much of a shortage of magnetic tape </v>

2770
02:07:46.631 --> 02:07:47.464
<v Speaker 8>do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Where are you going to record over all </v>

2771
02:07:49.300 --> 02:07:53.040
<v Speaker 8>of the video from the mother fucking </v>
<v Speaker 8>moon landing hank it.</v>

2779
02:08:09.461 --> 02:08:12.270
<v Speaker 8>but they record over the fucking moon </v>
<v Speaker 8>landing.</v>

2780
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:15.700
<v Speaker 8>Let's just fucking record over the first</v>
<v Speaker 8>time in human history.</v>

2781
02:08:15.701 --> 02:08:19.450
<v Speaker 8>Literally the craziest thing in human </v>
<v Speaker 8>history to ever record.</v>

2782
02:08:19.451 --> 02:08:21.790
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it is the dumbest thing in human.</v>

2783
02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:24.490
<v Speaker 8>I'm not saying they didn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They might have,</v>

2784
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:29.110
<v Speaker 8>the official story might be legit </v>
<v Speaker 8>casino,</v>

2785
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:30.033
<v Speaker 8>but it might not.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Where do you put your money on the moon </v>

2786
02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:31.871
<v Speaker 8>lighting?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because you know what?</v>

2787
02:08:31.871 --> 02:08:34.510
<v Speaker 8>I'm detecting Joe when we first got to </v>
<v Speaker 8>be friends,</v>

2788
02:08:34.990 --> 02:08:35.823
<v Speaker 8>as I recall,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you didn't really believe in the </v>

2789
02:08:37.991 --> 02:08:38.824
<v Speaker 8>moonlight.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't believe in it at all and then </v>

2790
02:08:39.851 --> 02:08:40.684
<v Speaker 8>you went through a phase because if the </v>
<v Speaker 8>podcast and having a lot of </v>

2791
02:08:43.691 --> 02:08:44.524
<v Speaker 8>conversations with different people or </v>
<v Speaker 8>something happened where you started </v>

2792
02:08:45.911 --> 02:08:49.030
<v Speaker 8>shifting your ideas and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we did go to the moon.</v>

2793
02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:50.133
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I started shifting my ideas about </v>

2794
02:08:50.921 --> 02:08:53.890
<v Speaker 8>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Or Moon landing is just an example.</v>

2795
02:08:53.891 --> 02:08:54.724
<v Speaker 8>That's an extreme example of a position </v>
<v Speaker 8>I took that I think represents there is </v>

2796
02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:00.220
<v Speaker 8>there is mystery to that story.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2797
02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:02.650
<v Speaker 8>There's a lot of mystery to that store </v>
<v Speaker 8>is still to this day.</v>

2798
02:09:02.770 --> 02:09:06.550
<v Speaker 8>There's a bunch of weird shit connected </v>
<v Speaker 8>to the moon landing a lot of it.</v>

2799
02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:08.080
<v Speaker 8>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and people are like,</v>

2800
02:09:08.081 --> 02:09:09.790
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's not shut up.</v>

2801
02:09:09.970 --> 02:09:10.840
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there is,</v>

2802
02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:11.763
<v Speaker 8>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a bunch of weird shit connected </v>

2803
02:09:13.001 --> 02:09:13.834
<v Speaker 8>to it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How about the fact that they give a </v>

2804
02:09:14.081 --> 02:09:17.470
<v Speaker 8>fucking moon rock to a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>was it the Prime Minister of Holland,</v>

2805
02:09:18.170 --> 02:09:19.003
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and </v>

2806
02:09:23.171 --> 02:09:28.060
<v Speaker 8>Michael Collins signed on this plaque </v>
<v Speaker 8>and they gave this moon rock to this guy</v>

2807
02:09:28.061 --> 02:09:31.210
<v Speaker 8>in Holland and it turned out to be </v>
<v Speaker 8>petrified wood.</v>

2808
02:09:31.810 --> 02:09:33.790
<v Speaker 8>It was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like it's,</v>

2809
02:09:33.970 --> 02:09:34.803
<v Speaker 8>there's so much weird shit connected to </v>
<v Speaker 8>the moon landing that it makes you go </v>

2810
02:09:37.541 --> 02:09:38.380
<v Speaker 8>like wow.</v>

2811
02:09:38.650 --> 02:09:41.680
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Creepy speeches that Neil Armstrong gave</v>

2812
02:09:41.681 --> 02:09:46.681
<v Speaker 8>25 years after the moon landing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about uncovering hidden truths,</v>

2813
02:09:46.820 --> 02:09:49.240
<v Speaker 8>patrice protective layers that are,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2814
02:09:49.900 --> 02:09:50.733
<v Speaker 8>oh great deeds that could be done to </v>
<v Speaker 8>those who could remove one of truth </v>

2815
02:09:53.471 --> 02:09:55.810
<v Speaker 8>protective layers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a speech that he gave.</v>

2816
02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:56.703
<v Speaker 8>There's so much weird shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Some people say there's alien relics as </v>

2817
02:10:00.250 --> 02:10:00.821
<v Speaker 8>people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Ridiculous.</v>

2818
02:10:00.821 --> 02:10:01.654
<v Speaker 8>There's no evidence to that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But there is evidence that these people </v>

2819
02:10:02.831 --> 02:10:04.590
<v Speaker 8>are talking really weird about the moon </v>
<v Speaker 8>landing.</v>

2820
02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:06.250
<v Speaker 8>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 8>can you peel a clean set?</v>

2821
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:07.383
<v Speaker 8>What Clinton said in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he wrote a book called my life and in </v>

2822
02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:10.893
<v Speaker 8>one of the chapters in my life he talks </v>
<v Speaker 8>about a conversation that he had been a </v>

2823
02:10:13.121 --> 02:10:14.980
<v Speaker 8>carpenter when people landed on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>moon.</v>

2824
02:10:14.981 --> 02:10:17.500
<v Speaker 8>He was working in a construction site </v>
<v Speaker 8>and the guy said,</v>

2825
02:10:17.501 --> 02:10:18.334
<v Speaker 8>I don't believe it for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Those television fellers they can fake </v>

2826
02:10:21.161 --> 02:10:21.851
<v Speaker 8>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He says.</v>

2827
02:10:21.851 --> 02:10:22.684
<v Speaker 8>Back then I thought the guy was a crank,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but after eight years in the White </v>

2828
02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:26.373
<v Speaker 8>House,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was starting to think that maybe he </v>

2829
02:10:26.981 --> 02:10:27.814
<v Speaker 8>was ahead of his time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now this is what bill fucking Clinton </v>

2830
02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:34.340
<v Speaker 8>wrote in his book,</v>
<v Speaker 8>my life.</v>

2831
02:10:34.490 --> 02:10:35.323
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would the fuck would you ever write </v>

2832
02:10:37.161 --> 02:10:40.370
<v Speaker 2>that if you were the God damn president </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the United States for eight years and</v>

2833
02:10:40.371 --> 02:10:40.941
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2834
02:10:40.941 --> 02:10:43.240
<v Speaker 2>maybe the guy who thought we didn't go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the moon was right,</v>

2835
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:45.133
<v Speaker 2>might not be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be that they faked some </v>

2836
02:10:47.841 --> 02:10:50.120
<v Speaker 2>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They did fake some photos.</v>

2837
02:10:50.121 --> 02:10:50.954
<v Speaker 2>There's a photo of micro Colin's who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a moonwalk from like Gemini 15 and </v>

2838
02:10:55.791 --> 02:10:56.624
<v Speaker 2>it's not a real photo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a photo of him from the test runs </v>

2839
02:10:59.311 --> 02:11:00.144
<v Speaker 2>that they did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in a warehouse and it blacked out </v>

2840
02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:04.130
<v Speaker 2>all the background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been proven.</v>

2841
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:07.100
<v Speaker 2>They reverse the image and blacked out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the background.</v>

2842
02:11:07.101 --> 02:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>You could see the two of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you overlay them line up perfectly,</v>

2843
02:11:10.851 --> 02:11:12.680
<v Speaker 2>it's the exact same image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2844
02:11:12.690 --> 02:11:14.900
<v Speaker 2>So someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it is a,</v>

2845
02:11:15.250 --> 02:11:16.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2846
02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:21.101
<v Speaker 2>an overzealous pr agent for NASA or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalist at the time who actually made</v>

2847
02:11:21.711 --> 02:11:22.544
<v Speaker 2>that photograph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but somebody did and tried to pass that </v>

2848
02:11:25.011 --> 02:11:26.240
<v Speaker 2>photo office space.</v>

2849
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:29.810
<v Speaker 2>So there's some deception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that one is 100% sure.</v>

2850
02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:30.673
<v Speaker 2>So then you look at the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the videos of guys falling </v>

2851
02:11:32.931 --> 02:11:33.764
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting yanked back up and the bouncing </v>

2852
02:11:35.541 --> 02:11:36.374
<v Speaker 2>around like they're on trampolines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some videos where they're hiding behind </v>

2853
02:11:38.481 --> 02:11:39.231
<v Speaker 2>the lunar rover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2854
02:11:39.231 --> 02:11:41.510
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you guys tear your suits,</v>

2855
02:11:41.511 --> 02:11:42.344
<v Speaker 2>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure you guys are jumping around on the </v>

2856
02:11:44.390 --> 02:11:45.650
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're having a party up there.</v>

2857
02:11:45.950 --> 02:11:47.610
<v Speaker 2>Is that real?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2858
02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:52.160
<v Speaker 2>How come I can't get a fucking regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>camera through the radar machine?</v>

2859
02:11:52.161 --> 02:11:52.994
<v Speaker 2>The extra mission at the airport?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you guys can fly through the </v>

2860
02:11:55.341 --> 02:11:57.830
<v Speaker 2>radiation of space and that should comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

2861
02:11:57.831 --> 02:11:59.570
<v Speaker 2>but what will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those cameras were insulated.</v>

2862
02:11:59.571 --> 02:12:02.450
<v Speaker 2>There were different kinds of camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The camera is not true.</v>

2863
02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Housel bad said it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were the same God damn cameras.</v>

2864
02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:06.710
<v Speaker 2>It's a regular camera.</v>

2865
02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:07.573
<v Speaker 2>There was no specific protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing unusual about the </v>

2866
02:12:09.891 --> 02:12:12.440
<v Speaker 2>protection that those cameras had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting,</v>

2867
02:12:12.441 --> 02:12:14.090
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've like gone back.</v>

2868
02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:15.313
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't.</v>

2869
02:12:15.380 --> 02:12:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing,</v>

2870
02:12:17.331 --> 02:12:18.890
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking any position.</v>

2871
02:12:18.891 --> 02:12:22.190
<v Speaker 2>You're agnostic 100% because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>know anything about space.</v>

2872
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about the physics </v>
<v Speaker 2>of space travel I go to,</v>

2873
02:12:25.491 --> 02:12:26.324
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirements of technological </v>

2874
02:12:27.681 --> 02:12:28.514
<v Speaker 2>requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do know it's one of the only </v>

2875
02:12:30.051 --> 02:12:33.800
<v Speaker 2>things that happened between 1969 in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1972 and it's not cheaper,</v>

2876
02:12:33.920 --> 02:12:36.870
<v Speaker 2>easier and faster to reproduce today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>

2877
02:12:36.940 --> 02:12:38.660
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird spent a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing.</v>

2878
02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:39.883
<v Speaker 2>This is the only time in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have been more than 400 miles </v>

2879
02:12:41.691 --> 02:12:43.820
<v Speaker 2>from the earth's surface was always moon</v>
<v Speaker 2>missions,</v>

2880
02:12:44.390 --> 02:12:45.620
<v Speaker 2>all the Apollo missions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2881
02:12:45.770 --> 02:12:46.603
<v Speaker 2>everything since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the space shuttle stuff inside 400 </v>

2882
02:12:48.771 --> 02:12:51.070
<v Speaker 2>miles satellites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2883
02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:52.190
<v Speaker 2>like a space station.</v>

2884
02:12:52.580 --> 02:12:54.690
<v Speaker 2>You talk to people about that part and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say like,</v>

2885
02:12:54.710 --> 02:12:56.510
<v Speaker 2>we just don't need to go there anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we don't.</v>

2886
02:12:56.540 --> 02:12:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they're right.</v>

2887
02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:00.020
<v Speaker 2>They might be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

2888
02:13:00.021 --> 02:13:01.490
<v Speaker 2>But it's juicy to think they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2889
02:13:01.580 --> 02:13:05.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's interesting how rapidly people </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight off the notion.</v>

2890
02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Here's the other weird shit about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nazis were running our space program.</v>

2891
02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:12.410
<v Speaker 2>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Operation Paperclip,</v>

2892
02:13:12.411 --> 02:13:13.244
<v Speaker 2>Varun Navon promise a fucking Nazi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought all the scientists over </v>

2893
02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:16.993
<v Speaker 2>like legit Nazis who would hang Jews in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of their fucking rocket factories </v>

2894
02:13:19.941 --> 02:13:22.250
<v Speaker 2>in Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Git guys who were,</v>

2895
02:13:22.340 --> 02:13:23.173
<v Speaker 2>we're tattoos from the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>identified Wernher von Braun talked </v>

2896
02:13:26.271 --> 02:13:28.610
<v Speaker 2>about him being in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the head of NASA.</v>

2897
02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:30.200
<v Speaker 2>That was the guy who was trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>us to the moon.</v>

2898
02:13:30.380 --> 02:13:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2899
02:13:31.321 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of</v>

2900
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:34.470
<v Speaker 3>weird shit and now you're getting deep</v>

2901
02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:35.353
<v Speaker 5>bend to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the Nazis doing some kind of thing </v>

2902
02:13:38.061 --> 02:13:38.894
<v Speaker 5>where they're like trying to fake the </v>
<v Speaker 5>moon landing like at some out get to </v>

2903
02:13:41.301 --> 02:13:42.800
<v Speaker 5>attach to the Nazis.</v>

2904
02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:47.340
<v Speaker 3>I think the Nazis were the best rocket </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists available.</v>

2905
02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:48.293
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or one of them other than the ones that </v>

2906
02:13:49.261 --> 02:13:50.820
<v Speaker 3>we had here and then the ones the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Russians had,</v>

2907
02:13:50.821 --> 02:13:51.654
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of competition to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best rocket scientists but some of </v>

2908
02:13:53.761 --> 02:13:55.800
<v Speaker 3>the best rocket scientists were in Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms.</v>

2909
02:13:55.801 --> 02:13:57.570
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when Nazi Germany fell,</v>

2910
02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.650
<v Speaker 3>operation paperclip took place and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Operation Operation Paperclip,</v>

2911
02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:06.420
<v Speaker 3>they brought a number of Nazi scientists</v>
<v Speaker 3>from Germany secretly to America.</v>

2912
02:14:06.421 --> 02:14:08.580
<v Speaker 3>And one of them they put as a head of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking NASA.</v>

2913
02:14:09.050 --> 02:14:09.940
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is where the,</v>

2914
02:14:09.941 --> 02:14:10.774
<v Speaker 5>this is where it gets really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Someone was explaining all this to me </v>

2915
02:14:12.381 --> 02:14:15.470
<v Speaker 5>about how basically it's the thing is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2916
02:14:15.471 --> 02:14:16.304
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you think in World War II that we just </v>

2917
02:14:18.531 --> 02:14:22.100
<v Speaker 5>rounded up all the Nazis and they just </v>
<v Speaker 5>disappeared.</v>

2918
02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:25.220
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what do you think are the Nazis went and</v>

2919
02:14:25.250 --> 02:14:26.083
<v Speaker 5>they bought the ones who were really </v>
<v Speaker 5>good at making cool shit yet we'll bear </v>

2920
02:14:28.941 --> 02:14:29.960
<v Speaker 5>aspirin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2921
02:14:29.961 --> 02:14:31.910
<v Speaker 5>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea is that the nar aspirin.</v>

2922
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.863
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well look up.</v>

2923
02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:33.713
<v Speaker 5>I'm so sorry to ask Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but do you mind looking up bear as </v>

2924
02:14:35.631 --> 02:14:38.640
<v Speaker 5>brandon psych on be like and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

2925
02:14:38.650 --> 02:14:40.160
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the Jewish slaves?</v>

2926
02:14:40.220 --> 02:14:41.053
<v Speaker 5>I think working for bare aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but when you look at like a lot of the </v>

2927
02:14:43.311 --> 02:14:45.830
<v Speaker 5>core,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea is that the Nazis didn't really</v>

2928
02:14:45.831 --> 02:14:46.664
<v Speaker 5>go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just started corporations and some </v>

2929
02:14:49.041 --> 02:14:50.930
<v Speaker 5>of the biggest corporations we have </v>
<v Speaker 5>right now.</v>

2930
02:14:50.931 --> 02:14:51.220
<v Speaker 5>Or</v>

2931
02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:52.053
<v Speaker 3>do you know why Zyklon B is I clumby </v>
<v Speaker 3>because icon beat took the smell out of </v>

2932
02:14:55.751 --> 02:14:58.300
<v Speaker 3>it is I climb a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the stuff that had a sea,</v>

2933
02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.510
<v Speaker 3>an agent in it that made it smelled </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible so you could smell.</v>

2934
02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:05.800
<v Speaker 3>So when they used it to gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people in the concentration camps,</v>

2935
02:15:06.190 --> 02:15:09.100
<v Speaker 3>they changed it so that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>undetectable.</v>

2936
02:15:09.970 --> 02:15:10.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did,</v>

2937
02:15:10.491 --> 02:15:11.230
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would it say?</v>

2938
02:15:11.230 --> 02:15:12.063
<v Speaker 3>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie is quick with the trigger here </v>

2939
02:15:13.121 --> 02:15:13.954
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting frustrated with us changes the </v>

2940
02:15:15.341 --> 02:15:16.174
<v Speaker 3>camera.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you guys aren't the Bayer Aspirin </v>

2941
02:15:17.561 --> 02:15:18.394
<v Speaker 3>company is finally apologize for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhumane acts of its parent from </v>

2942
02:15:21.491 --> 02:15:24.790
<v Speaker 3>including using Jewish slave laborers </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the Holocaust.</v>

2943
02:15:24.791 --> 02:15:26.380
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2944
02:15:26.990 --> 02:15:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2945
02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:28.433
<v Speaker 5>And there's all kinds of examples of </v>
<v Speaker 5>this and where it gets really weird is </v>

2946
02:15:31.301 --> 02:15:32.134
<v Speaker 5>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is one of the great conspiracy </v>

2947
02:15:33.701 --> 02:15:36.680
<v Speaker 5>theories is I think the Bush family is </v>
<v Speaker 5>somehow wrapped up in it.</v>

2948
02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:38.740
<v Speaker 5>That's where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like the,</v>

2949
02:15:38.920 --> 02:15:41.350
<v Speaker 5>it ends up getting wrapped into American</v>
<v Speaker 5>politics.</v>

2950
02:15:41.351 --> 02:15:42.131
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2951
02:15:42.131 --> 02:15:45.550
<v Speaker 5>do you think that the Nazis just became </v>
<v Speaker 5>rocket scientists?</v>

2952
02:15:45.551 --> 02:15:48.970
<v Speaker 5>Do you think they just know they became </v>
<v Speaker 5>pharmacists,</v>

2953
02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:53.560
<v Speaker 5>pharmacists and they started running the</v>
<v Speaker 5>companies and corporations and then like</v>

2954
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:54.663
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're still here and their </v>

2955
02:15:55.991 --> 02:15:56.824
<v Speaker 5>descendants have lots of money and like </v>
<v Speaker 5>to think that they went anywhere is </v>

2956
02:16:00.281 --> 02:16:02.320
<v Speaker 5>nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Nazis didn't really go anywhere.</v>

2957
02:16:02.530 --> 02:16:03.363
<v Speaker 5>They just went deep into hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just sink back into the immune </v>

2958
02:16:06.431 --> 02:16:09.640
<v Speaker 5>system of society.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you know like the way aids hides in</v>

2959
02:16:09.641 --> 02:16:13.630
<v Speaker 5>different parts of your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just hid in the shadows.</v>

2960
02:16:13.631 --> 02:16:14.464
<v Speaker 5>And this is one of the reasons people </v>
<v Speaker 5>are freaking out about the kind of like </v>

2961
02:16:17.590 --> 02:16:18.423
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>friendly emergence of some people who </v>

2962
02:16:20.891 --> 02:16:21.724
<v Speaker 5>are like clearly white nationalists who </v>
<v Speaker 5>are just kind of like being like </v>

2963
02:16:25.150 --> 02:16:27.850
<v Speaker 5>interestingly accepted and embraced for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2964
02:16:27.851 --> 02:16:29.950
<v Speaker 5>what's at least have a rational about</v>

2965
02:16:30.250 --> 02:16:32.320
<v Speaker 4>how you want to start a white ethno </v>
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>

2966
02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:34.180
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff because it,</v>

2967
02:16:34.181 --> 02:16:35.410
<v Speaker 4>who's doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2968
02:16:35.411 --> 02:16:36.244
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't this something Richard Spencer </v>

2969
02:16:36.911 --> 02:16:39.370
<v Speaker 4>talks about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but who's taking that guy and talking to</v>

2970
02:16:39.371 --> 02:16:40.210
<v Speaker 4>them rationally?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2971
02:16:40.211 --> 02:16:42.700
<v Speaker 4>there's these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these people are getting like a</v>

2972
02:16:42.701 --> 02:16:43.534
<v Speaker 4>lot of airtime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think this is a bit of an </v>

2973
02:16:45.251 --> 02:16:45.941
<v Speaker 4>exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

2974
02:16:45.941 --> 02:16:46.774
<v Speaker 4>maybe we're talking about Steve Bannon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve Bannon got into the White House </v>

2975
02:16:48.491 --> 02:16:50.350
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of people state their name is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he has,</v>

2976
02:16:50.351 --> 02:16:51.550
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>has it been proven,</v>

2977
02:16:51.610 --> 02:16:54.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's really easy to call a guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and a white nationalists.</v>

2978
02:16:54.520 --> 02:16:56.490
<v Speaker 4>Has it been proven?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know much about Steve Bannon.</v>

2979
02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:57.353
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>

2980
02:16:57.610 --> 02:16:58.630
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2981
02:16:58.660 --> 02:17:00.000
<v Speaker 4>I think some of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2982
02:17:00.010 --> 02:17:01.270
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2983
02:17:01.271 --> 02:17:03.280
<v Speaker 4>you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get like a fucking,</v>

2984
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:07.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get like an avalanche of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're a fucking guy,</v>

2985
02:17:08.710 --> 02:17:10.090
<v Speaker 4>tuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tuck Kami.</v>

2986
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.983
<v Speaker 4>But I think like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at trump's reaction when </v>

2987
02:17:13.031 --> 02:17:15.910
<v Speaker 4>they were saying asking about the KKK </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like,</v>

2988
02:17:15.911 --> 02:17:17.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to talk shit about this </v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

2989
02:17:17.411 --> 02:17:19.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't really know him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that like,</v>

2990
02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:21.900
<v Speaker 4>or the fact that a lot of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're paraphrasing.</v>

2991
02:17:21.980 --> 02:17:22.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2992
02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:24.150
<v Speaker 4>I think what he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2993
02:17:24.310 --> 02:17:27.190
<v Speaker 4>a little more acceptable but still </v>
<v Speaker 4>weird.</v>

2994
02:17:27.191 --> 02:17:29.350
<v Speaker 4>Can we look at it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a little tip telling.</v>

2995
02:17:29.351 --> 02:17:31.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like if someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey Kay,</v>

2996
02:17:31.191 --> 02:17:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Kay Kay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>

2997
02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:34.810
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's also said something about there was</v>

2998
02:17:35.020 --> 02:17:37.900
<v Speaker 4>people bad behavior on all sides,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on all sides.</v>

2999
02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:38.853
<v Speaker 4>And that's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the white nationalist groups </v>

3000
02:17:40.241 --> 02:17:41.074
<v Speaker 4>picked up on that and said specifically </v>
<v Speaker 4>that trump didn't criticize them </v>

3001
02:17:45.041 --> 02:17:47.050
<v Speaker 4>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this was a good thing.</v>

3002
02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:47.913
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing was very good for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a white nationalist groups </v>

3003
02:17:50.151 --> 02:17:50.984
<v Speaker 4>said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that could have been just him just </v>

3004
02:17:54.461 --> 02:17:57.310
<v Speaker 4>not doing a good job preparing.</v>

3005
02:17:57.340 --> 02:17:59.440
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to say about </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and talking off the cuff,</v>

3006
02:17:59.441 --> 02:18:00.274
<v Speaker 4>which I think he does with most things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that guy does most of his shit </v>

3007
02:18:03.071 --> 02:18:04.450
<v Speaker 4>off the cuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3008
02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:04.781
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3009
02:18:04.781 --> 02:18:06.700
<v Speaker 4>he said that and one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

3010
02:18:06.701 --> 02:18:08.620
<v Speaker 4>but in the wrote that book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the art of the deal,</v>

3011
02:18:08.710 --> 02:18:10.840
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't make plans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just goes,</v>

3012
02:18:10.930 --> 02:18:13.210
<v Speaker 4>it just goes to work and gets things </v>
<v Speaker 4>done and just work.</v>

3013
02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:14.740
<v Speaker 4>Work off of instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3014
02:18:15.010 --> 02:18:15.843
<v Speaker 4>The thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's generally like when you think of </v>

3015
02:18:17.321 --> 02:18:18.610
<v Speaker 4>certain people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3016
02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:22.630
<v Speaker 4>Are they a white nationalist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when I think of you Joe,</v>

3017
02:18:22.631 --> 02:18:24.520
<v Speaker 4>are you a white nationalist?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3018
02:18:24.910 --> 02:18:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's simple.</v>

3019
02:18:26.921 --> 02:18:28.720
<v Speaker 4>It's simple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's no like,</v>

3020
02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:30.430
<v Speaker 4>well you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even a nationalist,</v>

3021
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:32.740
<v Speaker 4>I love America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not a nationalist.</v>

3022
02:18:32.770 --> 02:18:34.180
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3023
02:18:34.300 --> 02:18:37.900
<v Speaker 4>So the problem is with some white what </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't want.</v>

3024
02:18:37.950 --> 02:18:42.640
<v Speaker 4>This is one thing I don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want there to be a blurry thing.</v>

3025
02:18:42.641 --> 02:18:45.560
<v Speaker 4>When people think of me about whether or</v>
<v Speaker 4>not I'm a white nationalist,</v>

3026
02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:47.710
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't want there to be a like,</v>

3027
02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:48.693
<v Speaker 4>well maybe he does have some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas that are based around the </v>

3028
02:18:52.361 --> 02:18:56.530
<v Speaker 4>importance of upholding European culture</v>
<v Speaker 4>and making sure that we do everything we</v>

3029
02:18:56.531 --> 02:19:01.270
<v Speaker 4>can to prevent people from having sex </v>
<v Speaker 4>with people from other races.</v>

3030
02:19:01.450 --> 02:19:02.283
<v Speaker 4>I don't want there to be any question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I have zero problem with </v>

3031
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:09.063
<v Speaker 4>everyone humping everybody whenever they</v>
<v Speaker 4>want mixing the Paints and doing </v>

3032
02:19:13.331 --> 02:19:14.880
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is no question.</v>

3033
02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:17.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think it's fine.</v>

3034
02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:19.720
<v Speaker 4>Whereas some sounds like what a racist </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say.</v>

3035
02:19:19.870 --> 02:19:20.703
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Trying to like divert attention away </v>

3036
02:19:22.061 --> 02:19:23.500
<v Speaker 4>from your racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

3037
02:19:23.501 --> 02:19:25.540
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck you're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see what you're doing,</v>

3038
02:19:25.541 --> 02:19:27.650
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is virtue signaling but virtue.</v>

3039
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:28.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3040
02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:30.110
<v Speaker 3>do me a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate to dwell on this one more time,</v>

3041
02:19:30.111 --> 02:19:30.944
<v Speaker 3>but you please go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure I'm right about </v>

3042
02:19:31.701 --> 02:19:32.534
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the hassle bad cameras from the </v>

3043
02:19:33.831 --> 02:19:35.930
<v Speaker 3>moon landing weren't insulated in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>bizarre way.</v>

3044
02:19:36.430 --> 02:19:39.380
<v Speaker 3>See that up there are set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were different cameras.</v>

3045
02:19:39.381 --> 02:19:42.050
<v Speaker 3>They were mates a specialty while they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were made for this chest thing.</v>

3046
02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:42.933
<v Speaker 3>They also had a special special film </v>
<v Speaker 3>developed developed by Kodak Special </v>

3047
02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:48.531
<v Speaker 3>Film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that true?</v>

3048
02:19:48.531 --> 02:19:50.240
<v Speaker 3>Because I read that it was exact same </v>
<v Speaker 3>film.</v>

3049
02:19:50.890 --> 02:19:53.420
<v Speaker 3>Who but who says it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who says it has a big breakdown?</v>

3050
02:19:53.421 --> 02:19:54.710
<v Speaker 3>I'd look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had a pixel,</v>

3051
02:19:54.711 --> 02:19:55.544
<v Speaker 3>which is a big cause too many fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's too many different people </v>

3052
02:19:58.041 --> 02:20:00.380
<v Speaker 3>commenting on it that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like me,</v>

3053
02:20:00.470 --> 02:20:01.303
<v Speaker 3>like I'm muddying the waters myself by </v>
<v Speaker 3>not exactly knowing what the fuck I'm </v>

3054
02:20:03.861 --> 02:20:04.910
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well Dude,</v>

3055
02:20:04.911 --> 02:20:05.744
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at the camera or behind the </v>

3056
02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.780
<v Speaker 3>historic w what is this?</v>

3057
02:20:08.960 --> 02:20:10.010
<v Speaker 3>Who wrote this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had a pixel.</v>

3058
02:20:10.011 --> 02:20:12.830
<v Speaker 3>This is a pretty well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fucking shell to shell site.</v>

3059
02:20:12.831 --> 02:20:15.800
<v Speaker 3>This is CIA front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even the shadows,</v>

3060
02:20:15.801 --> 02:20:17.390
<v Speaker 3>the lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lighting.</v>

3061
02:20:17.391 --> 02:20:19.670
<v Speaker 3>Why is it so well lit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in the shadows.</v>

3062
02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:20.663
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy behind it with one of </v>

3063
02:20:21.501 --> 02:20:25.640
<v Speaker 3>those big reflector booms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is on in Nevada.</v>

3064
02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:28.580
<v Speaker 3>There's a tarp back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3065
02:20:28.581 --> 02:20:29.900
<v Speaker 3>if you look real close,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

3066
02:20:29.901 --> 02:20:31.370
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see gum wrappers,</v>

3067
02:20:31.371 --> 02:20:32.000
<v Speaker 3>films,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

3068
02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.250
<v Speaker 3>look at all that gum wrapper and fake </v>
<v Speaker 3>round.</v>

3069
02:20:34.340 --> 02:20:36.470
<v Speaker 3>We've got fake that ground looks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no man,</v>

3070
02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:37.910
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at it.</v>

3071
02:20:37.911 --> 02:20:40.650
<v Speaker 3>Shitty tin foil on that spaceship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3072
02:20:40.651 --> 02:20:42.710
<v Speaker 3>super likely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That just landed on the moon.</v>

3073
02:20:43.430 --> 02:20:46.280
<v Speaker 3>It's just more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why I abandoned the idea that we</v>

3074
02:20:46.281 --> 02:20:49.340
<v Speaker 3>didn't go to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more fun to think that we didn't go</v>

3075
02:20:49.341 --> 02:20:50.870
<v Speaker 3>to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more exciting.</v>

3076
02:20:50.990 --> 02:20:53.570
<v Speaker 3>So I have to be careful going that way.</v>

3077
02:20:53.900 --> 02:20:56.150
<v Speaker 3>That's why I changed my opinion on it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because then I started really looking at</v>

3078
02:20:56.151 --> 02:20:56.984
<v Speaker 3>him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck do you know about space </v>

3079
02:20:58.221 --> 02:20:59.600
<v Speaker 3>travel?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost zero.</v>

3080
02:20:59.720 --> 02:21:01.820
<v Speaker 3>But what do you know about bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I'm the law.</v>

3081
02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:03.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know about bullshit.</v>

3082
02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:05.450
<v Speaker 3>And when I watched that press </v>
<v Speaker 3>conference,</v>

3083
02:21:05.451 --> 02:21:07.730
<v Speaker 3>the Post Apollo 11 press conference of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike's Samoans,</v>

3084
02:21:07.731 --> 02:21:10.310
<v Speaker 3>but bullshit shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's weird here.</v>

3085
02:21:10.640 --> 02:21:15.170
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's entirely possible that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were forced into,</v>

3086
02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:16.033
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accepting some stuff that wasn't real </v>

3087
02:21:18.171 --> 02:21:19.004
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kind of knew it,</v>

3088
02:21:19.430 --> 02:21:21.140
<v Speaker 3>but that they probably did go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moon.</v>

3089
02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:22.053
<v Speaker 3>I probably don't understand how you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like get back and forth in your </v>

3090
02:21:24.921 --> 02:21:25.754
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I say alien artifacts on the moon </v>

3091
02:21:27.231 --> 02:21:27.890
<v Speaker 3>right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3092
02:21:27.890 --> 02:21:29.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they leave shit behind.</v>

3093
02:21:29.720 --> 02:21:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I think if they're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they uh,</v>

3094
02:21:31.101 --> 02:21:31.934
<v Speaker 3>they clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you not seen the clean up fucking </v>

3095
02:21:36.730 --> 02:21:37.563
<v Speaker 3>rack?</v>

3096
02:21:37.810 --> 02:21:38.643
<v Speaker 3>There's a division of alien.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No evidence they'll look the face on </v>

3097
02:21:40.461 --> 02:21:42.440
<v Speaker 3>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've looked at women really well.</v>

3098
02:21:42.860 --> 02:21:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Picture of that space ship that crashed </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the moon.</v>

3099
02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

3100
02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:48.470
<v Speaker 3>That shit looks crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of a real,</v>

3101
02:21:48.750 --> 02:21:50.930
<v Speaker 3>I like to think that you space ships.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they get to a certain point,</v>

3102
02:21:50.931 --> 02:21:52.850
<v Speaker 3>they just traveled through dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

3103
02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:53.913
<v Speaker 3>But think of that more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think spaceships exist other </v>

3104
02:21:55.941 --> 02:21:59.720
<v Speaker 3>than like the really crude civilizations</v>
<v Speaker 3>like are relatively,</v>

3105
02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:00.793
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's super real.</v>

3106
02:22:00.890 --> 02:22:04.340
<v Speaker 3>Which one do you mean it's most drawn </v>
<v Speaker 3>with crayons?</v>

3107
02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:07.220
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's roaming.</v>

3108
02:22:07.221 --> 02:22:08.620
<v Speaker 3>That's an episode of Star Trek,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

3109
02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:09.503
<v Speaker 3>That looks like a ship,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the eyes of a mountain line behind </v>

3110
02:22:11.751 --> 02:22:12.351
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

3111
02:22:12.351 --> 02:22:13.184
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The eyes look at this is a fucking </v>

3112
02:22:15.021 --> 02:22:15.854
<v Speaker 3>volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3113
02:22:17.490 --> 02:22:19.790
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking topographical map.</v>

3114
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:24.020
<v Speaker 3>That's you're isolating a tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 3>area and you're choosing to look at it.</v>

3115
02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:25.500
<v Speaker 3>You got to ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you.</v>

3116
02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:26.513
<v Speaker 3>You could look at anything in Moab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Utah and decided that that's a space </v>

3117
02:22:28.881 --> 02:22:32.280
<v Speaker 3>ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why they don't want to go to the</v>

3118
02:22:32.281 --> 02:22:34.500
<v Speaker 3>middle ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the fucking ground.</v>

3119
02:22:34.501 --> 02:22:36.180
<v Speaker 3>There's a hole in the ground that's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>ship.</v>

3120
02:22:36.210 --> 02:22:38.340
<v Speaker 3>It's not a ship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And look at that trail.</v>

3121
02:22:38.341 --> 02:22:41.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like a bobsled trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what's interesting?</v>

3122
02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:45.480
<v Speaker 3>We look for Shit on the moon or in space</v>
<v Speaker 3>in general,</v>

3123
02:22:45.600 --> 02:22:48.780
<v Speaker 3>and a normal thing in space is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

3124
02:22:48.781 --> 02:22:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Like if we find a microbe on the desert </v>
<v Speaker 3>floor,</v>

3125
02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.180
<v Speaker 3>no one gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh look,</v>

3126
02:22:53.181 --> 02:22:55.140
<v Speaker 3>your lives in the sand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

3127
02:22:55.230 --> 02:22:56.063
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's going to pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you find something in space and </v>

3128
02:22:58.171 --> 02:23:01.590
<v Speaker 3>you can prove that this thing exists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a living organism,</v>

3129
02:23:01.770 --> 02:23:02.603
<v Speaker 3>a primitive organism that's on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we know that some life existed on </v>

3130
02:23:05.881 --> 02:23:06.960
<v Speaker 3>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3131
02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:08.093
<v Speaker 3>And then take it another step further.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you ran into some dude who was </v>

3132
02:23:10.651 --> 02:23:11.484
<v Speaker 3>jerking off in your apartment building,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just open the open the wrong door </v>

3133
02:23:14.551 --> 02:23:17.130
<v Speaker 3>and some dudes in there jerking off and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's screaming and he's an old man.</v>

3134
02:23:17.131 --> 02:23:20.220
<v Speaker 3>He's got a tank top on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck can you tell your friends?</v>

3135
02:23:20.221 --> 02:23:23.580
<v Speaker 3>We'd laugh at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you found that guy on the moon to</v>

3136
02:23:23.581 --> 02:23:27.960
<v Speaker 3>some old Dude Jurgen off on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if that's what we found.</v>

3137
02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:29.670
<v Speaker 3>I went to anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go crazy.</v>

3138
02:23:29.700 --> 02:23:30.533
<v Speaker 3>Realize you realize like like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We literally are in a simulation and </v>

3139
02:23:33.301 --> 02:23:34.134
<v Speaker 3>this is how we find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy on the moon jacking off </v>

3140
02:23:36.030 --> 02:23:40.350
<v Speaker 3>and he's got boxer shorts on and socks </v>
<v Speaker 3>with crocs and he's just sitting there.</v>

3141
02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:41.940
<v Speaker 3>He's probably knuckles up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3142
02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:42.953
<v Speaker 3>He's sitting there with a hunchback </v>
<v Speaker 3>knuckling up on the moon and he got </v>

3143
02:23:46.271 --> 02:23:48.510
<v Speaker 3>dirt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's got mouthfuls a dirt.</v>

3144
02:23:48.510 --> 02:23:51.060
<v Speaker 3>That's how he gets by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the creator of the universe.</v>

3145
02:23:51.061 --> 02:23:54.000
<v Speaker 3>He's just gone crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The creator of the universe went insane.</v>

3146
02:23:54.180 --> 02:23:56.240
<v Speaker 3>Now he just jerks off on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3147
02:23:56.250 --> 02:23:58.130
<v Speaker 3>it's an old man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks just like an old man.</v>

3148
02:23:58.131 --> 02:24:00.420
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe is so infinite.</v>

3149
02:24:00.630 --> 02:24:03.840
<v Speaker 3>There's an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities that lives can exist.</v>

3150
02:24:03.841 --> 02:24:05.280
<v Speaker 3>Like someone's explaining this the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

3151
02:24:05.490 --> 02:24:10.380
<v Speaker 3>that the infinite is so vast that </v>
<v Speaker 3>literally it's entirely possible.</v>

3152
02:24:10.381 --> 02:24:11.214
<v Speaker 3>There is a darth vader somewhere like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real legit darth vader who runs an </v>

3153
02:24:14.311 --> 02:24:16.260
<v Speaker 3>empire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's real thing somewhere.</v>

3154
02:24:16.350 --> 02:24:19.320
<v Speaker 3>That's how many possibilities exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if that's the case,</v>

3155
02:24:19.530 --> 02:24:23.040
<v Speaker 3>why can't there be a possibility on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moon of an old dude who eats dirt?</v>

3156
02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:25.470
<v Speaker 3>He's got a tank top and spaghetti stains</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

3157
02:24:25.471 --> 02:24:27.880
<v Speaker 3>He's knuckling up on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

3158
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We find them.</v>

3159
02:24:29.341 --> 02:24:31.620
<v Speaker 3>We have to film them front page of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>New York Times.</v>

3160
02:24:31.621 --> 02:24:33.300
<v Speaker 3>They found an old manager and off of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>moon.</v>

3161
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:36.420
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they tell us if they found </v>
<v Speaker 3>an old man jerking off in the moon?</v>

3162
02:24:36.421 --> 02:24:37.254
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's what they find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the space probe lands and then </v>

3163
02:24:39.541 --> 02:24:43.080
<v Speaker 3>right in front of it's like fucking look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at this guy's great ball hair.</v>

3164
02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:47.130
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd love see this left press conference,</v>

3165
02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:51.920
<v Speaker 3>half his guts hanging out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spaghetti stains all.</v>

3166
02:24:51.930 --> 02:24:53.940
<v Speaker 3>How do you give it spaghetti stains on </v>
<v Speaker 3>his shirt and no one knows.</v>

3167
02:24:53.941 --> 02:24:57.300
<v Speaker 3>No one knows he's eaten dirt on the moon</v>
<v Speaker 3>jerking off on the probes.</v>

3168
02:24:57.301 --> 02:24:58.260
<v Speaker 3>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now?</v>

3169
02:24:58.261 --> 02:25:00.780
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is our civilization to,</v>

3170
02:25:00.781 --> 02:25:02.130
<v Speaker 3>how do we deal with this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3171
02:25:02.131 --> 02:25:05.100
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this a elon musk car in space.</v>

3172
02:25:05.101 --> 02:25:08.490
<v Speaker 3>It's like you see the image of that car </v>
<v Speaker 3>flying through sprint.</v>

3173
02:25:08.491 --> 02:25:09.091
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

3174
02:25:09.091 --> 02:25:09.591
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

3175
02:25:09.591 --> 02:25:12.070
<v Speaker 3>is this real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this really going on or am I in it?</v>

3176
02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:13.180
<v Speaker 3>Goddamn movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3177
02:25:13.230 --> 02:25:14.063
<v Speaker 3>Like what's happening here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just got to really spend $100 </v>

3178
02:25:15.690 --> 02:25:18.510
<v Speaker 3>million a shoot a car and it space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is this?</v>

3179
02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:20.060
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got a camera on it.</v>

3180
02:25:20.090 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>It's broadcasting images of a mannequin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Find what the fuck is going</v>

3181
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:24.610
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3182
02:25:24.610 --> 02:25:27.220
<v Speaker 4>Cascading levels of absurdity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's happening.</v>

3183
02:25:27.221 --> 02:25:31.200
<v Speaker 4>We're seeing cascading levels of </v>
<v Speaker 4>absurdity and like the more that it,</v>

3184
02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:34.660
<v Speaker 4>the more that absurdity happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more normal it seems.</v>

3185
02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:36.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's kind of I,</v>

3186
02:25:36.041 --> 02:25:38.620
<v Speaker 4>this is what I've been thinking is like </v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3187
02:25:38.650 --> 02:25:39.483
<v Speaker 4>what the apocalypse really looks like </v>
<v Speaker 4>because everybody thinks when you think </v>

3188
02:25:42.281 --> 02:25:45.010
<v Speaker 4>about the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I think about the apocalypse,</v>

3189
02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:47.290
<v Speaker 4>I think of media,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yours,</v>

3190
02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:49.510
<v Speaker 4>volcanoes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>But really it's like more like absurdity</v>

3193
02:25:57.821 --> 02:25:58.654
<v Speaker 4>starts avalanching into time to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>point where things start happening so </v>

3194
02:26:03.311 --> 02:26:04.144
<v Speaker 4>quickly that we can't even catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like now we gotta deal with the fact </v>

3195
02:26:07.091 --> 02:26:10.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a fucking tesla infinitely </v>
<v Speaker 4>flying through space.</v>

3196
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:13.270
<v Speaker 4>If it slams into a spaceship that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming to visit us,</v>

<v Speaker 8>speed and then the moment they read </v>

3200
02:26:28.201 --> 02:26:31.950
<v Speaker 8>merged from lightspeed,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tesla comes through the windshield,</v>

3201
02:26:31.951 --> 02:26:32.784
<v Speaker 8>hits him right in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 8>takes the head off the emperor and it's </v>

3202
02:26:35.430 --> 02:26:37.920
<v Speaker 8>just fucked.</v>

<v Speaker 8>That's what happened in the new star </v>
<v Speaker 8>wars movie.</v>

3207
02:26:47.341 --> 02:26:49.770
<v Speaker 8>Spoiler alert.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Remember when they hit warp speed,</v>

3208
02:26:49.771 --> 02:26:51.810
<v Speaker 8>they went right through that one jet or </v>
<v Speaker 8>that one.</v>

02:26:52.270 --> 02:26:53.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

3210

3240
02:28:14.450 --> 02:28:15.283
<v Speaker 2>They sent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the earth got hit by that one that </v>

3241
02:28:16.671 --> 02:28:17.504
<v Speaker 2>hit the Yucatan 65 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it rang for a million years just to </v>

3242
02:28:22.431 --> 02:28:27.320
<v Speaker 2>drown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like it got cracked like a gong for</v>

3243
02:28:27.321 --> 02:28:31.910
<v Speaker 2>a million years do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>

3244
02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:32.863
<v Speaker 2>You ever heard the descriptions of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>deep they think that thing was in the </v>

3245
02:28:35.991 --> 02:28:39.140
<v Speaker 2>earth within the first second of impact?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3246
02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:40.453
<v Speaker 2>It's something bananas like a miles deep</v>
<v Speaker 2>into the earth within the first second </v>

3247
02:28:44.451 --> 02:28:45.284
<v Speaker 2>of impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how big that thing was called </v>

3248
02:28:47.991 --> 02:28:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan size chunk.</v>

3249

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3250
02:28:51.771 --> 02:28:54.800
<v Speaker 4>I love that because that's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that funny?</v>

3251
02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:55.753
<v Speaker 4>That's the funny thing about existing on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the planet is because everybody walks </v>

3252
02:28:58.701 --> 02:29:03.701
<v Speaker 4>around imagining that the world that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're living in is permanent,</v>

3253
02:29:03.890 --> 02:29:07.100
<v Speaker 4>permanent and stable and not just our </v>
<v Speaker 4>world aren't just society,</v>

3254
02:29:07.101 --> 02:29:07.934
<v Speaker 4>but your own life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like people walk around through their </v>

3255
02:29:10.431 --> 02:29:11.264
<v Speaker 4>own fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the thing I was thinking about </v>

3256
02:29:12.651 --> 02:29:13.730
<v Speaker 4>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that terrible.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It keeps happening but the Amtrak train </v>
<v Speaker 4>crash.</v>

3258
02:29:16.191 --> 02:29:17.024
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's like when you think about </v>

3259
02:29:18.441 --> 02:29:21.260
<v Speaker 4>that you're just going to work.</v>

3260
02:29:21.730 --> 02:29:22.563
<v Speaker 2>Why do you use it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing that disturbed me the </v>

<v Speaker 2>most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this disturbed me a lot lately.</v>

3262
02:29:26.140 --> 02:29:31.140
<v Speaker 2>This is a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that were on the left were saying</v>

3263
02:29:32.681 --> 02:29:33.514
<v Speaker 2>that they were happy that it happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that God had done something to kill </v>

3264
02:29:37.121 --> 02:29:39.370
<v Speaker 2>these politicians because there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of right wing.</v>

3265
02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:40.233
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>G O p people that were on his Amtrak </v>

3268
02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:48.370
<v Speaker 2>not only thinking it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but saying it on twitter,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like you're so confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show your righteous with your desire to </v>

3270

<v Speaker 2>fucking train accident.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like somebody died in that accident and </v>

3272
02:29:59.321 --> 02:30:00.450
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck down.</v>

3278
02:30:15.250 --> 02:30:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause they're on the other team.</v>

3279
02:30:16.990 --> 02:30:17.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

02:30:17.461 --> 02:30:20.680
<v Speaker 2>that shit does terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit's really sad.</v>

3281
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:23.560
<v Speaker 2>But it never used to be the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's the scariest thing to me.</v>

3282
02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:26.140
<v Speaker 2>The left was never like advocating </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>

3283
02:30:26.141 --> 02:30:27.960
<v Speaker 2>They were the exact opposite during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit,</v>

3284
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.380
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Vietnam War,</v>

3285
02:30:29.530 --> 02:30:30.363
<v Speaker 2>they were the hippies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were the people that wanted to </v>

3286
02:30:31.451 --> 02:30:33.400
<v Speaker 2>bring the troops home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the people that didn't want war.</v>

3287
02:30:33.401 --> 02:30:35.200
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to hate.</v>

3288
02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:37.540
<v Speaker 2>They denounce tate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're,</v>

3289
02:30:37.541 --> 02:30:38.374
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like talking about violence </v>

3290
02:30:41.051 --> 02:30:41.884
<v Speaker 2>being the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see certain certain political </v>

3291
02:30:44.051 --> 02:30:46.170
<v Speaker 2>movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I punch a Nazi.</v>

3292
02:30:46.500 --> 02:30:51.060
<v Speaker 4>I saw a term on reddit that I liked a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot called liberal baptist.</v>

3293
02:30:51.061 --> 02:30:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard of this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So basically the idea is like a,</v>

3294
02:30:55.170 --> 02:30:56.003
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in fundamentalism of any sort </v>

3295
02:30:58.410 --> 02:31:02.760
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the idea is when you're saying that</v>

3296
02:31:02.761 --> 02:31:03.900
<v Speaker 4>you're religious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's you're,</v>

3297
02:31:03.901 --> 02:31:08.901
<v Speaker 4>you're not really interested in another </v>
<v Speaker 4>person's soul or saving another person.</v>

3298
02:31:09.600 --> 02:31:10.433
<v Speaker 4>What you're interested in doing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>creating an ethical hierarchy that you </v>

3299
02:31:12.961 --> 02:31:15.900
<v Speaker 4>can dominate by being at the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ethical hierarchy.</v>

3300
02:31:15.901 --> 02:31:16.734
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what you're running into with this </v>

3301
02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:20.153
<v Speaker 4>that you're talking about is people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't really seem so concerned with how </v>

3302
02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:25.944
<v Speaker 4>society is supposed to be as much as </v>
<v Speaker 4>using their refined system that they've </v>

3303
02:31:32.041 --> 02:31:33.930
<v Speaker 4>come up with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

3304
02:31:33.960 --> 02:31:35.880
<v Speaker 4>they call it being woke or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3305
02:31:35.881 --> 02:31:36.750
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this rough,</v>

3306
02:31:36.751 --> 02:31:38.520
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to even keep up with it,</v>

3307
02:31:38.940 --> 02:31:39.773
<v Speaker 4>but they use it to try to dominate the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people around them by making you scared </v>

3308
02:31:43.801 --> 02:31:44.760
<v Speaker 4>to speak your mind.</v>

3309
02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:46.810
<v Speaker 4>Because the idea is it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3310
02:31:46.940 --> 02:31:47.773
<v Speaker 4>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of Mike the guests on my podcast </v>

3311
02:31:49.741 --> 02:31:50.574
<v Speaker 4>that I get fucking yelled at more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else for having on Jordan </v>

3312
02:31:54.720 --> 02:31:55.553
<v Speaker 4>Peterson that really pissed a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people after I had him on my podcast </v>

3313
02:31:59.550 --> 02:32:00.383
<v Speaker 4>because they feel they misunderstand him</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they think that Jordan Peterson </v>

3314
02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:08.460
<v Speaker 4>hates a transgendered people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

3315
02:32:08.461 --> 02:32:11.610
<v Speaker 4>Or they think that he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3316
02:32:11.611 --> 02:32:13.110
<v Speaker 4>I think that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think that he's like,</v>

3317
02:32:13.111 --> 02:32:13.944
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they think that he's like some kind of </v>

3318
02:32:15.031 --> 02:32:19.350
<v Speaker 4>outright spokesman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the truth of the matter is I don't,</v>

3319
02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:20.333
<v Speaker 4>I don't fully know all of Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the spectrum of Jordan Peterson's views </v>

3320
02:32:24.691 --> 02:32:27.240
<v Speaker 4>on things because it would take me a </v>
<v Speaker 4>very long time to do that.</v>

3321
02:32:27.241 --> 02:32:28.074
<v Speaker 4>I know he's fucking smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it was really cool for him to </v>

3322
02:32:30.331 --> 02:32:31.164
<v Speaker 4>call my podcasts and I know we had a </v>
<v Speaker 4>really great conversation that didn't </v>

3323
02:32:34.261 --> 02:32:35.094
<v Speaker 4>really talk about that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it didn't fit the narrative that </v>

3324
02:32:36.871 --> 02:32:37.704
<v Speaker 4>they want.</v>

3325
02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:38.793
<v Speaker 4>The narrative that they want is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a hateful person and then he hates </v>

3326
02:32:41.401 --> 02:32:42.234
<v Speaker 4>transgender people and that he's a bigot</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then he's just right wing outrights </v>

3327
02:32:45.720 --> 02:32:47.580
<v Speaker 4>poster boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not real.</v>

3328
02:32:47.670 --> 02:32:48.503
<v Speaker 4>The problem is people aren't willing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>adjust that once they stand on that </v>

3329
02:32:50.401 --> 02:32:51.234
<v Speaker 4>stance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they have that position that this </v>

3330
02:32:53.191 --> 02:32:54.024
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm left disguise right way and he's a </v>

3331
02:32:55.021 --> 02:32:56.940
<v Speaker 4>pig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's ruining things like that.</v>

3332
02:32:56.970 --> 02:32:58.280
<v Speaker 4>They just make up their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But can it,</v>

3333
02:32:58.281 --> 02:33:00.330
<v Speaker 4>can we throw it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me add one thing to this.</v>

3334
02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:01.583
<v Speaker 4>Imagine this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine Jordan Peterson and I don't </v>

3335
02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:05.700
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

3336
02:33:05.730 --> 02:33:10.730
<v Speaker 4>but just imagine there is a piece of him</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't for whatever reason,</v>

3337
02:33:11.310 --> 02:33:12.850
<v Speaker 4>like it he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3338
02:33:12.851 --> 02:33:13.381
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

3339
02:33:13.381 --> 02:33:16.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying this as an I have no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not implying it either.</v>

3340
02:33:16.590 --> 02:33:18.900
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying imagine fucking short </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jordan Peterson.</v>

3341
02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.943
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to think of some offensive </v>

3342
02:33:23.100 --> 02:33:23.933
<v Speaker 4>thing that he just imagined he had some </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece of him that was definitely </v>

3343
02:33:29.010 --> 02:33:31.020
<v Speaker 4>politically not correct.</v>

3344
02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:31.930
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

3345
02:33:32.250 --> 02:33:33.083
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't mean that all the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>shitty saying is invalidated by some </v>

3346
02:33:37.861 --> 02:33:41.100
<v Speaker 4>piece of him cause people are made up of</v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of different pieces.</v>

3347
02:33:41.130 --> 02:33:45.270
<v Speaker 4>Well that's basically in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not categorizing Jordan Peterson the</v>

3348
02:33:45.271 --> 02:33:48.600
<v Speaker 4>way you categorize descartes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's what he was saying.</v>

3349
02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:50.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That with great people,</v>

3350
02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:53.400
<v Speaker 4>they all also have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was the word?</v>

3351
02:33:53.401 --> 02:33:58.080
<v Speaker 4>He used a not great sin but great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the word?</v>

3352
02:33:58.081 --> 02:34:00.570
<v Speaker 4>He used to remember the word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the expression.</v>

3353
02:34:00.571 --> 02:34:03.030
<v Speaker 4>He ain't got shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got shit gun shit.</v>

3354
02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:05.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the great flaws as well as,</v>

3355
02:34:05.170 --> 02:34:06.080
<v Speaker 4>and I this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3356
02:34:06.100 --> 02:34:07.740
<v Speaker 4>this devices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what he said.</v>

3357
02:34:07.770 --> 02:34:10.830
<v Speaker 4>This is to me where the big fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>problem is,</v>

3358
02:34:10.831 --> 02:34:15.360
<v Speaker 4>is that people have lost the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be nuanced and people if and,</v>

3359
02:34:15.370 --> 02:34:18.730
<v Speaker 4>and that to me is where things are </v>
<v Speaker 4>really fucked up right now,</v>

3360
02:34:18.731 --> 02:34:22.060
<v Speaker 4>which is like you were throwing the baby</v>
<v Speaker 4>out with the bath water.</v>

3361
02:34:22.330 --> 02:34:23.740
<v Speaker 4>And I'm not saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3362
02:34:23.741 --> 02:34:26.740
<v Speaker 4>let's give a platform to people who have</v>
<v Speaker 4>like hate speech hate.</v>

3363
02:34:26.741 --> 02:34:27.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3364
02:34:27.320 --> 02:34:28.153
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that we have gotten to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>point now where just like free balling </v>

3365
02:34:33.101 --> 02:34:33.934
<v Speaker 4>and throwing around ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like we've done all over the place </v>

3366
02:34:36.581 --> 02:34:38.200
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you when I look at twitter,</v>

3367
02:34:38.470 --> 02:34:39.303
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be at least like five </v>
<v Speaker 4>people being like you fucking piece of </v>

3368
02:34:43.571 --> 02:34:44.404
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only because like I'm throwing around </v>

3369
02:34:45.791 --> 02:34:49.480
<v Speaker 4>ideas because my hope is through that </v>
<v Speaker 4>process,</v>

3370
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:50.703
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to get closer to the truth and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be able to look at myself </v>

3371
02:34:53.201 --> 02:34:56.200
<v Speaker 4>like what you said about the cock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the coke boy.</v>

3372
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:59.530
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked it because you're right.</v>

3373
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:02.260
<v Speaker 4>And I like what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even though his comedic is funny.</v>

3374
02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:03.550
<v Speaker 4>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3375
02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:05.920
<v Speaker 4>Why am I giving that guy a hard fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>tax you're going to do?</v>

3376
02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:08.110
<v Speaker 4>He can't not be born a cookson.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3377
02:35:08.140 --> 02:35:10.170
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like you can't change his birth and</v>

3378
02:35:10.171 --> 02:35:13.340
<v Speaker 4>his who he is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he taking over countries in Africa.</v>

3379
02:35:13.341 --> 02:35:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I know he's making cute shirts and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>banging a hot woman yet.</v>

3380
02:35:16.250 --> 02:35:17.980
<v Speaker 4>Hello.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd so that's to that.</v>

3381
02:35:17.981 --> 02:35:18.814
<v Speaker 4>But I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that having these kinds of </v>

3382
02:35:20.231 --> 02:35:23.770
<v Speaker 4>interactions with friends because it </v>
<v Speaker 4>helps me adjust even though I don't have</v>

3383
02:35:23.771 --> 02:35:27.010
<v Speaker 4>any real animosity for the koch brother </v>
<v Speaker 4>from that kind of thing.</v>

3384
02:35:27.011 --> 02:35:28.870
<v Speaker 4>I can look at my own fucking pattern and</v>
<v Speaker 4>be like,</v>

3385
02:35:28.871 --> 02:35:29.740
<v Speaker 4>whoa shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3386
02:35:29.741 --> 02:35:30.574
<v Speaker 4>that's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something to think about cause I </v>

3387
02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:33.580
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could be more compassionate there.</v>

3388
02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:36.040
<v Speaker 4>So my point is what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3389
02:35:36.041 --> 02:35:36.874
<v Speaker 4>what ends up happening and what leads to</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone who started off being </v>

3390
02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:40.673
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a,</v>

3391
02:35:41.350 --> 02:35:43.150
<v Speaker 4>who considers themselves part of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

3392
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:45.550
<v Speaker 4>There was true that's trying to stop </v>
<v Speaker 4>war.</v>

3393
02:35:45.850 --> 02:35:46.683
<v Speaker 4>That spawned the hippie movement and now</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like thankful that a train </v>

3394
02:35:50.471 --> 02:35:51.304
<v Speaker 4>accident happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a result of gradually shutting </v>

3395
02:35:55.181 --> 02:36:00.181
<v Speaker 4>down their ability to understand that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>human is much more than just one fucking</v>

3396
02:36:00.611 --> 02:36:01.444
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeff sessions is not just an anti </v>

3397
02:36:03.941 --> 02:36:07.430
<v Speaker 4>marijuana person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeff sessions is probably an elephant,</v>

3398
02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:08.553
<v Speaker 4>an elephant as sweet at that and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>person who's got a lot of love in him </v>

3399
02:36:12.130 --> 02:36:14.410
<v Speaker 4>and he's done a lot of good things for a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people,</v>

3400
02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:15.453
<v Speaker 4>but also he's got the worst fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>concept of what marijuana is and that </v>

3401
02:36:19.811 --> 02:36:20.644
<v Speaker 4>sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that doesn't invalidate any of the </v>

3402
02:36:22.361 --> 02:36:23.194
<v Speaker 4>love he's expressed throughout his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is unbearable for some people </v>

3403
02:36:26.771 --> 02:36:29.170
<v Speaker 4>to deal with because we want a darth </v>
<v Speaker 4>vader.</v>

3404
02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:30.063
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because we are inclined to </v>

3405
02:36:32.231 --> 02:36:35.920
<v Speaker 4>gravitate towards tribalism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a part of being human being.</v>

3406
02:36:35.921 --> 02:36:37.120
<v Speaker 4>It's always going to be a part.</v>

3407
02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:40.870
<v Speaker 4>It's the same reason why those </v>
<v Speaker 4>egyptologists were rejecting these ideas</v>

3408
02:36:40.871 --> 02:36:41.704
<v Speaker 4>from John Anthony West.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Robert Schoch cause they weren't a part </v>

3409
02:36:43.031 --> 02:36:43.864
<v Speaker 4>of the tribe and these new people coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>in with some shit that they didn't </v>

3410
02:36:46.571 --> 02:36:49.420
<v Speaker 4>figure it out on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a thing that people do on,</v>

3411
02:36:49.540 --> 02:36:50.373
<v Speaker 4>whether it's male versus female.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're seeing a lot of this when it </v>

3412
02:36:52.661 --> 02:36:53.494
<v Speaker 4>comes to this me too stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the weirdest things that happens </v>

3413
02:36:55.720 --> 02:36:56.553
<v Speaker 4>is that you start to getting this divide</v>
<v Speaker 4>where the men are men and the women and </v>

3414
02:36:59.021 --> 02:36:59.854
<v Speaker 4>the women in the matter of the men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even people that are non offenders and </v>

3415
02:37:01.561 --> 02:37:05.500
<v Speaker 4>and non victims.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They shore up on teams and yes,</v>

3416
02:37:05.501 --> 02:37:09.040
<v Speaker 4>it's good that people are being exposed </v>
<v Speaker 4>for doing bad things to people,</v>

3417
02:37:09.041 --> 02:37:09.874
<v Speaker 4>but it's also very dangerous for us to </v>
<v Speaker 4>just be men and women be on opposite </v>

3418
02:37:13.421 --> 02:37:14.530
<v Speaker 4>teams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're humans,</v>

3419
02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:16.320
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're supposed to be nice to each other.</v>

3420
02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:17.153
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes back to what we were talking </v>

3421
02:37:17.601 --> 02:37:18.760
<v Speaker 4>about earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

3422
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:22.040
<v Speaker 4>we don't say that enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really don't think we say it enough.</v>

3423
02:37:22.041 --> 02:37:24.320
<v Speaker 4>I really think we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it needs,</v>

3424
02:37:24.321 --> 02:37:25.970
<v Speaker 4>it should be reinforced and it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3425
02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.440
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking growth thing.</v>

3426
02:37:27.470 --> 02:37:28.460
<v Speaker 4>That's your advice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

3427
02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:30.380
<v Speaker 4>Be Nice to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3428
02:37:30.470 --> 02:37:31.400
<v Speaker 4>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My advice.</v>

3429
02:37:31.401 --> 02:37:32.234
<v Speaker 4>It's not my only advice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should also get your shit </v>

3430
02:37:34.281 --> 02:37:35.114
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should have some fucking </v>

3431
02:37:35.631 --> 02:37:37.310
<v Speaker 4>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you should eat right.</v>

3432
02:37:37.311 --> 02:37:39.070
<v Speaker 4>I think she'd do a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should read books,</v>

3433
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:41.270
<v Speaker 4>they should pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's tried to educate yourself.</v>

3434
02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:44.240
<v Speaker 4>I think he's tried to be aware about </v>
<v Speaker 4>objectivity and tribalism.</v>

3435
02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:47.780
<v Speaker 4>Where are the influence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I also think it would be really nice</v>

3436
02:37:47.810 --> 02:37:48.643
<v Speaker 4>if we all just agreed to be nicer to </v>
<v Speaker 4>each other and just have it as a </v>

3437
02:37:51.531 --> 02:37:55.280
<v Speaker 4>conversation that the country has and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then ultimately the world has.</v>

3438
02:37:55.310 --> 02:37:57.530
<v Speaker 4>But that list of things you just gave </v>
<v Speaker 4>before that.</v>

3439
02:37:57.590 --> 02:37:58.423
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that all fits into the category </v>

3440
02:37:59.901 --> 02:38:02.780
<v Speaker 4>of being kind to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that the way you're going to</v>

3441
02:38:02.781 --> 02:38:03.614
<v Speaker 4>learn to be nice to other people is by </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning how to be kinder to yourself </v>

3442
02:38:06.861 --> 02:38:10.550
<v Speaker 4>and being kind to yourself means </v>
<v Speaker 4>treating your body better.</v>

3443
02:38:10.551 --> 02:38:11.384
<v Speaker 4>And that's loving yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like this is actually one of the </v>

3444
02:38:15.711 --> 02:38:18.740
<v Speaker 4>things this Guy Jack Kornfield taught </v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

3445
02:38:18.741 --> 02:38:20.450
<v Speaker 4>which I like a lot cause I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>to him about,</v>

3446
02:38:20.451 --> 02:38:21.284
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know I want to fucking get in shape </v>

3447
02:38:22.161 --> 02:38:24.290
<v Speaker 4>and like I feel bad cause I want to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>more in shape.</v>

3448
02:38:24.800 --> 02:38:25.760
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3449
02:38:26.060 --> 02:38:29.990
<v Speaker 4>but the way you're talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're hating yourself right now.</v>

3450
02:38:30.010 --> 02:38:30.843
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get in shape because you hate who </v>

3451
02:38:32.631 --> 02:38:33.464
<v Speaker 4>you are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get in shape because you love yourself </v>

3452
02:38:35.451 --> 02:38:37.770
<v Speaker 4>enough to want to feel better and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3453
02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:40.910
<v Speaker 4>So saying that it changes the way I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at it.</v>

3454
02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:42.200
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3455
02:38:42.201 --> 02:38:43.880
<v Speaker 4>Like you just saying that I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3456
02:38:43.910 --> 02:38:44.840
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3457
02:38:45.020 --> 02:38:49.220
<v Speaker 4>don't hate your body loving by getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>it healthy and then by loving you,</v>

3458
02:38:49.250 --> 02:38:51.830
<v Speaker 4>that's loving your site changes the </v>
<v Speaker 4>intention around from like,</v>

3459
02:38:51.831 --> 02:38:55.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to destroy my fall myself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>replace it with a better self.</v>

3460
02:38:55.821 --> 02:38:59.510
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm going to love this being I</v>
<v Speaker 4>am right now and the way I'm going to do</v>

3461
02:38:59.511 --> 02:39:00.950
<v Speaker 4>that is by,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

3462
02:39:00.980 --> 02:39:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to have five beers a night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

3463
02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:04.853
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to pour the booze into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing every night as much as I have </v>

3464
02:39:07.731 --> 02:39:08.564
<v Speaker 4>been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need to smoke cigarettes or I </v>

3465
02:39:09.321 --> 02:39:12.740
<v Speaker 4>don't eat whatever the thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that attitude of like,</v>

3466
02:39:12.741 --> 02:39:16.250
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing this because I am not </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing this because I hate myself.</v>

3467
02:39:16.250 --> 02:39:18.060
<v Speaker 4>It's just this is a different ways of me</v>
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>

3468
02:39:18.410 --> 02:39:20.720
<v Speaker 4>for me to express love into my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

3469
02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:23.180
<v Speaker 4>And then from that it radiates out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you did.</v>

3470
02:39:23.480 --> 02:39:27.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what you do is like part </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what appeals I think.</v>

3471
02:39:27.051 --> 02:39:27.884
<v Speaker 4>And and you that appeals to people is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're sort of radiating this like </v>

3472
02:39:33.830 --> 02:39:37.580
<v Speaker 4>way of being that offers a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sense of like,</v>

3473
02:39:37.610 --> 02:39:39.140
<v Speaker 4>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could probably do that.</v>

3474
02:39:39.350 --> 02:39:42.230
<v Speaker 4>I could probably do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it draws people in.</v>

3475
02:39:42.440 --> 02:39:45.050
<v Speaker 4>So this kindness that you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

3476
02:39:45.410 --> 02:39:47.000
<v Speaker 4>it's contagious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3477
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.863
<v Speaker 4>it is contagious and it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's our cultures operate on the </v>

3478
02:39:52.821 --> 02:39:55.820
<v Speaker 4>momentum of the people that are in them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3479
02:39:55.850 --> 02:39:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Nazi Germany is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was Denmark,</v>

3480
02:39:58.760 --> 02:39:59.593
<v Speaker 4>so it was Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was really interesting </v>

3481
02:40:00.651 --> 02:40:02.600
<v Speaker 4>cultures that are very different from </v>
<v Speaker 4>other cultures.</v>

3482
02:40:02.601 --> 02:40:03.434
<v Speaker 4>China's very different from a Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we vary widely in the way we </v>

3483
02:40:07.791 --> 02:40:11.750
<v Speaker 4>behave and I think there's a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>different styles of being a person.</v>

3484
02:40:11.960 --> 02:40:14.130
<v Speaker 4>And I think the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is a problem</v>

3485
02:40:14.130 --> 02:40:19.130
<v Speaker 8>that I had as a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had an ultra competitive issue.</v>

3486
02:40:19.710 --> 02:40:22.800
<v Speaker 8>I was competitive with my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was competitive with other men.</v>

3487
02:40:23.010 --> 02:40:23.843
<v Speaker 8>I was competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would shit on people that I didn't </v>

3488
02:40:25.441 --> 02:40:26.940
<v Speaker 8>know.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look at this fucking loser,</v>

3489
02:40:27.090 --> 02:40:29.940
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like it's a natural thing that young men</v>

3490
02:40:29.941 --> 02:40:30.774
<v Speaker 8>go through.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it took me until I was probably in </v>

3491
02:40:33.331 --> 02:40:35.940
<v Speaker 8>my early twenties till I realized how </v>
<v Speaker 8>toxic that was.</v>

3492
02:40:36.210 --> 02:40:40.920
<v Speaker 8>And I moved myself out of it and instead</v>
<v Speaker 8>started celebrating people around me.</v>

3493
02:40:40.980 --> 02:40:45.960
<v Speaker 8>I changed my vibe because I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was very flawed as a young men,</v>

3494
02:40:45.961 --> 02:40:50.940
<v Speaker 8>but also super hyper self critical.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So my hyper self critical,</v>

3495
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:53.310
<v Speaker 8>I always wanted to be a better version </v>
<v Speaker 8>of myself,</v>

3496
02:40:53.730 --> 02:40:54.450
<v Speaker 8>but,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and I would,</v>

3497
02:40:54.450 --> 02:40:57.780
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't do it the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like it was Jack Cornfield's idea.</v>

3498
02:40:57.930 --> 02:40:58.630
<v Speaker 8>Who's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>who is it?</v>

3499
02:40:58.630 --> 02:41:01.650
<v Speaker 8>Cornfield Jack Cornfield's idea.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I didn't do it the right way.</v>

3500
02:41:01.650 --> 02:41:02.483
<v Speaker 8>I didn't do it his way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I did it the way that a barely educated </v>

3501
02:41:06.630 --> 02:41:07.463
<v Speaker 8>21 year old man who's mostly just read </v>
<v Speaker 8>books on a combat sports and fighting </v>

3502
02:41:13.201 --> 02:41:14.034
<v Speaker 8>philosophy in psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have a very limited amount of </v>

3503
02:41:16.141 --> 02:41:18.960
<v Speaker 8>information in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I realized that there was some flaws</v>

3504
02:41:18.961 --> 02:41:19.794
<v Speaker 8>in the way I was thinking and I realized</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was spending all this energy getting </v>

3505
02:41:22.921 --> 02:41:23.754
<v Speaker 8>mad at people that I didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hating people that had things that I </v>

3506
02:41:26.221 --> 02:41:29.370
<v Speaker 8>didn't have and I really,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was sitting around thinking about this</v>

3507
02:41:29.371 --> 02:41:33.570
<v Speaker 8>once and it was as I was becoming more </v>
<v Speaker 8>successful as a martial artist,</v>

3508
02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:34.703
<v Speaker 8>I was realizing that one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 8>that was holding me back before was my </v>

3509
02:41:36.661 --> 02:41:38.870
<v Speaker 8>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And it wasn't just my physical talent,</v>

3510
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:40.350
<v Speaker 8>my skills,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which also got better,</v>

3511
02:41:40.500 --> 02:41:41.333
<v Speaker 8>but it was also that I had a better way </v>
<v Speaker 8>of approaching competition that I had </v>

3512
02:41:44.101 --> 02:41:46.440
<v Speaker 8>when I was younger because it didn't </v>
<v Speaker 8>carry as much anxiety.</v>

3513
02:41:46.770 --> 02:41:48.360
<v Speaker 8>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was still anxious,</v>

3514
02:41:48.450 --> 02:41:49.283
<v Speaker 8>but less anxiety because I was more at </v>
<v Speaker 8>peace with being around all these </v>

3515
02:41:51.181 --> 02:41:53.880
<v Speaker 8>different people and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fuck this guy who's this fucking guy.</v>

3516
02:41:53.940 --> 02:41:58.110
<v Speaker 8>I changed my strategy and it changed who</v>
<v Speaker 8>I am and then as I got into comedy,</v>

3517
02:41:58.111 --> 02:42:01.590
<v Speaker 8>I was alleviated by the actual real </v>
<v Speaker 8>threat of competition,</v>

3518
02:42:01.890 --> 02:42:02.723
<v Speaker 8>which greatly relaxed to me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was a giant weight lifted off my </v>

3519
02:42:05.581 --> 02:42:07.740
<v Speaker 8>back,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that carried a little bit of that.</v>

3520
02:42:07.741 --> 02:42:10.530
<v Speaker 8>In the early days of stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would look at other comedians like,</v>

3521
02:42:10.531 --> 02:42:11.364
<v Speaker 8>fuck this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I get jealous of guys that were doing </v>

3522
02:42:13.441 --> 02:42:16.770
<v Speaker 8>successful I that we're doing well </v>
<v Speaker 8>rather that we're successful.</v>

3523
02:42:16.771 --> 02:42:18.780
<v Speaker 8>I got jealous of guys who were funnier </v>
<v Speaker 8>than me,</v>

3524
02:42:18.781 --> 02:42:20.040
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why is he fucking funnier than me?</v>

3525
02:42:20.250 --> 02:42:21.083
<v Speaker 8>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was a stupid thought process and it </v>

3526
02:42:23.521 --> 02:42:24.660
<v Speaker 8>took me till I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3527
02:42:24.661 --> 02:42:28.260
<v Speaker 8>like 2123 I started realizing like I got</v>
<v Speaker 8>to snap out of this.</v>

3528
02:42:28.260 --> 02:42:29.093
<v Speaker 8>This is unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I'm wasting this energy where it </v>

3529
02:42:31.711 --> 02:42:33.330
<v Speaker 8>should be concentrating on positive </v>
<v Speaker 8>things.</v>

3530
02:42:33.450 --> 02:42:34.283
<v Speaker 8>So I just started supporting my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I started being like a more </v>

3531
02:42:36.661 --> 02:42:38.090
<v Speaker 8>complimentary person.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I started,</v>

3532
02:42:38.130 --> 02:42:40.980
<v Speaker 8>I just went out of my way to just be </v>
<v Speaker 8>nicer to people,</v>

3533
02:42:40.981 --> 02:42:41.814
<v Speaker 8>be nicer to people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>not because they could do something for </v>

3534
02:42:43.741 --> 02:42:44.730
<v Speaker 8>me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just to be nice,</v>

3535
02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:45.673
<v Speaker 8>like it feels good to be nice and I just</v>
<v Speaker 8>slowly cultivated a better philosophy </v>

3536
02:42:49.800 --> 02:42:51.210
<v Speaker 8>and it took me a while,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

3537
02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:53.790
<v Speaker 8>It took me until I was in my twenties </v>
<v Speaker 8>till I really like,</v>

3538
02:42:53.970 --> 02:42:57.870
<v Speaker 8>as I was like getting closer to 30 is </v>
<v Speaker 8>when I started really getting good at it</v>

3539
02:42:57.871 --> 02:42:59.280
<v Speaker 8>with comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3540
02:42:59.281 --> 02:43:02.370
<v Speaker 8>like bringing comedians on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Helping people.</v>

3541
02:43:02.420 --> 02:43:05.930
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's fostering other career.</v>

3542
02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:08.850
<v Speaker 8>Telling kids that were like seven years </v>
<v Speaker 8>before,</v>

3543
02:43:08.851 --> 02:43:10.140
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>behind me like they were,</v>

3544
02:43:10.141 --> 02:43:11.890
<v Speaker 8>they started out seven years after me.</v>

3545
02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:13.930
<v Speaker 5>I'm at a seven years ahead of you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can do this.</v>

3546
02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:15.170
<v Speaker 5>Anybody can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3547

<v Speaker 5>Just do it.</v>

3548
02:43:16.301 --> 02:43:18.550
<v Speaker 5>And if you fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>learn from that fuck up.</v>

3549
02:43:18.551 --> 02:43:19.540
<v Speaker 5>Get better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is,</v>

3550

<v Speaker 5>this and you're gonna.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You already made it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3554
02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:26.740
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the,</v>

3555
02:43:26.890 --> 02:43:29.890
<v Speaker 5>so this thing that you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing that I,</v>

3556
02:43:29.891 --> 02:43:30.724
<v Speaker 5>that the Rom Dass people teach me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is invaluable and it to me and it </v>

3557
02:43:35.261 --> 02:43:36.094
<v Speaker 5>really inspires you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that they talk about Ron does his </v>

3558
02:43:38.741 --> 02:43:39.574
<v Speaker 5>guru,</v>
<v Speaker 5>neem Karoli Baba and how when he was </v>

3559
02:43:40.691 --> 02:43:42.580
<v Speaker 5>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he never said,</v>

3560
02:43:42.581 --> 02:43:45.220
<v Speaker 5>here's what this is going to do for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3561
02:43:45.221 --> 02:43:46.054
<v Speaker 5>He was never like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is why this is how it's going to </v>

3562
02:43:47.261 --> 02:43:49.180
<v Speaker 5>help you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was always saying,</v>

3563
02:43:49.181 --> 02:43:51.730
<v Speaker 5>here's how this is going to help the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people in your life.</v>

3564
02:43:52.180 --> 02:43:53.013
<v Speaker 5>And so the moment you make that little </v>
<v Speaker 5>shift where working on yourself as it's </v>

3565
02:43:57.641 --> 02:44:00.790
<v Speaker 5>called,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is not about doing something so that you</v>

3566
02:44:00.791 --> 02:44:03.880
<v Speaker 5>can fucking have a fucking six pack and </v>
<v Speaker 5>played.</v>

3567
02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:08.350
<v Speaker 5>But the moment you start doing our fun </v>
<v Speaker 5>in a cow and ride a horse,</v>

3568
02:44:08.351 --> 02:44:10.180
<v Speaker 5>shaving,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shaving your stomach,</v>

3569
02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:11.033
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the moment you start fucking doing </v>

3570
02:44:12.191 --> 02:44:17.191
<v Speaker 5>this stuff because you know that it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to directly help the people around</v>

3571
02:44:18.821 --> 02:44:19.654
<v Speaker 5>you in ways you can't even imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you don't even know yet because </v>

3572
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:27.700
<v Speaker 5>there's going to be a moment in every </v>
<v Speaker 5>single person's life where someone comes</v>

3573
02:44:27.701 --> 02:44:28.534
<v Speaker 5>up to you who is in a lot of trouble and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they need help and it might not be </v>

3574
02:44:33.041 --> 02:44:34.000
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it might not.</v>

3575
02:44:34.180 --> 02:44:36.190
<v Speaker 5>It might just be something you could say</v>
<v Speaker 5>to them.</v>

3576
02:44:36.220 --> 02:44:37.053
<v Speaker 5>It might just be something you need to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be lucid in that moment and because </v>

3577
02:44:40.481 --> 02:44:42.580
<v Speaker 5>you've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3578
02:44:42.610 --> 02:44:46.700
<v Speaker 5>not paying attention and you're blurry </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're angry and you're fucking shut</v>

3579
02:44:46.701 --> 02:44:49.270
<v Speaker 5>down that you're not even going to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>that person.</v>

3580
02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:50.193
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That person is going to just be another </v>

3581
02:44:51.911 --> 02:44:53.830
<v Speaker 5>face in the crowd that you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 5>see.</v>

3582
02:44:54.040 --> 02:44:57.670
<v Speaker 5>But that's the whole point is like this </v>
<v Speaker 5>practice your practice.</v>

3583
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:59.383
<v Speaker 5>It ends up helping so many fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>people and if you want to get excited </v>

3584
02:45:03.701 --> 02:45:05.500
<v Speaker 5>about something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at least for me,</v>

3585
02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:06.633
<v Speaker 5>what makes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really kind of difficult for me to </v>

3586
02:45:09.821 --> 02:45:12.430
<v Speaker 5>get super excited over like I don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

3587
02:45:12.790 --> 02:45:16.330
<v Speaker 5>some kind of like thing that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it give me an extra thing.</v>

3588
02:45:16.331 --> 02:45:18.250
<v Speaker 5>It's way less exciting than to think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that like,</v>

3589
02:45:18.251 --> 02:45:19.084
<v Speaker 5>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3590
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:22.720
<v Speaker 5>if I can be more calm and more </v>
<v Speaker 5>connected,</v>

3591
02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:27.400
<v Speaker 5>then the next time around somebody I </v>
<v Speaker 5>love and get angry,</v>

3592
02:45:28.030 --> 02:45:28.863
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to hurt them because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>learning how to not react to my own </v>

3593
02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:33.750
<v Speaker 5>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

3594
02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:35.590
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're getting better at live.</v>

3595
02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:36.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3596
02:45:36.520 --> 02:45:38.020
<v Speaker 2>And it's through trial and error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3597
02:45:38.021 --> 02:45:40.330
<v Speaker 2>that is a trial error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honesty.</v>

3598
02:45:41.210 --> 02:45:42.043
<v Speaker 2>And you also have to realize that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not all coming from the same starting </v>

3599
02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:45.190
<v Speaker 2>block.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3600
02:45:45.280 --> 02:45:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people came from uh,</v>

3601
02:45:46.931 --> 02:45:47.764
<v Speaker 2>abusive childhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people came from super supportive </v>

3602
02:45:50.201 --> 02:45:52.720
<v Speaker 2>and loving childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people were spoiled as children and</v>

3603
02:45:52.721 --> 02:45:53.554
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the people that struggle the </v>

3604
02:45:54.251 --> 02:45:55.084
<v Speaker 2>most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you see in kids that grow up </v>

3605
02:45:57.161 --> 02:46:01.030
<v Speaker 2>in like really rich families where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pee pee parents weren't hands on.</v>

3606
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:02.960
<v Speaker 2>They're so disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3607
02:46:02.961 --> 02:46:03.794
<v Speaker 2>You feel really weird and titled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a very distorted version of </v>

3608
02:46:06.611 --> 02:46:08.140
<v Speaker 2>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those people,</v>

3609
02:46:08.141 --> 02:46:10.580
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to adjust from a place of</v>

3610
02:46:10.581 --> 02:46:11.420
<v Speaker 2>bounty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3611
02:46:11.540 --> 02:46:14.750
<v Speaker 2>To a place of struggle and success and </v>
<v Speaker 2>in in,</v>

3612
02:46:14.780 --> 02:46:15.613
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self realization almost more difficult </v>

3613
02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:18.673
<v Speaker 2>for some of those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Compassion look neat growing up as a </v>

3614
02:46:21.021 --> 02:46:22.550
<v Speaker 2>person who didn't have money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3615
02:46:22.551 --> 02:46:24.200
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thinking as when I was a child,</v>

3616
02:46:24.201 --> 02:46:28.370
<v Speaker 2>when my family was on welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking I still can remember at least I</v>

3617
02:46:28.371 --> 02:46:29.204
<v Speaker 2>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an idea of a memory of us drinking </v>

3618
02:46:31.401 --> 02:46:32.234
<v Speaker 2>powdered milk.</v>

3619
02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:33.193
<v Speaker 2>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember being really embarrassed if </v>

3620
02:46:36.541 --> 02:46:38.810
<v Speaker 2>people would come over our house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had powdered milk,</v>

3621
02:46:38.811 --> 02:46:39.900
<v Speaker 2>we are poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3622
02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:44.920
<v Speaker 2>and that memory of being a young man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being a struggling young comedian,</v>

3623
02:46:46.461 --> 02:46:49.340
<v Speaker 2>doing a bunch of odd jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make it like this,</v>

3624
02:46:49.370 --> 02:46:50.203
<v Speaker 2>this real hunger and worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one of the most embarrassing </v>

3625
02:46:52.821 --> 02:46:55.430
<v Speaker 2>moments of my young life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3626
02:46:55.431 --> 02:46:56.264
<v Speaker 2>I had this thing fall out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like some management company was </v>

3627
02:46:59.991 --> 02:47:00.824
<v Speaker 2>interested in me and they were like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>music management company and they were </v>

3628
02:47:04.101 --> 02:47:04.934
<v Speaker 2>thinking about branching off into </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians and guy was talking to me </v>

3629
02:47:06.591 --> 02:47:10.700
<v Speaker 2>about it and it was falling apart and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was driving with my girlfriend and I was</v>

3630
02:47:10.701 --> 02:47:11.534
<v Speaker 2>21 and the whole thing was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrating to me that I just started </v>

3631
02:47:13.581 --> 02:47:15.080
<v Speaker 2>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tears rolling.</v>

3632
02:47:15.081 --> 02:47:16.340
<v Speaker 2>And I remember she looked over and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3633
02:47:16.341 --> 02:47:17.174
<v Speaker 2>are you crying?</v>

3634
02:47:17.510 --> 02:47:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3635
02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:20.090
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

3636
02:47:20.120 --> 02:47:20.953
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she was like mocking the fact that </v>

3637
02:47:24.471 --> 02:47:26.750
<v Speaker 2>I was crying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She couldn't help herself,</v>

3638
02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:28.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was same age,</v>

3639
02:47:28.281 --> 02:47:30.470
<v Speaker 2>we're both at 21 we were both kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3640
02:47:30.471 --> 02:47:31.850
<v Speaker 2>and she just thought it was a bitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

3641
02:47:32.150 --> 02:47:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Just be crying about being frustrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>about your career.</v>

3642
02:47:34.911 --> 02:47:36.110
<v Speaker 2>And I remember being so embarrassed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

3643
02:47:36.111 --> 02:47:39.620
<v Speaker 2>why did I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I let that out to her?</v>

3644
02:47:39.621 --> 02:47:42.170
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did I let that out in public at this</v>

3645
02:47:42.171 --> 02:47:45.620
<v Speaker 2>frustration of not knowing where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future lies,</v>

3646
02:47:45.980 --> 02:47:46.813
<v Speaker 2>but that frustration and that hunger of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like wanting to figure out a way to get </v>

3647
02:47:51.261 --> 02:47:52.094
<v Speaker 2>out of this cycle of work in shitty jobs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and figure out how to do something that </v>

3648
02:47:54.711 --> 02:47:57.050
<v Speaker 2>I actually love doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like be a comic that,</v>

3649
02:47:57.290 --> 02:47:59.480
<v Speaker 2>that burning hunger cause you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3650
02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:00.920
<v Speaker 2>That's where it all comes from.</v>

3651
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:02.780
<v Speaker 2>Would you don't know where the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay your rent.</v>

3652

<v Speaker 2>You do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do not have an escape route.</v>

3653
02:48:05.270 --> 02:48:08.210

<v Speaker 2>You got to figure this fucking thing out</v>

<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3655
02:48:09.861 --> 02:48:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Right now it's fallen apart and nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody thinks you're any good.</v>

3656
02:48:12.531 --> 02:48:13.364
<v Speaker 2>You can't get booked like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to figure out what's the </v>

<v Speaker 2>next job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get it so you could feed</v>

3658
02:48:16.731 --> 02:48:17.564
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We tried to figure out this weird thing </v>

3659
02:48:18.711 --> 02:48:20.330
<v Speaker 2>that nobody could really tell you how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

3660
02:48:20.940 --> 02:48:23.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then going through that struggle,</v>

3661
02:48:23.240 --> 02:48:24.073
<v Speaker 2>that is everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people need to hear that you went </v>

3662
02:48:27.231 --> 02:48:28.720
<v Speaker 2>through it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to hear that,</v>

3663
02:48:28.721 --> 02:48:29.554
<v Speaker 2>that during the dark days where it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't seem like it's ever going to </v>

3664
02:48:30.891 --> 02:48:32.750
<v Speaker 2>work out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you alive?</v>

3665
02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Can you see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you talk?</v>

3666
02:48:34.671 --> 02:48:36.980
<v Speaker 2>Can you think get better,</v>

3669
02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:42.590
<v Speaker 2>Now everybody sucks at everything when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they first start.</v>

3670
02:48:43.010 --> 02:48:45.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole thing about getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at something,</v>

3671
02:48:45.261 --> 02:48:46.880
<v Speaker 2>but if you love it and you're really </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>

3672
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:48.980
<v Speaker 2>don't lie to yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't lie to yourself.</v>

3673
02:48:48.981 --> 02:48:49.814
<v Speaker 2>Look at it for what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at it for what it is and work on </v>

3674
02:48:51.201 --> 02:48:52.370
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever the fuck it is,</v>

3675
02:48:52.490 --> 02:48:57.490
<v Speaker 2>whether it's writing books or make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick or composing a computer code,</v>

<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>

3677
02:49:02.210 --> 02:49:04.850

<v Speaker 2>But look at it for what it is.</v>

3678
02:49:04.910 --> 02:49:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Look at it for really what it is and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of our biggest problems.</v>

3679
02:49:07.770 --> 02:49:08.603
<v Speaker 2>One of our biggest problems is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have a really hard time looking </v>

3680
02:49:10.921 --> 02:49:12.530
<v Speaker 2>at things for what they are if they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not flattering.</v>

3681
02:49:12.540 --> 02:49:13.740
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3682
02:49:13.741 --> 02:49:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck this guy.</v>

3683
02:49:15.330 --> 02:49:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Fuck this guy goes a pussy now that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shot a fucking rocket into space with</v>

3684
02:49:20.401 --> 02:49:21.234
<v Speaker 2>a car on it.</v>

3685
02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:23.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did it with his mind.</v>

3686
02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:25.860
<v Speaker 2>He figured out how to make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>calculations.</v>

3687
02:49:25.861 --> 02:49:28.980
<v Speaker 2>You figured out how to make enough money</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he could shoot a car in a space.</v>

3688
02:49:29.100 --> 02:49:32.610
<v Speaker 2>If you don't respect that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's digging tunnels under La.</v>

3689
02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:33.473
<v Speaker 2>They'll let them dig tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an earthquake ridden area and </v>

3690
02:49:36.331 --> 02:49:38.730
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker is digging holes in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground.</v>

3691
02:49:38.880 --> 02:49:41.760
<v Speaker 2>We're worried about fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're like Eli musk got it.</v>

3692
02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:43.440
<v Speaker 2>He said it's not going to cause an </v>
<v Speaker 2>earthquake.</v>

3693
02:49:43.441 --> 02:49:44.940
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to cause an earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3694
02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:46.073
<v Speaker 2>we're worried about people fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not worried about Elon musk </v>

3695
02:49:47.820 --> 02:49:49.980
<v Speaker 2>turning our fucking city into Swiss </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>

3697
02:49:51.451 --> 02:49:52.284
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing is is that the guy you're </v>

3698
02:49:53.910 --> 02:49:56.700
<v Speaker 5>make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're like creating an image of the guy</v>

<v Speaker 5>felt like shit.</v>

02:50:07.050 --> 02:50:07.883

<v Speaker 5>That's all coming from feeling like </v>

3704
02:50:10.951 --> 02:50:11.784
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And when you get around somebody who's </v>

3705
02:50:14.371 --> 02:50:18.750
<v Speaker 5>acting like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you've looked into yourself enough to</v>

3706
02:50:18.751 --> 02:50:19.584
<v Speaker 5>see where you feel like shit and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get around somebody and you realize </v>

3707
02:50:22.621 --> 02:50:23.454
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh this person is like being a complete </v>

<v Speaker 5>and who you're partnering with Ron Doss.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Dalai Lama.</v>

3711
02:50:37.411 --> 02:50:39.060
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is like not parting with it.</v>

3712
02:50:39.120 --> 02:50:41.250
<v Speaker 5>I would love to party with a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dalai Lama.</v>

3713
02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:42.113
<v Speaker 5>I would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm really might nullify my cock if I </v>

3714
02:50:44.431 --> 02:50:47.370
<v Speaker 5>got a chance to party with the Dalai </v>
<v Speaker 5>Lama space forever.</v>

3715
02:50:47.371 --> 02:50:48.720
<v Speaker 5>It's another thing to talk to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd do.</v>

3716
02:50:48.930 --> 02:50:49.763
<v Speaker 5>I'd love to be around that guy man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just cause like when he was like so far </v>

3717
02:50:52.201 --> 02:50:54.360
<v Speaker 5>down in this massive place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this little guy,</v>

3718
02:50:55.140 --> 02:50:55.973
<v Speaker 5>you could feel his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the energy rushing off of this guy into </v>

3719
02:50:59.131 --> 02:51:01.910
<v Speaker 5>the room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It will be trippin maybe.</v>

3720
02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:03.930
<v Speaker 5>But anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But anyway,</v>

3721
02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:08.520
<v Speaker 5>the thing that he said that stuck with </v>
<v Speaker 5>me as he's like,</v>

3722
02:51:11.100 --> 02:51:14.100
<v Speaker 5>one of the things he says is so simple </v>
<v Speaker 5>and it reminds me what you're saying now</v>

3723
02:51:14.101 --> 02:51:18.450
<v Speaker 5>is he said you can always be kinder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the other thing he said,</v>

3724
02:51:18.480 --> 02:51:21.120
<v Speaker 5>and it sounds so simple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but really people don't realize that you</v>

3725
02:51:21.121 --> 02:51:21.954
<v Speaker 5>can always be kinder at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then the other thing he said is if </v>

3726
02:51:24.721 --> 02:51:29.340
<v Speaker 5>someone's being unkind to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not them being unkind to you.</v>

3727
02:51:29.340 --> 02:51:31.170
<v Speaker 5>It's an echo,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is what he said.</v>

3728
02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:32.033
<v Speaker 5>Like it's literally an echo of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>unkindness people being cruel to them </v>

3729
02:51:36.871 --> 02:51:41.610
<v Speaker 5>throughout their lives and that shit is </v>
<v Speaker 5>bouncing off of them like sound.</v>

3730
02:51:41.850 --> 02:51:45.640
<v Speaker 5>It's bouncing onto you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so when you get around someone who's</v>

3731
02:51:45.660 --> 02:51:46.493
<v Speaker 5>like being a shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're really experiencing is that </v>

3732
02:51:50.020 --> 02:51:54.690
<v Speaker 5>there you're a lot of sorrow from a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of places you don't know.</v>

3733
02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:55.673
<v Speaker 5>And that doesn't mean you're supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 5>lay back and let them like spit on you </v>

3734
02:51:58.981 --> 02:52:01.710
<v Speaker 5>or be a shithead to you or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it also,</v>

3735
02:52:01.711 --> 02:52:04.350
<v Speaker 5>it helps you find a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 5>compassion,</v>

3736
02:52:04.510 --> 02:52:06.580
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just just so you can be with that</v>

3737
02:52:06.581 --> 02:52:11.581
<v Speaker 5>person and let them be what they are </v>
<v Speaker 5>without adding more suffering to it.</v>

3738
02:52:13.340 --> 02:52:15.580
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which only compounds</v>

3739
02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:17.050
<v Speaker 8>this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3740
02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:20.840
<v Speaker 8>you have to learn how people are </v>
<v Speaker 8>responding to that behavior too and,</v>

3741
02:52:20.841 --> 02:52:21.674
<v Speaker 8>and adjust accordingly.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Get and do the hard work and look at </v>

3742
02:52:24.251 --> 02:52:25.084
<v Speaker 8>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And when people get super self </v>

3743
02:52:27.041 --> 02:52:27.874
<v Speaker 8>indulgent,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of the things that they do is they </v>

3744
02:52:28.451 --> 02:52:30.580
<v Speaker 8>don't think about how other people are </v>
<v Speaker 8>experiencing them.</v>

3745
02:52:30.650 --> 02:52:31.483
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like if you're around people like </v>

3746
02:52:32.021 --> 02:52:35.200
<v Speaker 8>fucking the fucking worse look always </v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking happens to me.</v>

3747
02:52:35.410 --> 02:52:40.200
<v Speaker 8>It's safety every day at work.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Fucking boss knows it wasn't.</v>

3748
02:52:40.210 --> 02:52:44.830
<v Speaker 8>Mike did put in the work.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I put fucking 65 70% of the work.</v>

3749
02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:46.880
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>

3750
02:52:48.320 --> 02:52:49.450
<v Speaker 8>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Does she leave?</v>

3751
02:52:51.780 --> 02:52:53.620
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Maybe this is the way you're behaving.</v>

3776
02:53:39.990 --> 02:53:40.823
<v Speaker 8>We mapped out your life or am I saying </v>
<v Speaker 8>that you shouldn't be there for your </v>

3777
02:53:43.361 --> 02:53:44.194
<v Speaker 8>friends when issues arise and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>certainly all of our friends are super </v>

3778
02:53:47.831 --> 02:53:48.664
<v Speaker 8>supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We've all gone through some weird shit </v>

3779

<v Speaker 8>in our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We've all been super supportive,</v>

<v Speaker 8>few hours and map out my future roadway </v>
<v Speaker 8>pressured cause it's just fucking hard </v>

<v Speaker 8>Fuck you dude.</v>

3791
02:54:21.160 --> 02:54:21.993
<v Speaker 8>It's what it is man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Come up these toxic excuses for why </v>

3792
02:54:24.851 --> 02:54:27.580
<v Speaker 8>their life is shit without ever looking </v>
<v Speaker 8>inward.</v>

3793
02:54:27.581 --> 02:54:28.414
<v Speaker 8>And they'd want you to admit your </v>
<v Speaker 8>privilege and admit your fucking </v>

3794
02:54:30.581 --> 02:54:31.414
<v Speaker 8>advantages bro.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hello you Duncan [inaudible] it was </v>

3795
02:54:34.661 --> 02:54:36.280
<v Speaker 8>easier for you.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The truth for me.</v>

3796
02:54:36.980 --> 02:54:37.813
<v Speaker 8>But,</v>

3797
02:54:39.250 --> 02:54:41.800
<v Speaker 5>but the question is like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I know exactly what you're talking</v>

3798
02:54:41.801 --> 02:54:42.634
<v Speaker 5>about and I know that person and I know </v>
<v Speaker 5>when I run into that with that is </v>

3799
02:54:49.661 --> 02:54:50.494
<v Speaker 5>there's a part of me that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I like what I know sometimes you </v>

3800
02:54:53.591 --> 02:54:57.310
<v Speaker 5>just have to put someone you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like avoid their presence.</v>

3801
02:54:57.370 --> 02:54:59.110
<v Speaker 5>So you gonna say put them on blast.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought you were going,</v>

3802
02:54:59.111 --> 02:55:00.850
<v Speaker 5>can I put them on blast?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3803
02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:02.440
<v Speaker 5>cause it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That doesn't work.</v>

3804
02:55:02.441 --> 02:55:04.040
<v Speaker 5>But maybe it does for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>

3805
02:55:04.041 --> 02:55:05.240
<v Speaker 5>but it does put,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>

3806
02:55:05.480 --> 02:55:06.920
<v Speaker 5>they just get mad at you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3807
02:55:06.921 --> 02:55:09.190
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there is a thing of like I,</v>

3808
02:55:09.370 --> 02:55:10.203
<v Speaker 5>and this is where I might just be </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking naive or crazy or one toke over </v>

3809
02:55:14.181 --> 02:55:15.250
<v Speaker 5>the line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sweet.</v>

3810
02:55:15.251 --> 02:55:19.790
<v Speaker 5>But I believe that with any body that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're around,</v>

3811
02:55:19.940 --> 02:55:23.600
<v Speaker 5>if you've cultivated love,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you can really love them,</v>

3812
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:27.560
<v Speaker 5>even in the midst of that cyclone of </v>
<v Speaker 5>bullshit that you're talking about,</v>

3813
02:55:28.010 --> 02:55:31.760
<v Speaker 5>if you could look through the cyclone </v>
<v Speaker 5>right into their soul,</v>

3814
02:55:31.761 --> 02:55:35.270
<v Speaker 5>like into what they are that's love and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see that and love it,</v>

3815
02:55:35.630 --> 02:55:39.440
<v Speaker 5>then the psych clonal start calming down</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little bit right in front of you.</v>

3816
02:55:39.650 --> 02:55:42.710
<v Speaker 5>I think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's possible that if,</v>

3817
02:55:42.711 --> 02:55:43.544
<v Speaker 5>and this is why I think it's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>worth figuring out a way to cultivate </v>

3818
02:55:46.941 --> 02:55:47.774
<v Speaker 5>this shit that you're talking about so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that when you get around a Turd cycline </v>

3819
02:55:50.540 --> 02:55:53.000
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know that you,</v>

3820
02:55:53.060 --> 02:55:53.893
<v Speaker 5>you actually,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you become potentially the person who </v>

3821
02:55:57.801 --> 02:56:00.860
<v Speaker 5>like not by giving them money or giving </v>
<v Speaker 5>them advice,</v>

3822
02:56:01.100 --> 02:56:01.933
<v Speaker 5>but just by giving them love and letting</v>
<v Speaker 5>them be this cyclone of shit for a </v>

3823
02:56:05.661 --> 02:56:09.890
<v Speaker 5>second and loving it for real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You might be the thing that,</v>

3824
02:56:09.950 --> 02:56:14.540
<v Speaker 5>that just like musk's fucking tesla hits</v>
<v Speaker 5>the media or in sends it into earth,</v>

3825
02:56:14.750 --> 02:56:15.583
<v Speaker 5>you might be the thing that dings the </v>
<v Speaker 5>media or of their life and prevents the </v>

3826
02:56:18.561 --> 02:56:20.600
<v Speaker 5>catastrophe that they were spinning </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards.</v>

3827
02:56:20.690 --> 02:56:21.523
<v Speaker 8>It's entirely possible,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's also entirely possible that </v>

3828
02:56:23.571 --> 02:56:27.050
<v Speaker 8>like most things in life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you need a lot of various elements.</v>

3829
02:56:27.051 --> 02:56:28.730
<v Speaker 8>You don't just need one person,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right,</v>

3830
02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:31.190
<v Speaker 8>that you cling to.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You mean to look at humanity as a whole.</v>

3831
02:56:31.191 --> 02:56:32.024
<v Speaker 8>You need to seek inspiration in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>great work of others and you need to </v>

3832
02:56:34.401 --> 02:56:38.720
<v Speaker 8>look at yourself in a way that you think</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe perhaps other people look at you.</v>

3833
02:56:38.810 --> 02:56:39.643
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that is something that a lot of </v>

3834
02:56:40.071 --> 02:56:40.904
<v Speaker 8>people don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And that lack of introspection and self </v>

3835
02:56:43.641 --> 02:56:46.220
<v Speaker 8>critical thinking is one of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 8>why people don't change.</v>

3836
02:56:46.340 --> 02:56:47.690
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Cause they don't adjust.</v>

3837
02:56:47.760 --> 02:56:48.593
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like you're not the guy you were 10 </v>

3838
02:56:50.151 --> 02:56:51.800
<v Speaker 8>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've known you for a long time.</v>

3839
02:56:51.801 --> 02:56:54.260
<v Speaker 8>You're a better version because you've </v>
<v Speaker 8>adjusted.</v>

3840
02:56:54.280 --> 02:56:55.760
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean not that you were bad then.</v>

3841
02:56:55.761 --> 02:56:57.890
<v Speaker 8>I love you back then you were awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But you're,</v>

3842
02:56:58.030 --> 02:57:01.670
<v Speaker 8>you're a more together,</v>
<v Speaker 8>more philosophical,</v>

3843
02:57:01.850 --> 02:57:05.570
<v Speaker 8>more at ease with yourself person than </v>
<v Speaker 8>you were 10 15 years ago.</v>

3844
02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:07.640
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like when we were living together and I,</v>

3845
02:57:07.790 --> 02:57:10.910
<v Speaker 8>we lived together when you were at a </v>
<v Speaker 8>down spot.</v>

3846
02:57:11.330 --> 02:57:12.950
<v Speaker 8>You're a totally different human now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3847
02:57:13.310 --> 02:57:13.881
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Because you are like in those moments </v>

3850

02:57:50.051 --> 02:57:53.180
<v Speaker 5>were doing that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like in my head resisting.</v>

3866
02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:54.100
<v Speaker 5>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3867
02:57:54.250 --> 02:57:55.083
<v Speaker 5>but that's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you decide to help somebody and </v>

3868
02:57:58.391 --> 02:58:02.370
<v Speaker 5>that way you can't expect it's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's shift or change.</v>

3869
02:58:02.371 --> 02:58:05.760
<v Speaker 5>It's going to happen instantaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because of that,</v>

3870
02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:09.510
<v Speaker 5>I still to this day when I put on Elliot</v>
<v Speaker 5>Smith,</v>

3871
02:58:10.290 --> 02:58:11.920
<v Speaker 5>I think at that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

3872
02:58:12.150 --> 02:58:14.840
<v Speaker 5>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hear your voice in my head going to</v>

3873
02:58:14.900 --> 02:58:15.733
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he it,</v>

3874
02:58:15.840 --> 02:58:19.490
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you know what I mean?</v>

3875
02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:20.460
<v Speaker 5>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because,</v>

3876
02:58:20.461 --> 02:58:24.060
<v Speaker 5>and I'll tell you why man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because sometimes when you can listen to</v>

3877
02:58:24.061 --> 02:58:27.590
<v Speaker 5>Elliot Smith and not be wallowing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just really pretty and sweet,</v>

3878
02:58:28.050 --> 02:58:31.290
<v Speaker 5>but don't listen to that shit if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>wallowing because it's like,</v>

3879
02:58:31.291 --> 02:58:31.670
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3880
02:58:31.670 --> 02:58:32.920
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>won't feed the wallet.</v>

3881
02:58:32.980 --> 02:58:34.330
<v Speaker 8>Don't feed the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3882
02:58:34.331 --> 02:58:37.030
<v Speaker 8>Don't feed that wallowing spirit inside </v>
<v Speaker 8>of you.</v>

3883
02:58:37.050 --> 02:58:37.883
<v Speaker 8>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't need to feel that everybody </v>

3884
02:58:39.731 --> 02:58:42.400
<v Speaker 8>experiences loss and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 8>experiences bad moments.</v>

3885
02:58:42.401 --> 02:58:44.680
<v Speaker 8>You just going to you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you never going to get life perfect.</v>

3886
02:58:44.681 --> 02:58:46.600
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So during these bad moments,</v>

3887
02:58:46.601 --> 02:58:48.480
<v Speaker 8>what you got to realize is just </v>
<v Speaker 8>accepted.</v>

3888
02:58:48.490 --> 02:58:50.260
<v Speaker 8>Feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>get through it.</v>

3889
02:58:50.261 --> 02:58:52.450
<v Speaker 8>Realize it's a journey that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 8>to get through.</v>

3890
02:58:52.451 --> 02:58:53.284
<v Speaker 8>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>realize that there's better ways to </v>

3891
02:58:55.121 --> 02:58:58.420
<v Speaker 8>navigate it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then some and some ways are really bad.</v>

3892
02:58:58.430 --> 02:58:59.263
<v Speaker 8>The is a really bad way to navigate it </v>
<v Speaker 8>and started doing heroin and start </v>

3893
02:59:01.691 --> 02:59:05.410
<v Speaker 8>fucking listen to Elliot Smith ago </v>
<v Speaker 8>holding a knife over your stomach in the</v>

3894
02:59:05.411 --> 02:59:08.350
<v Speaker 8>middle of your fucking bedroom going,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fuck it man.</v>

3895
02:59:08.650 --> 02:59:10.160
<v Speaker 8>Fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>

3896
02:59:10.180 --> 02:59:11.830
<v Speaker 8>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can't do that.</v>

3897
02:59:11.860 --> 02:59:13.330
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can look him,</v>

3898
02:59:13.390 --> 02:59:16.150
<v Speaker 8>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not the healthiest way to go.</v>

3899
02:59:16.151 --> 02:59:19.900
<v Speaker 8>That's going to give people around you </v>
<v Speaker 8>and you yourself the most joy.</v>

3900
02:59:20.390 --> 02:59:23.530
<v Speaker 8>It's not necessarily selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's self indulgent for sure.</v>

3901
02:59:23.740 --> 02:59:25.450
<v Speaker 8>I don't necessarily think it's selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it's just,</v>

3902
02:59:25.451 --> 02:59:26.284
<v Speaker 8>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a pattern of behavior that you can </v>

3903
02:59:28.391 --> 02:59:29.480
<v Speaker 8>get trapped in.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3904
02:59:29.500 --> 02:59:33.070
<v Speaker 8>And I think we've all been in bad </v>
<v Speaker 8>situations where you just feel like shit</v>

3905
02:59:33.071 --> 02:59:35.710
<v Speaker 8>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you get in a pattern of behavior and you</v>

3906
02:59:35.711 --> 02:59:37.230
<v Speaker 8>feel trapped,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you gotta,</v>

3907
02:59:37.530 --> 02:59:38.363
<v Speaker 8>you gotta learn from other people who've</v>
<v Speaker 8>been through those patterns and learn </v>

3908
02:59:41.231 --> 02:59:42.930
<v Speaker 8>from your own experiences getting </v>
<v Speaker 8>through pat.</v>

3909
02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:44.020
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cause you get you,</v>

3910
02:59:44.021 --> 02:59:48.160
<v Speaker 5>well that's the thing man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like when you get around someone,</v>

3911
02:59:48.370 --> 02:59:50.960
<v Speaker 5>he's like a teacher figure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you early,</v>

3912
02:59:50.961 --> 02:59:51.794
<v Speaker 5>you get around somebody know that he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like really doing it from love and not </v>

3913
02:59:53.891 --> 02:59:56.200
<v Speaker 5>trying to fucking like fuck with you </v>
<v Speaker 5>because that's,</v>

3914
02:59:56.380 --> 02:59:59.000
<v Speaker 5>that can happen the worst or be superior</v>
<v Speaker 5>to you or,</v>

3915
02:59:59.001 --> 02:59:59.610
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

3916
02:59:59.610 --> 03:00:01.270
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pull you down and yeah.</v>

3917
03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:02.133
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3918
03:00:03.101 --> 03:00:05.110
<v Speaker 5>who's like doing it out of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of love.</v>

3919
03:00:05.380 --> 03:00:10.380
<v Speaker 5>There is such a massive difference in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>

3920
03:00:10.961 --> 03:00:11.794
<v Speaker 5>in the way that feels and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what they do quite often or what a </v>

3921
03:00:15.281 --> 03:00:16.114
<v Speaker 5>lot of my teachers do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is really fucking cool because </v>

3922
03:00:18.341 --> 03:00:20.520
<v Speaker 5>like in the same way you've seen me kind</v>
<v Speaker 5>of go shift,</v>

3923
03:00:20.880 --> 03:00:21.713
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of my teachers from the Rom dies </v>

3924
03:00:22.780 --> 03:00:23.613
<v Speaker 5>camp like in the beginning when I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>actively trying to offend them because </v>

3925
03:00:27.191 --> 03:00:28.024
<v Speaker 5>that was what I would try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it'd be funny not be funny </v>

3926
03:00:30.311 --> 03:00:34.240
<v Speaker 5>cause I was thinking if I can offend </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people about the practice,</v>

3927
03:00:34.241 --> 03:00:36.040
<v Speaker 5>they're teaching me and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

3928
03:00:36.041 --> 03:00:39.400
<v Speaker 5>you can't say that or that's blasphemy </v>
<v Speaker 5>or anything like that.</v>

3929
03:00:39.610 --> 03:00:41.680
<v Speaker 5>Then I know to get the fuck out of there</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause it's like,</v>

3930
03:00:42.100 --> 03:00:43.270
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because you were,</v>

3931
03:00:43.271 --> 03:00:45.300
<v Speaker 5>you were calculated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck yeah.</v>

3932
03:00:45.310 --> 03:00:47.680
<v Speaker 5>Is calculated with one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was one of my teachers.</v>

3933
03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:48.553
<v Speaker 5>Ragu,</v>

3934
03:00:49.010 --> 03:00:50.820
<v Speaker 8>his name's Ragu.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like the spaghetti sauce.</v>

3935

<v Speaker 8>It means a different thing in the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it does change your name Bro.</v>

<v Speaker 8>my name's spaghettios but listen bro,</v>

3937
03:00:58.040 --> 03:01:02.380
<v Speaker 8>don't think about it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And my master spaghettios taught me,</v>

3938
03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:03.790
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck did you just,</v>

<v Speaker 5>He's amazing.</v>

3940
03:01:06.240 --> 03:01:09.690
<v Speaker 5>And like in the same sauce the same way </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're doing that with the garlic,</v>

3941
03:01:10.110 --> 03:01:10.943
<v Speaker 5>the same way you're doing that with him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would try to do that with like their </v>

3942
03:01:13.141 --> 03:01:14.250
<v Speaker 5>teachers and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

3943
03:01:14.251 --> 03:01:14.660
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

3944
03:01:14.660 --> 03:01:16.680
<v Speaker 5>and I would try to do that too because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>

3945
03:01:16.681 --> 03:01:17.514
<v Speaker 5>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they get mad at me right then I know </v>

3946
03:01:20.190 --> 03:01:23.140
<v Speaker 5>then who cares if there's a thing where </v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like blasphemy,</v>

3947
03:01:23.160 --> 03:01:24.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't like the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can blast fee,</v>

3948
03:01:24.751 --> 03:01:26.430
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that freaks me the fuck out.</v>

3949
03:01:26.640 --> 03:01:29.340
<v Speaker 5>But it was like when named Karoli Baba,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3950
03:01:29.341 --> 03:01:30.600
<v Speaker 5>they tell me these stories and I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3951
03:01:30.601 --> 03:01:31.650
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't,</v>

3952
03:01:32.280 --> 03:01:34.650
<v Speaker 5>I just don't really believe that man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I don't know if that it's,</v>

3953
03:01:34.680 --> 03:01:37.250
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if I believed that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And rog you,</v>

3954
03:01:37.251 --> 03:01:38.084
<v Speaker 5>I still remember saying that walking in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this at the retreat with him in Hawaii </v>

3955
03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:42.720
<v Speaker 5>and he gets a big smile on his face.</v>

3956
03:01:42.720 --> 03:01:43.553
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3957
03:01:43.950 --> 03:01:44.783
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't blame you for not believing in </v>

3958
03:01:45.421 --> 03:01:46.410
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

3959
03:01:46.411 --> 03:01:47.850
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cool man,</v>

3960
03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:51.150
<v Speaker 5>this is fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's that.</v>

3961
03:01:51.330 --> 03:01:53.820
<v Speaker 5>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so when you get around a real teacher,</v>

3962
03:01:53.970 --> 03:01:56.340
<v Speaker 5>what I'm saying is the place that you're</v>
<v Speaker 5>at,</v>

3963
03:01:56.820 --> 03:01:57.653
<v Speaker 5>they let you be there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they're not like in the sense that </v>

3964
03:02:01.381 --> 03:02:03.900
<v Speaker 5>they're letting you do the pattern that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in.</v>

3965
03:02:04.230 --> 03:02:05.063
<v Speaker 5>But by allowing that to happen in its </v>
<v Speaker 5>own way and then adding to it the </v>

3966
03:02:08.131 --> 03:02:11.730
<v Speaker 5>intention of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm going to help you grow here.</v>

3967
03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:15.480
<v Speaker 5>That's when you really start changing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not when someone's like you,</v>

3968
03:02:15.481 --> 03:02:16.314
<v Speaker 5>when you were in the car and listen to </v>
<v Speaker 5>Elliot Smith and you were fucking </v>

3969
03:02:19.231 --> 03:02:24.120
<v Speaker 5>recognizing in me a lot of sadness and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of fucked up Nez.</v>

3970
03:02:24.630 --> 03:02:26.820
<v Speaker 5>You weren't scolding me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

3971
03:02:26.850 --> 03:02:27.683
<v Speaker 5>you are giving me love.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But the way you were giving me what I </v>

3972
03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:33.240
<v Speaker 5>love was by making fun of me in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>really sweet way.</v>

3973
03:02:33.300 --> 03:02:35.220
<v Speaker 5>And it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3974
03:02:35.221 --> 03:02:36.001
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>

3975
03:02:36.001 --> 03:02:38.430
<v Speaker 5>So that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what a real teacher does.</v>

3976
03:02:38.431 --> 03:02:40.230
<v Speaker 5>And that's why it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3977
03:02:40.231 --> 03:02:41.064
<v Speaker 5>it took to learn how to get to that spot</v>
<v Speaker 5>is one of the most important things you </v>

3978
03:02:44.851 --> 03:02:45.684
<v Speaker 5>could do.</v>

3979
03:02:46.010 --> 03:02:49.480
<v Speaker 8>Also from a selfish standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3980
03:02:49.550 --> 03:02:50.383
<v Speaker 8>when you have a good friend that is all </v>
<v Speaker 8>sudden looking for a place to live and </v>

3981
03:02:54.141 --> 03:02:56.240
<v Speaker 8>then they could live with you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's cool,</v>

3982
03:02:56.241 --> 03:02:57.074
<v Speaker 8>it's far right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But it also feels really good to help </v>

3983
03:02:59.751 --> 03:03:02.630
<v Speaker 8>some money to help somebody that you </v>
<v Speaker 8>love and you really care about.</v>

3984
03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:03.733
<v Speaker 8>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't even think I thought about it </v>

3985
03:03:05.781 --> 03:03:06.614
<v Speaker 8>for three seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you called me up and you were in a </v>

3986
03:03:08.601 --> 03:03:09.291
<v Speaker 8>hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 8>dude.</v>

3991
03:03:15.921 --> 03:03:18.050
<v Speaker 8>You never have to worry about having a </v>
<v Speaker 8>place to live.</v>

3992
03:03:18.380 --> 03:03:20.030
<v Speaker 8>I wanted you to,</v>

<v Speaker 8>I've had a lot of people that have </v>

3994
03:03:23.871 --> 03:03:26.570
<v Speaker 8>offered the tank to anytime you want,</v>
<v Speaker 8>come on by,</v>

3995
03:03:26.571 --> 03:03:27.404

3996
03:03:27.890 --> 03:03:31.160
<v Speaker 8>You were the only guy who use it on a </v>
<v Speaker 8>regular basis.</v>

3997
03:03:31.161 --> 03:03:31.994
<v Speaker 8>Like when it tate live with me.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He didn't touch that fucking crazy </v>

3998
03:03:34.401 --> 03:03:35.510
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's like,</v>

3999
03:03:35.511 --> 03:03:37.940
<v Speaker 8>fuck this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He might've gotten in there once,</v>

4000
03:03:37.941 --> 03:03:41.060
<v Speaker 8>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but that was not his style at the time,</v>

4001
03:03:41.090 --> 03:03:41.923
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>But you were in there all the time and </v>

4002
03:03:43.191 --> 03:03:45.230
<v Speaker 8>you were writing journals and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you get out of,</v>

4003
03:03:45.300 --> 03:03:46.133
<v Speaker 8>then we would talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You would talk about your inner voyage </v>

4004
03:03:48.950 --> 03:03:52.630
<v Speaker 8>when you'd go in that tank and just </v>
<v Speaker 8>think about your life and how you,</v>

4005
03:03:52.660 --> 03:03:53.493
<v Speaker 8>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

4006
03:03:53.500 --> 03:03:54.333
<v Speaker 8>well what you're doing and what happened</v>
<v Speaker 8>and what went wrong and where were you </v>

4007
03:03:57.350 --> 03:03:58.183
<v Speaker 8>to and</v>

4008
03:03:58.370 --> 03:03:59.360
<v Speaker 2>just look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

4009
03:03:59.630 --> 03:04:04.630
<v Speaker 2>The fucking stress of trying to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professional comic is it fucks.</v>

4010
03:04:05.661 --> 03:04:09.650
<v Speaker 2>You know how I know it fucks you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it fucks me every two years,</v>

4011
03:04:09.950 --> 03:04:10.783
<v Speaker 2>every two years when I abandoned my act </v>
<v Speaker 2>and put out a special and I'd have to </v>

4012
03:04:13.761 --> 03:04:16.100
<v Speaker 2>write a whole new one and a goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>sweating.</v>

4013
03:04:16.101 --> 03:04:16.934
<v Speaker 2>Just thinking about it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Thompson girls gone through that </v>

4014
03:04:18.981 --> 03:04:19.671
<v Speaker 2>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

4015
03:04:19.671 --> 03:04:21.230
<v Speaker 2>he's going through that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

4016
03:04:21.410 --> 03:04:24.440
<v Speaker 2>that's the shedding of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all you've got.</v>

4017
03:04:24.830 --> 03:04:28.070
<v Speaker 2>And then you've got to start from </v>
<v Speaker 2>scratch to fucking terrifying again.</v>

4018
03:04:28.071 --> 03:04:30.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's the thing that makes you keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>growing.</v>

4019
03:04:30.790 --> 03:04:33.260
<v Speaker 2>The thing that makes you keep growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you're,</v>

4020
03:04:33.490 --> 03:04:34.323
<v Speaker 2>when you haven't had any success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you were in the beginning of </v>

4021
03:04:36.921 --> 03:04:38.840
<v Speaker 2>your career and it just hadn't happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>

4022
03:04:38.841 --> 03:04:40.820
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really believe it can happen.</v>

4023
03:04:41.270 --> 03:04:43.940
<v Speaker 2>But once you do have it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you go,</v>

4024
03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:45.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

4025
03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:46.570
<v Speaker 2>Just gotta get through that</v>

4026
03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:47.633
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The thing you're talking about with the </v>

4027
03:04:49.380 --> 03:04:50.190
<v Speaker 5>comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

4028
03:04:50.190 --> 03:04:53.370
<v Speaker 5>it applies to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's like the,</v>

4029
03:04:53.660 --> 03:04:56.700
<v Speaker 5>it's because what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's always telling me,</v>

4030
03:04:56.701 --> 03:05:01.050
<v Speaker 5>like if a snake doesn't successfully </v>
<v Speaker 5>shed its skin,</v>

4031
03:05:01.500 --> 03:05:03.300
<v Speaker 5>it dies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4032
03:05:03.330 --> 03:05:04.230
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that,</v>

4033
03:05:04.620 --> 03:05:05.453
<v Speaker 5>so a person is the same way in the sense</v>
<v Speaker 5>that many of us clean to ways that we </v>

4034
03:05:12.391 --> 03:05:16.380
<v Speaker 5>were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's who we still are when we're not.</v>

4035
03:05:16.530 --> 03:05:17.291
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

4036
03:05:17.291 --> 03:05:18.124
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you have to learn what parts of </v>

4037
03:05:20.821 --> 03:05:22.920
<v Speaker 5>yourself you to let go of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

4038
03:05:23.100 --> 03:05:25.740
<v Speaker 5>and you have to have the guts to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 5>let go of it.</v>

4039
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:29.850
<v Speaker 5>And Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is one of the craziest things.</v>

4040
03:05:29.851 --> 03:05:33.930
<v Speaker 5>When you really have a thing that you've</v>
<v Speaker 5>become attached to,</v>

4041
03:05:34.360 --> 03:05:36.810
<v Speaker 5>for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a relationship that sucks.</v>

4042
03:05:36.811 --> 03:05:40.500
<v Speaker 5>You end up in a bad relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 5>bad job.</v>

4043
03:05:40.770 --> 03:05:45.000
<v Speaker 5>You end up just come attached to some </v>
<v Speaker 5>version of yourself that you just aren't</v>

4044
03:05:45.001 --> 03:05:45.390
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>

4045
03:05:45.390 --> 03:05:46.800
<v Speaker 5>That's not who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4046
03:05:47.490 --> 03:05:49.590
<v Speaker 5>You got to let go of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to let go of it.</v>

4047
03:05:49.620 --> 03:05:50.000
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

4048
03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:53.700
<v Speaker 5>and letting go of it is death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a form of death.</v>

4049
03:05:53.730 --> 03:05:57.330
<v Speaker 5>It feels like death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so people want to avoid it.</v>

4050
03:05:57.331 --> 03:05:58.164
<v Speaker 5>And what ends up happening is you run </v>
<v Speaker 5>into people who are just fucking don't </v>

4051
03:06:01.411 --> 03:06:02.244
<v Speaker 5>even realize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did their valets covered in bags from </v>

4052
03:06:06.901 --> 03:06:07.734
<v Speaker 5>all these preview.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're hoarders and they won't let go </v>

4053
03:06:09.751 --> 03:06:13.290
<v Speaker 5>of all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all these ways they used to be.</v>

4054
03:06:13.500 --> 03:06:15.330
<v Speaker 5>So that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4055
03:06:15.331 --> 03:06:16.830
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

4056
03:06:16.950 --> 03:06:20.730
<v Speaker 5>what I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've learned is that through this act of</v>

4057
03:06:20.731 --> 03:06:22.980
<v Speaker 5>like scanning the south are looking into</v>
<v Speaker 5>this south,</v>

4058
03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:28.020
<v Speaker 5>you'll find places where you're stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you're stuck.</v>

4059
03:06:28.021 --> 03:06:29.190
<v Speaker 5>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were saying,</v>

4060
03:06:29.191 --> 03:06:30.570
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get jealous.</v>

4061
03:06:30.571 --> 03:06:33.120
<v Speaker 5>I was getting jealous of these people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was getting jealous.</v>

4062
03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:34.440
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were stuck there.</v>

4063
03:06:34.440 --> 03:06:36.840
<v Speaker 5>That was the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't just Joe's worse than that.</v>

4064
03:06:37.140 --> 03:06:39.900
<v Speaker 5>It was a toxic or it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't like them.</v>

4065
03:06:40.200 --> 03:06:41.070
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mad at them.</v>

4066
03:06:41.100 --> 03:06:42.570
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you were stuck.</v>

4067
03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:43.423
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you are attached and you were like </v>

4068
03:06:44.881 --> 03:06:48.030
<v Speaker 5>in that attachment was making you </v>
<v Speaker 5>unhappy,</v>

4069
03:06:48.090 --> 03:06:49.110
<v Speaker 5>miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>heavy,</v>

<v Speaker 5>we felt weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well those were really bothered because </v>

4073
03:06:54.960 --> 03:06:57.490
<v Speaker 5>all the energy that's being put in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they carry no,</v>

4074
03:06:57.690 --> 03:06:59.280
<v Speaker 5>in my judgment of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>and then you go to a misuse and that,</v>

4085
03:07:18.870 --> 03:07:22.920
<v Speaker 5>that moment when the thing finally gives</v>
<v Speaker 5>way and you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>lives,</v>

4092
03:07:35.611 --> 03:07:40.611
<v Speaker 5>they're repeating suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a karmic muscle spasm.</v>

4093
03:07:40.920 --> 03:07:42.030
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it's like,</v>

4094
03:07:42.031 --> 03:07:46.590
<v Speaker 5>until you literally push into it and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>same way you get rid of a muscle spasm,</v>

4095
03:07:46.740 --> 03:07:47.573
<v Speaker 5>it fucking hurts man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Until you like get the blood flow going </v>

4096
03:07:50.671 --> 03:07:55.671
<v Speaker 5>back into that place and really fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>go deep into why do I get jealous?</v>

4097
03:07:56.940 --> 03:07:57.840
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for me,</v>

4098
03:07:58.020 --> 03:08:01.170
<v Speaker 5>the thing I just figured out or that's </v>
<v Speaker 5>haunted me,</v>

4099
03:08:01.171 --> 03:08:03.360
<v Speaker 5>it's just jealousy in relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

4100
03:08:03.361 --> 03:08:07.080
<v Speaker 5>why do I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is this?</v>

4101
03:08:07.290 --> 03:08:09.420
<v Speaker 5>This is just like you're saying it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>weak.</v>

4102
03:08:09.600 --> 03:08:12.090
<v Speaker 5>It's not a good look.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like it.</v>

4103
03:08:12.091 --> 03:08:13.950
<v Speaker 5>And it's indulgent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like while you're doing it,</v>

4104
03:08:13.951 --> 03:08:15.510
<v Speaker 5>you realize it's gross.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4105
03:08:15.511 --> 03:08:16.830
<v Speaker 5>And You keep doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4106
03:08:16.831 --> 03:08:17.611
<v Speaker 5>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

4107
03:08:17.611 --> 03:08:18.780
<v Speaker 5>I'm being a bitch and I'm gonna keep </v>
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>

4108
03:08:19.350 --> 03:08:22.920
<v Speaker 5>You fucking texted him first.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

4109
03:08:22.980 --> 03:08:23.813
<v Speaker 5>That Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that it's so humiliating and so </v>

4110
03:08:25.801 --> 03:08:30.150
<v Speaker 5>embarrassing and so fucked up and so </v>
<v Speaker 5>brutal to the person you're with.</v>

4111
03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:35.760
<v Speaker 5>So like that thing I figured,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I figured out a lat,</v>

4112
03:08:36.270 --> 03:08:37.550
<v Speaker 5>am I say let it go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

4113
03:08:37.551 --> 03:08:38.780
<v Speaker 5>it's the illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

4114
03:08:38.790 --> 03:08:40.920
<v Speaker 5>not putting out there that you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>conquer,</v>

4115
03:08:40.921 --> 03:08:41.754
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eternally parts of your identity or </v>

4116
03:08:43.111 --> 03:08:43.944
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I've been able to let that go and </v>

4117
03:08:46.261 --> 03:08:48.450
<v Speaker 5>that feeling of really being able to let</v>
<v Speaker 5>it go,</v>

4118
03:08:49.020 --> 03:08:50.610
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

4119
03:08:50.790 --> 03:08:52.410
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me,</v>

4120
03:08:52.450 --> 03:08:56.190
<v Speaker 5>that's one of those monumental things </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you can start dropping these things</v>

4121
03:08:56.550 --> 03:08:59.940
<v Speaker 5>and it's different for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everybody's got their own fucking muscle</v>

4122
03:08:59.941 --> 03:09:03.150
<v Speaker 5>spasm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you'll know what it is.</v>

4123
03:09:03.270 --> 03:09:05.490
<v Speaker 5>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any people listening to it right now,</v>

4124
03:09:05.491 --> 03:09:08.460
<v Speaker 5>you know what it fucking is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are incredibly,</v>

4125
03:09:08.780 --> 03:09:09.710
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we,</v>

4126
03:09:09.711 --> 03:09:12.570
<v Speaker 5>we are incredibly susceptible to </v>
<v Speaker 5>patterns incredibly.</v>

4127
03:09:12.570 --> 03:09:13.380
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4128
03:09:13.380 --> 03:09:16.320
<v Speaker 5>And if you have a pattern of weakness </v>
<v Speaker 5>and you accept it over and over again,</v>

4129
03:09:16.890 --> 03:09:20.220
<v Speaker 5>it can define you and you have to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>really careful that he got it.</v>

4130
03:09:20.250 --> 03:09:20.791
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

4131
03:09:20.791 --> 03:09:22.680
<v Speaker 5>And but in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's the beauty of it though,</v>

4132
03:09:22.710 --> 03:09:26.400
<v Speaker 5>is the very fucking thing that's hurting</v>
<v Speaker 5>you like that.</v>

4133
03:09:27.090 --> 03:09:30.330
<v Speaker 5>It's also simultaneously the thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's like your,</v>

4134
03:09:30.820 --> 03:09:32.820
<v Speaker 5>it's your fuel for improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

4135
03:09:32.821 --> 03:09:33.654
<v Speaker 5>It's like you're turning your trap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is such a cheesy thing that I </v>

4136
03:09:36.091 --> 03:09:36.924
<v Speaker 5>thought I said that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that I'm never going to like make it a </v>

4137
03:09:38.371 --> 03:09:39.204
<v Speaker 5>blog post or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I forget me if I did think about </v>

4138
03:09:41.101 --> 03:09:41.934
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's turning your trap into a </v>

4139
03:09:43.081 --> 03:09:46.020
<v Speaker 5>trampoline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like you find this fucking,</v>

4140
03:09:46.021 --> 03:09:47.900
<v Speaker 5>you have a self help speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I need,</v>

4141
03:09:48.010 --> 03:09:48.843
<v Speaker 5>see right now in a theater,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that's like a big screen behind </v>

4142
03:09:52.141 --> 03:09:53.740
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's trying your tread happen.</v>

4143
03:09:57.860 --> 03:09:58.693
<v Speaker 5>I knew that's why he has it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I deserved to be made fun of for it and </v>

4144
03:10:00.071 --> 03:10:02.800
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to ever use that in a book</v>
<v Speaker 5>or in a blog post or anything,</v>

4145
03:10:03.040 --> 03:10:03.873
<v Speaker 5>but I really do like the concept of like</v>
<v Speaker 5>finding the place you're stuck and </v>

4146
03:10:07.691 --> 03:10:10.900
<v Speaker 5>realizing that that's not a place you </v>
<v Speaker 5>should avert your eyes from,</v>

4147
03:10:11.170 --> 03:10:14.140
<v Speaker 5>but in fact more than likely that's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>door,</v>

4148
03:10:14.230 --> 03:10:15.850
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a fucking door.</v>

4149
03:10:15.880 --> 03:10:16.713
<v Speaker 5>And you can go through that door into a </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole new existence where you're no </v>

4150
03:10:20.171 --> 03:10:24.820
<v Speaker 5>longer horrified by yourself and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>that is really exciting.</v>

4151
03:10:24.821 --> 03:10:27.640
<v Speaker 5>It's really fucking wonderful moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

4152
03:10:27.641 --> 03:10:30.310
<v Speaker 5>not just in comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I think in anything</v>

4153
03:10:30.410 --> 03:10:32.390
<v Speaker 8>it's always a powerful thing to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's a,</v>

4154
03:10:32.410 --> 03:10:33.243
<v Speaker 8>that's one of the things that's good </v>
<v Speaker 8>about doing things that you're not good </v>

4155
03:10:35.091 --> 03:10:35.924
<v Speaker 8>at.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

4156
03:10:36.050 --> 03:10:36.883
<v Speaker 8>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you get the opportunity to see what </v>

4157
03:10:38.391 --> 03:10:41.090
<v Speaker 8>happens when you work at something and </v>
<v Speaker 8>then you improve.</v>

4158
03:10:41.420 --> 03:10:45.620
<v Speaker 8>And I think that applies to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think if you learn how to play a game,</v>

4159
03:10:45.621 --> 03:10:49.040
<v Speaker 8>you get really good at a game.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think that figuring things out in your</v>

4160
03:10:49.041 --> 03:10:52.280
<v Speaker 8>mind how to get good at this game </v>
<v Speaker 8>applies to life.</v>

4161
03:10:52.310 --> 03:10:53.143
<v Speaker 8>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could get caught up in a game where </v>

4162
03:10:55.491 --> 03:10:58.610
<v Speaker 8>like chess or whatever it is becomes </v>
<v Speaker 8>your whole life and then it's almost too</v>

4163
03:10:58.611 --> 03:10:59.480
<v Speaker 8>much.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

4164
03:10:59.660 --> 03:11:02.980
<v Speaker 8>But you can also use things like chess </v>
<v Speaker 8>or a lot of different things.</v>

4165
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.823
<v Speaker 8>Like we have,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people have a heavy prejudice against </v>

4166
03:11:05.211 --> 03:11:07.010
<v Speaker 8>video games,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but this,</v>

4167
03:11:07.011 --> 03:11:07.844
<v Speaker 8>it's been absolutely proven that video </v>
<v Speaker 8>games can enhance many aspects of the </v>

4168
03:11:11.181 --> 03:11:12.530
<v Speaker 8>way people think and problem solve.</v>

4169
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:15.410
<v Speaker 8>It's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean there's studies don't doing that.</v>

4170
03:11:15.411 --> 03:11:16.244
<v Speaker 8>People are doing on it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we associate video games with </v>

4171
03:11:19.850 --> 03:11:24.120
<v Speaker 8>wasting time slacking off being a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Mimo.</v>

4172
03:11:24.350 --> 03:11:25.183
<v Speaker 8>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck were you just telling me </v>

4173
03:11:26.361 --> 03:11:29.140

<v Speaker 8>guys make when they're playing twitch?</v>

4174
03:11:29.160 --> 03:11:30.800
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4175
03:11:30.801 --> 03:11:31.634

<v Speaker 8>Hundreds of thousands dollars a month </v>

4176
03:11:34.461 --> 03:11:38.000
<v Speaker 8>playing fucking video games.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How has being a lawyer better than that?</v>

4177
03:11:38.001 --> 03:11:40.730
<v Speaker 8>You fucking asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is it about making money?</v>

4178
03:11:41.120 --> 03:11:41.953
<v Speaker 8>What is it about,</v>
<v Speaker 8>cause these twitch guys got you beat </v>

<v Speaker 8>and it's making it way more.</v>

<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Do you understand how crazy that is?</v>

4186
03:12:05.460 --> 03:12:08.440
<v Speaker 5>You're over there working on family law.</v>

<v Speaker 5>but you need to look to that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You could see the how one,</v>

4199
03:12:31.630 --> 03:12:34.060
<v Speaker 5>how it sounds when you hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember when I first heard about it,</v>

4200
03:12:34.061 --> 03:12:35.860
<v Speaker 5>I'm like that there's an unseen mighty </v>
<v Speaker 5>mouse.</v>

4201
03:12:35.861 --> 03:12:37.870
<v Speaker 5>Do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really entertaining.</v>

4202
03:12:37.900 --> 03:12:40.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's really funny and it's like when</v>

4203
03:12:40.991 --> 03:12:41.824
<v Speaker 5>you're looking at like the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the community that forms around these </v>

4204
03:12:44.561 --> 03:12:46.720

<v Speaker 3>It looks at opening ceremonies and soul </v>

4320
03:17:45.021 --> 03:17:47.720
<v Speaker 3>for 2014 legal legends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

4321
03:17:47.930 --> 03:17:49.670
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a football stadium.</v>

4322
03:17:49.700 --> 03:17:52.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a giant soccer stadium so bad.</v>

4323
03:17:52.580 --> 03:17:55.220
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's filled with people.</v>

4324
03:17:55.221 --> 03:17:56.990
<v Speaker 3>That's like 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>people there.</v>

4325
03:17:57.050 --> 03:17:59.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool man.</v>

4326
03:17:59.150 --> 03:18:01.910
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so big in Korea.</v>

4327
03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:04.550
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit Dude.</v>

4328
03:18:04.670 --> 03:18:07.700
<v Speaker 3>All those people look at the size of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>police too.</v>

4329
03:18:07.940 --> 03:18:12.320
<v Speaker 3>Why isn't that caught on like that here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's what overwatch league,</v>

4330
03:18:12.321 --> 03:18:14.330
<v Speaker 3>they just started this week or this </v>
<v Speaker 3>month.</v>

4331
03:18:14.331 --> 03:18:15.440
<v Speaker 3>That's in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Burbank.</v>

4332
03:18:15.441 --> 03:18:17.320
<v Speaker 3>I liked the old Johnny Carson theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh sure.</v>

4333
03:18:17.440 --> 03:18:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's cool dude.</v>

4334
03:18:19.131 --> 03:18:20.110
<v Speaker 3>When I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4335
03:18:20.150 --> 03:18:20.983
<v Speaker 3>addicted to quake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would watch demos all the time from </v>

4336
03:18:23.661 --> 03:18:27.860
<v Speaker 3>this guy named thresh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you could fine thresh quake.</v>

4337
03:18:28.100 --> 03:18:30.410
<v Speaker 3>There was this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

4338
03:18:30.411 --> 03:18:31.640
<v Speaker 3>I wish I remembered his name.</v>

4339
03:18:31.670 --> 03:18:33.530
<v Speaker 3>I think his last name was falling tennis</v>
<v Speaker 3>fong.</v>

4340
03:18:33.531 --> 03:18:34.520
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dennis Fong,</v>

4341
03:18:34.590 --> 03:18:35.423
<v Speaker 3>he was the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And while he was playing before he </v>

4342
03:18:37.611 --> 03:18:38.720
<v Speaker 3>retired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the best.</v>

4343
03:18:38.721 --> 03:18:39.554
<v Speaker 3>Like he was so good that people would </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch his demos and try to emulate his </v>

4344
03:18:43.401 --> 03:18:45.710
<v Speaker 3>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what he would do was he would figure</v>

4345
03:18:45.711 --> 03:18:46.544
<v Speaker 3>out a map like absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He'd have these one on one duels and </v>

4346
03:18:49.781 --> 03:18:50.614
<v Speaker 3>this is another thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>surprisingly complex is playing duals </v>

4347
03:18:54.251 --> 03:18:55.084
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is quake one that we're looking at </v>

4348
03:18:56.231 --> 03:18:57.370
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No it's not.</v>

4349
03:18:57.371 --> 03:18:58.630
<v Speaker 3>It looks like quick three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

4350
03:18:58.631 --> 03:18:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Quick one tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

4351
03:18:59.651 --> 03:19:01.720
<v Speaker 3>it goes at a new version of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

4352
03:19:01.721 --> 03:19:03.310
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely quick one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

4353
03:19:03.490 --> 03:19:04.323
<v Speaker 3>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause you see the shotgun shells and </v>

4354
03:19:05.621 --> 03:19:06.800
<v Speaker 3>shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's all different stuff.</v>

4355
03:19:06.801 --> 03:19:10.030
<v Speaker 3>There's rocket launchers and this didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a rail gun.</v>

4356
03:19:10.031 --> 03:19:12.640
<v Speaker 3>The rail gun changed a lot of shit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>quake two.</v>

4357
03:19:12.640 --> 03:19:13.473
<v Speaker 3>But the point being that you would have </v>
<v Speaker 3>these strategies because you had a map </v>

4358
03:19:17.110 --> 03:19:19.690
<v Speaker 3>and it would all be about controlling </v>
<v Speaker 3>the response.</v>

4359
03:19:19.720 --> 03:19:20.553
<v Speaker 3>So all of the items,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's a rocket launcher or shotgun </v>

4360
03:19:22.811 --> 03:19:24.160
<v Speaker 3>or whatever the fuck it is that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>picking up.</v>

4361
03:19:24.490 --> 03:19:25.480
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ammo,</v>

4362
03:19:25.481 --> 03:19:28.060
<v Speaker 3>all of it would respond as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>health.</v>

4363
03:19:28.210 --> 03:19:31.330
<v Speaker 3>So it was all about controlling where </v>
<v Speaker 3>the respawn is,</v>

4364
03:19:31.331 --> 03:19:32.164
<v Speaker 3>keeping your health up really high and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then making sure your opponent never </v>

4365
03:19:34.931 --> 03:19:37.150
<v Speaker 3>gets any good weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they would,</v>

4366
03:19:37.300 --> 03:19:40.360
<v Speaker 3>it was really strategic and they chase </v>
<v Speaker 3>each other around the map.</v>

4367
03:19:41.080 --> 03:19:44.050
<v Speaker 3>This one dude just fucked everybody up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4368
03:19:44.051 --> 03:19:45.490
<v Speaker 3>and he lost a couple of times too when </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

4369
03:19:45.600 --> 03:19:46.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>starting out.</v>

4370
03:19:46.511 --> 03:19:50.110
<v Speaker 3>But he eventually got to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was like the Michael,</v>

4371
03:19:50.111 --> 03:19:51.130
<v Speaker 3>like the right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

4372
03:19:51.131 --> 03:19:51.701
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's that guy.</v>

4373
03:19:51.701 --> 03:19:52.600
<v Speaker 3>Boom Jackson.</v>

4374
03:19:53.020 --> 03:19:56.140
<v Speaker 3>He knows where you're going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's firing rockets down hallways.</v>

4375
03:19:56.141 --> 03:20:00.370
<v Speaker 3>He anticipates you're going to be going </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and when you would watch these guys</v>

4376
03:20:00.371 --> 03:20:01.930
<v Speaker 3>play it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See like right there,</v>

4377
03:20:01.931 --> 03:20:03.970
<v Speaker 3>that guy was there and he's just waiting</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>

4378
03:20:03.971 --> 03:20:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

4379
03:20:05.620 --> 03:20:06.453
<v Speaker 3>And he just killed the dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I would watch these guys in these </v>

4380
03:20:09.401 --> 03:20:12.430
<v Speaker 3>demos and try to learn from like how </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were maneuvering.</v>

4381
03:20:12.460 --> 03:20:13.293
<v Speaker 3>There's another guy called fatality and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he was really good at it and there was </v>

4382
03:20:17.231 --> 03:20:18.820
<v Speaker 3>different games that guys would play </v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

4383
03:20:18.821 --> 03:20:19.654
<v Speaker 3>There was this game and some guys went </v>
<v Speaker 3>over to unreal and they played unreal </v>

4384
03:20:22.181 --> 03:20:23.014
<v Speaker 3>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got the armor st every time it </v>

4385
03:20:25.091 --> 03:20:25.924
<v Speaker 3>responds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be running back there to </v>

4386
03:20:26.621 --> 03:20:29.140
<v Speaker 3>get that armor running back there to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shotgun shells,</v>

4387
03:20:29.141 --> 03:20:29.974
<v Speaker 3>making sure that his opponent doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a rocket and you just keep killing </v>

4388
03:20:32.321 --> 03:20:33.154
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when he responds he chased him </v>

4389
03:20:34.211 --> 03:20:36.120
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kill him again or weaken them.</v>

4390
03:20:36.130 --> 03:20:40.660
<v Speaker 3>And then these are fucking really </v>
<v Speaker 3>complex multilevel games.</v>

4391
03:20:40.661 --> 03:20:41.494
<v Speaker 3>You have to think in advance and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to plan things out and guys would </v>

4392
03:20:44.621 --> 03:20:45.454
<v Speaker 3>even have timed things that they would </v>
<v Speaker 3>put in a program so that it would show </v>

4393
03:20:49.871 --> 03:20:50.704
<v Speaker 3>on their screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rocket launcher responding and 10 </v>

4394
03:20:52.901 --> 03:20:54.610
<v Speaker 3>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nine Aa.</v>

4395
03:20:55.210 --> 03:20:56.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4396
03:20:56.650 --> 03:21:00.490
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy how when this came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was so bad ass.</v>

4397
03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:03.310
<v Speaker 3>And now it looks so ancient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks weird.</v>

4398
03:21:03.311 --> 03:21:04.570
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but go to quick.</v>

4399
03:21:04.780 --> 03:21:05.613

<v Speaker 3>it's called quake champions.</v>

4402
03:21:12.010 --> 03:21:15.790
<v Speaker 3>There's one you could play online now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's called quake champions.</v>

4403
03:21:18.010 --> 03:21:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Came out last year.</v>

<v Speaker 3>someone and there's these crazy maps.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I get addicted to,</v>

4421
03:22:08.241 --> 03:22:11.120
<v Speaker 3>but I could easily get addicted to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

4422
03:22:11.180 --> 03:22:13.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about turning to a land party room.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4434
03:22:31.310 --> 03:22:34.910
<v Speaker 3>maybe we'd host a server and let a </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of people online.</v>

4435
03:22:34.940 --> 03:22:35.773
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we could have what you call </v>

4436
03:22:36.180 --> 03:22:37.013
<v Speaker 3>deathmatch outcome with death matches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have 10 people on a map and </v>

4437
03:22:39.540 --> 03:22:42.230
<v Speaker 3>they're all just going crazy and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>respond with all your shit.</v>

4438
03:22:42.460 --> 03:22:44.600
<v Speaker 3>Just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what about,</v>

4439
03:22:44.601 --> 03:22:46.310
<v Speaker 3>why don't we pick up a new one like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

4440
03:22:46.311 --> 03:22:50.690
<v Speaker 3>this fucking game in this game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] battlegrounds.</v>

4443
03:22:53.870 --> 03:22:55.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't want real physics.</v>

4444
03:22:55.160 --> 03:22:57.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to move around like are </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving around in real life.</v>

4445
03:22:57.111 --> 03:22:57.944
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about quake cause you </v>
<v Speaker 3>move weight quicker than you do in real </v>

4446
03:22:59.451 --> 03:23:02.410
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're bouncing and jumping.</v>

4447
03:23:02.420 --> 03:23:04.490
<v Speaker 3>You're hitting trampolines and flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the air.</v>

4448
03:23:04.500 --> 03:23:06.350

<v Speaker 3>This is the one I was explaining the </v>
<v Speaker 3>overwatch league.</v>

4460
03:23:34.880 --> 03:23:36.140
<v Speaker 3>This is the viewing of it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can view it,</v>

4462
03:23:38.570 --> 03:23:40.610
<v Speaker 3>but I like watching things through </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's eyes.</v>

4463
03:23:40.640 --> 03:23:41.473
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4466
03:23:45.321 --> 03:23:48.320
<v Speaker 3>This is team based.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should have an overwatch league.</v>

4467
03:23:48.321 --> 03:23:49.154
<v Speaker 3>I suck at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know he's good at it as Pemberton </v>

4468
03:23:50.721 --> 03:23:51.850
<v Speaker 3>you can get pampered.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

4469
03:23:52.180 --> 03:23:54.870
<v Speaker 3>Just look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So is this um,</v>

4470
03:23:54.950 --> 03:23:57.470
<v Speaker 3>something that you played with a pc or </v>
<v Speaker 3>is this an okay,</v>

4471
03:23:57.471 --> 03:23:58.900
<v Speaker 3>I know this one's on all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one,</v>

4472
03:23:59.440 --> 03:24:00.273
<v Speaker 3>I can't play xbox games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you play with a mouse and a </v>

4473
03:24:01.821 --> 03:24:02.654
<v Speaker 3>keyboard that controllers just so wide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're supposed to be making an update </v>

4474
03:24:05.901 --> 03:24:06.830
<v Speaker 3>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can do that.</v>

4475
03:24:06.831 --> 03:24:09.020
<v Speaker 3>Actually a mouse and keyboard on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next box.</v>

4476
03:24:09.080 --> 03:24:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Oh well that's what they should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking.</v>

4477
03:24:11.310 --> 03:24:15.660
<v Speaker 3>So long to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lizard has said there is so bad ass ears</v>

4478
03:24:15.750 --> 03:24:16.440
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>

4479
03:24:16.440 --> 03:24:19.460
<v Speaker 3>There's still a thing like an x box has </v>
<v Speaker 3>said recently they would allow people to</v>

4480
03:24:19.461 --> 03:24:21.740
<v Speaker 3>play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess people on playstation network,</v>

4481
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:25.940
<v Speaker 3>but Sony doesn't want to play friends </v>
<v Speaker 3>with them at Sachs.</v>

4482
03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Well see the thing about computers is </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a mouse and a keyboard,</v>

4483
03:24:30.531 --> 03:24:32.300
<v Speaker 3>you can just have so much more </v>
<v Speaker 3>precision.</v>

4484
03:24:32.600 --> 03:24:35.660
<v Speaker 3>Guys get really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they also have like auto aiming.</v>

4485
03:24:35.750 --> 03:24:38.420
<v Speaker 3>It keeps you in the box when you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>using those.</v>

4486
03:24:38.530 --> 03:24:39.290
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Vicks,</v>

4487
03:24:39.290 --> 03:24:41.750
<v Speaker 3>they've made it a little bit better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's a little hand controllers are</v>

4488
03:24:41.751 --> 03:24:44.430
<v Speaker 3>more accurate than they used be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But man,</v>

4489
03:24:44.431 --> 03:24:47.160
<v Speaker 3>it ain't the same when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you have a mouse and keyboard,</v>

4490
03:24:47.161 --> 03:24:47.994
<v Speaker 3>like if you watch that guy google </v>
<v Speaker 3>fatality in the eye and fatality was a </v>

4491
03:24:52.831 --> 03:24:53.664
<v Speaker 3>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy would hit people with a rail </v>

4492
03:24:56.161 --> 03:25:00.810
<v Speaker 3>gun in the middle of the air so often it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was almost like he was psychic crazy and</v>

4493
03:25:00.811 --> 03:25:04.350
<v Speaker 3>you'd watch him play and you watch </v>
<v Speaker 3>through his eyes and you realize how bad</v>

4494
03:25:04.351 --> 03:25:05.184
<v Speaker 3>you are at the game and that was part of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why I got so addictive made </v>

4495
03:25:07.861 --> 03:25:09.570
<v Speaker 3>it to number one on that new game I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>

4496
03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:12.130
<v Speaker 3>He did his twitch channel says right </v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

4497
03:25:12.140 --> 03:25:13.140
<v Speaker 3>it's not a stream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen play.</v>

4498
03:25:13.500 --> 03:25:14.700
<v Speaker 3>That's him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a savage.</v>

4499
03:25:14.850 --> 03:25:16.620
<v Speaker 3>I met that kid in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very nice car.</v>

4500
03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:17.753
<v Speaker 3>He's not a kid anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure he's in this deep in his </v>

4501
03:25:18.960 --> 03:25:19.793
<v Speaker 3>thirties now I think because it's a long</v>
<v Speaker 3>ass time ago that he was running quake </v>

4502
03:25:23.521 --> 03:25:25.200
<v Speaker 3>unless he was six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There he is.</v>

4503
03:25:25.230 --> 03:25:26.670
<v Speaker 3>He's a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got dad bod,</v>

4504
03:25:27.290 --> 03:25:28.123
<v Speaker 3>got a fucking golf shirt on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dropped his kids off at their </v>

03:25:31.201 --> 03:25:33.090
<v Speaker 3>fucking out people online.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love it man.</v>

4506
03:25:33.091 --> 03:25:36.500
<v Speaker 3>If this is like such a better future </v>
<v Speaker 3>than I predicted when I was a kid,</v>

4507
03:25:36.510 --> 03:25:41.100
<v Speaker 3>like I never imagined that we would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to watch people play video games or</v>

4508
03:25:41.101 --> 03:25:41.934
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you could make a career out of </v>

4509
03:25:42.841 --> 03:25:43.674
<v Speaker 3>playing not just a career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but make more in a month than lawyers </v>

4510
03:25:46.561 --> 03:25:48.590
