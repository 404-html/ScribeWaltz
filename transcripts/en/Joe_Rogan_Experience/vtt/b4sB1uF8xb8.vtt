00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.680
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.030
<v Speaker 1>When I lived in New York,</v>

3
00:00:03.031 --> 00:00:03.960
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend,</v>

4
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.393
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

6
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>one of his friends knew the guy's a fucking cock odd connection,</v>

7
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.381
<v Speaker 1>but it was a,</v>

8
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

9
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>there were all in music business like rock and roll guys.</v>

10
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Like one of them was in this band and he knew a dude who somehow or another new,</v>

11
00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>someone who bought Jackie Gleason's old home and Jackie Gleason.</v>

12
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>This is the story.</v>

13
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Jackie Gleason is obviously third hand,</v>

14
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>it could be total horsemen.</v>

15
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.573
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

16
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>The story was,</v>

17
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>and it's a fun story.</v>

18
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.790
<v Speaker 1>The Jackie Gleason was drinking with Nixon and him and Nixon were buddies and</v>

19
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:36.031
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

20
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:36.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>they're talking football and throwing back some fucking Jack and cokes and a</v>

22
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Nixon's like you want to see a fucking Ufo.</v>

23
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.003
<v Speaker 1>So they get,</v>

24
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>they get an air force one and they fly some military base where they've got a</v>

25
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:54.741
<v Speaker 1>crashed flying saucer and Jackie Gleason from then on becomes a crazy,</v>

26
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>a UFO believer.</v>

27
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.940
<v Speaker 1>And Jackie Gleason has this backyard in upstate New York and he has a fake Ufo</v>

28
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>designed and built in his driveway to replicate the thing that he saw.</v>

29
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>He hires a bunch of people to try to recreate something.</v>

30
00:01:09.751 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>He puts it together in his head,</v>

31
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>sort of like a crime sketch.</v>

32
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Like you would try to reenact it.</v>

33
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Funny Story.</v>

34
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.563
<v Speaker 1>That's the fun.</v>

35
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe it?</v>

36
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I would like to find my,</v>

37
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.640
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

38
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I did fuck up my computer.</v>

39
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:24.834
<v Speaker 1>It's not working.</v>

40
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Luckily I've got backups.</v>

41
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] yeah,</v>

42

43
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you get your slurry mix slurs.</v>

44
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get that chemical that you could just put it on your computer?</v>

45
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.343
<v Speaker 1>Are we good idea?</v>

46
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.060

48
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>But I don't know if Jackie Gleason really did.</v>

49
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you Google it?</v>

50
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Find out did Jackie Gleason a really wasn't really any UFO was Jackie Gleason</v>

51
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:44.034
<v Speaker 1>and the Ufos,</v>

52
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.901
<v Speaker 1>it'll I,</v>

53
00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:45.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

54
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan once said,</v>

55
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I spread my own fucking like the PTO inflation.</v>

56
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I like the story.</v>

57
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll make up a story.</v>

58
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

59
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Not even realize it.</v>

60
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>Made it up.</v>

61
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Put it out there and then I'll find it on Wikipedia and I'll use it as a</v>

62
00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>reference to prove when I tell the story again,</v>

63
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>trip to the alien morgue.</v>

64
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.091
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

65
00:02:03.091 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>So this is a real rumor to the moon,</v>

66
00:02:05.401 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>Alice.</v>

67
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>There was a time when you could say that.</v>

68
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Scroll that down.</v>

69
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.363
<v Speaker 1>Stop,</v>

70
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>go back,</v>

71
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>collaborate and listen.</v>

72
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.063
<v Speaker 1>Stop right there.</v>

73
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>You're fucking drunk as shit,</v>

74
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:16.494
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

75
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

76
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 1>there was another size Jenkins,</v>

77
00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>extremely serious,</v>

78
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure UFO researcher and prided himself on the huge collection of Ufr</v>

79
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] books,</v>

80
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.800
<v Speaker 1>which numbered into the thousands the see I call bullshit.</v>

81
00:02:28.801 --> 00:02:29.634
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

82
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.410
<v Speaker 1>I doubt there's thousands of books written you a false,</v>

83
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.123
<v Speaker 1>put it back up.</v>

84
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>What more could you say?</v>

85
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.610
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

86
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

87
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:36.391
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:36.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>and then he saw light too.</v>

90
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the new title came out,</v>

91
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>even a Europe or the UK,</v>

92
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 1>Jackie had a copy.</v>

93
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.603
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

94
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's true.</v>

96
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

97
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>but that was the store that this guy told me about house.</v>

98
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a dope story.</v>

99
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.431
<v Speaker 1>If that's true,</v>

100
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:57.900
<v Speaker 1>if the Jackie Gleason really was some sort of a crazy UFO fanatic and that</v>

101
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>that's the motivator,</v>

102
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>more match and if it's fucking true,</v>

103
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.581
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

104
00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>it's all true.</v>

105
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>What a beautiful thing it would be if they really did have like a hanger 18 you</v>

106
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>know what I want when we're old and we're sitting on the cove drinking our</v>

107
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>

108
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>looking at the water just mean you gray or silver bags and someone's going to</v>

109
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

110
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.083
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

111
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>fucking Jackie Gleason went to area 51 and saw that shit.</v>

112
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what's going to happen.</v>

113
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.881
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

114
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

115
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if it will happen.</v>

116
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they really do have something.</v>

117
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

118
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.243
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>

119
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.450
<v Speaker 1>I would wish one person who was lid,</v>

120
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>legitimately intelligent who was dying,</v>

121
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:36.990
<v Speaker 1>which spill the beans.</v>

122
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I wish every dude that spills the beans like,</v>

123
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

124
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking Weirdo.</v>

125
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm not my by one chive and with my one thing is how impossible would it be to</v>

126
00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>keep a secret and today it would be too impossible.</v>

127
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:53.861
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

128
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:55.310
<v Speaker 1>One person would say something.</v>

129
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that because they look,</v>

130
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 1>they kept a secret when they were making the Manhattan project,</v>

131
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>but that was a different era.</v>

132
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 1>What one thing I will say,</v>

133
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:08.341
<v Speaker 1>one thing is maybe those movies and TV shows and leaks and everyone,</v>

134
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>because we're all like,</v>

135
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.940
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

136
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>area 51 of course it's the aliens.</v>

137
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe that's,</v>

138
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's part of it.</v>

140
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.251
<v Speaker 1>Well look,</v>

141
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.830
<v Speaker 1>we know that secrets can be kept.</v>

142
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Secrets totally can be kept because we didn't find out about the Gulf of Tonkin</v>

143
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.350
<v Speaker 1>until like way,</v>

144
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:27.184
<v Speaker 1>way late.</v>

145
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Like there was some people involved in the Gulf of Tonkin incident.</v>

146
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.080
<v Speaker 1>When did it become mainstream?</v>

147
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>Now look,</v>

148
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.581
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>

149
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>40 years secrets can be kept.</v>

150
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>But nowadays it's,</v>

152
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

153
00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty deep.</v>

154
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Secrets can be kept out.</v>

155
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't the most important secret be we found aliens.</v>

156
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>That would be like one of the greatest secrets you would ever want to keep.</v>

157
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Like the last thing we want is these motherfuckers just freaking out because</v>

158
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:55.444
<v Speaker 1>there's aliens.</v>

159
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I liked the movies though,</v>

160
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 1>where it's just a given.</v>

161
00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.511
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

162
00:04:58.511 --> 00:04:58.721
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

163
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>well we just got the spaceships from area 51 yeah.</v>

164
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>How many movies in that though?</v>

165
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.013
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>

166
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Most movies when they try to depict what it would be like if we were attacked,</v>

167
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking terrible.</v>

168
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.070
<v Speaker 1>I like the fact that we started off with saving democracy and,</v>

169
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

170
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>you got drunk along the way and so it shifted to alien power.</v>

171
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Standard area.</v>

172
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.033

178
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:30.880

179
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.430

180
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.690

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.880

184
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.930
