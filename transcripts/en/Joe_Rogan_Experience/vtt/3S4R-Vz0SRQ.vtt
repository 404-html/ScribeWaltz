95
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.350
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is because of the,</v>

98
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.241
<v Speaker 3>Ease of access.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

149
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.561
<v Speaker 3>there's benefit.</v>

150
00:04:49.561 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a problem with,</v>

151
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

152
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.490
<v Speaker 3>which was doing everything live.</v>

153
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it ups the ante though.</v>

154
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.771
<v Speaker 3>A lot of these guys,</v>

155
00:04:55.771 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Speaker 3>they edit their shit,</v>

156
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.091
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

157
00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:58.250
<v Speaker 3>they edit their podcast,</v>

158
00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.550
<v Speaker 3>the hand,</v>

159
00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.620
<v Speaker 3>like musical cues and all that stuff and they make it all professional and the</v>

160
00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:03.090
<v Speaker 3>insert commercials in it.</v>

161
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 3>But you lose something,</v>

162
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:07.590
<v Speaker 3>you lose the live element is part of what makes it fun.</v>

163
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.130
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

164
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

165
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

166
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.930
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

167
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Even when you're listening to afterwards,</v>

168
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.930
<v Speaker 3>you know that it was broadcast live.</v>

169
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.981
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

170
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:15.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a certain energy to that.</v>

171
00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:16.314
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

172
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Because this one was cool.</v>

173
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 2>I've lost track of time and the only thing that was keeping pace with time as I</v>

174
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 2>was getting thirsty or than I should have been</v>

175
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 3>top your Ios Iowasca story.</v>

176
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

177
00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.373
<v Speaker 3>there's no way.</v>

178
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I watched,</v>

179
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.971
<v Speaker 3>I watched a story.</v>

180
00:05:27.971 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 3>It was legendary,</v>

181
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 3>but you talked it,</v>

182

<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

183
00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:30.511

00:05:30.511 --> 00:05:32.020

186
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.393
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do it.</v>

187
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to do that at all.</v>

188
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 3>I was so down and do Iowasca I'm ready,</v>

190
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 3>But I became like was just a feeling like shit afterwards.</v>

191
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.893
<v Speaker 3>Not into it.</v>

192
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I'll get all my growth through other sources.</v>

193
00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.893
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

194
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a major,</v>

195
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a major tool.</v>

196
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is know you're so your close,</v>

197
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:56.860
<v Speaker 2>you need a little tack Hammer.</v>

198
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>This is the fucking wrecking</v>

199
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 3>ball.</v>

200
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.100
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

201
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 3>I think if I got hooked up heroin I'd be so down for it since I'm not on heroin.</v>

202
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I look at and go fuck it.</v>

203
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.943
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

204
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Ed Muskie was the guy that went crazy because hunter s Thompson accused him of</v>

205
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:11.730
<v Speaker 3>being on a Ibogaine</v>

206
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.000
<v Speaker 4>hunter did a lot of stuff,</v>

207
00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 4>but he must not have done a lot of aggregate cause just can't,</v>

208
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:18.983
<v Speaker 3>is it possible?</v>

209
00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.920
<v Speaker 3>We did on acid,</v>

210
00:06:19.921 --> 00:06:20.610
<v Speaker 3>which was interesting.</v>

211
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 3>He had a very weird reaction on acid.</v>

212
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 3>He would like throw a fucking shoes through windows and stuff and screaming.</v>

213
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.760
<v Speaker 3>People want to get his guns.</v>

214
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.643
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>

215
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.491
<v Speaker 3>We had a very,</v>

216
00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

217
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.170
<v Speaker 3>cause the way his mind works,</v>

218
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.640
<v Speaker 3>it worked was very strange.</v>

219
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.391
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

220
00:06:33.391 --> 00:06:37.170
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting because that kind of was like there in the 60s he was there and</v>

221
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.230
<v Speaker 3>the hippie generation of the San Francisco Movement,</v>

222
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.921
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

223
00:06:40.921 --> 00:06:41.201
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

224
00:06:41.201 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

225
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:42.600
<v Speaker 3>the summer of love and all that,</v>

226
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:45.390
<v Speaker 3>he was there to watch like literally like that,</v>

227
00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:45.960
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>

228
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.410
<v Speaker 3>what everybody at the time thought was the changing of an age,</v>

229
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.891
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

230
00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:54.210
<v Speaker 3>and he's got this brilliant thing in that documentary where he sort of watched</v>

231
00:06:54.211 --> 00:06:57.600
<v Speaker 3>that happen and then watch the tide roll back,</v>

232
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.231
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

233
00:06:58.231 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 3>and then watch like the Nixon administration afterwards and watch Vietnam after</v>

234
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.570
<v Speaker 3>I lost it all fall away.</v>

235
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.130
<v Speaker 3>And it's really fascinating stuff,</v>

236
00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:05.964
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

237
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.350
<v Speaker 3>He went through some shit,</v>

238
00:07:07.351 --> 00:07:07.591
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

239
00:07:07.591 --> 00:07:09.450
<v Speaker 3>that generation went through some crazy shit.</v>

240
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.220
<v Speaker 4>He went and it was amazing.</v>

241
00:07:11.221 --> 00:07:12.870
<v Speaker 4>The Hudson was legal magazines.</v>

242
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 4>So many of them are still constantly,</v>

243
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

244
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 4>credible.</v>

245
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker 4>Well they're all wears off.</v>

246
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

247
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

248
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.550
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it works and everything does that.</v>

249
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 4>So that's the biggest challenge was all of this work is taking it and applying</v>

250
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:24.134
<v Speaker 4>it to your life.</v>

251
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.161
<v Speaker 4>After you're done,</v>

252
00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 4>it's very easy to get slippery and just kind of forget.</v>

253
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 4>But it's always a move.</v>

254
00:07:29.181 --> 00:07:30.320
<v Speaker 4>So baseline a little bit,</v>

255
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.711
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

256
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:34.880
<v Speaker 4>So where are you retreat to is never quite the same as the way you work.</v>

257
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.313
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

258
00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.323
<v Speaker 4>the quote,</v>

259
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

260
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 4>inspiration works</v>

261
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's like bathing.</v>

262
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

263
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 3>it only lasts for so long.</v>

264
00:07:43.971 --> 00:07:45.060
<v Speaker 3>So we recommended daily.</v>

265
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

266
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

267
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.040
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

268
00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.620
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

269
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.453
<v Speaker 3>I don't know who,</v>

270
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.370
<v Speaker 3>whose quote that is,</v>

271
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.541
<v Speaker 3>but that's a,</v>

272
00:07:50.541 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 3>that's so make sense.</v>

273
00:07:51.591 --> 00:07:51.771
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

274
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:52.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

275
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 3>inspiration doesn't work always.</v>

276
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 3>It's because you need it all at time.</v>

277
00:07:55.221 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 3>You need to like it to be on that correct path.</v>

278
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.700
<v Speaker 3>All the checks the shamans recommend once every two months doing something to</v>

279
00:08:01.701 --> 00:08:02.534
<v Speaker 3>read</v>

280
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 3>a sweat lodge too.</v>

281
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Crazy sweat lodge.</v>

282
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 3>You're ready.</v>

283
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready.</v>

284
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm ready.</v>

285
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:10.041
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

286
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:10.874
<v Speaker 3>I would gain though.</v>

287
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 3>Not Interested.</v>

288
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

289
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:16.621
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

290
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.350
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do a little quick videos and right now I'm here with Matt Packs.</v>

291
00:08:19.351 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 3>Then I'm at water cleaner at [inaudible].</v>

292
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 3>At Twitter you got to go to the Adam Carolla podcast.</v>

293
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.460
<v Speaker 3>So like cheating on me.</v>

366
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.150
<v Speaker 4>That through with me.</v>

367
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.321
<v Speaker 4>The first end of the day,</v>

368
00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:34.980
<v Speaker 4>that's what it was.</v>

369
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 4>What was in the car and then here,</v>

370
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.750
<v Speaker 4>so then it was like a combo for a long ass stretch with no weed whatsoever.</v>

371
00:10:39.751 --> 00:10:40.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

372
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.033
<v Speaker 4>How long did you go?</v>

373
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.993
<v Speaker 4>13 days.</v>

374
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.900
<v Speaker 4>How long has most of the launch you've ever,</v>

375
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.430
<v Speaker 4>I've done and I just went five or six.</v>

376
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:48.271
<v Speaker 4>But this is,</v>

377
00:10:48.271 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 4>I became,</v>

378
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 4>I became a heavy everyday smoker,</v>

379
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Speaker 4>so to do that was really,</v>

380
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:55.220
<v Speaker 4>withdrawal symptoms were weird with the drifts onto the dreams were way,</v>

381
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.123
<v Speaker 4>way bigger.</v>

382
00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.950
<v Speaker 4>But withdrawal symptoms physically like you needed zero,</v>

383
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.030
<v Speaker 4>zero of those.</v>

384
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:01.890
<v Speaker 4>No withdrawals don't get to it in a day.</v>

385
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:03.600
<v Speaker 4>Like if I'm like busy and I'm running around and no,</v>

386
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:04.470
<v Speaker 4>because I don't see any,</v>

387
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't just have a chance to like do something cause I'm not going to work like</v>

388
00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.710
<v Speaker 4>quite to something important.</v>

389
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

390
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 4>this doesn't count.</v>

391
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 4>The only thing I've ever felt physically was,</v>

392
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

393
00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.950
<v Speaker 4>I felt caffeine.</v>

394
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.813
<v Speaker 4>I felt coffee.</v>

395
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh that definitely helped that.</v>

396
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.110
<v Speaker 4>But like when I would take a day off and they get a headache,</v>

397
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:19.600
<v Speaker 4>that's the only,</v>

398
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 4>never felt physical.</v>

399
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:20.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

400
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 4>But with,</v>

401
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 4>with pot,</v>

402
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.760
<v Speaker 4>it was always I,</v>

403
00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

404
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I was tapped to be top 1% users.</v>

405
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.723
<v Speaker 4>Users,</v>

406
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:27.961
<v Speaker 4>there was nothing.</v>

407
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:28.321
<v Speaker 4>It was just like,</v>

408
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:28.930
<v Speaker 4>oh I didn't,</v>

409
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:29.491
<v Speaker 4>that didn't get to it.</v>

410
00:11:29.491 --> 00:11:30.324
<v Speaker 4>You shut it off.</v>

411
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 4>Do you believe people when they say that they have physical withdrawal symptoms</v>

412
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:35.260
<v Speaker 4>or you think that trip man,</v>

413
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 4>I had aspartame withdrawal symptoms,</v>

414
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.943
<v Speaker 4>aspartame</v>

415
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:42.810
<v Speaker 4>to pull over and stop cause I couldn't see any more debilitating.</v>

416
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that aspartame was,</v>

417
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.630
<v Speaker 4>it was addictive.</v>

418
00:11:45.631 --> 00:11:46.464
<v Speaker 4>You ever heard of that?</v>

419
00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's addictive but when I got off it,</v>

420
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:50.670
<v Speaker 4>it was in my system.</v>

421
00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Oh but that's but isn't that also coke?</v>

422
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.690
<v Speaker 4>You would switch from coke.</v>

423
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.240
<v Speaker 4>I switched me coke to um,</v>

424
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:57.770
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

425
00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 4>to sprite once and I was drinking tons of it cause it was get free of the comedy</v>

426
00:12:01.151 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 4>store when I worked there.</v>

427
00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 4>And so because I dropped the caffeine then I got to keep driving migraines too.</v>

428
00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:07.000
<v Speaker 4>But that wasn't her aspartame.</v>

429
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 4>And I started doing a bunch of aspartame when you got the headaches because I</v>

430
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 4>was dating this girl and she looked it up because I was having these migraines</v>

431
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.270
<v Speaker 4>and she said you'd be drinking a bunch of crystal light.</v>

432
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.490
<v Speaker 4>Cause I was at the time just shaking it up and making things,</v>

433
00:12:18.491 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

434
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.563
<v Speaker 4>you can</v>

435
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.090
<v Speaker 4>cut it out.</v>

436
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.060
<v Speaker 4>Migraines went away.</v>

437
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Didn't know what it was.</v>

438
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.480
<v Speaker 4>That's what she said.</v>

439
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 4>It might've,</v>

440
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean that might be psychosomatic,</v>

441
00:12:27.071 --> 00:12:29.860
<v Speaker 4>but there's all this stuff online so aspartame causes these things,</v>

442
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes not in everybody.</v>

443
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:31.961
<v Speaker 4>It didn't.</v>

444
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 4>Donald Rumsfeld,</v>

445
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:34.840
<v Speaker 4>wasn't he the guy who pushed aspartame through?</v>

446
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 4>I can say that where it's like not fully tested.</v>

447
00:12:37.811 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 4>That's the negatives.</v>

448
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 4>But then you'll get thinner.</v>

449
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Well when you think about it,</v>

450
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:41.680
<v Speaker 4>it matters.</v>

451
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 4>Many people drink diet cokes.</v>

452
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty God damn safe cause everybody should be dropping like flies.</v>

453
00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not good for you,</v>

454
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:48.670
<v Speaker 4>but Jesus Christ,</v>

455
00:12:48.671 --> 00:12:50.200
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people drinking diet coke.</v>

456
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:51.550
<v Speaker 4>Where's all the brain tumors?</v>

457
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:51.941
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

458
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:53.820
<v Speaker 4>I mean people like really exaggerated.</v>

459
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.260
<v Speaker 4>Certainly not good for your odds of you Kevin.</v>

463
00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:01.780
<v Speaker 4>you're definitely better off.</v>

464
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 4>But you know how many people are getting cancer from diet coke?</v>

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.453
<v Speaker 5>tennis court,</v>

588
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.413
<v Speaker 5>go see that on youtube.</v>

589
00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:55.470
<v Speaker 5>It's on youtube.</v>

590
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.393
<v Speaker 5>How fast are you throwing?</v>

591
00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:57.880
<v Speaker 5>That's probably now one.</v>

592
00:15:58.050 --> 00:15:59.430
<v Speaker 5>Only in the mid eighties maybe,</v>

593
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:00.960
<v Speaker 5>but it's pretty fast.</v>

594
00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:01.800
<v Speaker 5>It was at night.</v>

595
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.950
<v Speaker 5>It was on a tennis court.</v>

596
00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:04.100
<v Speaker 5>Ultimate sound.</v>

597
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.850
<v Speaker 5>What's the fastest you've ever thrown a baseball?</v>

598
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.550
<v Speaker 5>I got clocked at 91 college,</v>

599
00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:09.211
<v Speaker 5>Arizona State.</v>

600
00:16:09.211 --> 00:16:12.240
<v Speaker 5>I can pitch with passion and I was a good pitcher.</v>

601
00:16:12.241 --> 00:16:12.940
<v Speaker 5>I just like,</v>

602
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.860
<v Speaker 5>that's like pro speed,</v>

603
00:16:13.861 --> 00:16:14.130
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>

604
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:14.580
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

605
00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:14.841
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

606
00:16:14.841 --> 00:16:15.420
<v Speaker 5>it's close.</v>

607
00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:16.200
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

608
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.480
<v Speaker 5>What's like a top of the line?</v>

609
00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.030
<v Speaker 5>What's the fastest the guy can like what?</v>

610
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 5>Like Roger Clemens in his prime was probably fill him mid to upper nineties.</v>

611
00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.601
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

612
00:16:27.601 --> 00:16:27.811
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

613
00:16:27.811 --> 00:16:30.960
<v Speaker 5>But mostly I would say mid nineties for climate was got over a hundred.</v>

614
00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:31.940
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

615
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.160
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

616
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.530
<v Speaker 5>Nolan Ryan back in the day you got John,</v>

617
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.460
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

618
00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.700
<v Speaker 5>Verlander now going to tiger stones over a hundred consistently.</v>

619
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:40.410
<v Speaker 5>Strasse right.</v>

620
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.730
<v Speaker 5>With the nationals,</v>

621
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.430
<v Speaker 5>hundred miles an hour starting pitchers.</v>

622
00:16:44.431 --> 00:16:45.810
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of relievers you'd do it.</v>

623
00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.070
<v Speaker 5>How hard is it to,</v>

624
00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.291
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

625
00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:48.124
<v Speaker 5>that's like,</v>

626
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:49.023
<v Speaker 5>that's amazing.</v>

627
00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.741
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

628
00:16:49.741 --> 00:16:50.251
<v Speaker 5>you've got a year,</v>

629
00:16:50.251 --> 00:16:50.910
<v Speaker 5>they get hit it.</v>

630
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:54.070
<v Speaker 5>I mean Fuck Justin Verlander I said Jonathan,</v>

631
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:55.141
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>

632
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:55.800
<v Speaker 5>how much,</v>

633
00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:56.940
<v Speaker 5>how fast do you have to be?</v>

634
00:16:56.941 --> 00:16:58.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean like if Babe Ruth was alive today,</v>

635
00:16:58.981 --> 00:17:00.210
<v Speaker 5>would he be shitting his pants?</v>

636
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.920
<v Speaker 5>Would they be throwing heat right past him?</v>

637
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.221
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

638
00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.420
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people think that,</v>

639
00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:04.283
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

640
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.920
<v Speaker 5>the guy,</v>

641
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.870
<v Speaker 5>I think more guys go harder now.</v>

642
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:07.290
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

643
00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:08.730
<v Speaker 5>Then way back when,</v>

644
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.040
<v Speaker 5>way back then he probably would have adjusted.</v>

645
00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.090
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

646
00:17:12.090 --> 00:17:12.720
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

647
00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.680
<v Speaker 5>it's a timing thing.</v>

648
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:14.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

649
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.900
<v Speaker 5>But the guys do time at these hitters.</v>

650
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:16.860
<v Speaker 5>They figure it out.</v>

651
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:18.330
<v Speaker 5>They'll hit a hundred miles an hour.</v>

652
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.820
<v Speaker 5>What's the worst thing that ever happened in baseball when they started testing</v>

653
00:17:20.821 --> 00:17:21.654
<v Speaker 5>for steroids?</v>

654
00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:22.591
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

655
00:17:22.591 --> 00:17:27.120
<v Speaker 5>I'd like to see because when you're not doing steroids or HGH and ends careers,</v>

656
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:29.750
<v Speaker 5>I mean who didn't like watching Barry bonds had all those home runs,</v>

657
00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:32.900
<v Speaker 5>had two who didn't like watching Roger Clemens pitch it.</v>

658
00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.640
<v Speaker 5>42 Nolan Ryan pitched show.</v>

659
00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.060
<v Speaker 5>He's 46 he went on steroids.</v>

660
00:17:36.061 --> 00:17:40.260
<v Speaker 5>But it'd be great to see guys continue to play like after 40 you can take a</v>

661
00:17:40.261 --> 00:17:40.861
<v Speaker 5>supplement,</v>

662
00:17:40.861 --> 00:17:42.330
<v Speaker 5>you can take out an MMA.</v>

663
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.653
<v Speaker 5>You're allowed to.</v>

664
00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:44.680
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of guys.</v>

665
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.680
<v Speaker 5>Dan Henderson's on testosterone replacement.</v>

666
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.320
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

667
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 5>the rampage just admitted he was testosterone replacement.</v>

668
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

669
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.293
<v Speaker 3>I was at the door.</v>

670
00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.000
<v Speaker 4>What Norman today?</v>

671
00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.751
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

672
00:17:53.751 --> 00:17:54.590
<v Speaker 4>but for what</v>

673
00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.190
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

674
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:57.130
<v Speaker 5>this isn't the ice house.</v>

675
00:17:57.131 --> 00:17:58.030
<v Speaker 5>You got to get around the alley.</v>

676
00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.240
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>

677
00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.380
<v Speaker 4>it goes behind</v>

678
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.033
<v Speaker 4>the shoulder,</v>

679
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:04.550
<v Speaker 4>but wonderful interview.</v>

680
00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.393
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what just happened.</v>

681
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.920
<v Speaker 4>Did that guy look like a natural?</v>

682
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.361
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

683
00:18:10.361 --> 00:18:10.561
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

684
00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:13.150
<v Speaker 5>I didn't look like Don Johnson's Dad.</v>

685
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:14.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

686
00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:15.950
<v Speaker 5>so he's got a nice spirit.</v>

687
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:17.990
<v Speaker 5>I think they should have let the guys,</v>

688
00:18:17.991 --> 00:18:19.160
<v Speaker 5>when you over 40,</v>

689
00:18:19.161 --> 00:18:20.240
<v Speaker 5>you're allowed to take,</v>

690
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.620
<v Speaker 5>if they sponsored it,</v>

691
00:18:21.621 --> 00:18:23.390
<v Speaker 5>they look at it some kind of,</v>

692
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.370
<v Speaker 3>and did they treat it like these guys are stealing babies.</v>

693
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.641
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

694
00:18:26.641 --> 00:18:27.091
<v Speaker 3>they're making it,</v>

695
00:18:27.091 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 3>all they're doing is taking something and it makes them perform better and</v>

696
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.070
<v Speaker 3>things that make your body perform better.</v>

697
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't that just be researched more.</v>

698
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

699
00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:38.580
<v Speaker 3>it seems to me that as long as these people aren't dying and not getting cancer,</v>

700
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:39.330
<v Speaker 3>this isn't some,</v>

701
00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:40.740
<v Speaker 3>some crazy stuff that goes on.</v>

702
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.530
<v Speaker 3>They're going to reputable doctors and they're doing this release.</v>

703
00:18:43.531 --> 00:18:44.281
<v Speaker 3>Clemens was,</v>

704
00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:45.114
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know,</v>

705
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Barry bonds was involved in that bulk of thing.</v>

706
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:47.971
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

707
00:18:47.971 --> 00:18:48.804
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

708
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:49.121
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

709
00:18:49.121 --> 00:18:52.180
<v Speaker 5>I guess they say because it makes for an uneven playing field,</v>

710
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.890
<v Speaker 5>but as more research comes out,</v>

711
00:18:53.891 --> 00:18:55.390
<v Speaker 5>everybody hopefully would know like,</v>

712
00:18:55.391 --> 00:18:55.751
<v Speaker 5>you know what,</v>

713
00:18:55.751 --> 00:18:56.350
<v Speaker 5>HGH,</v>

714
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.190
<v Speaker 5>it's not bad for you.</v>

715
00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.210
<v Speaker 5>It's actually good for you.</v>

716
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:00.390
<v Speaker 5>I want to take it at like a vitamin almost.</v>

717
00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

718
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

719
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:01.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

720
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.400
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot of ignorance when it comes to it,</v>

721
00:19:03.401 --> 00:19:04.600
<v Speaker 3>but it's fascinating to me.</v>

722
00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:07.360
<v Speaker 3>They would spend so much time in front of Congress.</v>

723
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.463
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

724
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

725
00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:10.450
<v Speaker 3>they had this trial,</v>

726
00:19:10.451 --> 00:19:12.110
<v Speaker 3>the Barry bonds trial and yeah,</v>

727
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.230
<v Speaker 3>as far as um,</v>

728
00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:13.511
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

729
00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:14.350
<v Speaker 3>Roger Clemens too,</v>

730
00:19:14.351 --> 00:19:15.310
<v Speaker 3>I think it goes down to,</v>

731
00:19:15.311 --> 00:19:20.140
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a perjury trial because they caught them saying in the past under</v>

732
00:19:20.141 --> 00:19:21.760

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.420
<v Speaker 7>but gay guys are allowed to like shit out of their cars.</v>

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:52.490

909
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.510

<v Speaker 8>Well just like numbness but yet my good though,</v>

<v Speaker 8>have you ever had morphine?</v>

949
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.800
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

950
00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 8>You gotta have you gotta get more?</v>

951
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

952
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.090
<v Speaker 8>I know they gave it to me in like a drip when I was young.</v>

953
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:06.650
<v Speaker 8>I had my first knee surgery.</v>

954
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:07.570
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

955
00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.210
<v Speaker 8>and they also put you on like a perpetual motion machine that you know,</v>

956
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.053
<v Speaker 8>morphine drip.</v>

957
00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:11.970
<v Speaker 8>Oo.</v>

958
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

959
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 8>What's a perpetual motion?</v>

960
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:14.431
<v Speaker 8>You have one,</v>

961
00:25:14.431 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 8>you have certain types of knee surgery and certain doctors,</v>

962
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.120
<v Speaker 8>there's a bunch of different schools of thought,</v>

963
00:25:20.121 --> 00:25:22.850
<v Speaker 8>but some doctors on certain particular knee surgeries,</v>

964
00:25:22.851 --> 00:25:26.060
<v Speaker 8>like a ACL reconstructions right after they do it,</v>

965
00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:27.620
<v Speaker 8>they want blood flow to the knee.</v>

966
00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.041
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

967
00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:29.740
<v Speaker 8>They put you on a machine that's moving your,</v>

968
00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:32.920
<v Speaker 8>moving your leg in a very limited motion.</v>

969
00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.420
<v Speaker 8>It's not going to go any further.</v>

970
00:25:34.421 --> 00:25:35.380
<v Speaker 8>A second extend anymore.</v>

971
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:35.890
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

972
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:36.910
<v Speaker 8>So it does this,</v>

973
00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 8>just to kind of keep your thing from freezing up is that it becomes a real</v>

974
00:25:40.761 --> 00:25:41.320
<v Speaker 8>problem.</v>

975
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:41.630
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>

976
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.020
<v Speaker 8>yeah.</v>

977
00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:42.980
<v Speaker 8>So that's what I've got.</v>

978
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.080
<v Speaker 8>I don't remember it much.</v>

979
00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:45.923

982
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.070
<v Speaker 8>when Nyquil had coding?</v>

983
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.313

<v Speaker 8>I have lived such a sheltered life.</v>

1014
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.320
<v Speaker 8>Have you ever done that?</v>

1015

1018
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:42.650
<v Speaker 8>I remember one time I was sick and I got ahold of some of the last real nyquil.</v>

1019
00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.740
<v Speaker 8>They have the coding and I was fucked up.</v>
