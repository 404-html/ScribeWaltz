00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>How strong are these?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't have to write.</v>

2
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.800
<v Speaker 1>I definitely wouldn't have two of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a 240 milligrams of caffeine.</v>

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Now I can feel it rising inside of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That baby.</v>

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>See why you want to ruin star wars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.080

<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do that man.</v>

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I heard a lot of people are saying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

8
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:25.344
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

9
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.690
<v Speaker 1>they heard it was crap and that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't good.</v>

10
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>But everybody I know that saw it said it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was awesome.</v>

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You loved it.</v>

12
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

13
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>what are you thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

14
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>What did you think we are going to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>see?</v>

15
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.283
<v Speaker 1>It's called Star Wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the most obvious kind of </v>

16
00:00:41.551 --> 00:00:42.384
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why people have </v>

17
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:43.674
<v Speaker 1>expectations for star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the expectations I guess they're </v>

18
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>looking for or a plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're looking for.</v>

19
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

20
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I guess they're looking for some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like deep like meaning or something like</v>

21
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Quintin Tarantino or some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some kubrick ask thing.</v>

22
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>It's star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a space opera.</v>

23
00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:09.831
<v Speaker 1>It's like I go in there with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations,</v>

24
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>be happy for the colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it,</v>

25
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then after that,</v>

26
00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:15.264
<v Speaker 1>if there's something out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's things flying through space and </v>

27
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>lasers.</v>

28
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>It's a very confined genre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very confined and you know it's not</v>

29
00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:23.294
<v Speaker 2>going to step outside of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to be weird sexually not </v>

30
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 2>going to have some strange murder </v>
<v Speaker 2>tension because I'm going to be any like</v>

31
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.463
<v Speaker 2>any unrequited love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be just some normal </v>

32
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 2>space themes with Joseph Campbell's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hero's journey.</v>

33
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's mixing with a lot of mystical stuff</v>

34
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 2>that you can connect to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is beautiful.</v>

35
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.920
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had lucas talk about his friend Joseph</v>

36
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.753
<v Speaker 2>Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally wrote star wars based on </v>

37
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Campbell's steps of a hero's </v>
<v Speaker 2>journey.</v>

38
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were.</v>

39
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 2>There were good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

40
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:54.944
<v Speaker 2>The hero with a thousand faces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is classic book and then he did </v>

41
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 2>have you seen his interviews with Bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>Moyers?</v>

42
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Power of myth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was fantastic.</v>

43
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:03.884
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Joseph Campbell used to go up and </v>

44
00:02:07.071 --> 00:02:10.190
<v Speaker 2>give a lecture at Lucas ranch every year</v>
<v Speaker 2>on mythology.</v>

45
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Lucas ranch where George Lucas ranch up </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Morin or sonoma and so he would go up</v>

46
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:21.830
<v Speaker 2>and when they were working on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original star wars and give a lecture to</v>

47
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:24.590
<v Speaker 2>the crew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody about mythology every year and</v>

48
00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 2>then when Campbell died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend in mind,</v>

49
00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Stanley kripner filled in for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

50
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

51
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Stanley's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Till I just saw him a week ago.</v>

52
00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:36.104
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin happened to text me while I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking with doing the podcast with </v>

53
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:41.150
<v Speaker 2>Stanley or just finished and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

54
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.850

<v Speaker 2>He's really interesting.</v>

55
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

56
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 2>he's a comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's really into the spiritual stuff</v>

57
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:47.654
<v Speaker 2>and he just got back from seeing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with Ram das in Hawaii and </v>

58
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:52.790
<v Speaker 2>Stanley says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

59
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 2>does he know that Ron doss was a standup</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian for a time?</v>

60
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.133
<v Speaker 2>I feel like he got him mixed up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Timothy leary because I know timothy </v>

61
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 2>leary</v>

62
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>went on tour doing like some some kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing called stand up,</v>

63
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think rahm does did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know Timothy leary tried stand up.</v>

64
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said he saw him in the village and </v>

65
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>the club does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

66
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's probably on acid.</v>

67
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Richard Alpert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was probably thinking,</v>

68
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:20.411
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>

69
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Let me give it a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

70
00:03:21.911 --> 00:03:22.744
<v Speaker 1>he's a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great speaker and he is pretty </v>

71
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:24.531
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

72
00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:26.910
<v Speaker 1>You said he's like a very humorous guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to him.</v>

73
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>He's super funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.643
<v Speaker 1>Which is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed that seems to be a quality </v>

75
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and people who have a real spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice like funny.</v>

76
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:35.613
<v Speaker 1>They're always funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always have this real specific non </v>

77
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>bullshit style of humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to offend them.</v>

78
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.973
<v Speaker 1>That's quite often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I can tell if somebody's got </v>

79
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>a real practice is usually impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 1>offend.</v>

80
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>Like there isn't anything that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that's gonna make them upset,</v>

81
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:55.984
<v Speaker 1>but you know the alarm bells start going</v>
<v Speaker 1>off in my mind when you get around </v>

82
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>people who you say something and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

83
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I triggered the alarm system.</v>

84
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>I have offended this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really curious to me like,</v>

85
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>how are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you in tune with the universe?</v>

86
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.913
<v Speaker 1>And yet still something that a monkey </v>
<v Speaker 1>descendant says out of the end of his </v>

87
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.394
<v Speaker 1>feeding tube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it causes you to feel results in </v>

88
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>durable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're so tough.</v>

89
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>How you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you such a pussy?</v>

90
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.200
<v Speaker 1>It was a truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

91
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.880
<v Speaker 1>well not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like,</v>

92
00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like the opposite of tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

93
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean I agree like sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well until you know what's going on.</v>

94
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.323
<v Speaker 1>It's the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they've described it or I've </v>

95
00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:38.330
<v Speaker 1>heard it described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is super cool when they,</v>

96
00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.443
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever they were I'm das talks about </v>

97
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:42.250

<v Speaker 1>neem Karoli Baba,</v>

98
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.020
<v Speaker 1>is that there was nothing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no obstruction.</v>

99
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:47.854
<v Speaker 1>Like anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was just sort of going </v>

100
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>through this person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get on the phone with Bank of America,</v>

102
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.090
<v Speaker 1>they've frozen my card because I went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia and like I'm saving with rage.</v>

103
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.280
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't another fucking country.</v>

106
00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:12.224
<v Speaker 1>freeze up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people they get to the point </v>

107
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.960
<v Speaker 1>theoretically or that like convulsive </v>
<v Speaker 1>seizure,</v>

108
00:05:17.961 --> 00:05:19.040
<v Speaker 1>like freezing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

109
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.570
<v Speaker 3>doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>

110
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.463
<v Speaker 3>I can get that in spurts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get done in spurts from Yoga and </v>

111
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:25.184
<v Speaker 3>here's what I can prove it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A guy fucking nailed me on the highway </v>

112
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 3>while he wasn't paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the brakes,</v>

113
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:30.544
<v Speaker 3>skid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I watched him plow into my fucking car </v>

114
00:05:32.151 --> 00:05:33.490
<v Speaker 3>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my white Porsche,</v>

115
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.110
<v Speaker 3>the expensive one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a rare car too.</v>

116
00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:36.891
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

117
00:05:36.891 --> 00:05:37.724
<v Speaker 3>I hope he didn't total the car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got out and the first thing I said </v>

118
00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:41.000
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you okay?</v>

119
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.500
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>

120
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.930
<v Speaker 3>We're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I literally wasn't upset at all yet.</v>

121
00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.490
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't upset but I've been doing yoga </v>
<v Speaker 3>like four days a week and I was a little</v>

122
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:50.760
<v Speaker 3>high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

123
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 3>probably still from the afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was probably like,</v>

124
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.943
<v Speaker 3>at least under the influence of cannabis</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the point where I was like a little </v>

125
00:05:56.751 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 3>bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

126
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

127
00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 4>I can only get there for like bursts </v>
<v Speaker 4>when when you're busy with work and life</v>

128
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 4>and it can overwhelm and you get mad at </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone doing a shitty job,</v>

129
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 4>parking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like come on,</v>

130
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:10.410
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>head punk,</v>

131
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 4>your car stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

132
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 4>like you backing up again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

133
00:06:13.731 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 4>look at this retard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's get back up again.</v>

134
00:06:15.531 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then I'll be like,</v>

135
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 4>I'll catch myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

136
00:06:17.331 --> 00:06:22.331
<v Speaker 4>why not even talking to this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy's in a car 100 feet from me and</v>

137
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:22.810
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

138
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm openly mocking him out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:25.960
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

140
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.960
<v Speaker 2>eroding your insides as you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I heard Wim Hoff talking about this.</v>

141
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it was on your podcast and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about being under the ice in his</v>

142
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>retinas froze and he couldn't find the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hole to get out.</v>

143
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.200
<v Speaker 2>And whoever was he was talking with </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked him like,</v>

144
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

145
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:43.720
<v Speaker 2>what was the panic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what,</v>

146
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

147
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:46.131
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:46.964
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in those situations or like </v>
<v Speaker 2>when I got lost in a whiteout on Mount </v>

149
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.570
<v Speaker 2>Everest in my shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

150
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no stress because then it's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

151
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 2>it takes you back to yourself to who you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really are.</v>

152
00:06:59.511 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 2>And I know in my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my core,</v>

153
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:07.061
<v Speaker 2>I am like a competent and confident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

154
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:09.344
<v Speaker 2>so he was saying it's been demonstrated </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can generate more stress </v>

155
00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:13.364
<v Speaker 2>hormones laying in your bed and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about something stressful than </v>

156
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.200
<v Speaker 2>what actually happens when you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment of actual danger.</v>

157
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 2>You sort of shift into another gear when</v>
<v Speaker 2>that car hit you,</v>

158
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.480
<v Speaker 2>that changed your whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

159
00:07:26.481 --> 00:07:27.314
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now now you're framing it as am I going </v>

160
00:07:29.311 --> 00:07:30.144
<v Speaker 2>to survive this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I knew I was going to survive </v>

161
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:33.950
<v Speaker 2>because he wasn't going that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was just taking.</v>

162
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 2>My car's going to be told you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching him in the rear view mirror.</v>

163
00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was stopped.</v>

164
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.440
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

165
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.343
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guy almost hit me today on his </v>

166
00:07:40.831 --> 00:07:41.664
<v Speaker 4>phone with his phone literally on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>steering wheel as he's texting and </v>

167
00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:46.660
<v Speaker 4>driving and just went right into my </v>
<v Speaker 4>lane.</v>

168
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.530
<v Speaker 4>I think it's constant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are constantly doing it.</v>

169
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:51.690
<v Speaker 4>They're just not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if something happens,</v>

170
00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.530
<v Speaker 4>when the guy rear ended me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the lane was closed for some reason like</v>

171
00:07:55.531 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 4>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everybody had gotten to that,</v>

172
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.990
<v Speaker 4>that onramp on Hollywood and or the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>on one and highland exit and it was shut</v>

173
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:07.170
<v Speaker 4>down for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were all stopped at a big line and</v>

174
00:08:07.171 --> 00:08:08.004
<v Speaker 4>this dude just barely paid attention and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then all of a sudden shit and I could </v>

175
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.770
<v Speaker 4>see his face like gritting his teeth </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling fan.</v>

176
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching my rear view tensing up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my car stalls out,</v>

177
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.790
<v Speaker 4>goes flying into another lane</v>

178
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.720
<v Speaker 2>where you don't want to be on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>motorcycle.</v>

179
00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:23.643
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

180
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:08:24.821 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 2>That's so dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get hit like that on a motorcycle</v>

182
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:28.894
<v Speaker 2>who you might be paralyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be dead it easily and you </v>

183
00:08:31.241 --> 00:08:33.600
<v Speaker 2>can't get off and it's not your fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

184
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 2>And I rode a bike for seven and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and I always felt like I'm,</v>

185
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I've got everything under control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's that,</v>

186
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:43.900
<v Speaker 2>there's those tiles off if you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time to jump off and get the fuck out of</v>

187
00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:45.880
<v Speaker 2>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I never,</v>

188
00:08:45.881 --> 00:08:48.060
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't like a competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

189
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.910
<v Speaker 4>dad and you see a guy coming from behind</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

190
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.430
<v Speaker 4>Do you jump off?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You let it hit you?</v>

191
00:08:54.431 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck do do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't</v>

192
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.903
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're hyper aware of all the space </v>

193
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:01.410
<v Speaker 2>around you on a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm always.</v>

194
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 2>If I'm stopped and I know like on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>highway situation,</v>

195
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.633
<v Speaker 2>I'm always watching behind me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel you developed that vulnerable </v>

196
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:10.600
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scary man.</v>

197
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 2>Bikes back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember Bill Byrd</v>

198
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.490
<v Speaker 1>telling us what he has I guess at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ice House.</v>

199
00:09:15.491 --> 00:09:19.180
<v Speaker 1>He's like riding a motorcycle is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine sitting on the.</v>

200
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 2>If your car driving that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He looked down at the road buzzing by at</v>

201
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 2>70 miles an hour and it's like I could </v>
<v Speaker 2>reach out my toe and just grind it off,</v>

202
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.623
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

203
00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

204
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:33.294
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a metaphor for so many other </v>

205
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:35.700
<v Speaker 2>things in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

206
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.983
<v Speaker 2>Do you really want to be set?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have the illusion of </v>

207
00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:41.364
<v Speaker 2>separation or do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you actually safer being intimate </v>

208
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 2>with the danger of what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're hypervigilant because in a car</v>

209
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:51.144
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking with the radio because </v>

210
00:09:53.341 --> 00:09:54.174
<v Speaker 2>you've got the sense that I'm in a room </v>
<v Speaker 2>and everything's cool until he hit the </v>

211
00:09:57.121 --> 00:09:58.080
<v Speaker 2>tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.683
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely get to detach and as things </v>

213
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:02.784
<v Speaker 2>get more and more automated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be weirder and weirder as </v>

214
00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:08.000
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can tell your car things like,</v>

215
00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you've used that.</v>

216
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Siri function.</v>

217
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

218
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.040
<v Speaker 2>So you asked your car to text people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>text people,</v>

219
00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.920
<v Speaker 2>tell us to send less time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on your podcast.</v>

220
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.430
<v Speaker 2>You did this whole thing and I saw a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people tweeted,</v>

221
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:24.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up my phone off.</v>

222
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.300
<v Speaker 2>They're listed in the fuck in the car </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm like,</v>

223
00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 2>how hard is it for you to press the </v>
<v Speaker 2>button?</v>

224
00:10:28.981 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 2>All I have to do is press the button and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I say it,</v>

225
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.470
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

226
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say that do the Hey Siri thing.</v>

227
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 2>But my point being is they have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tesla's now that they're coming with,</v>

228
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 2>they have a new download that allows you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have your car automate itself.</v>

229
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 2>Like you set the directions and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigates drives.</v>

230
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it fucking drives itself.</v>

231
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.023
<v Speaker 2>So like then it's gonna get real weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>when we switched back and forth between </v>

232
00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:58.941
<v Speaker 2>that and then actual driving like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>space out factor of people.</v>

233
00:10:59.801 --> 00:11:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Like when they have to drive again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might not be used to it.</v>

234
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the space between automation and </v>

235
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.260
<v Speaker 1>like semi automation and full automation</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is going to be really dangerous.</v>

236
00:11:09.261 --> 00:11:12.020
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dream as you leave your house,</v>

237
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>your car looks like a little living </v>
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>

238
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 1>a little pod with a couch in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coffeemaker,</v>

239
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.793
<v Speaker 1>a TV and you just sit on the couch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the car where it take me to vegas </v>

240
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.740
<v Speaker 1>and it just takes you there and you just</v>
<v Speaker 1>relax on the sleep.</v>

241
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.813
<v Speaker 1>You can look out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interstates are just going to look </v>

242
00:11:30.561 --> 00:11:31.550
<v Speaker 1>like houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

243
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.400
<v Speaker 2>She miss you with your aviator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunglasses on the gloves hair.</v>

244
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.330
<v Speaker 2>You driving gloves about driving shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get crazy.</v>

245
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a little nervous driving shoes.</v>

246
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.640
<v Speaker 2>That's shifting the gears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you have like a,</v>

247
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:49.570
<v Speaker 2>an old Fiat or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

248
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Will you look like you're a poet or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something?</v>

249
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:52.143
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are people back scarf </v>

250
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 2>over your shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there were a carriage drivers.</v>

251
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of missing that last last.</v>

252
00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:08.180
<v Speaker 2>The horses back smell or the farts like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone always.</v>

253
00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 2>There's a nostalgia attached to </v>
<v Speaker 2>antiquated technologies,</v>

254
00:12:13.541 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

255
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.484
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to be sitting in my </v>

256
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 2>pleasure pod with vr goggles on is I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken to Florida.</v>

257
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.323
<v Speaker 2>We're off the sacred river flows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are missing the pleasure of the </v>

258
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:30.280
<v Speaker 2>wooden wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Losing traction on the muddy road.</v>

259
00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not aerodynamic box.</v>

260
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:37.460
<v Speaker 2>Being dragged by horses starts to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>sideways near the edge of the cliff.</v>

261
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 2>What an adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a great time to be alive,</v>

262
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.570
<v Speaker 2>but I don't even have to ride the horse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can ride in a box behind the horse.</v>

263
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.613
<v Speaker 2>Not our technology is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Progress being that box with fine silk </v>

264
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.653
<v Speaker 2>like seeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything would be made with pushup </v>

265
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 2>Bra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The core sets,</v>

266
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.940
<v Speaker 2>the core sets lots of ruffled skirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking trying to bang a chick,</v>

267
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 2>one of those skirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which disaster.</v>

268
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got to make a choice.</v>

269
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Either you don't see her vagina or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't see your face.</v>

270
00:13:08.561 --> 00:13:13.180
<v Speaker 2>It's one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't have it both ways.</v>

271
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.260
<v Speaker 2>If you push that thing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's gone.</v>

272
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know his citic Jews have sex through</v>

273
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.364
<v Speaker 2>a sheet with a gun in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend John Joke about it that the </v>

274
00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:35.160
<v Speaker 2>women used to look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the clothes line.</v>

275
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:40.161
<v Speaker 2>So you had the biggest hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jon Tobin.</v>

276
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:42.820
<v Speaker 2>The thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that stuff man.</v>

277
00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Like who's the for like someone had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the first person to be like,</v>

278
00:13:46.931 --> 00:13:49.670
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's put a big sheet over you and cut a</v>

279
00:13:49.671 --> 00:13:52.480
<v Speaker 2>hole right over your pussy so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see you anymore.</v>

280
00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't evolve,</v>

281
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.153
<v Speaker 2>didn't even touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not just a not see you that your </v>

282
00:13:57.641 --> 00:14:00.280
<v Speaker 2>bodies don't touch to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So someone invented that though,</v>

283
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:01.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a person who's like,</v>

284
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.523
<v Speaker 2>I've got an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's start putting the women in </v>

285
00:14:04.571 --> 00:14:08.020
<v Speaker 2>blankets and fucking a whole right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't evolve,</v>

286
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:09.690
<v Speaker 2>right Chris?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a per.</v>

287
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:14.140
<v Speaker 2>There's one person who's incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>

288
00:14:14.141 --> 00:14:16.530
<v Speaker 2>I guess evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

289
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:21.040
<v Speaker 2>it may have just been like a hankie over</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's face initially,</v>

290
00:14:21.041 --> 00:14:22.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it grew.</v>

291
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 2>You can never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may have started as a blindfold,</v>

292
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it implies the communication about it.</v>

293
00:14:27.431 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Like you have to tell your friends like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

294
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:29.944
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put a handkerchief over her face last </v>

295
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.423
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you guys should start doing that </v>

296
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:34.903
<v Speaker 2>with even crazier that it took off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like one guy doing it like </v>

297
00:14:38.651 --> 00:14:39.484
<v Speaker 2>Hasidic Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge population of people in </v>

298
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In New York City.</v>

299
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.960
<v Speaker 2>There's a very big community of acidic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews and they're all doing that with the</v>

300
00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:50.940
<v Speaker 2>blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they do.</v>

301
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.913
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the women all shaved their </v>

302
00:14:54.261 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 2>heads and were widows to shave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it as an x,</v>

303
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.130
<v Speaker 2>no makeup and no talking.</v>

304
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.560
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn team.</v>

305
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 2>They had to wear a wig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about it and the Arabs make them</v>

306
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:10.274
<v Speaker 2>cover their hair right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an expression of anti </v>

307
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:14.970
<v Speaker 2>eroticism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti pleasure,</v>

308
00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're only going to have kids.</v>

309
00:15:17.031 --> 00:15:20.840
<v Speaker 2>There's no pleasure involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to do as much as possible</v>

310
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.340
<v Speaker 2>to remove everything that is in purely </v>
<v Speaker 2>functional.</v>

311
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that you're talking about,</v>

312
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:27.194
<v Speaker 2>the Tesla thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is bizarre about that is in </v>

313
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:31.250
<v Speaker 2>the fine print,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it says it's in Beta.</v>

314
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.970
<v Speaker 2>You went to your car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self driving car that's in Beta.</v>

315
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:39.630
<v Speaker 2>It says that they're not responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>any accident.</v>

316
00:15:39.631 --> 00:15:44.060
<v Speaker 2>So you should always watch the road and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be prepared to step in if something goes</v>

317
00:15:44.061 --> 00:15:44.511
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

318
00:15:44.511 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 2>well thanks for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back in my computer making days.</v>

319
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:51.960
<v Speaker 2>I used to have friends that would get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the latest builds of software of um,</v>

320
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:53.660
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>operating systems rather.</v>

321
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:54.643
<v Speaker 2>And so they would run like Beta versions</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like new windows operating systems </v>

322
00:15:58.461 --> 00:16:02.540
<v Speaker 2>and the shit was always crashing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was kind of half of the fun half.</v>

323
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.610
<v Speaker 2>The Fun for those guys was like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

324
00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm using windows nt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Blah Blah Blah and this is the new shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really only for server.</v>

326
00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:14.030
<v Speaker 2>So I have to have a workaround with </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain drivers for video cards.</v>

327
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all this crazy shit they used to</v>

328
00:16:16.071 --> 00:16:16.904
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember though is like when you got </v>

329
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 2>windows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to get this giant pack of desks.</v>

330
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you'd get two of these tubes </v>
<v Speaker 2>filled with those things.</v>

331
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would start off with a floppy.</v>

332
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.113
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to start out with a floppy </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was like your install your foods </v>

333
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.790
<v Speaker 2>that worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The floppy was like,</v>

334
00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 2>you'd stick that in and then you'd have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stick cd roms and like,</v>

335
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:41.660
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

336
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.220
<v Speaker 2>My first exposure to computers was when </v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked in real estate in New York,</v>

337
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.830
<v Speaker 2>in the diamond district full of Hasidic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jews.</v>

338
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:50.830
<v Speaker 2>That's there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

339
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:51.873
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy had a computers the size of a </v>

340
00:16:53.691 --> 00:16:56.990
<v Speaker 2>refrigerator and one of my jobs was to </v>
<v Speaker 2>backup the discs every week.</v>

341
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:58.123
<v Speaker 2>And you'd pull out these drawers and put</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing down and turn it and pull it </v>

342
00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:03.290
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the disc was about that big.</v>

343
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:08.840
<v Speaker 2>You're showing your hands like an album </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot bigger than an album.</v>

344
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm large pizza,</v>

345
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:13.280
<v Speaker 2>a large pizza that Herman Biggs was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

346
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:13.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

347
00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I think it was megabytes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

348
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:19.590
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was 86 or so.</v>

349
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 2>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so funny.</v>

350
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Like the amount of storage space that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have now,</v>

351
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.750
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of nuts and then also like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

352
00:17:26.751 --> 00:17:27.584
<v Speaker 2>So much of it is in the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you'd noticed like on the new </v>

353
00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:35.051
<v Speaker 2>iphone software,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doesn't download all your songs.</v>

354
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.253
<v Speaker 2>It shows you all your songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you go to play them it streams </v>

355
00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:40.100
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

356
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't get that because I want the shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>on my phone.</v>

357
00:17:42.621 --> 00:17:46.100
<v Speaker 2>So if I'm not connected or I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to pay for the data,</v>

358
00:17:46.101 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 2>it's my fucking state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got 128 gigs on my phone,</v>

359
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>fill it with</v>

360
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.570
<v Speaker 3>music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't sit here and how to do it.</v>

361
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:52.663
<v Speaker 3>Well you set it so that it's available </v>
<v Speaker 3>offline and then you download all of </v>

362
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:57.390
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to download all of them.</v>

363
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.940
<v Speaker 3>It's super annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know hotel the other day.</v>

364
00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like now downloading 847 songs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

365
00:18:03.691 --> 00:18:04.860
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck,</v>

366
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:06.023
<v Speaker 3>but you know when you're in a place that</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have cell phone service and </v>

367
00:18:08.071 --> 00:18:10.620
<v Speaker 3>you'd go to your music list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to use it in the gym.</v>

368
00:18:10.621 --> 00:18:11.580
<v Speaker 3>There was no service.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

369
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fuckers,</v>

370
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:15.240
<v Speaker 3>it's not on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I had to figure it out.</v>

371
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.770
<v Speaker 3>It's complaints back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

372
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:23.810
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't your complaint in the carriage</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your fucking slippery right over the</v>

373
00:18:24.781 --> 00:18:25.614
<v Speaker 3>top of the mountain where you might wind</v>
<v Speaker 3>up eating all your friends because you </v>

374
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:28.853
<v Speaker 3>gets stuck up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy man that we are constantly </v>

375
00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.513
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by some cloud of invisible </v>
<v Speaker 3>data that consists of all information </v>

376
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.990
<v Speaker 3>that has ever been recorded.</v>

377
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.420
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear about that guy?</v>

378
00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:44.750
<v Speaker 3>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went to see.</v>

379
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:45.593
<v Speaker 3>He got shipwrecked at sea for like over </v>
<v Speaker 3>a year with another guy and he made it </v>

380
00:18:50.971 --> 00:18:51.804
<v Speaker 3>by like drinking rain water,</v>
<v Speaker 3>needing turtles and all kinds of crazy </v>

381
00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the nuttiest stories.</v>

382
00:18:56.161 --> 00:18:56.994
<v Speaker 3>They're kind of raft for a fucking year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his companions family is now suing </v>

383
00:19:02.281 --> 00:19:04.930
<v Speaker 3>him because they say that he hates them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

384
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.130
<v Speaker 3>He ate the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Mexican guy.</v>

385
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.530
<v Speaker 3>The Mexican fisherman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they Mexican,</v>

386
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.360
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I dunno if they're Mexican,</v>

387
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.373
<v Speaker 3>but just the thought behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim Probably stores just the thought </v>

388
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:18.960
<v Speaker 3>behind it and banks sued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's funny.</v>

389
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 3>It's cannibalism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's on a criminal complaint.</v>

390
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.273
<v Speaker 3>It's a civil suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is because I don't </v>

391
00:19:25.591 --> 00:19:26.424
<v Speaker 3>know if it's American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they have a different </v>

392
00:19:27.511 --> 00:19:29.250
<v Speaker 3>legal system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what it is,</v>

393
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:30.084
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even know if they're suing </v>
<v Speaker 3>or if they're trying to accuse him out </v>

394
00:19:32.991 --> 00:19:34.220
<v Speaker 3>and murdering him or something.</v>

395
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.480
<v Speaker 3>Eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the eating that bothered,</v>

396
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.010
<v Speaker 3>but if he's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat him.</v>

397
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said that's what I say.</v>

398
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.200
<v Speaker 3>Eat me if I die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what they say is that this guy shirt</v>

399
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:44.034
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was claiming that he kept the dude on </v>

400
00:19:46.081 --> 00:19:47.750
<v Speaker 3>the boat with them for company for six </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

401
00:19:47.751 --> 00:19:50.490
<v Speaker 3>Then throw them overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sued for $1,000,000</v>

402
00:19:50.491 --> 00:19:52.320
<v Speaker 3>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the thing,</v>

403
00:19:52.321 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 3>like how they prove that he ain't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you even accuse a guy?</v>

404
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.250
<v Speaker 3>I think he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He talked about it.</v>

405
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.830
<v Speaker 3>He talked to me yet because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Salvadorian,</v>

406
00:20:01.831 --> 00:20:02.664
<v Speaker 3>but they got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were in Mexico and they got swept </v>

407
00:20:04.591 --> 00:20:07.380
<v Speaker 3>out that I've read about this one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he talked about eating the guy.</v>

408
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's how the story says </v>

409
00:20:11.191 --> 00:20:15.930
<v Speaker 3>that he just threw the guy overboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you would want your family</v>

410
00:20:15.931 --> 00:20:18.600
<v Speaker 3>member to have like given his life for </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody.</v>

411
00:20:18.601 --> 00:20:22.050
<v Speaker 3>It kind of makes your family member or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hero or lots of cultures.</v>

412
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:25.110
<v Speaker 3>Ether did you know when someone dies </v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat them.</v>

413
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's an honor that is incredible.</v>

414
00:20:27.451 --> 00:20:29.310
<v Speaker 3>More than a year and see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

415
00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 3>see if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

416
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:30.773
<v Speaker 3>he admitted dreamy find it safe anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>he admitted he paid this guy to </v>

417
00:20:35.101 --> 00:20:38.190
<v Speaker 3>accompany him on a short fishing trip </v>
<v Speaker 3>off the coast of Mexico.</v>

418
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

419
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.560
<v Speaker 3>And he wrote a book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they want the money from the book.</v>

420
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:48.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might be right</v>

421
00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 5>or you might have ate that dude.</v>

422
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.380
<v Speaker 6>It looks like it looks like you need to </v>
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

423
00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to think it.</v>

424
00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:00.930
<v Speaker 6>I think most people think some cultures </v>
<v Speaker 6>were just cannibals for the hell of it,</v>

425
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.240
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they were just especially evil,</v>

426
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.980
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The aztecs or whatever.</v>

427
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 6>And then others just weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

428
00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.740
<v Speaker 6>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't make sense.</v>

429
00:21:08.741 --> 00:21:11.550
<v Speaker 6>So Europeans killed just as many people </v>
<v Speaker 6>as the aztecs did.</v>

430
00:21:11.551 --> 00:21:14.070
<v Speaker 6>They were just as ruthless.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're burning them at the stake,</v>

431
00:21:14.071 --> 00:21:15.210
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they even cook them,</v>

432
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.280
<v Speaker 6>but they didn't need him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

433
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.420
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So then I read this guy,</v>

434
00:21:18.421 --> 00:21:19.254
<v Speaker 6>Marvin Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this anthropologist who wrote a book </v>

435
00:21:21.061 --> 00:21:21.894
<v Speaker 6>called Cannibals and kings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He went back and looked at societies </v>

436
00:21:24.631 --> 00:21:26.520
<v Speaker 6>that were cannibalistic and those that </v>
<v Speaker 6>weren't,</v>

437
00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.730
<v Speaker 6>especially in the South Pacific because </v>
<v Speaker 6>some islands worse.</v>

438
00:21:29.731 --> 00:21:32.310
<v Speaker 6>I'm islands weren't whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And in Latin America.</v>

439
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.490
<v Speaker 6>And what he determined was that the </v>
<v Speaker 6>societies that were cannibalistic had,</v>

440
00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.410
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a lack of protein,</v>

441
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.710
<v Speaker 6>there were no animals that could be </v>
<v Speaker 6>domesticated.</v>

442
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.470
<v Speaker 6>And so when they killed people in </v>
<v Speaker 6>battle,</v>

443
00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:49.740
<v Speaker 6>they ate them because they were protein </v>
<v Speaker 6>hungry or starved.</v>

444
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.680
<v Speaker 6>And.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But Europeans had plenty of domesticated</v>

445
00:21:52.681 --> 00:21:53.514
<v Speaker 6>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they didn't need the protein because </v>

446
00:21:55.771 --> 00:21:57.630
<v Speaker 6>they had the goats and the pigs and </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

447
00:21:57.631 --> 00:21:58.464
<v Speaker 6>But if you think about Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing that they could </v>

448
00:22:00.211 --> 00:22:01.044
<v Speaker 6>domesticate except turkeys or dogs or </v>
<v Speaker 6>animals that eat the same food as </v>

449
00:22:05.071 --> 00:22:05.904
<v Speaker 6>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you need to domesticate an animal </v>

450
00:22:07.111 --> 00:22:09.450
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't eat what humans eat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's not competing.</v>

451
00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:12.570
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there were not in in North America.</v>

452
00:22:12.571 --> 00:22:13.620
<v Speaker 6>So that's why they were cannibals.</v>

453
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.990
<v Speaker 5>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

454
00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:17.340
<v Speaker 5>That's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It.</v>

455
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.213
<v Speaker 5>It's also important to note that I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the key tenants of Catholicism </v>

456
00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.270
<v Speaker 5>involves the kind of metaphysical </v>
<v Speaker 5>cannibalism,</v>

457
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 5>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

458
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:27.230
<v Speaker 5>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the communion,</v>

459
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.083
<v Speaker 5>the body of current body of Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they call that conversion of the </v>

460
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.730
<v Speaker 5>wafer into the flesh of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have a name.</v>

461
00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:38.730
<v Speaker 5>They think that when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when the priest is doing the ritual,</v>

462
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.540
<v Speaker 5>it's turning it into the flesh of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The trends.</v>

463
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:43.403
<v Speaker 5>Transubstantiation is the name for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's where you're shifting the </v>

464
00:22:47.101 --> 00:22:50.640
<v Speaker 5>wafer into the flesh of a god that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're eating.</v>

465
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:52.170
<v Speaker 5>But that's totally real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

466
00:22:52.171 --> 00:22:53.260
<v Speaker 5>that's totally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>totally real.</v>

467
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.640
<v Speaker 5>You can taste it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they get the right stuff.</v>

468
00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.613
<v Speaker 5>It's kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Many of them do think that that it is </v>

469
00:22:59.281 --> 00:23:00.170
<v Speaker 5>real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

470
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.640
<v Speaker 5>it's Godflesh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is actually a really old,</v>

471
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.310
<v Speaker 5>that's a very old tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is you eat,</v>

472
00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.173
<v Speaker 5>you eat a god,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you eat the sacrifice God to get its </v>

473
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.303
<v Speaker 5>energy or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What high deval originated with </v>

474
00:23:11.311 --> 00:23:12.490
<v Speaker 5>entheogens?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no,</v>

475
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.620
<v Speaker 5>no doubt that at all.</v>

476
00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:14.623
<v Speaker 6>Immediately what I thought of is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>Amanita muscarinic where the </v>

477
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.380
<v Speaker 6>psychoactive component stays active </v>
<v Speaker 6>after it's metabolized.</v>

478
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.100
<v Speaker 6>So the pis of the Shaman who's eating </v>
<v Speaker 6>almond eaters,</v>

479
00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.450
<v Speaker 6>Scalia will get you high as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

480
00:23:26.451 --> 00:23:27.950
<v Speaker 6>I just saw they fed them piss</v>

481
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.873
<v Speaker 5>at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Apparently Amany to Ms Dot Mascara is </v>

482
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:31.640
<v Speaker 5>very hard to get.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

483
00:23:31.641 --> 00:23:33.650
<v Speaker 5>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never gotten hired off of it.</v>

484
00:23:33.651 --> 00:23:35.180
<v Speaker 5>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we tried it once,</v>

485
00:23:35.181 --> 00:23:36.014
<v Speaker 5>it didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then we tried siliciden mushrooms </v>

486
00:23:38.841 --> 00:23:43.841
<v Speaker 5>with it and we had a fucking insane </v>
<v Speaker 5>journey so they might've worked together</v>

487
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:47.910
<v Speaker 5>and sort of sort of synergistic way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But um,</v>

488
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.183
<v Speaker 5>apparently by itself it's really hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they think that it might be like a </v>

489
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:52.304
<v Speaker 5>geographical variant like and then also </v>
<v Speaker 5>like seasonally and then genetically </v>

490
00:23:56.511 --> 00:23:57.344
<v Speaker 5>like you have to get the right stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the right stuff might not even exist in </v>

491
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.520
<v Speaker 5>most places anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

492
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.660
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't it?</v>

493
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:03.494
<v Speaker 5>All that follow the last pharmacology </v>
<v Speaker 5>they staff they will never even know </v>

494
00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:10.340
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like a Soma Soma.</v>

495
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.540
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is it like?</v>

496
00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:14.450
<v Speaker 5>What is this stuff you hear about this </v>
<v Speaker 5>all the time?</v>

497
00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:19.310
<v Speaker 5>All of these old technologies that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>just gone in the illusion mysteries.</v>

498
00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.680
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize this until recently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The Shamsi Lazy Lazy days or however you</v>

499
00:24:24.681 --> 00:24:27.530
<v Speaker 5>pronounce it in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the illusion.</v>

500
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:28.603
<v Speaker 5>Mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so it translates is illusion and </v>

501
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:32.750
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms shops,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

502
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:36.530
<v Speaker 5>Jumping Melanie's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's unquestionably without a doubt.</v>

503
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:38.600
<v Speaker 5>There were people that lived a long time</v>
<v Speaker 5>ago,</v>

504
00:24:38.601 --> 00:24:43.280
<v Speaker 5>the discovered psychedelic plants they </v>
<v Speaker 5>had to have and all.</v>

505
00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:44.114
<v Speaker 5>You have to just consider.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean this is the most rational way to </v>

506
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:49.460
<v Speaker 5>look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you lived at that time and you had no</v>

507
00:24:49.461 --> 00:24:51.560
<v Speaker 5>science,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you had some,</v>

508
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.980
<v Speaker 5>some myths and fables and some rules to </v>
<v Speaker 5>live by and you found those things,</v>

509
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:00.650
<v Speaker 5>you would think that you had found God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would definitely think if you,</v>

510
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.900
<v Speaker 5>if you just ate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have a scale.</v>

511
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.913
<v Speaker 5>You're just eating these mushrooms that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you find and you eat 10 grams of them </v>

512
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:09.110
<v Speaker 5>could lord,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're going to meet God.</v>

513
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:11.540
<v Speaker 5>You literally will be transported to </v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

514
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:12.583
<v Speaker 5>I never let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People will listen to this kind of shit </v>

515
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:15.170
<v Speaker 5>and they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh man,</v>

516
00:25:15.171 --> 00:25:16.360
<v Speaker 5>that's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

517
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.650
<v Speaker 5>you're just tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just hallucinating.</v>

518
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:21.410
<v Speaker 5>You got to take this into consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I've said it before,</v>

519
00:25:21.411 --> 00:25:24.800
<v Speaker 5>but it is important to repeat when you </v>
<v Speaker 5>haven't experienced.</v>

520
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.663
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't matter if that experience is </v>
<v Speaker 5>like you could put a scale or hit it </v>

521
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:31.250
<v Speaker 5>with a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a real experience.</v>

522
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:32.443
<v Speaker 5>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though you're no one's saying that </v>

523
00:25:35.691 --> 00:25:38.510
<v Speaker 5>you're meeting God when you do </v>
<v Speaker 5>mushrooms,</v>

524
00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 5>but what I am saying is it's the same </v>
<v Speaker 5>thing as meeting God.</v>

525
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.580
<v Speaker 5>Like the experience is so profound that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

526
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.770
<v Speaker 5>It would be like doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be like having.</v>

527
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.750
<v Speaker 5>When you do DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 5>perfect example,</v>

528
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:55.430
<v Speaker 5>it is like meeting the highest power </v>
<v Speaker 5>around you.</v>

529
00:25:55.431 --> 00:26:00.110
<v Speaker 5>It's like meeting a god.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like eating a sea of gods.</v>

530
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.730
<v Speaker 5>It feels like there's a place where </v>
<v Speaker 5>things can be both true and untrue.</v>

531
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:05.563
<v Speaker 5>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and and what you're talking about is </v>

532
00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 5>that overlap for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's where,</v>

533
00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like placebo effect.</v>

534
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.201
<v Speaker 5>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

535
00:26:12.201 --> 00:26:13.420
<v Speaker 5>it's just a sugar pill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

536
00:26:13.421 --> 00:26:15.980
<v Speaker 5>it's just a sugar pill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it has demonstrable,</v>

537
00:26:15.981 --> 00:26:18.380
<v Speaker 5>measurable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>repeatable effects on people.</v>

538
00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.290
<v Speaker 5>Hypnosis is another one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like wow,</v>

539
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.180
<v Speaker 5>the fuck does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Nobody's explained this and,</v>

540
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:27.230
<v Speaker 5>and I think when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're talking about seeing God,</v>

541
00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:28.064
<v Speaker 5>that is ultimately a subjective </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience that happened or didn't and </v>

542
00:26:32.561 --> 00:26:33.890
<v Speaker 5>if it did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it did.</v>

543
00:26:33.891 --> 00:26:37.160
<v Speaker 5>And there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no one from outside who can say,</v>

544
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.930
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just bullshit or that you know,</v>

545
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:44.020
<v Speaker 5>some sort of Richard Dawkins denial of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the sacred because you experienced</v>

546
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.530
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I'm sort of sympathetic.</v>

547
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:47.364
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I trash religion as much as the next </v>

548
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:49.884
<v Speaker 6>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm sympathetic for the experience </v>

549
00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 6>of someone who says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

550
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 6>I go there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have these rituals,</v>

551
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:56.184
<v Speaker 6>I smell that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was raised in this tradition and I am </v>

552
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:02.520
<v Speaker 6>transported to another world that makes </v>
<v Speaker 6>my life better.</v>

553
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.500
<v Speaker 6>I can't say that's not real despite the </v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit of the Bible or whatever.</v>

554
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

555
00:27:08.721 --> 00:27:09.491
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

556
00:27:09.491 --> 00:27:10.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is problematic.</v>

557
00:27:10.761 --> 00:27:12.860
<v Speaker 4>Is the label,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like even how I said it,</v>

558
00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.060
<v Speaker 4>like you'll meet God like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just that word is so loaded.</v>

559
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.550
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

560
00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:18.383
<v Speaker 4>that's a big part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big part of the problem with just the </v>

561
00:27:21.141 --> 00:27:21.974
<v Speaker 4>idea of religious religious ideas like </v>
<v Speaker 4>forget about the words that you're </v>

562
00:27:27.111 --> 00:27:27.944
<v Speaker 4>using,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you're using the word prayer or </v>

563
00:27:30.021 --> 00:27:34.580
<v Speaker 4>scripture or whatever the name you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>for your deity.</v>

564
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:39.590
<v Speaker 4>Those are just noise is you're making </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they correspond to like whatever the</v>

565
00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:44.591
<v Speaker 4>cultural context is of the Hindu God or </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Christian God,</v>

566
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:50.680
<v Speaker 4>but if you just think of the feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanting to be a good Christian,</v>

567
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.520
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The feeling of wanting to please God.</v>

568
00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Not by billowing up abortion clinics or </v>
<v Speaker 4>any.</v>

569
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:59.663
<v Speaker 4>There's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>None of the wacky aspects of it that we </v>

570
00:28:02.001 --> 00:28:03.020
<v Speaker 4>sort of connect to it.</v>

571
00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:07.640
<v Speaker 4>We think about like radical fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 4>religion on any side of the fence,</v>

572
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.533
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with the feeling that you're </v>

573
00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:11.240
<v Speaker 4>getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're feeling.</v>

574
00:28:11.241 --> 00:28:15.110
<v Speaker 4>If you're all together in church and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>really are praising his name,</v>

575
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:16.153
<v Speaker 4>you really are praising the idea of this</v>
<v Speaker 4>loving God that wants fellowship and </v>

576
00:28:20.451 --> 00:28:21.284
<v Speaker 4>wants camaraderie and brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like whatever that feeling is and </v>

577
00:28:24.351 --> 00:28:26.780
<v Speaker 4>whatever that thought is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take out all the words,</v>

578
00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:32.020
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>praise Jesus and Buddha and Muhammad and</v>

579
00:28:32.541 --> 00:28:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Allah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and take out all those words and what is</v>

580
00:28:35.391 --> 00:28:40.250
<v Speaker 4>the feeling like that feeling is search </v>
<v Speaker 4>for this positive,</v>

581
00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.623
<v Speaker 4>this positive source,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this thing that ultimately we can </v>

582
00:28:45.201 --> 00:28:46.034
<v Speaker 4>all eventually reach if we put aside all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of our ridiculous monkey behavior and </v>

583
00:28:50.241 --> 00:28:55.241
<v Speaker 4>greed and jealousy and anger and lust </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just get to us at our very best,</v>

584
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:57.213
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's almost like it's like a guide </v>

585
00:28:58.670 --> 00:28:59.503
<v Speaker 4>to get you there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we get tripped up on the words that </v>

586
00:29:01.761 --> 00:29:02.594
<v Speaker 4>are attached to the guide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the word God or the word Muhammad </v>

587
00:29:05.571 --> 00:29:06.404
<v Speaker 4>or the morgue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Allah or Krishna Krishna go down the </v>

588
00:29:10.281 --> 00:29:10.680
<v Speaker 4>line</v>

589
00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:15.680
<v Speaker 6>and the fucking parasites that latch on </v>
<v Speaker 6>to this and start selling shit.</v>

590
00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>making a structure around the rules.</v>

591
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.903
<v Speaker 6>Controlling people with Duncan started </v>
<v Speaker 6>off talking about how you can recognize </v>

592
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:28.440
<v Speaker 6>someone not just as a spiritually </v>
<v Speaker 6>enlightened person,</v>

593
00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:30.240
<v Speaker 6>but as a just a person you want to hang </v>
<v Speaker 6>out with.</v>

594
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 6>If they are really hard to offend,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if they have a good sense of humor,</v>

595
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.780
<v Speaker 6>if they don't have a sense of humor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's something wrong,</v>

596
00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:37.683
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and but you think about the Old </v>

597
00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:40.134
<v Speaker 6>Testament God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's the most easily offended </v>

598
00:29:42.161 --> 00:29:44.620
<v Speaker 6>motherfucker imaginable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

599
00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 6>like the book of job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you ever read the book of job,</v>

600
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.393
<v Speaker 6>it's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like job is this great guy does </v>

601
00:29:51.131 --> 00:29:51.964
<v Speaker 6>everything he's supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything's cool and the devil and God </v>

602
00:29:55.151 --> 00:29:58.450
<v Speaker 6>are hanging out one day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the devil's like that.</v>

603
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.520
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the devil says like,</v>

604
00:30:00.521 --> 00:30:02.170
<v Speaker 6>people don't really like you so much,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

605
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:03.490
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you think everybody loves you.</v>

606
00:30:03.491 --> 00:30:04.930
<v Speaker 6>And God's like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course people love me.</v>

607
00:30:04.931 --> 00:30:06.220
<v Speaker 6>Look at job.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's perfect.</v>

608
00:30:06.221 --> 00:30:08.160
<v Speaker 6>He does everything I tell him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the devil is like,</v>

609
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:10.360
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he only does what you tell him cause</v>

610
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:11.194
<v Speaker 6>you've been good to him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck with them a little bit and you'll </v>

611
00:30:12.971 --> 00:30:13.804
<v Speaker 6>see what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So God being the fucked up asshole that </v>

612
00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 6>he is apparently killed job's wife and </v>
<v Speaker 6>kids.</v>

613
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:22.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a,</v>

614
00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not meant to be taken literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

615
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a literal,</v>

616
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.290
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a story of the fact that,</v>

617
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:28.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

618
00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:29.770
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Duncan,</v>

619
00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:34.150
<v Speaker 6>of course it's to be taken literally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You question what kind of truck driver,</v>

620
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:35.003
<v Speaker 6>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is how cocky Duncan is dark and </v>

621
00:30:37.111 --> 00:30:38.070
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

622
00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:39.003
<v Speaker 6>I think what Jesus really taught wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>so good with his words back and since </v>

623
00:30:46.061 --> 00:30:49.750
<v Speaker 6>I've gone to college in North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's got a phd.</v>

624
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.780
<v Speaker 6>I had been talking to God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>God gave me a phd,</v>

625
00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:56.920
<v Speaker 6>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that you run into trouble if you</v>

626
00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 6>start looking at mythology and like is </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

627
00:30:59.831 --> 00:31:02.020
<v Speaker 6>That's really what it means.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get to actually do it,</v>

628
00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:05.080
<v Speaker 6>but look at the god that's being </v>
<v Speaker 6>depicted.</v>

629
00:31:05.081 --> 00:31:07.150
<v Speaker 6>There were,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was whatever the story is,</v>

630
00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 6>he's easily,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's jealous,</v>

631
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.050
<v Speaker 6>he's capricious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's cruel,</v>

632
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.650
<v Speaker 6>he's a fucking alcoholic father.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's.</v>

633
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.330
<v Speaker 6>So if you look at it,</v>

634
00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.580
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right now at this moment,</v>

635
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.470
<v Speaker 1>mothers are dying of cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are getting exploded by bombs.</v>

636
00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.850
<v Speaker 1>All of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dogs are attacking fucking old people in</v>

637
00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:27.900
<v Speaker 1>the farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

638
00:31:27.901 --> 00:31:28.734
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the story of job has always </v>

639
00:31:30.931 --> 00:31:35.880
<v Speaker 1>struck me more as a kind of like a story</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how look man,</v>

640
00:31:35.881 --> 00:31:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you can't understand the infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I step on an ant,</v>

641
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.060
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like,</v>

642
00:31:42.061 --> 00:31:42.894
<v Speaker 1>well I stepped on an ant today to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever that aunt tiny little </v>

643
00:31:46.561 --> 00:31:50.460
<v Speaker 1>subjective universe happens to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've completely obliterated it.</v>

644
00:31:50.461 --> 00:31:51.294
<v Speaker 1>I wiped it out that and could never </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly understand the internet action </v>

645
00:31:54.661 --> 00:31:57.180
<v Speaker 1>that just happened there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was a real interaction.</v>

646
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.490
<v Speaker 1>So it seems like the story of job is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more like,</v>

647
00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:00.653
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you universe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This incredible thing that I'm </v>

648
00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:04.374
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by that seems to vary </v>
<v Speaker 1>capriciously at random times just </v>

649
00:32:08.521 --> 00:32:11.970
<v Speaker 1>destroy people and lives and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit man.</v>

650
00:32:11.970 --> 00:32:15.970
<v Speaker 1>I just heard about this family driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>under an underpass and that like a bird,</v>

651
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.540
<v Speaker 1>like a concrete block fell out of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>truck,</v>

652
00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.690
<v Speaker 1>landed on the Goddamn Range Rover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

653
00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Entire family zapped out of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

654
00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:27.030
<v Speaker 1>And to me job was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the stats,</v>

655
00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:31.470
<v Speaker 1>what the story is like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can someone be a servant of love?</v>

656
00:32:31.471 --> 00:32:32.304
<v Speaker 1>Like what you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can someone connect to this desire </v>

657
00:32:35.731 --> 00:32:36.564
<v Speaker 1>to like give love and happiness and joy </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the universe when it any second </v>

658
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:46.450
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed for any human being there </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be in there will be a tragedy,</v>

659
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:50.210
<v Speaker 1>more devastating than anything you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever imagine because that's just the way</v>

660
00:32:50.211 --> 00:32:52.340
<v Speaker 1>the world works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to die.</v>

661
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.181
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

662
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

663
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife,</v>

664
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.930
<v Speaker 1>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your friends.</v>

665
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.793
<v Speaker 1>This is the reality we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how in that kind of swirling vortex </v>

666
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:02.864
<v Speaker 1>of chaos and violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you find a place where regardless of </v>

667
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:06.494
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will still be committed as much as </v>

668
00:33:08.751 --> 00:33:09.990
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

669
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.790
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

670
00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.600
<v Speaker 1>to do that thing you did on the road </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the fucking car hit here instead of</v>

671
00:33:14.601 --> 00:33:17.460
<v Speaker 1>getting out and fucking pummeling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy because you're agenda,</v>

672
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.530
<v Speaker 1>adrenaline's flowing.</v>

673
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:19.011
<v Speaker 1>You ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

674
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:20.810
<v Speaker 1>are you all right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's wild.</v>

675
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you it might seem like not that big a</v>

676
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:24.254
<v Speaker 1>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if everyone on planet earth started </v>

677
00:33:25.671 --> 00:33:27.110
<v Speaker 1>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

678
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.400
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a whole new.</v>

679
00:33:28.401 --> 00:33:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

680
00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.420
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

681
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.310
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I agree with what you're saying,</v>

682
00:33:32.311 --> 00:33:37.311
<v Speaker 6>but I think there's an underlying is s </v>
<v Speaker 6>assertion of the cruelty of the universe</v>

683
00:33:38.431 --> 00:33:41.340
<v Speaker 6>that I think is distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

684
00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:42.870
<v Speaker 6>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

685
00:33:42.871 --> 00:33:43.704
<v Speaker 6>I was watching this nature program a </v>
<v Speaker 6>couple of weeks ago and there was a </v>

686
00:33:46.111 --> 00:33:46.944
<v Speaker 6>seal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I may have even talked with you about </v>

687
00:33:48.181 --> 00:33:50.970
<v Speaker 6>this last time when it was on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there was like a seal playing in the</v>

688
00:33:50.971 --> 00:33:53.790
<v Speaker 6>waves and then you hear the like do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

689
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:54.610
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>do,</v>

690
00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:58.980
<v Speaker 6>do and you see the shadow coming up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a great white and it hits the seal.</v>

691
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.230
<v Speaker 6>And then they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the guy,</v>

692
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:05.190
<v Speaker 6>the narrator actually says we slow this </v>
<v Speaker 6>down to a one 40th of normal speed,</v>

693
00:34:05.191 --> 00:34:07.890
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you see the teeth of the and the,</v>

694
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:11.520
<v Speaker 6>and the seals flopping around and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's blood everywhere.</v>

695
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.920
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and in the meanwhile the narrator saying</v>

696
00:34:13.921 --> 00:34:16.350
<v Speaker 6>the struggle for survival isn't ever </v>
<v Speaker 6>over.</v>

697
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.560
<v Speaker 6>And so I'm watching that and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>thinking,</v>

698
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.620
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but seal seemed Kinda happy to me.</v>

699
00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:23.483
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like how come they're not more stressed </v>

700
00:34:24.661 --> 00:34:25.494
<v Speaker 6>out?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because all the seals I've seen relying </v>

701
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.960
<v Speaker 6>on rocks and chilling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>chilling,</v>

702
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:31.770
<v Speaker 6>and bargain and having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I looked up.</v>

703
00:34:31.771 --> 00:34:34.890
<v Speaker 6>This seal is a harbor seal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they lived to be about 30.</v>

704
00:34:34.891 --> 00:34:37.350
<v Speaker 6>So let's say this one's in its prime.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's 25.</v>

705
00:34:37.351 --> 00:34:39.540
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's whole fucking life.</v>

706
00:34:39.541 --> 00:34:42.030
<v Speaker 6>It's been lying on warm rocks and eaten </v>
<v Speaker 6>fresh fish.</v>

707
00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:46.410
<v Speaker 6>And then in half a second it's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

708
00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.800
<v Speaker 6>And we're looking at that as evidence of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the cruelty of nature.</v>

709
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.590
<v Speaker 6>That what's the ratio there?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

710
00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:54.730
<v Speaker 6>what's the ratio of good days to bad </v>
<v Speaker 6>days?</v>

711
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:57.120
<v Speaker 6>It seems like it's pretty fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>True.</v>

712
00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:02.510
<v Speaker 6>And I read this amazing account of being</v>
<v Speaker 6>pounced on by Elian by,</v>

713
00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.170
<v Speaker 6>I think it was who searched for </v>
<v Speaker 6>Livingston in,</v>

714
00:35:07.171 --> 00:35:08.930
<v Speaker 6>in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember livings,</v>

715
00:35:08.931 --> 00:35:10.440
<v Speaker 6>Dr Livingston,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I presume.</v>

716
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.640
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that guy,</v>

717
00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.193
<v Speaker 6>he got pants on by a lion and he talks </v>
<v Speaker 6>about how he didn't describe it this </v>

718
00:35:16.261 --> 00:35:17.094
<v Speaker 6>way,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the endorphins that are released </v>

719
00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.570
<v Speaker 6>when you're dying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

720
00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.180
<v Speaker 6>Especially in prey animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he was completely detached,</v>

721
00:35:24.181 --> 00:35:27.780
<v Speaker 6>completely relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Watching this lion tossing him around.</v>

722
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.003
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they think there's an evolutionary </v>

723
00:35:29.551 --> 00:35:30.384
<v Speaker 6>advantage to both species,</v>
<v Speaker 6>both the Predator and the prey in them </v>

724
00:35:34.201 --> 00:35:36.480
<v Speaker 6>having this endorphin release when they </v>
<v Speaker 6>get got,</v>

725
00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.640
<v Speaker 6>because when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when lions</v>

726
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:42.420
<v Speaker 1>attack like antelopes or with big cats </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch deer,</v>

727
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:46.110
<v Speaker 1>the deer kind of given man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get Jack,</v>

728
00:35:46.111 --> 00:35:47.220
<v Speaker 1>they nexia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't.</v>

729
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 1>They kind of like fight a little and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they kind of give in,</v>

730
00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 1>but like bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those kind of animals,</v>

731
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:57.160
<v Speaker 1>they don't really give in like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't like if a,</v>

732
00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:58.003
<v Speaker 1>if a cat and a mountain lion or or or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain line rather than a bear go at </v>

733
00:36:01.681 --> 00:36:04.550
<v Speaker 1>it like the bear isn't just going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give in to the mountain lion.</v>

734
00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:06.900
<v Speaker 1>As the mountain lion bites the bear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's neck,</v>

735
00:36:06.901 --> 00:36:07.734
<v Speaker 1>the bear is going to try to turn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bite them back and they're going to </v>

736
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.313
<v Speaker 1>tooth and claw it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to give wonder if he </v>

737
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:14.760
<v Speaker 1>would give into a dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whew.</v>

738
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:15.623
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something where the power is </v>

739
00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.960
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming and you feel it.</v>

740
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Like there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ain't getting out of this.</v>

741
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.560
<v Speaker 1>If that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What triggers the release?</v>

742
00:36:22.561 --> 00:36:23.394
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing that you're talking about </v>

743
00:36:24.781 --> 00:36:29.781
<v Speaker 1>right there is the secret of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that fucking release because if</v>

744
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:31.530
<v Speaker 1>you really look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

745
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:37.250
<v Speaker 1>we are in the mouth of a super predator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the entire universe and it's slowly</v>

746
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:42.921
<v Speaker 1>killing us right now that it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

747
00:36:44.131 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does sound like dire,</v>

748
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:46.733
<v Speaker 1>but on one level it sounds dire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the idea is like you have to </v>

749
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.910
<v Speaker 1>accept the situation that you're in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true.</v>

750
00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.180
<v Speaker 1>We are like being like we're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth of the most incredible,</v>

751
00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:00.690
<v Speaker 1>most powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most omnipresent thing ever.</v>

752
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 1>We earlier when you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

753
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:04.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you smoked Dmt,</v>

754
00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:06.630
<v Speaker 1>you have this experience of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see God,</v>

755
00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:07.464
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this incredible matrix of </v>

756
00:37:09.901 --> 00:37:12.990
<v Speaker 1>consciousness or when you're on a per </v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically on Ios guy.</v>

757
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:13.913
<v Speaker 1>I haven't done it in mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the funny thing about it is right </v>

758
00:37:17.971 --> 00:37:22.971
<v Speaker 1>now minus the Psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are surrounded by an entire universe</v>

759
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:23.993
<v Speaker 1>of which pieces of the universe are </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive and aware of you and are talking </v>

760
00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:28.344
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to psychedelics sorta just force feeds </v>

761
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:32.900
<v Speaker 1>you that reality exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it paints it to.</v>

762
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 1>It puts a different coat of paint on top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

763
00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:39.110
<v Speaker 1>so now it seems unique novel again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

764
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.163
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just another level of the same </v>

765
00:37:41.281 --> 00:37:42.114
<v Speaker 1>experiences happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that you are surrounded by a </v>

766
00:37:44.881 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partially living,</v>

767
00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.900
<v Speaker 1>a universe that has a tendency from time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to time to produce life.</v>

768
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.473
<v Speaker 1>This universe that we're in produces </v>
<v Speaker 1>life and you're part of it and you're </v>

769
00:37:57.241 --> 00:38:00.900
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by an infinite ocean of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency,</v>

770
00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.870
<v Speaker 1>so that's very overwhelming I think for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

771
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.700
<v Speaker 1>which is why they begin to accept that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was just completely normal.</v>

772
00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:09.480
<v Speaker 1>This thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

773
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.970
<v Speaker 1>and then that's when you take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic and you're like,</v>

774
00:38:11.971 --> 00:38:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw God.</v>

775
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

776
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:18.030
<v Speaker 1>You saw the exact same thing that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been seeing.</v>

777
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:20.700
<v Speaker 1>It's only that you saw it in a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>form.</v>

778
00:38:20.701 --> 00:38:21.534
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to accept this stuff </v>

779
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:26.220
<v Speaker 1>that's happening around us right now as </v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

780
00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.530
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to accept it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't accept that.</v>

781
00:38:28.531 --> 00:38:31.380
<v Speaker 1>What this thing is around us is super </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural.</v>

782
00:38:31.381 --> 00:38:35.040
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what Joe was talking earlier,</v>

783
00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:36.020
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

784
00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:36.853
<v Speaker 6>foragers finding these substances.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking exactly what you're </v>

785
00:38:39.581 --> 00:38:40.414
<v Speaker 6>talking about because we take those </v>
<v Speaker 6>substances and it's like a revelation </v>

786
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 6>and the veil is pulled back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is the veil?</v>

787
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.113
<v Speaker 6>The veil is culture.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We live in a culture that is constantly </v>

788
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:54.880
<v Speaker 6>trying to put out the fire of mystery in</v>
<v Speaker 6>us.</v>

789
00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:58.210
<v Speaker 6>It's constantly saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no life is about having this car,</v>

790
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:00.970
<v Speaker 6>this kind of house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Get a new air conditioner,</v>

791
00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:01.990
<v Speaker 6>go to work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't,</v>

792
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:02.853
<v Speaker 6>don't be looking for mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just go to work and punch the fucking </v>

793
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:05.560
<v Speaker 6>clock.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All right,</v>

794
00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:08.200
<v Speaker 6>go work in your mind or your cubicle or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever.</v>

795
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:09.603
<v Speaker 6>It's trying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>constantly trying to get us to accept </v>

796
00:39:11.831 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 6>this bum fucking deal,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

797
00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 6>Whereas foragers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're surrounded by mystery everyday,</v>

798
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:21.070
<v Speaker 6>everyday everything's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything is full of spirit.</v>

799
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:23.640
<v Speaker 6>There's the spirit of the river.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The spirit of the clouds,</v>

800
00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.810
<v Speaker 6>the spirit of the air,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're surrounded by spirits,</v>

801
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.003
<v Speaker 6>so I wonder what their experience with </v>
<v Speaker 6>psychedelics is like because I don't </v>

802
00:39:30.431 --> 00:39:31.264
<v Speaker 6>think it has.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'm sure it heightens everything </v>

803
00:39:33.071 --> 00:39:37.090
<v Speaker 6>and is amazing and obviously has as </v>
<v Speaker 6>sacred value,</v>

804
00:39:37.690 --> 00:39:42.690
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think it has that same </v>
<v Speaker 6>revelatory aspect</v>

805
00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:45.933
<v Speaker 4>for regulatory thing because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 4>confined to the bullshit of like </v>

806
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:49.263
<v Speaker 4>buildings and streets and traffic lights</v>
<v Speaker 4>and taxes and all these things that we </v>

807
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:53.884
<v Speaker 4>hold in the forefront of our mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our consciousness that are really just </v>

808
00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.780
<v Speaker 4>retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've created these things.</v>

809
00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.673
<v Speaker 4>The most of the things that people come </v>
<v Speaker 4>up with to occupy their mind during the </v>

810
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:04.053
<v Speaker 4>day are things that we've come up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we've discovered or be or created </v>

811
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.333
<v Speaker 4>and be decided that there are </v>
<v Speaker 4>significant tax laws or jobs or social </v>

812
00:40:13.691 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 4>status for breeding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

813
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.513
<v Speaker 6>I think it gets back to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think the whole thing is an edifice </v>

814
00:40:20.491 --> 00:40:23.190
<v Speaker 6>built to distract ourselves from our </v>
<v Speaker 6>mortality.</v>

815
00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:25.520
<v Speaker 6>I think that's what civilization is.</v>

816
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.493
<v Speaker 4>It certainly could be or it could be a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanism for us to continue to create </v>

817
00:40:31.001 --> 00:40:31.834
<v Speaker 4>technology and innovate because the best</v>
<v Speaker 4>way to do that is to not have a good </v>

818
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:37.550
<v Speaker 4>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not have not realized that if,</v>

819
00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:38.260
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we,</v>

820
00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.093
<v Speaker 4>if our perspective is really good and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>realized that we're these temporary </v>

821
00:40:41.411 --> 00:40:45.880
<v Speaker 4>beings who just love each other and </v>
<v Speaker 4>spend as much time together in comradery</v>

822
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:48.460
<v Speaker 4>and friendship as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not going to get shit done.</v>

823
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.850
<v Speaker 4>We're all going to look at all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>phones we have now and then go.</v>

824
00:40:51.851 --> 00:40:52.684
<v Speaker 4>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We just keep using these phones and </v>

825
00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:55.114
<v Speaker 4>everyone's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We look at our tvs and that is a very </v>

826
00:40:57.041 --> 00:40:58.210
<v Speaker 4>big TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're good.</v>

827
00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.390
<v Speaker 4>My computer is super fast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're good.</v>

828
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:01.243
<v Speaker 4>My Internet seems fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just leave all this stuff alone </v>

829
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 4>and hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

830
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:06.490
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

831
00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:09.610
<v Speaker 6>You need the discontent to create the </v>
<v Speaker 6>technology.</v>

832
00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:10.444
<v Speaker 6>So the question is whose but,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but whose interest is all of in that </v>

833
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:16.630
<v Speaker 6>because it's not in ours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

834
00:41:16.631 --> 00:41:18.760
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the super organism.</v>

835
00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.980
<v Speaker 4>Marshall Mcluhan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>quote,</v>

836
00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:21.143
<v Speaker 4>Marshall Mcluhan's sex organs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the machine was my favorite quote </v>

837
00:41:24.391 --> 00:41:26.820
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think that one of the things we've</v>

838
00:41:26.821 --> 00:41:27.654
<v Speaker 4>done by lighting everything up also is </v>
<v Speaker 4>we've gotten rid of the psychedelic </v>

839
00:41:32.071 --> 00:41:34.220
<v Speaker 4>vision that is space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You no longer</v>

840
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.440
<v Speaker 2>see space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

841
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:36.283
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go on a trip to the desert and </v>

842
00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 2>you go out to the desert in the high </v>
<v Speaker 2>desert and you look up at night,</v>

843
00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:41.690
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

844
00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you get that majestic vision of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmos.</v>

845
00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:48.110
<v Speaker 2>We don't get it in la anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>

846
00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.090
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We smoked it out.</v>

847
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.910
<v Speaker 2>We smoked it out with streetlights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you got tomatoes,</v>

848
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:55.550
<v Speaker 2>that'll look good for a long time but </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't been fucking flavor.</v>

849
00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And roses that don't smell like roses,</v>

850
00:41:58.641 --> 00:41:59.474
<v Speaker 2>they don't what they smelled like </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing because because they've got to </v>

851
00:42:02.451 --> 00:42:06.560
<v Speaker 2>breathe that they will last much longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking good.</v>

852
00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.260
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't have the smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just spray perfume on them,</v>

853
00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do.</v>

854
00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:12.770
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

855
00:42:12.771 --> 00:42:14.930
<v Speaker 2>That's what they spray rose perfume on </v>
<v Speaker 2>roses.</v>

856
00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I went to dinner once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This French chick made me dinner.</v>

857
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:21.050
<v Speaker 2>This beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful French woman.</v>

858
00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:21.913
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't like anything she liked so </v>

859
00:42:25.281 --> 00:42:27.300
<v Speaker 2>it was a difficult relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

860
00:42:27.301 --> 00:42:28.134
<v Speaker 2>like she liked sailing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had this little sailboat and for me </v>

861
00:42:30.261 --> 00:42:34.390
<v Speaker 2>sailing is like skin cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guaranteed skin cancer.</v>

862
00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.500
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to be a pale because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>super pale.</v>

863
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:37.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm out on the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no shade,</v>

864
00:42:37.911 --> 00:42:39.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're waiting for wind,</v>

865
00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm dead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dead.</v>

866
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she made this dinner for me one night</v>

867
00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:48.020
<v Speaker 2>and I went to her place and everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>was beautiful and it was all set up with</v>

868
00:42:48.021 --> 00:42:49.140
<v Speaker 2>candles and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

869
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.480
<v Speaker 2>nice silver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

870
00:42:51.481 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 2>it was escar go fucking eat escargot go </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

871
00:42:55.851 --> 00:42:57.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat snails,</v>

872
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.190
<v Speaker 2>but I was going to go through it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she went to all this trouble.</v>

873
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:03.860
<v Speaker 2>Twenty eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>29 something.</v>

874
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:05.413
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she has this big pot of escargo </v>

875
00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:10.980
<v Speaker 2>shells in the sauce tomato sauce and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>puts it on her.</v>

876
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.410
<v Speaker 2>And so I pick up the first one and suck </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the sauce and there's no snap and I'm</v>

877
00:43:15.411 --> 00:43:16.370
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lucked out.</v>

878
00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.500
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it picked up the next one.</v>

879
00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Same thing again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no snail.</v>

880
00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:25.100
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking at her across the table </v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's getting this weird look on her</v>

881
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:27.680
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were no snails.</v>

882
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:31.850
<v Speaker 2>She'd bought the shells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They sell the snail separately.</v>

883
00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.320
<v Speaker 2>You have to put the snails back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shells.</v>

884
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:37.400
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

885
00:43:37.401 --> 00:43:38.234
<v Speaker 2>Something about you spraying perfume on </v>
<v Speaker 2>roses with no smell reminded me of that </v>

886
00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:46.260
<v Speaker 2>is so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she made a big pot of snail shell,</v>

887
00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:52.100
<v Speaker 2>snail shell suit tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snail's shell suit.</v>

888
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.780
<v Speaker 2>That's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snail shell suit.</v>

889
00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Snail shells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

890
00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:59.700
<v Speaker 2>My mouth doesn't want to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snare snail shell suit.</v>

891
00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Snail Shell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Snail snail.</v>

892
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:03.643
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is bizarre that they would separate </v>

893
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:06.824
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you take the snails out and </v>

894
00:44:07.941 --> 00:44:10.280
<v Speaker 2>make people put them back in maybe to </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean them?</v>

895
00:44:10.281 --> 00:44:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Shipping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

896
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.613
<v Speaker 2>Maybe a cleanliness issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then you would know that they </v>

897
00:44:14.811 --> 00:44:15.644
<v Speaker 2>weren't fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the whole idea is that you want to </v>

898
00:44:17.211 --> 00:44:19.500
<v Speaker 2>catch them and they do something to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

899
00:44:19.501 --> 00:44:20.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that,</v>

900
00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:21.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

901
00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:25.760
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy online who is a wild game </v>
<v Speaker 2>cook,</v>

902
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:29.580
<v Speaker 2>a famous wild game cook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's been on Steve Rinella,</v>

903
00:44:29.581 --> 00:44:32.350
<v Speaker 2>his television show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he does is</v>

904
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.450
<v Speaker 3>he takes wild foods like mushrooms and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

905
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:40.350
<v Speaker 3>and it incorporates than likely if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he eats like a deer,</v>

906
00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.373
<v Speaker 3>he cooks at deer meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll use like a lot of the local </v>

907
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:48.480
<v Speaker 3>ingredients like local plants and local </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms and things like that.</v>

908
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:49.763
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did that with some snails and he had </v>

909
00:44:51.961 --> 00:44:52.794
<v Speaker 3>to purge them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess you do something where you </v>

910
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.124
<v Speaker 3>take them and you like leave them in </v>
<v Speaker 3>water for a long period of time or </v>

911
00:44:59.011 --> 00:44:59.844
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like let them dedicate and let them </v>

912
00:45:01.171 --> 00:45:03.540
<v Speaker 3>pass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that might be.</v>

913
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.760
<v Speaker 3>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

914
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:10.220
<v Speaker 3>You don't want each snail pissed now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you eat lobster,</v>

915
00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:11.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That.</v>

916
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 3>Hold down the last line we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 3>fecal transplant.</v>

917
00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.870
<v Speaker 3>We have definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't stopped talking about it.</v>

918
00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:26.943
<v Speaker 3>It's pretty bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that microbes from another </v>

919
00:45:29.791 --> 00:45:31.560
<v Speaker 3>person's poop can actually help your </v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

920
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty wild.</v>

921
00:45:33.181 --> 00:45:34.014
<v Speaker 3>High being born vaginally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get your mother's microbiome all </v>

922
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:41.820
<v Speaker 3>over your skin and in your mouth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff from her genital secretions.</v>

923
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.640
<v Speaker 3>So when kids are born csection,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't get that.</v>

924
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:47.770
<v Speaker 3>They're much more likely to have asthma </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all this stuff because they.</v>

925
00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.130
<v Speaker 3>So what you got to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you have a c section,</v>

926
00:45:50.131 --> 00:45:52.830
<v Speaker 3>is smear pussy juice all over the kid's </v>
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>

927
00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:55.290
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you should say that.</v>

928
00:45:55.340 --> 00:46:00.090
<v Speaker 3>We should probably edit that out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just what the doctor ordered.</v>

929
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:00.953
<v Speaker 3>There are new rules,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this society and your pussy juice </v>

930
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:05.463
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

931
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.160
<v Speaker 3>That'll get you fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Yale,</v>

932
00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:13.270
<v Speaker 3>but over that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

933
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.340
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about before the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 3>started about the Social Justice Warrior</v>

934
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:22.020
<v Speaker 3>placemats that Harvard had given to </v>
<v Speaker 3>children to take home with them.</v>

935
00:46:22.021 --> 00:46:24.510
<v Speaker 3>And I say children because if your </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents are paying for your education,</v>

936
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.850
<v Speaker 3>your fucking child,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still a child.</v>

937
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:28.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care what.</v>

938
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.780
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you're 18,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if you could vote.</v>

939
00:46:29.781 --> 00:46:32.160
<v Speaker 3>I don't care if he can go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

940
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:32.994
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sent these placemats home with </v>

941
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:35.154
<v Speaker 3>these kids explaining how to talk to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your parents if controversial issues </v>

942
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:40.134
<v Speaker 3>come up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if your parents exhibit xenophobia </v>

943
00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:47.270
<v Speaker 3>or sexism transphobia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they literally are there.</v>

944
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.970
<v Speaker 3>They're giving them these placemats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

945
00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:51.893
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll pull it up.</v>

946
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.060
<v Speaker 3>The Harvard just apologize for it today </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the place mat.</v>

947
00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:56.243
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some intelligent people probably got </v>

948
00:46:57.691 --> 00:46:58.524
<v Speaker 3>ahold of him.</v>

949
00:46:58.590 --> 00:46:59.423
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're teaching people how to be only </v>

950
00:47:03.331 --> 00:47:04.164
<v Speaker 3>liberal progressive thinkers like think </v>
<v Speaker 3>only the way you guys want them to </v>

951
00:47:07.471 --> 00:47:08.304
<v Speaker 3>think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can they?</v>

952
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:09.263
<v Speaker 3>Are they allowed to have a nuanced </v>
<v Speaker 3>opinion on subjects that are </v>

953
00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:12.324
<v Speaker 3>controversial?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some things you're not </v>

954
00:47:13.771 --> 00:47:16.470
<v Speaker 3>allowed to have a nuanced opinion about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not even allowed to debate it,</v>

955
00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.890
<v Speaker 3>and that was what happened at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

956
00:47:17.891 --> 00:47:20.160
<v Speaker 3>when they were talking about offensive </v>
<v Speaker 3>Halloween costumes.</v>

957
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:25.050
<v Speaker 3>Here it is the Yale student active tips </v>
<v Speaker 3>for talking to family members.</v>

958
00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is hilarious.</v>

959
00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Listen mindfully before a formula and</v>

960
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:35.590
<v Speaker 5>thoughtful response.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When people express strong opinions,</v>

961
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:36.783
<v Speaker 5>affirm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>clarify the difference between the good </v>

962
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:40.270
<v Speaker 5>intentions and the impact.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Speak.</v>

963
00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.193
<v Speaker 5>Speak from a place of mutual interest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sharing personal experiences and </v>

964
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:46.300
<v Speaker 5>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

965
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:48.820
<v Speaker 5>And they talk about black murders in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>streets.</v>

966
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.620
<v Speaker 5>Why don't they just listened to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>officer if they,</v>

967
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:55.030
<v Speaker 5>if they just had obeyed the law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this wouldn't have happened.</v>

968
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:57.430
<v Speaker 5>Response.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me come on.</v>

969
00:47:57.431 --> 00:47:58.570
<v Speaker 5>Look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this hilarious.</v>

970
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:59.703
<v Speaker 5>Do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think the response would be the </v>

971
00:48:00.971 --> 00:48:03.430
<v Speaker 5>same if it was a white person being </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulled over,</v>

972
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:04.773
<v Speaker 5>like look at what they're doing here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is teaching people how to talk to </v>

973
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:13.240
<v Speaker 5>their parents about controversial social</v>
<v Speaker 5>issues like Islamophobia.</v>

974
00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:16.053
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is this that we shouldn't let </v>

975
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:20.890
<v Speaker 5>anyone in the US from Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We can't guarantee that terrorists won't</v>

976
00:48:20.891 --> 00:48:21.724
<v Speaker 5>infiltrate their.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the worst fucking Christmas </v>

977
00:48:23.351 --> 00:48:24.184
<v Speaker 5>dinner ever.</v>

978
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 5>Horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is not the Christmas dinner.</v>

979
00:48:28.691 --> 00:48:29.524
<v Speaker 5>There's a fucking o'reilly factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>US has been accepting refugees from the </v>

980
00:48:33.581 --> 00:48:35.980
<v Speaker 5>war torn areas around the world for </v>
<v Speaker 5>decades.</v>

981
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:36.814
<v Speaker 5>Remember the wars in Central America?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were extremely violent in the US </v>

982
00:48:39.371 --> 00:48:41.410
<v Speaker 5>accepted refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All right.</v>

983
00:48:41.411 --> 00:48:42.244
<v Speaker 5>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just boring Yale student activism </v>

984
00:48:44.501 --> 00:48:46.930
<v Speaker 5>one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why are the black students complaining?</v>

985
00:48:46.931 --> 00:48:50.080
<v Speaker 5>Shouldn't they be happy to be in college</v>
<v Speaker 5>response?</v>

986
00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:53.830
<v Speaker 5>When I hear students expressing their </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences of racism on campus,</v>

987
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.140
<v Speaker 5>I don't hear complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead,</v>

988
00:48:56.290 --> 00:49:01.180
<v Speaker 5>I hear young people uplifting is </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation that I may not.</v>

989
00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.150
<v Speaker 5>You know what my dad's doing it at this </v>
<v Speaker 5>point when I'm reading this,</v>

990
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:05.950
<v Speaker 5>my dad will start making ozark start </v>
<v Speaker 5>going.</v>

991
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.350
<v Speaker 5>By the way of lifting is not a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>verb.</v>

992
00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:18.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Know.</v>

993
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.860
<v Speaker 5>Could somebody tell her fancy boys sign?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need to,</v>

994
00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.910
<v Speaker 5>but there's a harvard placemat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about the ell student,</v>

995
00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:29.190
<v Speaker 5>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

996
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:33.790
<v Speaker 5>if non black students got the privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get the privilege of a safe environment,</v>

997
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.120
<v Speaker 5>I believe that same privilege should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>given to all students.</v>

998
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 5>Like you just said nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is a nonsense statement.</v>

999
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.520
<v Speaker 5>You don't hear them complaining when </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're complaining.</v>

1000
00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:43.420
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's bizarre.</v>

1001
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:45.400
<v Speaker 5>If people are complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're definitely complaining.</v>

1002
00:49:45.790 --> 00:49:46.930
<v Speaker 5>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Exactly.</v>

1003
00:49:46.931 --> 00:49:48.640
<v Speaker 5>There's nothing negative about </v>
<v Speaker 5>complaining.</v>

1004
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:50.650
<v Speaker 5>They might have a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't hear complaining,</v>

1005
00:49:50.651 --> 00:49:53.470
<v Speaker 5>then you're not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black murder section.</v>

1006
00:49:53.471 --> 00:49:55.900
<v Speaker 5>Now that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems pretty logical.</v>

1007
00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:58.720
<v Speaker 5>The response read it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you think their response would be the</v>

1008
00:49:58.721 --> 00:49:59.554
<v Speaker 5>same if there was a white person being </v>
<v Speaker 5>pulled over in many incidents that </v>

1009
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:05.830
<v Speaker 5>result in the death of a black body in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the street?</v>

1010
00:50:05.831 --> 00:50:06.664
<v Speaker 5>These victims are not breaking the law </v>
<v Speaker 5>and are unarmed with Tamir seems right </v>

1011
00:50:10.841 --> 00:50:11.674
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a 12 year old boy playing in the </v>

1012
00:50:12.851 --> 00:50:14.860
<v Speaker 5>park.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the officers pulled up,</v>

1013
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:15.694
<v Speaker 5>they gave no verbal commands and shot </v>
<v Speaker 5>within two seconds of arriving at the </v>

1014
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:21.280
<v Speaker 5>scene.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was not breaking any laws.</v>

1015
00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 5>You know this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just because I just watched someone</v>

1016
00:50:23.951 --> 00:50:27.260
<v Speaker 5>made a youtube montage of cops shooting </v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

1017
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 5>It's insane it</v>

1018
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.020
<v Speaker 4>you've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:30.300
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1020
00:50:30.301 --> 00:50:31.134
<v Speaker 4>and I was thinking my Christ man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I was black and got pulled over by a </v>

1021
00:50:33.411 --> 00:50:35.220
<v Speaker 4>cop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be shitting myself.</v>

1022
00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because they just shoot.</v>

1023
00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:38.173
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with someone who is </v>

1024
00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 4>encountering bad people all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the people that cops and counter</v>

1025
00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:44.954
<v Speaker 4>all day or breaking the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the people that are either </v>

1026
00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:47.534
<v Speaker 4>pulling them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulling them over for going too fast or </v>

1027
00:50:49.431 --> 00:50:50.264
<v Speaker 4>they're doing something stupid or </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to steal something and </v>

1028
00:50:52.221 --> 00:50:53.054
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to rob somebody or </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're showing up at a scene after </v>

1029
00:50:55.101 --> 00:50:56.780
<v Speaker 4>someone's done something fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:50:56.781 --> 00:50:57.614
<v Speaker 4>So just think about the stress that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>normal person's under and multiply that </v>

1031
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:03.320
<v Speaker 4>times 100.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get paid like 40 grand a year.</v>

1032
00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:04.520
<v Speaker 4>People want to shoot out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:51:04.521 --> 00:51:07.880
<v Speaker 4>You weren't a goddamn bulletproof vest </v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to someone,</v>

1034
00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:12.290
<v Speaker 4>someone's car and it's a young black guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he doesn't use his rap.</v>

1035
00:51:12.291 --> 00:51:14.030
<v Speaker 4>Music is loud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not even turning it down.</v>

1036
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.320
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God damn it is today.</v>

1037
00:51:15.321 --> 00:51:18.050
<v Speaker 4>The day I get shot and killed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or I say the day I die</v>

1038
00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:21.530
<v Speaker 2>and let's not forget that a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes are coming back from wars.</v>

1039
00:51:21.531 --> 00:51:22.364
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of them have ptsd and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained where they were an occupying </v>

1040
00:51:25.201 --> 00:51:26.630
<v Speaker 2>force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

1041
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:29.850
<v Speaker 2>they take that training and they apply </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to joining the police force.</v>

1042
00:51:29.851 --> 00:51:33.720
<v Speaker 2>And the population is the enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is a potential,</v>

1043
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1045
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 4>I got into a conversation with my uber </v>
<v Speaker 4>driver,</v>

1046
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:39.763
<v Speaker 4>this black dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was like a talking about getting </v>

1047
00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:44.120
<v Speaker 4>pulled over recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I told him,</v>

1048
00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:45.590
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't been pulled over and like,</v>

1049
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.510

<v Speaker 4>nine years.</v>

1050
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.060
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

1051

<v Speaker 2>I'm white lol.</v>

1052
00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 4>He gets pulled over all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1053
00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.090
<v Speaker 4>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fucked up man.</v>

1054
00:52:00.091 --> 00:52:04.580
<v Speaker 4>Like that's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that to live in that kind of world where</v>

1055
00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.713
<v Speaker 4>you realize that you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just have to accept getting pulled </v>

1056
00:52:07.461 --> 00:52:08.294
<v Speaker 4>over and you have to accept the fact </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there is some chance if you make </v>

1057
00:52:11.721 --> 00:52:12.554
<v Speaker 4>the wrong move or if the cops snaps </v>
<v Speaker 4>because of for whatever reason you're </v>

1058
00:52:16.521 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 4>dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That happens all the time.</v>

1059
00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 4>There was that one where the cops pulled</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy over and there's a video of him,</v>

1060
00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.130
<v Speaker 4>the completely different interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The cop described,</v>

1061
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:26.203
<v Speaker 4>the guy pulls his gun out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could just shoots the guy in this </v>

1062
00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 4>fucking car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's in trouble knowing scared.</v>

1063
00:52:30.891 --> 00:52:33.410
<v Speaker 4>No one's in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Terrible people</v>

1064
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:36.870
<v Speaker 2>just shouldn't be cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's definitely people that shouldn't</v>

1065
00:52:36.871 --> 00:52:38.820
<v Speaker 2>be cops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people.</v>

1066
00:52:38.821 --> 00:52:39.654
<v Speaker 2>How about that and what about these </v>
<v Speaker 2>cases where they like swat the right </v>

1067
00:52:42.431 --> 00:52:45.080
<v Speaker 2>into someone's house in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the night and shoot them in bed and then</v>

1068
00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:45.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1069
00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.670
<v Speaker 2>wrong house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or they shoot a dog.</v>

1070
00:52:48.610 --> 00:52:49.950
<v Speaker 2>They love shooting the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1071
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:52.080
<v Speaker 2>and taking the property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

1072
00:52:52.081 --> 00:52:53.550
<v Speaker 2>This country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're motivated.</v>

1073
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated,</v>

1074
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:56.880
<v Speaker 2>motivated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated.</v>

1075
00:52:56.881 --> 00:52:57.714
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a word they're incentivized as </v>

1076
00:52:59.111 --> 00:53:02.160
<v Speaker 2>far as two to get into shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1077
00:53:02.161 --> 00:53:03.300
<v Speaker 2>to get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into trouble,</v>

1078
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:06.210
<v Speaker 2>find trouble because they get the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get the car and there's,</v>

1079
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.053
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2015 cops took more property than </v>

1080
00:53:10.321 --> 00:53:11.300
<v Speaker 2>burglars did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1081
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:13.523
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute and that goes right into </v>

1082
00:53:19.111 --> 00:53:19.944
<v Speaker 2>the local police department's budget and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he doesn't even go to Washington and </v>

1083
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.110
<v Speaker 2>they bought Margarita machines and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina to</v>

1084
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.270
<v Speaker 1>see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't see that.</v>

1085
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:31.170
<v Speaker 1>They will pull them over and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>take it and say,</v>

1086
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out a way to prove to</v>

1087
00:53:33.031 --> 00:53:33.864
<v Speaker 1>us that this money was made illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The asset forfeiture surpass burglaries </v>

1088
00:53:36.991 --> 00:53:39.900
<v Speaker 1>for the first time ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy important point.</v>

1089
00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:42.480
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have to be charged with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the crime.</v>

1090
00:53:42.481 --> 00:53:43.314
<v Speaker 1>They can just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing walking around with </v>

1091
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:47.280
<v Speaker 1>10 grand in cash and you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to prove.</v>

1092
00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:48.323
<v Speaker 1>And also think about how much of this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to drugs and then so when you </v>

1093
00:53:51.751 --> 00:53:52.584
<v Speaker 1>realize the asset forfeiture is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening for something that shouldn't </v>

1094
00:53:55.801 --> 00:53:58.050
<v Speaker 1>be illegal anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like do you watch,</v>

1095
00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:00.990
<v Speaker 1>have you watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called drunk tank.</v>

1096
00:54:00.991 --> 00:54:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen this show where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

1097
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:07.020
<v Speaker 1>it shows it's a show where after someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets pulled over for a Dui,</v>

1098
00:54:07.021 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 1>they get thrown in the drunk tank and </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1099
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:10.554
<v Speaker 1>there's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing more viral than seeing a cop </v>

1100
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:14.663
<v Speaker 1>smugly like searching a person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling marijuana out of his pocket and </v>

1101
00:54:19.501 --> 00:54:20.191
<v Speaker 1>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1102
00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:22.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do we have here?</v>

1103
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:25.530
<v Speaker 1>Marrow wanna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

1104
00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.633
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>history is going to judge in the most </v>

1105
00:54:30.301 --> 00:54:31.134
<v Speaker 1>intense way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single cop that's been on a </v>

1106
00:54:33.181 --> 00:54:37.530
<v Speaker 1>reality show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smugly taking someone's weed for them,</v>

1107
00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:41.220
<v Speaker 1>putting handcuffs on them because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had weed for eternity,</v>

1108
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:45.030
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be looked back on in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fucking awful way.</v>

1109
00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.983
<v Speaker 1>They're going to want to scrub the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet from some of that footage </v>

1110
00:54:48.061 --> 00:54:51.300
<v Speaker 1>because they're enforcing a law that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1111
00:54:51.301 --> 00:54:52.134
<v Speaker 1>we all preaching the choir here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's something so foul about it </v>

1112
00:54:55.591 --> 00:54:57.030
<v Speaker 1>that smugness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1113
00:54:57.031 --> 00:54:59.970
<v Speaker 1>it's so disgusting for nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for nothing,</v>

1114
00:54:59.971 --> 00:55:01.770
<v Speaker 1>for literally nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally nothing.</v>

1115
00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:03.330
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1116
00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:05.970
<v Speaker 1>not less than nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something they enjoy.</v>

1117
00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:08.180
<v Speaker 1>It's not just for nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1118
00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.093
<v Speaker 1>it's more we're</v>

1119
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.120
<v Speaker 2>discussing that because it's positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's beneficial,</v>

1120
00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:16.270
<v Speaker 2>it enhances their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes food taste better.</v>

1121
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:17.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1122
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:20.370
<v Speaker 2>that gets us back to the seeing God in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushroom,</v>

1123
00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:21.213
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1124
00:55:21.790 --> 00:55:22.623
<v Speaker 2>Every culture that's ever had access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucinogens have seen them as the </v>

1125
00:55:25.871 --> 00:55:27.900
<v Speaker 2>greatest gift of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1126
00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.833
<v Speaker 2>The most sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most beautiful gifts they've been </v>

1127
00:55:30.281 --> 00:55:32.950
<v Speaker 2>given in our country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States.</v>

1128
00:55:32.951 --> 00:55:35.290
<v Speaker 2>You go to prison for longer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under minimum.</v>

1129
00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:39.060
<v Speaker 2>Mandatory for having a LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>LSD.</v>

1130
00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:39.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1131
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:41.670
<v Speaker 2>LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then for second degree murder.</v>

1132
00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:43.883
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not only wasteful and weird and </v>

1133
00:55:47.471 --> 00:55:50.860
<v Speaker 2>awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's the and and to me that,</v>

1134
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:51.833
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ties into my argument that we live in a </v>

1135
00:55:53.321 --> 00:55:57.810
<v Speaker 2>culture that it sets out to deny </v>
<v Speaker 2>mystery.</v>

1136
00:55:57.850 --> 00:55:58.683
<v Speaker 2>This is where I differ from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the culture sets out to </v>

1137
00:56:01.841 --> 00:56:02.674
<v Speaker 2>deny it or if all these things are kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of in place and they all benefit each </v>

1138
00:56:05.921 --> 00:56:10.840
<v Speaker 2>other and the overall result is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture denies it's reality.</v>

1139
00:56:11.050 --> 00:56:13.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think there's any </v>
<v Speaker 2>design involved.</v>

1140
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1141
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:17.290
<v Speaker 2>see this is it designed versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>

1142
00:56:17.291 --> 00:56:18.124
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a system that replicates </v>

1143
00:56:19.871 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>itself and supports itself and spins out</v>
<v Speaker 2>sub that support</v>

1144
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.810
<v Speaker 5>the central mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1145
00:56:25.811 --> 00:56:26.644
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think Henry Kissinger's behind </v>

1146
00:56:27.971 --> 00:56:29.620
<v Speaker 5>it know I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know you don't,</v>

1147
00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.513
<v Speaker 5>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think there's anyone that </v>

1148
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:32.733
<v Speaker 5>doesn't want us.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Anyone that doesn't want us to be aware </v>

1149
00:56:36.340 --> 00:56:37.173
<v Speaker 5>of art.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't think anybody's attention </v>

1150
00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:39.273
<v Speaker 5>entire advertising industry doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 5>us to know the reality of what they're </v>

1151
00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:43.690
<v Speaker 5>selling.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not even.</v>

1152
00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:44.770
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's different.</v>

1153
00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:45.641
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1154
00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:46.930
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're trying.</v>

1155
00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:48.530
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1156
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:49.790
<v Speaker 5>Edward Bernays,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

1157
00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.000
<v Speaker 5>The Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1158
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:51.963
<v Speaker 5>The Guy who founded advertising </v>
<v Speaker 5>essentially and also worked for the CIA </v>

1159
00:56:54.671 --> 00:56:58.360
<v Speaker 5>also came up with the word defending </v>
<v Speaker 5>freedom abroad,</v>

1160
00:56:58.361 --> 00:57:01.210
<v Speaker 5>justification for American military </v>
<v Speaker 5>adventures.</v>

1161
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:04.220
<v Speaker 5>I mean he was central and he very </v>
<v Speaker 5>clearly said like,</v>

1162
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:05.253
<v Speaker 5>we need to create reality for people </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if they are allowed to create </v>

1163
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:11.140
<v Speaker 5>their own reality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they won't buy stuff.</v>

1164
00:57:11.141 --> 00:57:12.550
<v Speaker 5>They won't do what we need them to do.</v>

1165
00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:14.530
<v Speaker 5>They won't vote for who we need them to </v>
<v Speaker 5>vote for.</v>

1166
00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.270
<v Speaker 5>So there's an elite that has to create </v>
<v Speaker 5>reality for the masses and it's logical.</v>

1167
00:57:19.271 --> 00:57:20.450
<v Speaker 5>If you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if we will,</v>

1168
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:21.303
<v Speaker 5>if we got assigned to and we are </v>
<v Speaker 5>assholes and we got assigned to some </v>

1169
00:57:25.241 --> 00:57:28.600
<v Speaker 5>massive group of people that we needed </v>
<v Speaker 5>to control and we needed to,</v>

1170
00:57:28.601 --> 00:57:30.970
<v Speaker 5>like we needed them to think that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>were in charge.</v>

1171
00:57:30.971 --> 00:57:31.804
<v Speaker 5>That was the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would have certain rules that you </v>

1172
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:34.624
<v Speaker 5>had that they had to abide by and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>first rule would be don't let them take </v>

1173
00:57:38.141 --> 00:57:40.870
<v Speaker 5>psychedelics man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if they start fucking tripping,</v>

1174
00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:41.913
<v Speaker 5>they're going to realize we're just </v>
<v Speaker 5>three dudes just like listen to us </v>

1175
00:57:46.181 --> 00:57:47.014
<v Speaker 5>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Which is why I think there is a five </v>

1176
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:53.581
<v Speaker 5>year mandatory minimum when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 5>lsd because when you take Lsd,</v>

1177
00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 5>the entire thing seems absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 5>absurd.</v>

1178
00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:57.723
<v Speaker 5>From money to the government to jobs at </v>
<v Speaker 5>all seems like a ridiculous thing that </v>

1179
00:58:02.951 --> 00:58:04.660
<v Speaker 5>everyone else seems to have accepted as </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1180
00:58:04.661 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just how you do shit.</v>

1181
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:06.850
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But question,</v>

1182
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:07.713
<v Speaker 5>the people that are enforcing the laws </v>
<v Speaker 5>are not the people that created those </v>

1183
00:58:10.301 --> 00:58:11.134
<v Speaker 5>laws and the people that are enforcing </v>
<v Speaker 5>the laws most certainly have not </v>

1184
00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:15.724
<v Speaker 5>experienced these things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why we need to get comps </v>

1185
00:58:18.401 --> 00:58:19.300
<v Speaker 5>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1186
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:21.580
<v Speaker 5>but you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I agree.</v>

1187
00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:22.923
<v Speaker 5>I think that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain momentum that these </v>

1188
00:58:26.051 --> 00:58:26.884
<v Speaker 5>laws and that this propaganda has sort </v>
<v Speaker 5>of set in motion that's going to be </v>

1189
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:33.430
<v Speaker 5>really hard to slow down and stop and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're starting to do that with pot.</v>

1190
00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.133
<v Speaker 5>The availability and the relaxation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The way people view pot in 2015 is way </v>

1191
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:45.340
<v Speaker 5>different than 2005 or two.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's,</v>

1192
00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:46.293
<v Speaker 5>there's a approved research going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a fantastic clinical </v>

1193
00:58:49.271 --> 00:58:50.800
<v Speaker 5>application,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1194
00:58:50.801 --> 00:58:53.980
<v Speaker 5>and the old guard has to die.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well yeah,</v>

1195
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:55.770
<v Speaker 5>it works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1196
00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:56.603
<v Speaker 5>people that started those laws,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the fucking Joe Friday's dragnet guys </v>

1197
00:59:00.810 --> 00:59:01.643
<v Speaker 5>like those guys are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like the people that like started </v>

1198
00:59:04.871 --> 00:59:09.700
<v Speaker 5>this whole sweeping psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>legislation act of 1970,</v>

1199
00:59:09.701 --> 00:59:11.320
<v Speaker 5>I believe it was when they made </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything scheduled.</v>

1200
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:12.453
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were just trying to batten down the </v>

1201
00:59:13.961 --> 00:59:15.790
<v Speaker 5>hatches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have to stop these fucking hippies.</v>

1202
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.490
<v Speaker 5>Like everything was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The response to Vietnam War,</v>

1203
00:59:18.491 --> 00:59:19.520
<v Speaker 5>but he wanted to get out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was,</v>

1204
00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.680
<v Speaker 5>it was the culture</v>

1205
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.933
<v Speaker 4>explosion that was going on and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were trying to throw a wet blankets on </v>

1206
00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:26.990
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're trying to figure out how to do it,</v>

1207
00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:29.180
<v Speaker 4>but those people that did that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all dead.</v>

1208
00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:33.620
<v Speaker 4>So these new sort of dea people in drug </v>
<v Speaker 4>enforcement officers,</v>

1209
00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:34.863
<v Speaker 4>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're operating under this assumption </v>

1210
00:59:37.641 --> 00:59:38.474
<v Speaker 4>that what they're doing is in some way </v>
<v Speaker 4>good because it's been in place for a </v>

1211
00:59:42.621 --> 00:59:45.290
<v Speaker 4>long time and this is just how it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And look,</v>

1212
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:47.210
<v Speaker 4>there's a reason why heroin is illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>son.</v>

1213
00:59:47.211 --> 00:59:49.130
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why cocaine's illegal </v>
<v Speaker 4>son,</v>

1214
00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.990
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marijuana is going to rot your brain.</v>

1215
00:59:51.060 --> 00:59:53.720
<v Speaker 4>So you do marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why are,</v>

1216
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 4>why are mushrooms illegal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've done mushrooms,</v>

1217
00:59:56.060 --> 00:59:58.010
<v Speaker 4>if you've done mushrooms and you think </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're illegals,</v>

1218
00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:00.020
<v Speaker 4>something went wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something went wrong.</v>

1219
01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:04.290
<v Speaker 4>Either you tried to fight it and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>trip took you sideways or you know,</v>

1220
01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:07.040
<v Speaker 4>you didn't get enough of it or you did </v>
<v Speaker 4>it with assholes.</v>

1221
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 1>If you were to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1222
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing you probably net,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a name for it.</v>

1223
01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>When somebody gets invested into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion or a cult,</v>

1224
01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.733
<v Speaker 1>you get no called and after you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>invested yourself for a certain amount </v>

1225
01:00:19.681 --> 01:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get really like sucked into the</v>

1226
01:00:22.651 --> 01:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>cult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1227
01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the fact that you've been in it for</v>

1228
01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

1229
01:00:26.731 --> 01:00:27.564
<v Speaker 1>10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years is enough to keep you in even </v>

1230
01:00:29.641 --> 01:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>though you know it's complete bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and see you stay in it only because like</v>

1231
01:00:32.881 --> 01:00:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've invested too much energy.</v>

1232
01:00:34.591 --> 01:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Like when they predict the apocalypse </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it doesn't happen,</v>

1233
01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and those people just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1234
01:00:38.611 --> 01:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't shake their ego is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely committed to it.</v>

1235
01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.303
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if like your entire life you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been enforcing legislation that was </v>

1236
01:00:48.781 --> 01:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>completely absurd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't based on anything,</v>

1237
01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>that in reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in fact for your entire life,</v>

1238
01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:56.883
<v Speaker 1>you are a enforcing legislation that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way dampening or pushing your </v>

1239
01:01:01.921 --> 01:01:02.754
<v Speaker 1>society back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing back the evolution of your </v>

1240
01:01:04.831 --> 01:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>culture and you have to come to terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that you did that.</v>

1241
01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:10.253
<v Speaker 1>You are an agent of the state and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforced laws that shouldn't have been </v>

1242
01:01:13.771 --> 01:01:15.540
<v Speaker 1>there at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1243
01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:16.403
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking tough pill to swallow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that you may have killed some </v>

1244
01:01:19.351 --> 01:01:20.184
<v Speaker 1>people use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people out there who have put </v>

1245
01:01:22.471 --> 01:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>bullets in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in people just for growing marijuana,</v>

1246
01:01:25.951 --> 01:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>something out of the ground or for being</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Afghany adolescent,</v>

1247
01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:30.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1248
01:01:30.811 --> 01:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>think about all the soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what the PTSD is all about,</v>

1249
01:01:33.511 --> 01:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're coming back and they're like,</v>

1250
01:01:35.460 --> 01:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>what the f?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed three vets on my show.</v>

1251
01:01:37.621 --> 01:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I did sort of a series of interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tangentially speaking,</v>

1252
01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.850
<v Speaker 1>available on itunes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

1253
01:01:45.790 --> 01:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1254
01:01:47.131 --> 01:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>that's some of the stuff that comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1255
01:01:48.751 --> 01:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like fucking shoot people because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there and that's what you do.</v>

1256
01:01:52.801 --> 01:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>And they moved and they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to come to terms with it,</v>

1258
01:01:57.121 --> 01:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just have to come to terms with it,</v>

1259
01:01:58.741 --> 01:01:59.574
<v Speaker 1>but you have to come to terms with it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's cowardly to continue to </v>

1260
01:02:01.861 --> 01:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>fucking enforce a goddamn thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you know that it's no longer</v>

1261
01:02:06.570 --> 01:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>a relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no need to do it.</v>

1262
01:02:08.461 --> 01:02:09.294
<v Speaker 1>There never was a need to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to take the bitter pill </v>

1263
01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>and go through a few fucking days of </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling guilty,</v>

1264
01:02:14.790 --> 01:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and understand that,</v>

1265
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:20.160
<v Speaker 1>that what you did was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real easy thing</v>

1266
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:21.023
<v Speaker 4>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem is until the laws get </v>

1267
01:02:22.621 --> 01:02:23.454
<v Speaker 4>changed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to seem real to people </v>

1268
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:26.243
<v Speaker 4>that are still caught up in the haze of </v>
<v Speaker 4>culture because culture has kind of a </v>

1269
01:02:31.321 --> 01:02:34.260
<v Speaker 4>haze like you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get sucked into it and you're in it,</v>

1270
01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:35.094
<v Speaker 4>and that's why people do different </v>
<v Speaker 4>things in different places and it seems </v>

1271
01:02:36.961 --> 01:02:37.794
<v Speaker 4>normal to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we see it though what they eat </v>

1272
01:02:39.481 --> 01:02:40.550
<v Speaker 4>with sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1273
01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:41.880
<v Speaker 4>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking crazy,</v>

1274
01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.201
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1275
01:02:42.201 --> 01:02:46.230
<v Speaker 4>they know about spoons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like culture becomes the norm.</v>

1276
01:02:46.231 --> 01:02:47.064
<v Speaker 4>It becomes what you accept and right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>our culture accepts the fact that you </v>

1277
01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:53.310
<v Speaker 4>get locked up for drugs and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>want your kids to be a druggie.</v>

1278
01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:55.090
<v Speaker 4>You don't want your kid to be a loser if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1279
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:57.090
<v Speaker 4>because they become potheads and become </v>
<v Speaker 4>lazy.</v>

1280
01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.043
<v Speaker 4>We have these thoughts that were really </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the seeds were started in the 19 </v>

1281
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:03.910
<v Speaker 4>thirties with all those crazy reefer </v>
<v Speaker 4>madness.</v>

1282
01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:04.853
<v Speaker 4>It just means it's the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just has gotten less and less </v>

1283
01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:09.510
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but no one,</v>

1284
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:12.460
<v Speaker 4>like even to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you talk about getting high,</v>

1285
01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:13.503
<v Speaker 4>talking about smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the vast majority of people look at it </v>

1286
01:03:16.261 --> 01:03:18.780
<v Speaker 4>the same way as if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got fucked up.</v>

1287
01:03:18.781 --> 01:03:21.540
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we went and drank and I got hammered.</v>

1288
01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:22.374
<v Speaker 4>I was so blasted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's a very big difference in </v>

1289
01:03:24.391 --> 01:03:25.224
<v Speaker 4>what it's doing to your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one of them is closing off </v>

1290
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:28.344
<v Speaker 4>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of them is opening up awareness and </v>

1291
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:32.700
<v Speaker 4>we're putting them in the same category </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is not a knock on alcoholic.</v>

1292
01:03:32.701 --> 01:03:34.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Enjoy it,</v>

1293
01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.930
<v Speaker 4>but it's a completely different </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>

1294
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:40.320
<v Speaker 4>But when you explain it to people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll look at you the same way.</v>

1295
01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:41.730
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys got stoned,</v>

1296
01:03:41.731 --> 01:03:43.620
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fucking crazy kids,</v>

1297
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.823
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile you got stoned and might have </v>

1298
01:03:45.761 --> 01:03:48.900
<v Speaker 4>realized exactly what was wrong in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship and you know,</v>

1299
01:03:48.901 --> 01:03:49.734
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and tried to fix your life and like </v>

1300
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.250
<v Speaker 4>wrote something down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be like the new chart,</v>

1301
01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:56.130
<v Speaker 4>the new path of your destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like more,</v>

<v Speaker 1>talk about that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that thing you're talking about,</v>

1312
01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:19.973
<v Speaker 1>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it's no different than </v>

1313
01:04:21.481 --> 01:04:23.820
<v Speaker 1>people in North Korea praying the dear </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>

1314
01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:25.350
<v Speaker 1>It's when you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have been.</v>

1315
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:27.420
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how old you are,</v>

1316
01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you have been a in a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war on drugs.</v>

1317
01:04:30.691 --> 01:04:33.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a real war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a war where people have been killed</v>

1318
01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:36.810
<v Speaker 1>and imprisoned and as part of all wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda,</v>

1319
01:04:36.811 --> 01:04:38.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to have private money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

1320
01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:39.773
<v Speaker 1>but you have been conditioned by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>very intense brainwashing that was </v>

1321
01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:48.000
<v Speaker 1>created by the CIA to try to control </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind.</v>

1322
01:04:48.001 --> 01:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And so you have been infected with </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>

1323
01:04:50.581 --> 01:04:52.500
<v Speaker 1>If you think that drugs should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal,</v>

1324
01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:57.140
<v Speaker 1>you are a victim of the drug war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>another know another fucking casualty of</v>

1325
01:04:57.141 --> 01:04:57.974
<v Speaker 1>the drug war.</v>

1326
01:04:58.110 --> 01:04:58.943
<v Speaker 1>Truth man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking like how much I lied to </v>

1327
01:05:02.161 --> 01:05:06.090
<v Speaker 1>my mom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in high school taking Lsd,</v>

1328
01:05:06.270 --> 01:05:09.570
<v Speaker 1>having these powerful life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing experiences,</v>

1329
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.673
<v Speaker 1>beautiful experiences where I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing so much about society and </v>

1330
01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:15.144
<v Speaker 1>myself and a lot of Shit I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand and I would have loved to </v>

1331
01:05:18.281 --> 01:05:19.114
<v Speaker 1>have talked to my mom about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't talk to my mom about it </v>

1332
01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>because if my mom found out I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Lsd,</v>

1333
01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>she would freak out and parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go through their kid's drawers.</v>

1334
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:30.033
<v Speaker 1>They become agents of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're digging through their kid's </v>

1335
01:05:32.681 --> 01:05:33.514
<v Speaker 1>drawers to try to find a substance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been on the planet for a very long </v>

1336
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:38.284
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana or a substance like lsd that </v>

1337
01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:40.894
<v Speaker 1>is profoundly beneficial to a person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes it and the right way and they've </v>

1338
01:05:45.971 --> 01:05:50.530
<v Speaker 1>become agents of the state and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're forcing this in their house,</v>

1339
01:05:50.590 --> 01:05:51.423
<v Speaker 1>in the home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be a place of absolute </v>

1340
01:05:53.051 --> 01:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>truth and trust and acceptance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

1341
01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It's been transformed into this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Weird Gulag.</v>

1342
01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:01.654
<v Speaker 1>It's been turned into this bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison place where the parents somehow </v>

1343
01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:11.671
<v Speaker 1>have got to enforce these absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary laws and that I can't,</v>

1344
01:06:13.361 --> 01:06:14.194
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that anyone is ever going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to calculate how much damage </v>

1345
01:06:17.081 --> 01:06:17.914
<v Speaker 1>that is done to society that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed our teens into a position where </v>

1346
01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:22.594
<v Speaker 1>they have to fucking lie to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents about having the most profound </v>

1347
01:06:25.331 --> 01:06:26.164
<v Speaker 1>experience accessible via chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people that think </v>

1348
01:06:30.071 --> 01:06:32.620
<v Speaker 1>that you shouldn't fuck with any </v>
<v Speaker 1>entheogens,</v>

1349
01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:36.190
<v Speaker 1>any psychedelics while you're a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a young developing mind.</v>

1350
01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not one of them when I can't,</v>

1351
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.823
<v Speaker 1>I can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do all that all through high </v>

1352
01:06:43.211 --> 01:06:45.760
<v Speaker 1>school and I absolutely am so grateful </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

1353
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:46.803
<v Speaker 1>I'm so grateful for the information </v>
<v Speaker 1>stream because I didn't have the </v>

1354
01:06:49.181 --> 01:06:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Internet man and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1355
01:06:50.611 --> 01:06:52.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my encounter with a,</v>

1356
01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:56.500
<v Speaker 1>what lsd was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was through pure government propaganda.</v>

1357
01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.333
<v Speaker 1>Like it was like finding books where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about Timothy leary is an insane </v>

1358
01:07:00.941 --> 01:07:03.560
<v Speaker 1>lunatic who lost his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1359
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.513
<v Speaker 1>that paints a picture of people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>advocates of the psychedelic experience </v>

1360
01:07:09.531 --> 01:07:10.364
<v Speaker 1>as being some kind of evil drug addled </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunatics as opposed to being what they </v>

1361
01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:15.514
<v Speaker 1>really are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is rebels and heroes and a </v>

1362
01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:22.300
<v Speaker 1>completely insane a war that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed countless lives.</v>

1363
01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:24.700
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't able to like go on the Internet</v>

1364
01:07:24.701 --> 01:07:28.570
<v Speaker 1>and look this shit up and find out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed this experience that I'm having,</v>

1365
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:33.070
<v Speaker 1>which appears to be beneficial is truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to a great many people.</v>

1366
01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>All I had was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you're gonna,</v>

1367
01:07:35.850 --> 01:07:38.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take five hits of acid,</v>

1368
01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:39.333
<v Speaker 1>you're legally insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or the old classic image show to take </v>

1369
01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:45.904
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm covered if I do something good </v>

1370
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>clover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same lost my mind.</v>

1371
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:52.823
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk like from the 1940 </v>

1372
01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:56.670
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] from now on the fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in saying,</v>

1373
01:07:58.330 --> 01:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean by this beneficial </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience?</v>

1374
01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sad,</v>

1375
01:08:04.151 --> 01:08:04.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>

1376
01:08:04.961 --> 01:08:08.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's what's really sad about is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>other wars,</v>

1377
01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.370
<v Speaker 1>the casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1378
01:08:09.371 --> 01:08:12.070
<v Speaker 1>we build walls with names on them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other wars,</v>

1379
01:08:12.071 --> 01:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>but in this particular war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many people who were just farmers</v>

1380
01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:17.053
<v Speaker 2>and alchemists are laying in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>graves and nobody realizes that these </v>

1381
01:08:21.471 --> 01:08:22.304
<v Speaker 2>were heroes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were people who were in the face </v>

1382
01:08:24.591 --> 01:08:25.424
<v Speaker 2>of insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making the decision that regardless of </v>

1383
01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:31.460
<v Speaker 2>what the state was telling them to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to follow their hearts.</v>

1384
01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:32.533
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of them went to jail for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them are in jail for political </v>

1385
01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 2>prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the word.</v>

1386
01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.453
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very strange how hard it is for </v>

1387
01:08:39.261 --> 01:08:40.094
<v Speaker 2>us to break momentum of habit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's part of what's going on is </v>

1388
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:46.940
<v Speaker 2>there's a momentum of habit that looks </v>
<v Speaker 2>at all these things as being negative.</v>

1389
01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a governmental system that's</v>

1390
01:08:49.431 --> 01:08:52.590
<v Speaker 2>supremely unresponsive to new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1391
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Because of the way Congress has set up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things is changing that I</v>

1392
01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:56.384
<v Speaker 2>think is what's happening in Colorado </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the tax revenue in Oregon in </v>

1393
01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Oregon.</v>

1394
01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:03.350
<v Speaker 2>But Colorado has a longer history of it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

1395
01:09:03.351 --> 01:09:04.184
<v Speaker 2>They've made more money for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>time ever from marijuana and taxes than </v>

1396
01:09:06.861 --> 01:09:10.400
<v Speaker 2>they do alcohol and crime goes down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crime went down,</v>

1397
01:09:10.401 --> 01:09:11.420
<v Speaker 2>drunk driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went down,</v>

1398
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:15.080
<v Speaker 2>crime went down to record levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drunk driving when real estate went up,</v>

1399
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:16.423
<v Speaker 2>13 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Prescription overdoses down because </v>

1400
01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:20.324
<v Speaker 2>people are using marijuana for pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>control and tourism up hot girl moving </v>

1401
01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:25.593
<v Speaker 2>in part and time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's negatives to hippies freaks a </v>

1402
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:34.070
<v Speaker 2>lot of lazy bitches moving into lot of </v>

<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1437
01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.310
<v Speaker 2>That's like the majority of what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is.</v>

1438
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:11.143
<v Speaker 2>I just read about this documentary about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shift in pornography that like the </v>

1439
01:11:15.181 --> 01:11:16.014
<v Speaker 2>way that pornography's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that industry is kind of </v>

1440
01:11:18.451 --> 01:11:20.910
<v Speaker 2>disintegrating because of the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>toll free.</v>

1441
01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 2>One of the many fucking disrupt the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet is disrupting everything.</v>

1442
01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:25.134
<v Speaker 2>Man Isn't from Warren to taxi cabs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is getting reconfigured by </v>

1443
01:11:30.571 --> 01:11:31.860
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so fascinating.</v>

1444
01:11:31.890 --> 01:11:34.350
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very weird time.</v>

1445
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.030
<v Speaker 2>Not just taxi cabs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you,</v>

1446
01:11:36.031 --> 01:11:36.864
<v Speaker 2>rental cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the skirt rental car company to just </v>

1447
01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:39.743
<v Speaker 2>drop your rental car off and then they </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick it up later like they bring it to </v>

1448
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:43.884
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of like uber for rental cars so </v>

1449
01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:48.660
<v Speaker 2>they could just get a sofa in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be in Duncan's future,</v>

1450
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:52.243
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a pod.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought they should make cars </v>

1451
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:56.490
<v Speaker 2>with cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1452
01:11:56.491 --> 01:11:57.324
<v Speaker 2>and so you actually sit backwards in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and look at a screen that's </v>

1453
01:12:01.381 --> 01:12:02.214
<v Speaker 2>projected of what's in front of you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you drive backwards because you think </v>

1454
01:12:04.891 --> 01:12:06.380
<v Speaker 2>about if you're in a collision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1455
01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.760
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're driving backwards,</v>

1456
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:09.743
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucked if you're going to get </v>

1457
01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:12.660
<v Speaker 2>crushed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crushed,</v>

1458
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:15.450
<v Speaker 2>and it's not good to not know when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're impacting.</v>

1459
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would know as far as your.</v>

1460
01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:18.713
<v Speaker 2>It's like a virtual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as if you're looking out the </v>

1461
01:12:21.091 --> 01:12:21.924
<v Speaker 2>windshield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're actually shifted backwards </v>

1462
01:12:23.851 --> 01:12:26.280
<v Speaker 2>and it's cameras projecting on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen.</v>

1463
01:12:26.281 --> 01:12:28.960
<v Speaker 2>My brain hurts and probably throw up </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

1464
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.320
<v Speaker 2>That would be weird.</v>

1465
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:40.500
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like you wouldn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the car coming at you rear ending.</v>

1466
01:12:40.501 --> 01:12:43.330
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1467
01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.360

<v Speaker 2>research research center or something </v>

1476
01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:16.260

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:34.913
<v Speaker 1>there's a differentiation between death </v>
<v Speaker 1>metal and black metal and I always get </v>

1522
01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:37.854
<v Speaker 1>in trouble for mixing them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like he was like explaining to me </v>

1524
01:15:45.961 --> 01:15:46.794
<v Speaker 1>I get the whole story mixed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically it was explaining how </v>

1525
01:15:48.761 --> 01:15:49.594
<v Speaker 1>these guys are actually burning down </v>
<v Speaker 1>churches and they were really hard core </v>

1526
01:15:53.521 --> 01:15:55.920
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he plays this a burson,</v>

1527
01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.390
<v Speaker 1>this death metal for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1528
01:15:57.391 --> 01:15:58.530
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was super stoned.</v>

1529
01:15:58.531 --> 01:15:59.071
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1530
01:15:59.071 --> 01:16:01.080
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to what he's like.</v>

1531
01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel the pull?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1532
01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:05.370
<v Speaker 1>shit man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a little bit.</v>

01:16:05.371 --> 01:16:06.204
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got a weird dark little gravity to </v>

1534
01:16:08.551 --> 01:16:09.384
<v Speaker 1>it that if I'm allowed it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could see how I would start getting </v>

1535
01:16:11.761 --> 01:16:15.650
<v Speaker 1>more and more and more into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with these fucking phones,</v>

1537
01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.910

<v Speaker 5>magnetic,</v>

1538
01:16:19.911 --> 01:16:24.740
<v Speaker 5>subjective magnetism where you always </v>
<v Speaker 5>feel it's almost a physical feeling,</v>

<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's interactive.</v>

1542
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:34.280
<v Speaker 5>That's the big factor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The big factor.</v>

01:16:34.281 --> 01:16:35.810
<v Speaker 5>It's interactive.</v>

<v Speaker 5>not interacting.</v>

1551
01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:51.590
<v Speaker 5>It's like some bizarre introduction to a</v>
<v Speaker 5>new type of society.</v>

1552
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:52.910
<v Speaker 5>It's this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is.</v>

1553
01:16:52.911 --> 01:16:55.070
<v Speaker 5>These are the first steps,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these social media steps.</v>

1554
01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.113
<v Speaker 5>These are the first steps.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This new type of integrated </v>

1555
01:16:58.341 --> 01:17:00.390
<v Speaker 5>communication that we're experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1556
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:02.210
<v Speaker 5>but like we were talking about what the </v>
<v Speaker 5>city.</v>

1557
01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.193
<v Speaker 5>The city separates us from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>realization that we are just temporary </v>

1558
01:17:05.541 --> 01:17:06.374
<v Speaker 5>beings collecting things needlessly </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we're only gonna be for a short </v>

1559
01:17:09.531 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 5>amount of time,</v>

1560
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.903
<v Speaker 4>but yet we spend all of our focus trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to accumulate the largest pile of shit </v>

1561
01:17:14.391 --> 01:17:15.224
<v Speaker 4>before we die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's sort of the same thing is going </v>

1562
01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:21.140
<v Speaker 4>on with phones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same thing that's going on with</v>

1563
01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:21.974
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's solely that pulling us </v>

1564
01:17:23.451 --> 01:17:26.630
<v Speaker 4>into it's trance and the more we feed </v>
<v Speaker 4>into it,</v>

1565
01:17:26.631 --> 01:17:28.970
<v Speaker 4>the more we work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more they'll make more of these,</v>

1566
01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:30.620
<v Speaker 4>the more they'll make better ones of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these.</v>

1567
01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:31.454
<v Speaker 4>The more these things will deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper integrate themselves into your </v>

1568
01:17:33.891 --> 01:17:34.724
<v Speaker 4>life until the point where they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>symbiotic until the point where the new </v>

1569
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:39.050
<v Speaker 4>google contact lens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen that shit?</v>

<v Speaker 4>sugar if you're diabetic.</v>

<v Speaker 4>matter of time and it's a matter of time</v>

1579
01:18:16.161 --> 01:18:19.070
<v Speaker 4>before they create eyes that are better </v>
<v Speaker 4>than these eyes.</v>

01:18:52.890 --> 01:18:53.723
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was saying if you're always looking </v>

1595
01:18:55.041 --> 01:18:57.380
<v Speaker 4>at a certain distance in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>space,</v>

1596
01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 4>then that becomes like a cast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so if you put your arm in a cast and the</v>

1597
01:19:00.771 --> 01:19:01.604
<v Speaker 4>muscle atrophies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you are outside like a normal </v>

1598
01:19:03.801 --> 01:19:04.634
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you're looking at things that are </v>

1599
01:19:04.971 --> 01:19:05.804
<v Speaker 4>close,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at things that are far </v>

1600
01:19:06.231 --> 01:19:07.064
<v Speaker 4>away and it doesn't distort your lens </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're staring at a screen all the </v>

1601
01:19:10.731 --> 01:19:11.564
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I am all the time either doing a </v>

1602
01:19:13.221 --> 01:19:16.640
<v Speaker 4>podcast or going online or whatever that</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucks with your eyes.</v>

1603
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.190
<v Speaker 4>That's why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who would read all the time,</v>

1604
01:19:19.191 --> 01:19:21.800
<v Speaker 4>we'd get glasses and people would </v>
<v Speaker 4>correlate it like,</v>

1605
01:19:21.801 --> 01:19:24.350
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucked up his eyes from reading.</v>

1606
01:19:24.670 --> 01:19:26.280
<v Speaker 4>He would always say that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they said,</v>

1607
01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.111
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's bullshit,</v>

1608
01:19:27.111 --> 01:19:28.910
<v Speaker 4>but don't say I'm white or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

1609
01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.280
<v Speaker 4>If you read enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at that space,</v>

1610
01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.430
<v Speaker 4>has it right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Only something really close up,</v>

1611
01:19:34.431 --> 01:19:35.264
<v Speaker 4>but it fucks with your eyes yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also masturbation makes you go </v>

1612
01:19:38.931 --> 01:19:40.130
<v Speaker 4>blind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1613
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.970
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1614
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:41.840
<v Speaker 4>that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1615
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:42.410
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none.</v>

1616
01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:45.350
<v Speaker 4>If you use your left hand that you just </v>
<v Speaker 4>need balance.</v>

1617
01:19:45.420 --> 01:19:47.030
<v Speaker 4>It's all about balance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need,</v>

1618
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.680
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he bounced,</v>

1619
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 4>but this is this thing you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1620
01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:53.713
<v Speaker 4>aren't they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finding out that there's actually </v>

1621
01:19:55.131 --> 01:19:55.964
<v Speaker 4>something about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the energy being radiated from the </v>

1622
01:19:58.311 --> 01:19:59.144
<v Speaker 4>things at night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it fucks with your sleep cycle to </v>

1623
01:20:00.861 --> 01:20:01.694
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1624
01:20:01.700 --> 01:20:02.970
<v Speaker 4>the blue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the blue wavelengths.</v>

1625
01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:05.600
<v Speaker 4>So get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get f Dot Lux,</v>

1626
01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:07.100
<v Speaker 4>Lux.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

1627
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1628
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.970
<v Speaker 2>just interviewed a sleep scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1629
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:10.913
<v Speaker 2>two days ago in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really interesting guy does research at </v>

1630
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:14.934
<v Speaker 2>Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan Pardi and we were talking about </v>

1631
01:20:17.521 --> 01:20:18.181
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the,</v>

1632
01:20:18.181 --> 01:20:20.750
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blue end of the wavelength,</v>

1633
01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:21.713
<v Speaker 2>which is what you get from sunlight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>affects the centers of your brain that </v>

1634
01:20:24.751 --> 01:20:27.660
<v Speaker 2>Sorta tell you what time it is in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>circadian rhythm and all that.</v>

1635
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:32.990
<v Speaker 2>So as you get toward a evening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want the light to glow more and more</v>

1636
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:35.840
<v Speaker 2>gold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yellow and eliminate the blue.</v>

1637
01:20:35.841 --> 01:20:39.870
<v Speaker 2>So this app just automatically filters </v>
<v Speaker 2>your screen based upon where you are and</v>

1638
01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:41.930
<v Speaker 2>what time it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

1639
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:43.013
<v Speaker 2>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps with the sleep because if </v>

1640
01:20:44.071 --> 01:20:46.950
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at blue light right </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you go to bed,</v>

1641
01:20:46.951 --> 01:20:49.310
<v Speaker 2>your brain thinks you're in the midday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1642
01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:53.010
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So plain plane that they're doing,</v>

1643
01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:54.083
<v Speaker 2>they're creating this new plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to make it out of carbon </v>

1644
01:20:55.951 --> 01:21:00.480
<v Speaker 2>fiber and they're going to adjust the </v>
<v Speaker 2>light in the plane to match the light in</v>

1645
01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:04.740
<v Speaker 2>the area you're going so that your </v>
<v Speaker 2>circadian rhythms don't get interrupted.</v>

1646
01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:08.700
<v Speaker 2>No windows and apparently in doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another,</v>

1647
01:21:08.701 --> 01:21:09.534
<v Speaker 2>they're going to eliminate the type of </v>
<v Speaker 2>jet lag that a lot of people suffer </v>

1648
01:21:13.171 --> 01:21:14.004
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1649
01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:17.250
<v Speaker 2>because by the time you arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're already calibrated.</v>

1650
01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:18.413
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how the fuck they're doing </v>

1651
01:21:19.411 --> 01:21:20.940
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense to me.</v>

1652
01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I've 16 hour flights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1653
01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:24.223
<v Speaker 2>I've seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard about this new kind of a light </v>

1654
01:21:27.511 --> 01:21:28.344
<v Speaker 2>that they have that you can put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>basements that somehow perfectly </v>

1655
01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:34.530
<v Speaker 2>replicates sunlight so that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1656
01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing because you can grow weed.</v>

1657
01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:39.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not heard of those two.</v>

1658
01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:45.590
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get some places growing tomatoes.</v>

1659
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:50.480
<v Speaker 3>Fucking go down Ventura Boulevard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's like 15 different stores selling</v>

1660
01:21:50.481 --> 01:21:54.270
<v Speaker 3>you indoor tomato growing supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>

1661
01:21:54.390 --> 01:21:57.890
<v Speaker 3>I just think that's what it was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

1662
01:21:57.891 --> 01:21:59.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of indoor farmer's.</v>

1663
01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Another heirloom specialists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1664
01:22:02.301 --> 01:22:07.220
<v Speaker 3>did you hear about the a former FBI </v>
<v Speaker 3>agents whose house got broken down?</v>

1665
01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.970
<v Speaker 3>They broke down the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cea,</v>

1666
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:11.690
<v Speaker 3>a dea agents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they shot their dog.</v>

1667
01:22:11.691 --> 01:22:13.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that they loved sheepdogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>

1668
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:14.203
<v Speaker 3>It's in the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrested them and then found out that </v>

1669
01:22:16.611 --> 01:22:20.210
<v Speaker 3>they were just really grown tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They literally were growing tomatoes,</v>

1670
01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:26.120
<v Speaker 3>so these people were for agents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These guys were retired agents to try to</v>

1671
01:22:26.121 --> 01:22:28.040
<v Speaker 3>grow some vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a nice salad.</v>

1672
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:30.980
<v Speaker 3>They got a fucking gun to their bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>Karma.</v>

1673
01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:35.000
<v Speaker 3>Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Karma in that at least if not Karma.</v>

1674
01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:35.953
<v Speaker 3>There's a recognition of the system that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you participated in for most of your </v>

1675
01:22:38.181 --> 01:22:40.130
<v Speaker 3>adult life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's your career.</v>

1676
01:22:40.250 --> 01:22:41.083
<v Speaker 3>Here's what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Fed this machine and machine that's </v>

1677
01:22:42.321 --> 01:22:45.200
<v Speaker 3>looking for too much electricity and </v>
<v Speaker 3>using your basement,</v>

1678
01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.660
<v Speaker 3>which could be indicative of plant </v>
<v Speaker 3>growth.</v>

1679
01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Plant growth in your house while you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucker.</v>

1680
01:22:50.541 --> 01:22:54.620
<v Speaker 3>You're probably a criminal time to kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>your door in with guns,</v>

1681
01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.590
<v Speaker 3>but dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talk about this all the time,</v>

1682
01:22:57.591 --> 01:23:02.591
<v Speaker 3>but if you really let yourself accept </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fact that right now at this moment,</v>

1683
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:06.090
<v Speaker 3>flying over neighborhoods or high</v>

1684
01:23:06.090 --> 01:23:06.923
<v Speaker 5>tech helicopters scanning the third,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the radiation from the houses to find </v>

1685
01:23:13.841 --> 01:23:18.841
<v Speaker 5>out if inside their growing plants that </v>
<v Speaker 5>aren't accepted by the state.</v>

1686
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:22.360
<v Speaker 5>That's really weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's why I'm leaving.</v>

1687
01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm going back to Spain where they don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>do that shit.</v>

1688
01:23:24.430 --> 01:23:26.530
<v Speaker 5>They don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't do Portland neither though,</v>

1689
01:23:26.531 --> 01:23:27.790
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You say Portland.</v>

1690
01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:30.860
<v Speaker 5>Don't have the resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go to Eugene.</v>

1691
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:33.640
<v Speaker 5>I could definitely not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's nice.</v>

1692
01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:37.320
<v Speaker 5>But you've seen the new um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>radar that they have now would,</v>

1693
01:23:37.321 --> 01:23:40.750
<v Speaker 5>they can hook deepened or x Ray?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They look deep into your house.</v>

1694
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:43.280
<v Speaker 5>They can look in your house and see or </v>
<v Speaker 5>silhouettes as you.</v>

1695
01:23:43.300 --> 01:23:46.900
<v Speaker 5>So you can watch people fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they could look through this screen</v>

1696
01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:50.680
<v Speaker 5>and literally see you inside your house </v>
<v Speaker 5>blinds drawn,</v>

1697
01:23:50.890 --> 01:23:53.560
<v Speaker 5>banging your wife on the bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But who wants to see two skeletons?</v>

1698
01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:54.450
<v Speaker 5>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really,</v>

1699
01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.270
<v Speaker 5>really love it.</v>

1700
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:56.890
<v Speaker 5>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's just.</v>

1701
01:23:56.891 --> 01:23:57.724
<v Speaker 5>I think it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think you could see images like you </v>

1702
01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:02.080
<v Speaker 5>could see the outside of the body as </v>
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>

1703
01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:04.910
<v Speaker 5>It's not just as simple as like you see </v>
<v Speaker 5>the scallops actually,</v>

1704
01:24:04.930 --> 01:24:05.763
<v Speaker 5>you'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure they'll figure out a way that </v>

1705
01:24:06.810 --> 01:24:07.643
<v Speaker 5>to interpolate whatever data they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>gathering and turn it into something </v>

1706
01:24:10.391 --> 01:24:11.224
<v Speaker 5>that isn't shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just a matter of time and it's a </v>

1707
01:24:12.671 --> 01:24:13.504
<v Speaker 5>matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Any technology that is being controlled </v>

1708
01:24:16.241 --> 01:24:18.170
<v Speaker 5>by the state,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1709
01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:19.053
<v Speaker 5>because it's too expensive for normal </v>
<v Speaker 5>people to obtain eventually more than </v>

1710
01:24:22.691 --> 01:24:26.920
<v Speaker 5>likely will become less and less </v>
<v Speaker 5>expensive and everyone will have it.</v>

1711
01:24:26.921 --> 01:24:27.754
<v Speaker 5>So if right now there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some insane technology that people are </v>

1712
01:24:31.061 --> 01:24:33.010
<v Speaker 5>using to look through walls and see </v>
<v Speaker 5>shadows,</v>

1713
01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:34.480
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then it's at what,</v>

1714
01:24:34.481 --> 01:24:35.314
<v Speaker 5>10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>15 years before it's going to be </v>

1715
01:24:36.641 --> 01:24:37.474
<v Speaker 5>something that you could just order or </v>
<v Speaker 5>something that you can download on your </v>

1716
01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.713
<v Speaker 5>super sophisticated drones for Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 5>is using mobile x Ray Vance to spy on </v>

1717
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:47.550
<v Speaker 5>unknown targets.</v>

1718
01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:52.730
<v Speaker 5>Patrol was a friend of mine used to work</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the company who makes those.</v>

1719
01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.793
<v Speaker 5>And what they were doing was they were </v>
<v Speaker 5>scanning container ships coming in and </v>

1720
01:24:56.561 --> 01:24:57.394
<v Speaker 5>out of the country are coming into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country so they could look for drugs </v>

1721
01:24:59.891 --> 01:25:02.320
<v Speaker 5>without opening up the containers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look what this says.</v>

1722
01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:03.253
<v Speaker 5>Stop right there for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 5>New York City won't reveal how often </v>

1723
01:25:05.741 --> 01:25:08.020
<v Speaker 5>cops bombard places,</v>
<v Speaker 5>vehicles,</v>

1724
01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:08.854
<v Speaker 5>or people with radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>or if there are health risks for </v>

1725
01:25:11.321 --> 01:25:13.210
<v Speaker 5>residents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they won't reveal it.</v>

1726
01:25:13.450 --> 01:25:14.283
<v Speaker 5>If you don't talk about the technology </v>
<v Speaker 5>was used in Afghanistan before and b </v>

1727
01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:17.913
<v Speaker 5>being loosed on us streets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Each x Ray van cost an estimated </v>

1728
01:25:21.071 --> 01:25:25.270
<v Speaker 5>$729,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>to $825,000.</v>

1729
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:26.104
<v Speaker 5>It's a big fucking difference.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will not talk about anything at all </v>

1730
01:25:28.331 --> 01:25:32.530
<v Speaker 5>about this New York police commissioner.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bill Bratton until you paid for it.</v>

1731
01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:33.393
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How's that going to the range of </v>

1732
01:25:34.931 --> 01:25:39.550
<v Speaker 5>security and counterterrorism activity </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we engage in added.</v>

1733
01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:41.620
<v Speaker 5>They're not used to scan people for </v>
<v Speaker 5>weapon,</v>

1734
01:25:41.650 --> 01:25:42.483
<v Speaker 5>but you know what's hilarious?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They've used the terrorists acts like </v>

1735
01:25:45.011 --> 01:25:48.550
<v Speaker 5>various terrorist acts all across the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world to catch people selling drugs.</v>

1736
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:53.790
<v Speaker 5>Because you could sell drugs as an act </v>
<v Speaker 5>of terror that falls under financing.</v>

1737
01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:57.550
<v Speaker 5>They pay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just pass some new Patriot Act,</v>

1738
01:25:57.551 --> 01:26:01.870
<v Speaker 5>you know that right now the new Patriot </v>
<v Speaker 5>Act that was quietly,</v>

1739
01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.290
<v Speaker 5>secretly past.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that the CIA,</v>

1740
01:26:04.290 --> 01:26:06.980
<v Speaker 2>NSA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>

1741
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.320
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Obama said I'm going to watch star</v>

1742
01:26:10.321 --> 01:26:12.750
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he apparently just sign this demonic</v>

1743
01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.640
<v Speaker 1>thing and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1744
01:26:14.641 --> 01:26:15.480
<v Speaker 1>it's scary.</v>

1745
01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:16.820
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1746
01:26:17.230 --> 01:26:18.063
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of leeway now for what </v>

1747
01:26:20.491 --> 01:26:24.720
<v Speaker 2>they can and can't spy on you for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they decide to look into your life for.</v>

1748
01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:25.763
<v Speaker 2>So let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we follow up what you were saying </v>

1749
01:26:27.481 --> 01:26:29.670
<v Speaker 2>about how something controlled by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>

1750
01:26:29.820 --> 01:26:30.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets miniaturized and cheaper and </v>

1751
01:26:32.221 --> 01:26:35.400
<v Speaker 2>eventually becomes available to everyone</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we apply that.</v>

1752
01:26:35.401 --> 01:26:37.830
<v Speaker 2>Same thing to weaponry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been thinking about this for a long</v>

1753
01:26:37.831 --> 01:26:40.260
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nukes are getting smaller and smaller.</v>

1754
01:26:40.261 --> 01:26:42.400
<v Speaker 2>They've got suitcase nukes now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John.</v>

1755
01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much more convenient.</v>

1756
01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:46.220
<v Speaker 2>It's so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1757
01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:49.160
<v Speaker 2>But pack nuke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of suitcases.</v>

1758
01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.003
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So are we going to come to the point </v>

1759
01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.340
<v Speaker 2>where any terrorist group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so called terrorist group,</v>

1760
01:26:56.341 --> 01:27:00.000
<v Speaker 2>and I use that word in air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can have access to these things.</v>

1761
01:27:00.001 --> 01:27:02.520
<v Speaker 2>What's that going to mean to world </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics?</v>

1762
01:27:02.521 --> 01:27:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to come to a point?</v>

1763
01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like everyone in Switzerland has</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

1764
01:27:06.450 --> 01:27:08.790
<v Speaker 2>You know that this philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if everyone had guns,</v>

1765
01:27:08.791 --> 01:27:11.020
<v Speaker 2>everyone would show out and be nice to </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

1766
01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.393
<v Speaker 2>Are we going to come to that point </v>
<v Speaker 2>internationally where if people are </v>

1767
01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.064
<v Speaker 2>aggrieved enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can really fuck up the game and so </v>

1768
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:24.900
<v Speaker 2>then the attention will shift to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>having people so aggrieved because right</v>

1769
01:27:24.901 --> 01:27:26.120
<v Speaker 2>now we don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1770
01:27:26.121 --> 01:27:27.380
<v Speaker 2>We'll go blow them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're.</v>

1771
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:29.610
<v Speaker 2>If they're that pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to come for us,</v>

1772
01:27:29.611 --> 01:27:31.110
<v Speaker 2>then we'll send drones and kill them </v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1773
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:34.560
<v Speaker 2>but if they could come for us with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>speedboat and nukes,</v>

1774
01:27:35.370 --> 01:27:36.203
<v Speaker 2>is that a game changer or do you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing just shifts to another </v>

1775
01:27:38.221 --> 01:27:42.030
<v Speaker 2>level and us have to address the root of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem?</v>

1776
01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:42.893
<v Speaker 2>If it was that accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's like the ultimate statement of </v>

1777
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:50.240
<v Speaker 2>an armed society is a polite society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:52.620
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like the ultimate expression</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that,</v>

1779
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:56.400
<v Speaker 2>like in a well armed nuclear society has</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking super polite.</v>

1780
01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:57.893
<v Speaker 2>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>knock on your neighbor's door and tell </v>

1781
01:27:58.681 --> 01:28:01.550
<v Speaker 2>him his dogs barking too loud when he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing a fucking nuke vest.</v>

1782
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:05.670
<v Speaker 2>Flow up the way you saying my dog is </v>
<v Speaker 2>making too much noise.</v>

1783
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:06.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it man.</v>

1784
01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:08.360
<v Speaker 2>I want to take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you want the dog?</v>

1785
01:28:08.361 --> 01:28:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hit this button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just do this.</v>

1786
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:12.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to wipe out the whole block.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Man.</v>

1787
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:13.740
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're talking about.</v>

1788
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1789
01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:14.773
<v Speaker 1>I did an interview up a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't interview at Singularity </v>

1790
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.791
<v Speaker 1>University in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any,</v>

1791
01:28:18.791 --> 01:28:22.470
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brought up this exact thing any,</v>

1792
01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:25.210
<v Speaker 1>any and and which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1793
01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:26.063
<v Speaker 1>he was explaining it in terms of bio </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons that people are creating these </v>

1794
01:28:31.841 --> 01:28:34.910
<v Speaker 1>like apparently are like fucking around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with genes in their,</v>

1795
01:28:35.250 --> 01:28:37.080
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their garages.</v>

1796
01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.333
<v Speaker 1>And then you were saying like things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the ability to launch satellites </v>

1797
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:44.880
<v Speaker 1>and just about anything you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's what he said,</v>

1798
01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:46.860
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he may have,</v>

1799
01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:47.461
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1800
01:28:47.461 --> 01:28:48.294
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say he was exaggerating when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you said we're looking at if technology </v>

1801
01:28:51.121 --> 01:28:51.954
<v Speaker 1>continues to accelerate as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at a point in human </v>

1802
01:28:55.381 --> 01:28:58.680
<v Speaker 1>history where anybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they wanted to,</v>

1803
01:28:59.230 --> 01:29:03.360
<v Speaker 1>could destroy the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are caused massive damage.</v>

1804
01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:05.270
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1805
01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:06.780
<v Speaker 1>you think to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1806
01:29:06.781 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's imagine that that was the case.</v>

1807
01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:09.983
<v Speaker 1>And somehow by some miracle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every government of the world suddenly </v>

1808
01:29:13.441 --> 01:29:16.620
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to address everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal issues.</v>

1809
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:17.783
<v Speaker 1>There was still going to be one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely a thousand people who are </v>

1810
01:29:21.901 --> 01:29:22.734
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1811
01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:23.633
<v Speaker 1>that's cool man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think I'm going to detonate this </v>

1812
01:29:25.801 --> 01:29:29.400
<v Speaker 1>nuclear bomb that I created in my three </v>
<v Speaker 1>d printer,</v>

1813
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:31.890
<v Speaker 1>getting from fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows how.</v>

1814
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:32.813
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big question mark or something </v>

1815
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.790
<v Speaker 1>even worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this thing,</v>

1816
01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.620
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is the,</v>

1817
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:40.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that awful race,</v>

1818
01:29:40.021 --> 01:29:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna talks about that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1819
01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:43.313
<v Speaker 1>which is that here we have this race </v>
<v Speaker 1>between absolute destruction and some </v>

1820
01:29:47.731 --> 01:29:51.870
<v Speaker 1>kind of via tech technology that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even exist yet.</v>

1821
01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And some kind of Utopian awakening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this kind of stuff probably makes</v>

1822
01:29:57.181 --> 01:30:00.470
<v Speaker 1>you want to punch me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want hug you.</v>

1823
01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.610
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1824
01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:03.613
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1825
01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:04.740
<v Speaker 1>but these are these two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1826
01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:07.830
<v Speaker 1>these are these two races that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening right now.</v>

1827
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:08.663
<v Speaker 1>One of them is without question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology is going to get to the point </v>

1828
01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:18.930
<v Speaker 1>where every single human has access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of device,</v>

1829
01:30:18.990 --> 01:30:22.320
<v Speaker 1>more powerful than any other human in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past ever had access to.</v>

1830
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:24.143
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that gonna happen before some other </v>

1831
01:30:29.731 --> 01:30:30.564
<v Speaker 1>form of technology emerges that makes us</v>
<v Speaker 1>all unifying to one organism or some </v>

1832
01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:36.600
<v Speaker 1>beautiful thing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1833
01:30:36.601 --> 01:30:40.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrifying relay race man.</v>

1834
01:30:40.381 --> 01:30:41.410
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a tear.</v>

1835
01:30:41.411 --> 01:30:43.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrifying race.</v>

1836
01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that kind of always,</v>

1837
01:30:45.451 --> 01:30:45.540
<v Speaker 1>always</v>

1838
01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:46.373
<v Speaker 4>the case?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we need some sort of a problem to </v>

1839
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:50.190
<v Speaker 4>overcome it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need competition.</v>

1840
01:30:50.191 --> 01:30:52.410
<v Speaker 4>We need the Yin and the Yang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need a dark and a light.</v>

1841
01:30:52.411 --> 01:30:53.890
<v Speaker 4>We need the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1842
01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:56.220
<v Speaker 4>we need to tide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We need like a cycle.</v>

1843
01:30:56.530 --> 01:31:00.450
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like we need this resistance</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like us building towards this,</v>

1844
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:01.583
<v Speaker 4>this technological singularity almost.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be in your fucking iphone </v>

1845
01:31:06.070 --> 01:31:08.780
<v Speaker 4>and everyone's going to have the ability</v>
<v Speaker 4>and well,</v>

1846
01:31:08.890 --> 01:31:11.550
<v Speaker 4>we have to fix humanity in order to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>this happen.</v>

1847
01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 4>The only way that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>survive,</v>

1848
01:31:13.410 --> 01:31:16.320
<v Speaker 4>we fixed humanity and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I've been thinking,</v>

1849
01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.660
<v Speaker 4>it's just something I'd never talked to </v>
<v Speaker 4>him economists about this,</v>

1850
01:31:18.661 --> 01:31:22.320
<v Speaker 4>but in my own stupid head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1851
01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:23.243
<v Speaker 4>I think we're going to run into a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bottleneck with technology and I think </v>

1852
01:31:26.401 --> 01:31:30.870
<v Speaker 4>one of the big bottlenecks is technology</v>
<v Speaker 4>is all about access to information,</v>

1853
01:31:30.871 --> 01:31:31.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1854
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:33.180
<v Speaker 4>Technology like as far as what's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

1855
01:31:33.181 --> 01:31:35.940
<v Speaker 4>it's like your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ability to do things,</v>

1856
01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:37.043
<v Speaker 4>whether it's to project images on </v>
<v Speaker 4>screens or to download things faster or </v>

1857
01:31:40.861 --> 01:31:41.694
<v Speaker 4>to number crunch cruncher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the various different things that </v>

1858
01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:47.490
<v Speaker 4>technology can do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what we're using,</v>

1859
01:31:47.491 --> 01:31:48.324
<v Speaker 4>the way we're using it today was a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>factor is the ability to exchange </v>

1860
01:31:52.201 --> 01:31:53.034
<v Speaker 4>information and the access to </v>
<v Speaker 4>information and the access to each </v>

1861
01:31:54.901 --> 01:31:55.734
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it seems like it's getting closer </v>

1862
01:31:56.761 --> 01:31:57.810
<v Speaker 4>and closer and closer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1863
01:31:57.811 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 4>Access is getting quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more information,</v>

1864
01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:00.953
<v Speaker 4>it's easier to get to the boundaries </v>
<v Speaker 4>between people are getting smaller and </v>

1865
01:32:02.921 --> 01:32:04.240
<v Speaker 4>smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the bottleneck?</v>

1866
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:07.900
<v Speaker 4>Bottleneck is going to be money and </v>
<v Speaker 4>money is ones and Zeros.</v>

1867
01:32:07.930 --> 01:32:09.280
<v Speaker 4>That's what money is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Money,</v>

1868
01:32:09.281 --> 01:32:10.114
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If of all,</v>

1869
01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:14.740
<v Speaker 4>ultimately all information becomes </v>
<v Speaker 4>available to all people at all times.</v>

1870
01:32:14.741 --> 01:32:16.170
<v Speaker 4>That's ultimate enlightenment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1871
01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:18.940
<v Speaker 4>Instantaneous information constantly </v>
<v Speaker 4>available to everyone.</v>

1872
01:32:19.300 --> 01:32:20.133
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't money information now because </v>

1873
01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:23.550
<v Speaker 4>money's not sacks or old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not talking about,</v>

1874
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:24.423
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got.</v>

1875
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:28.070
<v Speaker 4>I've got 15 bushels or gold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of you got when you know?</v>

1876
01:32:28.071 --> 01:32:28.904
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about some weird ones and </v>

1877
01:32:29.891 --> 01:32:34.891
<v Speaker 4>Zeros and plastic that makes these ones </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Zeros transfer your magnetic strip.</v>

1878
01:32:35.621 --> 01:32:36.454
<v Speaker 4>You slide on the machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You Punch in your numbers is not real </v>

1879
01:32:39.791 --> 01:32:43.840
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's information and in transferring our</v>

1880
01:32:43.841 --> 01:32:47.740
<v Speaker 4>money to inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bottleneck is going to be money.</v>

1881
01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.440
<v Speaker 4>We're going to come to this ultimate </v>
<v Speaker 4>point where we realized,</v>

1882
01:32:50.441 --> 01:32:52.120
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can't protect money anymore.</v>

1883
01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.340
<v Speaker 4>We can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't say this has duncan's money.</v>

1884
01:32:54.341 --> 01:32:56.610
<v Speaker 4>This is Christmas money because it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to be just mine.</v>

1885
01:32:57.210 --> 01:32:58.043
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be just money and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe there'll be some sort of a merit </v>

1886
01:33:01.271 --> 01:33:02.104
<v Speaker 4>based system where you can have access </v>
<v Speaker 4>to money or use money and we'll have to </v>

1887
01:33:07.091 --> 01:33:07.924
<v Speaker 4>figure out some sort of a way around it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it'll have to be some sort of like </v>

1888
01:33:10.090 --> 01:33:11.770
<v Speaker 4>ethical thing that we all agree on.</v>

1889
01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:15.190
<v Speaker 4>If I'm looking at it correctly and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at all of this,</v>

1890
01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.660
<v Speaker 4>these trends that lead to quicker and </v>
<v Speaker 4>quicker access to information,</v>

1891
01:33:19.870 --> 01:33:22.150
<v Speaker 4>more and more availability of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>information,</v>

1892
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:24.670
<v Speaker 4>access to information becoming </v>
<v Speaker 4>universal.</v>

1893
01:33:24.850 --> 01:33:25.541
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the money?</v>

1894
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:26.920
<v Speaker 4>Money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Money is information.</v>

1895
01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:28.300
<v Speaker 4>It's ones and Zeros.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all it is.</v>

1896
01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:29.473
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how are you going to stop it if that's </v>

1897
01:33:29.981 --> 01:33:33.400
<v Speaker 4>the trend of the trend ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 4>becomes instantaneous.</v>

1898
01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:37.630
<v Speaker 4>Constant access to all information for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody knows secrets.</v>

1899
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:39.520
<v Speaker 4>None exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't exist.</v>

1900
01:33:39.521 --> 01:33:41.040
<v Speaker 4>I could read your email.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can read mine.</v>

1901
01:33:41.290 --> 01:33:42.700
<v Speaker 4>We're all communicating with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

1902
01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:45.280
<v Speaker 4>There's no more secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How does money fit in there?</v>

1903
01:33:45.730 --> 01:33:46.563
<v Speaker 4>Unless we go back to fucking collecting </v>
<v Speaker 4>clam shells and putting them on strings </v>

1904
01:33:49.181 --> 01:33:50.790
<v Speaker 4>and this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is my company,</v>

1905
01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:53.190
<v Speaker 4>not so I have a mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm used to it.</v>

1906
01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:54.850
<v Speaker 4>We're going to have silver coins and </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

1907
01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:56.130
<v Speaker 5>What are we going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>

1908
01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:59.450
<v Speaker 5>But I would question the premise that </v>
<v Speaker 5>money ever was real.</v>

1909
01:34:00.450 --> 01:34:03.210
<v Speaker 5>You seem to be saying that we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>reaching a point where it will no longer</v>

1910
01:34:03.211 --> 01:34:06.960
<v Speaker 5>be real like bushels of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just symbolic too.</v>

1911
01:34:07.050 --> 01:34:07.883
<v Speaker 5>I don't think money ever was anything </v>
<v Speaker 5>more than agreement between people that </v>

1912
01:34:11.191 --> 01:34:13.110
<v Speaker 5>we're all going to pretend this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's true,</v>

1913
01:34:13.111 --> 01:34:14.910
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it it locally.</v>

1914
01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:17.130
<v Speaker 5>Your money is different than someone in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Greece.</v>

1915
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:19.360
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you mean you go with your money there.</v>

1916
01:34:19.380 --> 01:34:21.540
<v Speaker 5>There's some sort of exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to make an agreement.</v>

1917
01:34:21.541 --> 01:34:23.220
<v Speaker 5>Do you accept my money will accept your </v>
<v Speaker 5>money,</v>

1918
01:34:23.221 --> 01:34:25.590
<v Speaker 5>but it's not really worth a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much is it worth over here?</v>

1919
01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:27.700
<v Speaker 5>Seventy five cents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God dammit,</v>

1920
01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:31.140
<v Speaker 5>but last month it was a dollar 25.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well Times have changed.</v>

1921
01:34:31.141 --> 01:34:34.200
<v Speaker 5>We don't like your money as much anymore</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they make deals.</v>

1922
01:34:34.290 --> 01:34:37.830
<v Speaker 5>Our central bank who's staffed by people</v>
<v Speaker 5>we don't know.</v>

1923
01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:39.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of mystery at the heart of</v>

1924
01:34:39.721 --> 01:34:42.840
<v Speaker 5>it is to be able to go to Canada and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was Canada and it was awesome.</v>

1925
01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.040
<v Speaker 5>We do Montreal and you'd get like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollar 50 for a dollar,</v>

1926
01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:48.500
<v Speaker 5>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was amazing.</v>

1927
01:34:48.501 --> 01:34:51.080
<v Speaker 5>Like food would be cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything will be cheaper.</v>

1928
01:34:51.090 --> 01:34:51.471
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

1929
01:34:51.471 --> 01:34:52.304
<v Speaker 5>your money goes a long way in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then it shifted and then the </v>

1930
01:34:54.541 --> 01:34:57.150
<v Speaker 5>Canadians would come to America because </v>
<v Speaker 5>the money would go a long way here.</v>

1931
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:58.310
<v Speaker 5>Money was worth more than ours.</v>

1932
01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:00.600
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of Grant Morrison?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1933
01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you know Graham?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should have them on the show,</v>

1934
01:35:02.101 --> 01:35:04.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just refresh my memory.</v>

1935
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Grant Morrison is that he writes a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of incredible comic books.</v>

1936
01:35:08.131 --> 01:35:11.190
<v Speaker 1>One of them I'm super into right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graphic novels called the,</v>

1937
01:35:11.191 --> 01:35:12.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the invisibles,</v>

1938
01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:14.100
<v Speaker 1>but he's really smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1939
01:35:14.190 --> 01:35:17.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a grant morrison lecture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a descent.</v>

1940
01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:21.940
<v Speaker 1>He was like at a disinfecting gathering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he gives this really cool lecture or</v>

1941
01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:22.793
<v Speaker 1>a talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he said is that </v>

1942
01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:25.463
<v Speaker 1>the super elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have gone back to a barter economy </v>

1943
01:35:28.650 --> 01:35:29.483
<v Speaker 1>because money doesn't mean anything to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you if you have billions and billions </v>

1944
01:35:32.670 --> 01:35:33.503
<v Speaker 1>and billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the normal way to get someone to do </v>

1945
01:35:34.861 --> 01:35:35.850
<v Speaker 1>something is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1946
01:35:35.851 --> 01:35:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you x dollars for you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing.</v>

1947
01:35:39.210 --> 01:35:43.650
<v Speaker 1>But if you've got infinite money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone asks you to do something to give</v>

1948
01:35:43.651 --> 01:35:46.380
<v Speaker 1>you more money to add to your infinite </v>
<v Speaker 1>pool of money,</v>

1949
01:35:46.620 --> 01:35:47.940
<v Speaker 1>it's not an incentive anymore.</v>

1950
01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:50.610
<v Speaker 1>You're not incentivized by money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's more like,</v>

1951
01:35:50.611 --> 01:35:53.130
<v Speaker 1>what can you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me what it's like a,</v>

1952
01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:55.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to some kind of weird,</v>

1953
01:35:55.141 --> 01:35:59.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're going to barter power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're going to barter some access</v>

1954
01:35:59.521 --> 01:36:00.354
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but money is irrelevant to the super </v>

1955
01:36:02.501 --> 01:36:05.430
<v Speaker 1>elite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Money only means something to people who</v>

1956
01:36:05.431 --> 01:36:08.840
<v Speaker 1>are in the lower and middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you have an infinite amount of this</v>

1957
01:36:08.841 --> 01:36:09.674
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's completely an absolutely </v>

1958
01:36:11.401 --> 01:36:12.810
<v Speaker 1>irrelevant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're saying.</v>

1959
01:36:13.020 --> 01:36:13.853
<v Speaker 1>Everything then theoretically would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back to some weird barter economy </v>

1960
01:36:17.150 --> 01:36:17.520
<v Speaker 1>where</v>

1961
01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.353
<v Speaker 5>would never going to reach a point of </v>
<v Speaker 5>ultimate resources where everyone has </v>

1962
01:36:20.701 --> 01:36:21.534
<v Speaker 5>the same access to things at the super </v>
<v Speaker 5>elite does because there's just not </v>

1963
01:36:23.671 --> 01:36:24.460
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>

1964
01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:25.293
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where you get into like this is </v>

1965
01:36:26.381 --> 01:36:30.850
<v Speaker 1>where you get into the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced generation.</v>

1966
01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:33.970
<v Speaker 1>You know like if we get to like Google </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing,</v>

1967
01:36:33.971 --> 01:36:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about Google contact </v>
<v Speaker 1>lenses,</v>

1968
01:36:35.801 --> 01:36:40.801
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to stop at the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology is doing the thing to us that</v>

1969
01:36:41.290 --> 01:36:46.070
<v Speaker 1>the fucking face suckers on aliens do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started off far away.</v>

1970
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:50.580
<v Speaker 1>It was our phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was our computers than it like a.</v>

1971
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It was on our desks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a nice safe distance.</v>

1972
01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Then it got into our pockets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It tried to climb onto our face with the</v>

1973
01:36:58.121 --> 01:37:00.190
<v Speaker 1>google glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody liked that.</v>

1974
01:37:00.340 --> 01:37:03.940
<v Speaker 1>But now it's getting into our eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna stop at our eyes.</v>

1975
01:37:03.941 --> 01:37:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Technology's gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>merge with our consciousness and when it</v>

1976
01:37:06.730 --> 01:37:07.563
<v Speaker 1>merges with our consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory would be that it could </v>

1977
01:37:09.401 --> 01:37:13.780
<v Speaker 1>somehow create experiences that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from reality,</v>

1978
01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:16.720
<v Speaker 1>which means that really what's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference?</v>

1979
01:37:16.721 --> 01:37:18.970
<v Speaker 1>There is no more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't like.</v>

1980
01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:19.893
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're already using bionic parts on </v>

1981
01:37:21.281 --> 01:37:22.130
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1982
01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hips,</v>

1983
01:37:24.020 --> 01:37:25.250
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1984
01:37:25.251 --> 01:37:28.190
<v Speaker 5>All sorts of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My wife has ocular implants.</v>

1985
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:32.090
<v Speaker 5>She has lenses surgically implanted in </v>
<v Speaker 5>her eyes.</v>

1986
01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:32.930
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is.</v>

1987
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:34.370
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not new stuff.</v>

1988
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:35.263
<v Speaker 5>They're doing artificial knees.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're doing artificial hips and how </v>

1989
01:37:38.661 --> 01:37:41.990
<v Speaker 5>long is it gonna be before someone comes</v>
<v Speaker 5>along and says,</v>

1990
01:37:41.991 --> 01:37:42.780
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dumped.</v>

1991
01:37:42.780 --> 01:37:45.650
<v Speaker 5>You have two choices.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can either wear glasses,</v>

1992
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:46.603
<v Speaker 5>you have 2,400</v>
<v Speaker 5>vision and you know we have classes for </v>

1993
01:37:48.261 --> 01:37:48.570
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Didn't.</v>

1994
01:37:48.570 --> 01:37:51.800
<v Speaker 5>That's fine if you enjoy it or is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>really simple procedure.</v>

1995
01:37:51.801 --> 01:37:52.634
<v Speaker 5>Takes five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were placed your eyeball with an </v>

1996
01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 5>artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't feel any</v>

1997
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:58.890
<v Speaker 6>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you'll have to put up with ads every</v>

1998
01:37:58.891 --> 01:38:00.060
<v Speaker 6>60 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1999
01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.640
<v Speaker 6>you can click that ad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can click the ad.</v>

2000
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:05.580
<v Speaker 6>You just reach up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've touched.</v>

2001
01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:07.873
<v Speaker 6>This is what.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the name of that that thought </v>

2002
01:38:09.991 --> 01:38:12.540
<v Speaker 6>experiment about the ship?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Somebody ship,</v>

2003
01:38:12.780 --> 01:38:13.980
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the one where it's like,</v>

2004
01:38:13.981 --> 01:38:14.814
<v Speaker 6>it's like the idea is like at a sailor </v>
<v Speaker 6>is sailing across the ocean and the </v>

2005
01:38:19.711 --> 01:38:20.544
<v Speaker 6>mast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he needs to replace the mast until we </v>

2006
01:38:22.081 --> 01:38:24.640
<v Speaker 6>replaced the mast and then he replaces,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember his name.</v>

2007
01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.630
<v Speaker 6>The different shifts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>different by the time it gets there,</v>

2008
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:29.760
<v Speaker 6>it's all new parts,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's still his ship.</v>

2009
01:38:29.761 --> 01:38:31.920
<v Speaker 6>So it's like with the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with technology,</v>

2010
01:38:32.190 --> 01:38:33.023
<v Speaker 6>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like what if we keep replacing our </v>

2011
01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:36.810
<v Speaker 6>spirit is the ship of theseus.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

2012
01:38:36.811 --> 01:38:38.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

2013
01:38:38.581 --> 01:38:40.170
<v Speaker 6>the idea is like when is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when do we,</v>

2014
01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:41.183
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

2015
01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:44.110
<v Speaker 6>what is humanity or when do we stop </v>
<v Speaker 6>being human?</v>

2016
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:46.350
<v Speaker 6>The whole idea about downloading </v>
<v Speaker 6>consciousness,</v>

2017
01:38:46.351 --> 01:38:47.184
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Way To put consciousness into a </v>

2018
01:38:48.661 --> 01:38:50.700
<v Speaker 6>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And how do you know when you've done it?</v>

2019
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.680
<v Speaker 6>Like how do you know what consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 6>is?</v>

2020
01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:53.533
<v Speaker 6>I mean his consciousness inexorably </v>
<v Speaker 6>attached to your physical being or is </v>

2021
01:38:57.511 --> 01:38:59.880
<v Speaker 6>consciousness something that's out there</v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're just,</v>

2022
01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:00.870
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

2023
01:39:00.870 --> 01:39:03.810
<v Speaker 6>you're consciousness is riding around </v>
<v Speaker 6>this meat wagon.</v>

2024
01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.520
<v Speaker 6>Is that what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't.</v>

2025
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:07.470
<v Speaker 6>There's no agreement on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Also,</v>

2026
01:39:07.471 --> 01:39:12.120
<v Speaker 6>we need to define what we mean by human </v>
<v Speaker 6>because I would argue that we've already</v>

2027
01:39:12.121 --> 01:39:15.600
<v Speaker 6>left human experience and we're already </v>
<v Speaker 6>well into something else.</v>

2028
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:18.330
<v Speaker 6>What would you call it that we're into?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2029
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:21.830
<v Speaker 6>I equate it to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You might know this,</v>

2030
01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.920
<v Speaker 6>that every locust starts off as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>grasshopper.</v>

2031
01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:28.750
<v Speaker 6>And what happens is there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2032
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:30.070
<v Speaker 6>particular,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2033
01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:30.953
<v Speaker 6>the best example is in North Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's this species of grasshopper that </v>

2034
01:39:35.730 --> 01:39:39.060
<v Speaker 6>when the density of the population </v>
<v Speaker 6>density gets tight,</v>

2035
01:39:39.061 --> 01:39:39.894
<v Speaker 6>sufficiently tight,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a trigger point and different </v>

2036
01:39:42.541 --> 01:39:44.940
<v Speaker 6>genes are triggered and activated in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2037
01:39:44.941 --> 01:39:47.500
<v Speaker 6>in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the preexisting gene.</v>

2038
01:39:47.500 --> 01:39:50.640
<v Speaker 6>So it's the same DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it changes the shape of the head,</v>

2039
01:39:50.641 --> 01:39:52.770
<v Speaker 6>changes the legs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>changes the coloration,</v>

2040
01:39:52.771 --> 01:39:53.604
<v Speaker 6>and changes the behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's when they become locusts </v>

2041
01:39:55.650 --> 01:39:56.483
<v Speaker 6>swarm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so I think that humans are like the </v>

2042
01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:01.013
<v Speaker 6>grasshopper locusts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that with agriculture we </v>

2043
01:40:03.181 --> 01:40:04.014
<v Speaker 6>became locus and started swarming and </v>
<v Speaker 6>we're willing to swarm behavior at this </v>

2044
01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:09.810
<v Speaker 6>point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so for the sake of argument,</v>

2045
01:40:09.811 --> 01:40:10.644
<v Speaker 6>I would say human,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way I would define it is hunter </v>

2046
01:40:14.131 --> 01:40:14.964
<v Speaker 6>gatherer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is 95 plus percent of our time on </v>

2047
01:40:17.341 --> 01:40:18.174
<v Speaker 6>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's human behavior and what we are </v>

2048
01:40:20.281 --> 01:40:25.281
<v Speaker 6>now is shifted into this other,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could say artificial.</v>

2049
01:40:25.381 --> 01:40:26.214
<v Speaker 6>You could just say emergent behavior </v>
<v Speaker 6>pattern that conflicts with our </v>

2050
01:40:30.601 --> 01:40:32.160
<v Speaker 6>grasshopper illness.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2051
01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:35.340
<v Speaker 6>And that we're suffering from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what this latest book is about.</v>

2052
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:37.820
<v Speaker 6>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2053
01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:38.833
<v Speaker 6>I would say we're no longer human.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like we're a bunch of poodles </v>

2054
01:40:41.581 --> 01:40:43.440
<v Speaker 6>talking about when we stopped being </v>
<v Speaker 6>wolves,</v>

2055
01:40:43.441 --> 01:40:44.400
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you this,</v>

2056
01:40:44.401 --> 01:40:48.630
<v Speaker 6>if I was a fucking locust and there was </v>
<v Speaker 6>a grasshopper that's like,</v>

2057
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:51.870
<v Speaker 6>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>awesome,</v>

2058
01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.250
<v Speaker 6>because I can fly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm flying,</v>

2059
01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.710
<v Speaker 5>I've evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is our major disagreement.</v>

2060
01:40:56.711 --> 01:40:58.210
<v Speaker 5>Years.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to be a grasshopper.</v>

2061
01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:00.310
<v Speaker 5>I'm cool with being a locus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but.</v>

2062
01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:04.960
<v Speaker 5>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's an interesting thing,</v>

2063
01:41:04.961 --> 01:41:05.450
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2064
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:06.283
<v Speaker 5>what I think you're saying is there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>more inherent biological happiness into </v>

2065
01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:12.460
<v Speaker 5>remaining of grasshopper or remaining of</v>
<v Speaker 5>human right?</v>

2066
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:13.383
<v Speaker 5>That's why the things that make that </v>
<v Speaker 5>resonate most deeply with us are the </v>

2067
01:41:16.931 --> 01:41:21.340
<v Speaker 5>things that reflect the culture alive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hunting for example,</v>

2068
01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:24.670
<v Speaker 5>you're not having trouble focusing your </v>
<v Speaker 5>mind when you're hunting.</v>

2069
01:41:24.810 --> 01:41:29.810
<v Speaker 5>You don't think there's your tapping and</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you ever caught a nice fish,</v>

2070
01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:30.813
<v Speaker 5>you've got fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that feeling when you catch a </v>

2071
01:41:32.351 --> 01:41:34.090
<v Speaker 5>nice fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a like a feeling.</v>

2072
01:41:35.050 --> 01:41:35.883
<v Speaker 5>There's a primal reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying a nice fish because it's </v>

2073
01:41:39.191 --> 01:41:42.040
<v Speaker 5>easier for people to accept because it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cold blooded animal.</v>

2074
01:41:42.150 --> 01:41:45.370
<v Speaker 5>Like something about like saying there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>something about when you get a nice deer</v>

2075
01:41:45.371 --> 01:41:46.990
<v Speaker 5>in your sites and you're ready to end </v>
<v Speaker 5>its life.</v>

2076
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:48.280
<v Speaker 5>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

2077
01:41:48.670 --> 01:41:52.390
<v Speaker 5>right when I'm about to eat a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you say a fish.</v>

2078
01:41:52.391 --> 01:41:52.720
<v Speaker 5>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2079
01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:54.460
<v Speaker 5>he caught a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They eat other fish,</v>

2080
01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:57.340
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just for whatever reason,</v>

2081
01:41:57.341 --> 01:41:59.770
<v Speaker 5>people don't care if you catch a fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they don't give a fuck.</v>

2082
01:41:59.830 --> 01:42:00.710
<v Speaker 5>We,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

2083
01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:01.733
<v Speaker 5>we differentiate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have more value in warm blooded </v>

2084
01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:07.540
<v Speaker 5>animals than we put in in fish for </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2085
01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:10.030
<v Speaker 5>Fucking you can't scream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2086
01:42:10.031 --> 01:42:13.190
<v Speaker 5>I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what is Mitch Hedberg,</v>

2087
01:42:13.191 --> 01:42:14.024
<v Speaker 5>it's got that great joke like thank God </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fish can't scream because the ocean </v>

2088
01:42:17.081 --> 01:42:22.081
<v Speaker 5>would be the scariest Jackie each other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>

2089
01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:24.013
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there is something about their </v>

2090
01:42:25.361 --> 01:42:27.580
<v Speaker 5>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Listening is that many people,</v>

2091
01:42:27.581 --> 01:42:29.170
<v Speaker 5>I think they don't take care of their </v>
<v Speaker 5>young.</v>

2092
01:42:29.230 --> 01:42:31.390
<v Speaker 5>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this woman said that to me,</v>

2093
01:42:31.391 --> 01:42:32.224
<v Speaker 5>one of the reasons why she eats fish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she doesn't eat chicken or any other </v>

2094
01:42:34.330 --> 01:42:35.050
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

2095
01:42:35.050 --> 01:42:35.681
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why?</v>

2096
01:42:35.681 --> 01:42:36.221
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2097
01:42:36.221 --> 01:42:38.020
<v Speaker 5>the fish don't take care of their young.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2098
01:42:38.021 --> 01:42:38.860
<v Speaker 5>damn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's gangster.</v>

2099
01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:41.580
<v Speaker 5>She drew the line in the sand and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>eat each other.</v>

2100
01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:42.913
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're cannibals like almost </v>

2101
01:42:43.691 --> 01:42:44.650
<v Speaker 5>exclusively.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2102
01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:48.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean almost a universally like trout.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the best ways to catch trout as a</v>

2103
01:42:48.621 --> 01:42:50.860
<v Speaker 5>little baby trout floors that looked </v>
<v Speaker 5>like a trail.</v>

2104
01:42:51.190 --> 01:42:52.023
<v Speaker 5>Large mouth bass,</v>
<v Speaker 5>large mouth bass lowers occasionally </v>

2105
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:55.870
<v Speaker 5>catch them with those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2106
01:42:55.871 --> 01:42:56.704
<v Speaker 5>they don't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just here to eat whatever they </v>

2107
01:42:58.421 --> 01:42:59.254
<v Speaker 5>can eat done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it's innately inherently meaningful </v>

2108
01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:05.770
<v Speaker 5>is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2109
01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:06.613
<v Speaker 5>And the reason it's inherently </v>
<v Speaker 5>meaningful is because that's the animal </v>

2110
01:43:08.801 --> 01:43:09.634
<v Speaker 5>that we evolved to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And now we live in this society that's </v>

2111
01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.233
<v Speaker 5>distracting us from that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Trying to sell it back and little </v>

2112
01:43:14.711 --> 01:43:15.544
<v Speaker 5>pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe you can afford a hunting weekend </v>

2113
01:43:16.961 --> 01:43:19.210
<v Speaker 5>in Utah at this ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2114
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:20.103
<v Speaker 5>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the hell was the point of losing </v>

2115
01:43:24.041 --> 01:43:26.530
<v Speaker 5>the humanity?</v>
<v Speaker 5>When do we stop being human?</v>

2116
01:43:26.531 --> 01:43:27.364
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we already have and I think </v>

2117
01:43:28.181 --> 01:43:29.014
<v Speaker 5>that's the major fucking ailment of our </v>
<v Speaker 5>time as far is a part of it and I </v>

2118
01:43:34.451 --> 01:43:35.284
<v Speaker 5>certainly think there's a series of </v>
<v Speaker 5>reward systems in our bodies that are </v>

2119
01:43:37.781 --> 01:43:41.080
<v Speaker 5>not getting checked off like they used </v>
<v Speaker 5>to like rewards,</v>

2120
01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:43.390
<v Speaker 5>like fear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>overcoming fear,</v>

2121
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:46.420
<v Speaker 5>difficulty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>physical exertion,</v>

2122
01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:49.030
<v Speaker 5>all these different things that people </v>
<v Speaker 5>did and then the,</v>

2123
01:43:49.031 --> 01:43:50.680
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the thing of seeing the fish,</v>

2124
01:43:50.900 --> 01:43:52.050
<v Speaker 5>catching the fish oil.</v>

2125
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:56.600
<v Speaker 4>There's this visceral genetic response </v>
<v Speaker 4>to getting a fish like you got it.</v>

2126
01:43:56.601 --> 01:43:59.000
<v Speaker 4>Now you're going to eat and that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your friends are going to.</v>

2127
01:43:59.001 --> 01:44:01.760
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and when you pull a big fish like ah,</v>

2128
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:04.280
<v Speaker 4>there's this weird feeling where </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>

2129
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:06.970
<v Speaker 4>you get a little charge like we were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were.</v>

2130
01:44:07.010 --> 01:44:09.830
<v Speaker 4>We had a successful gathering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got something,</v>

2131
01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:11.053
<v Speaker 4>now we can eat and that's any built in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's built into your system and it </v>

2132
01:44:14.181 --> 01:44:15.014
<v Speaker 4>doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you go to the supermarket and you </v>

2133
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:16.814
<v Speaker 4>pick up that salmon steak that's already</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Saran wrap and it's already got the </v>

2134
01:44:19.671 --> 01:44:22.700
<v Speaker 4>little styrofoam bottom that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel a damn thing.</v>

2135
01:44:22.701 --> 01:44:25.010
<v Speaker 4>You don't feel anything but eat the same</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of nutrients.</v>

2136
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:27.710
<v Speaker 4>It's very strange what we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've done,</v>

2137
01:44:27.711 --> 01:44:28.544
<v Speaker 4>we've completely removed all the natural</v>
<v Speaker 4>elements while needing those natural </v>

2138
01:44:32.031 --> 01:44:32.864
<v Speaker 4>elements at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we removed any connection that we </v>

2139
01:44:35.931 --> 01:44:40.010
<v Speaker 4>have to like we're eating this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris has brought this amazing ham.</v>

2140
01:44:40.011 --> 01:44:41.150
<v Speaker 4>What does this stuff called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again?</v>

2141
01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:43.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm on Google.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's delicious.</v>

2142
01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.560
<v Speaker 4>And explain it because it's a really </v>
<v Speaker 4>cool way they,</v>

2143
01:44:45.561 --> 01:44:46.200
<v Speaker 4>they make it</v>

2144
01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:46.920
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's this,</v>

2145
01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:47.753
<v Speaker 6>it's made from pigs that are the same </v>
<v Speaker 6>race of pigs that the Romans brought to </v>

2146
01:44:51.001 --> 01:44:54.180
<v Speaker 6>Spain originally 2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There.</v>

2147
01:44:54.181 --> 01:44:56.340
<v Speaker 6>It's called Pata Negra,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which means black foot.</v>

2148
01:44:56.520 --> 01:44:59.170
<v Speaker 6>And this is so in Spanish Ham.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a,</v>

2149
01:44:59.171 --> 01:45:02.490
<v Speaker 6>there are different gradations and this </v>
<v Speaker 6>is the highest gradation.</v>

2150
01:45:02.970 --> 01:45:05.400
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all they do is eat acorns.</v>

2151
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:08.700
<v Speaker 6>They live out in these big open fields.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Beautiful.</v>

2152
01:45:08.701 --> 01:45:09.534
<v Speaker 6>I've driven through there and the extra </v>
<v Speaker 6>my daughter on my motorcycle and then </v>

2153
01:45:12.901 --> 01:45:14.700
<v Speaker 6>they're cured.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not cooked at all.</v>

2154
01:45:14.701 --> 01:45:16.890
<v Speaker 6>It's not smoked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's cured with salt.</v>

2155
01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:20.550
<v Speaker 6>Lots of salt and then hung up and </v>
<v Speaker 6>certain temperature.</v>

2156
01:45:20.551 --> 01:45:23.010
<v Speaker 6>And how long is it good for?</v>
<v Speaker 6>How long does it sit for?</v>

2157
01:45:23.230 --> 01:45:24.063
<v Speaker 6>Forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Forever.</v>

2158
01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:25.700
<v Speaker 6>And you can buy these.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2159
01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:26.573
<v Speaker 6>I would love to bring you one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I don't think they let them in the </v>

2160
01:45:28.351 --> 01:45:29.910
<v Speaker 6>country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you buy the whole leg.</v>

2161
01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:31.140
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like a whole ham.</v>

2162
01:45:31.141 --> 01:45:32.010
<v Speaker 6>It's cured.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2163
01:45:32.011 --> 01:45:35.010
<v Speaker 6>And in most Spanish houses they'll have </v>
<v Speaker 6>a ham and it'll be there.</v>

2164
01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.073
<v Speaker 6>And so they've got this holder and you </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a long knife and you slice it </v>

2165
01:45:39.331 --> 01:45:41.010
<v Speaker 6>really thin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it just doesn't go</v>

2166
01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.000
<v Speaker 4>bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2167
01:45:42.001 --> 01:45:42.834
<v Speaker 4>because it's cured.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible that you could have a </v>

2168
01:45:44.251 --> 01:45:45.830
<v Speaker 4>whole ham leg sitting out</v>

2169
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.450
<v Speaker 6>all the way inside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2170
01:45:47.480 --> 01:45:48.860
<v Speaker 6>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you put a,</v>

2171
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:51.560
<v Speaker 6>you put a towel over it or something so </v>
<v Speaker 6>that flies,</v>

2172
01:45:51.561 --> 01:45:52.760
<v Speaker 6>don't get on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's it,</v>

2173
01:45:52.761 --> 01:45:53.594
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it can be there and it's a </v>

2174
01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:57.320
<v Speaker 6>traditional thing around Christmas to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2175
01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:00.860
<v Speaker 6>give a gift of a ham and a in it'll </v>
<v Speaker 6>last,</v>

2176
01:46:00.861 --> 01:46:01.311
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>five,</v>

2177
01:46:01.311 --> 01:46:03.020
<v Speaker 6>six months,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever till they're done eating it.</v>

2178
01:46:03.110 --> 01:46:04.430
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2179
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:07.330
<v Speaker 4>So my point being that this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this meat is in front of us.</v>

2180
01:46:07.331 --> 01:46:08.164
<v Speaker 4>It's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was from an animal that wasn't even </v>

2181
01:46:09.601 --> 01:46:13.240
<v Speaker 4>the live on this continent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone killed it in Spain.</v>

2182
01:46:13.241 --> 01:46:14.770
<v Speaker 4>Did all this stuff to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brought it over here,</v>

2183
01:46:14.771 --> 01:46:15.604
<v Speaker 4>we're eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have zero connection to any of those </v>

2184
01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:19.540
<v Speaker 4>activities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to have.</v>

2185
01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:21.790
<v Speaker 4>We just eating it and it's delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're loving it,</v>

2186
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:26.260
<v Speaker 4>but it's all on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not as much as if we'd raise the pig and</v>

2187
01:46:26.261 --> 01:46:28.570
<v Speaker 4>been involved in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2188
01:46:28.571 --> 01:46:30.550
<v Speaker 4>I cooked a ham.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I smoked a ham.</v>

2189
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:31.843
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done one for about six months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the last one I did was an animal </v>

2190
01:46:34.811 --> 01:46:39.811
<v Speaker 4>that I shot and I smoked it in my brined</v>
<v Speaker 4>it for six days and then I smoked.</v>

2191
01:46:40.111 --> 01:46:42.310
<v Speaker 4>It was like this big project that I did </v>
<v Speaker 4>and yeah,</v>

2192
01:46:42.311 --> 01:46:44.980
<v Speaker 4>it was a way different sort of a feeling</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're eating and it's like,</v>

2193
01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:46.053
<v Speaker 4>like I have a leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a peg leg of a full ham on the </v>

2194
01:46:48.671 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 4>bone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's about that</v>

2195
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:50.873
<v Speaker 5>big that's sitting in my freezer that </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm eventually going to Brian sometime </v>

2196
01:46:53.611 --> 01:46:54.444
<v Speaker 5>soon and I'll stick that sucker in this </v>
<v Speaker 5>w like water with garlic and salt and </v>

2197
01:46:59.941 --> 01:47:00.774
<v Speaker 5>brown sugar and it sits in there for </v>
<v Speaker 5>about six days and then I smoke it at </v>

2198
01:47:04.300 --> 01:47:07.410
<v Speaker 5>like 250 degrees for hours and hours </v>
<v Speaker 5>until.</v>

2199
01:47:07.411 --> 01:47:09.390
<v Speaker 5>It's just as juicy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>delicious,</v>

2200
01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:13.200
<v Speaker 5>and a 140 degrees in the center.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you know all the parasites,</v>

2201
01:47:13.201 --> 01:47:15.330
<v Speaker 5>potential parasites are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>

2202
01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:16.110
<v Speaker 5>So good.</v>

2203
01:47:16.110 --> 01:47:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I got a big green egg and I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2204
01:47:18.930 --> 01:47:22.770
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some weird peace that comes over</v>

2205
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:23.910
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's agreement?</v>

2206
01:47:23.950 --> 01:47:27.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really cool grill man.</v>

2207
01:47:27.241 --> 01:47:29.470
<v Speaker 1>And it's a fire grill so you've got to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2208
01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.473
<v Speaker 1>So there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a gas grill so you have to </v>

2209
01:47:32.461 --> 01:47:33.294
<v Speaker 1>adjust the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these wonderful dials you </v>

2210
01:47:35.431 --> 01:47:36.840
<v Speaker 1>have to adjust to get the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2211
01:47:36.841 --> 01:47:37.674
<v Speaker 1>But yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're sitting over an open </v>

2212
01:47:39.781 --> 01:47:43.660
<v Speaker 1>fire cooking if feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know what you mean and I.</v>

2213
01:47:43.710 --> 01:47:45.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2214
01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like this thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

2215
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:52.610
<v Speaker 1>I missed this feeling like this feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>this feels as good as when I jump into a</v>

2216
01:47:52.741 --> 01:47:55.330
<v Speaker 1>swimming pool or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like elemental and so on.</v>

2217
01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:56.213
<v Speaker 5>Or like a nutrient your body needs that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not getting and then you eat it </v>

2218
01:47:58.891 --> 01:48:00.230
<v Speaker 5>and your body's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Please,</v>

2219
01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.380
<v Speaker 5>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Give me more.</v>

2220
01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:02.313
<v Speaker 5>It's also this link.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's moments that people throughout </v>

2221
01:48:04.681 --> 01:48:05.514
<v Speaker 5>history have had success hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then eating that meal over a campfire </v>

2222
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:12.900
<v Speaker 5>and when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is the most rewarding of all fires,</v>

2223
01:48:13.090 --> 01:48:13.923
<v Speaker 5>like I've eaten meat that we shot like </v>
<v Speaker 5>hours before from a deer on a campfire </v>

2224
01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:22.020
<v Speaker 5>in the middle of Montana and it was one </v>
<v Speaker 5>of the greatest nights of my life.</v>

2225
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:24.640
<v Speaker 5>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Me and Bryan County,</v>

2226
01:48:24.650 --> 01:48:26.880
<v Speaker 5>Steve Right now and my friend Ryan </v>
<v Speaker 5>Callahan,</v>

2227
01:48:26.881 --> 01:48:27.714
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of other friends were on this </v>
<v Speaker 5>show and when we were sitting around </v>

2228
01:48:30.121 --> 01:48:31.170
<v Speaker 5>this fire eating,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2229
01:48:31.410 --> 01:48:34.890
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>More enjoyable meal because there's fire</v>

2230
01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:35.724
<v Speaker 5>and there's an animal that was just </v>
<v Speaker 5>killed and we're cooking it and </v>

2231
01:48:37.501 --> 01:48:38.430
<v Speaker 5>preparing it together.</v>

2232
01:48:38.610 --> 01:48:41.760
<v Speaker 5>There's all this camaraderie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's the successful hunt aspect of it</v>

2233
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.863
<v Speaker 5>and then there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this primal satisfaction that you get </v>

2234
01:48:45.061 --> 01:48:48.930
<v Speaker 5>from watching meat cook over fire and </v>
<v Speaker 5>the warmth of the.</v>

2235
01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:50.670
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how cold it was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very cold.</v>

2236
01:48:50.671 --> 01:48:51.504
<v Speaker 5>There's a sense of accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like we're comfortable because we're </v>

2237
01:48:53.671 --> 01:48:54.504
<v Speaker 5>smart and other something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love sleeping in a tent when it's </v>

2238
01:48:56.821 --> 01:48:58.590
<v Speaker 5>raining and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2239
01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:03.620
<v Speaker 5>like arm's length from me is miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cold drizzle and I'm warm.</v>

2240
01:49:04.261 --> 01:49:06.920
<v Speaker 5>I got my candle and turn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got my doobies.</v>

2241
01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:10.150
<v Speaker 5>I'm like completely happy here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love the sense of,</v>

2242
01:49:10.151 --> 01:49:10.240
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2243
01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:12.640
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment that that's another great</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling.</v>

2244
01:49:12.641 --> 01:49:14.410
<v Speaker 1>The feeling of rain when you're safe</v>

2245
01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:17.570
<v Speaker 5>side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're sleeping in a van even though you</v>

2246
01:49:17.571 --> 01:49:18.830
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just to the sound.</v>

2247
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:20.083
<v Speaker 5>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think this is the key to human </v>

2248
01:49:21.831 --> 01:49:23.720
<v Speaker 5>happiness that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we're ignoring,</v>

2249
01:49:23.721 --> 01:49:28.721
<v Speaker 5>that our society takes all these things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that were free and daily reality for our</v>

2250
01:49:29.241 --> 01:49:30.074
<v Speaker 5>ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Takes them away and sells back cheap </v>

2251
01:49:33.231 --> 01:49:37.100
<v Speaker 5>copies along with antidepressants and </v>
<v Speaker 5>antianxiety meds.</v>

2252
01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:37.993
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that that summation of where we </v>

2253
01:49:40.221 --> 01:49:42.890
<v Speaker 5>are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you think that it's possible that we,</v>

2254
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:45.950
<v Speaker 5>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are no longer human,</v>

2255
01:49:46.090 --> 01:49:48.340
<v Speaker 5>were becoming a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this is a drawn</v>

2256
01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:52.320
<v Speaker 1>out process and we're just caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wake of it domestic.</v>

2257
01:49:52.330 --> 01:49:54.160
<v Speaker 1>We're in the process of being </v>
<v Speaker 1>domesticated.</v>

2258
01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2259
01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2260
01:49:55.751 --> 01:49:56.584
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think when you look at like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extreme progressive left movement </v>

2261
01:50:00.881 --> 01:50:01.714
<v Speaker 1>that are just like so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so focused on like using the correct </v>

2262
01:50:07.061 --> 01:50:09.850
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns do not offend,</v>

2263
01:50:09.851 --> 01:50:10.684
<v Speaker 1>don't use this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about with this </v>

2264
01:50:11.531 --> 01:50:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Harvard placemat that they're handing </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

2265
01:50:14.170 --> 01:50:17.800
<v Speaker 1>This is like an uber domestic </v>
<v Speaker 1>domestication thing.</v>

2266
01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:21.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's almost like domestication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at the veteran,</v>

2267
01:50:22.090 --> 01:50:22.923
<v Speaker 1>the American male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean talk about getting your balls </v>

2268
01:50:26.111 --> 01:50:30.460
<v Speaker 1>snipped man in the last 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become offensive to even be a man.</v>

2269
01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:34.510
<v Speaker 1>It's become offensive to express a </v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness with masculinity,</v>

2270
01:50:34.540 --> 01:50:36.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to be able to be a straight.</v>

2271
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.863
<v Speaker 1>You can't be a term for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you look at what the </v>

2272
01:50:43.331 --> 01:50:44.164
<v Speaker 1>real problem as it seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people have mistaken language with </v>

2273
01:50:48.791 --> 01:50:49.624
<v Speaker 1>intention.</v>

2274
01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:54.430
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the problem is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that words,</v>

2275
01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain words.</v>

2276
01:50:56.590 --> 01:50:57.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

2277
01:50:57.370 --> 01:50:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I've had it happen on twitter where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

2278
01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:00.333
<v Speaker 1>I think I did a podcast with a opry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he said the female perspective and so </v>

2279
01:51:04.831 --> 01:51:05.664
<v Speaker 1>someone on twitter gets into an argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me over how that you shouldn't say </v>

2280
01:51:09.371 --> 01:51:11.800
<v Speaker 1>female perspective because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

2281
01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:12.790
<v Speaker 1>I always saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

2282
01:51:12.850 --> 01:51:13.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know about the female perspective </v>

2283
01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:18.880
<v Speaker 1>because I see from it a lot because </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of me I've got like a lot of.</v>

2284
01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a feminine side of me that,</v>

2285
01:51:21.330 --> 01:51:22.690
<v Speaker 1>so I know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the,</v>

2286
01:51:23.050 --> 01:51:23.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2287
01:51:23.890 --> 01:51:26.980
<v Speaker 1>Carl young was telling you about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anima and the animus that,</v>

2288
01:51:26.981 --> 01:51:30.460
<v Speaker 1>that there's a masculine and a feminine </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of everybody that they're just in</v>

2289
01:51:30.461 --> 01:51:31.181
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me,</v>

2290
01:51:31.181 --> 01:51:33.100
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're growing,</v>

2291
01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.113
<v Speaker 1>you're free of it.</v>

2292
01:51:34.130 --> 01:51:34.590
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2293
01:51:34.590 --> 01:51:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but just pay for yourself bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's that.</v>

2294
01:51:36.790 --> 01:51:37.623
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2295
01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.170
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2296
01:51:38.170 --> 01:51:39.003
<v Speaker 1>when people get caught up in the symbol </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus what the symbol is representing </v>

2297
01:51:43.820 --> 01:51:46.900
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and completely ignore the fact like,</v>

2298
01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:49.180
<v Speaker 1>think of how many different forms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck there are,</v>

2299
01:51:49.181 --> 01:51:52.570
<v Speaker 1>like the term fuck or how many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of the word Shit there are.</v>

2300
01:51:52.780 --> 01:51:54.740
<v Speaker 1>And all of them are intention based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2301
01:51:54.741 --> 01:51:56.080
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say,</v>

2302
01:51:56.081 --> 01:51:58.180
<v Speaker 1>if I say there's so many ways I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>say fuck you to you.</v>

2303
01:51:58.300 --> 01:51:59.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you man.</v>

2304
01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I could be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2305
01:52:01.241 --> 01:52:02.074
<v Speaker 1>fuck you man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's two different fuck use or you </v>

2306
01:52:05.171 --> 01:52:07.330
<v Speaker 1>could do something awesome and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2307
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:08.640
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2308
01:52:08.860 --> 01:52:10.720
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That works too.</v>

2309
01:52:10.730 --> 01:52:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Or exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like,</v>

2310
01:52:12.371 --> 01:52:12.970
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

2311
01:52:12.970 --> 01:52:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you joe.</v>

2312
01:52:15.230 --> 01:52:20.230
<v Speaker 1>But the point is there's like every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single one of these has behind it and an</v>

2313
01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:21.934
<v Speaker 1>energy that has been encapsulated into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sound and that energy is all that </v>

2314
01:52:26.531 --> 01:52:27.364
<v Speaker 1>matters to me and the fact that everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been caught up in the sound itself </v>

2315
01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:33.520
<v Speaker 1>and forgotten the fact that the energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it is all that matters.</v>

2316
01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:35.950
<v Speaker 1>That's where things are getting fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

2317
01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:36.873
<v Speaker 1>Exactly what we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier when we were talking about </v>

2318
01:52:38.261 --> 01:52:41.200
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly on drugs,</v>

2319
01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:42.373
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about why people are </v>

2320
01:52:43.511 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 1>addicted to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about the emptiness</v>

2321
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:46.813
<v Speaker 3>of their lives that leads them into </v>
<v Speaker 3>those heroin and prescription drugs and </v>

2322
01:52:49.731 --> 01:52:51.530
<v Speaker 3>all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also terrorism.</v>

2323
01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:54.140
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about bombs going off and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people getting killed.</v>

2324
01:52:54.141 --> 01:52:54.974
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why someone's life is so empty that you </v>

2325
01:52:57.291 --> 01:52:59.270
<v Speaker 3>put on a suicide vest in the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2326
01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:00.493
<v Speaker 3>We're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking at the surface of things </v>

2327
01:53:02.421 --> 01:53:04.730
<v Speaker 3>and we're not interested in what's going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on behind.</v>

2328
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:05.743
<v Speaker 3>I was watching Fox News the other day </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was some woman who was on on </v>

2329
01:53:09.291 --> 01:53:10.124
<v Speaker 3>and she was doing like one of those open</v>
<v Speaker 3>letter to the president things and she </v>

2330
01:53:12.621 --> 01:53:13.790
<v Speaker 3>was doing it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox News,</v>

2331
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.820
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she was saying that this country was</v>

2332
01:53:16.821 --> 01:53:17.654
<v Speaker 3>founded on Judeo Christian values and </v>
<v Speaker 3>she was going to this thing about </v>

2333
01:53:22.130 --> 01:53:25.940
<v Speaker 3>responding and Obama's response to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>terror attacks in Paris.</v>

2334
01:53:26.150 --> 01:53:28.190
<v Speaker 3>Not sufficiently burrowing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2335
01:53:28.210 --> 01:53:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

2336
01:53:28.750 --> 01:53:33.750
<v Speaker 3>not sufficiently aggressive or didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>make her feel comfortable on top of it.</v>

2337
01:53:35.630 --> 01:53:36.463
<v Speaker 3>Your job is to keep me safe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just really an opportunity for </v>

2338
01:53:40.011 --> 01:53:43.620
<v Speaker 3>her to step up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and proclaim,</v>

2339
01:53:43.621 --> 01:53:44.454
<v Speaker 3>claim her ideology to be the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology and this other ideology that's </v>

2340
01:53:48.351 --> 01:53:50.260
<v Speaker 3>killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2341
01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:51.133
<v Speaker 3>Is representatives of this ideology that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the enemy of this United States </v>

2342
01:53:55.940 --> 01:53:57.680
<v Speaker 3>of America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was founded by my call.</v>

2343
01:53:57.710 --> 01:53:57.920
<v Speaker 3>That's</v>

2344
01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.910
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

2345
01:53:58.911 --> 01:54:00.380
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

2346
01:54:00.580 --> 01:54:01.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you.</v>

2347
01:54:01.341 --> 01:54:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You realized that like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that?</v>

2348
01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:06.440
<v Speaker 1>There is a kind of war that's raging </v>
<v Speaker 1>around this planet,</v>

2349
01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a war against people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

2350
01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:10.693
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intent on expressing anger into the </v>

2351
01:54:13.521 --> 01:54:14.354
<v Speaker 1>world and 10 on expressing power over </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people into the world and people </v>

2352
01:54:19.101 --> 01:54:21.230
<v Speaker 1>who are thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there might be another way.</v>

2353
01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:22.273
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there was a way that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>readapt or maybe there are evolved to </v>

2354
01:54:26.151 --> 01:54:31.151
<v Speaker 1>fit into this society or maybe there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole new way where we don't have to try</v>

2355
01:54:31.251 --> 01:54:34.490
<v Speaker 1>to constantly punch back at a person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>has punched us.</v>

2356
01:54:34.670 --> 01:54:35.503
<v Speaker 1>That's the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a war between when you get </v>

2357
01:54:37.641 --> 01:54:38.474
<v Speaker 1>fucking hit on the interstate when your </v>
<v Speaker 1>nice car gets hit because some asshole </v>

2358
01:54:42.471 --> 01:54:43.304
<v Speaker 1>isn't paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you get out and scream at him or do </v>

2359
01:54:45.651 --> 01:54:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you ask him if he's okay and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole group of people who think,</v>

2360
01:54:48.921 --> 01:54:51.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck that motherfucker up.</v>

2361
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:52.183
<v Speaker 1>You teach them a lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them understand if he's not paying </v>

2362
01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:56.690
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gonna get fucked up.</v>

2363
01:54:56.840 --> 01:55:00.550
<v Speaker 1>You become the hand of God and the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

2364
01:55:00.551 --> 01:55:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing vengeance as much as you can.</v>

2365
01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:03.613
<v Speaker 1>Or the other version of it is you try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome that desire and you become a </v>

2366
01:55:08.031 --> 01:55:11.690
<v Speaker 1>servant of some concept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that the most important thing.</v>

2367
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Even if we've lost everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2368
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:16.280
<v Speaker 1>even if we become locust and that's all </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone and you know,</v>

2369
01:55:16.281 --> 01:55:17.390
<v Speaker 1>the more you talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2370
01:55:17.391 --> 01:55:20.360
<v Speaker 1>the more I do know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earlier I was like,</v>

2371
01:55:20.361 --> 01:55:21.141
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my low kids,</v>

2372
01:55:21.141 --> 01:55:21.974
<v Speaker 1>but I do hear what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very sweet and actually </v>

2373
01:55:23.781 --> 01:55:26.690
<v Speaker 1>kind of tragic and sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if this is the case,</v>

2374
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:31.930
<v Speaker 1>then we still have to figure out a way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like even now as much as possible put</v>

2375
01:55:33.141 --> 01:55:37.190
<v Speaker 1>out into the world love and it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter what language we're using,</v>

2376
01:55:37.191 --> 01:55:40.250
<v Speaker 1>if love is behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the highest thing.</v>

2377
01:55:40.251 --> 01:55:41.084
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all that matters is like </v>

2378
01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>that meal was good because</v>

2379
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:44.843
<v Speaker 3>you were with people you love.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you are sitting after that hunt with </v>

2380
01:55:47.281 --> 01:55:49.980
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of people that you disliked or </v>
<v Speaker 3>assholes,</v>

2381
01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:52.830
<v Speaker 3>I bet it wouldn't have been as delicious</v>
<v Speaker 3>as of a meal.</v>

2382
01:55:52.890 --> 01:55:53.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but here's the problem with that </v>

2383
01:55:54.001 --> 01:55:55.320
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't have been as good.</v>

2384
01:55:55.321 --> 01:55:56.154
<v Speaker 3>We had several meals behind the campfire</v>
<v Speaker 3>where we didn't kill anything there </v>

2385
01:55:59.021 --> 01:55:59.854
<v Speaker 3>wasn't as good,</v>

2386
01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.060
<v Speaker 6>but.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And also you're in a love.</v>

2387
01:56:02.590 --> 01:56:06.570
<v Speaker 6>You're a love supporting environment </v>
<v Speaker 6>that you're working together,</v>

2388
01:56:06.571 --> 01:56:07.404
<v Speaker 6>you're in nature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're around a fire and you're </v>

2389
01:56:09.361 --> 01:56:10.890
<v Speaker 6>successful at something that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>difficult.</v>

2390
01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.260
<v Speaker 6>All those things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even if they were assholes,</v>

2391
01:56:13.261 --> 01:56:15.450
<v Speaker 6>you'd probably find more common ground </v>
<v Speaker 6>with them there.</v>

2392
01:56:15.451 --> 01:56:17.340
<v Speaker 6>Then you would sit around a conference </v>
<v Speaker 6>table.</v>

2393
01:56:17.410 --> 01:56:18.243
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2394
01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:19.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely a,</v>

2395
01:56:20.410 --> 01:56:24.550
<v Speaker 3>there's also a separation from society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Complete total separation.</v>

2396
01:56:25.180 --> 01:56:27.010
<v Speaker 3>When you're up there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no cell phone signal.</v>

2397
01:56:27.011 --> 01:56:29.080
<v Speaker 3>You don't hear anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's complete silence.</v>

2398
01:56:29.081 --> 01:56:29.914
<v Speaker 3>It's a very strange feeling of almost a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lonely detachment because you realize </v>

2399
01:56:34.361 --> 01:56:36.430
<v Speaker 3>you are not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not just off the grid.</v>

2400
01:56:36.730 --> 01:56:39.370
<v Speaker 3>The grid is nowhere to be seen and we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need each other.</v>

2401
01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need each other.</v>

2402
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:41.103
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got it.</v>

2403
01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:42.020
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right</v>

2404
01:56:42.020 --> 01:56:42.853
<v Speaker 6>where we come from.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We come from this place where we need </v>

2405
01:56:44.751 --> 01:56:45.584
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And where were the first thing you </v>

2406
01:56:46.911 --> 01:56:47.780
<v Speaker 6>think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2407
01:56:47.781 --> 01:56:49.160
<v Speaker 6>like hunter gatherers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2408
01:56:49.161 --> 01:56:52.610
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they share arrows and so like,</v>

2409
01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:54.780
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they typically share Arrow.</v>

2410
01:56:54.781 --> 01:56:57.110
<v Speaker 6>So I make arrows a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You make them another way,</v>

2411
01:56:57.111 --> 01:56:59.180
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then we all give them to each other.</v>

2412
01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:02.660
<v Speaker 6>They're constantly flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you might be on a hunt where you shot</v>

2413
01:57:02.661 --> 01:57:06.050
<v Speaker 6>the elk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that Arrow that you shot is in the elk,</v>

2414
01:57:06.051 --> 01:57:11.051
<v Speaker 6>but I made it and it's a way of </v>
<v Speaker 6>obscuring who gets credit for the kill.</v>

2415
01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:12.013
<v Speaker 6>And that's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you find this universally among </v>

2416
01:57:14.421 --> 01:57:15.254
<v Speaker 6>foragers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether it's in the internet or in Papa </v>

2417
01:57:17.451 --> 01:57:18.650
<v Speaker 6>New Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They do these,</v>

2418
01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:23.660
<v Speaker 6>they have these mechanisms to make sure </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the sharing happens not only of the</v>

2419
01:57:23.661 --> 01:57:27.680
<v Speaker 6>meat but of the reputational aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's interesting.</v>

2420
01:57:27.681 --> 01:57:28.514
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are all these mechanisms built in </v>

2421
01:57:30.741 --> 01:57:33.740
<v Speaker 6>to keep anybody from getting too big for</v>
<v Speaker 6>their Britches,</v>

2422
01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:36.560
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>till the cannibals move in and then they</v>

2423
01:57:36.561 --> 01:57:37.140
<v Speaker 6>start killing</v>

2424
01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:41.040
<v Speaker 3>people and eating them because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>no protein because they couldn't get any</v>

2425
01:57:41.041 --> 01:57:41.874
<v Speaker 3>elk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a problem that cannabis will move </v>

2426
01:57:45.511 --> 01:57:46.250
<v Speaker 3>in</v>

2427
01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:47.540
<v Speaker 6>fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to be ready.</v>

2428
01:57:47.650 --> 01:57:50.000
<v Speaker 6>But here's the good news about the </v>
<v Speaker 6>locus.</v>

2429
01:57:50.150 --> 01:57:52.020
<v Speaker 6>They do switch bank,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take grass offers.</v>

2430
01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:54.380
<v Speaker 6>You can be aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stops.</v>

2431
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:55.730
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Eventually.</v>

2432
01:57:55.820 --> 01:57:57.440
<v Speaker 6>And then you can't fly anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You fuck.</v>

2433
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:58.363
<v Speaker 6>And Lucas are cannibalistic and </v>
<v Speaker 6>grasshoppers aren't to tie it into the </v>

2434
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:04.010
<v Speaker 6>whole cannibalism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2435
01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:06.040
<v Speaker 6>That's why they swarm because if you </v>
<v Speaker 6>slow down,</v>

2436
01:58:06.050 --> 01:58:07.190
<v Speaker 6>the one behind you will eat you.</v>

2437
01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:12.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where we are working at Amazon.</v>

2438
01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:15.950
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's like working in New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York City working on Amazon.</v>

2439
01:58:15.951 --> 01:58:16.840
<v Speaker 3>Supposed to be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2440
01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:20.200
<v Speaker 3>There's warehouses they'll run around </v>
<v Speaker 3>this time when you have a timer.</v>

2441
01:58:20.201 --> 01:58:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

2442
01:58:21.610 --> 01:58:22.443
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a radiolab podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was one of the podcasts I listened to </v>

2443
01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.540
<v Speaker 3>that talked to an ex employee at Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what kind of stress it is to work.</v>

2444
01:58:29.570 --> 01:58:30.403
<v Speaker 3>Like say if you order something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like say if you order a led flashlight </v>

2445
01:58:33.510 --> 01:58:35.590
<v Speaker 3>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it shows up on their.</v>

2446
01:58:35.591 --> 01:58:37.900
<v Speaker 3>They have like a little pad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

2447
01:58:38.010 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 3>a tablet device and it has a timer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like you have to</v>

2448
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.843
<v Speaker 6>go find this and you have to grab it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have like 30 seconds so you like </v>

2449
01:58:46.450 --> 01:58:48.790
<v Speaker 6>literally running,</v>
<v Speaker 6>looking for this flashlight and you have</v>

2450
01:58:48.791 --> 01:58:52.930
<v Speaker 6>to get it to the sorting and put it in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the box and get the label.</v>

2451
01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:55.043
<v Speaker 6>They had this terrible game show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a show like that when I was a </v>

2452
01:59:00.941 --> 01:59:04.000
<v Speaker 6>kid when we had to run the money maze or</v>
<v Speaker 6>something like that.</v>

2453
01:59:04.001 --> 01:59:04.834
<v Speaker 6>I remember that you had to fill your car</v>
<v Speaker 6>up with the most expensive things or </v>

2454
01:59:07.271 --> 01:59:09.100
<v Speaker 6>something and know this is a different </v>
<v Speaker 6>one.</v>

2455
01:59:09.130 --> 01:59:09.963
<v Speaker 6>This is where you got like couples and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you got the the like the wives up on a </v>

2456
01:59:14.021 --> 01:59:14.854
<v Speaker 6>platform and the two husbands down and </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's a maze like where the walls </v>

2457
01:59:17.740 --> 01:59:18.573
<v Speaker 6>seven feet high and the women can see </v>
<v Speaker 6>where the money is and they're yelling </v>

2458
01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:23.490
<v Speaker 6>to their husbands like rats and like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2459
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:24.343
<v Speaker 6>go left.</v>

2460
01:59:24.970 --> 01:59:29.320
<v Speaker 6>I said left that and the husbands are </v>
<v Speaker 6>scurrying around in the maze and whoever</v>

2461
01:59:29.321 --> 01:59:33.130
<v Speaker 6>gets to the money pot first wins.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's a good divorce generating game show</v>

2462
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:36.940
<v Speaker 6>like so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you think,</v>

2463
01:59:36.941 --> 01:59:38.200
<v Speaker 6>man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think it's hopeless?</v>

2464
01:59:38.201 --> 01:59:42.730
<v Speaker 6>This you like when you talk about it and</v>
<v Speaker 6>you talk about it and then I think about</v>

2465
01:59:42.731 --> 01:59:44.410
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

2466
01:59:44.411 --> 01:59:48.920
<v Speaker 6>so it fills you this as a kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 6>weirdness Dahlia.</v>

2467
01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:49.773
<v Speaker 6>Like you think my God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this there's a type of life that is </v>

2468
01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:54.243
<v Speaker 6>clearly still accessible to people but </v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe not accessible to everyone as a </v>

2469
01:59:57.881 --> 01:59:58.714
<v Speaker 6>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you have any idea of like how you </v>

2470
02:00:01.571 --> 02:00:05.620
<v Speaker 6>would reorganize or restructure?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I say in the book is,</v>

2471
02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:07.930
<v Speaker 6>is where there's no way we're going </v>
<v Speaker 6>back.</v>

2472
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:09.340
<v Speaker 6>That's over,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2473
02:00:09.341 --> 02:00:10.174
<v Speaker 6>Because there's 7 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're going to be 10 billion in 100 </v>

2474
02:00:12.131 --> 02:00:13.120
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no way.</v>

2475
02:00:13.121 --> 02:00:15.370
<v Speaker 6>There's not enough land or animals or </v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever,</v>

2476
02:00:15.670 --> 02:00:18.100
<v Speaker 6>so we're going to live in an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 6>environment,</v>

2477
02:00:18.101 --> 02:00:20.080
<v Speaker 6>but you know you're going to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 6>zoo.</v>

2478
02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:22.600
<v Speaker 6>Do you want to live in the Calcutta zoo </v>
<v Speaker 6>or the San Diego zoo?</v>

2479
02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:23.741
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2480
02:00:23.741 --> 02:00:25.060
<v Speaker 6>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The San Diego Zoo.</v>

2481
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:25.953
<v Speaker 6>It's built with an understanding of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>natural environment of the animals that </v>

2482
02:00:29.771 --> 02:00:30.604
<v Speaker 6>are enclosed there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I want to live in a natural </v>

2483
02:00:32.171 --> 02:00:35.350
<v Speaker 6>environment that's got my interest in </v>
<v Speaker 6>mind and in order to do that,</v>

2484
02:00:35.351 --> 02:00:38.200
<v Speaker 6>you have to understand what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>animal homo sapiens is,</v>

2485
02:00:38.530 --> 02:00:39.363
<v Speaker 6>which means you have to cut through a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of the bullshit propaganda that </v>

2486
02:00:41.621 --> 02:00:42.454
<v Speaker 6>you've been here in your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This hobbs and bullshit about how </v>

2487
02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.290
<v Speaker 6>prehistoric people all died in their </v>
<v Speaker 6>thirties.</v>

2488
02:00:47.291 --> 02:00:50.980
<v Speaker 6>And it was a struggle for survival and </v>
<v Speaker 6>predators lurked in every shadow.</v>

2489
02:00:50.981 --> 02:00:52.600
<v Speaker 6>And it was this terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2490
02:00:52.601 --> 02:00:55.810
<v Speaker 6>dangerous world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You actually look at the anthropological</v>

2491
02:00:55.811 --> 02:00:57.760
<v Speaker 6>data.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hunter gatherers are chilled out,</v>

2492
02:00:57.761 --> 02:00:58.594
<v Speaker 6>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>relaxed people who are not dealing with </v>

2493
02:01:00.791 --> 02:01:01.624
<v Speaker 6>the sorts of chronic stress we are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you hear all these bullshit </v>

2494
02:01:03.851 --> 02:01:04.684
<v Speaker 6>arguments that wouldn't last a second if</v>
<v Speaker 6>they weren't propping up the </v>

2495
02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:10.633
<v Speaker 6>civilizational edifice like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everyone died in their thirties and </v>

2496
02:01:14.270 --> 02:01:16.780
<v Speaker 6>hunter gathers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's absolutely untrue.</v>

2497
02:01:17.290 --> 02:01:18.123
<v Speaker 6>But I just heard the dean of the Medical</v>
<v Speaker 6>School of Columbia University say it in </v>

2498
02:01:21.661 --> 02:01:23.210
<v Speaker 6>an NPR interview.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2499
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:24.263
<v Speaker 6>it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not The worst thing to happen to die </v>

2500
02:01:26.891 --> 02:01:27.671
<v Speaker 6>young.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2501
02:01:27.671 --> 02:01:30.040
<v Speaker 6>there's certainly some benefits to </v>
<v Speaker 6>modern medicine.</v>

2502
02:01:30.250 --> 02:01:31.430
<v Speaker 6>One hundred percent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's,</v>

2503
02:01:31.630 --> 02:01:36.370
<v Speaker 6>there's also some negative consequences </v>
<v Speaker 6>of our overly complicated society.</v>

2504
02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.330
<v Speaker 6>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean the,</v>

2505
02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:40.430
<v Speaker 6>the levels of depression that people </v>
<v Speaker 6>experienced</v>

2506
02:01:40.430 --> 02:01:42.740
<v Speaker 5>in the levels of discontent with their </v>
<v Speaker 5>existence.</v>

2507
02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:44.053
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were talking yesterday about people </v>

2508
02:01:46.131 --> 02:01:48.620
<v Speaker 5>wanting to take a chance to go do </v>
<v Speaker 5>something.</v>

2509
02:01:48.621 --> 02:01:51.560
<v Speaker 5>They want to do something outside of </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they're doing for a job.</v>

2510
02:01:51.561 --> 02:01:52.394
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe they have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe they like making pottery or </v>

2511
02:01:54.411 --> 02:01:56.210
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but they just don't have the time.</v>

2512
02:01:56.211 --> 02:01:57.044
<v Speaker 5>Maybe they want to be a tattooist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just don't have the time to </v>

2513
02:01:59.361 --> 02:02:00.194
<v Speaker 5>dedicate to jump into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then along the way get saddled with </v>

2514
02:02:02.691 --> 02:02:05.750
<v Speaker 5>debt and maybe a family that you have an</v>
<v Speaker 5>obligation to feed.</v>

2515
02:02:05.751 --> 02:02:08.750
<v Speaker 5>And then you're stuck in your trap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That trap that,</v>

2516
02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:12.500
<v Speaker 5>that feeling of discontent with one's </v>
<v Speaker 5>own daily existence.</v>

2517
02:02:12.501 --> 02:02:15.410
<v Speaker 5>You Day by day life is more commonplace </v>
<v Speaker 5>than not.</v>

2518
02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:18.380
<v Speaker 5>It's way more common.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's essential because we were saying to</v>

2519
02:02:18.381 --> 02:02:19.214
<v Speaker 5>keep you running on the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got to believe x is going to make </v>

2520
02:02:21.981 --> 02:02:22.430
<v Speaker 5>you happy.</v>

2521
02:02:22.430 --> 02:02:25.130
<v Speaker 5>The cars going to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next thing is going to do it.</v>

2522
02:02:25.790 --> 02:02:28.120
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's a pernicious lie that,</v>

2523
02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:31.130
<v Speaker 5>that we've heard so many times we come </v>
<v Speaker 5>to believe it's an,</v>

2524
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:34.880
<v Speaker 5>it's an aspect of reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it isn't.</v>

2525
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:36.260
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>

2526
02:02:36.261 --> 02:02:38.390
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you look at the hunter gather data,</v>

2527
02:02:38.391 --> 02:02:40.730
<v Speaker 5>what you see is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is these people who,</v>

2528
02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:42.320
<v Speaker 5>I mean you were talking about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>earlier,</v>

2529
02:02:42.321 --> 02:02:46.130
<v Speaker 5>how we need something to like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>challenge to take us to the next level.</v>

2530
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:47.623
<v Speaker 5>For them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the challenge is like we're going to go </v>

2531
02:02:49.131 --> 02:02:50.240
<v Speaker 5>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2532
02:02:50.241 --> 02:02:51.074
<v Speaker 5>and it'll feel great and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we'll eat and if we don't eat they </v>

2533
02:02:53.991 --> 02:02:56.630
<v Speaker 5>will eat tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well that's why those subsistence shows.</v>

2534
02:02:56.631 --> 02:02:59.570
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever watched those shows and </v>
<v Speaker 5>discovery channel shows?</v>

2535
02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:00.613
<v Speaker 5>Those shows are extremely popular today </v>
<v Speaker 5>because people are sort of recognizing </v>

2536
02:03:03.921 --> 02:03:04.880
<v Speaker 5>that like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>

2537
02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:08.210
<v Speaker 5>these people seem happy and all they </v>
<v Speaker 5>have is like five dogs.</v>

2538
02:03:08.210 --> 02:03:09.043
<v Speaker 5>They live in Alaska and they just take </v>
<v Speaker 5>their sled out and they chopped down a </v>

2539
02:03:11.811 --> 02:03:16.760
<v Speaker 5>fucking tree to build a house with like </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people are living on the stamina.</v>

2540
02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:20.540
<v Speaker 5>That's the thing is immediacy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just to play devil's advocate here,</v>

2541
02:03:20.541 --> 02:03:23.550
<v Speaker 5>isn't this a different version of what </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about?</v>

2542
02:03:23.551 --> 02:03:26.000
<v Speaker 5>The modern human thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I have this thing,</v>

2543
02:03:26.001 --> 02:03:28.670
<v Speaker 5>a car or whatever the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the nicer job,</v>

2544
02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:30.410
<v Speaker 5>better or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be happy.</v>

2545
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:34.940
<v Speaker 5>What you're saying is if I have an </v>
<v Speaker 5>immediacy,</v>

2546
02:03:34.941 --> 02:03:37.610
<v Speaker 5>if I'm more connected to nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I moved to Alaska,</v>

2547
02:03:37.611 --> 02:03:39.860
<v Speaker 5>if I become a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll be happy,</v>

2548
02:03:39.861 --> 02:03:40.694
<v Speaker 5>but both of these things have within </v>
<v Speaker 5>them the idea that I need some other </v>

2549
02:03:45.561 --> 02:03:50.510
<v Speaker 5>thing to be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whereas the what I keep hearing and what</v>

2550
02:03:50.511 --> 02:03:55.511
<v Speaker 5>I subscribed to you is that to be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to be in the present moment.</v>

2551
02:03:55.881 --> 02:03:57.980
<v Speaker 5>Wherever you are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever situation you're in,</v>

2552
02:03:57.981 --> 02:03:58.814
<v Speaker 5>whatever's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether you're in an office and a job </v>

2553
02:04:01.281 --> 02:04:04.730
<v Speaker 5>you don't like in a marriage you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>like with a bunch of kids that you don't</v>

2554
02:04:04.731 --> 02:04:05.390
<v Speaker 5>like.</v>

2555
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Instead of fleeing from that by planning</v>
<v Speaker 5>some fantasy of becoming a tattoo artist</v>

2556
02:04:11.181 --> 02:04:12.014
<v Speaker 5>or a potter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're real way out is to allow </v>

2557
02:04:14.661 --> 02:04:15.494
<v Speaker 5>yourself to be fully in the experience </v>
<v Speaker 5>of what's happening right now and not </v>

2558
02:04:20.450 --> 02:04:21.283
<v Speaker 5>that thing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just doing that and maybe that is what </v>

2559
02:04:23.661 --> 02:04:26.250
<v Speaker 5>happens when you're in nature as you are</v>
<v Speaker 5>more in the present moment,</v>

2560
02:04:26.251 --> 02:04:27.084
<v Speaker 5>but that makes way more sense when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in nature because if you're </v>

2561
02:04:29.391 --> 02:04:30.224
<v Speaker 5>working in an insurance company and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>just go on over client's claims day in </v>

2562
02:04:33.141 --> 02:04:33.974
<v Speaker 5>and day out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's super hard to be in a joyful </v>

2563
02:04:35.391 --> 02:04:36.224
<v Speaker 5>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's super hard to be when you really </v>

2564
02:04:37.801 --> 02:04:38.010
<v Speaker 5>want</v>

2565
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>to get out of there and make music like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have songs and ideas in your head.</v>

2566
02:04:42.401 --> 02:04:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to put them to wax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your fucking kids need formula?</v>

2567
02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

2568
02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:47.393
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jus.</v>

2569
02:04:47.550 --> 02:04:50.100
<v Speaker 1>The thing is it's like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is,</v>

2570
02:04:50.250 --> 02:04:51.930
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure,</v>

2571
02:04:52.380 --> 02:04:54.840
<v Speaker 1>but this is where you're at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

2572
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:55.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where you are.</v>

2573
02:04:55.890 --> 02:04:56.723
<v Speaker 1>You're not at a situation where you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to start a band and you're not in </v>

2574
02:04:58.891 --> 02:04:59.724
<v Speaker 1>a situation where you're going to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>a potter right now could be in the </v>

2575
02:05:01.981 --> 02:05:04.830
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the trick is that even though you're</v>

2576
02:05:04.831 --> 02:05:09.720
<v Speaker 1>not in the fucking Anna rondex hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not fishing,</v>

2577
02:05:09.870 --> 02:05:12.180
<v Speaker 1>even though you're wherever you're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

2578
02:05:12.630 --> 02:05:14.820
<v Speaker 1>get into that place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let Yourself,</v>

2579
02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:17.610
<v Speaker 1>and it's not about happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not about joy or bliss or</v>

2580
02:05:17.611 --> 02:05:19.980
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not feeling joy and bliss.</v>

2581
02:05:19.980 --> 02:05:20.813
<v Speaker 1>You're feeling a kind of claustrophobic </v>
<v Speaker 1>horror at the concept that what the </v>

2582
02:05:25.381 --> 02:05:26.214
<v Speaker 1>situation you're in right now is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to continue forever and so your mind is </v>

2583
02:05:29.701 --> 02:05:33.270
<v Speaker 1>fabricated and escape route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this thing or that thing,</v>

2584
02:05:33.271 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the true,</v>

2585
02:05:36.330 --> 02:05:37.163
<v Speaker 1>the true situation is that until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>train yourself to be in the present </v>

2586
02:05:41.341 --> 02:05:44.100
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter where you are,</v>

2587
02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:46.770
<v Speaker 1>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not alive,</v>

2588
02:05:46.771 --> 02:05:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

2589
02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:49.530
<v Speaker 1>You have to train yourself to get in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

2590
02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Then once you're in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then start making the move.</v>

2591
02:05:53.340 --> 02:05:54.173
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you say in the moment like how do </v>

2592
02:05:55.441 --> 02:05:56.770
<v Speaker 1>you address that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2593
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:59.010
<v Speaker 1>When you're thinking about you being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment,</v>

2594
02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:01.050
<v Speaker 1>like your own personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do,</v>

2595
02:06:01.160 --> 02:06:05.010
<v Speaker 1>what do you do to try to achieve that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of centered feeling?</v>

2596
02:06:05.070 --> 02:06:05.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2597
02:06:05.640 --> 02:06:08.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the practice of mindfulness.</v>

2598
02:06:08.160 --> 02:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>So it's the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2599
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:15.370
<v Speaker 1>what it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will notice from time to time when I'm</v>

2600
02:06:15.571 --> 02:06:16.404
<v Speaker 1>lucky that I've been carried away by my </v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts like that fucking thing you </v>

2601
02:06:19.271 --> 02:06:21.900
<v Speaker 1>were saying about laying in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can generate more stress chemicals.</v>

2602
02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:24.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll recognize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2603
02:06:24.630 --> 02:06:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I've been in a vortex of thinking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last two days.</v>

2604
02:06:29.641 --> 02:06:34.641
<v Speaker 1>I've been caught in this like endless </v>
<v Speaker 1>recurring series of worries or scenarios</v>

2605
02:06:35.731 --> 02:06:38.910
<v Speaker 1>or whatever it may be or things I need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do or things I uh,</v>

2606
02:06:38.911 --> 02:06:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I just did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2607
02:06:40.530 --> 02:06:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and suddenly I realized I haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>here at all at all.</v>

2608
02:06:45.151 --> 02:06:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I've just been caught up in what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>called in your head.</v>

2609
02:06:47.161 --> 02:06:49.860
<v Speaker 1>You're caught up in the thought pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

2610
02:06:49.861 --> 02:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practice is,</v>

2611
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:53.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something like,</v>

2612
02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:54.773
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2613
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:55.913
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Kornfield talks about how the Guy </v>

2614
02:06:56.941 --> 02:06:59.460
<v Speaker 1>who taught in meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adrienne Shaw,</v>

2615
02:06:59.790 --> 02:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2616
02:07:01.290 --> 02:07:05.790
<v Speaker 1>was saying to him that I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his students was saying,</v>

2617
02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm too busy to meditate.</v>

2618
02:07:08.590 --> 02:07:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm too busy to Metadata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have time to do that.</v>

2619
02:07:10.381 --> 02:07:13.020
<v Speaker 1>And his response was our youtube busy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathe.</v>

2620
02:07:13.330 --> 02:07:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Are you too busy to breathe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can breathe,</v>

2621
02:07:15.031 --> 02:07:17.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you need to do.</v>

2622
02:07:17.220 --> 02:07:20.160
<v Speaker 1>All you need is your breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no matter where you are,</v>

2623
02:07:20.161 --> 02:07:21.510
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're at,</v>

2624
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:22.703
<v Speaker 1>you can begin to put your attention away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the incredible array of worries </v>

2625
02:07:27.601 --> 02:07:28.434
<v Speaker 1>that you have incredible array of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasies that you have incredible </v>

2626
02:07:30.631 --> 02:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>arrays of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this had happened,</v>

2627
02:07:32.251 --> 02:07:33.084
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happier if I could do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be a better person and just bring </v>

2628
02:07:36.881 --> 02:07:40.570
<v Speaker 1>it to your breath in and out and through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nose,</v>

2629
02:07:40.571 --> 02:07:41.404
<v Speaker 1>out through the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's not going to stop these </v>

2630
02:07:43.391 --> 02:07:44.224
<v Speaker 1>fucking thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead of you being controlled by </v>

2631
02:07:46.841 --> 02:07:48.600
<v Speaker 1>them and caught up in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2632
02:07:48.601 --> 02:07:50.320
<v Speaker 1>you talk about looking at your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phone.</v>

2633
02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Get rid of cell phones.</v>

2634
02:07:52.150 --> 02:07:52.983
<v Speaker 1>People are still looking at cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just their various worries and </v>

2635
02:07:55.690 --> 02:07:57.730
<v Speaker 1>things that they're constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>ruminating over.</v>

2636
02:07:57.940 --> 02:07:58.773
<v Speaker 1>It's another form of the cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're fixating on these endless </v>

2637
02:08:01.601 --> 02:08:04.840
<v Speaker 1>recurring worries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you bring it to the breath,</v>

2638
02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:07.810
<v Speaker 1>the worries emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the happiness,</v>

2639
02:08:07.811 --> 02:08:11.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not you.</v>

2640
02:08:11.620 --> 02:08:16.480
<v Speaker 1>You're not identifying with it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not identifying with the specific</v>

2641
02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:17.493
<v Speaker 1>emotional state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this specific intellectual state the </v>

2642
02:08:20.481 --> 02:08:21.314
<v Speaker 1>specific thing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just observing and watching and </v>

2643
02:08:24.311 --> 02:08:26.500
<v Speaker 1>that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that consciousness,</v>

2644
02:08:26.650 --> 02:08:27.483
<v Speaker 1>the more you become that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you will find yourself </v>

2645
02:08:29.351 --> 02:08:31.360
<v Speaker 1>experiencing what you were talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2646
02:08:31.630 --> 02:08:34.810
<v Speaker 1>These rare moments of peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these moments of like,</v>

2647
02:08:34.811 --> 02:08:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

2648
02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:38.500
<v Speaker 1>regardless of what's happening around </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2649
02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:43.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm still centered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>untouched,</v>

2650
02:08:43.480 --> 02:08:46.030
<v Speaker 1>unfreaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unanxious.</v>

2651
02:08:46.090 --> 02:08:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm just watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

2652
02:08:48.430 --> 02:08:49.061
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2653
02:08:49.061 --> 02:08:49.894
<v Speaker 1>the concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very hopeful concept because </v>

2654
02:08:52.271 --> 02:08:53.104
<v Speaker 1>some people do not have access to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of zoo you're talking about </v>

2655
02:08:56.620 --> 02:08:58.000
<v Speaker 1>prisoners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2656
02:08:58.180 --> 02:08:59.013
<v Speaker 1>people who are incarcerated right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get to get out of that </v>

2657
02:09:01.511 --> 02:09:02.230
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2658
02:09:02.230 --> 02:09:03.063
<v Speaker 1>So they have to find a way in the midst </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of that negative phenomena to </v>

2659
02:09:07.151 --> 02:09:07.984
<v Speaker 1>allow themselves to experience the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of peace or tranquility that you </v>

2660
02:09:10.981 --> 02:09:14.590
<v Speaker 1>were experiencing with your friends in </v>
<v Speaker 1>front of that Campfire,</v>

2661
02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:18.700
<v Speaker 1>and that is why the concept of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultivation is so important in Buddhism,</v>

2662
02:09:18.701 --> 02:09:19.534
<v Speaker 1>which is the idea that these experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in various many different world </v>

2663
02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:26.170
<v Speaker 1>religions say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their route,</v>

2664
02:09:26.171 --> 02:09:30.280
<v Speaker 1>what is so wonderful about them is love </v>
<v Speaker 1>that feeling of love,</v>

2665
02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:33.430
<v Speaker 1>which is also compared to the feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming home,</v>

2666
02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:36.070
<v Speaker 1>being at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding your home,</v>

2667
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:39.100
<v Speaker 1>coming back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all the same because the feeling of</v>

2668
02:09:39.101 --> 02:09:39.934
<v Speaker 1>what is the feeling of being at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a feeling of being at what did you </v>

2669
02:09:42.221 --> 02:09:44.260
<v Speaker 1>call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a situation of acceptance and love.</v>

2670
02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:45.393
<v Speaker 1>It's that feeling of being sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly safe or not safe because of the </v>

2671
02:09:48.101 --> 02:09:48.934
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but safe because you're surrounded by </v>

2672
02:09:50.561 --> 02:09:51.394
<v Speaker 1>people who love you and you're loving </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you know that you can be taken </v>

2673
02:09:54.191 --> 02:09:54.790
<v Speaker 1>care of.</v>

2674
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:55.623
<v Speaker 1>The concept is that feeling can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultivated in that cultivation starts </v>

2675
02:09:59.531 --> 02:10:04.150
<v Speaker 1>with some form of the practice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness or whatever you want to call</v>

2676
02:10:04.151 --> 02:10:04.984
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying actually </v>

2677
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:09.610
<v Speaker 1>isn't in conflict at all with the the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other point,</v>

2678
02:10:09.611 --> 02:10:10.444
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the because the mindfulness being here </v>

2679
02:10:12.131 --> 02:10:16.840
<v Speaker 1>in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're like,</v>

2680
02:10:16.841 --> 02:10:17.674
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a shitty job in a cubicle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're trying to distract yourself </v>

2681
02:10:21.431 --> 02:10:22.264
<v Speaker 1>from it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to podcasts all day </v>

2682
02:10:23.141 --> 02:10:25.120
<v Speaker 1>while you shuffle paperwork or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2683
02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:26.433
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're not really being in the </v>

2684
02:10:28.121 --> 02:10:28.954
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is advantageous to be in the moment </v>

2685
02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 1>if it allows you to see</v>

2686
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:39.080
<v Speaker 5>that the moment is fucking killing you </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then you make a realistic.</v>

2687
02:10:39.081 --> 02:10:40.340
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to be a hunter </v>
<v Speaker 5>gatherer,</v>

2688
02:10:40.341 --> 02:10:43.490
<v Speaker 5>but you make a realistic plan to change </v>
<v Speaker 5>your life.</v>

2689
02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:46.700
<v Speaker 5>It can be abused,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2690
02:10:46.701 --> 02:10:47.600
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're in prison,</v>

2691
02:10:47.601 --> 02:10:50.000
<v Speaker 5>that's a different deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going to be there for 10 years.</v>

2692
02:10:50.001 --> 02:10:52.760
<v Speaker 5>You're not gonna like don't try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>escape is my advice,</v>

2693
02:10:53.150 --> 02:10:55.490
<v Speaker 5>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if it's just a dead end job,</v>

2694
02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:56.753
<v Speaker 5>I mean I got this great email a couple </v>
<v Speaker 5>days ago from someone who I had these </v>

<v Speaker 5>It's doable if you're.</v>

2726
02:12:13.941 --> 02:12:16.520
<v Speaker 5>If you're willing to give up a lot of </v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Digital nomads,</v>

2745
02:12:59.810 --> 02:13:02.270
<v Speaker 5>you know about them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a growing,</v>

2746
02:13:02.271 --> 02:13:03.104
<v Speaker 5>thriving world of young people who have </v>
<v Speaker 5>jobs where they do stuff on the </v>

2747
02:13:06.591 --> 02:13:07.251
<v Speaker 5>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2748
02:13:07.251 --> 02:13:09.470
<v Speaker 5>They either coding or editing or </v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

2749
02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:11.240
<v Speaker 5>Something you can do through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer.</v>

2750
02:13:11.690 --> 02:13:14.150
<v Speaker 5>So if you're making money through the </v>
<v Speaker 5>computer,</v>

2751
02:13:14.151 --> 02:13:16.430
<v Speaker 5>why he living in la where you're paying </v>
<v Speaker 5>two grand,</v>

2752
02:13:16.431 --> 02:13:17.280
<v Speaker 5>three grand for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2753
02:13:17.480 --> 02:13:20.240
<v Speaker 5>So they moved to places like Bangkok,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ecuador,</v>

2754
02:13:20.241 --> 02:13:21.074
<v Speaker 5>there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's like hotspots around the world </v>

2755
02:13:22.371 --> 02:13:25.550
<v Speaker 5>where there are thousands of these </v>
<v Speaker 5>people living out of backpacks,</v>

2756
02:13:25.551 --> 02:13:26.384
<v Speaker 5>they live in guest houses and they work </v>
<v Speaker 5>in cafes or wherever they get Wifi and </v>

2757
02:13:30.140 --> 02:13:31.920
<v Speaker 5>that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it's a</v>

2758
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.590
<v Speaker 2>funny thing because they're ahead of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws,</v>

2759
02:13:34.591 --> 02:13:35.424
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tax laws don't know what to do with </v>

2760
02:13:36.271 --> 02:13:40.260
<v Speaker 2>these people because you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not stable anywhere.</v>

2761
02:13:40.261 --> 02:13:42.300
<v Speaker 2>And the laws are all set up where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay tax,</v>

2762
02:13:42.301 --> 02:13:45.570
<v Speaker 2>where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm three months in Bangkok,</v>

2763
02:13:45.571 --> 02:13:47.670
<v Speaker 2>then I'm off to Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm off here like,</v>

2764
02:13:47.700 --> 02:13:49.170
<v Speaker 2>well who do I pay tax too?</v>

2765
02:13:49.610 --> 02:13:50.443
<v Speaker 4>I'll take it to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if you switched everything to </v>

2766
02:13:51.891 --> 02:13:52.724
<v Speaker 4>digital currency and finding more and </v>
<v Speaker 4>more people are accepting bitcoin and </v>

2767
02:13:55.671 --> 02:13:56.504
<v Speaker 4>other forms of digital currency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they start using that to pay for the </v>

2768
02:13:58.561 --> 02:13:59.960
<v Speaker 4>rent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay for their food,</v>

2769
02:13:59.961 --> 02:14:01.820
<v Speaker 4>pay for their drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay for their travel,</v>

2770
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:03.830
<v Speaker 4>no record of animal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck.</v>

2771
02:14:04.490 --> 02:14:06.380
<v Speaker 4>And then they live in Thailand </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>

2772
02:14:06.381 --> 02:14:07.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they don't.</v>

2773
02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:10.353
<v Speaker 4>Wild Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so it should be the idea of you </v>

2774
02:14:12.381 --> 02:14:13.214
<v Speaker 4>being constrained to a patch of dirt and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to have a piece of paper to </v>

2775
02:14:16.671 --> 02:14:19.850
<v Speaker 4>show other people and the other patch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirt so I can cross over.</v>

2776
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:22.430
<v Speaker 4>Can I enter into your kingdom?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Depends.</v>

2777
02:14:22.490 --> 02:14:27.350
<v Speaker 4>Did you at one point in time drive your </v>
<v Speaker 4>carriage under the influence of wine,</v>

2778
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:29.843
<v Speaker 4>but I was in the call was denied entry </v>
<v Speaker 4>into my kingdom of doubt of you're in a </v>

2779
02:14:37.221 --> 02:14:40.190
<v Speaker 4>car with someone and they're drunk and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're sober and you get pulled over.</v>

2780
02:14:40.190 --> 02:14:41.810
<v Speaker 4>You're going to get a Dui.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get that.</v>

2781
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:42.743
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that person's drunk and you're an </v>

2782
02:14:44.421 --> 02:14:46.730
<v Speaker 4>adult and you're sober and that person's</v>
<v Speaker 4>drunk driving,</v>

2783
02:14:46.731 --> 02:14:47.564
<v Speaker 4>you can get a dui to try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get in trouble for allowing </v>

2784
02:14:50.661 --> 02:14:53.550
<v Speaker 4>someone to drive a car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what exact for polk.</v>

2785
02:14:53.690 --> 02:14:58.130
<v Speaker 4>Find out what exactly the law is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck would you mainly similar.</v>

2786
02:14:58.380 --> 02:15:00.000
<v Speaker 4>It's extremely similar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you will.</v>

2787
02:15:00.170 --> 02:15:03.020
<v Speaker 4>I believe in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be a state to state basis or am</v>

2788
02:15:03.021 --> 02:15:04.910
<v Speaker 4>I just made it up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm pretty sure it's true.</v>

2789
02:15:05.180 --> 02:15:06.470
<v Speaker 4>If you are drunk,</v>

2790
02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I made it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

2791
02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:09.733
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are drunk and you have a </v>

2792
02:15:10.511 --> 02:15:11.344
<v Speaker 2>passenger in your car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that passenger I think in can get </v>

2793
02:15:13.601 --> 02:15:14.950
<v Speaker 2>arrested as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2794
02:15:15.100 --> 02:15:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Even if they don't have a driver's </v>
<v Speaker 2>license,</v>

2795
02:15:17.230 --> 02:15:19.510
<v Speaker 2>if they're an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they can get arrested as well if</v>

2796
02:15:19.511 --> 02:15:21.070
<v Speaker 2>they don't have a driver's license at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

2797
02:15:21.071 --> 02:15:21.904
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting because then it's </v>

2798
02:15:23.171 --> 02:15:24.240
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well officer,</v>

2799
02:15:24.250 --> 02:15:26.640
<v Speaker 2>you know it took the wheel but you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving without a license.</v>

2800
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:27.583
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

2801
02:15:28.050 --> 02:15:31.300
<v Speaker 2>but my point being they won't let you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Canada,</v>

2802
02:15:31.450 --> 02:15:33.970
<v Speaker 2>if you have a Dui they'll go fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get out of here.</v>

2803
02:15:34.030 --> 02:15:36.990
<v Speaker 2>They turn you around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want no douchebags in Canada.</v>

2804
02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.580
<v Speaker 2>If you have a violent assault and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your arrest record.</v>

2805
02:15:39.730 --> 02:15:40.563
<v Speaker 2>I almost got kicked out it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost got not let into Canada had a </v>

2806
02:15:43.410 --> 02:15:48.070
<v Speaker 2>will for having stolen a snickers bar in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska in 1982.</v>

2807
02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2808
02:15:49.630 --> 02:15:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I went to prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I told that story.</v>

2809
02:15:51.611 --> 02:15:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did this area.</v>

2810
02:15:53.501 --> 02:15:56.890
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I was told when I did four days,</v>

2811
02:15:56.891 --> 02:15:57.724
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I went before the magistrate </v>

2812
02:15:58.841 --> 02:16:01.150
<v Speaker 2>and he said if you don't get arrested </v>
<v Speaker 2>again in a year,</v>

2813
02:16:01.151 --> 02:16:02.890
<v Speaker 2>this will go off your record and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2814
02:16:03.310 --> 02:16:07.060
<v Speaker 2>So ever since when I've been asked if </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever been convicted of a crime,</v>

2815
02:16:07.061 --> 02:16:09.700
<v Speaker 2>I always said no because I figured it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not on my record.</v>

2816
02:16:09.701 --> 02:16:11.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to confuse everybody and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2817
02:16:11.441 --> 02:16:12.580
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2818
02:16:12.581 --> 02:16:15.850
<v Speaker 2>but the first time we went into Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>at BC,</v>

2819
02:16:16.130 --> 02:16:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked all these questions and we went</v>

2820
02:16:18.101 --> 02:16:20.580
<v Speaker 2>and sat down and he called me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2821
02:16:20.650 --> 02:16:21.483
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2822
02:16:21.650 --> 02:16:23.680
<v Speaker 2>my wife and you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2823
02:16:23.770 --> 02:16:28.480
<v Speaker 2>is there anything you want to tell me </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 1980 to 1982,</v>

2824
02:16:28.481 --> 02:16:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was college and</v>

2825
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:33.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arrest and conviction,</v>

2826
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:35.110
<v Speaker 1>fairbanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska.</v>

2827
02:16:35.350 --> 02:16:37.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you kidding me?</v>

2828
02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:38.153
<v Speaker 1>And I told him I eat a snickers bar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking grocery store and it turned </v>

2829
02:16:40.841 --> 02:16:41.674
<v Speaker 1>into this thing and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they told me it wasn't on my record </v>

2830
02:16:43.781 --> 02:16:44.614
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2831
02:16:44.800 --> 02:16:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Canada gets your FBI records.</v>

2832
02:16:48.550 --> 02:16:49.383
<v Speaker 4>So.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're ever so like there's a </v>

2833
02:16:51.031 --> 02:16:53.700
<v Speaker 4>federal level where that shit doesn't go</v>
<v Speaker 4>away,</v>

2834
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:54.783
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's even more deep because Eddie Bravo </v>

2835
02:16:56.221 --> 02:16:57.054
<v Speaker 4>got arrested and never even went to jail</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it shows up every time he goes into </v>

2836
02:16:59.881 --> 02:17:00.714
<v Speaker 4>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He got arrested because he worked for a </v>

2837
02:17:01.831 --> 02:17:02.664
<v Speaker 4>check cashing company and so he used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>drive around with large sums of cash on </v>

2838
02:17:05.731 --> 02:17:07.200
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he got pulled over by the cops,</v>

2839
02:17:07.530 --> 02:17:09.300
<v Speaker 4>cops pulled them over and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>officer,</v>

2840
02:17:09.301 --> 02:17:12.030
<v Speaker 4>I want to let you know that I have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>loaded handgun in the car.</v>

2841
02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:13.620
<v Speaker 4>Here's my license to have it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>

2842
02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:15.630
<v Speaker 4>please step out of the car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They handcuff him,</v>

2843
02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:17.820
<v Speaker 4>they check everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure it's all kosher,</v>

2844
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:19.380
<v Speaker 4>everything checks out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They let them go.</v>

2845
02:17:19.770 --> 02:17:24.570
<v Speaker 4>But that incident is on his record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when he goes into Canada,</v>

2846
02:17:24.571 --> 02:17:27.570
<v Speaker 4>they pull them aside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time I got stuff with him once,</v>

2847
02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:29.730
<v Speaker 4>now I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we go to Canada together,</v>

2848
02:17:29.731 --> 02:17:31.730
<v Speaker 4>I left that to get ahead of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2849
02:17:31.780 --> 02:17:35.750
<v Speaker 4>y'all fucking meet you outside because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets dragged into that room.</v>

2850
02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Then they start asking you questions </v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

2851
02:17:37.381 --> 02:17:38.214
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2852
02:17:38.310 --> 02:17:39.820
<v Speaker 1>at least they're Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2853
02:17:40.090 --> 02:17:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Hearing hearing were coming the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2854
02:17:42.270 --> 02:17:43.103
<v Speaker 1>It is</v>

2855
02:17:43.610 --> 02:17:44.443
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can't offer a convincing defense </v>

2856
02:17:47.061 --> 02:17:47.894
<v Speaker 4>as to why you weren't driving,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you may also be arrested and charged </v>

2857
02:17:50.471 --> 02:17:52.690
<v Speaker 4>with reckless endangerment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're arresting.</v>

2858
02:17:52.691 --> 02:17:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Officer will argue that you put </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

2859
02:17:54.671 --> 02:17:55.504
<v Speaker 4>the driver and members of the public in </v>
<v Speaker 4>danger by allowing your friend to drive </v>

2860
02:17:57.671 --> 02:17:58.504
<v Speaker 4>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their case may be bolstered by the </v>

2861
02:18:00.911 --> 02:18:03.190
<v Speaker 4>presence of other passengers in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>vehicle.</v>

2862
02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:05.860
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2863
02:18:06.130 --> 02:18:09.160
<v Speaker 4>You'll need to prove that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The paragraph before that said,</v>

2864
02:18:09.161 --> 02:18:13.600
<v Speaker 4>you need to prove that you're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>currently licensed to drive.</v>

2865
02:18:13.601 --> 02:18:14.434
<v Speaker 4>Don't know how to drive or have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>medical restriction that prevents you </v>

2866
02:18:16.931 --> 02:18:19.480
<v Speaker 4>from driving crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2867
02:18:19.481 --> 02:18:20.970
<v Speaker 4>See.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm kinda right.</v>

2868
02:18:21.310 --> 02:18:22.143
<v Speaker 1>Better off being shit faced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if your shit faced and your friend's </v>

2869
02:18:25.091 --> 02:18:27.430
<v Speaker 1>driving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're okay.</v>

2870
02:18:28.300 --> 02:18:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're shaking.</v>

2871
02:18:29.650 --> 02:18:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Your friend's driving like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't fucking drive home drunk.</v>

2872
02:18:32.140 --> 02:18:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm so drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know he was drunk.</v>

2873
02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:35.920
<v Speaker 1>So if you get pulled over and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk,</v>

2874
02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:40.980
<v Speaker 1>hit that bottle for the splash whiskey </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your face.</v>

2875
02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:43.240
<v Speaker 1>You're hammered here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2876
02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:44.613
<v Speaker 1>He should play as play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping or just say I took acid more </v>

2877
02:18:46.931 --> 02:18:49.060
<v Speaker 1>than five times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't legally insane.</v>

2878
02:18:49.061 --> 02:18:49.894
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't drive to the real scary thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what you're talking about as far </v>

2879
02:18:53.021 --> 02:18:55.390
<v Speaker 1>as like getting in other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it shit on your record.</v>

2880
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:56.583
<v Speaker 1>This is something that when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed Aaron Frank at Singularity </v>

2881
02:19:00.630 --> 02:19:00.990
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

2882
02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:01.823
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to like think about like what </v>

2883
02:19:03.101 --> 02:19:04.870
<v Speaker 1>are the implications of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies?</v>

2884
02:19:04.871 --> 02:19:06.890
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2885
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:08.063
<v Speaker 1>the recent terrorist attack or they shot</v>
<v Speaker 1>up that people that couples shout out </v>

2886
02:19:11.051 --> 02:19:14.100
<v Speaker 1>the people and apparently even though I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think this got disproven,</v>

2887
02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Bernardino San Bernardino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were talking about how one of them</v>

2888
02:19:17.720 --> 02:19:22.090
<v Speaker 1>was a professed jihadist on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook page and they're saying,</v>

2889
02:19:22.091 --> 02:19:23.830
<v Speaker 1>well we don't check social there.</v>

2890
02:19:23.850 --> 02:19:26.860
<v Speaker 1>So whatever they've posted on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do that.</v>

2891
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:29.870
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of news stations are saying,</v>

2892
02:19:29.871 --> 02:19:31.190
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

2893
02:19:31.191 --> 02:19:32.840
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should check that.</v>

2894
02:19:33.080 --> 02:19:33.913
<v Speaker 1>You should definitely check that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at singularity university there </v>

2895
02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:42.260
<v Speaker 1>saying what happens if the society </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes so much,</v>

2896
02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:48.080
<v Speaker 1>that shit that you've posted online and </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted to doing becomes illegal.</v>

2897
02:19:48.530 --> 02:19:49.363
<v Speaker 1>What happens then when all of that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is infinitely accessible by all future </v>

2898
02:19:53.691 --> 02:19:57.080
<v Speaker 1>governments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when if like who knows?</v>

2899
02:19:57.081 --> 02:19:57.914
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the scary thing that may happen </v>

2900
02:19:59.390 --> 02:20:02.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>With mccarthy and the the ride communist</v>

02:20:02.370 --> 02:20:03.203
<v Speaker 1>shaken shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just that and that's the terrifying </v>

2902
02:20:05.481 --> 02:20:07.880
<v Speaker 1>thing and I don't want to put negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy out there.</v>

2903
02:20:07.881 --> 02:20:08.714
<v Speaker 1>I think we're all beings of love and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately everything's going to be </v>

2904
02:20:10.761 --> 02:20:11.594
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the but the one scary thing about </v>

2905
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:16.603
<v Speaker 1>when you look at like for profit or for </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit conflict and you and you look at </v>

2906
02:20:22.191 --> 02:20:23.024
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there is a benefit to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful thing happening in the United </v>

2907
02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:29.210
<v Speaker 1>States on a big scale.</v>

2908
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:34.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a monetary benefit to a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people living in the United States,</v>

2909
02:20:35.570 --> 02:20:38.930
<v Speaker 1>weapons manufacturers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislators,</v>

2910
02:20:39.080 --> 02:20:42.770
<v Speaker 1>people who are just get off on </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling other people and you realize</v>

2911
02:20:42.771 --> 02:20:46.790
<v Speaker 1>that it not only benefits them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also as a huge incentive for</v>

2912
02:20:46.791 --> 02:20:50.090
<v Speaker 1>people in other parts of the world to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create that event.</v>

2913
02:20:50.091 --> 02:20:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that all it takes is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic event.</v>

02:27:41.501 --> 02:27:43.900
<v Speaker 2>nobody tells you it's evil mean no one </v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

3064
02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:47.590
<v Speaker 2>You know what's really fucked up is </v>
<v Speaker 2>those God damn drug commercials,</v>

3065
02:27:47.770 --> 02:27:48.603
<v Speaker 2>those drug commercials where people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy and they're walking hand in hand </v>

3066
02:27:50.981 --> 02:27:54.340
<v Speaker 2>and meadows and then they start talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about explosive bloody diarrhea,</v>

3067
02:27:54.370 --> 02:27:58.930
<v Speaker 2>but they always do it in that voice that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're being trained to ignore.</v>

3068
02:27:59.190 --> 02:28:00.890
<v Speaker 2>There's that voice at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

3069
02:28:01.210 --> 02:28:02.043
<v Speaker 2>Side effects may include whenever they </v>
<v Speaker 2>me to just ignore what I'm saying and </v>

3070
02:28:05.381 --> 02:28:07.550
<v Speaker 2>watch the pretty picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Watch a pretty picture as your dog.</v>

3071
02:28:07.551 --> 02:28:08.384
<v Speaker 2>Exactly about this bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should have to show you those side </v>

3072
02:28:11.321 --> 02:28:14.530
<v Speaker 2>effects while they're doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this is hilarious,</v>

3073
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've seen this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tweeted this the other day.</v>

3074
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:21.630
<v Speaker 2>The Australia came up with this thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>called a stoner slaw and it's so stupid</v>

3075
02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:23.233
<v Speaker 3>that people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's backfiring and causing people to </v>

<v Speaker 3>smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also stoner slot.</v>

3078
02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:30.993

<v Speaker 3>actually brought all this business too </v>

<v Speaker 3>so that's a.</v>

3088
02:29:03.291 --> 02:29:04.700
<v Speaker 3>You now take the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey you off.</v>

3089
02:29:04.820 --> 02:29:06.470
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might embarrass myself here,</v>

3090
02:29:06.471 --> 02:29:09.800
<v Speaker 3>but an article I read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said it goes to a weed website.</v>

3091
02:29:10.330 --> 02:29:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I guess not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe somebody bought it.</v>

3092
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:16.580
<v Speaker 3>Who know the government social network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a stoner,</v>

3093
02:29:16.581 --> 02:29:17.414
<v Speaker 3>sloths social network.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do they think it's going to turn </v>

3094
02:29:19.090 --> 02:29:19.780
<v Speaker 3>into?</v>

3095
02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:22.250
<v Speaker 3>The next thing is going to turn to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>next facebook,</v>

3096
02:29:22.251 --> 02:29:24.260
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like a big embarrassment.</v>

3097
02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:26.990
<v Speaker 3>Let's play it because it's fucking so </v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid.</v>

3098
02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:28.670
<v Speaker 3>It's so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

3099
02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:31.430
<v Speaker 3>I haven't seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so dumb,</v>

3100
02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:34.400
<v Speaker 3>but it's like that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the thing about,</v>

3101
02:29:34.401 --> 02:29:35.234
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the talking dog commercial that we all </v>

3102
02:29:36.741 --> 02:29:38.110
<v Speaker 3>enjoyed back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3103
02:29:38.300 --> 02:29:41.840
<v Speaker 3>Those were made by our partnership for </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug free America and the fucked up part</v>

3104
02:29:41.841 --> 02:29:42.674
<v Speaker 3>about a partnership for drug free </v>
<v Speaker 3>America is they are funded by alcohol </v>

3105
02:29:44.721 --> 02:29:47.240
<v Speaker 3>and tobacco companies and pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>

3106
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:48.343
<v Speaker 3>And my joke was that's like hookers </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing commercials against strippers and </v>

3107
02:29:51.261 --> 02:29:53.960
<v Speaker 3>it really is like them doing commercials</v>
<v Speaker 3>pot.</v>

3108
02:29:54.450 --> 02:29:56.960
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're not against drugs,</v>

3109
02:29:57.140 --> 02:30:02.140
<v Speaker 3>just drugs that they don't sell here.</v>

3110
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:12.040
<v Speaker 3>Slaw in class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're worse on weed.</v>

3111
02:30:12.041 --> 02:30:12.890
<v Speaker 3>Stoner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sloth,</v>

3112
02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:17.060
<v Speaker 3>but little did the creators know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3113
02:30:17.061 --> 02:30:20.930
<v Speaker 3>I see that stoner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sloths.com.</v>

3114
02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:22.333
<v Speaker 3>Somebody put it down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is also the name of an online cannabis </v>

3115
02:30:24.921 --> 02:30:25.551
<v Speaker 3>product.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Retail.</v>

3116
02:30:25.551 --> 02:30:27.470
<v Speaker 3>It's not on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not up anymore though.</v>

3117
02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:31.400
<v Speaker 3>That's what's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if their website got crushed.</v>

3118
02:30:32.210 --> 02:30:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe stoner.</v>

3119
02:30:34.820 --> 02:30:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Sloth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3120
02:30:36.770 --> 02:30:37.603
<v Speaker 3>Well this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is something that Australia is </v>

3121
02:30:39.261 --> 02:30:40.094
<v Speaker 3>doing because they're kind of behind the</v>
<v Speaker 3>times when it comes to marijuana </v>

3122
02:30:43.191 --> 02:30:44.010
<v Speaker 3>propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

3123
02:30:44.010 --> 02:30:47.060
<v Speaker 3>They're still buying into some shit that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we thought of 15,</v>

3124
02:30:47.061 --> 02:30:50.700
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New South Wales government ads.</v>

3125
02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:53.330
<v Speaker 3>This is just so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3126
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:55.610
<v Speaker 3>so Australia will be perfect if it had </v>
<v Speaker 3>weed,</v>

3127
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:59.210
<v Speaker 3>but that's the thing about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is no perfect place.</v>

3128
02:30:59.760 --> 02:31:04.720
<v Speaker 3>You go to the most amazing jungle island</v>
<v Speaker 3>habitat and you know,</v>

3129
02:31:04.760 --> 02:31:06.590
<v Speaker 3>well you got to hang out with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking people.</v>

3130
02:31:07.660 --> 02:31:10.970
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know Australia though.</v>

3131
02:31:11.300 --> 02:31:12.800
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other than their stance,</v>

3132
02:31:12.801 --> 02:31:13.634
<v Speaker 3>I lead a Melbourne's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of my favorite places I've ever </v>

3133
02:31:16.071 --> 02:31:17.230
<v Speaker 3>been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remind me.</v>

3134
02:31:17.231 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 3>A lot of San Francisco Sorta cafe</v>

3135
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:24.240
<v Speaker 5>vibe and progressive and very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very smart people.</v>

3136
02:31:24.270 --> 02:31:25.103
<v Speaker 5>You guys should do the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went down there to do this thing </v>

3137
02:31:27.451 --> 02:31:30.930
<v Speaker 5>called the festival of dangerous ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You guys,</v>

3138
02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:33.120
<v Speaker 5>you guys would both fit right into the </v>
<v Speaker 5>vibe.</v>

3139
02:31:33.121 --> 02:31:34.290
<v Speaker 5>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You get.</v>

3140
02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:36.780
<v Speaker 5>It's like Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we might've talked about it.</v>

3141
02:31:36.781 --> 02:31:37.614
<v Speaker 5>It's like Ted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but without the sort of brand </v>

3142
02:31:39.661 --> 02:31:40.494
<v Speaker 5>protection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>paranoia and that's a great way to put </v>

3143
02:31:42.631 --> 02:31:45.150
<v Speaker 5>it down and then protection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just like,</v>

3144
02:31:45.210 --> 02:31:48.660
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just say something crazy and provocative</v>

3145
02:31:48.661 --> 02:31:49.494
<v Speaker 5>and we just want people to walk out of </v>
<v Speaker 5>here talking about whatever you say and </v>

3146
02:31:52.441 --> 02:31:53.274
<v Speaker 5>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bringing shame shape because we're not </v>

3147
02:31:55.021 --> 02:31:55.854
<v Speaker 5>getting on a fucking plane and fly </v>
<v Speaker 5>across the ocean to sound provocative </v>

3148
02:31:58.771 --> 02:32:03.180
<v Speaker 5>and your country where they do what they</v>
<v Speaker 5>do at the Sydney Opera House.</v>

3149
02:32:03.181 --> 02:32:04.790
<v Speaker 5>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3150
02:32:04.890 --> 02:32:05.723
<v Speaker 5>I played there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

3151
02:32:05.760 --> 02:32:08.190
<v Speaker 5>that's an awesome spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Sydney is awesome too.</v>

3152
02:32:08.250 --> 02:32:10.050
<v Speaker 5>I like Sydney as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like both.</v>

3153
02:32:10.140 --> 02:32:10.973
<v Speaker 5>I like Sydney,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like Melbourne was interesting because </v>

3154
02:32:13.561 --> 02:32:15.750
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the food was fucking sensational.</v>

3155
02:32:15.751 --> 02:32:17.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of that Asian market.</v>

3156
02:32:18.550 --> 02:32:19.530
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3157
02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:21.090
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you,</v>

3158
02:32:21.090 --> 02:32:23.700
<v Speaker 5>did you go up to the barrier reef and do</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the announcements?</v>

3159
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:24.663
<v Speaker 5>I didn't either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's only up there for a few days for </v>

3160
02:32:25.771 --> 02:32:26.910
<v Speaker 5>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for a,</v>

3161
02:32:26.970 --> 02:32:27.990
<v Speaker 5>had a couple shows.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3162
02:32:27.991 --> 02:32:30.090
<v Speaker 5>you were there just recently for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>lousy thing.</v>

3163
02:32:30.330 --> 02:32:33.870
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing how wrecked your brain gets</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you come back.</v>

3164
02:32:33.900 --> 02:32:38.700
<v Speaker 5>Like wrecked for days I would work out </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'd just be like,</v>

3165
02:32:39.060 --> 02:32:41.430
<v Speaker 5>where I'd normally be able to do like 10</v>
<v Speaker 5>reps of something.</v>

3166
02:32:41.431 --> 02:32:43.980
<v Speaker 5>I'd get to like six and I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

3167
02:32:43.981 --> 02:32:45.960
<v Speaker 5>I got three more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>seven,</v>

3168
02:32:45.961 --> 02:32:49.110
<v Speaker 5>fuck two more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just couldn't do it.</v>

3169
02:32:49.140 --> 02:32:54.140
<v Speaker 5>I almost couldn't do the same physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>things that I used to do.</v>

3170
02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:57.720
<v Speaker 5>I mean I could get to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but like if I was going to do 10 reps,</v>

3171
02:32:57.721 --> 02:32:59.960
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably get like nine or eight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

3172
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:01.890
<v Speaker 5>but getting to it would be way harder.</v>

3173
02:33:02.310 --> 02:33:04.860
<v Speaker 5>But just like I couldn't believe it man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And everyone's like,</v>

3174
02:33:04.861 --> 02:33:07.660
<v Speaker 5>you're going to be fucked up for about a</v>
<v Speaker 5>week from that.</v>

3175
02:33:07.661 --> 02:33:09.150
<v Speaker 5>And it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It really does.</v>

3176
02:33:09.230 --> 02:33:11.670
<v Speaker 5>Requeue does something weird to you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you just,</v>

3177
02:33:11.870 --> 02:33:16.380
<v Speaker 5>you feel like your battery is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well this Guy Dan who does all the sleep</v>

3178
02:33:16.381 --> 02:33:17.530
<v Speaker 5>research,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3179
02:33:17.550 --> 02:33:19.890
<v Speaker 5>this is his area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he's looking into why,</v>

3180
02:33:19.920 --> 02:33:24.030
<v Speaker 5>why that fucks you up so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Can you change Melatonin and you know,</v>

3181
02:33:24.031 --> 02:33:27.540
<v Speaker 5>using different medications and </v>
<v Speaker 5>different techniques.</v>

3182
02:33:27.541 --> 02:33:28.374
<v Speaker 5>He works with seals and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like hardcore guy and apparently </v>

3183
02:33:31.681 --> 02:33:32.514
<v Speaker 5>there are all these techniques that you </v>
<v Speaker 5>can do a changing your sleep cycle </v>

3184
02:33:35.131 --> 02:33:37.590
<v Speaker 5>before you go and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

3185
02:33:37.591 --> 02:33:39.210
<v Speaker 5>So you wake up at a different time and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all that.</v>

3186
02:33:39.770 --> 02:33:41.430
<v Speaker 5>It just seems like too much trouble to </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

3187
02:33:41.431 --> 02:33:43.470
<v Speaker 5>You know what they say too?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is very bizarre.</v>

3188
02:33:43.471 --> 02:33:44.304
<v Speaker 5>It's way harder to go from Australia to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the United States and it is to go from </v>

3189
02:33:47.101 --> 02:33:47.934
<v Speaker 5>the United States to Australia like </v>
<v Speaker 5>apparently that doesn't fuck up your </v>

3190
02:33:50.401 --> 02:33:53.730
<v Speaker 5>circadian rhythms as much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're going east is harder.</v>

3191
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:58.170
<v Speaker 5>We're just so weird because we want to </v>
<v Speaker 5>think of ourselves as being very simple,</v>

3192
02:33:58.320 --> 02:33:59.153
<v Speaker 5>very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very autonomous little beings that I </v>

3193
02:34:01.561 --> 02:34:03.090
<v Speaker 5>just need my food,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my vitamins,</v>

3194
02:34:03.091 --> 02:34:04.090
<v Speaker 5>and I'm normal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now.</v>

3195
02:34:04.100 --> 02:34:07.080
<v Speaker 5>You're like tied into the cycles of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>earth itself.</v>

3196
02:34:07.081 --> 02:34:07.914
<v Speaker 5>The light and dark,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the literal rising and setting of the </v>

3197
02:34:10.981 --> 02:34:15.160
<v Speaker 5>sun has a direct effect on the rhythm of</v>
<v Speaker 5>your body,</v>

3198
02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:18.460
<v Speaker 5>your biological operating</v>

3199
02:34:18.460 --> 02:34:20.560
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>falters.</v>

3200
02:34:20.650 --> 02:34:21.483
<v Speaker 2>When you throw that and it has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>readjust and set things back and think </v>

3201
02:34:24.311 --> 02:34:27.880
<v Speaker 2>about women who are menstruating with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the phases of the moon every month.</v>

3202
02:34:27.881 --> 02:34:28.714
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's my favorite one is when a bunch </v>

3203
02:34:31.391 --> 02:34:35.490
<v Speaker 2>of chicks live together and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>smelling pussies and their,</v>

3204
02:34:35.491 --> 02:34:37.930
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bodies don't even realize it,</v>

3205
02:34:37.931 --> 02:34:39.820
<v Speaker 2>but they get these coinciding menstrual </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycles.</v>

3206
02:34:40.430 --> 02:34:42.370
<v Speaker 2>How strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if that's happening,</v>

3207
02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:44.770
<v Speaker 2>what other stuff is happening that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know about,</v>

3208
02:34:44.771 --> 02:34:45.604
<v Speaker 2>like how much are humans harmonizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with each other and other ways that we </v>

3209
02:34:48.431 --> 02:34:49.264
<v Speaker 2>aren't even aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my favorite example of that is this </v>

3210
02:34:52.451 --> 02:34:53.284
<v Speaker 2>guy bruce vet weekend in Switzerland who</v>
<v Speaker 2>did research that become known as the </v>

3211
02:34:56.621 --> 02:34:57.454
<v Speaker 2>sweaty shirts study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I've talked about this </v>

3212
02:34:59.591 --> 02:35:01.630
<v Speaker 2>on the podcast before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so he.</v>

3213
02:35:01.690 --> 02:35:02.523
<v Speaker 2>He wanted to understand why women's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of smell is so much stronger than </v>

3214
02:35:06.041 --> 02:35:06.430
<v Speaker 2>men's.</v>

3215
02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:08.920
<v Speaker 2>Women can smell about seven times more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than men.</v>

3216
02:35:09.010 --> 02:35:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3217
02:35:09.760 --> 02:35:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Which is time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you come home with smelling funny,</v>

3218
02:35:12.800 --> 02:35:15.880
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sucks for them,</v>

3219
02:35:15.881 --> 02:35:19.480
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to come home smelling funny.</v>

3220
02:35:19.481 --> 02:35:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Like smelling like pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3221
02:35:21.610 --> 02:35:22.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're going to get away </v>

3222
02:35:22.901 --> 02:35:23.651
<v Speaker 2>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

3223
02:35:23.651 --> 02:35:24.484
<v Speaker 2>so he wanted to understand why is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his hypothesis was that women are </v>

3224
02:35:27.641 --> 02:35:32.080
<v Speaker 2>picking up information about men's </v>
<v Speaker 2>immune system from their pheromones,</v>

3225
02:35:32.081 --> 02:35:35.380
<v Speaker 2>from the way they smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you'll hear women often will say</v>

3226
02:35:35.381 --> 02:35:36.790
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a cool guy.</v>

3227
02:35:36.791 --> 02:35:38.020
<v Speaker 2>He's got a good job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's funny,</v>

3228
02:35:38.021 --> 02:35:40.570
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the smell smells not right.</v>

3229
02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:42.340
<v Speaker 2>It's a deal breaker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smell,</v>

3230
02:35:42.370 --> 02:35:44.740
<v Speaker 2>they'll say the smell smell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not that he smells bad,</v>

3231
02:35:44.741 --> 02:35:45.574
<v Speaker 2>it's just the smells not right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'll be a deal breaker for a lot of </v>

3232
02:35:47.801 --> 02:35:49.360
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You never hear him say that,</v>

3233
02:35:49.390 --> 02:35:49.930
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3234
02:35:49.930 --> 02:35:50.763
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you do.</v>

3235
02:35:51.040 --> 02:35:53.890
<v Speaker 2>People do smell better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like some people just smell good,</v>

3236
02:35:54.130 --> 02:35:56.350
<v Speaker 2>smell them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just want to squeeze them.</v>

3237
02:35:56.351 --> 02:35:57.760
<v Speaker 2>They smell good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3238
02:35:57.761 --> 02:36:00.790
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not talking about like perfumes </v>
<v Speaker 2>or just body.</v>

3239
02:36:00.791 --> 02:36:04.150
<v Speaker 2>I kind of a little bit offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt like perfumes,</v>

3240
02:36:04.151 --> 02:36:04.984
<v Speaker 2>a little offensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I want to know what's going on </v>

3241
02:36:06.191 --> 02:36:06.790
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3242
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a masking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your fucking smoke bomb thrown down.</v>

3243
02:36:11.380 --> 02:36:13.620
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to find out where.</v>

3244
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Where's the real you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

3245
02:36:15.800 --> 02:36:19.120
<v Speaker 2>well no one's ever smelled a woman like </v>
<v Speaker 2>a healthy woman and go,</v>

3246
02:36:19.121 --> 02:36:19.954
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish he'd fucking spray some roses on </v>

3247
02:36:21.371 --> 02:36:22.790
<v Speaker 2>this big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3248
02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:27.250
<v Speaker 2>France in the old days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a different thing,</v>

3249
02:36:27.251 --> 02:36:28.084
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with personal hygiene </v>

3250
02:36:28.601 --> 02:36:29.434
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but today when you're dealing with </v>

3251
02:36:30.701 --> 02:36:34.930
<v Speaker 2>people that take regular showers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bathe so you don't stink,</v>

3252
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:36.850
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to finish the story.</v>

3253
02:36:36.851 --> 02:36:39.730
<v Speaker 2>So check this out because this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important knowledge for people to have.</v>

3254
02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:41.170
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

3255
02:36:41.171 --> 02:36:42.004
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a bunch of guys who were deficient </v>

3256
02:36:43.660 --> 02:36:44.493
<v Speaker 2>in one part of their immune response and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then a bunch of women who were also </v>

3257
02:36:48.191 --> 02:36:50.380
<v Speaker 2>deficient in one part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the immune response,</v>

3258
02:36:50.381 --> 02:36:51.214
<v Speaker 2>it's called his immune </v>
<v Speaker 2>histocompatibility index and let's say </v>

3259
02:36:55.721 --> 02:36:56.554
<v Speaker 2>it has five elements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would find a bunch of guys who </v>

3260
02:36:58.291 --> 02:37:01.360
<v Speaker 2>are low in one or two or number three or</v>
<v Speaker 2>number four,</v>

3261
02:37:01.361 --> 02:37:02.194
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And women who had the same different </v>

3262
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:04.503
<v Speaker 2>deficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That hypothesis was that a woman who's </v>

3263
02:37:06.730 --> 02:37:11.290
<v Speaker 2>low in factor three won't be attracted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to men who are low in factor three,</v>

3264
02:37:11.291 --> 02:37:12.124
<v Speaker 2>there'll be attracted to men who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>high in factor three because then the </v>

3265
02:37:14.531 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 2>babies be healthy,</v>

3266
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:18.740
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he gets these guys to wear tee shirts</v>

3267
02:37:18.741 --> 02:37:20.900
<v Speaker 6>for three days and nights with no </v>
<v Speaker 6>deodorant,</v>

3268
02:37:20.901 --> 02:37:22.310
<v Speaker 6>no showers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no soap,</v>

3269
02:37:22.311 --> 02:37:23.144
<v Speaker 6>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then puts the tee shirts in plastic </v>

3270
02:37:24.801 --> 02:37:27.230
<v Speaker 6>bags.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then he has the women's smell,</v>

3271
02:37:27.231 --> 02:37:31.010
<v Speaker 6>the bags and mark on a piece of paper </v>
<v Speaker 6>how attractive they thought the men were</v>

3272
02:37:31.070 --> 02:37:33.320
<v Speaker 6>based only on the smell of the tee </v>
<v Speaker 6>shirts.</v>

3273
02:37:33.620 --> 02:37:36.260
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he found that with 80 percent of the</v>

3274
02:37:36.261 --> 02:37:37.094
<v Speaker 6>women they chose as he predicted that </v>
<v Speaker 6>they chose the men high and the thing </v>

3275
02:37:40.311 --> 02:37:41.144
<v Speaker 6>that they were low in and they avoided </v>
<v Speaker 6>the men who were low in the thing that </v>

3276
02:37:43.221 --> 02:37:44.054
<v Speaker 6>they were alone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in about 20 percent they seem to be </v>

3277
02:37:46.701 --> 02:37:47.534
<v Speaker 6>choosing randomly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he went back and looked at the women </v>

3278
02:37:50.391 --> 02:37:53.450
<v Speaker 6>again and found that those 20 percent </v>
<v Speaker 6>were on birth control pills,</v>

3279
02:37:54.830 --> 02:37:58.880
<v Speaker 6>birth control pill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>short circuits that response.</v>

3280
02:37:58.910 --> 02:37:59.743
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so think of how many couples who have </v>

3281
02:38:01.521 --> 02:38:05.180
<v Speaker 6>gotten together when she's on the pill </v>
<v Speaker 6>and they both,</v>

3282
02:38:05.181 --> 02:38:08.750
<v Speaker 6>like Louis Ck,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe's looking into just looking into the</v>

3283
02:38:08.751 --> 02:38:09.290
<v Speaker 6>distance.</v>

3284
02:38:09.290 --> 02:38:10.610
<v Speaker 6>Was she on the pill?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I met her.</v>

3285
02:38:11.240 --> 02:38:12.073
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I talked about this at an interview in </v>

3286
02:38:13.311 --> 02:38:15.800
<v Speaker 6>San Francisco on the pbs station down </v>
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>

3287
02:38:15.801 --> 02:38:17.510
<v Speaker 6>And as I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the guys going,</v>

3288
02:38:17.960 --> 02:38:20.240
<v Speaker 6>making the gesture like that happened to</v>
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>

3289
02:38:20.241 --> 02:38:21.620
<v Speaker 6>but be quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't say.</v>

3290
02:38:21.950 --> 02:38:23.150
<v Speaker 6>And after the interview,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>

3291
02:38:23.151 --> 02:38:24.230
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's exactly.</v>

3292
02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:27.260
<v Speaker 6>My wife went off the pill and she was </v>
<v Speaker 6>done with me.</v>

3293
02:38:27.770 --> 02:38:29.630
<v Speaker 6>She didn't want them sleeping in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>same bed.</v>

3294
02:38:29.631 --> 02:38:31.750
<v Speaker 6>She didn't want me in the same house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Suki,</v>

3295
02:38:32.350 --> 02:38:37.310
<v Speaker 6>a lot of marriages are falling apart </v>
<v Speaker 6>because they got together when the woman</v>

3296
02:38:37.311 --> 02:38:38.144
<v Speaker 6>couldn't smell,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he is compatibility and it's not his </v>

3297
02:38:40.161 --> 02:38:41.600
<v Speaker 6>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shit.</v>

3298
02:38:41.660 --> 02:38:42.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't that?</v>

3299
02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:45.500
<v Speaker 6>That's a mind blower.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it's one of these things,</v>

3300
02:38:45.501 --> 02:38:46.334
<v Speaker 6>like Dumbo was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>where we ignore these natural reflex is </v>

3301
02:38:50.180 --> 02:38:53.420
<v Speaker 6>to our detriment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We pretend we're not animals.</v>

3302
02:38:53.421 --> 02:38:54.260
<v Speaker 6>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Of course</v>

3303
02:38:54.270 --> 02:38:55.103
<v Speaker 5>we're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're just the coinciding menstrual </v>

3304
02:38:57.121 --> 02:38:57.954
<v Speaker 5>cycles alone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously there's some crazy shit going </v>

3305
02:38:59.671 --> 02:39:00.504
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that is like another level crazy </v>

3306
02:39:02.041 --> 02:39:02.874
<v Speaker 5>shit that I didn't even think about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the factors that would lead to you </v>

3307
02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:09.600
<v Speaker 5>being out of whack if your body's </v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly thinking gets pregnant.</v>

3308
02:39:09.930 --> 02:39:11.970
<v Speaker 5>And that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what the pill does.</v>

3309
02:39:12.290 --> 02:39:14.340
<v Speaker 5>It tricks your body into thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't get pregnant,</v>

3310
02:39:14.341 --> 02:39:15.210
<v Speaker 5>you already pregnant.</v>

3311
02:39:15.640 --> 02:39:19.060
<v Speaker 6>And that's why a lot of women have much </v>
<v Speaker 6>less libido when they're on the pill.</v>

3312
02:39:19.200 --> 02:39:20.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Already pregnant.</v>

3313
02:39:20.260 --> 02:39:24.280
<v Speaker 5>So I'm just really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I dated a girl and she off the pill,</v>

3314
02:39:24.281 --> 02:39:25.114
<v Speaker 5>she was so fucking Horny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then she got on the pill and it was </v>

3315
02:39:27.361 --> 02:39:30.420
<v Speaker 5>like it just stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then she got off the pill again.</v>

3316
02:39:30.421 --> 02:39:31.254
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we gotta figure out something else </v>

3317
02:39:31.801 --> 02:39:33.530
<v Speaker 5>because I don't even like sex when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 5>on the pill.</v>

3318
02:39:33.531 --> 02:39:35.160
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm totally disinterested,</v>

3319
02:39:35.790 --> 02:39:38.220
<v Speaker 5>but off the pill she was crazy horny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was.</v>

3320
02:39:38.310 --> 02:39:41.100
<v Speaker 5>It was like a switch went off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It took like two days.</v>

3321
02:39:41.250 --> 02:39:44.370
<v Speaker 5>She started taking the pills and then it</v>
<v Speaker 5>just wouldn't just shut down.</v>

3322
02:39:44.371 --> 02:39:45.204
<v Speaker 5>She would be dry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like his crate and then off the </v>

3323
02:39:47.041 --> 02:39:49.020
<v Speaker 5>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's a freak nuts.</v>

3324
02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:54.270
<v Speaker 5>That concept that there's this data </v>
<v Speaker 5>field,</v>

3325
02:39:54.271 --> 02:39:55.104
<v Speaker 5>like a chemical data field surrounding </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody makes sense that you can tune </v>

3326
02:39:58.561 --> 02:39:59.394
<v Speaker 5>into and understand aspects of like deep</v>
<v Speaker 5>aspects to know a person's like some </v>

3327
02:40:05.191 --> 02:40:09.630
<v Speaker 5>specific deficiency in their immune </v>
<v Speaker 5>system just from your nose.</v>

3328
02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:12.960
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that kind of stuff lends credence to</v>

3329
02:40:13.050 --> 02:40:13.883
<v Speaker 5>idea of telepathy or clairvoyance or </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who can read other people really </v>

3330
02:40:17.671 --> 02:40:18.504
<v Speaker 5>well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like maybe they're just somehow better </v>

3331
02:40:20.671 --> 02:40:24.030
<v Speaker 5>at detecting whatever chemical field is </v>
<v Speaker 5>around the person.</v>

3332
02:40:24.031 --> 02:40:24.864
<v Speaker 5>And can decode it in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing with like people were </v>

3333
02:40:28.141 --> 02:40:28.974
<v Speaker 5>have a whole culture of women that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking pills that trick their body and </v>

3334
02:40:32.701 --> 02:40:35.520
<v Speaker 5>did not being able to recognize the </v>
<v Speaker 5>clues of compatibility.</v>

3335
02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:36.853
<v Speaker 5>You think about how many kids are born </v>
<v Speaker 5>with health deficiencies because of </v>

3336
02:40:40.471 --> 02:40:42.000
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because people low in,</v>

3337
02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:43.273
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>number three and get together and these </v>

3338
02:40:45.541 --> 02:40:46.850
<v Speaker 5>kids have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

3339
02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:47.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's all sorts of,</v>

3340
02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:48.833
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were talking earlier about smearing </v>

3341
02:40:49.681 --> 02:40:53.130
<v Speaker 5>vaginal fluid on a newborn baby who's </v>
<v Speaker 5>born through csection.</v>

3342
02:40:53.131 --> 02:40:56.010
<v Speaker 5>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're pretending we're not animals.</v>

3343
02:40:56.310 --> 02:40:59.870
<v Speaker 5>We're pretending there's not a huge </v>
<v Speaker 5>benefit in,</v>

3344
02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:03.130
<v Speaker 5>in being contaminated with life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3345
02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:04.193
<v Speaker 5>that were these sterile creatures that </v>
<v Speaker 5>exists separate from our shit and Piss </v>

3346
02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:08.420
<v Speaker 5>in her.</v>

3347
02:41:08.420 --> 02:41:09.253
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things you realize from </v>
<v Speaker 5>grappling in Jujitsu when you start </v>

3348
02:41:12.511 --> 02:41:15.390
<v Speaker 5>getting really into it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have to keep a healthy biome?</v>

3349
02:41:15.630 --> 02:41:18.510
<v Speaker 5>You have to keep healthy skin floor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's critical.</v>

3350
02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:19.543
<v Speaker 5>Like one of the first things they tell </v>
<v Speaker 5>you when you start training is you </v>

3351
02:41:21.571 --> 02:41:24.960
<v Speaker 5>should start taking supplements like </v>
<v Speaker 5>acidophilus something,</v>

3352
02:41:24.961 --> 02:41:27.210
<v Speaker 5>probiotic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because you want to keep your skin flora</v>

3353
02:41:27.211 --> 02:41:31.340
<v Speaker 5>healthy and you want to not use </v>
<v Speaker 5>antibiotic soap like a lot of times when</v>

3354
02:41:31.341 --> 02:41:35.160
<v Speaker 5>people get infections,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the problems is they've created a</v>

3355
02:41:35.161 --> 02:41:37.440
<v Speaker 5>barren wasteland on the surface of their</v>
<v Speaker 5>skin,</v>

3356
02:41:37.650 --> 02:41:38.483
<v Speaker 5>so infections to take hold and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>treat those infections with more </v>

3357
02:41:41.401 --> 02:41:42.234
<v Speaker 5>antibiotics and you kill off all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>natural healthy like acidophilus in </v>

3358
02:41:47.310 --> 02:41:48.143
<v Speaker 5>particular is supposed to be aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards certain types of infections so </v>

3359
02:41:51.391 --> 02:41:54.120
<v Speaker 5>that like if you keep a healthy skin </v>
<v Speaker 5>flora,</v>

3360
02:41:54.300 --> 02:41:58.050
<v Speaker 5>you're less likely to get things like </v>
<v Speaker 5>ringworm or things along those lines.</v>

3361
02:41:58.170 --> 02:41:59.910
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is also what they're talking about.</v>

3362
02:41:59.911 --> 02:42:00.744
<v Speaker 5>Either this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a new kind of antibiotic </v>

3363
02:42:02.311 --> 02:42:04.110
<v Speaker 5>resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does that.</v>

3364
02:42:04.111 --> 02:42:04.944
<v Speaker 5>Can you explain that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I keep reading about it sounds </v>

3365
02:42:06.361 --> 02:42:07.560
<v Speaker 5>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

3366
02:42:07.561 --> 02:42:08.161
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3367
02:42:08.161 --> 02:42:11.010
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the pathogens are constantly mutating,</v>

3368
02:42:11.070 --> 02:42:11.903
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>In response to whatever antibiotics has </v>

3369
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:18.300
<v Speaker 5>been developed and we've come to the end</v>
<v Speaker 5>of this particular line of antibiotics.</v>

3370
02:42:18.301 --> 02:42:19.134
<v Speaker 5>So there's no more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no more variations on this </v>

3371
02:42:20.641 --> 02:42:22.620
<v Speaker 5>molecule right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>They keep tweaking it,</v>

3372
02:42:22.621 --> 02:42:25.530
<v Speaker 5>tweaking it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they've tweaked it every way,</v>

3373
02:42:25.531 --> 02:42:29.130
<v Speaker 5>every which way possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this pathogen has mutated once again</v>

3374
02:42:29.131 --> 02:42:31.590
<v Speaker 5>as we knew it would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's nothing,</v>

3375
02:42:31.950 --> 02:42:34.080
<v Speaker 5>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no response.</v>

3376
02:42:34.081 --> 02:42:38.400
<v Speaker 5>So if you get this infection,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your dad back to the 14,</v>

3377
02:42:38.401 --> 02:42:39.234
<v Speaker 5>I put this way back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it puts us back to wherever to the play </v>

3378
02:42:41.870 --> 02:42:44.940
<v Speaker 5>or whatever your arm amputated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And we had um,</v>

3379
02:42:44.990 --> 02:42:46.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rhonda Patrick,</v>

3380
02:42:46.081 --> 02:42:48.360
<v Speaker 5>have you ever listened to her?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr Rhonda Patrick.</v>

3381
02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:50.093
<v Speaker 5>She had a pretty significant Murcia </v>
<v Speaker 5>infection of staph infection that just </v>

3382
02:42:53.460 --> 02:42:55.010
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't go away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

3383
02:42:55.020 --> 02:43:00.020
<v Speaker 5>she fixed it with topical use of ground </v>
<v Speaker 5>garlic and grape seed extract.</v>

3384
02:43:01.590 --> 02:43:04.830
<v Speaker 5>The ground garlic apparently has this </v>
<v Speaker 5>radical effect on,</v>

3385
02:43:04.831 --> 02:43:05.910
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on mercer.</v>

3386
02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:09.210
<v Speaker 5>And another thing that supposedly helps </v>
<v Speaker 5>to his cannabis oil.</v>

3387
02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:11.770
<v Speaker 5>Cannabis oil is supposed to be really </v>
<v Speaker 5>good</v>

3388
02:43:12.250 --> 02:43:14.200
<v Speaker 2>at fighting off staffed staph </v>
<v Speaker 2>infections.</v>

3389
02:43:14.210 --> 02:43:15.400
<v Speaker 2>So what else is good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3390
02:43:15.401 --> 02:43:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but seawater,</v>

3391
02:43:18.450 --> 02:43:21.250
<v Speaker 2>seawater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seawater is good as my wife.</v>

3392
02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:22.293
<v Speaker 2>Irrigated wounds with seawater a lot in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mozambique and pissing on your feet </v>

3393
02:43:26.711 --> 02:43:29.710
<v Speaker 2>keeps the athlete's foot away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that weird?</v>

3394
02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were taught that in wrestling,</v>

3395
02:43:32.530 --> 02:43:33.810
<v Speaker 2>if you've got athlete's foot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pressing,</v>

3396
02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:35.950
<v Speaker 2>your feet are just pissed on your feet </v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

3397
02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:36.813
<v Speaker 2>every morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially that first pice is really </v>

3398
02:43:38.531 --> 02:43:40.780
<v Speaker 2>because it's full of uric acid </v>
<v Speaker 2>accumulated overnight,</v>

3399
02:43:41.110 --> 02:43:41.943
<v Speaker 2>just piss on your feet every morning in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shower and you just don't get </v>

3400
02:43:43.721 --> 02:43:45.790
<v Speaker 2>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why people drink their pis.</v>

3401
02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:46.773
<v Speaker 2>They would drink their first pice of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>morning because it supposedly has all </v>

3402
02:43:48.971 --> 02:43:52.780
<v Speaker 2>our vitamins and nutrients and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarre practice.</v>

3403
02:43:52.781 --> 02:43:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about that.</v>

3404
02:43:57.720 --> 02:43:58.553
<v Speaker 2>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've drank my piss a few times to </v>

3405
02:43:59.861 --> 02:44:01.450
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3406
02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:02.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably better off with like a </v>

3407
02:44:03.851 --> 02:44:04.684
<v Speaker 2>multivitamin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me if you were meant to </v>

3408
02:44:07.931 --> 02:44:10.080
<v Speaker 2>drink your pis then you wouldn't piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3409
02:44:10.081 --> 02:44:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Well your body would just send it right </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in.</v>

3410
02:44:12.370 --> 02:44:14.120
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this.</v>

3411
02:44:14.170 --> 02:44:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Why were you why your balls and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside to keep them?</v>

3412
02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:17.700
<v Speaker 2>People can kick them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3413
02:44:17.710 --> 02:44:19.400
<v Speaker 2>it's to keep them cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3414
02:44:19.420 --> 02:44:20.640
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some flaws.</v>

3415
02:44:20.940 --> 02:44:22.720
<v Speaker 2>That's the wrong metaphor for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3416
02:44:23.020 --> 02:44:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Pistons a flaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3417
02:44:26.381 --> 02:44:28.750
<v Speaker 2>If you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you would go,</v>

3418
02:44:28.900 --> 02:44:31.320
<v Speaker 2>you would dehydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if like,</v>

3419
02:44:31.330 --> 02:44:32.163
<v Speaker 2>if you never dehydrated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body would never express water in </v>

3420
02:44:35.201 --> 02:44:36.034
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you take water and you keep a </v>

3421
02:44:36.821 --> 02:44:39.400
<v Speaker 2>healthy level and it's like oil in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>

3422
02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:41.050
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your levels there,</v>

3423
02:44:41.051 --> 02:44:41.650
<v Speaker 2>you're good.</v>

3424
02:44:41.650 --> 02:44:43.600
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're like constantly getting rid of it,</v>

3425
02:44:43.750 --> 02:44:44.583
<v Speaker 2>but I guess it actually cycles through </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body and it takes impurities out </v>

3426
02:44:47.351 --> 02:44:48.184
<v Speaker 2>and actually there's a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things going on when you drink a lot of </v>

3427
02:44:49.781 --> 02:44:50.614
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why one of the things that </v>

3428
02:44:52.181 --> 02:44:53.530
<v Speaker 2>happens to people in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're dehydrated,</v>

3429
02:44:53.531 --> 02:44:58.531
<v Speaker 2>they get kidney stones and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>crystallized things in your body and you</v>

3430
02:44:58.901 --> 02:44:59.734
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to piss those out of your Dick </v>

3431
02:45:00.540 --> 02:45:01.373
<v Speaker 2>Hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

3432
02:45:01.470 --> 02:45:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I had a kidney stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We dehydrated.</v>

3433
02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:05.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This beer count.</v>

3434
02:45:06.370 --> 02:45:07.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else?</v>

3435
02:45:07.571 --> 02:45:08.510
<v Speaker 2>Diarrhetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3436
02:45:08.670 --> 02:45:09.503
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the hall's diarrhetic </v>

3437
02:45:11.381 --> 02:45:12.214
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3438
02:45:12.370 --> 02:45:14.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they say it dehydrates you.</v>

3439
02:45:14.410 --> 02:45:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3440
02:45:16.680 --> 02:45:19.900
<v Speaker 2>But here's an interesting fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that all animals pissed the</v>

3441
02:45:19.901 --> 02:45:21.940
<v Speaker 2>same amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them.</v>

3442
02:45:22.030 --> 02:45:24.250
<v Speaker 2>It's this bizarre fractal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3443
02:45:24.251 --> 02:45:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy can confirm whether as Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

3444
02:45:27.370 --> 02:45:28.121
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>

3445
02:45:28.121 --> 02:45:30.840
<v Speaker 2>call them young Jamie young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie A.</v>

3446
02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:31.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently it's like the size of the </v>

3447
02:45:33.341 --> 02:45:38.200
<v Speaker 2>bladder and the volume of the urethra </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

3448
02:45:38.420 --> 02:45:41.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like a fractal thing where it could</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a mouse or an elephant,</v>

3449
02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:42.933
<v Speaker 2>so a full piss takes the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time for an elephant as it does for a </v>

3450
02:45:45.981 --> 02:45:50.740
<v Speaker 2>mouse and elephant piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Jesus.</v>

3451
02:45:51.900 --> 02:45:54.820
<v Speaker 2>So waterfalls and drinking that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

3452
02:45:55.570 --> 02:45:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Most mammals take 20 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same with humans.</v>

3453
02:45:59.320 --> 02:46:04.210
<v Speaker 2>Not if you're drinking beer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well your bladder,</v>

3454
02:46:04.270 --> 02:46:06.390
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't matter what's in it yet,</v>

3455
02:46:06.391 --> 02:46:07.224
<v Speaker 2>but if you fully hold your pis in for </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a long time and you finally get to </v>

3456
02:46:10.521 --> 02:46:11.354
<v Speaker 2>a bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3457
02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:14.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've definitely piss along on the 22nd.</v>

3458
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:15.383
<v Speaker 2>That's really nice of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do include an image of a Beagle in case </v>

3459
02:46:19.071 --> 02:46:24.071
<v Speaker 2>you wondered what the least offensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>penis that they could find.</v>

3460
02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:28.130
<v Speaker 2>One that doesn't represent the </v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy illegal.</v>

3461
02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:31.910
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't get like a pit bull.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got racehorse in there.</v>

3462
02:46:31.911 --> 02:46:32.744
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It Will Piss pee for about as long as a </v>

3463
02:46:35.220 --> 02:46:35.550
<v Speaker 2>rhino.</v>

3464
02:46:35.550 --> 02:46:36.383
<v Speaker 2>A racehorse because people say high </v>
<v Speaker 2>pitched like a rain or I got to Piss </v>

3465
02:46:38.901 --> 02:46:41.120
<v Speaker 2>like a race horse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's talking volume.</v>

3466
02:46:41.121 --> 02:46:43.210
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen a race horse piss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good Lord.</v>

3467
02:46:43.290 --> 02:46:45.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The volume is just stunning.</v>

3468
02:46:45.150 --> 02:46:48.260
<v Speaker 2>Comes fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sti Pressure.</v>

3469
02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Wah.</v>

3470
02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:53.540
<v Speaker 2>So I'll tell you what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This kidney stone made me think there is</v>

3471
02:46:53.541 --> 02:46:57.950
<v Speaker 2>a god and he loves me or she because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a horrible thing.</v>

3472
02:46:57.980 --> 02:47:00.720
<v Speaker 2>You guys haven't had a kidney stone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like.</v>

3473
02:47:01.370 --> 02:47:02.203
<v Speaker 2>So I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I told this story on a live </v>

3474
02:47:04.191 --> 02:47:07.760
<v Speaker 2>podcast I did with you in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

3475
02:47:07.770 --> 02:47:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3476
02:47:08.841 --> 02:47:11.090
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking why am I telling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story?</v>

3477
02:47:11.540 --> 02:47:13.170
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I,</v>

3478
02:47:13.180 --> 02:47:18.180
<v Speaker 2>I woke up excruciating abdominal pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cosillo my wife who's a doctor,</v>

3479
02:47:18.231 --> 02:47:21.140
<v Speaker 2>thought I had a gas bubble in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>intestines.</v>

3480
02:47:21.141 --> 02:47:25.730
<v Speaker 2>So she had me upside down on the sofa </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a funnel stuck in my ass.</v>

3481
02:47:25.730 --> 02:47:29.570
<v Speaker 2>And she was born in Hollow Party at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Ryan.</v>

3482
02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:33.740
<v Speaker 2>She's foreign extra virgin olive oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my ass.</v>

3483
02:47:34.060 --> 02:47:34.893
<v Speaker 2>I remember laying there upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I remember thinking like </v>

3484
02:47:37.911 --> 02:47:40.160
<v Speaker 2>honeymoon was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're into marriage now,</v>

3485
02:47:40.220 --> 02:47:42.620
<v Speaker 2>this is marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3486
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:44.000
<v Speaker 2>cuz she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a doctor,</v>

3487
02:47:44.001 --> 02:47:46.070
<v Speaker 2>she's completely like the bodies of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

3488
02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:48.170
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't give a shit clinical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3489
02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:50.150
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out it was a kidney stone,</v>

3490
02:47:50.151 --> 02:47:53.300
<v Speaker 2>long story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had already gone into the two between</v>

3491
02:47:53.301 --> 02:47:56.930
<v Speaker 2>my kidney and my bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what the pain is,</v>

3492
02:47:56.931 --> 02:47:59.300
<v Speaker 2>that it's sort of scrape and it's way </v>
<v Speaker 2>down the tube,</v>

3493
02:47:59.690 --> 02:48:03.020
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't block the flow so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't having the kidney infection,</v>

3494
02:48:03.021 --> 02:48:05.300
<v Speaker 2>which people sometimes get that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

3495
02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:07.100
<v Speaker 2>What they do then they operate on you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3496
02:48:07.101 --> 02:48:10.550
<v Speaker 2>what they wanted to do is they send </v>
<v Speaker 2>sound waves in from your back,</v>

3497
02:48:10.640 --> 02:48:11.473
<v Speaker 2>from the back and the front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they calibrate it so that the waves </v>

3498
02:48:13.701 --> 02:48:15.320
<v Speaker 2>meet right where the stone is.</v>

3499
02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:16.153
<v Speaker 2>And you say the back in the front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you mean your decoding your bottom in </v>

3500
02:48:18.771 --> 02:48:19.604
<v Speaker 2>your abdomen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going from your kidney in this </v>

3501
02:48:22.041 --> 02:48:24.020
<v Speaker 2>little tube down to your bladder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3502
02:48:24.021 --> 02:48:26.610
<v Speaker 2>how do they get that sound in there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

3503
02:48:26.611 --> 02:48:27.440
<v Speaker 2>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3504
02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.960
<v Speaker 2>an x ray and find exactly where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3505
02:48:29.961 --> 02:48:32.630
<v Speaker 2>And then they have like sonogram </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>

3506
02:48:32.631 --> 02:48:34.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That are sending vibrations and and they</v>

3507
02:48:34.730 --> 02:48:35.563
<v Speaker 2>meet at the point where the stone is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the break it into sand and then you can </v>

3508
02:48:38.991 --> 02:48:40.660
<v Speaker 2>piss it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3509
02:48:40.670 --> 02:48:41.503
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But unfortunately mine had already </v>

3510
02:48:43.581 --> 02:48:47.480
<v Speaker 2>passed through the tube into my bladder </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time they got around to it.</v>

3511
02:48:47.481 --> 02:48:48.890
<v Speaker 2>So they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if it's in the bladder,</v>

3512
02:48:48.891 --> 02:48:49.724
<v Speaker 2>we can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to go in through </v>

3513
02:48:51.201 --> 02:48:52.034
<v Speaker 2>your dick with needle nose pliers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go up and grab this thing and then </v>

3514
02:48:58.371 --> 02:49:01.180
<v Speaker 2>pull it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take your awake.</v>

3515
02:49:01.181 --> 02:49:02.014
<v Speaker 2>What is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I asked and I had the meeting with </v>

3516
02:49:04.101 --> 02:49:07.100
<v Speaker 2>the anesthesiologist and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you just put me under for this?</v>

3517
02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:08.100
<v Speaker 2>I do not want</v>

3518
02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:09.250
<v Speaker 6>to be awake when someone</v>

3519
02:49:09.580 --> 02:49:11.380
<v Speaker 2>can your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

3520
02:49:11.381 --> 02:49:16.381
<v Speaker 2>see the screen behind you'll redman up </v>
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>

3521
02:49:17.740 --> 02:49:19.630
<v Speaker 6>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not into this.</v>

3522
02:49:19.631 --> 02:49:20.464
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm on the waiting list and it's </v>

3523
02:49:23.111 --> 02:49:26.030
<v Speaker 6>like any day they're going to call me </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I'm going to go in and they're going</v>

3524
02:49:26.031 --> 02:49:26.864
<v Speaker 6>to like put this thing out my dick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And meanwhile it was new year's Eve </v>

3525
02:49:31.540 --> 02:49:33.310
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] and I wake up in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>morning,</v>

3526
02:49:33.311 --> 02:49:36.370
<v Speaker 6>New Year's Day morning,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have sex,</v>

3527
02:49:36.850 --> 02:49:37.683
<v Speaker 6>I go downstairs to the bathroom and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 6>pissing in the bathroom sink because we </v>

3528
02:49:41.561 --> 02:49:44.950
<v Speaker 6>have this Asian toilet squat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>toilet.</v>

3529
02:49:44.951 --> 02:49:46.960
<v Speaker 6>So if you paste it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if I piss in that standing up,</v>

3530
02:49:46.961 --> 02:49:47.794
<v Speaker 6>it splashes all over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the deal is I piss in the sink and </v>

3531
02:49:50.520 --> 02:49:52.150
<v Speaker 6>rinse it and it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You never noticed.</v>

3532
02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:55.000
<v Speaker 6>Never noticed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm pissing down the side of the sink</v>

3533
02:49:55.360 --> 02:49:59.520
<v Speaker 6>and put outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The stone paintings,</v>

3534
02:49:59.600 --> 02:50:01.930
<v Speaker 6>how many was it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like half.</v>

3535
02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:03.190
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that a centimeter?</v>

3536
02:50:03.230 --> 02:50:04.063
<v Speaker 6>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know that about the size of your </v>

3537
02:50:05.471 --> 02:50:06.160
<v Speaker 6>fingertip?</v>

3538
02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:07.720
<v Speaker 6>It's a real rock.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like a,</v>

3539
02:50:07.721 --> 02:50:10.180
<v Speaker 6>it was like a snowflake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was a wafer.</v>

3540
02:50:10.340 --> 02:50:13.240
<v Speaker 6>A thick thicker than a snowflake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But like a wafer,</v>

3541
02:50:13.480 --> 02:50:17.620
<v Speaker 6>it just pumped out and somehow it had </v>
<v Speaker 6>gotten into the tube and the orgasm.</v>

3542
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:21.040
<v Speaker 6>The ejaculation pushed it right up to </v>
<v Speaker 6>the end of my Dick.</v>

3543
02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:22.990
<v Speaker 6>And then when I pissed it just popped </v>
<v Speaker 6>out.</v>

3544
02:50:23.020 --> 02:50:26.290
<v Speaker 6>It was no pain at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was masked by the orgasm.</v>

3545
02:50:26.350 --> 02:50:29.320
<v Speaker 6>So it looped it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looped it up and it and it,</v>

3546
02:50:29.580 --> 02:50:30.413
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>filled my head with endorphins or </v>

3547
02:50:32.141 --> 02:50:35.530
<v Speaker 6>whatever when I was having the orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I didn't feel the pain.</v>

3548
02:50:35.531 --> 02:50:37.330
<v Speaker 6>I felt like a slight burn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But like,</v>

3549
02:50:37.331 --> 02:50:39.010
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever day it was.</v>

3550
02:50:39.011 --> 02:50:41.830
<v Speaker 6>Fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's my kidney stones story.</v>

3551
02:50:41.831 --> 02:50:42.664
<v Speaker 6>So I do,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think I've looked over a cassie took </v>

3552
02:50:45.641 --> 02:50:48.810
<v Speaker 6>it to the hospital and had it analyzed </v>
<v Speaker 6>or would they say uh,</v>

3553
02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:49.853
<v Speaker 6>well they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess they can by looking at the </v>

3554
02:50:51.371 --> 02:50:54.610
<v Speaker 6>chemical composition,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can tell what causes it.</v>

3555
02:50:54.611 --> 02:50:57.610
<v Speaker 6>If it's a chronic thing or if it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>dehydration or whatever.</v>

3556
02:50:57.760 --> 02:50:59.490
<v Speaker 6>What if it was from another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bro?</v>

3557
02:51:02.080 --> 02:51:03.770
<v Speaker 6>You're pissing out million.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Rob.</v>

3558
02:51:03.800 --> 02:51:06.160
<v Speaker 6>Getting a tiny little writing on it.</v>

3559
02:51:06.240 --> 02:51:07.380
<v Speaker 2>When Doug and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing that.</v>

3560
02:51:07.410 --> 02:51:10.670
<v Speaker 2>So help me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stuck in here when Duncan and I</v>

3561
02:51:10.830 --> 02:51:13.320
<v Speaker 3>doing that silly show that Joe Rogan </v>
<v Speaker 3>questions everything show.</v>

3562
02:51:13.321 --> 02:51:14.154
<v Speaker 3>We ran into these people that do think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they have implants in their body </v>

3563
02:51:17.491 --> 02:51:21.390
<v Speaker 3>that aliens have it and they'll find </v>
<v Speaker 3>like some bizarre imperfection,</v>

3564
02:51:21.391 --> 02:51:22.224
<v Speaker 3>their skin and they'll swear that wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>there before and that there's something </v>

3565
02:51:25.171 --> 02:51:28.650
<v Speaker 3>in there and one of them was insanely </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot and we got Duncan to talk to her and</v>

3566
02:51:28.920 --> 02:51:29.760
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3567
02:51:29.761 --> 02:51:30.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

3568
02:51:30.410 --> 02:51:33.700
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3569
02:51:33.740 --> 02:51:37.110
<v Speaker 2>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good journalists.</v>

3570
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:40.090
<v Speaker 2>He was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was a ball fat,</v>

3571
02:51:42.570 --> 02:51:43.550
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

3572
02:51:43.580 --> 02:51:46.340
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that that's an alien </v>
<v Speaker 2>implant?</v>

3573
02:51:47.190 --> 02:51:50.830
<v Speaker 2>It's a scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I missed that episode.</v>

3574
02:51:50.990 --> 02:51:51.823
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're questioning my journalistic </v>

3575
02:51:52.911 --> 02:51:53.744
<v Speaker 2>integrity.</v>

3576
02:51:54.800 --> 02:51:55.633
<v Speaker 3>You were amazing when you talked to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>underground bunker guy who was going to </v>

3577
02:51:57.651 --> 02:51:59.510
<v Speaker 3>start a call now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was intense,</v>

3578
02:51:59.511 --> 02:52:00.344
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget driving around in </v>

3579
02:52:02.331 --> 02:52:03.164
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>underneath that mountain with that guy </v>

3580
02:52:04.520 --> 02:52:06.130
<v Speaker 3>was a pretty man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God</v>

3581
02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:11.160
<v Speaker 1>has an underground mountain base like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ready for the apocalypse in the space in</v>

3582
02:52:12.160 --> 02:52:14.770
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico or something where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember man.</v>

3583
02:52:14.771 --> 02:52:15.604
<v Speaker 1>I just know it's out of nowhere renting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can rent a space like a park in a </v>

3584
02:52:20.421 --> 02:52:21.254
<v Speaker 1>parking space and make your camper van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they had this like underneath this </v>

3585
02:52:24.791 --> 02:52:25.624
<v Speaker 1>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3586
02:52:25.680 --> 02:52:28.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd set up example homes that you could</v>

3587
02:52:28.331 --> 02:52:29.680
<v Speaker 1>live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this paradise.</v>

3588
02:52:29.681 --> 02:52:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And he kept saying how like there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a wine bar.</v>

3589
02:52:32.860 --> 02:52:37.860
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing he kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everyone you know is dead.</v>

3590
02:52:38.021 --> 02:52:38.854
<v Speaker 1>But there was a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was weird is that you got out of </v>

3591
02:52:42.371 --> 02:52:44.710
<v Speaker 1>him that he was kinda be going to kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of be the king.</v>

3592
02:52:44.740 --> 02:52:45.880
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3593
02:52:45.881 --> 02:52:47.560
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to be in charge man.</v>

3594
02:52:47.650 --> 02:52:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And he had set up an rv with a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of astroturf in front of it and like</v>

3595
02:52:54.161 --> 02:52:55.420
<v Speaker 1>some playground equipment.</v>

3596
02:52:55.420 --> 02:52:58.870
<v Speaker 1>So like that's what the future looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>like under there.</v>

3597
02:52:58.871 --> 02:53:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like your kids will be able to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the darkness of this massive cavern,</v>

3598
02:53:03.580 --> 02:53:04.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

3599
02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:05.613
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he kept saying how they were about </v>

3600
02:53:06.851 --> 02:53:10.240
<v Speaker 1>to have like an air tight door put in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and really,</v>

3601
02:53:10.330 --> 02:53:11.163
<v Speaker 1>really spooky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of different places like </v>

3602
02:53:12.671 --> 02:53:15.880
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of caverns that people are</v>

3603
02:53:15.881 --> 02:53:20.650
<v Speaker 1>planning on living in the progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy dig it out or did,</v>

3604
02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:21.740
<v Speaker 1>was it always those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3605
02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:25.200
<v Speaker 1>the military had used it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military dug it out there.</v>

3606
02:53:25.201 --> 02:53:28.360
<v Speaker 1>We're using it as some kind of storage </v>
<v Speaker 1>facility.</v>

3607
02:53:28.361 --> 02:53:33.361
<v Speaker 1>And so he bought it from them and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>converted it to this like this.</v>

3608
02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:34.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically dystopian future place </v>

3609
02:53:37.571 --> 02:53:40.120
<v Speaker 1>that you go through to save yourself on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bombs go off.</v>

3610
02:53:40.180 --> 02:53:41.013
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like an alien movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they just didn't tell them that </v>

3611
02:53:43.031 --> 02:53:43.864
<v Speaker 1>they're stored alien artifacts in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same location and while they're there </v>

3612
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:48.503
<v Speaker 1>that's cool.</v>

3613
02:53:48.570 --> 02:53:51.520
<v Speaker 1>It comes alive and like we have movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the corridor.</v>

3614
02:53:51.521 --> 02:53:53.680
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing in the corridor but us,</v>

3615
02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:54.633
<v Speaker 1>we've double checked and triple checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we just found this manuscript and </v>

3616
02:53:58.300 --> 02:54:02.170
<v Speaker 1>we're not sure what to make of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if that's,</v>

3617
02:54:02.580 --> 02:54:07.580
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like the movie room to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gonna see which rules a room roots.</v>

3618
02:54:07.720 --> 02:54:08.553
<v Speaker 1>It's about this woman who's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>kidnapped by this dude who locks her in </v>

3619
02:54:11.951 --> 02:54:14.410
<v Speaker 1>a room and rapes her and it's a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

3620
02:54:14.411 --> 02:54:15.244
<v Speaker 1>but she has a kid and the kid doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know there's a world outside and so she </v>

3621
02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:21.833
<v Speaker 1>and she wants a kid to be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she tells them all these stories and </v>

3622
02:54:24.401 --> 02:54:25.234
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff and the kid grows up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this garage basically thinking like </v>

3623
02:54:28.211 --> 02:54:30.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think about it.</v>

3624
02:54:30.911 --> 02:54:33.400
<v Speaker 1>That's applicable to mean talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a metaphor,</v>

3625
02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:35.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're told what reality is,</v>

3626
02:54:35.651 --> 02:54:37.210
<v Speaker 1>we're told what to believe.</v>

3627
02:54:37.220 --> 02:54:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And so matrix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all these things.</v>

3628
02:54:39.880 --> 02:54:40.713
<v Speaker 1>The Matrix gnosticism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the idea that what we are in right </v>

3629
02:54:43.931 --> 02:54:44.764
<v Speaker 1>now is actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interdimensional prison and we've </v>

3630
02:54:49.031 --> 02:54:53.560
<v Speaker 1>been trapped by these super advanced </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings that have kept us here called the</v>

3631
02:54:53.561 --> 02:54:58.480
<v Speaker 1>dark are cons and that they like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like power and authority.</v>

3632
02:54:58.481 --> 02:54:59.690
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3633
02:55:00.010 --> 02:55:02.620
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically this idea,</v>

3634
02:55:02.860 --> 02:55:03.693
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called Discordian Asm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is that because we are in </v>

3635
02:55:06.921 --> 02:55:07.754
<v Speaker 1>an interdimensional prison where we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been had reality like where we like had </v>

3636
02:55:12.861 --> 02:55:17.060
<v Speaker 1>this consensus reality given to us by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Bernays,</v>

3637
02:55:17.061 --> 02:55:17.894
<v Speaker 1>chef Bernays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who whipped up this reality tunnel that </v>

3638
02:55:19.791 --> 02:55:23.600
<v Speaker 1>we're all existing in a because we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this situation,</v>

3639
02:55:23.910 --> 02:55:24.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone in forcing the reality tunnel is </v>

3640
02:55:27.351 --> 02:55:28.184
<v Speaker 1>a servant of the dark art con.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anybody who's like trying to uphold </v>

3641
02:55:31.581 --> 02:55:32.414
<v Speaker 1>this bullshit reality that we've all </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten trapped in there actually a form </v>

3642
02:55:36.111 --> 02:55:37.070
<v Speaker 1>of Satanists.</v>

3643
02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:38.053
<v Speaker 1>And so as a religion or any time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do anything to break a ridiculous </v>

3644
02:55:44.391 --> 02:55:45.224
<v Speaker 1>rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you do anything to break a </v>

3645
02:55:46.761 --> 02:55:47.594
<v Speaker 1>mundane law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime you do anything to subvert the </v>

3646
02:55:49.851 --> 02:55:52.100
<v Speaker 1>authority of someone getting off on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their power,</v>

3647
02:55:52.370 --> 02:55:55.310
<v Speaker 1>you are actually taking part in a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of holy war.</v>

3648
02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:56.353
<v Speaker 1>And subverting this very ancient and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible prison that all humanity is </v>

3649
02:56:00.861 --> 02:56:01.694
<v Speaker 1>trapped in where people parade around as</v>
<v Speaker 1>though they have some kind of right to </v>

3650
02:56:06.051 --> 02:56:09.470
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kings being the classic case,</v>

3651
02:56:09.710 --> 02:56:10.543
<v Speaker 1>people used it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They somehow convince people that they </v>

3652
02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:16.010
<v Speaker 1>were gods on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly just human beings,</v>

3653
02:56:16.011 --> 02:56:17.810
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate liars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a god.</v>

3654
02:56:17.811 --> 02:56:18.644
<v Speaker 1>You're a human who's convinced as that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some kind of power and so </v>

3655
02:56:21.561 --> 02:56:23.720
<v Speaker 1>anytime you do anything to subvert those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3656
02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:24.793
<v Speaker 1>whether it's some fucking asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's wearing a crown and is convinced </v>

3657
02:56:27.291 --> 02:56:28.124
<v Speaker 1>you that ease the divine being sent here</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whether it's some son of a bitch and </v>

3658
02:56:32.031 --> 02:56:35.120
<v Speaker 1>one of those reality shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like going through your pockets for</v>

3659
02:56:35.121 --> 02:56:35.954
<v Speaker 1>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime you do anything to even disrupt </v>

3660
02:56:37.911 --> 02:56:42.530
<v Speaker 1>that system a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing a holy act in the great war</v>

3661
02:56:42.531 --> 02:56:46.250
<v Speaker 1>against the interdimensional prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>keepers who are keeping us trapped here.</v>
