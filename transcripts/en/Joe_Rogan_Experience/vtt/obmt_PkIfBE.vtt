1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.980
<v Speaker 2>the Joe Rogan experience your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

3
00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:11.984
<v Speaker 2>thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found out about you several years </v>

4
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:16.184
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard something about </v>

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.703
<v Speaker 2>toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sandra and I had seen a speech that </v>

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 2>you'd given on it where you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how many people have been infected</v>

7
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:29.744
<v Speaker 2>by this campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had cats my whole life and I even </v>

8
00:00:31.851 --> 00:00:32.684
<v Speaker 2>had feral cats and I've always wondered </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I should probably get tested and </v>

9
00:00:35.961 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about the result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

10
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 2>it was just fascinating to me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally,</v>

11
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:44.234
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the number that you estimate in </v>

12
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 2>Americans alone that might have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>infected?</v>

13
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.440
<v Speaker 1>It's on the order of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.633
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what the Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but worldwide it's something like 50 </v>

15
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:54.774
<v Speaker 1>percent of humans is the best guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty percent of humans wrote one thing </v>

16
00:00:58.291 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>on that scale.</v>

17
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 2>Have for people they never heard of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

18
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.263
<v Speaker 2>Would you mind explaining what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>parasite is and how it affects rats and </v>

19
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 2>cats and then people?</v>

20
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally bizarre.</v>

21
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this protozoan parasite,</v>

22
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.413
<v Speaker 1>Toxoplasma Gondii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's got one of these weird </v>

23
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:14.804
<v Speaker 1>parasitic lifestyles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only place on earth where it could </v>

24
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>reproduce sexually is in the god of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat.</v>

25
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why there are people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>know this,</v>

26
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>but so it reproduces their comes out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cat feces,</v>

27
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.053
<v Speaker 1>feces or eaten by rodents and now talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those evolutionary challenge is to get </v>

28
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:34.064
<v Speaker 1>that road and it into a cat stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what talkshow has evolved is this </v>

29
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.513
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's slowly migrates to the brain of </v>

30
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:46.871
<v Speaker 1>rodents and basically wipes out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>innate fear that rodents have of cat.</v>

31
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:53.561
<v Speaker 1>Smells like you take a lab rat who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been like the descendant of lab rats for</v>

32
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:55.094
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have never seen a cat and put like a </v>

33
00:01:57.651 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Little Puddle of Cat pee in its cage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rent's going to go on the other side</v>

34
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:01.934
<v Speaker 1>of the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hardwired instinctual aversion to </v>

35
00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:05.594
<v Speaker 1>cat pheromones and then put toxin in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rat and it loses that aversion and in </v>

36
00:02:10.641 --> 00:02:11.474
<v Speaker 1>fact it was sunset of rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They liked the smell so out in the </v>

37
00:02:15.231 --> 00:02:16.064
<v Speaker 1>natural setting that you now go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach a cat and certainly rutins </v>

38
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.930
<v Speaker 1>inside the cat's stomach and toxin was </v>
<v Speaker 1>completed its lifecycle.</v>

39
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had heard that it was a,</v>

40
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.093
<v Speaker 2>so it's a subset of rats that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually are gravitated towards it </v>

41
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 2>because I've heard it actually rewires </v>
<v Speaker 2>them sexually.</v>

42
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

43
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>that's actually work that we did in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>lab,</v>

44
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>that it basically crosses some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circuitry in the brain,</v>

45
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.213
<v Speaker 1>the hypothalamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that cat pheromones that used to be </v>

46
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:47.290
<v Speaker 1>activating every alarm circuit in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

47
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.143
<v Speaker 1>like Olympic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these rodents now instead sort of </v>

48
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:52.644
<v Speaker 1>taps into sexual arousal pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in male rats when they smelled cat </v>

49
00:02:57.661 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>pheromones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they increase testosterone production.</v>

50
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so talk,</v>

51
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 1>so has just figured out the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant way of doing it.</v>

52
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It makes cat pee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smell sexy.</v>

53
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.790
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there any understanding at all of the</v>

54
00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:12.624
<v Speaker 2>mechanism of how a parasite can figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to rewire an animals sexual </v>

55
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:20.460
<v Speaker 2>reward system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fear of predators?</v>

56
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Like how does that work?</v>

57
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something my lab spent a bunch of</v>

58
00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:27.990
<v Speaker 1>years on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out,</v>

59
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>when you look at some of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>parasites,</v>

60
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.653
<v Speaker 1>this taps into this whole world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral manipulation of hosts by </v>

61
00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:35.694
<v Speaker 1>parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And turns out they've evolved </v>

62
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.353
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably brilliant mechanisms for </v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulating hosts for their own </v>

63
00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:43.770
<v Speaker 1>benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

64
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get rabies,</v>

65
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:47.184
<v Speaker 1>you hit a rabid dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that's about is a virus that </v>

66
00:03:50.581 --> 00:03:51.414
<v Speaker 1>has affected the nervous system of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dog so that it's now rabbit and more </v>

67
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:59.610
<v Speaker 1>likely to bite somebody with viral </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles in it,</v>

68
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:00.444
<v Speaker 1>saliva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ad now passes onto the next </v>

69
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:03.384
<v Speaker 1>individual like you take 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscientists and stick them in a </v>

70
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:10.110
<v Speaker 1>convention on the neurobiology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

71
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.093
<v Speaker 1>And rabies knows more about the neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>watering of aggression than we do and </v>

72
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.920
<v Speaker 1>talk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So knows quotation marks,</v>

73
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about fear and aversion and </v>

74
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 1>the neurobiology of attraction.</v>

75
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.973
<v Speaker 1>Part of what it seems to involve his </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxo somewhere along the way has picked </v>

76
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:35.631
<v Speaker 1>up a gene that is pertinent to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dopamine system in mammals.</v>

77
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Dopa Munis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this neurotransmitter,</v>

78
00:04:38.071 --> 00:04:39.810
<v Speaker 1>it's about pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.693
<v Speaker 1>there is no protozoan parasite for </v>
<v Speaker 1>building years that's had any use for </v>

80
00:04:44.011 --> 00:04:47.370
<v Speaker 1>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's part of how toxo seems to be</v>

81
00:04:47.371 --> 00:04:51.090
<v Speaker 1>manipulating the reward system in </v>
<v Speaker 1>rodents.</v>

82
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.973
<v Speaker 1>And then couple of years ago there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper showing that in chimpanzees toxo </v>

83
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>makes you less afraid of the smell of </v>
<v Speaker 1>leopards.</v>

84
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.633
<v Speaker 1>So this appears to be a parasite that </v>
<v Speaker 1>just has evolved like this spectacular </v>

85
00:05:07.861 --> 00:05:08.694
<v Speaker 1>insight into fear circuitry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction circuitry and it's all for </v>

86
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>its own benefit to wind up in a casket.</v>

87
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.683
<v Speaker 2>So it's specifically cats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like do the chimpanzees still have </v>

88
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 2>aversions to snakes and other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can kill them?</v>

89
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.363
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.713
<v Speaker 1>And at one point in my lab was full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like all cat key and wolf pen because </v>

91
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>actually like accompany you could buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>urine from um,</v>

92
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why anyone would want it </v>
<v Speaker 1>except for us.</v>

93
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

94
00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:38.654
<v Speaker 1>so urine from actually what they use it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for is you can go spritz it around your </v>

95
00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:45.620
<v Speaker 1>garden to scare the deer away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have stuff.</v>

96
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:46.454
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where they get the urine </v>

97
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:49.274
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like from certified and all of </v>

98
00:05:52.611 --> 00:05:53.660
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.000
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's remarkably specific.</v>

100
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>So like other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have they</v>

101
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.843
<v Speaker 2>ever done tests where they chest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wolf urine or anything like that </v>

102
00:06:01.071 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>around chimps?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have any aversion to that?</v>

103
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as I know,</v>

104
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 2>the chimps study,</v>

105
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>he's only been with big cafeteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rubin studies exactly that,</v>

106
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:11.444
<v Speaker 1>showing it's a fair specificity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rodents lose a little bit of their </v>

107
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:16.634
<v Speaker 1>general skittishness a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a little bit disinhibited </v>

108
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>behaviorally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just in general,</v>

109
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>they're out more and more exploratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to get eaten.</v>

110
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.113
<v Speaker 1>But the most selective lasering effect </v>
<v Speaker 1>is they're not scared anymore of cat </v>

111
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:31.244
<v Speaker 1>pheromones.</v>

112
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.373
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's fascinating to me is that I've </v>

113
00:06:33.761 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 2>also read that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

114
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.663
<v Speaker 2>there was a disproportionate amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful soccer teams that are in </v>

115
00:06:42.101 --> 00:06:45.310
<v Speaker 2>countries with high rates of infestation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Toxoplasma.</v>

116
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one's good.</v>

117
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>That one's new to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

118
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like exactly the sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>epidemiological studies that are popping</v>

119
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:54.460
<v Speaker 1>up about humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

120
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.480
<v Speaker 1>So worry about humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

121
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>there's two branches of interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff with toxin when humans.</v>

122
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.103
<v Speaker 1>One is a literature that's been around </v>
<v Speaker 1>for quite some time showing that </v>

123
00:07:06.711 --> 00:07:10.460
<v Speaker 1>talkshow seems to increase the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>

124
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.153
<v Speaker 1>There's a higher rate of schizophrenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of individuals who have antibodies </v>

125
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>against toxo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

126
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>sometime in the past and their body was </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with it.</v>

127
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had cats growing up,</v>

128
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>whose mother had cats during pregnancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like anybody who gets pregnant knows</v>

129
00:07:31.401 --> 00:07:32.234
<v Speaker 1>you immediately get all anxious about </v>
<v Speaker 1>cat litter boxes because of possibility </v>

130
00:07:36.081 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 1>of toxoplasmosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can attack the field,</v>

131
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:40.430
<v Speaker 1>nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do all sorts of damage,</v>

132
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.700
<v Speaker 1>and a subtle version of it seems to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeper effect of increasing the risk of</v>

133
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

134
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the other realm is toxo infected humans </v>
<v Speaker 1>get subtle changes in personality,</v>

135
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 1>neuropsychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of neuropsychological profiles.</v>

136
00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.300
<v Speaker 1>They get a little bit disinhibited if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talk,</v>

137
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.143
<v Speaker 1>so infected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your more likely to die in a car </v>

138
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:07.754
<v Speaker 1>accident involving reckless speeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking to infected and </v>

139
00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>clinically depressed for the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>severity of depression,</v>

140
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to impulsively kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

141
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Now the words talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's doing something kind of similar?</v>

142
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the hardest wired,</v>

143
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>scary things in the universe out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the smell of the cat.</v>

144
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.993
<v Speaker 1>If you are human,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hurdling through space really fast </v>

145
00:08:32.541 --> 00:08:33.374
<v Speaker 1>and jumping out of windows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And toxo seems to blunt a lot of those </v>

146
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:39.290
<v Speaker 1>effects there</v>

147
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.700
<v Speaker 2>in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

148
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.740
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speech that I saw you give,</v>

149
00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:43.574
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about your time working</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a hospital and that there was a </v>

150
00:08:47.181 --> 00:08:49.490
<v Speaker 2>disproportionate amount of motorcycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>victims.</v>

151
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 2>This was actually</v>

152
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.630
<v Speaker 1>something I heard from a clinician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

153
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.503
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.990
<v Speaker 1>no hold sort of parasitology infectious </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease doctor who sort of,</v>

155
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>when I was first telling him about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the merchant toxic story,</v>

156
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:07.010
<v Speaker 1>he had like one of these bolts of memory</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

157
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.110
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember back when I was a resident,</v>

158
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:12.720
<v Speaker 1>there is this old doctor saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:16.050
<v Speaker 1>if you're ever harvesting organs from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>accident victim,</v>

160
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why,</v>

161
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>but if it's from somebody who was in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle accident,</v>

162
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.260
<v Speaker 1>make sure you check to see if they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxoplasmosis.</v>

163
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why that there's a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate of that that you find in Oregon's </v>

164
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 1>from people who were killed driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>motorcycles recklessly.</v>

165
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Totally anecdotal and equals one kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

166
00:09:38.131 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>But nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

167
00:09:39.511 --> 00:09:44.511
<v Speaker 1>this was a guy who like studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious disease and toxoplasmosis and</v>

168
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.710
<v Speaker 1>had not heard about sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral findings before and that,</v>

169
00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the recesses of his memory.</v>

170
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.850
<v Speaker 1>So what initially seemed like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

171
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:54.713
<v Speaker 1>this is a parasite that's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>selectively develop this lifecycle </v>

172
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.943
<v Speaker 1>between cat stomachs and rodent brains </v>
<v Speaker 1>and completing its lifecycle and weird </v>

173
00:10:04.981 --> 00:10:07.410
<v Speaker 1>when it gets into humans that have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral effects.</v>

174
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:08.244
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just kind of evolutionary spill </v>

175
00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:12.390
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you see if it's doing something</v>

176
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:13.224
<v Speaker 1>similar between chimps and leopards </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggesting that that lifecycle </v>

177
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.170
<v Speaker 1>manipulation has been selected for in </v>
<v Speaker 1>primates as well.</v>

178
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.693
<v Speaker 1>Very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange and for me the </v>

179
00:10:26.431 --> 00:10:27.264
<v Speaker 1>strangest thing is the certainty with </v>
<v Speaker 1>which there's a zillion viruses and </v>

180
00:10:32.491 --> 00:10:33.324
<v Speaker 1>bacteria and God knows what else out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that manipulate host behavior in </v>

181
00:10:37.681 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 1>ways we just haven't figured out yet or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we just have this right.</v>

182
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.070
<v Speaker 1>We haven't discovered that particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

183
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.933
<v Speaker 1>What does it do to women of a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact seems to have less severe effects </v>

184
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:54.480
<v Speaker 1>on neuropsychological profiles of women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

185
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:58.020
<v Speaker 1>the literature on this is pretty scanty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and humans,</v>

186
00:10:58.021 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to have some similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects but not as extreme.</v>

187
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:02.543
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story now gets a little bit more </v>

188
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:04.944
<v Speaker 1>complicated and this is actually this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabulous scientist entree vs a WHO's my </v>

189
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:12.570
<v Speaker 1>postdoc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's now a professor in Singapore who's</v>

190
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.270
<v Speaker 1>continued to study this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

191
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:16.163
<v Speaker 1>so normally one of the things animals </v>
<v Speaker 1>have evolved to be really good at is </v>

192
00:11:21.721 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 1>picking up signals that somebody else's </v>
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy,</v>

193
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:30.060
<v Speaker 1>like a potential mate is unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's sickness behavior,</v>

194
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:33.440
<v Speaker 1>there's very olfactory cues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a rodent,</v>

195
00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.293
<v Speaker 1>makes perfect sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last thing you want to do is to be </v>

196
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:39.800
<v Speaker 1>meeting with somebody who's like Branson</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious,</v>

197
00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rodent equivalence of stds.</v>

198
00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:43.463
<v Speaker 1>So normally sick animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parasite infected animals and such are </v>

199
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>detected by other rodents and avoided </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxo does something different.</v>

200
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.640
<v Speaker 1>You get a so infected male and now he </v>
<v Speaker 1>smells more attractive to female rodents</v>

201
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:03.003
<v Speaker 1>and when mating talks and gets into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sperm and can be transmitted to the </v>

202
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:08.404
<v Speaker 1>female.</v>

203
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So suddenly we've got a different story </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

204
00:12:11.711 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>We started off with the parasites to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rework.</v>

205
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:14.843
<v Speaker 1>Toxo was just ruthlessly exploiting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor rodents for its own reproductive </v>

206
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:23.750
<v Speaker 1>benefit and its own evolutionary selfish</v>
<v Speaker 1>gene wellbeing.</v>

207
00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:24.813
<v Speaker 1>The now instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got elements of instead of </v>

208
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:27.634
<v Speaker 1>parasitism symbiosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're male rat infested with toxo </v>

209
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.640
<v Speaker 1>downside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to get eaten by a cat</v>

210
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:37.713
<v Speaker 1>upside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to pass on copies of </v>

211
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>your genes by the increased sexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>

212
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:46.120
<v Speaker 1>So it might be in fact more of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>

213
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.970
<v Speaker 1>the symbiotic relationship between male </v>
<v Speaker 1>rats and talk.</v>

214
00:12:49.971 --> 00:12:53.710
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more research is needed,</v>

215
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.553
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like cool sort of biology out </v>

216
00:12:58.421 --> 00:12:58.590
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

217
00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.270
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is it,</v>

218
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.520
<v Speaker 2>is it transferred sexually with men and </v>
<v Speaker 2>women too,</v>

219
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:05.070
<v Speaker 2>as well as with rats?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

220
00:13:05.071 --> 00:13:07.320
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's been looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

221
00:13:07.321 --> 00:13:09.570
<v Speaker 2>That seems like something I would want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at right away.</v>

222
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:12.870
<v Speaker 2>What about organ donors?</v>

223
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than again,</v>

224
00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:20.890
<v Speaker 1>pure anecdotal ism that one elderly dock</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere back when saying watch it when</v>

225
00:13:21.981 --> 00:13:25.250
<v Speaker 1>you're getting organized from like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people killed in motorcycle accidents.</v>

226
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.530
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

227
00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.573
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure even tasks like say if you got </v>

228
00:13:31.311 --> 00:13:34.430
<v Speaker 1>to liver and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you needed a liver transplant,</v>

229
00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.293
<v Speaker 1>would suspect they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sort of in the clinical world of </v>

230
00:13:39.291 --> 00:13:43.160
<v Speaker 1>people who worry about Toxo toxo </v>
<v Speaker 1>pregnancy,</v>

231
00:13:43.161 --> 00:13:45.850
<v Speaker 1>scary alarms going off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toxo,</v>

232
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:48.740
<v Speaker 1>anything else after an acute period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infection,</v>

233
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.300
<v Speaker 1>you have a latent toxoplasma infection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

234
00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.350
<v Speaker 1>the agreed upon sort of notion there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxo has called latent.</v>

235
00:13:57.351 --> 00:13:58.184
<v Speaker 1>It's formed sort of these cysts that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in dirt and you've got nothing to worry </v>

236
00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:04.334
<v Speaker 1>about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the whole notion that meanwhile up </v>

237
00:14:06.441 --> 00:14:09.530
<v Speaker 1>in the nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's effects happening there.</v>

238
00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:10.723
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious disease people are thinking </v>

239
00:14:12.141 --> 00:14:16.250
<v Speaker 1>about inflammation outside in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are for them,</v>

240
00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.880
<v Speaker 1>chronic toxic infection is not something</v>
<v Speaker 1>you worry about a whole lot,</v>

241
00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:24.020
<v Speaker 1>but if it's I'm having behavioral </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects up there in the nervous system,</v>

242
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:26.660
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is something to worry about.</v>

243
00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:27.903
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

244
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:33.070
<v Speaker 2>it's to me it's unfathomable how this </v>
<v Speaker 2>little thing figures out how to hijack a</v>

245
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.803
<v Speaker 2>whole a whole body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole biological system and work it to </v>

246
00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:43.090
<v Speaker 2>its own desires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very.</v>

247
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.940
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard for me to grasp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

248
00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:49.230
<v Speaker 2>if you think of it in terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

249
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.680
<v Speaker 2>talk so has had</v>

250
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:57.700
<v Speaker 1>like 100,000 more generations to evolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>its ways of exploiting mammals.</v>

251
00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Mammals have had ways of fighting it </v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

252
00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:03.133
<v Speaker 1>What's most remarkable is turns out this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like a whole world of parasites that </v>

253
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:09.470
<v Speaker 1>do bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulative things to their host.</v>

254
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Most of it's not in the realm of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mammals.</v>

255
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:13.124
<v Speaker 1>Instead there's like some parasitic </v>
<v Speaker 1>something or other that gets into </v>

256
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:22.430
<v Speaker 1>barnacles and takes over their </v>
<v Speaker 1>reproductive system so that the barnacle</v>

257
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:26.240
<v Speaker 1>digs a hole for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Them not the barnacle,</v>

258
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 1>but the parasite to lay eggs into </v>
<v Speaker 1>theirs.</v>

259
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:31.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

260
00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.480
<v Speaker 2>the aquatic worms that infects the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grasshopper makes a commit suicide.</v>

261
00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.220
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one's a bizarre,</v>

262
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.593
<v Speaker 2>bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this wasp that gets into </v>

263
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:44.550
<v Speaker 2>cockroaches and takes him out to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

264
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm fascinated by parents sites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be beyond that.</v>

265
00:15:47.981 --> 00:15:51.550
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so confusing to me how something.</v>

266
00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:52.384
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously you're dealing with hundreds </v>

267
00:15:53.411 --> 00:15:55.240
<v Speaker 2>of thousands of generations for it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to this,</v>

268
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.743
<v Speaker 2>this current state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like how something evolves to be so </v>

269
00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:01.230
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so confusing.</v>

271
00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.280
<v Speaker 1>It's remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

272
00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:07.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to flip to the other end of the </v>

273
00:16:09.091 --> 00:16:09.924
<v Speaker 1>spectrum in terms of what like </v>
<v Speaker 1>coevolution between two different </v>

274
00:16:15.361 --> 00:16:19.440
<v Speaker 1>species can be like over the last 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

275
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.303
<v Speaker 1>Look at what we've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've taken wolves and turned them into </v>

276
00:16:22.171 --> 00:16:23.004
<v Speaker 1>these creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put Halloween costumes on and like </v>

277
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.970
<v Speaker 1>finding a couple of years ago which like</v>
<v Speaker 1>floored make this hormone oxytocin,</v>

278
00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:35.550
<v Speaker 1>which is totally trendy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxytocin is completely cool.</v>

279
00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:36.683
<v Speaker 1>Mother infant bonding is mediated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin pair bonding in monogamous </v>

280
00:16:40.591 --> 00:16:41.424
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxytocin makes you more trusting and </v>

281
00:16:43.831 --> 00:16:44.664
<v Speaker 1>expressive and generous and economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>games and oxytocin has all these pro </v>

282
00:16:49.711 --> 00:16:50.544
<v Speaker 1>social effects within a species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it turns out that this hormone </v>

283
00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:58.530
<v Speaker 1>that has spent the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I I know 100 million years,</v>

284
00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:01.620
<v Speaker 1>having mothers and infants connect to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other emotionally.</v>

285
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.550
<v Speaker 1>When you and your beloved dog sit there </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stare into each other's eyes,</v>

286
00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:13.340
<v Speaker 1>you secrete oxytocin and if you pump up </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin levels and your dog,</v>

287
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.260
<v Speaker 1>it will stare at you longer and you will</v>
<v Speaker 1>stare longer back more oxytocin.</v>

288
00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:20.483
<v Speaker 1>This is like an ancient ancient hormone </v>
<v Speaker 1>having to do with mother infant bonding </v>

289
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.960
<v Speaker 1>and in 20,000 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like a blink of an eye,</v>

290
00:17:27.961 --> 00:17:28.794
<v Speaker 1>evolutionarily suddenly we're doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird oxytocin tango thing than other </v>

291
00:17:33.121 --> 00:17:33.954
<v Speaker 1>species and other species too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We feed and take care of and they like </v>

292
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:44.580
<v Speaker 1>manipulate as wildly and to like get in </v>
<v Speaker 1>like good dessert,</v>

293
00:17:44.581 --> 00:17:45.414
<v Speaker 1>treat bones and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they in turn do all sorts of </v>

294
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.423
<v Speaker 1>wonderful stuff for our self esteem </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they like lick us </v>

295
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.860
<v Speaker 1>unconditionally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And where'd that come from?</v>

296
00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.353
<v Speaker 1>Just 20,000 years and you've like hijack</v>
<v Speaker 1>this ancient neuroendocrinology about </v>

297
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:07.700
<v Speaker 1>like parental behavior and now it's got </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with this weird symbiotic thing we</v>

298
00:18:08.101 --> 00:18:10.330
<v Speaker 1>involve as worked out somewhere back </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

299
00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:13.950
<v Speaker 1>what does it have any effect on </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendship,</v>

300
00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.590
<v Speaker 1>like a human being staring at each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

301
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.513
<v Speaker 1>Did that event anybody ever tested that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume people have looked at </v>

302
00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:24.180
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

303
00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:25.014
<v Speaker 1>it strengthens monogamous bonds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's literature by now looking at </v>

304
00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.140
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin has its effects by binding to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an oxytocin receptor.</v>

305
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 1>There's a gene for the oxytocin receptor</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes into number of variants and if you</v>

306
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:43.770
<v Speaker 1>have one particular variant that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with oxytocin and having less</v>

307
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:44.604
<v Speaker 1>effective women whom in your nervous </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that's associated with less </v>

308
00:18:48.571 --> 00:18:50.890
<v Speaker 1>stable relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

309
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this stuff is deterministic.</v>

310
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:55.194
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

311
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 1>your sex life and your romantic life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not being determined by this one gene,</v>

312
00:18:59.911 --> 00:19:00.744
<v Speaker 1>like nothing remotely resembling that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's just part of the mix in </v>

313
00:19:04.351 --> 00:19:05.970
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just wonder if that makes,</v>

314
00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:09.750
<v Speaker 1>applies to like protonic friendships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like male bonding and stuff.</v>

315
00:19:09.751 --> 00:19:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if there's like when guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>out having a good time,</v>

316
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:13.344
<v Speaker 1>if they're also getting a good juice of </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin might guess is when you have </v>

317
00:19:16.531 --> 00:19:19.430
<v Speaker 1>your basic like pathetic male associate </v>
<v Speaker 1>associativity,</v>

318
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:20.603
<v Speaker 1>which is like you talk about sports for </v>
<v Speaker 1>five minutes with some guy and as a </v>

319
00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:28.530
<v Speaker 1>result you're willing to give up your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life for him because like you know,</v>

320
00:19:28.531 --> 00:19:29.980
<v Speaker 1>this is male male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonnie.</v>

321
00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:32.570
<v Speaker 1>I bet that's got something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin.</v>

322
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made.</v>

323
00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:34.980
<v Speaker 1>It only makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

324
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 1>how many of these different factors are </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in manipulating human behavior?</v>

325
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is essentially your </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialty,</v>

326
00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:43.973
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so switching over to this part of the </v>

328
00:19:46.111 --> 00:19:47.700
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frontal cortex,</v>

329
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.460
<v Speaker 1>which is just like the coolest part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brand.</v>

330
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:52.103
<v Speaker 1>It's the most recently evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got more of it or it's more </v>

331
00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 1>complicated than us than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>species.</v>

332
00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.373
<v Speaker 1>What is the frontal cortex do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you do the harder thing when </v>

333
00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:04.470
<v Speaker 1>it's the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Selfcontrol,</v>

334
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 1>longterm planning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gratification,</v>

335
00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:10.200
<v Speaker 1>postponement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional regulation,</v>

336
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.750
<v Speaker 1>all this sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Frontal Cortex,</v>

337
00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:15.060
<v Speaker 1>it's function is totally amazing how it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does this.</v>

338
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.193
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so another way of stating that is over </v>

339
00:20:18.301 --> 00:20:19.134
<v Speaker 1>and over in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come to splits in the road where </v>

340
00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:26.490
<v Speaker 1>we've got temptations and we've got </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulses and we've got,</v>

341
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for it right now.</v>

342
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.033
<v Speaker 1>You know you want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the frontal cortex is critical at </v>

343
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:35.520
<v Speaker 1>that juncture as to whether we like do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the inane,</v>

344
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:38.550
<v Speaker 1>impulsive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self indulgent thing that we may perhaps</v>

345
00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.403
<v Speaker 1>regret for the rest of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if you tough it out and do the right </v>

346
00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.130
<v Speaker 1>and like what your frontal cortex does a</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical junctures,</v>

347
00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.670
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most consequential </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces in neurobiology.</v>

348
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.513
<v Speaker 1>We've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you asked what kind of things affect </v>

349
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.013
<v Speaker 1>how well your frontal cortex is working </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that one second where you have to </v>

350
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:02.164
<v Speaker 1>decide if that person is holding a cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone or a handgun and you pull a </v>

351
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:10.051
<v Speaker 1>trigger or in that one second where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide to you take this thing and run or</v>

352
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:12.123
<v Speaker 1>those temptations get resisted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what sort of biological things </v>

353
00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:18.310
<v Speaker 1>affect what your frontal cortex is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

354
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:22.360
<v Speaker 1>how hungry you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're hypoglycemic,</v>

355
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:23.860
<v Speaker 1>how tired you are.</v>

356
00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:24.843
<v Speaker 1>If you're in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those make the frontal cortex </v>

357
00:21:26.951 --> 00:21:31.390
<v Speaker 1>work not as well if you're a male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what your testosterone levels are at the</v>

358
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:32.224
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no surprise testosterone makes your </v>

359
00:21:33.851 --> 00:21:34.684
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortex all sluggish and stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your stress hormone levels were if </v>

360
00:21:39.161 --> 00:21:39.994
<v Speaker 1>you've been traumatized over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous five months because sustained </v>

361
00:21:42.781 --> 00:21:44.950
<v Speaker 1>stress will atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The frontal cortex.</v>

362
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.123
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

363
00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:48.790
<v Speaker 1>what versions of the number of genes </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got,</v>

364
00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:49.833
<v Speaker 1>how much stress hormones you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed to from your mother when you </v>

365
00:21:52.241 --> 00:21:53.074
<v Speaker 1>were a fetus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How must lead there was in the water </v>

366
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:56.044
<v Speaker 1>when you were a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your ancestors were nomadic </v>

367
00:21:58.301 --> 00:22:01.090
<v Speaker 1>pastoralists and developed a culture of </v>
<v Speaker 1>honor,</v>

368
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.223
<v Speaker 1>what your nutritional status was when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a kid and everything in </v>

369
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:09.280
<v Speaker 1>between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this coming down to Whoa,</v>

370
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.173
<v Speaker 1>there's just biological forces shaping </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing to an incredible </v>

371
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:15.244
<v Speaker 1>extended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the exact same story about any </v>

372
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:17.104
<v Speaker 1>other part of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is just like one of the most </v>

373
00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:20.044
<v Speaker 1>dramatic ones.</v>

374
00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.123
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a moment of agency and free will and </v>

375
00:22:23.741 --> 00:22:25.900
<v Speaker 1>volition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not I'm going to be to resist</v>

376
00:22:25.901 --> 00:22:29.920
<v Speaker 1>this temptation or not by age five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

377
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:30.963
<v Speaker 1>the kids socioeconomic status is already</v>
<v Speaker 1>a predictor of how much frontal </v>

378
00:22:34.781 --> 00:22:37.360
<v Speaker 1>development there is in this part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

379
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Because if you've been foolish enough in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country to choose the wrong parents</v>

380
00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:46.810
<v Speaker 1>to get born into there and you're being </v>
<v Speaker 1>raised in poverty on the average,</v>

381
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:50.110
<v Speaker 1>your stress hormone levels are higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as a result of that,</v>

382
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.063
<v Speaker 1>on the average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your frontal cortex is fender and not </v>

383
00:22:53.381 --> 00:22:57.430
<v Speaker 1>developing this fast and on the average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Already at age five,</v>

384
00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:01.360
<v Speaker 1>you're not as good as on average.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the hold out,</v>

385
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:03.820
<v Speaker 1>relieve me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be glad you held out for</v>

386
00:23:03.821 --> 00:23:06.520
<v Speaker 1>this longterm reward thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

387
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Now is toxo have an effect on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortex?</v>

388
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost certainly that's a hot area </v>
<v Speaker 1>of research.</v>

389
00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were originally hoping to see that.</v>

390
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:19.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks who was just going to laser in on </v>

391
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:22.384
<v Speaker 1>just some key parts of the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are absolutely essential to this </v>

392
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:28.690
<v Speaker 1>behavioral effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems to wind a more widespread.</v>

393
00:23:28.691 --> 00:23:31.840
<v Speaker 1>So that was sort of makes it a tougher </v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

394
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:32.674
<v Speaker 1>but in some ways sort of impulsive </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior is either due to a stronger </v>

395
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:40.624
<v Speaker 1>biology of impulsiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has much to do with Olympic </v>

396
00:23:44.291 --> 00:23:47.690
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The image or a weaker biology of.</v>

397
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>

398
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 1>This is such a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hold on a second is this.</v>

399
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Such a great idea is the realm of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal Cortex,</v>

400
00:23:55.671 --> 00:23:59.900
<v Speaker 1>so that could very readily be half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the equation right there.</v>

401
00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:00.803
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the frontal cortex is not fully </v>

402
00:24:02.491 --> 00:24:05.340
<v Speaker 2>online until you're what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty,</v>

403
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:07.260
<v Speaker 2>25.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

404
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.153
<v Speaker 2>it's boggling thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you just live your life like an ape </v>

405
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.410
<v Speaker 2>until you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

406
00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:16.530
<v Speaker 2>you're deep into your adulthood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're responsible for yourself for over</v>

407
00:24:16.531 --> 00:24:18.300
<v Speaker 2>seven years and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

408
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Which has some like stupefying </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications and not just for explaining</v>

409
00:24:24.851 --> 00:24:27.670
<v Speaker 1>why your freshman roommate was the week </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was.</v>

410
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Is it uniform with male women?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

411
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:31.663
<v Speaker 2>I'm female development and maturation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frontal cortex configures faster of </v>

412
00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:37.460
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the males of course,</v>

413
00:24:37.790 --> 00:24:38.623
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this very delayed maturation that </v>

414
00:24:41.421 --> 00:24:42.254
<v Speaker 2>has to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you're talking about with </v>

415
00:24:42.561 --> 00:24:45.600
<v Speaker 2>testosterone impeding it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

416
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:49.550
<v Speaker 2>seems to be a different mechanism there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just in general,</v>

417
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.443
<v Speaker 2>so brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he wants it says that testosterone </v>

418
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:55.310
<v Speaker 2>impedes it and then there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's as well.</v>

419
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:59.270
<v Speaker 2>Sure does not help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's this completely.</v>

420
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:00.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically the explanation for why </v>

421
00:25:01.691 --> 00:25:02.524
<v Speaker 1>adolescents are adolescent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a brain that's going full </v>

422
00:25:05.291 --> 00:25:06.124
<v Speaker 1>blast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the dopamine system with </v>

423
00:25:08.441 --> 00:25:09.274
<v Speaker 1>reward and sensation seeking and novelty</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking anticipation and a frontal </v>

424
00:25:14.561 --> 00:25:15.394
<v Speaker 1>cortex that's like half baked at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and is not very good at </v>

425
00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:20.284
<v Speaker 1>controlling impulses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why adolescents are the way they </v>

426
00:25:24.431 --> 00:25:25.264
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to sort of really interesting </v>

427
00:25:28.691 --> 00:25:29.524
<v Speaker 1>implications with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First one is sort of in the kind of big </v>

428
00:25:32.741 --> 00:25:37.741
<v Speaker 1>picture legal implications realm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fact that the frontal cortex is not</v>

429
00:25:38.921 --> 00:25:43.921
<v Speaker 1>fully developed until you're in your mid</v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties was implicitly the main driving</v>

430
00:25:43.961 --> 00:25:44.794
<v Speaker 1>force around the supreme court some </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago saying you can't execute </v>

431
00:25:48.101 --> 00:25:48.934
<v Speaker 1>somebody for a crime they did before age</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 and you can't put them behind bars </v>

432
00:25:53.981 --> 00:25:54.814
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of life without a chance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>parole because their frontal cortex </v>

433
00:25:59.111 --> 00:26:00.850
<v Speaker 1>isn't quite there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

434
00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:01.684
<v Speaker 1>the flaw with that thinking is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presumption that magically on the very </v>

435
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.900
<v Speaker 1>morning of your 18th birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suddenly have a spanking new frontal</v>

436
00:26:07.901 --> 00:26:12.790
<v Speaker 1>cortex that like as a memorized all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those Sunday morning sermons and can get</v>

437
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:13.624
<v Speaker 1>you to do the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least the courts have implicitly </v>

438
00:26:16.961 --> 00:26:20.950
<v Speaker 1>recognized that brain maturation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parentheses,</v>

439
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:21.843
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortex is such that adolescent </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse control is not what you see in </v>

440
00:26:26.501 --> 00:26:26.910
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>

441
00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:27.743
<v Speaker 1>It has to be judged differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other issue that sort of fascinates </v>

442
00:26:31.541 --> 00:26:33.870
<v Speaker 1>me on a neuro biological level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

443
00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:37.960
<v Speaker 1>most of your cortex is doing just fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you're three,</v>

444
00:26:37.961 --> 00:26:39.160
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years old,</v>

445
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and there's the frontal cortex taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>another 20 years to get there.</v>

446
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.033
<v Speaker 1>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is the frontal cortex just a tougher </v>

447
00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 1>construction project then the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

448
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.953
<v Speaker 1>does it have like fancy type neurons you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't see elsewhere that take amazing </v>

449
00:26:57.001 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 1>wiring or like unique neuro </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmitters?</v>

450
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:03.030
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it just like a tougher </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction project?</v>

451
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that why you get the delay and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>look closely and.</v>

452
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

453
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.293
<v Speaker 1>It's not implicitly a tougher project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get delayed from maturation </v>

454
00:27:13.171 --> 00:27:14.004
<v Speaker 1>because it's so hard to wire up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the delay because we've been </v>

455
00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:18.624
<v Speaker 1>selected to have the delay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want a frontal cortex that spends a </v>

456
00:27:23.131 --> 00:27:24.810
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time and learning.</v>

457
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.703
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How come?</v>

458
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Because by definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is the last part of the brain to</v>

459
00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:30.864
<v Speaker 1>wire up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the part of the brain that's most </v>

460
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:38.301
<v Speaker 1>sculpted by experience and environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>and least constrained by genes,</v>

461
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:44.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is the part of the brain that </v>
<v Speaker 1>does social appropriate context learning</v>

462
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's incredibly tough stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>every society,</v>

463
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:50.820
<v Speaker 1>every culture on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think about it?</v>

464
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:51.833
<v Speaker 1>Every culture on earth celebrates some </v>
<v Speaker 1>types of murder and is horrified and </v>

465
00:27:56.671 --> 00:28:00.330
<v Speaker 1>punishes other types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Song get metals,</v>

466
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.470
<v Speaker 1>some get damnation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some get like simply that one.</v>

467
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Every culture has some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>strictures against lying.</v>

468
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:08.813
<v Speaker 1>Yet in some circumstances I expect you </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have socially appropriate line in </v>

469
00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 1>certain circumstances of protection or </v>
<v Speaker 1>so on,</v>

470
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.900
<v Speaker 1>and every culture does this differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every culture has culture specific mores</v>

471
00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:26.310
<v Speaker 1>and situational ethics and things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like fancy,</v>

472
00:28:26.311 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 1>complicated stuff that takes a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to learn.</v>

473
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:31.590
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent.</v>

474
00:28:31.591 --> 00:28:32.424
<v Speaker 1>As a young adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're learning all the subtleties of </v>

475
00:28:34.231 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 1>appropriate behavior that's here from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cortex.</v>

476
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Learning not just how to get you to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right thing,</v>

477
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:41.634
<v Speaker 1>that there is a harder thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of those complexities of what </v>

478
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:45.084
<v Speaker 1>actually counts as the right thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the things that make us human </v>

479
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:53.660
<v Speaker 1>above all the other primates above all </v>
<v Speaker 1>others because we're the species that in</v>

480
00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:56.424
<v Speaker 1>some cultures can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we strongly believe in monogamy and </v>

481
00:29:00.781 --> 00:29:01.614
<v Speaker 1>build our theologies around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet at the same time have incredibly </v>

482
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:07.470
<v Speaker 1>high rates of people failing to remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>monogamous.</v>

483
00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:08.503
<v Speaker 1>You have condemned that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have cultures where like you're not </v>

484
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:15.840
<v Speaker 1>supposed to lie yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point you have to learn like,</v>

485
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to lie in a circumstance of so</v>

486
00:29:19.981 --> 00:29:22.890
<v Speaker 1>tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you harboring those refugees in your</v>

487
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:23.610
<v Speaker 1>attic?</v>

488
00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

489
00:29:24.301 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Situational ethics like that.</v>

490
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:28.643
<v Speaker 1>It takes a very strong frontal cortex to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep you for lying and certain tempting </v>

491
00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:34.683
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you've decided you're going to </v>

492
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:39.210
<v Speaker 1>lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes it from a strong frontal cortex</v>

493
00:29:39.211 --> 00:29:40.044
<v Speaker 1>to do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it effectively because you got to </v>

494
00:29:42.491 --> 00:29:46.690
<v Speaker 1>regulate your voice and your facial </v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions and where you're all his are</v>

495
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:48.490
<v Speaker 1>looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

496
00:29:48.491 --> 00:29:49.324
<v Speaker 1>so this is a part of the brain that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>got to incorporate your society's rules </v>

497
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:54.633
<v Speaker 1>as to when it's okay to lie and in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of thing that we view as </v>

498
00:29:57.251 --> 00:29:59.680
<v Speaker 1>heroic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it's not okay to lie,</v>

499
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:03.610
<v Speaker 1>but once you decide you're going to lie </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to do it effectively.</v>

500
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:04.983
<v Speaker 1>This is like complicated neurobiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't just come with a genetic </v>

501
00:30:10.031 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 1>program of wires it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be totally sculpted body and</v>

502
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:17.330
<v Speaker 1>learning all those subtleties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

503
00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:18.393
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

504
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.800
<v Speaker 2>is there another animal other than </v>
<v Speaker 2>humans that does delay?</v>

505
00:30:21.801 --> 00:30:22.634
<v Speaker 2>Reward?</v>

506
00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm mean the dopamine system,</v>

507
00:30:26.251 --> 00:30:27.084
<v Speaker 1>the reward system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interactions with the frontal </v>

508
00:30:28.441 --> 00:30:30.810
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening in a rodent.</v>

509
00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:34.080
<v Speaker 1>Like rodents could learn to master,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

510
00:30:34.081 --> 00:30:36.870
<v Speaker 1>if I press this lever once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get one reward,</v>

511
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.003
<v Speaker 1>but if I do to lever press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I work twice as hard to get three </v>

512
00:30:41.071 --> 00:30:42.330
<v Speaker 1>rewards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

513
00:30:42.331 --> 00:30:44.520
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could master that,</v>

514
00:30:44.521 --> 00:30:45.354
<v Speaker 1>monkeys can master that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just implicitly a different </v>

515
00:30:48.361 --> 00:30:49.194
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a monkey could do a delayed </v>

516
00:30:51.091 --> 00:30:51.924
<v Speaker 1>gratification task where it's got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a couple of minutes for the reward </v>

517
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:58.103
<v Speaker 1>and it's the exact same neurobiology </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve as us doing delayed </v>

518
00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:04.950
<v Speaker 1>gratification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except we do delayed gratification,</v>

519
00:31:04.951 --> 00:31:09.060
<v Speaker 1>like you study hard to get a good sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>score to get into a good college,</v>

520
00:31:09.061 --> 00:31:09.894
<v Speaker 1>to get into a good Grad school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a good job to get into the </v>

521
00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:12.324
<v Speaker 1>nursing home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your choice of delayed </v>

522
00:31:14.071 --> 00:31:14.904
<v Speaker 1>gratification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That takes 60 years depending on your </v>

523
00:31:17.191 --> 00:31:18.024
<v Speaker 1>theology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do delayed gratification where the </v>

524
00:31:20.131 --> 00:31:23.340
<v Speaker 1>rewards not gonna come supposedly until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the afterlife.</v>

525
00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.260
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

526
00:31:25.261 --> 00:31:29.280
<v Speaker 1>a monkey can have it's frontal cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do delayed gratification for it.</v>

527
00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a scale of the minutes.</v>

528
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.820
<v Speaker 1>And we'd go and we'd like to do it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>70 years.</v>

529
00:31:35.821 --> 00:31:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just in a different league in that</v>

530
00:31:38.491 --> 00:31:39.310
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>

531
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.180
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

532
00:31:40.181 --> 00:31:41.014
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially maybe even some religious </v>

533
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:45.390
<v Speaker 2>rules are some ethical guidelines that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we follow.</v>

534
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.120
<v Speaker 2>Could almost be like a scaffolding for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the frontal quarter</v>

535
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.033
<v Speaker 1>techs to absolutely the rule of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>counts as the right thing and what </v>

536
00:31:55.441 --> 00:31:59.640
<v Speaker 1>counts is the harder thing is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very culture specific.</v>

537
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:04.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's a tough neurobiological job </v>
<v Speaker 1>to master.</v>

538
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:05.543
<v Speaker 2>Do we have any idea when this was do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>said this is the most recent thing </v>

539
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.870
<v Speaker 2>developed and humans are the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>recent.</v>

540
00:32:09.871 --> 00:32:11.100
<v Speaker 2>We understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

541
00:32:11.101 --> 00:32:11.600
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>

542
00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.790
<v Speaker 1>it's the most recently evolved part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain,</v>

543
00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 1>which is to say like lizards or texts </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not much to write home about,</v>

544
00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:25.541
<v Speaker 1>but they've got like primitive cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not who you get to mammals that you</v>

545
00:32:25.551 --> 00:32:30.520
<v Speaker 1>start getting fancier cortex that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>more abstract stuff and it's not true.</v>

546
00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.850
<v Speaker 1>You get to mammals that you start seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the firsthand.</v>

547
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.080
<v Speaker 1>So frontal cortex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

548
00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:39.920
<v Speaker 1>recently evolved the last 50 to 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

549
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.813
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frontal cortex is like spanking new </v>

550
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:44.653
<v Speaker 1>and it's not until you get the primates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gave it a big frontal cortex and </v>

551
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:51.110
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly large and apes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that proportionately,</v>

552
00:32:51.111 --> 00:32:54.350
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly larger complexity </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired in us.</v>

553
00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:55.733
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you spend a lot of time studying </v>

554
00:32:56.851 --> 00:32:57.684
<v Speaker 2>baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I listened to that Radiolab podcast </v>

555
00:32:59.191 --> 00:33:01.390
<v Speaker 2>that you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where this Bob Boone,</v>

556
00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:04.470
<v Speaker 2>did you call it a troop baboon troop </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

557
00:33:04.471 --> 00:33:05.304
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was next to the place that was dumping </v>

558
00:33:07.111 --> 00:33:07.944
<v Speaker 2>human ways or human garbage and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these baboons became accustomed to </v>

559
00:33:12.361 --> 00:33:13.194
<v Speaker 2>eating this human garbage and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unprecedented change in their behavior </v>

560
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:22.460
<v Speaker 2>when the male is the dominant males got </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick from tuberculosis.</v>

561
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

562
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:26.480
<v Speaker 1>So as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dive,</v>

563
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.110
<v Speaker 1>I've been studying baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you study them by the way?</v>

564
00:33:30.111 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Like how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

565
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.383
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been 33 summers I spent out there </v>

566
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.300
<v Speaker 1>going back to a single every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

567
00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.340
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ended about eight years ago,</v>

568
00:33:40.341 --> 00:33:41.174
<v Speaker 1>but it had been essentially 33 street </v>
<v Speaker 1>summers of like you go back to the same </v>

569
00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:46.814
<v Speaker 1>animals and you'd camp under the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree and this isn't a national park in </v>

570
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:53.870
<v Speaker 1>east Africa and you go back to the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

571
00:33:53.871 --> 00:33:54.704
<v Speaker 1>And sort of the particular area I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused my work on over the years is </v>

572
00:33:58.431 --> 00:34:02.090
<v Speaker 1>stress and health and what stress does </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the brain and,</v>

573
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:06.440
<v Speaker 1>and with the baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was trying to make sense of what does</v>

574
00:34:06.441 --> 00:34:07.274
<v Speaker 1>your social rank and your personality </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your patterns of social affiliation </v>

575
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.100
<v Speaker 1>have to do with which baboons have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol levels,</v>

576
00:34:16.101 --> 00:34:18.050
<v Speaker 1>which baboons have the high blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>

577
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:19.280
<v Speaker 1>who's healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's not.</v>

578
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these are animals where you go to </v>

579
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:27.440
<v Speaker 1>your basic Jane Goodall scene of just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like watching them endlessly and knowing</v>

580
00:34:27.441 --> 00:34:30.560
<v Speaker 1>all about their personal lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in addition,</v>

581
00:34:30.561 --> 00:34:35.561
<v Speaker 1>I would dart anesthetize the baboons </v>
<v Speaker 1>using a blowgun system which was totally</v>

582
00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:37.364
<v Speaker 1>fun to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anesthetize them and when they're </v>

583
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 1>down to basically the same clinical </v>
<v Speaker 1>workup.</v>

584
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:44.540
<v Speaker 1>So you would do on a human sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

585
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.960
<v Speaker 1>as these guys immune system working this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

586
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.700
<v Speaker 1>how has it or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just working that.</v>

587
00:34:49.701 --> 00:34:50.534
<v Speaker 1>The last time I was out I had a portable</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric cardiogram machine for looking </v>

588
00:34:54.081 --> 00:34:56.480
<v Speaker 1>at cardiovascular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cardiac function and these guys.</v>

589
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.660
<v Speaker 1>So you keep them there for a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do various tests and then.</v>

590
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let him go back to their bodies and then</v>

591
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:05.930
<v Speaker 1>you have a sense of how is their bodily </v>
<v Speaker 1>function,</v>

592
00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.290
<v Speaker 1>their health or diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're stress physiology,</v>

593
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.313
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to aspects of behavior for the </v>

594
00:35:13.671 --> 00:35:14.990
<v Speaker 1>first 10 years out there.</v>

595
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.823
<v Speaker 1>I thought when I had learned was if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be a healthy baboons with a </v>

596
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:21.494
<v Speaker 1>minimal number of stress related </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and you get a choice in the </v>

597
00:35:23.931 --> 00:35:25.280
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to be high ranking.</v>

598
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:26.673
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took me about 25 years and almost </v>

599
00:35:28.761 --> 00:35:32.150
<v Speaker 1>certainly that had to do with my having </v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow up a little bit on my own,</v>

600
00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.453
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to realize that there's much more </v>

601
00:35:35.091 --> 00:35:38.570
<v Speaker 1>interesting stuff going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you got a choice between being a high</v>

602
00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:39.404
<v Speaker 1>ranking by wound or a bad thing with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of staple affiliative relationships </v>

603
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:45.810
<v Speaker 1>translated into English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends,</v>

604
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.600
<v Speaker 1>friends are gonna be even better for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your health.</v>

605
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even more protective.</v>

606
00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.630
<v Speaker 1>How often do you sit and groom with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else?</v>

607
00:35:54.631 --> 00:35:58.380
<v Speaker 1>How often you're sitting in contact?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often are you playing with infants?</v>

608
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:59.543
<v Speaker 1>Turns out that's much more of a buffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>for good health and simply what your </v>

609
00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 1>dominance rank is.</v>

610
00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:05.943
<v Speaker 2>So these baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started eating food from a resort </v>

611
00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:10.923
<v Speaker 2>and it changed their behavior to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where they were no longer getting </v>

612
00:36:14.291 --> 00:36:15.124
<v Speaker 2>up very early in foraging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They knew when the food was coming so </v>

613
00:36:17.351 --> 00:36:18.184
<v Speaker 2>they just wander down to this dump and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then they would basically essentially </v>

614
00:36:20.471 --> 00:36:23.440
<v Speaker 2>fight over dominance of the dump and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few strong,</v>

615
00:36:23.441 --> 00:36:27.040
<v Speaker 2>powerful males had control over that </v>
<v Speaker 2>until they got sick.</v>

616
00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:27.881
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

617
00:36:27.881 --> 00:36:29.320
<v Speaker 2>So this was the truth.</v>

618
00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Next word of mine that had this tourist </v>
<v Speaker 1>lodge and their territory and thus had a</v>

619
00:36:33.791 --> 00:36:37.960
<v Speaker 1>garbage dump that like national parks </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere have this issue with having a</v>

620
00:36:37.961 --> 00:36:39.760
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild animals access to.</v>

621
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:40.893
<v Speaker 1>So this garbage dump troop that you said</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take him to basically just living in </v>

622
00:36:44.711 --> 00:36:47.170
<v Speaker 1>the trees above the dump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waddled down each morning,</v>

623
00:36:47.171 --> 00:36:48.004
<v Speaker 1>just in time for the food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>junk leftovers from the lodge to be </v>

624
00:36:51.611 --> 00:36:53.440
<v Speaker 1>dumped there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

625
00:36:53.441 --> 00:36:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I did a few studies on this troop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got high cholesterol levels.</v>

626
00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:02.310
<v Speaker 1>They got borderline diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put on like subcutaneous fat.</v>

627
00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.780
<v Speaker 2>They were exactly that tooth decay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

628
00:37:07.781 --> 00:37:07.830
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

629
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.300
<v Speaker 1>got different like parasites in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stomachs.</v>

630
00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.373
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just fine living off of the the </v>

631
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:16.360
<v Speaker 1>good life they're like through now </v>
<v Speaker 1>desserts,</v>

632
00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:20.710
<v Speaker 1>this tourist lodge and in my troop a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of kilometers away,</v>

633
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how this works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some baboons way,</v>

634
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:29.790
<v Speaker 1>some of my males got word of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>feasting going on up there,</v>

635
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:35.100
<v Speaker 1>like they smelled it on a note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it evolved that in the mornings,</v>

636
00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:36.093
<v Speaker 1>about half the males from my troop would</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up and run those couple of </v>

637
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:43.390
<v Speaker 1>kilometers to go punch it out with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys there to get access to some of this</v>

638
00:37:43.391 --> 00:37:47.470
<v Speaker 1>garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key thing was that it wasn't random,</v>

639
00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:48.483
<v Speaker 1>which of my baboons would go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're a guy from like an outside </v>

640
00:37:52.631 --> 00:37:53.464
<v Speaker 1>troop and you show up at this garbage </v>
<v Speaker 1>dump and there was 80 baboons like </v>

641
00:37:55.991 --> 00:37:57.880
<v Speaker 1>feasting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're an outsider.</v>

642
00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:03.180
<v Speaker 1>No one from my troop would my dream of </v>
<v Speaker 1>going near the garbage unless he's a big</v>

643
00:38:03.251 --> 00:38:04.360
<v Speaker 1>aggressive guy.</v>

644
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.093
<v Speaker 1>The other thing is morning is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons do most of their socializing </v>

645
00:38:09.431 --> 00:38:10.264
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sit around and they groom and they </v>

646
00:38:11.201 --> 00:38:14.230
<v Speaker 1>gossip before they go out and they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>two days foraging.</v>

647
00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:18.970
<v Speaker 1>So if you're willing to pick up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead spend each morning fighting with</v>

648
00:38:18.971 --> 00:38:19.804
<v Speaker 1>strangers over garbage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you're not very socially </v>

649
00:38:22.031 --> 00:38:24.460
<v Speaker 1>affiliated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

650
00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:25.443
<v Speaker 1>the males from my troops who were going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat the garbage were the most </v>

651
00:38:28.661 --> 00:38:31.180
<v Speaker 1>aggressive least socially affiliated </v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

652
00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.553
<v Speaker 1>So this is going on for a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years and then your turns to be a </v>

653
00:38:35.561 --> 00:38:36.394
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis outbreak among the baboons </v>
<v Speaker 1>over there because there was tubercular </v>

654
00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:42.334
<v Speaker 1>meat and in the law and Shannon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meat inspector who's being bribed and </v>

655
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.500
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of par find things and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

656
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:54.730
<v Speaker 1>a human gets tuberculosis and they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit around and write thousand page novel</v>

657
00:38:54.731 --> 00:38:57.700
<v Speaker 1>some out for the next 10 years while </v>
<v Speaker 1>they slowly waste away.</v>

658
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.540
<v Speaker 1>TB kills other primates like over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course of weeks.</v>

659
00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:02.374
<v Speaker 1>It's like wildfire in nonhuman primates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an outbreak of TB from the </v>

660
00:39:06.701 --> 00:39:07.534
<v Speaker 1>infected meat in this lodge dump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it basically kills all the baboons </v>

661
00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:12.283
<v Speaker 1>and that troop and it kills all of my </v>
<v Speaker 1>baboons who had been going over there </v>

662
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:16.834
<v Speaker 1>every morning for food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what you have is half the number </v>

663
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:22.174
<v Speaker 1>of males as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you got a two to one female to male </v>

664
00:39:25.001 --> 00:39:27.480
<v Speaker 1>ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty atypical for a bag troop</v>

665
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:31.930
<v Speaker 1>and the key thing is the baboons who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>left are the nice guys.</v>

666
00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:35.290
<v Speaker 1>They're socially affiliated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the least aggressive.</v>

667
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.410
<v Speaker 1>What's by aggression about you're having</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad day,</v>

668
00:39:38.411 --> 00:39:41.170
<v Speaker 1>you find somebody smaller and weaker to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take it out on.</v>

669
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 1>They weren't dumping on weaker animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't having displaced aggression</v>

670
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.590
<v Speaker 1>and it turned into just to be technical </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

671
00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 1>like a much nicer troop.</v>

672
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.660
<v Speaker 1>They were at much higher rates of </v>
<v Speaker 1>grooming,</v>

673
00:39:55.661 --> 00:39:57.970
<v Speaker 1>less aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sitting in contact.</v>

674
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.983
<v Speaker 1>Male baboons would groom each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you don't see male baboons </v>

675
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.490
<v Speaker 1>grooming each other in this troop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would.</v>

676
00:40:03.730 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 1>So in and of itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's totally fascinating.</v>

677
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:06.544
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get rid of 50 percent of the males </v>

678
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:12.310
<v Speaker 1>who the jerks and you have a commune </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going on.</v>

679
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:13.923
<v Speaker 1>What was most interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that just flattened me was 10 </v>

680
00:40:18.041 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the troop is still like that.</v>

681
00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.413
<v Speaker 1>Ten years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the males who were there during the </v>

682
00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:26.014
<v Speaker 1>TB outbreak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who survived it and ushered in sort of </v>

683
00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.390
<v Speaker 1>the commune there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're long gone.</v>

684
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.730
<v Speaker 1>So who the new males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male baboons,</v>

685
00:40:34.731 --> 00:40:35.564
<v Speaker 1>pick up the puberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they leave their home troop and they go </v>

686
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:39.574
<v Speaker 1>wandering and joined some adult trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else and spend the rest of </v>

687
00:40:42.611 --> 00:40:44.230
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're heading up the hierarchy.</v>

688
00:40:44.231 --> 00:40:46.720
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by 10 years later,</v>

689
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:47.793
<v Speaker 1>all the males in this troop who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>still being less aggressive and more </v>

690
00:40:51.371 --> 00:40:52.204
<v Speaker 1>socially affiliated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had all grown up someplace else in </v>

691
00:40:55.421 --> 00:40:56.254
<v Speaker 1>some other true and transferred as </v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescents into this true and somehow </v>

692
00:41:00.641 --> 00:41:03.970
<v Speaker 1>or other learned even though they grew </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the normal,</v>

693
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:05.920
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad world out there,</v>

694
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:09.820
<v Speaker 1>somehow they learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't do crap like that here.</v>

695
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Cut it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

696
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And I did a ton of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of seen what that was about.</v>

697
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:21.060
<v Speaker 1>And it takes about six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once these new males show up for them,</v>

698
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.033
<v Speaker 1>they're less subject to resident males </v>
<v Speaker 1>dumping on them because there's less of </v>

699
00:41:26.771 --> 00:41:27.604
<v Speaker 1>this displacement aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Females who were getting dumped on less </v>

700
00:41:30.371 --> 00:41:31.204
<v Speaker 1>by males and thus are much more relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower stress hormone levels are more </v>

701
00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.253
<v Speaker 1>willing to be affiliated with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You some new adolescent male and you </v>

702
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:41.720
<v Speaker 1>show up in your typical baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>

703
00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:46.810
<v Speaker 1>And it's like 80 days on the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>before some female to you in this troop,</v>

704
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:47.743
<v Speaker 1>it was like three days every because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is much more relaxed because </v>

705
00:41:51.771 --> 00:41:52.604
<v Speaker 1>no one's being miserable to each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out you take a jerky </v>

706
00:41:56.031 --> 00:41:59.360
<v Speaker 1>adolescent male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because these guys were just as Jerky is</v>

707
00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:00.194
<v Speaker 1>any transfer males were to any of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring troops and like you treat </v>

708
00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:04.754
<v Speaker 1>them nicer and they kind of calmed down </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next six months and literally </v>

709
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:10.364
<v Speaker 1>what you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what social anthropologists would be </v>

710
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:17.531
<v Speaker 1>forced to define as cultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission non-genetic transmission of</v>

711
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:22.010
<v Speaker 1>a style of behavior from one generation </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the next.</v>

712
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.083
<v Speaker 1>This was culture being transmitted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a culture of high affiliation and less </v>

713
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:27.884
<v Speaker 1>aggression.</v>

714
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:30.580
<v Speaker 2>And these baboons are essentially living</v>
<v Speaker 2>a natural life.</v>

715
00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:32.370
<v Speaker 2>They're not getting food from people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

716
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.413
<v Speaker 2>They're just living</v>

717
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:38.860
<v Speaker 1>out in the Serengeti in east Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just go about normal life.</v>

718
00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.333
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was most striking about this is </v>

719
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.693
<v Speaker 1>like baboons are as high rates of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression as you find in any nonhuman </v>

720
00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.340
<v Speaker 1>primates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a male dominance,</v>

721
00:42:52.341 --> 00:42:56.360
<v Speaker 1>highly hierarchical structured societies</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the early sixties.</v>

722
00:42:56.361 --> 00:42:57.194
<v Speaker 1>They have not just metaphorically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've literally been the textbook </v>

723
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:00.583
<v Speaker 1>example of primates evolved for </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggression than male dominance and </v>

724
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.263
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and stratification and all it </v>
<v Speaker 1>took was one generation of a radically </v>

725
00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:12.553
<v Speaker 1>unique circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you see a pattern of begging </v>

726
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:17.540
<v Speaker 1>behavior that had never been seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

727
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.880
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we see in human beings,</v>

728
00:43:20.881 --> 00:43:25.740
<v Speaker 2>we see big differences in cultures in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way people are treated,</v>

729
00:43:25.741 --> 00:43:27.780
<v Speaker 2>the way women are treated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we,</v>

730
00:43:27.781 --> 00:43:29.490
<v Speaker 2>they cohabitate with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

731
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.393
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just whatever the community that they </v>

732
00:43:32.881 --> 00:43:33.714
<v Speaker 2>live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's differences in the way we </v>

733
00:43:34.501 --> 00:43:37.140
<v Speaker 2>behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with most primates,</v>

734
00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:40.530
<v Speaker 2>would you essentially say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most chimpanzees are most Benobos,</v>

735
00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.350
<v Speaker 2>that you can kind of uniformly say </v>
<v Speaker 2>Benobos,</v>

736
00:43:43.351 --> 00:43:44.580
<v Speaker 2>behave this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chimpanzees,</v>

737
00:43:44.581 --> 00:43:45.414
<v Speaker 2>behave this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this the only time you've ever seen </v>

738
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.690
<v Speaker 2>like a complete variation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard behavior of a primate?</v>

739
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:53.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I know,</v>

740
00:43:53.371 --> 00:43:54.204
<v Speaker 1>this is the only example of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this that's been seen but other </v>

741
00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:03.780
<v Speaker 1>ecological extremes and you get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical shifts.</v>

742
00:44:03.781 --> 00:44:04.614
<v Speaker 1>But in lots of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the biggest cultural shift that </v>

743
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:11.040
<v Speaker 1>anyone has seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sort of the social model,</v>

744
00:44:11.041 --> 00:44:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you have a bathroom trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

745
00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:14.783
<v Speaker 1>and for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the biggest take home message of </v>

746
00:44:16.351 --> 00:44:20.010
<v Speaker 1>that is exactly what you just honed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>on who these guys are,</v>

747
00:44:20.011 --> 00:44:24.090
<v Speaker 1>textbook examples of the inevitability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stratification and aggression and all</v>

748
00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:25.253
<v Speaker 1>and know it turns out it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitable that can suddenly flip with </v>

749
00:44:28.831 --> 00:44:33.120
<v Speaker 1>some like unique circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be transmitted multi-generationally.</v>

750
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.403
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who could look at humans and say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are certain inevitabilities </v>

751
00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.160
<v Speaker 1>to some of the most unpalatable things </v>
<v Speaker 1>we do.</v>

752
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.233
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a leg to stand on if at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Boone's have the behavioral sort of </v>

753
00:44:45.691 --> 00:44:50.691
<v Speaker 1>flexibility and plasticity built into </v>
<v Speaker 1>them just lurking for a unique situation</v>

754
00:44:51.061 --> 00:44:51.894
<v Speaker 1>like this and suddenly six months of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different cultural style and you adopt </v>

755
00:44:56.721 --> 00:44:57.554
<v Speaker 1>it and pass it on a can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a leg to stand on to say </v>

756
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:02.274
<v Speaker 1>that certain of the worst things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>human culture and behavior is </v>

757
00:45:04.741 --> 00:45:05.574
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>

758
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.910
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we vary so wildly from continent to</v>

759
00:45:09.911 --> 00:45:12.040
<v Speaker 2>continent that we've kind of gotten used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

760
00:45:12.041 --> 00:45:12.874
<v Speaker 2>but to see it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in another kind of primate and to see </v>

761
00:45:16.091 --> 00:45:19.510
<v Speaker 2>that circumstances can change the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>they behave.</v>

762
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:20.463
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and literally change their entire </v>

763
00:45:21.671 --> 00:45:22.504
<v Speaker 2>community to the point where decades </v>
<v Speaker 2>later and it's like 20 years later </v>

764
00:45:25.301 --> 00:45:26.260
<v Speaker 2>they're still the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

765
00:45:26.261 --> 00:45:27.460
<v Speaker 2>Is that the case?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

766
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:31.660
<v Speaker 2>the culture there went for about 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and is it,</v>

767
00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:32.643
<v Speaker 2>does it dissolve now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it involve back to normal baboons </v>

768
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.500
<v Speaker 2>behavior?</v>

769
00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.333
<v Speaker 1>Originally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it basically ended when the troops sort </v>

770
00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:41.704
<v Speaker 1>of moved into the vacuum created by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>TB outbreak and moved into the lodge </v>

771
00:45:46.811 --> 00:45:49.490
<v Speaker 1>area and they kind of disintegrated as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

772
00:45:49.491 --> 00:45:53.950
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them got habituated enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the humans there to represent the danger</v>

773
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:56.380
<v Speaker 1>game park rangers had to kill about half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>

774
00:45:56.680 --> 00:46:00.430
<v Speaker 1>so the troop basically does not exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

775
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.360
<v Speaker 2>but for about 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

776
00:46:03.361 --> 00:46:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that give you hope when it comes to</v>

777
00:46:05.401 --> 00:46:06.234
<v Speaker 2>human beings because it seems like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a radical shift or the behavior of </v>

778
00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:14.820
<v Speaker 2>a primate without a language that to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>see that that's possible,</v>

779
00:46:15.941 --> 00:46:19.590
<v Speaker 2>that just a shift of circumstance can </v>
<v Speaker 2>change the entire behavior pattern.</v>

780
00:46:19.591 --> 00:46:19.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

781
00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:20.740
<v Speaker 1>His troop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

782
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

783
00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:27.010
<v Speaker 1>the take home messages to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to usher in rural piece with humans just</v>

784
00:46:27.011 --> 00:46:27.844
<v Speaker 1>like go give tb to males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I guess that's not the sort of most </v>

785
00:46:32.591 --> 00:46:37.591
<v Speaker 1>obvious take home message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean you look at humans change.</v>

786
00:46:37.931 --> 00:46:38.764
<v Speaker 1>Human cultures change the 17th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the most terrifying people in </v>

787
00:46:42.641 --> 00:46:43.474
<v Speaker 1>Europe or the Swedes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spent the whole century rampaging </v>

788
00:46:45.731 --> 00:46:49.600
<v Speaker 1>through Europe and they've now gone more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than 200 years since they've had a war.</v>

789
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.050
<v Speaker 1>World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas trees in 1914.</v>

790
00:46:53.051 --> 00:46:53.884
<v Speaker 1>All it took was about four hours of </v>
<v Speaker 1>British and German troops fraternizing </v>

791
00:46:57.701 --> 00:46:58.534
<v Speaker 1>from across the lines while they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly doing nothing more than </v>

792
00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.673
<v Speaker 1>retrieving dead bodies from no man's </v>
<v Speaker 1>land between the trenches and before it </v>

793
00:47:06.431 --> 00:47:07.264
<v Speaker 1>was over with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were praying together and having </v>

794
00:47:08.981 --> 00:47:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Christmas dinner together and playing </v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer together and exchanging addresses</v>

795
00:47:12.731 --> 00:47:13.564
<v Speaker 1>to meet after the war and were they held</v>
<v Speaker 1>out for days at some of those points </v>

796
00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:18.634
<v Speaker 1>until officers had to show up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened to shoot these guys unless </v>

797
00:47:21.341 --> 00:47:22.960
<v Speaker 1>they went back to trying to kill each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

798
00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:24.843
<v Speaker 1>Change can occur very dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these days there's an entire </v>

799
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:34.680
<v Speaker 1>agencies that devote a are devoted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam veterans going to Vietnam,</v>

800
00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:41.950
<v Speaker 1>going back for reconciliation ceremonies</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going back to,</v>

801
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations that literally build bridges</v>

802
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 1>across the rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping schools,</v>

803
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:54.610
<v Speaker 1>all of the what of that could have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>conceived of like 1970.</v>

804
00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans have an astonishing capacity to </v>

805
00:47:57.791 --> 00:47:58.624
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

806
00:47:58.900 --> 00:47:59.733
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so fascinating when you consider </v>

807
00:48:01.481 --> 00:48:06.310
<v Speaker 2>all of the variables that cause a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be who they are,</v>

808
00:48:06.311 --> 00:48:07.144
<v Speaker 2>to behave who they are and then them </v>
<v Speaker 2>interacting with all these other people </v>

809
00:48:10.211 --> 00:48:11.044
<v Speaker 2>who share variables and have unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>variables and that there's just so many </v>

810
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:18.760
<v Speaker 2>different factors in what makes a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community a city,</v>

811
00:48:18.761 --> 00:48:19.594
<v Speaker 2>a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty mindboggling would consider </v>

812
00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 2>all the variables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's utterly</v>

813
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:25.913
<v Speaker 1>boggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just to really get sort of </v>

814
00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:32.050
<v Speaker 1>provocative or at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

815
00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:33.053
<v Speaker 1>what one does with all that complexity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and with all the biology we haven't </v>

816
00:48:37.531 --> 00:48:38.364
<v Speaker 1>discovered yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all those gaping sort of holes of </v>

817
00:48:41.161 --> 00:48:43.560
<v Speaker 1>explanation as to where that behavior </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from.</v>

818
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.790
<v Speaker 1>This thing we call a freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

819
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.450
<v Speaker 1>All free will is the biology we haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered yet.</v>

820
00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:53.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sam Harris broke my brain talking about </v>

821
00:48:56.041 --> 00:48:56.874
<v Speaker 2>threewill once where I really believed </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was real until he started explaining </v>

822
00:48:59.401 --> 00:49:02.520
<v Speaker 2>to me determinism and all the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>variables and yeah,</v>

823
00:49:02.521 --> 00:49:03.354
<v Speaker 2>I mean do you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a little bit of something that </v>

824
00:49:04.801 --> 00:49:07.980
<v Speaker 2>we have where you're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>frontal cortex that allows you to resist</v>

825
00:49:07.981 --> 00:49:10.670
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like why is yours the way it is?</v>

826
00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:11.370
<v Speaker 2>Question,</v>

827
00:49:11.370 --> 00:49:12.203
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

828
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:17.210
<v Speaker 1>and if get some of it had to do with how</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressed or mothered was when you were a</v>

829
00:49:18.341 --> 00:49:23.100
<v Speaker 1>fetus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how are okay,</v>

830
00:49:23.101 --> 00:49:28.101
<v Speaker 1>like here's a just on the level of sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sensory stuff going on.</v>

831
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Just the sensory cues we're getting into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and how that's influencing our</v>

832
00:49:33.841 --> 00:49:34.674
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put up a pair of all his upholstered </v>

833
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:38.273
<v Speaker 1>with just showing a pair of eyes on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bus stop and people litter less display </v>

834
00:49:43.561 --> 00:49:44.394
<v Speaker 1>a pair of eyes on a computer screen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people become more generous and online </v>

835
00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:51.570
<v Speaker 1>economic games because it's tapping </v>
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

836
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:52.923
<v Speaker 1>I'm being watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick somebody in a room with smelly </v>

837
00:49:55.651 --> 00:49:59.490
<v Speaker 1>garbage and they become more socially </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative on questionnaires.</v>

838
00:49:59.491 --> 00:50:00.324
<v Speaker 1>They're filling out because something </v>
<v Speaker 1>just feels this really disgusting and </v>

839
00:50:05.311 --> 00:50:06.144
<v Speaker 1>that biases us towards deciding that </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's different is different </v>

840
00:50:09.811 --> 00:50:10.644
<v Speaker 1>than wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't become more conservative </v>

841
00:50:12.571 --> 00:50:15.300
<v Speaker 1>about economic issues or geopolitical </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

842
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.373
<v Speaker 1>They're just more likely to decide that </v>
<v Speaker 1>them's who do something different from </v>

843
00:50:20.101 --> 00:50:21.480
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just different,</v>

844
00:50:21.481 --> 00:50:22.314
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong because something just feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of disgusting because they're </v>

845
00:50:26.451 --> 00:50:27.284
<v Speaker 1>smelly in a room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One very influential study looking at </v>

846
00:50:30.351 --> 00:50:31.184
<v Speaker 1>5,000 judicial decisions over the course</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a year and a parole board system and </v>

847
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.823
<v Speaker 1>the single biggest predictor of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision a judge who was going to make </v>

848
00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:40.634
<v Speaker 1>if they gave somebody parole or sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>them back to the slammer was how many </v>

849
00:50:44.241 --> 00:50:46.880
<v Speaker 1>hours it had been since the judge had </v>
<v Speaker 1>eaten a meal.</v>

850
00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:52.430
<v Speaker 1>Because when you got hired glucose </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels in your bloodstream,</v>

851
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:53.473
<v Speaker 1>your frontal cortex works better because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real expensive part of the brain </v>

852
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.660
<v Speaker 1>and when you're hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel less sympathy.</v>

853
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:02.930
<v Speaker 1>You feel less empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People become less generous and economic</v>

854
00:51:02.931 --> 00:51:03.764
<v Speaker 1>games and how much would you contribute </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this and what sort of a judge has to </v>

855
00:51:08.421 --> 00:51:08.660
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

856
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:09.493
<v Speaker 1>They're in a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anytime we judge is do this difficult </v>

857
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:13.103
<v Speaker 1>frontal task of trying to view the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>from somebody else's perspective and </v>

858
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.600
<v Speaker 1>they're hyperglycemic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't eaten in four hours and it's</v>

859
00:51:20.601 --> 00:51:23.240
<v Speaker 1>more likely that your frontal cortex in </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect is going to say,</v>

860
00:51:23.241 --> 00:51:24.890
<v Speaker 1>screw that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too hard.</v>

861
00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:26.990
<v Speaker 1>The guy's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and send them back to jail.</v>

862
00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:28.403
<v Speaker 1>What's most amazing is if you had gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those judges two seconds after </v>

863
00:51:31.581 --> 00:51:32.414
<v Speaker 1>they made that decision that could most </v>
<v Speaker 1>be predicted by the effects of glucose </v>

864
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:40.550
<v Speaker 1>on the brain metabolism and asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why do you make that decision?</v>

865
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:41.384
<v Speaker 1>And they're going to be quoting like </v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment age philosophers or </v>

866
00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:45.734
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just like rationalization </v>

867
00:51:48.741 --> 00:51:49.574
<v Speaker 1>running to catch up with the biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just rumbling underneath the </v>

868
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:55.970
<v Speaker 1>surface there and influencing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

869
00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:57.013
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like maybe one of the best ways we </v>

870
00:52:01.311 --> 00:52:04.490
<v Speaker 2>can enhance society is keep people well </v>
<v Speaker 2>fed and lower stress.</v>

871
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

872
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:08.503
<v Speaker 1>if nothing else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what people have known for decades </v>

873
00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:15.140
<v Speaker 1>when we're stressed or like learning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory doesn't work that well,</v>

874
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:16.663
<v Speaker 1>then people learned were more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be anxious and learn to be afraid of </v>

875
00:52:20.061 --> 00:52:20.894
<v Speaker 1>things we don't need to be afraid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we learned were more likely to </v>

876
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:24.794
<v Speaker 1>have horrible judgment than have her </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortex not work very well and </v>

877
00:52:28.101 --> 00:52:30.890
<v Speaker 1>the newest realm of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you're stressed,</v>

878
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:31.783
<v Speaker 1>you're less empathic because it takes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of work to try to view the world </v>

879
00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:38.204
<v Speaker 1>from somebody else's perspective and </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about their worries instead of </v>

880
00:52:40.911 --> 00:52:41.990
<v Speaker 1>your own problems.</v>

881
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.580
<v Speaker 2>And if you're in a defensive or worried </v>
<v Speaker 2>position that you're most likely to lash</v>

882
00:52:46.581 --> 00:52:47.414
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're most likely to protect yourself </v>

883
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:49.480
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

884
00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:50.383
<v Speaker 2>And quite literally a part of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's involved in empathy doesn't work </v>

885
00:52:54.081 --> 00:52:56.390
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When stress hormone levels are elevated.</v>

886
00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:57.643
<v Speaker 2>Now what about the frontal cortex and an</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual damage like damaged from car </v>

887
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 2>accidents or head trauma?</v>

888
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:10.980
<v Speaker 1>One incredibly interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contentious area.</v>

889
00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:16.220
<v Speaker 1>You massively damaged somebody's frontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex and they will know the difference</v>

890
00:53:17.701 --> 00:53:19.530
<v Speaker 1>between right and wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

891
00:53:19.531 --> 00:53:20.364
<v Speaker 1>they still cannot regulate their </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior on the most fundamental level </v>

892
00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:29.490
<v Speaker 1>famous neurological patients in the 1840</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] phineas gage,</v>

893
00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.553
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had part of his frontal cortex </v>

894
00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:32.484
<v Speaker 1>destroyed in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a foreman of a railroad </v>

895
00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:37.350
<v Speaker 1>construction line who have problems with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some dynamite.</v>

896
00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 13 foot metal raw shot of one of his</v>

897
00:53:41.281 --> 00:53:45.630
<v Speaker 1>eyes and at the top of his head and took</v>
<v Speaker 1>his frontal cortex with landing about 50</v>

898
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:50.631
<v Speaker 1>feet away and gage who was the sobriety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This devout reliable,</v>

899
00:53:51.211 --> 00:53:52.044
<v Speaker 1>he was the foreman there turns into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>dis-inhibited crass sexually abusive </v>

900
00:53:57.661 --> 00:53:58.494
<v Speaker 1>bully afterward who never was able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold a job again for years afterward </v>

901
00:54:02.071 --> 00:54:02.904
<v Speaker 1>because you would take an outage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortex and you damage the </v>

902
00:54:06.511 --> 00:54:11.511
<v Speaker 1>frontal cortex and you get dysregulation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of volitional behavior,</v>

903
00:54:11.851 --> 00:54:12.684
<v Speaker 1>which is once again we have saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>people know what the optimal behavior </v>

904
00:54:16.291 --> 00:54:18.240
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between right and wrong,</v>

905
00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:20.760
<v Speaker 1>and yet they can't regulate their </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

906
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on which study you look at,</v>

907
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.073
<v Speaker 1>something like 25 to 50 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>men on death row in this country have a </v>

908
00:54:29.491 --> 00:54:33.300
<v Speaker 1>history of concussion head trauma to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of their heads,</v>

909
00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.173
<v Speaker 1>and that's a world of like volitional </v>
<v Speaker 1>control is not that volitional because </v>

910
00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.100
<v Speaker 1>that seems to go contrary to the idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lobotomy then.</v>

911
00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luvata bottomy was just.</v>

912
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.033
<v Speaker 1>That's great that the law bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was just like savaging about the </v>

913
00:54:53.041 --> 00:54:53.874
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third of the brain is giving you the </v>

914
00:54:55.171 --> 00:54:57.720
<v Speaker 1>front photo is also getting limbic </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional.</v>

915
00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.620
<v Speaker 1>What did they do when they did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potteries?</v>

916
00:54:59.850 --> 00:55:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time it really got developed,</v>

917
00:55:02.311 --> 00:55:05.670
<v Speaker 1>the guy like one of science's amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>irony is that guy,</v>

918
00:55:05.671 --> 00:55:10.600
<v Speaker 1>a Portuguese neurologist named a cosmo </v>
<v Speaker 1>knees who developed Lucado.</v>

919
00:55:10.601 --> 00:55:11.434
<v Speaker 1>Amy's is what they were originally </v>
<v Speaker 1>called about the Nobel prize in </v>

920
00:55:13.591 --> 00:55:16.080
<v Speaker 1>physiology and medicine for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful technique,</v>

921
00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:21.390
<v Speaker 1>and then when it hit America as a sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of psychiatric intervention,</v>

922
00:55:21.391 --> 00:55:22.224
<v Speaker 1>good American knowhow and can do spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to get a sort of assembly line </v>

923
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:27.264
<v Speaker 1>approach to it.</v>

924
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Finding Walter Freeman pioneered sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapid,</v>

925
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.193
<v Speaker 1>like wham Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontal lobotomies where you would </v>

926
00:55:35.551 --> 00:55:36.384
<v Speaker 1>insert in the high pick through some an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice pick rather behind somebody's </v>

927
00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:41.483
<v Speaker 1>eyeball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up through the optical cavity there </v>

928
00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.860
<v Speaker 1>and go in there and just screw around </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there,</v>

929
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:47.694
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had like instructional films </v>

930
00:55:49.861 --> 00:55:53.220
<v Speaker 1>in the fifties for having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do a frontal lobotomy and like</v>

931
00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:54.173
<v Speaker 1>one person every 10 minutes and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like go through an entire hospitals </v>

932
00:55:57.511 --> 00:55:58.344
<v Speaker 1>where the psychiatric patients in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>like devoted afternoon of calvinist </v>

933
00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:03.930
<v Speaker 1>ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard work.</v>

934
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 1>So they were just scrambling it and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were scrambling.</v>

935
00:56:06.631 --> 00:56:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So the neurobiology of like what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were disconnecting there was,</v>

936
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:15.780
<v Speaker 1>it was like virtually random other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were just making a mess in the front</v>

937
00:56:15.781 --> 00:56:19.620
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So frontal damage instead is a much more</v>

938
00:56:19.621 --> 00:56:20.454
<v Speaker 1>selective issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you shutter when you think about the </v>

939
00:56:21.931 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 1>fact that that was just not even 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago?</v>

940
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

941
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:31.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Code Code Code on medical school library</v>

942
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:31.894
<v Speaker 1>and go keep floors down to the sub sub </v>
<v Speaker 1>basement and like go read some of these </v>

943
00:56:36.251 --> 00:56:40.830
<v Speaker 1>journals from like 19 or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>

944
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shutter her,</v>

945
00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things they didn't know them,</v>

946
00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damage they could have done.</v>

947
00:56:48.341 --> 00:56:51.760
<v Speaker 1>Then the damages to the causes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>

948
00:56:51.761 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 1>the causes of psychiatric disorders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My God,</v>

949
00:56:55.271 --> 00:56:56.104
<v Speaker 1>some of the things they were doing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you've got a shred of capacity </v>

950
00:57:00.221 --> 00:57:03.640
<v Speaker 1>for self reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you then have to sit there and say,</v>

951
00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:04.773
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years from now they're going </v>

952
00:57:05.691 --> 00:57:06.524
<v Speaker 1>to be looking at our level of knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'll be saying the same exact </v>

953
00:57:10.181 --> 00:57:10.810
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

954
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.090
<v Speaker 2>What do you think would be the Big One?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it would be?</v>

955
00:57:13.091 --> 00:57:13.924
<v Speaker 2>Antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it would be painkillers </v>

956
00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:16.533
<v Speaker 2>that they're handing out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think we'd be the big one </v>

957
00:57:17.681 --> 00:57:19.150
<v Speaker 2>that people be freaking out about today?</v>

958
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I think about what we think what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing now.</v>

959
00:57:22.971 --> 00:57:25.980
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's overwhelmingly good at b,</v>

960
00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:28.910
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that quaint,</v>

961
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:29.883
<v Speaker 1>medieval destructive belief they held </v>
<v Speaker 1>onto them about human agency and </v>

962
00:57:35.061 --> 00:57:37.460
<v Speaker 1>freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

963
00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:42.730
<v Speaker 1>They punished people who had brains that</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't regulate their own behavior.</v>

964
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:44.203
<v Speaker 1>They punished people who because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>toxin exposure or stress during </v>

965
00:57:47.751 --> 00:57:48.584
<v Speaker 1>adolescence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wound up with brains that couldn't </v>

966
00:57:50.301 --> 00:57:51.134
<v Speaker 1>control this or that a particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>junctures and they used words like </v>

967
00:57:54.081 --> 00:57:56.360
<v Speaker 1>justice back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

968
00:57:56.361 --> 00:57:57.194
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe the stuff they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was practically like gangs and Gordy </v>

969
00:58:02.091 --> 00:58:02.924
<v Speaker 1>risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peasants getting burning torches and </v>

970
00:58:04.461 --> 00:58:05.294
<v Speaker 1>going and burning down into whatever's </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the medieval castle in terms of </v>

971
00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:09.584
<v Speaker 1>senses of the word justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>applying to what biology has to do with </v>

972
00:58:13.881 --> 00:58:14.714
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

973
00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:17.980
<v Speaker 2>There's so few people that share this </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea that you're having.</v>

974
00:58:17.981 --> 00:58:18.814
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously your sense of it is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more educated than the average </v>

975
00:58:21.521 --> 00:58:22.354
<v Speaker 2>person and you understand all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms behind all of these </v>

976
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:26.163
<v Speaker 2>particular behavioral problems that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people have and all these different </v>

977
00:58:29.471 --> 00:58:31.510
<v Speaker 2>things can affect the way human beings </v>
<v Speaker 2>operate,</v>

978
00:58:31.511 --> 00:58:36.511
<v Speaker 2>but most people are not aware of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally most people like if you</v>

979
00:58:36.551 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 2>had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's.</v>

980
00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.013
<v Speaker 2>It might be in the 90 percent of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't really considered all the </v>

981
00:58:41.501 --> 00:58:42.334
<v Speaker 2>factors that lead to someone having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain that would put them in these </v>

982
00:58:45.941 --> 00:58:50.050
<v Speaker 2>impulsive decision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible decision making situations.</v>

983
00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:56.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what gives me a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of optimism is most people though,</v>

984
00:58:56.371 --> 00:58:57.204
<v Speaker 1>at least in the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done that in a couple of realms </v>

985
00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:01.853
<v Speaker 1>like 500 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had an epileptic seizure for </v>

986
00:59:05.701 --> 00:59:07.830
<v Speaker 1>smartest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most reflective,</v>

987
00:59:07.831 --> 00:59:11.230
<v Speaker 1>most compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like middle ages,</v>

988
00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:12.533
<v Speaker 1>bleeding heart liberals even would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>had an explanation for what caused an </v>

989
00:59:15.721 --> 00:59:16.554
<v Speaker 1>epileptic seizure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is you were demonically possessed </v>

990
00:59:18.390 --> 00:59:19.223
<v Speaker 1>and the therapeutic intervention done </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie with the and now instead we're </v>

991
00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.593
<v Speaker 1>know a century or two into having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset where instead we make a </v>

992
00:59:28.671 --> 00:59:30.710
<v Speaker 1>biological statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

993
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his disease.</v>

994
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.123
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not demonically possessed these </v>

995
00:59:35.271 --> 00:59:36.104
<v Speaker 1>cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something screwy with this potassium </v>

996
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:38.054
<v Speaker 1>channels in the brain unless he gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>synchronized outburst and every now and </v>

997
00:59:40.851 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 1>then he has a seizure disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's taken us about 500 years to do</v>

998
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:48.550
<v Speaker 1>that one to go from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

999
00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.660
<v Speaker 1>a blast room.</v>

1000
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 1>This behavior where we know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention,</v>

1001
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:54.590
<v Speaker 1>which is to burn somebody at the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>

1002
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.600
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a biological problem.</v>

1003
00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.360
<v Speaker 1>And we even recognize constraints with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1004
00:59:59.361 --> 01:00:02.570
<v Speaker 1>If somebody has uncontrolled epilepsy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's treatment resistant,</v>

1005
01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may not be able to get a driver's </v>

1006
01:00:06.141 --> 01:00:08.450
<v Speaker 1>license,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't sit there and say,</v>

1007
01:00:08.451 --> 01:00:09.284
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a burning of the driver's </v>

1008
01:00:10.971 --> 01:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>licenses and the epileptics it's about </v>
<v Speaker 1>damn time they got.</v>

1009
01:00:13.971 --> 01:00:15.500
<v Speaker 1>But they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1010
01:00:15.501 --> 01:00:20.501
<v Speaker 1>it's a realm where words like evil or </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul or punishment or justice,</v>

1011
01:00:20.721 --> 01:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>it's totally irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1012
01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:26.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a neurological disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's only taken us about 500 years to</v>

1013
01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>get to that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you know,</v>

1014
01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:32.420
<v Speaker 1>we've done that cognitive leap at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>

1015
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>There's no victims there though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no yet.</v>

1016
01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:37.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1017
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.400
<v Speaker 2>but most of the time obviously if </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone's behind the wheel and they have</v>

1018
01:00:40.401 --> 01:00:42.050
<v Speaker 2>a seizure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then someone dies.</v>

1019
01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:42.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't think of it as someone </v>

1020
01:00:43.881 --> 01:00:45.320
<v Speaker 2>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think of it there,</v>

1021
01:00:45.321 --> 01:00:47.240
<v Speaker 2>they lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lost control of their body,</v>

1022
01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 2>like literally piloting a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

1023
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:53.120
<v Speaker 2>And that's what happens if I ever versus</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone committing a crime</v>

1024
01:00:53.220 --> 01:00:54.053
<v Speaker 1>500 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an epileptic during a seizure where </v>

1025
01:00:56.821 --> 01:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>their linens flailing struck someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been assault and battery</v>

1026
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:05.470
<v Speaker 1>because told them to go like sleep with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan,</v>

1027
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>that's damn fault and it's like it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous mindset.</v>

1028
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:10.673
<v Speaker 1>Now there's large parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing world that still has exactly </v>

1029
01:01:12.931 --> 01:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>that view of epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least in the west,</v>

1030
01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>like that's an unrecognizably different </v>
<v Speaker 1>mindset.</v>

1031
01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1032
01:01:20.221 --> 01:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>that was not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't choose to do that.</v>

1033
01:01:22.621 --> 01:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>That was something screwy with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology.</v>

1034
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Like we've gotten to that so I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1035
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.273
<v Speaker 1>maybe another 500 years and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to do that with maybe half </v>

1036
01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:34.644
<v Speaker 1>the jury's in this country are capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing the same thing of saying it's </v>

1037
01:01:38.131 --> 01:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>not him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his disease.</v>

1038
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.853
<v Speaker 1>When you have somebody with paranoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia who in a delusional state </v>

1039
01:01:43.551 --> 01:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>that something violent maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1040
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>half of teachers in the country are able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to incorporate.</v>

1041
01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kid isn't lazy.</v>

1042
01:01:51.661 --> 01:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>That's not why they're not learning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>read.</v>

1043
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:54.773
<v Speaker 1>They have this thing called dyslexia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning there's abnormalities micro or </v>

1044
01:01:58.050 --> 01:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>macro maladies in their cortex and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>part having to do.</v>

1045
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:03.220
<v Speaker 1>It's not them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1046
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:06.150
<v Speaker 1>so we're making a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

1047
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:07.950
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you seem optimistic,</v>

1048
01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:11.920
<v Speaker 2>optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 500 year time span.</v>

1049
01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:15.480
<v Speaker 2>We think it's kind of playing out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right direction.</v>

1050
01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:16.373
<v Speaker 2>Just very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you see these like political </v>

1051
01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:21.750
<v Speaker 2>debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people on television talking about crime</v>

1052
01:02:21.751 --> 01:02:22.584
<v Speaker 2>and punishment and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and none of these factors being </v>

1053
01:02:24.781 --> 01:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>discussed is incredibly frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible,</v>

1054
01:02:27.590 --> 01:02:32.590
<v Speaker 1>really frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they will look back at us and say,</v>

1055
01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.213
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things they thought then the damage </v>

1056
01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>they did then and all we can do at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>

1057
01:02:41.111 --> 01:02:41.944
<v Speaker 1>given that we'll know a whole lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biology and look at most of this stuff </v>

1058
01:02:47.051 --> 01:02:51.610
<v Speaker 1>that we've learned about the frontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex or oxytocin or jeans.</v>

1059
01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And we've learned all of that in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 50 years,</v>

1060
01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:57.250
<v Speaker 1>in the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last five years.</v>

1061
01:02:57.550 --> 01:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Like you look at the distribution when </v>
<v Speaker 1>these papers were published,</v>

1062
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1063
01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:04.143
<v Speaker 1>all we could do in the meantime is have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hell of a lot of humility before we </v>

1064
01:03:09.881 --> 01:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>think we understand what the causes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the behavior,</v>

1065
01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.653
<v Speaker 1>especially behavior that we judge </v>
<v Speaker 1>harshly because the odds are we haven't </v>

1066
01:03:16.991 --> 01:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>a clue what the actual biology is at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there.</v>

1067
01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:25.560
<v Speaker 1>And we fill in those attributional </v>
<v Speaker 1>yawning vacuums with this invention that</v>

1068
01:03:27.131 --> 01:03:30.140
<v Speaker 1>we call volition and free will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has anything</v>

1069
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:35.180
<v Speaker 2>on every use toxo for an excuse or for </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense,</v>

1070
01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.144
<v Speaker 2>for crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't because there was that in case </v>

1071
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:42.840
<v Speaker 2>you remember twinkie case Dan white </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood sugar level,</v>

1072
01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:43.683
<v Speaker 1>both that's been used of severe Perry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Menstrual Syndrome has been used </v>

1073
01:03:49.481 --> 01:03:50.314
<v Speaker 1>successfully in courts of law to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigate sentencing of women who </v>

1074
01:03:52.811 --> 01:03:54.770
<v Speaker 1>committed violent crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1075
01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>around the time of their period having </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain variants on jeans.</v>

1076
01:03:58.751 --> 01:03:59.584
<v Speaker 1>This one gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which unfortunately this variant is </v>

1077
01:04:01.301 --> 01:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the horrible term.</v>

1078
01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:03.603
<v Speaker 1>The warrior gene has been used </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful in a couple of courts of law </v>

1079
01:04:06.611 --> 01:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>to mitigate sentence saying what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are they?</v>

1080
01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Have they used that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this,</v>

1081
01:04:11.350 --> 01:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gene called Mao.</v>

1082
01:04:14.231 --> 01:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Alpha model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amine oxidase Alpha,</v>

1083
01:04:17.390 --> 01:04:18.223
<v Speaker 1>it's got something to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurochemistry and something to do with </v>

1084
01:04:20.681 --> 01:04:21.514
<v Speaker 1>the neurochemistry of aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gene comes in a couple of different </v>

1085
01:04:25.871 --> 01:04:30.871
<v Speaker 1>versions and one particular variant is </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with high rates of antisocial</v>

1086
01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:32.884
<v Speaker 1>aggression in humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If and only if the human was abused </v>

1087
01:04:37.391 --> 01:04:40.000
<v Speaker 1>during childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

1088
01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>that gene is determining absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

1089
01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>You're getting a gene environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>

1090
01:04:45.251 --> 01:04:49.360
<v Speaker 1>The absence of an abusive childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having this gene variant has zero impact</v>

1091
01:04:49.361 --> 01:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>on this behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like ridiculous.</v>

1092
01:04:52.661 --> 01:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Lee Simplified pseudoscientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations.</v>

1093
01:04:56.891 --> 01:05:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Findings like these have sort of led you</v>
<v Speaker 1>into courts of law saying,</v>

1094
01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:01.413
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has that genetic variant that's </v>

1095
01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>

1096
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:06.370
<v Speaker 2>So is this similar in a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1097
01:05:06.371 --> 01:05:07.204
<v Speaker 2>I believe it was India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used Mri to determine someone's </v>

1098
01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:13.150
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of a murder and they convicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woman that made her guilty of it.</v>

1099
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:14.180
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1100
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:15.263
<v Speaker 1>No lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mri is the name of the company in the </v>

1101
01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:18.993
<v Speaker 1>United States that purports to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology well enough that they can </v>

1102
01:05:20.711 --> 01:05:21.840
<v Speaker 1>tell if you're lying or not,</v>

1103
01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from what I understand,</v>

1104
01:05:23.991 --> 01:05:26.750
<v Speaker 2>it was just functional knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crime yet,</v>

1105
01:05:26.751 --> 01:05:31.510
<v Speaker 2>which could have been imparted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>defending or trying to put together,</v>

1106
01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.480
<v Speaker 2>just because you're obviously have a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>invested in this crime because you might</v>

1107
01:05:35.481 --> 01:05:37.100
<v Speaker 2>go to jail for the rest of your life for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1108
01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:41.160
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically there's no science for that.</v>

1109
01:05:41.161 --> 01:05:42.630
<v Speaker 1>The science is not there yet.</v>

1110
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.670
<v Speaker 2>So it would never work in America that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that case or should not,</v>

1111
01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.530
<v Speaker 2>I should say ship not and should not </v>
<v Speaker 2>work in India.</v>

1112
01:05:49.531 --> 01:05:50.570
<v Speaker 2>India was going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1113
01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1114
01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:54.150
<v Speaker 2>that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what have they done with this warrior</v>

1115
01:05:54.151 --> 01:05:55.700
<v Speaker 2>gene?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How has someone been exonerated?</v>

1116
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where was it?</v>

1117
01:05:57.590 --> 01:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it wasn't a court in Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1118
01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:01.653
<v Speaker 1>we're just sentencing was decreased </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the defense made an argument </v>

1119
01:06:04.401 --> 01:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>afterwards saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well genetically predisposed.</v>

1120
01:06:07.851 --> 01:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>So like that's</v>

1121
01:06:11.890 --> 01:06:12.723
<v Speaker 2>isn't Italy the place where they charged</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists with not being able to </v>

1122
01:06:17.861 --> 01:06:18.694
<v Speaker 2>register when an earthquake earthquake </v>
<v Speaker 2>by assuring the public there wasn't an </v>

1123
01:06:21.911 --> 01:06:23.880
<v Speaker 2>earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Literally tried them for that.</v>

1124
01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:24.883
<v Speaker 2>I think that's my people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the dust is still settling from </v>

1125
01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:33.514
<v Speaker 2>that one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of those convictions have </v>

1126
01:06:35.201 --> 01:06:37.570
<v Speaker 2>been overturned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But but terrifying that those people had</v>

1127
01:06:37.571 --> 01:06:40.240
<v Speaker 2>to go to court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You imagine if you're a seismologist and</v>

1128
01:06:40.241 --> 01:06:41.110
<v Speaker 2>you have to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1129
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:44.380
<v Speaker 2>this is not how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You asked Jesus Christ,</v>

1130
01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:45.214
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell you when it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think I would be out of the </v>

1131
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:49.690
<v Speaker 2>country also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fuck is wrong with you.</v>

1132
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My son,</v>

1133
01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:54.730
<v Speaker 2>the scientist is like being convicted of</v>
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>

1134
01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.713
<v Speaker 2>So it's essentially in these less </v>
<v Speaker 2>informed areas where these things have </v>

1135
01:06:59.051 --> 01:07:00.280
<v Speaker 2>passed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the Fmr,</v>

1136
01:07:00.281 --> 01:07:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I think in India and this in Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the warrior gene thing.</v>

1137
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Well what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's dangerous,</v>

1138
01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:05.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1139
01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean you see like be careful what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wish for in terms of creative people.</v>

1140
01:07:10.781 --> 01:07:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Learn more about science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more to sign.</v>

1141
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
