1
00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five,</v>

2
00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:03.270
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.950
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>Larry Sharp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are you sir?</v>

5
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>I am doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for having me.</v>

6
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get started,</v>

7
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

8
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like you a lot.</v>

9
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I like winning Ryan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

10
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.373
<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you right now upfront,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been listening to a lot of </v>

11
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a lot of your interviews.</v>

12
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>You make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like,</v>

13
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't win,</v>

14
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>so you talking so logically you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>win the,</v>

15
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hope is that the people who actually</v>

16
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>have given up who think it's so stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't bother voting.</v>

17
00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:36.474
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the hope is I say something that </v>

18
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>makes sense and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

19
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

20
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If those people vote,</v>

21
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>you win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I win.</v>

22
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an untapped resource of </v>

23
00:00:47.251 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>unmotivated people who are too fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how do we fix that?</v>

24
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a matter of getting people,</v>

25
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:57.291
<v Speaker 1>I believe firmly that if we could get </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to register and vote online,</v>

26
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>especially with their phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes the world.</v>

27
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are Really,</v>

28
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe that.</v>

29
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think that this is also a concern </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people that are in the Democratic</v>

30
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Party and the Republican Party and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think they want that 100% look.</v>

31
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.990
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're relying on voter apathy.</v>

32
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.043
<v Speaker 1>There were also relying on people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are committed to their parties and who </v>

33
00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>are politically active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not the majority of the people.</v>

34
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>It's the establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

35
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked how we fixed this.</v>

36
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Bernie and trump actually told us this </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 they told us two things.</v>

37
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can get people to an event,</v>

38
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you can get them to the polling station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

39
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>that's what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of events.</v>

40
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I do over 30 events every month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always doing events,</v>

41
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>getting people to show up because if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get him to show up to my event,</v>

42
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>I can get them to a polling booth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Cause to come to s to hear me speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a lot of choices out there.</v>

44
00:01:42.901 --> 00:01:43.734
<v Speaker 1>You can be on Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have with your family and </v>

45
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be playing a video game.</v>

46
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>You choose to come hear me speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll come to the polling station.</v>

47
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:51.144
<v Speaker 1>That's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how do I get into care in the first </v>

48
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hope.</v>

49
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>The average person who votes often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>If you vote often you use the vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of fear.</v>

51
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>The two party system installs fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care about my guy or Gal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm so afraid of the other guy.</v>

53
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll go out and support my guy or gal </v>
<v Speaker 1>even don't even know his name.</v>

54
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I just know I don't like the red team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by blue,</v>

55
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the blue team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I vote red.</v>

56
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>But to get someone who doesn't vote and </v>
<v Speaker 1>He York states really bad.</v>

57
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 70% of New Yorkers don't vote.</v>

58
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge chunk over 7 million New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yorkers.</v>

59
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 1>70% yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70% yeah.</v>

60
00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:21.034
<v Speaker 1>Last likes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 67% so it helped us </v>

61
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>around 70 to get those people out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to give them hope.</v>

62
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Bernie gave the left hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump gave the right hope.</v>

63
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>If the Democratic Party wasn't so broken</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a party,</v>

64
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Bernie would have been their nominee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been hope against hope.</v>

65
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>It was hope against establishment hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

66
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.443
<v Speaker 1>That's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hope the other two guys who are </v>

67
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>running in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>

68
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

69
00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>that totally establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you say some really logical things.</v>

70
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.090
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that you've said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobody wants to touch you,</v>

71
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:50.924
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about gun violence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about these mass </v>

72
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>shootings.</v>

73
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.793
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you said there's two things that </v>

74
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>they have in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them,</v>

75
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't have relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

76
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>they don't have girlfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boyfriends,</v>

77
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost always girl,</v>

78
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>a guy that does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually it don't.</v>

79
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And boys tend to be more violent in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tent.</v>

80
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Males tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get mad at me being sexist,</v>

81
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.574
<v Speaker 1>but I'm guessing are in stats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just statistically males tend to </v>

82
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>outwardly strike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women tend to him when the strikers,</v>

83
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>the general statistically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's exceptions,</v>

84
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only other,</v>

85
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>the other factor is psychotropic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

86
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And these are two things that no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to talk about.</v>

87
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:26.704
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're both real and they're both </v>

88
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.194
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is it that you think that these </v>

89
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.873
<v Speaker 1>are there obvious facts that people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ignore because they don't actually </v>

90
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>want to fix the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

91
00:03:38.231 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>If you fix the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have controversy.</v>

92
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.403
<v Speaker 1>If you know of controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a left versus right </v>

93
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.160
<v Speaker 1>paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you realize that that's what it is?</v>

94
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First off,</v>

95
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to touch the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to fix the problem.</v>

96
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>If you want to fix the problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>school shootings,</v>

97
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two things.</v>

98
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Remember as I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you've heard me say before,</v>

99
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>the school shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it is a murder at its core,</v>

100
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.823
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a public suicide and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand that at its </v>

101
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>core,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most mass shootings are public suicides.</v>

102
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>They would understand that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like death by cop,</v>

103
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's public suicide,</v>

104
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>so you have to make sure you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>happier people,</v>

105
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then why did they school?</v>

106
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Why did they choose schools?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Several reasons.</v>

107
00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's where they're,</v>

108
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>they're assumed enemies are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The insoles think that the guys,</v>

109
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>the bad guys and the bad girls were </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

110
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>But something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soft targets.</v>

111
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>The other thing you remember from all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these school shootings is there planned,</v>

112
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.983
<v Speaker 1>and that's a critical aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to stop school shooting in New </v>

113
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.013
<v Speaker 1>York state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to pass one extra law at </v>

114
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:30.724
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have do one minor thing and one thing </v>

115
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is say if you are a licensed,</v>

116
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your license and you have a permit to</v>

117
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>carry a firearm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to in school,</v>

118
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>you may,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you a teacher or administrator,</v>

119
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>if you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may.</v>

120
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.423
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to force a teacher to </v>

121
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>carry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need a resource officer.</v>

122
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you have a resource officer,</v>

123
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>which is what most Republicans will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put an officer there,</v>

124
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>they'll just shoot him first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you all democrats,</v>

125
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>no guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll shoot everybody.</v>

126
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>So if you instead say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's armed.</v>

128
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Is it an administrator as a teacher?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is everybody isn't nobody.</v>

129
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>The planning goes away once there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>planning available.</v>

130
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>The school was no longer a soft target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stop choosing the school.</v>

131
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.083
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linda,</v>

132
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.463
<v Speaker 1>what's on practice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that if you have an </v>

133
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>officer on the school that carries a gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this person knows that officer has a</v>

134
00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.530
<v Speaker 1>gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will shoot him first?</v>

135
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:21.364
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that if just teachers are carrying </v>

136
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:24.034
<v Speaker 1>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way this person knows and so </v>

137
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>they're less likely to shoot people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're are less.</v>

138
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>There's two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

139
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.380
<v Speaker 1>here's the core of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's killing our children?</v>

140
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>It's not firearms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The the one of the,</v>

141
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the Texas shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was before he stole the guns.</v>

142
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:39.304
<v Speaker 1>He had put together and set up pipe </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs and pressure cooker bombs in case </v>

143
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't steal the guns.</v>

144
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>So if he couldn't get guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to kill people.</v>

145
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:46.774
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key thing here is what's killing </v>

146
00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.950
<v Speaker 1>these kids?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lack of community,</v>

147
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 1>lack of purpose and loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's killing our kids.</v>

148
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>Those three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take those three things away.</v>

149
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>Kids don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You give a kid who's 16 1718 purpose,</v>

150
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>he can't go off and kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something to do.</v>

151
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Here's a reason to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

152
00:06:06.381 --> 00:06:07.214
<v Speaker 1>this is a public suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a reason to live and you </v>

153
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>think the right answer is to go do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

154
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't kill yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't kill yourself,</v>

155
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>there's no public suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass shootings all of a sudden,</v>

156
00:06:16.611 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>a tremendously reduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just how it works.</v>

157
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>It's human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that,</v>

158
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>but if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's no extra law.</v>

159
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Then there's no one to point a finger </v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

160
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.300
<v Speaker 1>You can't restrict guns.</v>

161
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.463
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying just makes actual sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where you and I brick company </v>

162
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:31.004
<v Speaker 1>because I don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that anyone is trying to </v>

163
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>keep the school shootings in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

164
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:39.260
<v Speaker 1>There are now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's two things.</v>

165
00:06:39.261 --> 00:06:40.094
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to demonize psychotropic </v>

166
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:43.244
<v Speaker 1>drugs and especially politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a really hard time with that </v>

167
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.333
<v Speaker 1>because they don't want to tell people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are on psychotropic drugs that </v>

168
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>they're either suspects or suspicious or</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential mass shooters.</v>

169
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.633
<v Speaker 1>It's incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We made the safe act and the safe act </v>

170
00:06:57.951 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 1>literally says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go on these drugs,</v>

171
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:00.134
<v Speaker 1>you lose your firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's absolutely not true in New </v>

172
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.410
<v Speaker 1>York state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be true in California,</v>

173
00:07:03.411 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know your laws here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in New York state,</v>

174
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>the opposite is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

175
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.333
<v Speaker 1>we've already done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have made our medical personnel part </v>

176
00:07:10.161 --> 00:07:13.520
<v Speaker 1>of our secret state police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means if you go in and say,</v>

177
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need some drugs,</v>

179
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about suicide.</v>

180
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.423
<v Speaker 1>The state police might combine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take your firearms that's already </v>

181
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>happening in New York state and they now</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to create red flag laws,</v>

182
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:27.260
<v Speaker 1>which means a teacher can now do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now a teacher says,</v>

183
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.123
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a student who I see drew a </v>

184
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>firearm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He a gun cops and robbers,</v>

185
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.013
<v Speaker 1>maybe a red flag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me go to a judge and see if I can </v>

186
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:37.310
<v Speaker 1>have the cops go and take his father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>firearm.</v>

187
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.153
<v Speaker 1>I'd definitely want to talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to bring it back to what you </v>

188
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:40.574
<v Speaker 1>said earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't think they want to fix the </v>

189
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.520
<v Speaker 1>problem yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

190
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:44.583
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think they have a viable </v>

191
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>solution that they think is politically </v>
<v Speaker 1>viable perhaps.</v>

192
00:07:51.081 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>But I think my solution seems bloke </v>
<v Speaker 1>avaiable people,</v>

193
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say everyone I say this too,</v>

194
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:56.960
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>

195
00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.823
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

196
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are definitely right that they're </v>

197
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.180
<v Speaker 1>lonely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad people that are lashing out.</v>

198
00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 1>And I think you're definitely right that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many instances it's a public suicide.</v>

199
00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you're definitely right that</v>

200
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of them are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotropic drugs,</v>

201
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.730
<v Speaker 1>which do have a disassociative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

202
00:08:13.731 --> 00:08:14.564
<v Speaker 1>aspect to them where they're not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure they're aware of what they're </v>

203
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

204
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>if you've talked to him on those people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have been on these things,</v>

205
00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.083
<v Speaker 1>things don't mean anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a car accident in front of them </v>

206
00:08:26.031 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have various reactions to various</v>

207
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.333
<v Speaker 1>SSRS and the antidepressants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one thing that happens is you lose </v>

208
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.420
<v Speaker 1>the highs and lows and everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>just flat.</v>

209
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.680
<v Speaker 1>You become numb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

210
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And you become numb to almost anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>good happens.</v>

211
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

212
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.010
<v Speaker 1>it varies depending upon the individual </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's on these things.</v>

213
00:08:46.011 --> 00:08:46.844
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of that would allow someone to do </v>

214
00:08:49.101 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 1>something horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they wouldn't be able to before.</v>

215
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two things to remember here.</v>

216
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

217
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.140
<v Speaker 2>not concerned with being righteous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm concerned with happy New Yorkers and</v>

218
00:08:59.141 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 2>happy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want.</v>

219
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Righteousness is very low on my priority</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

220
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 2>So if that doesn't sound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if what I'm saying sounds bad,</v>

221
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to fix the problem.</v>

222
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>politician,</v>

223
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.370
<v Speaker 2>which means I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a uh,</v>

224
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 2>a career I have to protect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have interests.</v>

225
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 2>I have to serve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The average donor is $75 so I don't have</v>

226
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of people who are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a huge checks,</v>

227
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.513
<v Speaker 2>so don't have that concern either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe in four years I'll be corrupt </v>

228
00:09:25.701 --> 00:09:28.200
<v Speaker 2>and you can beat your corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

229
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] they're corrupt.</v>

230
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure many of them are,</v>

231
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.570
<v Speaker 2>but I think that they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's things they don't feel like they</v>

232
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:38.370
<v Speaker 2>can discuss politically.</v>

233
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.533
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of those things is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any way demonizing people who are on </v>

234
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 2>antidepressants because a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>along the highest percentage of people,</v>

235
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.070
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our opiate crisis is,</v>

236
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.100
<v Speaker 2>is heavily based upon the idea that when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have pain of any type physical,</v>

237
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.573
<v Speaker 2>mental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is not dealing with that </v>

238
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 2>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the answer is a once a day pill,</v>

239
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

240
00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 2>That is the answer for all of our pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because of that,</v>

241
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of people who are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs and you probably got a stat,</v>

242
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 2>about 80% of all the people who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>currently heroin addicts,</v>

243
00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.233
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow started on someone's that even </v>

244
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 2>though it was theirs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but someone's prescription legal,</v>

245
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.903
<v Speaker 2>legal drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was prescribed for the pain </v>

246
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 2>medication or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually pain medication.</v>

247
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.420
<v Speaker 2>But other things too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're totally correct.</v>

248
00:10:24.421 --> 00:10:25.020
<v Speaker 2>This is a problem.</v>

249
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I talk about often people say,</v>

250
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

251
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Speaker 2>why should I vote for you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why should I support you?</v>

252
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 2>Here's the reason why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you believe I can win or not,</v>

253
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.480
<v Speaker 2>it's actually irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you think I could win,</v>

254
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:38.430
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can win and to be forward with you.</v>

255
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.360
<v Speaker 2>If I went in New York as a libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire nation changes overnight.</v>

256
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's not exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The entire nation changes overnight.</v>

257
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.120
<v Speaker 2>This is the most impactful election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hands down the entire nation.</v>

258
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 2>2018.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

259
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.760
<v Speaker 2>Because it's New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

260
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:55.910
<v Speaker 2>New Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mary Johnson won.</v>

261
00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I would,</v>

262
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.480
<v Speaker 2>New York State was ranked 50th by Cato.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

263
00:11:00.481 --> 00:11:01.920
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>

264
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.783
<v Speaker 2>we have the most people leaving over a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred thousand people leaving every </v>

265
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 2>single year more than any other state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also,</v>

266
00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:08.034
<v Speaker 2>on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were ranked the least friendly to </v>

267
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:10.494
<v Speaker 2>retirees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden Larry Sharp libertarian </v>

268
00:11:12.451 --> 00:11:13.284
<v Speaker 2>becomes governor.</v>

269
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's insane.</v>

270
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 2>The advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a five way race in a five way race.</v>

271
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:20.640
<v Speaker 2>30% could win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is actually winnable race.</v>

272
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:21.803
<v Speaker 2>How's it a five way race?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be his majesty who are </v>

273
00:11:23.611 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 2>current king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He will run,</v>

274
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a republican slowmo cuomo.</v>

275
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

276
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.130
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a republic home and His </v>
<v Speaker 2>Majesty,</v>

277
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.570
<v Speaker 2>cause he's thinks he's a king and he is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a king.</v>

278
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason when I'm in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

279
00:11:32.911 --> 00:11:37.911
<v Speaker 2>I'll call him your grace to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met him one time in 2014.</v>

280
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.900
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

281
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes he was.</v>

282
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:41.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

283
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.780
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was very dismissive.</v>

284
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:43.853
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>

285
00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.693
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was actually with the libertarian </v>

286
00:11:46.111 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 2>candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then in 2014 he was dismissive.</v>

287
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.913
<v Speaker 2>So His majesty will run a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a republican sacrificial </v>

288
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 2>lamb placeholder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows.</v>

289
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:54.784
<v Speaker 2>He'll come in second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably third to me because New York </v>

290
00:11:56.061 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 2>has basically always been a left wing </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

291
00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Not always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I,</v>

292
00:12:00.191 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 2>the last 16 years and the last 16 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York state,</v>

293
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:05.020
<v Speaker 2>same thing happens in a state wide </v>
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>

294
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 2>Blue team comes in first red team comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in second.</v>

295
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Nothing changes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing changes.</v>

296
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 2>That's been the last 16 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But prior to that,</v>

297
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Republicans did when it did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it in citizens tubes in,</v>

298
00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.693
<v Speaker 2>what is she running as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she won't be running in about a week or </v>

299
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

300
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.381
<v Speaker 2>She'll be finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

301
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 2>she'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

302
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.350
<v Speaker 2>How do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let,</v>

303
00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:23.184
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me give you the five people that </v>

304
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:24.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll cover her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

305
00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Those two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then Stephanie minor will run.</v>

306
00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:28.211
<v Speaker 2>She's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

307
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:31.640
<v Speaker 2>an independent who runs out of Syracuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be a green party communist.</v>

308
00:12:31.641 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 2>So run how we hawkins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Communists,</v>

309
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.620
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you call communism,</v>

310
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't be unhappy if I called them </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

311
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

312
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

313
00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.630
<v Speaker 2>he would nod his head probably close.</v>

314
00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

315
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 2>He'd be okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

316
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 2>so him and then myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So five people running.</v>

317
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:46.843
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With five people running New York </v>

318
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 2>state's a plurality state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 30% in theory could actually win this</v>

319
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:52.654
<v Speaker 2>thing with people who know who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already pulled it 25% this is about </v>

320
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>the Quinnipiac poll on Gravis marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul both Poles,</v>

321
00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I pulled about 25% of people who know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you will know who I am.</v>

322
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.000
<v Speaker 2>My problem is name recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

323
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 2>If more people get to know who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that number of,</v>

324
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 2>obviously we'll be going higher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much time do we have here?</v>

325
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Two months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the reality.</v>

326
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I get $2 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I win because all in dollars is all text</v>

327
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:18.093
<v Speaker 2>because I just need to get my name out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already have infrastructure already </v>

328
00:13:19.931 --> 00:13:22.000
<v Speaker 2>had the message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I needed to get my name out,</v>

329
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.760
<v Speaker 2>which takes what it takes is </v>
<v Speaker 2>advertisements on local news.</v>

330
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:26.980
<v Speaker 2>News on local stations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get my name out.</v>

331
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:28.690
<v Speaker 2>That happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I win.</v>

332
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 2>That's not an exaggeration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How important are the debates?</v>

333
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Debates are important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I,</v>

334
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:33.664
<v Speaker 2>if I don't get that money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have to intubate so I have to do </v>

335
00:13:35.461 --> 00:13:36.294
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesse Ventura,</v>

336
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:37.210
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just even sure.</v>

337
00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:39.670
<v Speaker 2>In Minnesota when he had the debates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he won.</v>

338
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 2>He handled the one in debates and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really gave him the,</v>

339
00:13:42.701 --> 00:13:43.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gave him the election.</v>

340
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:44.763
<v Speaker 2>That will give me the election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were a big fan of that movie </v>

341
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Predator that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't,</v>

342
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:50.500
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have time to bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

343
00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:51.120
<v Speaker 2>You Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

344
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:51.953
<v Speaker 2>But those are drawn fragments for those </v>
<v Speaker 2>of you old enough to remember that </v>

345
00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

346
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Jessie didn't have time to bleed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yes.</v>

347
00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's,</v>

348
00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.210
<v Speaker 2>that's what I'm saying with that we make</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happen.</v>

349
00:14:01.211 --> 00:14:04.150
<v Speaker 2>We can actually win and change </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything because all I need is my name</v>

350
00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:04.984
<v Speaker 2>to get out.</v>

351
00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 2>But you asked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The next Nixon,</v>

352
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.233
<v Speaker 2>Cynthia Nixon made an error.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cynthia Nixon is not a politician and </v>

353
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:13.690
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know politics and she thought </v>
<v Speaker 2>that her celebrity would get her a pass.</v>

354
00:14:13.691 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 2>The the democratic machine which is run </v>
<v Speaker 2>by by Cuomo in our state,</v>

355
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 2>so she ran a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephanie minor is also a Democrat,</v>

356
00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.870
<v Speaker 2>but she chose not to run as a Democrat </v>
<v Speaker 2>because she knew that if she ran is that</v>

357
00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:26.883
<v Speaker 2>Cuomo crusher as Comos crushing Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How was he crushing Nixon in the </v>

358
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:31.384
<v Speaker 2>Democratic convention?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are able to get 5% of the vote </v>

359
00:14:34.481 --> 00:14:36.280
<v Speaker 2>from delegates and you get to speak on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>

360
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.550
<v Speaker 2>cuomo controlled those delegates with an</v>
<v Speaker 2>iron fist so much.</v>

361
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.413
<v Speaker 2>He made sure Cynthia Nixon did not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>get 5% she couldn't even get on the </v>

362
00:14:44.471 --> 00:14:45.304
<v Speaker 2>stage to speak and when to be clear said</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next one is a popular actor who </v>

363
00:14:48.671 --> 00:14:49.960
<v Speaker 2>lives in New York City.</v>

364
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.700
<v Speaker 2>There is no way they were enough people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who would have,</v>

365
00:14:52.701 --> 00:14:53.534
<v Speaker 2>if they wanted to hear out speak could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have voted 5% of course he made </v>

366
00:14:56.571 --> 00:14:57.404
<v Speaker 2>sure it didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had to submit 65,000 signatures to </v>

367
00:15:00.381 --> 00:15:03.470
<v Speaker 2>get on the actual ballot so she could be</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the primary.</v>

368
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 2>There is no way that he allows her to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When she doesn't win,</v>

369
00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.293
<v Speaker 2>he debated her and because he thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me just show people that that I </v>

370
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:13.430
<v Speaker 2>don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can just dismiss her and that's why he</v>

371
00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:14.264
<v Speaker 2>debated her and he's going to win and </v>
<v Speaker 2>she's going to lose she and once she </v>

372
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:18.320
<v Speaker 2>loses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think she's going to stay in.</v>

373
00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.110
<v Speaker 2>I doubt she will if she does better for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me because in the basics way race,</v>

374
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 2>but I doubt she will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'll probably drop out in some way,</v>

375
00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:23.990
<v Speaker 2>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My odds.</v>

376
00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:25.820
<v Speaker 2>All should run for Congress or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

377
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.833
<v Speaker 2>In the working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the working families party to do </v>

378
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Working Families Party?</v>

379
00:15:30.231 --> 00:15:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's another party.</v>

380
00:15:31.271 --> 00:15:32.031
<v Speaker 2>So the party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York State?</v>

381
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:32.864
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How New York state runs New York states </v>

382
00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:35.150
<v Speaker 2>has a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a fusion state,</v>

383
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:37.910
<v Speaker 2>which means you can run as multiple </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties if you want to.</v>

384
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 2>You can have three or four or five lines</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to.</v>

385
00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.680
<v Speaker 2>So what often happens is the big two </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties,</v>

386
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.100
<v Speaker 2>they use it as a way to have issue based</v>
<v Speaker 2>voters.</v>

387
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:49.760
<v Speaker 2>So they'll literally create parties to </v>
<v Speaker 2>their credit part that says,</v>

388
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm the working families party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people go,</v>

389
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:53.510
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's not a democrat.</v>

390
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm a working family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'll click that and it's the same</v>

391
00:15:56.001 --> 00:15:56.834
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Como be on four or five lines happens </v>

392
00:15:58.311 --> 00:16:01.250
<v Speaker 2>off the Republicans on three lines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democrat.</v>

393
00:16:01.251 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 2>I think we'll be on probably four lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very complicated process.</v>

394
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

395
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.313
<v Speaker 2>Is there any effort made or is there any</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion whatsoever about potentially </v>

396
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:14.600
<v Speaker 2>moving voting to online and is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you would not fail?</v>

397
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:15.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm not in New York state right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

398
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm unsure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unsure of it.</v>

399
00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.510
<v Speaker 2>I love the concept completely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

400
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 2>The only thing I don't know is it don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the technology behind it.</v>

401
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:23.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how safe it is and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know,</v>

402
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:26.480
<v Speaker 2>but what about banking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can bank online,</v>

403
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:27.890
<v Speaker 2>that's where all your money goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

404
00:16:27.891 --> 00:16:28.724
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea I missed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to commit without knowing </v>

405
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:31.430
<v Speaker 2>that the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>

406
00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.150
<v Speaker 2>New York state is a problem because New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York state throws out everything that is</v>

407
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:36.950
<v Speaker 2>new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've thrown up blockchain.</v>

408
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:39.650
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to do any open source.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

409
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.530
<v Speaker 2>we throw out a hemp and marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

410
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.380
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

411
00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 2>we were trying to show the vaping </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

412
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that's new in New York state,</v>

413
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.103
<v Speaker 2>we try to get rid of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we able to stick with beating up uber </v>

414
00:16:49.101 --> 00:16:49.934
<v Speaker 2>now or taxing uber to pay for the MTA </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the corruption by established </v>

415
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:57.080
<v Speaker 2>bodies that are a hundred percent New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York state likes old money.</v>

416
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:00.320
<v Speaker 2>We're really happy with old money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We do not like new money at all.</v>

417
00:17:00.321 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 2>Which is another reason why the youth is</v>
<v Speaker 2>leaving.</v>

418
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.930
<v Speaker 2>We are the hardest time getting the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to New York because of yes,</v>

419
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.003
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to wait until they're one </v>

420
00:17:07.491 --> 00:17:10.220
<v Speaker 2>politician was arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was that one guy that went to jail?</v>

421
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.320
<v Speaker 2>New York state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so many at you.</v>

422
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was,</v>

423
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:14.594
<v Speaker 2>but he was corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of the main reasons that it </v>

424
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.920
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to make an illegal.</v>

425
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

426
00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.160
<v Speaker 2>it's new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means by default,</v>

427
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:22.910
<v Speaker 2>hit it with a stick.</v>

428
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.040
<v Speaker 2>That's how New York thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's new.</v>

429
00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Hit of a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't like it.</v>

430
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:29.660
<v Speaker 2>It's new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want old stuff for a place called New</v>

431
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.350
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

432
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:31.183
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why my slogan is a new New </v>

433
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:34.520
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the reason why.</v>

434
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:38.150
<v Speaker 2>My slogan is that because we are right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now an old New York and it's not helping</v>

435
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:41.480
<v Speaker 2>at all now as part is the Old New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of,</v>

436
00:17:41.481 --> 00:17:43.580
<v Speaker 2>of the people who are older people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>retiring.</v>

437
00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.280
<v Speaker 2>They can't stay in New York state </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's too expensive,</v>

438
00:17:46.281 --> 00:17:47.114
<v Speaker 2>too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they pack up and go to a North </v>

439
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.201
<v Speaker 2>Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Carolina,</v>

440
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.820
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it taxes?</v>

441
00:17:50.821 --> 00:17:53.550
<v Speaker 2>The real estates?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both its taxes and it's an opportunity.</v>

442
00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 2>It's both of those two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

443
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:57.420
<v Speaker 2>so it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they decided to head on down in North</v>

444
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.021
<v Speaker 2>Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Carolina,</v>

445
00:17:58.021 --> 00:17:58.854
<v Speaker 2>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee.</v>

446
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.840
<v Speaker 2>They actually have a name for us in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carolinas.</v>

447
00:18:00.841 --> 00:18:03.510
<v Speaker 2>They call us halfbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went to Florida and halfway back.</v>

448
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.970
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it halfbacks.</v>

449
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.190
<v Speaker 2>That's how many New Yorkers go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was the worst part.</v>

450
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Go to Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>

451
00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.440
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a mistake.</v>

452
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.060
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

453
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:13.403
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sad part here is though Florida </v>

454
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:18.640
<v Speaker 2>actually has more people than we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>and half of our budget and,</v>

455
00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:19.613
<v Speaker 2>and Scott actually the governor Scott </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually thanked Cuomo for sending all </v>

456
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:23.154
<v Speaker 2>the people on that because 15% of New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York state's budget is actually </v>

457
00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:26.604
<v Speaker 2>pensions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so many people who are pensions are </v>

458
00:18:28.921 --> 00:18:30.900
<v Speaker 2>actually leaving New York state and </v>
<v Speaker 2>going someplace else.</v>

459
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.793
<v Speaker 2>So New York state people are paying for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the pensions and then they're being </v>

460
00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.540
<v Speaker 2>spent in other states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible idea.</v>

461
00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.400
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state is broken.</v>

462
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 2>It is so broken and people are talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about if you're Democrat,</v>

463
00:18:42.031 --> 00:18:44.570
<v Speaker 2>you're saying everything's still great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're Republican,</v>

464
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.230
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well tweak this or tweak that.</v>

465
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying rebuild from scratch.</v>

466
00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.163
<v Speaker 2>There are things you have to change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to change the route so you can </v>

467
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.720
<v Speaker 2>make the branches actually die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We keep clipping branches,</v>

468
00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:58.680
<v Speaker 2>the weeds to keep growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we got way off track with this um,</v>

469
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.210
<v Speaker 2>school shooting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I wanted to get back to it because I</v>

470
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:04.890
<v Speaker 2>think it's a very complex issue and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>need is,</v>

471
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the answer would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there is no one in town.</v>

472
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:10.363
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you've found problems and these </v>

473
00:19:12.571 --> 00:19:14.370
<v Speaker 2>problems that you're willing to discuss </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

474
00:19:14.371 --> 00:19:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Very few people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are these people are lonely and sad that</v>

475
00:19:17.521 --> 00:19:20.010
<v Speaker 2>it's a public suicide and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>on psychotropic drugs?</v>

476
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.873
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know why you don't think </v>

477
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:23.364
<v Speaker 2>that other people want to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that they have a </v>

478
00:19:25.231 --> 00:19:26.064
<v Speaker 2>solution that they can discuss that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not so controversial that it overwhelms </v>

479
00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:32.850
<v Speaker 2>the rest of their messages.</v>

480
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.430
<v Speaker 2>What could be done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

481
00:19:35.490 --> 00:19:36.800
<v Speaker 2>I have a couple of answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

482
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.140
<v Speaker 2>The issue is this is an issue that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>been going on literally for decades,</v>

483
00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.950
<v Speaker 2>so there is no do this and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

484
00:19:42.951 --> 00:19:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are several things.</v>

485
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 2>One of them is fixing education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other one is fixing family courts.</v>

486
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Is it two things?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start slow.</v>

487
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:51.570
<v Speaker 2>How do you fix education?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

488
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.433
<v Speaker 2>It is a complete reboot right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing I'm gonna do with </v>

489
00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:55.464
<v Speaker 2>education is you want to make sure there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is no standardized testing until high </v>

490
00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None whatsoever sounded nice.</v>

491
00:20:00.331 --> 00:20:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Testing is bad for several reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

492
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.740
<v Speaker 2>it's an unfair way of grading teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

493
00:20:04.741 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Teachers are now graded by how their </v>
<v Speaker 2>students do on a standardized test,</v>

494
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:09.090
<v Speaker 2>which is silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean you're a good or a bad</v>

495
00:20:09.091 --> 00:20:10.440
<v Speaker 2>teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next,</v>

496
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:11.363
<v Speaker 2>it makes a bunch of kids who are 10 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>1213 years old feel stupid because </v>

497
00:20:14.521 --> 00:20:15.354
<v Speaker 2>they're not good test takers and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>create now a secondary class of student </v>

498
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.553
<v Speaker 2>for absolutely no reason because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next reason is standardized testing is </v>

499
00:20:22.201 --> 00:20:23.370
<v Speaker 2>no indication of success in life.</v>

500
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.180
<v Speaker 2>You could be a great test taker at 12 or</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 or terrible test taker,</v>

501
00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:29.760
<v Speaker 2>and it does not mean you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful or not successful in life.</v>

502
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 2>Last is how New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often we'll decide how to fund schools.</v>

503
00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's a way of funding schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's also unfair.</v>

504
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:36.983
<v Speaker 2>There's no advantage to standardize </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing except it mean it means the </v>

505
00:20:40.411 --> 00:20:42.360
<v Speaker 2>federal government now begins to control</v>
<v Speaker 2>our schools more.</v>

506
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.700
<v Speaker 2>So when you say the standardized testing</v>
<v Speaker 2>has an,</v>

507
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:46.073
<v Speaker 2>there's an effect on funding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that mean that if a school does </v>

508
00:20:48.191 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 2>really well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get more money?</v>

509
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:50.140
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Often.</v>

510
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.973
<v Speaker 2>It's part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very complex algorithm that New York </v>

511
00:20:53.231 --> 00:20:55.420
<v Speaker 2>state has that almost no one can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually find.</v>

512
00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.820
<v Speaker 2>That seems like it should almost be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposite,</v>

513
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.953
<v Speaker 2>that if a school does poorly that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>should put more resources into that </v>

514
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:03.640
<v Speaker 2>school because it's not being effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>in theory.</v>

515
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.380
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's accurate either.</v>

516
00:21:05.381 --> 00:21:06.214
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we throw about $22,000 per student per </v>

517
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 2>year in New York state and we'll even </v>
<v Speaker 2>than California and it doesn't work.</v>

518
00:21:10.931 --> 00:21:13.790
<v Speaker 2>We have mediocre results at best dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't the answers.</v>

519
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:15.370
<v Speaker 2>It's revamping the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

520
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:18.070
<v Speaker 2>Funding is not the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do you revamp the system?</v>

521
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.400
<v Speaker 2>There's more parts than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First one was just covering of that.</v>

522
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:22.263
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is we shouldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>have k through 12 k through 12 was an </v>

523
00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:25.594
<v Speaker 2>anachronism in shouldn't exist because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last two years she be k through 10 </v>

524
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 2>the last two years of high school for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge chunk of people.</v>

525
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>study hall,</v>

526
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Video Games and probably smoking weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just nothing but bad foot.</v>

527
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Too many students just sitting around </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing nothing.</v>

528
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.560
<v Speaker 2>They have no purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no community.</v>

529
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.670
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no,</v>

530
00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:47.770
<v Speaker 2>no reason to do anything.</v>

531
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:48.670
<v Speaker 2>They were unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

532
00:21:48.671 --> 00:21:49.504
<v Speaker 2>Another reason why they're unhappy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a gross generalization that </v>

533
00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.520
<v Speaker 2>they're unhappy and I know thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

534
00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.383
<v Speaker 2>there's probably a lot of kids listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this that are 16 and 17 they're </v>

535
00:21:57.911 --> 00:21:58.744
<v Speaker 2>working their ass off right now and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a section for that future and I </v>

536
00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:02.410
<v Speaker 2>have a solution for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's even better.</v>

537
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I have a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

538
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:05.540
<v Speaker 2>your limits moving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

539
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 2>First thing is how do I know what I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>said is true,</v>

540
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just asked that question.</v>

541
00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:10.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I just said.</v>

542
00:22:10.511 --> 00:22:11.344
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's true because for the vast </v>

543
00:22:12.341 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 2>majority of students going to college </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

544
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.943
<v Speaker 2>the First Year of college is 13th grade </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're not ready for school </v>

545
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:22.030
<v Speaker 2>because the last two years didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare them for college.</v>

546
00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 2>If it did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't require 13th grade,</v>

547
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 13th grade.</v>

548
00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 2>The adverse that now take six years to </v>
<v Speaker 2>graduate college,</v>

549
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.260
<v Speaker 2>so the results show me that I'm correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

550
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.810
<v Speaker 2>The results of what's happening and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the worst part.</v>

551
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:35.823
<v Speaker 2>Now we shift these kids off to college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who many of them don't even want to go </v>

552
00:22:37.361 --> 00:22:39.040
<v Speaker 2>to college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we sent him anyway.</v>

553
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.053
<v Speaker 2>It takes them six years to graduate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 24 years old with at least 50 k in </v>

554
00:22:43.481 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 2>debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not more,</v>

555
00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.570
<v Speaker 2>minimum decay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some a hundred k something,</v>

556
00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:47.404
<v Speaker 2>200 k depending what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now there's no job for what they </v>

557
00:22:49.841 --> 00:22:51.910
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now they're working at starbucks.</v>

558
00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a disaster that is.</v>

559
00:22:54.251 --> 00:22:56.570
<v Speaker 2>We wonder why our kids coming back home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how about this,</v>

560
00:22:56.571 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 2>since that at 10th grade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a test.</v>

561
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.080
<v Speaker 2>You pass the test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get diploma with you,</v>

562
00:23:02.081 --> 00:23:03.400
<v Speaker 2>a home school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>private school,</v>

563
00:23:03.401 --> 00:23:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Public School,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diplomas,</v>

564
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:05.283
<v Speaker 2>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

565
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Now you have five choices and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly to your point.</v>

566
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.940
<v Speaker 2>You have five choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choice number one,</v>

567
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.760
<v Speaker 2>you're a kid who's hardcore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that college is your answer?</v>

568
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to to get prep school.</v>

569
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that kid who right now you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>had is busting his ass.</v>

570
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.670
<v Speaker 2>He could be in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a prep school of his choice and,</v>

571
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:20.563
<v Speaker 2>and the people in that prep school are </v>
<v Speaker 2>all kids who want to be in that prep </v>

572
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:26.260
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would change his entire situation.</v>

573
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 2>No more knucklehead who don't want to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

574
00:23:28.211 --> 00:23:30.400
<v Speaker 2>who are forced to be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who will cut in class.</v>

575

<v Speaker 2>Could Trade School,</v>

594
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:14.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>become a plumber or a carpenter,</v>

595
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:15.440
<v Speaker 2>Mason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the case.</v>

596
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:16.274
<v Speaker 2>Let me go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York state desperately needs </v>

597
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:18.674
<v Speaker 2>tradesmen desperately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The average trade's person in New York </v>

598
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:21.524
<v Speaker 2>states about 50 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Too old for an average should be 30 </v>

599
00:24:23.841 --> 00:24:26.990
<v Speaker 2>something for an average 35 and before </v>
<v Speaker 2>an average it's too high,</v>

600
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.973
<v Speaker 2>which means we have a lot of trades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs that are not filled and a lot of </v>

601
00:24:30.261 --> 00:24:31.580
<v Speaker 2>foreign labor that has to come to New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York state,</v>

602
00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.530
<v Speaker 2>right in New York or kids aren't doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

603
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Why we've been told a lie and that lie </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the only way to success.</v>

604
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:40.370
<v Speaker 2>The only way is to do well in high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

605
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Get a great for you degree and go get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>job and sit behind a computer all day.</v>

606
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.550
<v Speaker 2>That's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a way to success.</v>

607
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:49.640
<v Speaker 2>It is not the only way to success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of kids now,</v>

608
00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you know people like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>who they spent the first five,</v>

609
00:24:52.521 --> 00:24:55.280
<v Speaker 2>10 years of her life trying to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way,</v>

610
00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Speaker 2>struggling through school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then at 28 years old they go,</v>

611
00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.690
<v Speaker 2>it's going to build houses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

612
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.110
<v Speaker 2>The nigga build the house or that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make.</v>

613
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.340
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be a computer guy and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>just make apps.</v>

614
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:05.420
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Want to do.</v>

615
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:08.390
<v Speaker 2>They should have been doing that at 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still not done.</v>

616
00:25:08.391 --> 00:25:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Most people though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what they want to do.</v>

617
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.270
<v Speaker 2>This is a part and I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The time don't have a passion.</v>

618
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:16.940
<v Speaker 2>They don't have a direction and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>confused.</v>

619
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:17.803
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

620
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 2>this is one of my biggest complaints I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got about this plan.</v>

621
00:25:19.761 --> 00:25:21.470
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of the two ideas are cause he'll</v>

622
00:25:21.471 --> 00:25:22.310
<v Speaker 2>get a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

623
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Just go work or start a business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what you just said is what I get all</v>

624
00:25:25.851 --> 00:25:26.550
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Larry,</v>

625
00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:28.820
<v Speaker 2>they're 16 they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing good.</v>

626
00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:33.910
<v Speaker 2>Make Your mistake at 16 not 26 we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>making mistakes at 26 we have people who</v>

627
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:35.624
<v Speaker 2>are lost at 26 we have a generation now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you ask the people in their twenties </v>

628
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:40.080
<v Speaker 2>right now across this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across this nation,</v>

629
00:25:40.081 --> 00:25:42.710
<v Speaker 2>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you feel like an adult over half will</v>

630
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:43.544
<v Speaker 2>say no over half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say no 40 year olds also the not as </v>

631
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:48.380
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yes.</v>

632
00:25:48.410 --> 00:25:50.180
<v Speaker 2>But not as much though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably would be over half.</v>

633
00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It won't be over half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

634
00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:53.270
<v Speaker 2>You go to your 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somethings over,</v>

635
00:25:53.271 --> 00:25:54.350
<v Speaker 2>half will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

636
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

637
00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:59.120
<v Speaker 2>because they're making the same mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that many people may 18,</v>

638
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.730
<v Speaker 2>1916 they're not making a 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>26,</v>

639
00:26:01.731 --> 00:26:02.564
<v Speaker 2>28 this was also not a rights of passage</v>
<v Speaker 2>things though thing that actually </v>

640
00:26:05.631 --> 00:26:07.550
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would actually be that.</v>

641
00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:11.150
<v Speaker 2>They'd have to make that choice at 16 </v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's the issue.</v>

642
00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 2>How do I pay for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this covers the entire sheet of what</v>

643
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:14.510
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the next question I get.</v>

644
00:26:14.511 --> 00:26:16.070
<v Speaker 2>How you paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York state says,</v>

645
00:26:16.071 --> 00:26:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I have to pay for a full 12 years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

646
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.060
<v Speaker 2>Have to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pay for it.</v>

647
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.070
<v Speaker 2>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a marine.</v>

648
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.520
<v Speaker 2>When I got in Marine Corps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a Gi bill x dollars,</v>

649
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I think it was $100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot what it was back then.</v>

650
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.830
<v Speaker 2>This was in the 90s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

651
00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.800
<v Speaker 2>I think at $100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 10 years to use it,</v>

652
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.760
<v Speaker 2>we're going to give all of our kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>$20,000 and five years to use it.</v>

653
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:35.653
<v Speaker 2>They don't get the physical check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the state will pay a check to </v>

654
00:26:37.551 --> 00:26:39.950
<v Speaker 2>whatever school they want to go to for </v>
<v Speaker 2>$20,000.</v>

655
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:41.840
<v Speaker 2>They have five years to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where does that mean?</v>

656
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 2>You can at 16 slow experimenting.</v>

657
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:45.241
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

658
00:26:45.241 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I know college is for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna go to prep school.</v>

659
00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I promise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise you this,</v>

660
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.570
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any amount of money you want,</v>

661
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.790
<v Speaker 1>promise you this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as this comes into play,</v>

662
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:54.833
<v Speaker 1>you will find tons of all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>prep schools and trade schools the pop </v>

663
00:26:58.421 --> 00:27:00.540
<v Speaker 1>up and guess how much they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost for two years,</v>

664
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.870
<v Speaker 1>$20,000 that's going to be a tuition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

665
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:04.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

666
00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

667
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.130
<v Speaker 1>We're paying $44,000 now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If each of those kids,</v>

668
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 1>we're saving $24,000 per kid and giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>them better schooling,</v>

669
00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.080
<v Speaker 1>more accurate actual choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can learn something.</v>

670
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.033
<v Speaker 1>They make their mistakes at 1617 which </v>
<v Speaker 1>is way better than 26 or 27 and maybe </v>

671
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 1>they figure out they want to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it so cheap?</v>

672
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:25.614
<v Speaker 1>Why are you going to be able to do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for $20,000 when it costs so much more </v>

673
00:27:28.381 --> 00:27:28.740
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>

674
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.470
<v Speaker 1>What's going to be different that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be choosing,</v>

675
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:32.851
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

676
00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:34.980
<v Speaker 1>so the people that are educating these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

677
00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are they going to get paid?</v>

678
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the money gonna come from?</v>

679
00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

680
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:41.010
<v Speaker 1>a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember teachers ask me all the time,</v>

681
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:41.844
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>

682
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.710
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to help us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what I tell you.</v>

683
00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get rid of a bunch of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators in New York state.</v>

684
00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:50.700
<v Speaker 1>We actually have school districts that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have more administrators than teachers.</v>

685
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:51.930
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

686
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.330
<v Speaker 1>that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want homework?</v>

687
00:27:53.331 --> 00:27:55.530
<v Speaker 1>What's the value of having </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators?</v>

688
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Because you have to check boxes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

689
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to check boxes for coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you do x that you do?</v>

690
00:28:00.241 --> 00:28:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Why did you do z?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These administers required,</v>

691
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.750
<v Speaker 1>that's what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

692
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:06.500
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's about $60 billion in our budget.</v>

693
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:07.353
<v Speaker 1>New York state for education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give or take about 4 billion comes from </v>

694
00:28:09.541 --> 00:28:10.374
<v Speaker 1>the federal government.</v>

695
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.650
<v Speaker 1>About 35 billion comes from the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>and about 20 billion comes locally,</v>

696
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.513
<v Speaker 1>give or take it to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are round numbers and they change </v>

697
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 1>yearly depending on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

698
00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:18.690
<v Speaker 1>on who you talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about that.</v>

699
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Once we get rid of the federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

700
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:22.950
<v Speaker 1>being involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

701
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:23.784
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York state for being [inaudible] </v>

702
00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.210
<v Speaker 1>goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get afraid.</v>

703
00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lose that money.</v>

704
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

705
00:28:30.001 --> 00:28:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Let it go away because all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ministers go away.</v>

706
00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can give her a three,</v>

707
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:34.321
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

708
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:36.060
<v Speaker 1>six administrators for every one or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers,</v>

709
00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:38.460
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good nutritional educator,</v>

710
00:28:38.461 --> 00:28:41.940
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine that if I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be upset at this.</v>

711
00:28:41.941 --> 00:28:42.774
<v Speaker 1>I would say that there's a reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>those administrators are there and we </v>

712
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:46.464
<v Speaker 1>need them to take some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative weight off of the </v>

713
00:28:48.061 --> 00:28:48.894
<v Speaker 1>teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teachers are stressed out enough by </v>

714
00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:51.144
<v Speaker 1>teaching students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the time to be taken </v>

715
00:28:53.071 --> 00:28:53.904
<v Speaker 1>care of.</v>

716
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.580
<v Speaker 1>All the formalities and the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these administrators too.</v>

717
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.713
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have never heard that ever because </v>

718
00:28:59.551 --> 00:29:00.384
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the first person that ever said </v>

719
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.720
<v Speaker 1>to me ever in over a year of me doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

720
00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:05.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason is those with you?</v>

721
00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:06.541
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

722
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:06.930
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

723
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Not every teacher said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never heard it.</v>

724
00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.950
<v Speaker 1>You never heard it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talked to a lot of,</v>

725
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:13.380
<v Speaker 1>lots of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dozens of them does.</v>

726
00:29:13.381 --> 00:29:15.540
<v Speaker 1>What did they say about administrating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say awesome.</v>

727
00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Not In those words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

728
00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:19.973
<v Speaker 1>because most of those administrators are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually administrating teachers that </v>

729
00:29:22.821 --> 00:29:23.910
<v Speaker 1>teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them how to teach,</v>

730
00:29:23.911 --> 00:29:24.990
<v Speaker 1>what to teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when to teach,</v>

731
00:29:24.991 --> 00:29:26.400
<v Speaker 1>grading them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they don't,</v>

732
00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:28.020
<v Speaker 1>who will the parents?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

733
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.550
<v Speaker 1>the parents will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

734
00:29:29.551 --> 00:29:30.384
<v Speaker 1>You think the parents have the time or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding of what an education </v>

735
00:29:33.511 --> 00:29:37.230
<v Speaker 1>should comprise of to be able to direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just their,</v>

736
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.840
<v Speaker 1>their student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their child needs,</v>

737
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.913
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of 50 or however large the </v>

738
00:29:43.061 --> 00:29:43.450
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

739
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 1>Great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And generally speaking?</v>

740
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But teachers do.</v>

741
00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Teachers too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to self police.</v>

742
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.300
<v Speaker 1>There'll be some administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

743
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you're assuming that I'm going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of all administrators?</v>

744
00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:54.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

745
00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.370
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

746
00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

747
00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.480
<v Speaker 1>but you're definitely saying you went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>school though.</v>

748
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.670
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went to school.</v>

749
00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.103
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember how many vice principals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were any of your schools you </v>

750
00:30:04.331 --> 00:30:05.210
<v Speaker 1>remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

751
00:30:05.211 --> 00:30:06.044
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably two or three that was normal </v>

752
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.850
<v Speaker 1>and met most schools when I was his </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

753
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:11.890
<v Speaker 1>Often it was two or three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

754
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Now there's 12 1210 40 why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

755
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:20.140
<v Speaker 1>Because their administrators and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure other things,</v>

756
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:24.070
<v Speaker 1>they're making sure boxes are checked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's your alternative.</v>

757
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 1>You're alternative is keep funding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>broken system and be afraid,</v>

758
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:29.980
<v Speaker 1>which is what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

759
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:30.814
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying teachers will be afraid </v>

760
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:33.070
<v Speaker 1>because I'm afraid.</v>

761
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:33.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then Hio Frey who educated our </v>

762
00:30:35.291 --> 00:30:36.041
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

763
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:37.240
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overwhelmed.</v>

764
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Overwhelmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

765
00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Fear of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being overwhelmed.</v>

766
00:30:39.821 --> 00:30:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Not just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just that,</v>

767
00:30:41.201 --> 00:30:45.940
<v Speaker 1>but also like having a mandate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like having,</v>

768
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very strict,</v>

769
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curriculum.</v>

770
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:51.063
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See she's children and that is nothing </v>

771
00:30:52.031 --> 00:30:52.864
<v Speaker 1>but a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you real fast if you </v>

772
00:30:54.131 --> 00:30:54.964
<v Speaker 1>don't mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you a list of all the time </v>

773
00:30:56.561 --> 00:30:57.394
<v Speaker 1>centralized control has worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finished centralized control doesn't </v>

774
00:31:01.721 --> 00:31:02.554
<v Speaker 1>work in in education meaning what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In anything when a centralized control </v>

775
00:31:06.471 --> 00:31:08.980
<v Speaker 1>and make things better defined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>centralized control,</v>

776
00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:12.610
<v Speaker 1>a strict mandate from Albany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strict mandate from DC.</v>

777
00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

778
00:31:14.121 --> 00:31:14.954
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming you're old enough that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in school at one point at 1980 or </v>

779
00:31:17.951 --> 00:31:19.390
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

780
00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Or before I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

781
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Prior to 1980 basically the partner of </v>
<v Speaker 1>education didn't really exist as it does</v>

782
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:25.390
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

783
00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:27.520
<v Speaker 1>It did exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was basically as a repository for</v>

784
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:28.354
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't really do anything and I </v>

785
00:31:29.081 --> 00:31:32.170
<v Speaker 1>didn't have any power since that's an 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to have power.</v>

786
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Do this and we'll give you money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't do this.</v>

787
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't give you money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are your rules.</v>

788
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:37.684
<v Speaker 1>Follow them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We punish you that that's what they are </v>

789
00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:42.520
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn to read and write.</v>

790
00:31:42.910 --> 00:31:46.150
<v Speaker 1>You learn to function in society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so die somehow.</v>

791
00:31:46.151 --> 00:31:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Every American prior 1980 when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>school learn how to read and write,</v>

792
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.130
<v Speaker 1>learn how to function in society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow it worked.</v>

793
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Do I trust the administrator or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher?</v>

794
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:55.443
<v Speaker 1>I would rather trust the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now does that mean they'd be no </v>

795
00:31:57.491 --> 00:31:58.840
<v Speaker 1>ministers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course then there'll be a minister.</v>

796
00:31:58.841 --> 00:31:59.674
<v Speaker 1>Of course they will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be still principles and things </v>

797
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:03.370
<v Speaker 1>of that sort of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the differences,</v>

798
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.230
<v Speaker 1>an administrator cares about checking a </v>
<v Speaker 1>box,</v>

799
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:07.323
<v Speaker 1>check a box.</v>

800
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Your cigarettes aren't better off </v>
<v Speaker 1>because boxes are checked.</v>

801
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.463
<v Speaker 1>You said it's a better off because these</v>
<v Speaker 1>students are getting better and because </v>

802
00:32:13.361 --> 00:32:14.620
<v Speaker 1>the parents are happier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

803
00:32:14.621 --> 00:32:16.660
<v Speaker 1>but when you're saying boxes being </v>
<v Speaker 1>checked,</v>

804
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:17.494
<v Speaker 1>that means things being covered that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they feel the signet for a standardized </v>

805
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:20.740
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

806
00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.270
<v Speaker 1>You two said that they feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>

807
00:32:22.271 --> 00:32:23.104
<v Speaker 1>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

808
00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's someone,</v>

809
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how curriculums are set up,</v>

810
00:32:28.211 --> 00:32:29.044
<v Speaker 1>but I would imagine that people get </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and they decide that children </v>

811
00:32:31.091 --> 00:32:32.830
<v Speaker 1>need to have a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>

812
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.480
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with grammar.</v>

813
00:32:34.580 --> 00:32:35.413
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain amount of understanding of </v>

814
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Speaker 1>mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

815
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

816
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about</v>

817
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.280
<v Speaker 2>teachers and the local administrators </v>
<v Speaker 2>and how about the local PTA?</v>

818
00:32:43.281 --> 00:32:45.180
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So less administrators,</v>

819
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 2>an elimination of administered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never said that,</v>

820
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:48.913
<v Speaker 2>so I didn't say you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do we decide how many </v>

821
00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:53.540
<v Speaker 2>administrators are necessary and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many can you cut out?</v>

822
00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 2>How much money can you save this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is even better.</v>

823
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.190
<v Speaker 2>You know that you're going to love my </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian ways on this one.</v>

824
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Right now what happens is there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>convoluted way of deciding house.</v>

825
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 2>What a convoluted way I thought he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>come loaded.</v>

826
00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:07.850
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be,</v>

827
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.073
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it alluded and convoluted </v>

828
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.233
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a new word and I don't </v>

829
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 2>think it should be used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

830
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.260
<v Speaker 2>is that new?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

831
00:33:15.261 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>not convoluted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other ones I'm loaded.</v>

832
00:33:17.691 --> 00:33:18.770
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

833
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure as a fetish there somewhere.</v>

834
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just haven't heard of me there.</v>

835
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.640
<v Speaker 2>See you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're ready to go now.</v>

836
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.900
<v Speaker 2>So there's a calm that a way of actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>of funding these schools.</v>

837
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:31.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to be very simple.</v>

838
00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.580
<v Speaker 2>I want a flat fee to come from the state</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

839
00:33:34.581 --> 00:33:36.350
<v Speaker 2>district,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on how many kids you have,</v>

840
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.540
<v Speaker 2>here's your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

841
00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality of it is there are about,</v>

842
00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:41.744
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 700 school districts in New York </v>

843
00:33:43.011 --> 00:33:43.850
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>

844
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.500
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

845
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.363
<v Speaker 2>It is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what happens now is there's your </v>

846
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:49.184
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them are going to make no </v>

847
00:33:50.241 --> 00:33:52.760
<v Speaker 2>changes because they're gonna be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like anything else.</v>

848
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.890
<v Speaker 2>There'll be early adopters and early </v>
<v Speaker 2>adopters are going to say,</v>

849
00:33:54.891 --> 00:33:57.470
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the federal government isn't going to</v>

850
00:33:57.471 --> 00:33:59.570
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The state government isn't telling us to</v>

851
00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:00.404
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

852
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 2>So we can change some things here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you say,</v>

853
00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:03.224
<v Speaker 2>here's your money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to get less money than </v>

854
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 2>they're getting now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends.</v>

855
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.810
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the school district.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll somewhat there.</v>

856
00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you'll have less jobs </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

857
00:34:11.631 --> 00:34:14.760
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have to decide whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>or not minnis traitors.</v>

858
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.310
<v Speaker 2>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>

859
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're saying,</v>

860
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:19.340
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's scary.</v>

861
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Some of our school districts will fail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

862
00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:23.120
<v Speaker 2>But in New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all failing now.</v>

863
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:26.300
<v Speaker 2>So I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the trailers in mass right now,</v>

864
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:27.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me finish.</v>

865
00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:28.803
<v Speaker 2>Please go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want government to be what you </v>

866
00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:32.750
<v Speaker 2>always hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

867
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elections have consequences.</v>

868
00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:36.163
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I now get to impose my will upon </v>

869
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 2>all of you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I won.</v>

870
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 2>So what I say goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm supposed to know everything,</v>

871
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:45.320
<v Speaker 2>be everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create boards and make things happen.</v>

872
00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I instead want to be the guy who when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have trouble,</v>

873
00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:50.083
<v Speaker 2>I can help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as school districts begin to have </v>

874
00:34:52.551 --> 00:34:53.384
<v Speaker 2>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will without question try to help </v>

875
00:34:54.951 --> 00:34:55.900
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I wrote,</v>

876
00:34:55.910 --> 00:34:58.820
<v Speaker 2>but there's 700 that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you have time to do that?</v>

877
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.470
<v Speaker 2>I won't personally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll have people who would have,</v>

878
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 2>right now there's already an </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure to handle that already.</v>

879
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:05.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to create a new one already</v>
<v Speaker 2>exists,</v>

880
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.200
<v Speaker 2>but right now it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's making up reasons to punish people.</v>

881
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it to make it reasons to </v>
<v Speaker 2>punish people.</v>

882
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:12.950
<v Speaker 2>I want instead to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

883
00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.290
<v Speaker 2>this school district is lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we help?</v>

884
00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.500
<v Speaker 2>I only have one string attached to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

885
00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:21.020
<v Speaker 2>I give only one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is transparency.</v>

886
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.243
<v Speaker 2>As I told you before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a business guy and here's what I </v>

887
00:35:23.301 --> 00:35:24.134
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an actual equation that works </v>

888
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:26.870
<v Speaker 2>every single time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very simple,</v>

889
00:35:26.871 --> 00:35:30.140
<v Speaker 2>simple equation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal freedom plus transparency,</v>

890
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:34.430
<v Speaker 2>plus accountability equals innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we do that,</v>

891
00:35:34.431 --> 00:35:35.264
<v Speaker 2>the other doctors will come on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will find great ways of making </v>

892
00:35:37.231 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>things work.</v>

893
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.450
<v Speaker 1>They will get rid of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrators,</v>

894
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.610
<v Speaker 1>they will get rid of some teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will hire new ones.</v>

895
00:35:41.611 --> 00:35:43.530
<v Speaker 1>They will decide which one should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>given raises.</v>

896
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.790
<v Speaker 1>That will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

897
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.080
<v Speaker 1>those after you there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please go ahead.</v>

898
00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:46.914
<v Speaker 1>Because what you're saying may work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of business because people </v>

899
00:35:50.671 --> 00:35:51.504
<v Speaker 1>have incentive to succeed in business </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that extensive is monetary success </v>

900
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.970
<v Speaker 1>when he always monetary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes.</v>

901
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not always,</v>

902
00:35:58.681 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

903
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about a school,</v>

904
00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.753
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you cut the funding for the school </v>

905
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:05.341
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

906
00:36:05.341 --> 00:36:06.174
<v Speaker 1>figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys decide how many administrators </v>

907
00:36:08.491 --> 00:36:10.800
<v Speaker 1>you want to keep art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The administrators',</v>

908
00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:13.680
<v Speaker 1>essentially the bosses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't they the ones who are in control?</v>

909
00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're not going to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own jobs,</v>

910
00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:16.763
<v Speaker 1>so what are they going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to pay the teachers last </v>

911
00:36:18.261 --> 00:36:20.730
<v Speaker 1>and they going to get an inferior </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers and it's a great question.</v>

912
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Ramp up their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their control of the,</v>

913
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:25.950
<v Speaker 1>of the cashflow because they realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's less of it.</v>

914
00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:26.843
<v Speaker 1>It is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great question and here's the </v>

915
00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:29.340
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen overnight.</v>

916
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I went in November and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

917
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.560
<v Speaker 1>All the money's gone to how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went in November.</v>

918
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.590
<v Speaker 1>People know what the plan is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start talking about it already.</v>

919
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.720
<v Speaker 1>We start bringing parents on board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We said,</v>

920
00:36:39.721 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 1>coming up with plans already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plans,</v>

921
00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:41.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

922
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:43.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like any other organization.</v>

923
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:44.730
<v Speaker 1>You're saying business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

924
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:45.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this works in military.</v>

925
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.360
<v Speaker 1>This works in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this works in business.</v>

926
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:49.620
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Works and everything.</v>

927
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:50.454
<v Speaker 1>What's your family?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if you knew that six </v>

928
00:36:53.521 --> 00:36:56.700
<v Speaker 1>months from now you're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sniff and decrease in your income.</v>

929
00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 1>You would start to make change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Typically,</v>

930
00:36:58.681 --> 00:37:00.720
<v Speaker 1>if there was someone above you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>

931
00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:02.490
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a decrease in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>

932
00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.280
<v Speaker 1>How do we make this work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we do?</v>

933
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.630
<v Speaker 1>If someone's there to guide you and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>already have infrastructure there,</v>

934
00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:10.553
<v Speaker 1>you'll begin to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My fear would be that they would have </v>

935
00:37:13.591 --> 00:37:16.590
<v Speaker 1>less teachers and then we have larger </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

936
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Totally possible administrators because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in control.</v>

937
00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.490
<v Speaker 1>People don't like to give up control and</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

938
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's actually in control with the PTA?</v>

939
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.393
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parent teachers association can and </v>

940
00:37:27.110 --> 00:37:29.880
<v Speaker 1>have a lot to heat to the board to sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>boards would decide,</v>

941
00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:32.720
<v Speaker 1>but they would have to agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

942
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.060
<v Speaker 1>They want to get rid of administrators </v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they didn't universally,</v>

943
00:37:36.061 --> 00:37:36.894
<v Speaker 1>if they didn't universally across the </v>
<v Speaker 1>board in this fails miserably and then </v>

944
00:37:39.361 --> 00:37:42.300
<v Speaker 1>classes get larger and then kids get </v>
<v Speaker 1>less attention.</v>

945
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the already Piss poor education</v>

946
00:37:45.541 --> 00:37:49.470
<v Speaker 1>system sinks further into the abyss and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have two choices.</v>

947
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.423
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be afraid of that and stay a </v>

948
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:55.164
<v Speaker 1>hostage to a terrible system that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>working as failing our kids and making </v>

949
00:37:57.751 --> 00:37:58.360
<v Speaker 1>us in happiness.</v>

950
00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.193
<v Speaker 1>Jordan estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's option one or option to do that </v>

951
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.050
<v Speaker 1>and just watch over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

952
00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Understanding that that could happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those were the only two options.</v>

953
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.210
<v Speaker 1>These other options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other option is yes,</v>

954
00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.610
<v Speaker 1>funded more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

955
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.590
<v Speaker 1>fuck a bad system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

956
00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:15.250
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

957
00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.630
<v Speaker 1>If you had a 10 what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with the system?</v>

958
00:38:18.631 --> 00:38:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's go over that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just told you.</v>

959
00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

960
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.280
<v Speaker 1>but I mean in terms of like how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money are they making,</v>

961
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:27.210
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what would increasing that amount of</v>

962
00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:30.000
<v Speaker 1>money enhance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

963
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.133
<v Speaker 1>Two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the first thing is there's no </v>

964
00:38:33.511 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>way in the world that a governor</v>

965
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 2>should be deciding what every teacher </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes an estate.</v>

966
00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just philosophically wrong,</v>

967
00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:44.800
<v Speaker 2>so I'm never going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is simply philosophically wrong.</v>

968
00:38:44.801 --> 00:38:46.810
<v Speaker 2>It's against who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Centralize,</v>

969
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.570
<v Speaker 2>centralize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Control was a bad idea.</v>

970
00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Localized control is always a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea for,</v>

971
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 2>so that's so that that premise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to even touch that.</v>

972
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.780
<v Speaker 2>What I'm trying to achieve here is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make change.</v>

973
00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.153
<v Speaker 2>I know that locally there will be people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do it right because that always </v>

974
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:05.890
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just how it works.</v>

975
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.420
<v Speaker 2>You will see out of seven districts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of it decide to to,</v>

976
00:39:09.550 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get together and,</v>

977
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:12.130
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and mix this together.</v>

978
00:39:12.131 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 2>Some will decide not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some will do different things.</v>

979
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:17.530
<v Speaker 2>You'll see it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is this is a major overhaul.</v>

980
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:18.740
<v Speaker 2>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

981
00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Businesses there all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Families do all the time.</v>

982
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:22.053
<v Speaker 2>If you're able to watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be the mother or the </v>

983
00:39:26.501 --> 00:39:27.460
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

984
00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Democrats won't be your mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't to give you everything,</v>

985
00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.870
<v Speaker 2>going to be a father and protect you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from everything.</v>

986
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:33.003
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brother,</v>

987
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.930
<v Speaker 2>let me to get you love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to live with them,</v>

988
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.610
<v Speaker 2>but you love him and when you need a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ride to the airport,</v>

989
00:39:37.611 --> 00:39:39.640
<v Speaker 2>he's there for you and with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>firefighter,</v>

990
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.140
<v Speaker 2>the guy who comes to help when you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

991
00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Now you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Larry is good.</v>

992
00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:44.014
<v Speaker 2>This will fail.</v>

993
00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want them saying,</v>

994
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:46.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

995
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.130
<v Speaker 1>some might fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's you're saying some,</v>

996
00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.860
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even saying they might fail.</v>

997
00:39:49.861 --> 00:39:52.830
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put them in a compromised situation.</v>

998
00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to give them less money and</v>

999
00:39:54.721 --> 00:39:56.310
<v Speaker 1>you're going to say figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1000
00:39:56.311 --> 00:39:57.144
<v Speaker 1>but not just see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're assuming that it's just here's </v>

1001
00:39:59.611 --> 00:40:00.570
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

1002
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:01.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's less money.</v>

1003
00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's less money.</v>

1004
00:40:03.121 --> 00:40:03.954
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have too many </v>

1005
00:40:04.441 --> 00:40:05.470
<v Speaker 1>administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1006
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:09.030
<v Speaker 1>And let's talk this out over a series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>several months.</v>

1007
00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:09.864
<v Speaker 1>When you talk to professional educators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they agree that they have too many </v>

1008
00:40:11.881 --> 00:40:14.580
<v Speaker 1>administrators do money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1009
00:40:14.581 --> 00:40:16.500
<v Speaker 1>So far everything's your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met everyone,</v>

1010
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.260
<v Speaker 1>but they agree they do well with less </v>
<v Speaker 1>money if they didn't have to.</v>

1011
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:20.103
<v Speaker 1>Miniaturize is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how much less money are we talking </v>

1012
00:40:21.571 --> 00:40:23.100
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure to be fair with you.</v>

1013
00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.113
<v Speaker 1>Not sure yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the one show you that you feel </v>

1014
00:40:25.531 --> 00:40:26.364
<v Speaker 1>like the way to fix the education system</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the cut funding that would like for </v>

1015
00:40:30.491 --> 00:40:33.000
<v Speaker 1>people like me who are on the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear that and you go,</v>

1016
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.863
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already feel like teachers are </v>

1017
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:39.900
<v Speaker 1>underappreciated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And probably because of that unmotivated</v>

1018
00:40:39.901 --> 00:40:42.960
<v Speaker 1>because you decided to say the answer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut funding.</v>

1019
00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.330
<v Speaker 1>It's not what I saw on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1020
00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:44.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1021
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:45.523
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started this of what you were </v>

1022
00:40:46.381 --> 00:40:46.980
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1023
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Regardless of what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is currently,</v>

1024
00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in California,</v>

1025
00:40:51.421 --> 00:40:52.300
<v Speaker 1>forget about New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1026
00:40:52.380 --> 00:40:55.080
<v Speaker 1>I feel like teachers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>underappreciated.</v>

1027
00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:55.973
<v Speaker 1>I would agree with that and I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a noble profession that's </v>

1028
00:40:58.651 --> 00:41:01.950
<v Speaker 1>incredibly valuable and the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be able to make a decent living.</v>

1029
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Agreed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how.</v>

1030
00:41:03.211 --> 00:41:06.450
<v Speaker 1>The solution to that is to give less </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to the school.</v>

1031
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.800
<v Speaker 2>You're missing a very valid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important point.</v>

1032
00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:12.010
<v Speaker 2>If you ask most teachers whether </v>
<v Speaker 2>underappreciated,</v>

1033
00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:13.033
<v Speaker 2>most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to say that people </v>

1034
00:41:14.061 --> 00:41:16.730
<v Speaker 2>like you and I don't appreciate them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to say,</v>

1035
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.713
<v Speaker 2>the system doesn't appreciate me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're always fighting the </v>

1036
00:41:19.701 --> 00:41:20.810
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oklahoma,</v>

1037
00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.540
<v Speaker 2>they fought the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They always fighting the system.</v>

1038
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:28.600
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is fix the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system is heavily controlled in many</v>

1039
00:41:28.611 --> 00:41:30.800
<v Speaker 2>cases by the federal government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>$4 billion worth,</v>

1040
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:31.873
<v Speaker 2>so we have to lose $4 billion unless we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless we want to keep the federal </v>

1041
00:41:34.701 --> 00:41:37.310
<v Speaker 2>government in our system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want that.</v>

1042
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:41.370
<v Speaker 2>Your fix is to let them figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the federal government out.</v>

1043
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them figure it out with less money.</v>

1044
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:44.870
<v Speaker 2>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to push back here.</v>

1045
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:45.671
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1046
00:41:45.671 --> 00:41:46.504
<v Speaker 2>you keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let him figure it out as if I'm just </v>

1047
00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:49.880
<v Speaker 2>going to walk away and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well good luck.</v>

1048
00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.620
<v Speaker 2>I hope I'm going to go off and now you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1049
00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:53.840
<v Speaker 2>hang out in Puerto Rico for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1050
00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying I'm gonna facilitate it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know what I do.</v>

1051
00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.820
<v Speaker 2>I trust teachers more than twice </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrators.</v>

1052
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.210
<v Speaker 2>I trust the local people that if I give </v>
<v Speaker 2>them the right tools,</v>

1053
00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.690
<v Speaker 2>they'll do the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly they'll show others</v>

1054
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:06.703
<v Speaker 2>as also transparent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's going to happen is they're going </v>

1055
00:42:08.491 --> 00:42:10.310
<v Speaker 2>to figure out the right way to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers.</v>

1056
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:14.110
<v Speaker 2>Should should school district one hire </v>
<v Speaker 2>more Spanish teachers versus going stick</v>

1057
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.530
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1058
00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.393
<v Speaker 2>I'm not supposed to know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do and if they make a mistake </v>

1059
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:21.350
<v Speaker 2>then they'll fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then other counties,</v>

1060
00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:22.843
<v Speaker 2>are you talking about the teachers </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves or are you talking about </v>

1061
00:42:25.341 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 2>these administrators who you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminate?</v>

1062
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the school boards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the school board.</v>

1063
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.350
<v Speaker 2>The school boards are going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones with the,</v>

1064
00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.660
<v Speaker 2>with the PTA.</v>

1065
00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:39.580
<v Speaker 2>If we make this work the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be everyone talking together.</v>

1066
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:42.860
<v Speaker 2>It will be school boards talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>administrators,</v>

1067
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:44.660
<v Speaker 2>talking to teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk with parents.</v>

1068
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:49.670
<v Speaker 2>I don't want schools graded beat by </v>
<v Speaker 2>standardized tests.</v>

1069
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.460
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing that for years and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have very,</v>

1070
00:42:52.461 --> 00:42:54.650
<v Speaker 2>very unhappy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unhappy Students,</v>

1071
00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.740
<v Speaker 2>unhappy parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want parents to be happier.</v>

1072
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I want students to be happier and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might say,</v>

1073
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 2>but then Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they won't learn certain things.</v>

1074
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:02.623
<v Speaker 2>Is that a horrible thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather than be happy than learn ap </v>

1075
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:08.030
<v Speaker 2>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1076
00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:09.163
<v Speaker 2>If that means one school decides that ap</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry isn't that important in a </v>

1077
00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:12.920
<v Speaker 2>school district,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

1078
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:13.783
<v Speaker 2>Those kids will learn it in the prep </v>
<v Speaker 2>school and some kids won't learn ap </v>

1079
00:43:16.161 --> 00:43:16.994
<v Speaker 2>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that makes your school district </v>

1080
00:43:17.751 --> 00:43:18.584
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with that because it goes to </v>

1081
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:20.744
<v Speaker 2>the next level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course becomes kids with </v>

1082
00:43:22.281 --> 00:43:23.114
<v Speaker 2>special needs.</v>

1083
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.330
<v Speaker 2>You have a special needs kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you make that kid happy?</v>

1084
00:43:26.331 --> 00:43:27.980
<v Speaker 2>How do you decide whether a kid kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful or not?</v>

1085
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.160
<v Speaker 2>The standardized testing doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do?</v>

1086
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:33.260
<v Speaker 2>These are doing check boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does that work?</v>

1087
00:43:33.261 --> 00:43:34.094
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you literally have hundreds </v>

1088
00:43:35.061 --> 00:43:37.580
<v Speaker 2>of parents every single year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in New York state,</v>

1089
00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:38.414
<v Speaker 2>because they were unhappy with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids getting services but not getting </v>

1090
00:43:40.191 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want your kid getting better.</v>

1091
00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:44.373
<v Speaker 2>You're assuming that because the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government puts these standards in it </v>

1092
00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:48.500
<v Speaker 2>that makes them good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

1093
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:49.850
<v Speaker 2>If anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes them worse.</v>

1094
00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.360
<v Speaker 2>If kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my kids are happy,</v>

1095
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:57.020
<v Speaker 2>that's what I want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happy New Yorkers means they stay in New</v>

1096
00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:57.853
<v Speaker 2>York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Happy New Yorkers means they grow their </v>

1097
00:43:59.001 --> 00:44:00.970
<v Speaker 2>businesses in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep their families in there.</v>

1098
00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:01.813
<v Speaker 2>I get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but saying happy and saying that </v>

1099
00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:04.514
<v Speaker 2>solution and the key to happiness is </v>
<v Speaker 2>funding them less and getting rid of </v>

1100
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:11.240
<v Speaker 2>administering goggling the Democrat Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the Democrat.</v>

1101
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God you are so a Democrat.</v>

1102
00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:14.593
<v Speaker 2>How am I a democrat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got [inaudible] being the world's </v>

1103
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:18.800
<v Speaker 2>ending less funding means the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

1104
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.250
<v Speaker 2>People that hear that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>take money away from school.</v>

1105
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:23.084
<v Speaker 2>The person who only hears that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the person says all he's going to do </v>

1106
00:44:26.091 --> 00:44:28.940
<v Speaker 2>is get rid of money from schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that person's never going to vote</v>

1107
00:44:28.941 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That person's probably a democrat.</v>

1108
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.510
<v Speaker 2>That problem's person's going to vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Cuomo and that's fine.</v>

1109
00:44:33.511 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna win everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't win everybody,</v>

1110
00:44:35.460 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to change a system that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely broken.</v>

1111
00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:38.933
<v Speaker 2>If you say this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're talking about people talk </v>

1112
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:42.090
<v Speaker 2>about with the MTA also in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>City,</v>

1113
00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 2>the MTA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to keep funding the MTA.</v>

1114
00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:46.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be hostage to a shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1115
00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:48.690
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1116
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be hostage to a shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1117
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.170
<v Speaker 2>This is a terrible system that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>failing New Yorkers.</v>

1118
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.300
<v Speaker 2>That is failing people in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to the MTA,</v>

1119
00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:59.760
<v Speaker 2>that's fairly big state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's mass transit.</v>

1120
00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:00.361
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1121
00:45:00.361 --> 00:45:02.610
<v Speaker 2>If those of you are not in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bad system.</v>

1122
00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:04.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be a hostile because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>

1123
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.243
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will fight my jailer period and my </v>

1124
00:45:06.971 --> 00:45:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Jello is a system that is broken that </v>
<v Speaker 2>says if you,</v>

1125
00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.880
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better give me more money.</v>

1126
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.430
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it'll happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better give me more money.</v>

1127
00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise it will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1128
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.660
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fix that system.</v>

1129
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.990
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to help facilitate fixing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1130
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Am I just to let them go away?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that.</v>

1131
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.200
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is I'm going to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitate that system and to do that we</v>

1132
00:45:28.201 --> 00:45:30.450
<v Speaker 2>can lose $4 billion and we'll get over </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1133
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:31.740
<v Speaker 2>We'll fix that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll make it happen.</v>

1134
00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:32.723
<v Speaker 2>We'll make it work so by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you get more people into this </v>

1135
00:45:35.281 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 2>state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the most important piece,</v>

1136
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:38.723
<v Speaker 2>you can raise money through other ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just raising taxes on people and </v>

1137
00:45:42.061 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 2>this is the most critical piece when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear funding,</v>

1138
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:45.384
<v Speaker 2>and this is why I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was teasing you in Konya Democrat </v>

1139
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.630
<v Speaker 2>because we need to about funding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about more taxes.</v>

1140
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:49.913
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get more people to stay in New </v>

1141
00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.270
<v Speaker 2>York state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you raise your revenue without having to</v>

1142
00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:56.400
<v Speaker 2>raise taxes on anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you raise your revenue,</v>

1143
00:45:56.401 --> 00:45:58.530
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put more revenue into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools of course,</v>

1144
00:45:58.531 --> 00:45:59.970
<v Speaker 2>to be more people in the schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More reverent.</v>

1145
00:45:59.971 --> 00:46:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1146
00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:02.784
<v Speaker 2>Your money in the school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be more people in the schools </v>

1147
00:46:04.291 --> 00:46:06.480
<v Speaker 2>and more Morton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we would if we could.</v>

1148
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:07.920
<v Speaker 2>Re of course we would.</v>

1149
00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:09.173
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York state has $170 billion budget </v>

1150
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.690
<v Speaker 2>with about a $4 billion deficit and $300</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion in debt,</v>

1151
00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.170
<v Speaker 2>and the answer for every Democrat or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republican is more funding.</v>

1152
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:22.240
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This state is going to go different.</v>

1153
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:23.083
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to,</v>

1154
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:24.143
<v Speaker 2>it's going to go under in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you get more people to come to </v>

1155
00:46:26.161 --> 00:46:28.950
<v Speaker 2>the stair right first thing by having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really super court cases,</v>

1156
00:46:28.951 --> 00:46:32.670
<v Speaker 2>and I talked about super cool education </v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll get people to come back.</v>

1157
00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.940
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to hire someone to create </v>
<v Speaker 2>this super cool education system?</v>

1158
00:46:35.941 --> 00:46:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to let these teachers </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured it out on their own?</v>

1159
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:38.573
<v Speaker 2>If we need teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>build me a super cool education system </v>

1160
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:43.110
<v Speaker 2>so that we get more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I already have the,</v>

1161
00:46:43.170 --> 00:46:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I already have the infrastructure for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the super cool system.</v>

1162
00:46:45.871 --> 00:46:47.800
<v Speaker 2>I just told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've already told you what that,</v>

1163
00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:49.030
<v Speaker 2>what the instructor is done.</v>

1164
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 2>The concept or at a skeleton is already </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1165
00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.460
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once I win in November,</v>

1166
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.000
<v Speaker 2>we begin to build it out and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be me and other people be clear.</v>

1167
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not like New York doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

1168
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.173
<v Speaker 2>New York's doesn't have enough workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have tons of workers that we can </v>

1169
00:47:03.001 --> 00:47:07.170
<v Speaker 2>absolutely use to make this happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tons of them that if I'm not mistaken,</v>

1170
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 2>the New York state has the most by </v>
<v Speaker 2>percentage,</v>

1171
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government employees I think.</v>

1172
00:47:11.841 --> 00:47:13.920
<v Speaker 2>And I think in the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know we are the most unionized,</v>

1173
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:15.180
<v Speaker 2>but I think we're the most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1174
00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:16.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government employees by percentage.</v>

1175
00:47:16.831 --> 00:47:18.520
<v Speaker 2>You're going to move their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1176
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.280
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1177
00:47:20.281 --> 00:47:21.750
<v Speaker 2>let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love the idea.</v>

1178
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.913
<v Speaker 2>You're asking details that are simple to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix when the time comes and simple to </v>

1179
00:47:26.311 --> 00:47:27.144
<v Speaker 2>fix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're going to take people out of </v>

1180
00:47:28.321 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 2>what professions move them</v>

1181
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.460
<v Speaker 1>into fixing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually it beside it for every person</v>

1182
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:34.660
<v Speaker 1>in New York state where they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1183
00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm asking.</v>

1184
00:47:36.521 --> 00:47:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Of course not you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

1185
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:40.870
<v Speaker 1>you're doing it like a show now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing a show.</v>

1186
00:47:40.871 --> 00:47:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a democrat.</v>

1187
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a democrat.</v>

1188
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving,</v>

1189
00:47:45.131 --> 00:47:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just asking you a real clean </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions here.</v>

1190
00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.030
<v Speaker 1>You four times said you're going to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>money away,</v>

1191
00:47:52.150 --> 00:47:54.040
<v Speaker 1>but you are right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1192
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:58.990
<v Speaker 1>You've said like four times because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on about these other things,</v>

1193
00:47:58.991 --> 00:48:02.080
<v Speaker 1>which is what matters more than losing </v>
<v Speaker 1>$4 billion from education.</v>

1194
00:48:02.081 --> 00:48:02.914
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I just want to be clear about what </v>

1195
00:48:03.701 --> 00:48:04.534
<v Speaker 1>you're saying about what the actual </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to fix this system by creating a </v>

1196
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:11.680
<v Speaker 1>good skeleton off the bat that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to enjoy and like,</v>

1197
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:12.993
<v Speaker 1>and then once I went in November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to fill that skeleton up to </v>

1198
00:48:15.101 --> 00:48:18.400
<v Speaker 1>make an amazing school system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people can be proud of.</v>

1199
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.770
<v Speaker 1>They're going to want to bring their </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1200
00:48:19.771 --> 00:48:20.604
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna come back from North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolina that had come back from </v>

1201
00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to move from,</v>

1202
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.580
<v Speaker 1>from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be part of their system.</v>

1203
00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:29.800
<v Speaker 1>They're going to see schools that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually work well.</v>

1204
00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:31.720
<v Speaker 1>They're going to see prep schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get kids into college.</v>

1205
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:32.703
<v Speaker 1>They're going to see colleges that </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually educate kids and get them into </v>

1206
00:48:34.481 --> 00:48:36.310
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they see that happened,</v>

1207
00:48:36.311 --> 00:48:38.230
<v Speaker 1>that all start coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to happen.</v>

1208
00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.200
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen by me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I fund this?</v>

1209
00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:43.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen by me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being afraid of making a step.</v>

1210
00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.200
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have the perfect plan </v>
<v Speaker 1>to move forward.</v>

1211
00:48:47.590 --> 00:48:48.423
<v Speaker 1>No plan is perfect anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want a good solid plan with </v>

1212
00:48:51.611 --> 00:48:52.444
<v Speaker 1>motivated people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have motivated people to take up </v>

1213
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:56.890
<v Speaker 1>a plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll wind up being successful again,</v>

1214
00:48:56.891 --> 00:48:57.724
<v Speaker 1>it's how it works.</v>

1215
00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:59.103
<v Speaker 1>So this grandiose plan is I like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get rid of the last two </v>

1216
00:49:03.311 --> 00:49:08.311
<v Speaker 1>years of high school and you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>offer potential prep school for children</v>

1217
00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:12.130
<v Speaker 1>and you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for other kids,</v>

1218
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:14.050
<v Speaker 1>offer them trade schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

1219
00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Sure you're going to get rid of $4 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion in federal funding.</v>

1220
00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:18.653
<v Speaker 1>You're going to let the schools figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out how many administrators they should </v>

1221
00:49:21.641 --> 00:49:23.770
<v Speaker 1>have with help with help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with help,</v>

1222
00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.080
<v Speaker 1>and who wants to help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you going to hire it?</v>

1223
00:49:26.081 --> 00:49:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Oversee this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll figure it out.</v>

1224
00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.350
<v Speaker 1>You figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1225
00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:30.683
<v Speaker 1>I'm two months from the election away </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the election and then at least six </v>

1226
00:49:34.691 --> 00:49:36.290
<v Speaker 1>months reputation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1227
00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.650
<v Speaker 1>At least if I met,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably low,</v>

1228
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:39.484
<v Speaker 1>but mark nine put anytime this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something to play until next </v>

1229
00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:45.010
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1230
00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.300
<v Speaker 1>At earliest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1231
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:48.700
<v Speaker 1>The earliest thing coming to play is </v>
<v Speaker 1>next September.</v>

1232
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I hope it's that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be amazing.</v>

1233
00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:52.690
<v Speaker 1>I hope it is that fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't five minutes.</v>

1234
00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this so I can become king.</v>

1235
00:49:56.170 --> 00:49:58.360
<v Speaker 1>We already have a king and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in trouble.</v>

1236
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:59.140
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1237
00:49:59.140 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I want to give localized control many </v>
<v Speaker 1>more options.</v>

1238
00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:03.263
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the crazy guy who actually means </v>

1239
00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:07.330
<v Speaker 1>what he says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say let teachers teach,</v>

1240
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:08.463
<v Speaker 1>I actually mean that most people say it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they and their response then </v>

1241
00:50:12.251 --> 00:50:16.170
<v Speaker 1>becomes give more administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think what's stopping them now?</v>

1242
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Standardized tests and administrators </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then funding.</v>

1243
00:50:20.741 --> 00:50:24.370
<v Speaker 1>That's based on the success of the test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

1244
00:50:24.371 --> 00:50:26.890
<v Speaker 1>In the school district it's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is always more funding.</v>

1245
00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.220
<v Speaker 1>The is always more funding</v>

1246
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 2>and it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not that people always say we have</v>

1247
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:33.930
<v Speaker 2>to fund fund fund.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is not the answer there.</v>

1248
00:50:33.931 --> 00:50:36.020
<v Speaker 2>There are better answers out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there are.</v>

1249
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:37.700
<v Speaker 2>My main done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me go to the,</v>

1250
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:40.280
<v Speaker 2>to another piece on how to raise money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1251
00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.410
<v Speaker 2>The first thing is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I mentioned,</v>

1252
00:50:42.411 --> 00:50:44.150
<v Speaker 2>get more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If more people show up to the state,</v>

1253
00:50:44.151 --> 00:50:45.770
<v Speaker 2>New York state could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in theory,</v>

1254
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:46.813
<v Speaker 2>and this is theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easily hold 30 million people if they </v>

1255
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 2>the state could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's possible how many done the city?</v>

1256
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Seven is about eight and a half in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>city to say right now,</v>

1257
00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:57.680
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't happen to see right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a lot.</v>

1258
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.573
<v Speaker 2>It is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the largest city in the country by </v>

1259
00:51:00.501 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1260
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.260
<v Speaker 2>it's over double a Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles,</v>

1261
00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:04.730
<v Speaker 2>about three and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not mistaken.</v>

1262
00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Went down sort of La.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no end to it.</v>

1263
00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:09.201
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1264
00:51:09.201 --> 00:51:11.640
<v Speaker 2>if about LSD,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the metro area of,</v>

1265
00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:14.390
<v Speaker 2>of New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and New York City's had 16 million metro</v>

1266
00:51:14.391 --> 00:51:15.230
<v Speaker 2>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 million.</v>

1267
00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.160
<v Speaker 2>The actual city itself is a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1268
00:51:18.161 --> 00:51:20.030
<v Speaker 2>it's by far the largest city in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1269
00:51:20.031 --> 00:51:21.290
<v Speaker 2>in the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>

1270
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:23.840
<v Speaker 2>So it could in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take 30 million people.</v>

1271
00:51:23.841 --> 00:51:26.540
<v Speaker 2>It's possible if we get that amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1272
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.570
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1273
00:51:27.571 --> 00:51:29.200
<v Speaker 2>the tax revenue would be insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1274
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 2>But you can get people to move to New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York state by having a better state.</v>

1275
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:33.860
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things I mentioned was </v>
<v Speaker 2>education,</v>

1276
00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:34.970
<v Speaker 2>but there are several other things you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can do.</v>

1277
00:51:34.971 --> 00:51:35.804
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why aren't we supporting small </v>

1278
00:51:36.891 --> 00:51:37.724
<v Speaker 2>businesses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we don't know is that we punish </v>

1279
00:51:38.761 --> 00:51:39.531
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1280
00:51:39.531 --> 00:51:40.970
<v Speaker 2>We punish them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with licensing,</v>

1281
00:51:40.971 --> 00:51:42.380
<v Speaker 2>we punished him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In New York state,</v>

1282
00:51:42.381 --> 00:51:44.030
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a licensed to braid </v>
<v Speaker 2>hair.</v>

1283
00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 2>There's a license to walk a dog.</v>

1284
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:48.140
<v Speaker 2>There's all kind of license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The license to walk her dog.</v>

1285
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:49.003
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1286
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.750
<v Speaker 2>It's involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1287
00:51:50.751 --> 00:51:52.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a dog walker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1288
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:54.170
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There should be none here.</v>

1289
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Here's my rule and licensing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a good,</v>

1290
00:51:56.021 --> 00:51:57.020
<v Speaker 2>nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good general rule.</v>

1291
00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Would you ask your friend to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were a,</v>

1292
00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:01.384
<v Speaker 2>a a woman who had lots of long hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you ask your friend to braid your </v>

1293
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:06.350
<v Speaker 2>hair?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You probably would when you probably,</v>

1294
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.213
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably would.</v>

1295
00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.130
<v Speaker 2>If you had a dog and if you have a dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but assuming you have a dog,</v>

1296
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:11.270
<v Speaker 2>would you ask your friend to walk your </v>
<v Speaker 2>dog?</v>

1297
00:52:11.271 --> 00:52:11.841
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

1298
00:52:11.841 --> 00:52:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Of course you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is their license for that?</v>

1299
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Would you ask your friend to remove your</v>
<v Speaker 2>appendix?</v>

1300
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:21.530
<v Speaker 2>But I think the idea would be that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't want someone to screw it up,</v>

1301
00:52:21.531 --> 00:52:22.364
<v Speaker 2>so we'd want to make sure someone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance so that the consumer doesn't </v>

1302
00:52:25.101 --> 00:52:25.880
<v Speaker 2>get ripped off.</v>

1303
00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1304
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.660
<v Speaker 2>the appendix and you wouldn't let them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1305
00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:29.563
<v Speaker 2>Good license for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>

1306
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get a license for that.</v>

1307
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.960
<v Speaker 2>But your point's a valid one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about instead?</v>

1308
00:52:32.961 --> 00:52:35.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a difference between licensing </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what you just said,</v>

1309
00:52:35.421 --> 00:52:39.740
<v Speaker 2>which is insurance difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Licensing says the government decides if</v>

1310
00:52:39.741 --> 00:52:44.000
<v Speaker 2>you can or can't do it and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government will find you and or jail</v>

1311
00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:45.470
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a license.</v>

1312
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.710
<v Speaker 2>So you don't have to have hair braiding </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance or dog walker insurance.</v>

1313
00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.360
<v Speaker 2>You might want to have insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say that.</v>

1314
00:52:50.361 --> 00:52:51.770
<v Speaker 2>I said license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a difference.</v>

1315
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The assumption is,</v>

1316
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:54.434
<v Speaker 2>and you've made it by make that step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You made the assumption which is </v>

1317
00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:59.150
<v Speaker 2>licensing is for safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not that.</v>

1318
00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:00.900
<v Speaker 2>It's full control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all it's for.</v>

1319
00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.860
<v Speaker 2>The example I'll give you is vaping in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York state,</v>

1320
00:53:03.861 --> 00:53:05.420
<v Speaker 2>many calories you have to have a license</v>
<v Speaker 2>for vaping.</v>

1321
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:07.970
<v Speaker 2>So what does it likes his intestines to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell?</v>

1322
00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:08.621
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To sell that.</v>

1323
00:53:08.621 --> 00:53:09.660
<v Speaker 2>A vaping store?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1324
00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Have that because have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>license.</v>

1325
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.540
<v Speaker 2>They have a vaping store similar to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>of having a tobacco store similar.</v>

1326
00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:15.141
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1327
00:53:15.141 --> 00:53:16.310
<v Speaker 2>They do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>

1328
00:53:16.311 --> 00:53:17.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vaping a licensed,</v>

1329
00:53:17.341 --> 00:53:18.650
<v Speaker 2>it's grades for safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1330
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 2>Well does the person who has done the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vaping shit thought maybe,</v>

1331
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:22.394
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn CPR or understand the effects of </v>

1332
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.870
<v Speaker 2>nicotine in the body?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1333
00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:30.930
<v Speaker 2>They have to write a check if a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

1334
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:32.543
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no safety involved that the </v>

1335
00:53:35.251 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 2>license is approved for license.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

1336
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.370
<v Speaker 2>They can't be a felon with a history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraud.</v>

1337
00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if that's even the case in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the main thing,</v>

1338
00:53:43.531 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think in vaping that's not true.</v>

1339
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.310
<v Speaker 2>In certain cases there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true in certain,</v>

1340
00:53:47.370 --> 00:53:49.770
<v Speaker 2>but this is one tobacco controlled </v>
<v Speaker 2>substance.</v>

1341
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:50.693
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would assume that they do have to </v>

1342
00:53:51.721 --> 00:53:52.554
<v Speaker 2>have a license based on not being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>felon for tobacco prep until about </v>

1343
00:53:55.281 --> 00:53:56.150
<v Speaker 2>vaping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaping is,</v>

1344
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.930
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not.</v>

1345
00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1346
00:53:59.430 --> 00:54:00.810
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Tobacco,</v>

1347
00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:01.770
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some is.</v>

1348
00:54:01.771 --> 00:54:02.604
<v Speaker 2>Some is not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the stuffing is basically a is </v>

1349
00:54:04.921 --> 00:54:06.540
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a controlled substance?</v>

1350
00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:07.250
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1351
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:08.280
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicotine.</v>

1352
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:11.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>

1353
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:12.090
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tobacco was,</v>

1354
00:54:12.091 --> 00:54:17.091
<v Speaker 2>I know that's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If tobacco itself is the point,</v>

1355
00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:18.143
<v Speaker 2>active ingredient isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point of all of this is why is any </v>

1356
00:54:23.131 --> 00:54:26.310
<v Speaker 2>of it controlled and why is vaping </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled?</v>

1357
00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.030
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about safety and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me go to safety.</v>

1358
00:54:30.031 --> 00:54:32.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad you brought this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Safety.</v>

1359
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Everyone will tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>W W will tell me,</v>

1360
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:36.600
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>licensing is for safety.</v>

1361
00:54:36.601 --> 00:54:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Regulations is a for safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>

1362
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:40.020
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

1363
00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:41.640
<v Speaker 2>And then I'll give you the best example </v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you.</v>

1364
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:42.923
<v Speaker 2>Health food stores,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the healthiest people you know shop at </v>

1365
00:54:46.471 --> 00:54:47.304
<v Speaker 2>health food stores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is almost one is a health food </v>

1366
00:54:49.501 --> 00:54:50.334
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a store like a store where you </v>

1367
00:54:51.751 --> 00:54:53.520
<v Speaker 2>might go and buy vitamins that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1368
00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:58.550
<v Speaker 2>that's not GNC or store where you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>go and purchase organic things.</v>

1369
00:54:58.651 --> 00:55:01.860
<v Speaker 2>That's not a regular food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a whole foods.</v>

1370
00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Whole foods is similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the mom and pop health food store,</v>

1371
00:55:05.551 --> 00:55:08.220
<v Speaker 2>which generally speaking is usually </v>
<v Speaker 2>privately owned.</v>

1372
00:55:08.221 --> 00:55:10.110
<v Speaker 2>Usually it's kind of his thing from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past,</v>

1373
00:55:10.111 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Health food store.</v>

1374
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:12.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say that because most people </v>

1375
00:55:13.291 --> 00:55:16.830
<v Speaker 2>understand what I mean when I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you did not,</v>

1376
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.270
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But most people do understand.</v>

1377
00:55:18.271 --> 00:55:19.104
<v Speaker 2>When I say hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean basically a local store that was </v>

1378
00:55:20.191 --> 00:55:23.520
<v Speaker 2>some things like vitamins and it will </v>
<v Speaker 2>sell things like supplements.</v>

1379
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.430
<v Speaker 2>It'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a GNC is often,</v>

1380
00:55:26.431 --> 00:55:29.010
<v Speaker 2>often it's a mix of like a GNC and </v>
<v Speaker 2>grocery store,</v>

1381
00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:31.860
<v Speaker 2>usually owned by an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not always our family,</v>

1382
00:55:32.070 --> 00:55:33.000
<v Speaker 2>but then kind of store.</v>

1383
00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:36.000
<v Speaker 2>Those stores are almost not regulated at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

1384
00:55:36.001 --> 00:55:36.834
<v Speaker 2>I mean probably 90% of their products </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no FDA approval because of there's </v>

1385
00:55:41.221 --> 00:55:43.080
<v Speaker 2>no FDA approved for supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

1386
00:55:43.081 --> 00:55:46.260
<v Speaker 2>So there's just a stamp that says not </v>
<v Speaker 2>approved by FDA.</v>

1387
00:55:46.410 --> 00:55:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of their products are um,</v>

1388
00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:50.011
<v Speaker 2>most of their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1389
00:55:50.011 --> 00:55:50.611
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1390
00:55:50.611 --> 00:55:51.444
<v Speaker 2>their products are just out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where are all the deaths from health </v>

1391
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 2>food stores?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There aren't what health,</v>

1392
00:55:57.151 --> 00:56:00.450
<v Speaker 2>food stores have our standards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of standards,</v>

1393
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.313
<v Speaker 2>tons of standards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now some people buy certain products </v>

1394
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:04.374
<v Speaker 2>because they believe in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people buy certain bras because </v>

1395
00:56:05.551 --> 00:56:07.950
<v Speaker 2>they believe in the brand name up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1396
00:56:07.951 --> 00:56:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Some maybe go to certain stores that </v>
<v Speaker 2>trust those stores.</v>

1397
00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.760
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It happens all time.</v>

1398
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:13.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a standard.</v>

1399
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:14.603
<v Speaker 2>What would happen if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say there was a health food store or </v>

1400
00:56:16.111 --> 00:56:16.944
<v Speaker 2>even a GNC or any place like that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a supplement that if he took </v>

1401
00:56:20.371 --> 00:56:21.204
<v Speaker 2>that supplement and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people who took it will get </v>

1402
00:56:23.471 --> 00:56:24.790
<v Speaker 2>addicted and do crazy things.</v>

1403
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.530
<v Speaker 2>And that came out to the news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1404
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:29.350
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take xyz product,</v>

1405
00:56:29.620 --> 00:56:32.520
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably go crazy or do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so whatever happened,</v>

1406
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:33.870
<v Speaker 2>they removed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1407
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.150
<v Speaker 2>things like that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuel those away.</v>

1408
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly my point.</v>

1409
00:56:39.351 --> 00:56:40.810
<v Speaker 2>To kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1410
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:42.003
<v Speaker 2>It goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's actually repercussions and it </v>

1411
00:56:43.601 --> 00:56:45.190
<v Speaker 2>goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1412
00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.110
<v Speaker 2>and maybe there's a lawsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not,</v>

1413
00:56:47.111 --> 00:56:49.930
<v Speaker 2>but it goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if it's FDA approved?</v>

1414
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80% of all of our addicts,</v>

1415
00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:56.050
<v Speaker 2>FDA approved drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens.</v>

1416
00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:00.100
<v Speaker 2>When it's a government monopoly from by </v>
<v Speaker 2>a government regulatory body,</v>

1417
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 2>there's no repercussions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just keeps killing us.</v>

1418
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:04.263
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly still feel </v>

1419
00:57:04.530 --> 00:57:05.910
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1420
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:07.023
<v Speaker 2>Slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just keeps killing us on and on and </v>

1421
00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:12.070
<v Speaker 2>on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want things to be safe,</v>

1422
00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.880
<v Speaker 2>then let's focus on safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Focus on control,</v>

1423
00:57:16.810 --> 00:57:20.500
<v Speaker 2>so I want products to be safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not controlled.</v>

1424
00:57:20.830 --> 00:57:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Controlled is useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so make them safe.</v>

1425
00:57:23.181 --> 00:57:25.420
<v Speaker 2>They're safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll use a health food store examples,</v>

1426
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:27.190
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about competing standards?</v>

1427
00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:28.803
<v Speaker 2>Standards that are competing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with the </v>

1428
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:31.744
<v Speaker 2>government saying these are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>standards we believe have the </v>

1429
00:57:34.091 --> 00:57:36.310
<v Speaker 2>appropriate standards to be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should do that.</v>

1430
00:57:36.311 --> 00:57:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A practice is a choice.</v>

1431
00:57:38.290 --> 00:57:39.123
<v Speaker 2>Take the stamp or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the only exception is why they </v>

1432
00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:44.960
<v Speaker 2>punishing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you choose not to see what it does.</v>

1433
00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:48.070
<v Speaker 2>It's of innovation with government </v>
<v Speaker 2>stamps.</v>

1434
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:48.963
<v Speaker 2>Not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it has to be something that is </v>

1435
00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.170
<v Speaker 2>voluntary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's correct.</v>

1436
00:57:53.171 --> 00:57:55.330
<v Speaker 2>The person who owns the store and buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>the consumer.</v>

1437
00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:56.673
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do what my example I give is this </v>

1438
00:57:58.481 --> 00:57:59.950
<v Speaker 2>water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would probably has it.</v>

1439
00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:00.611
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

1440
00:58:00.611 --> 00:58:02.800
<v Speaker 2>It has that circle you the circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1441
00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:04.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what that means?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1442
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:06.400
<v Speaker 2>It's the Orthodox Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1443
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm live in New York.</v>

1444
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 2>City's a very high Jewish population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York City.</v>

1445
00:58:09.011 --> 00:58:09.844
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a Jewish friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Orthodox Union means it's a </v>

1446
00:58:11.441 --> 00:58:12.610
<v Speaker 2>kosher product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1447
00:58:12.611 --> 00:58:14.230
<v Speaker 2>so their water's kosher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This water's kosher?</v>

1448
00:58:14.231 --> 00:58:15.064
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does it become kosher to bless </v>

1449
00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:16.630
<v Speaker 2>blessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the issue.</v>

1450
00:58:16.631 --> 00:58:18.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the circle you on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1451
00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:19.563
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're Jewish and you care about </v>

1452
00:58:21.701 --> 00:58:22.534
<v Speaker 2>keeping a kosher household,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would buy this product because you </v>

1453
00:58:24.371 --> 00:58:25.330
<v Speaker 2>trust the circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

1454
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:27.290
<v Speaker 2>Is this kosher?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1455
00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:30.130
<v Speaker 2>But the person that buys it believes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and buys it.</v>

1456
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:30.993
<v Speaker 2>And what if they found out this was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water was not kosher then that'd be a </v>

1457
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:34.260
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be it.</v>

1458
00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Then there'd be some kind of backlash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1459
00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:37.893
<v Speaker 2>as a person who is a partner in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplement company and also someone who </v>

1460
00:58:41.921 --> 00:58:42.754
<v Speaker 2>works for the UFC who hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UFC has giant issues with people </v>

1461
00:58:46.511 --> 00:58:47.670
<v Speaker 2>taking tinted supplement.</v>

1462
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:48.503
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's third party independent </v>

1463
00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.530
<v Speaker 2>verification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>third independent testing.</v>

1464
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good supplement companies like on</v>

1465
00:58:56.081 --> 00:58:56.914
<v Speaker 2>it and many others use where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>find out that you don't have tainted </v>

1466
00:59:00.551 --> 00:59:01.810
<v Speaker 2>supplement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1467
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:04.600
<v Speaker 2>I'd rather have that than how about we </v>
<v Speaker 2>had those stamps on.</v>

1468
00:59:04.601 --> 00:59:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Products are like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1469
00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.293
<v Speaker 2>I had the stamps and if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>government that have that and guess </v>

1470
00:59:08.741 --> 00:59:10.240
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you want 4 cents,</v>

1471
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:11.103
<v Speaker 2>maybe want the government stamp plus </v>
<v Speaker 2>third party stamp plus authoritarian </v>

1472
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:14.263
<v Speaker 2>stamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well what I liked was the side business </v>

1473
00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.593
<v Speaker 2>does third party independent company </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely has their own personal </v>

1474
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 2>standards and you know when there</v>

1475
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 1>are really good company you can rely </v>
<v Speaker 1>upon them.</v>

1476
00:59:24.441 --> 00:59:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't,</v>

1477
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:29.060
<v Speaker 1>you could have competing standard </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple companies because you trust one</v>

1478
00:59:29.061 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 1>company more than the other or you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>both.</v>

1479
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible solution for education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a third party,</v>

1480
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:37.220
<v Speaker 1>independent verification of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>education system.</v>

1481
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:39.140
<v Speaker 1>We've been here for what about an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>or so?</v>

1482
00:59:39.141 --> 00:59:41.090
<v Speaker 1>And you already gave a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1483
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:42.080
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point.</v>

1484
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:44.480
<v Speaker 1>That seems like a good idea to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

1485
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:45.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be some effective school </v>

1486
00:59:48.111 --> 00:59:51.170
<v Speaker 1>system that works and then they take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that run that effective of school</v>

1487
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:52.004
<v Speaker 1>system and they have a curriculum and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way of doing things that they could </v>

1488
00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.330
<v Speaker 1>perhaps uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1489
00:59:56.331 --> 00:59:57.164
<v Speaker 1>teach other other school systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea of transparency and </v>

1490
00:59:59.511 --> 01:00:00.800
<v Speaker 1>accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point.</v>

1491
01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:03.350
<v Speaker 1>So this is the deal with people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarian,</v>

1492
01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:04.184
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that you are a free market </v>

1493
01:00:05.871 --> 01:00:06.704
<v Speaker 1>person and that you believe in the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>market and you believe in less </v>

1494
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

1495
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the consumer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1496
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Jennifer,</v>

1497
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:18.010
<v Speaker 1>the pool and things are consumer driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is not hundred percent role.</v>

1498
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Government isn't always wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often wrong.</v>

1499
01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>But not always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1500
01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>and the consumer isn't always right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but often,</v>

1501
01:00:24.171 --> 01:00:26.030
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a general role,</v>

1502
01:00:26.031 --> 01:00:29.390
<v Speaker 1>consumers tend to drive things better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as I said,</v>

1503
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:30.224
<v Speaker 1>kosher water like supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't allow the consumer to </v>

1504
01:00:33.041 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you by default stifle innovation,</v>

1505
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:36.733
<v Speaker 1>you just stifle innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stifle everything new because if it </v>

1506
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:42.920
<v Speaker 1>can't get through the FDA that it can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost can't be done.</v>

1507
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>And you have centralized control that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to get past.</v>

1508
01:00:46.311 --> 01:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>You got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

1509
01:00:47.751 --> 01:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Or not really motivated to improve or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>no end to the opposite.</v>

1510
01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:52.053
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually incentivized to make </v>

1511
01:00:53.151 --> 01:00:56.810
<v Speaker 1>sure nothing goes wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So always err on the side of no,</v>

1512
01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1513
01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>It becomes the rule of no one meaning </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is about,</v>

1514
01:01:00.621 --> 01:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no one's job to make it work.</v>

1515
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>This is my point on the education </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1516
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.470
<v Speaker 1>The job there has to be someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who says,</v>

1517
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:12.650
<v Speaker 1>we have to make this thing work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy who says that I want to make</v>

1518
01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>it work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make this thing work.</v>

1519
01:01:14.991 --> 01:01:15.824
<v Speaker 1>Let's just not make sure things go bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make sure that things actually </v>

1520
01:01:19.251 --> 01:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1521
01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:24.020
<v Speaker 1>you obviously know far more about New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York politics than I do.</v>

1522
01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:24.854
<v Speaker 1>I know very little about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing that I do know is it's </v>

1523
01:01:26.781 --> 01:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>almost universally regarded as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely corrupt.</v>

1524
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:30.493
<v Speaker 1>True.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get to a position where you become </v>

1525
01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1526
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:35.740
<v Speaker 1>How do you clean up that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>hornets?</v>

1527
01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing people always say is,</v>

1528
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Lara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to clean it up.</v>

1529
01:01:39.771 --> 01:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Like you just said.</v>

1530
01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It's funny you use that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I hear all the time.</v>

1531
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.660
<v Speaker 1>You got to get these guys in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to punish them.</v>

1532
01:01:44.661 --> 01:01:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Whatever I ran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about that and the reason is,</v>

1533
01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put some guy in jail,</v>

1534
01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you punish him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the case may be.</v>

1535
01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:52.844
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's family came back from North </v>

1536
01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Carolina?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's kick I that education?</v>

1537
01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Who got a better job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whose taxes went down?</v>

1538
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>Who's happier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose business didn't go under?</v>

1539
01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:02.653
<v Speaker 1>No one's helped by people going to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We feel righteous and then we pack up </v>

1540
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:07.550
<v Speaker 1>and move to North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1541
01:02:07.551 --> 01:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>this is not the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Carolina is beautiful.</v>

1542
01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:13.160
<v Speaker 1>It is and that's another problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

1543
01:02:13.161 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>You go there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all green and it is people,</v>

1544
01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>it's grave or not to have it a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>Twang to the way they talk.</v>

1545
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:18.783
<v Speaker 1>Barb can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty fucking good to try to make </v>

1546
01:02:19.801 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>sure</v>

1547
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.450
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of New Yorkers don't go there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and ruin it.</v>

1548
01:02:21.451 --> 01:02:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Say I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand.</v>

1549
01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 2>That's keeping New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping New York.</v>

1550
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to keep them all in New York.</v>

1551
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.190
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my point being,</v>

1552
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgot my point now.</v>

1553
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:33.541
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1554
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:36.890
<v Speaker 2>Your point by point of corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of the jail,</v>

1555
01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:38.880
<v Speaker 2>the goal is not to just put people in </v>
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>

1556
01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:40.140
<v Speaker 2>The goals make a better system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1557
01:02:40.170 --> 01:02:41.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really even interested in </v>

1558
01:02:41.461 --> 01:02:43.980
<v Speaker 2>putting them in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm interested in is figuring out a</v>

1559
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:46.050
<v Speaker 2>way to stop corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Several things.</v>

1560
01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.360
<v Speaker 2>The first thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of you can't stop corruption.</v>

1561
01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:52.530
<v Speaker 2>You can absolutely lessen it and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>catch it fast that you can do,</v>

1562
01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:54.510
<v Speaker 2>you can make less corruption and catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>it fast.</v>

1563
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Then you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the average person who is about to do</v>

1564
01:02:58.081 --> 01:03:00.630
<v Speaker 2>something which may or may not be </v>
<v Speaker 2>unethical or maybe corrupt?</v>

1565
01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:01.663
<v Speaker 2>Is it thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if I'll get five years or 10 </v>

1566
01:03:03.901 --> 01:03:05.220
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just thinking,</v>

1567
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:06.263
<v Speaker 2>will I get caught?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the thinking about will I get </v>

1568
01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 2>caught and will my be over?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1569
01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:10.763
<v Speaker 2>So several things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one I went less opportunity for </v>

1570
01:03:12.781 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 2>someone to be caught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean in New York state?</v>

1571
01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Less money coming from Albany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is our capital less money.</v>

1572
01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.670
<v Speaker 2>The less money the governor has to give </v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

1573
01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.650
<v Speaker 2>the less chance that there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>

1574
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.420
<v Speaker 2>That's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on top of that,</v>

1575
01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:25.403
<v Speaker 2>New York state is filled with boards and</v>
<v Speaker 2>committees and authorities and things </v>

1576
01:03:30.211 --> 01:03:32.820
<v Speaker 2>that the governor creates to make other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things happen.</v>

1577
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.073
<v Speaker 2>We'll create this authority to make this</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen and this commission to make that </v>

1578
01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:38.160
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he appoints all of his cronies,</v>

1579
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:39.023
<v Speaker 2>all of his buddies onto these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto these commissions and boards and </v>

1580
01:03:41.491 --> 01:03:43.710
<v Speaker 2>such.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he now has one step away,</v>

1581
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:48.630
<v Speaker 2>but he is raised over $800,000 for his </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign for people he's put on boards.</v>

1582
01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:50.280
<v Speaker 2>So he gets lots of money for these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1583
01:03:50.310 --> 01:03:51.690
<v Speaker 2>rewards them up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting on boards,</v>

1584
01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:54.780
<v Speaker 2>and then they become corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you've noticed that your politics,</v>

1585
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 2>many people have been indicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrested,</v>

1586
01:03:56.791 --> 01:03:57.624
<v Speaker 2>convicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every one of them is either on a </v>

1587
01:03:59.581 --> 01:04:04.581
<v Speaker 2>board or a commission or authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trashing those is a huge part of getting</v>

1588
01:04:04.761 --> 01:04:05.594
<v Speaker 2>a corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Getting me what we have in New York </v>

1589
01:04:06.631 --> 01:04:07.464
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have regional economic development </v>

1590
01:04:08.401 --> 01:04:09.234
<v Speaker 2>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are basically with the government </v>

1591
01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:13.380
<v Speaker 2>decides where the money goes to develop </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>

1592
01:04:13.590 --> 01:04:14.423
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government decides where to develop </v>

1593
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:18.760
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean any gap jump?</v>

1594
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1595
01:04:19.650 --> 01:04:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put money into whether it</v>

1596
01:04:21.601 --> 01:04:24.060
<v Speaker 2>can be infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>building a hospital,</v>

1597
01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.570
<v Speaker 2>putting a new downtown in all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>types of things,</v>

1598
01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.880
<v Speaker 2>so who would then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about the local,</v>

1599
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:31.980
<v Speaker 2>the local people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local government.</v>

1600
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:33.330
<v Speaker 2>The mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1601
01:04:33.331 --> 01:04:34.164
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1602
01:04:34.890 --> 01:04:37.170
<v Speaker 2>Need the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a be the local,</v>

1603
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:39.600
<v Speaker 2>local and local less as something else.</v>

1604
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.870
<v Speaker 2>How about just like bankers who want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>invest in things,</v>

1605
01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:45.510
<v Speaker 2>businessmen who think this is a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

1606
01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:49.320
<v Speaker 2>How about the local woman who thinks </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a great place for it opened up a</v>

1607
01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:52.020
<v Speaker 2>whole new business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about the guy or Gal who thinks this</v>

1608
01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:54.420
<v Speaker 2>is a great place for a new school as </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to what it is now,</v>

1609
01:04:54.421 --> 01:04:56.910
<v Speaker 2>which is we all that petition to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

1610
01:04:56.911 --> 01:04:58.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think we should.</v>

1611
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:59.783
<v Speaker 2>The government then agrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blesses it gives us a certificate of </v>

1612
01:05:01.561 --> 01:05:04.140
<v Speaker 2>need and then says here's the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>money to build this thing.</v>

1613
01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:07.110
<v Speaker 2>That is completely the wrong answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1614
01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.180
<v Speaker 2>But then it's going to be some </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulation.</v>

1615
01:05:09.181 --> 01:05:13.020
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't really want a nightclub </v>
<v Speaker 2>opening up right next to us and we go,</v>

1616
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:14.940
<v Speaker 2>there's gotta be some regulations gene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy's,</v>

1617
01:05:14.941 --> 01:05:15.820
<v Speaker 2>there should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1618
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:16.950
<v Speaker 2>of course I did that.</v>

1619
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:18.640
<v Speaker 2>At what point did I say destroy </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything?</v>

1620
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:21.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you have ever said that,</v>

1621
01:05:21.790 --> 01:05:25.590
<v Speaker 2>but I'm asking you if there should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>some regulation based assays.</v>

1622
01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:29.680
<v Speaker 2>If I'm arguing to control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not I based upon safety,</v>

1623
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.520
<v Speaker 2>not control safety.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it is based upon safety,</v>

1624
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1625
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.700
<v Speaker 2>Like a scroll would be right next to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>strip club.</v>

1626
01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Is that safety right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

1627
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think so.</v>

1628
01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.350
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm okay with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that's true.</v>

1629
01:05:41.351 --> 01:05:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know enough about that,</v>

1630
01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 2>but if that safety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay.</v>

1631
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:45.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not safe for those kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there we go.</v>

1632
01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Some of those girls then that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I'm fine with that and have,</v>

1633
01:05:48.851 --> 01:05:50.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem if it's based </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon safety,</v>

1634
01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:51.893
<v Speaker 2>but just because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because I decide I don't like this </v>

1635
01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:56.230
<v Speaker 2>thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1636
01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:58.023
<v Speaker 2>If someone was stability or the ability </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if the community doesn't want it </v>

1637
01:06:00.131 --> 01:06:02.590
<v Speaker 2>there as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the community doesn't support it.</v>

1638
01:06:02.650 --> 01:06:03.483
<v Speaker 2>What's the main argument against </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarian philosophy when you fear </v>

1639
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:08.140
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fear.</v>

1640
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Fear of change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fear.</v>

1641
01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Fear of not having big brother and </v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

1642
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Remember something in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean New York.</v>

1643
01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:17.140
<v Speaker 2>In America in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a general rule in America,</v>

1644
01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.290
<v Speaker 2>the government does not just take our </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights as a general rule,</v>

1645
01:06:20.291 --> 01:06:22.720
<v Speaker 2>we eagerly vote them away because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>afraid.</v>

1646
01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid take my rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid.</v>

1647
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Take my rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what usually happens.</v>

1648
01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 2>Fears of problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why as you've said will,</v>

1649
01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:31.834
<v Speaker 2>there'll be no regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of libertarians who </v>

1650
01:06:33.581 --> 01:06:34.540
<v Speaker 2>probably heard that and went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1651
01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Larry say no regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to,</v>

1652
01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:37.683
<v Speaker 2>and here's the reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I decided to pull the rug out from </v>

1653
01:06:39.881 --> 01:06:41.410
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will be afraid.</v>

1654
01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:45.160
<v Speaker 2>People who are afraid make bad decisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

1655
01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:48.070
<v Speaker 2>The word that I'd use more here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe it's not landing,</v>

1656
01:06:48.071 --> 01:06:50.020
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is my error for not making </v>
<v Speaker 2>this land better,</v>

1657
01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:51.093
<v Speaker 2>is facilitate.</v>

1658
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I want to facilitate better options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would facilitate better answers.</v>

1659
01:06:56.050 --> 01:06:58.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm not just going to go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some may say take away the money,</v>

1660
01:06:58.841 --> 01:06:59.674
<v Speaker 2>go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would create fear and bad </v>

1661
01:07:01.961 --> 01:07:03.730
<v Speaker 2>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would you do instead?</v>

1662
01:07:03.731 --> 01:07:04.564
<v Speaker 2>I would say in x number of months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the federal government regulations and </v>

1663
01:07:08.711 --> 01:07:11.140
<v Speaker 2>the federal government dollars are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go away,</v>

1664
01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.190
<v Speaker 2>which means by this time we're not going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have it,</v>

1665
01:07:13.210 --> 01:07:14.770
<v Speaker 2>which means that only do you not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the money,</v>

1666
01:07:14.771 --> 01:07:16.930
<v Speaker 2>but also you don't have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictions.</v>

1667
01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.333
<v Speaker 2>How can we fix this system to win so you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have district restrictions </v>

1668
01:07:20.951 --> 01:07:23.260
<v Speaker 2>anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can you make to be better,</v>

1669
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.280
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster?</v>

1670
01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:26.440
<v Speaker 2>How can we do this now let's talk this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing out.</v>

1671
01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:27.483
<v Speaker 2>Some people will fight me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course some people will not make a </v>

1672
01:07:29.261 --> 01:07:31.390
<v Speaker 2>change of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some will go,</v>

1673
01:07:31.391 --> 01:07:32.770
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank you so much.</v>

1674
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:33.603
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would much rather not spend the money </v>

1675
01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:36.310
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd rather spend it here.</v>

1676
01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:37.151
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's try that.</v>

1677
01:07:37.151 --> 01:07:37.984
<v Speaker 2>Let's do that and before the others will</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow and then others will follow and </v>

1678
01:07:40.661 --> 01:07:43.030
<v Speaker 2>that might take a year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might take three years.</v>

1679
01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:44.313
<v Speaker 2>But what will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a much better effective </v>

1680
01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:50.040
<v Speaker 2>system and when one fails,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hopefully,</v>

1681
01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.660
<v Speaker 2>hopefully none yet because it hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been done before.</v>

1682
01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been done in everything.</v>

1683
01:07:54.431 --> 01:07:56.800
<v Speaker 2>We'll give you the best example I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>give you with education with,</v>

1684
01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.300
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the best of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give you.</v>

1685
01:07:58.330 --> 01:07:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1686
01:07:59.770 --> 01:08:01.360
<v Speaker 2>google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>google,</v>

1687
01:08:01.361 --> 01:08:01.930
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1688
01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:04.870
<v Speaker 2>Google had a program and I think they </v>
<v Speaker 2>still have it.</v>

1689
01:08:04.871 --> 01:08:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure someone will let me know if </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>

1690
01:08:06.311 --> 01:08:08.700
<v Speaker 2>but I believe they do to where you had </v>
<v Speaker 2>an um,</v>

1691
01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.740
<v Speaker 2>an employee could choose to take 20% of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

1692
01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:15.380
<v Speaker 2>their work time and do it on any project</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to,</v>

1693
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:17.600
<v Speaker 1>any project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they want to do.</v>

1694
01:08:17.601 --> 01:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Did you work on if they want to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was voluntary.</v>

1695
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:20.900
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have to just do your regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>workload if you want it to,</v>

1696
01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:23.480
<v Speaker 1>but if you wanted to be like 20% and </v>
<v Speaker 1>work on anything you want,</v>

1697
01:08:23.481 --> 01:08:24.314
<v Speaker 1>whatever you think is appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only rule was you have to be </v>

1698
01:08:26.451 --> 01:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>transparent and you're accountable to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your team what you did.</v>

1699
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in uh,</v>

1700
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:32.390
<v Speaker 1>freedom plus transparency plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>callability.</v>

1701
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:32.991
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1702
01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:33.824
<v Speaker 1>And was that many of the people did </v>
<v Speaker 1>things mindup up doing things that </v>

1703
01:08:36.231 --> 01:08:37.850
<v Speaker 1>didn't really work very well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they did it,</v>

1704
01:08:37.851 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey joe,</v>

1705
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I went and tried this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't work.</v>

1706
01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>You might have tried it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn something,</v>

1707
01:08:42.861 --> 01:08:44.060
<v Speaker 1>figured things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made it better.</v>

1708
01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:47.060
<v Speaker 1>But a bunch of their most profitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1709
01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:50.510
<v Speaker 1>profitable applications came from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what I actually want,</v>

1710
01:08:50.511 --> 01:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm happening also is some people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>20% some people weren't even more,</v>

1711
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:55.730
<v Speaker 1>let's get more work out of some people.</v>

1712
01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:56.563
<v Speaker 1>They have more innovation out of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were doing stuff they </v>

1713
01:08:58.111 --> 01:09:00.470
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now does everyone take it?</v>

1714
01:09:00.471 --> 01:09:01.304
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people just did their own work and </v>

1715
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:03.920
<v Speaker 1>we're happy with her work at their </v>
<v Speaker 1>salary moved on,</v>

1716
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.473
<v Speaker 1>but what happened is you got innovation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other people learn from it and it </v>

1717
01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:11.030
<v Speaker 1>became better and better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happens all the time.</v>

1718
01:09:11.310 --> 01:09:12.143
<v Speaker 1>All the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a very different system than </v>

1719
01:09:14.601 --> 01:09:17.630
<v Speaker 1>talking about the education system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're talking about Google,</v>

1720
01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:18.464
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>hired to make money for a mega </v>

1721
01:09:20.961 --> 01:09:21.794
<v Speaker 1>corporation that makes billions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars and you give them a </v>

1722
01:09:25.041 --> 01:09:27.170
<v Speaker 1>chance because they're engineers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>techies,</v>

1723
01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:30.020
<v Speaker 1>you give them a chance to innovate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They innovate,</v>

1724
01:09:30.021 --> 01:09:33.320
<v Speaker 1>but their financial incentive is </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive.</v>

1725
01:09:33.410 --> 01:09:34.243
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have differential instead of hasn't </v>

1726
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.400
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who's a big executive at Google?</v>

1727
01:09:37.610 --> 01:09:39.240
<v Speaker 1>They make a shitload of money.</v>

1728
01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:40.073
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people that work underneath them </v>

1729
01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:42.884
<v Speaker 1>have the potential to move up that </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate ladder to show none of this </v>

1730
01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:46.610
<v Speaker 1>financial incentive in the school </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

1731
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:49.490
<v Speaker 1>That's not only that you're limiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>their amount of money.</v>

1732
01:09:49.491 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not just offering them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility to exchange creative ideas.</v>

1733
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:54.974
<v Speaker 1>You're saying we're going to give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>less money and we're going to have the </v>

1734
01:09:57.321 --> 01:10:00.290
<v Speaker 1>administrators who are still going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a position of power.</v>

1735
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:01.333
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to have to figure this </v>

1736
01:10:02.721 --> 01:10:03.790
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

1737
01:10:03.791 --> 01:10:05.840
<v Speaker 1>This is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a parallel situation.</v>

1738
01:10:05.841 --> 01:10:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you why.</v>

1739
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.863
<v Speaker 1>Parallel situation a wide is the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is the people who get into </v>

1740
01:10:10.401 --> 01:10:13.130
<v Speaker 1>teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get in because my God,</v>

1741
01:10:13.131 --> 01:10:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I'll make millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't do that.</v>

1742
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.460
<v Speaker 1>They get into it because they think it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a viable career path for them.</v>

1743
01:10:19.461 --> 01:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>They have skill at it.</v>

1744
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.910
<v Speaker 1>They enjoyed doing it and they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a difference.</v>

1745
01:10:22.950 --> 01:10:24.200
<v Speaker 1>All those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1746
01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:25.760
<v Speaker 1>that's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're lucky,</v>

1747
01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:26.630
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1748
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:28.460
<v Speaker 1>if everyone's lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they do it for.</v>

1749
01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing with Google,</v>

1750
01:10:30.201 --> 01:10:31.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does everyone go there?</v>

1751
01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm gonna make tons of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1752
01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.073
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them didn't show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of teachers go there because </v>

1753
01:10:34.341 --> 01:10:35.450
<v Speaker 1>they don't make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1754
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:36.463
<v Speaker 1>So the incentive you women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody's going to google </v>

1755
01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>because they want to make a difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>in how teachers,</v>

1756
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:41.390
<v Speaker 1>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1757
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:43.660
<v Speaker 1>while there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow they're parallel.</v>

1758
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Something you want to go to muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant business.</v>

1759
01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many?</v>

1760
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:48.103
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest businesses in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and the New York City in New York </v>

1761
01:10:50.391 --> 01:10:51.224
<v Speaker 1>state schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system and say 60 billion odd </v>

1762
01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:55.520
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still a bunch of money.</v>

1763
01:10:55.521 --> 01:10:58.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing.</v>

1764
01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.493
<v Speaker 1>The same thing by any stretch of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagination and it's certainly not </v>

1765
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:02.324
<v Speaker 1>profitable for the individuals that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in this innovation that you </v>

1766
01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:07.610
<v Speaker 1>seek and I think you are wrong in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1767
01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 1>How am I wrong that it's not profitable </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the individuals that you're asking?</v>

1768
01:11:12.021 --> 01:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>You are assuming because we lose $4 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>

1769
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:18.870
<v Speaker 1>You're assumption is that means teachers</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get more money.</v>

1770
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 1>That's your assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was going to get more money.</v>

1771
01:11:21.571 --> 01:11:24.780
<v Speaker 1>If you're giving them less money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not keeping teachers less money.</v>

1772
01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:26.410
<v Speaker 1>You're giving the school last month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's correct.</v>

1773
01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:29.060
<v Speaker 1>School district class money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teacher's not going to get less money.</v>

1774
01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Schools get more less money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1775
01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:32.370
<v Speaker 1>what if you got rid of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1776
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.890
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of administrators?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if you got rid of,</v>

1777
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:35.743
<v Speaker 1>you would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would decide that these </v>

1778
01:11:37.231 --> 01:11:38.064
<v Speaker 1>administrators are removed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't know how many times I've got to </v>

1779
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.000
<v Speaker 1>say this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never said anything clear.</v>

1780
01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:43.560
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm asking you over and over </v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

1781
01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.390
<v Speaker 1>This is not clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

1782
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.160
<v Speaker 1>You're saying it's going to work itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1783
01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to facilitate it,</v>

1784
01:11:49.021 --> 01:11:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but then you comparing this to google </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're giving people who are making</v>

1785
01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:53.820
<v Speaker 1>a fantastic salary.</v>

1786
01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability to innovate for 20% of their</v>

1787
01:11:55.951 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1788
01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:57.713
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think these are valid </v>

1789
01:11:58.681 --> 01:12:01.050
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans are humans.</v>

1790
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:02.423
<v Speaker 1>We want to have purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to do better at whatever we're </v>

1791
01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:06.744
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want tap accolades from those who </v>

1792
01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:10.320
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what humans want.</v>

1793
01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.213
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1794
01:12:11.370 --> 01:12:13.830
<v Speaker 1>No matter what humans want that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a teacher,</v>

1795
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.260
<v Speaker 1>you want accolades from those you </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

1796
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.213
<v Speaker 1>You want to be good at what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also want to be able to feed your </v>

1797
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:20.094
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also want to be able to make a </v>

1798
01:12:20.881 --> 01:12:24.120
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in most of them make piss poor money.</v>

1799
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:25.680
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an Oklahoma,</v>

1800
01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:27.420
<v Speaker 1>it's New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1801
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:32.220
<v Speaker 1>So most of them are doing well enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>not starve it down.</v>

1802
01:12:32.221 --> 01:12:34.390
<v Speaker 1>How much did I make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much show how my teacher makes it?</v>

1803
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:37.800
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you just get done saying how </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive it is to live in New York?</v>

1804
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:39.720
<v Speaker 1>It is expense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taxes are outrageous.</v>

1805
01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.310
<v Speaker 1>It's outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1806
01:12:41.311 --> 01:12:42.780
<v Speaker 1>We're moving out in droves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>

1807
01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:43.883
<v Speaker 1>And then there's going to be less money </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people that already get paid less </v>

1808
01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:49.890
<v Speaker 1>than they should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That not saying that's true.</v>

1809
01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:50.993
<v Speaker 1>Your saying that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be less money that </v>

1810
01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:53.850
<v Speaker 1>goes to the school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to a school district.</v>

1811
01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:54.684
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how was that not going to translate </v>

1812
01:12:57.481 --> 01:12:59.550
<v Speaker 1>into less money that goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers and less.</v>

1813
01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I will try it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

1814
01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:01.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1815
01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:02.550
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've never said it.</v>

1816
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:03.563
<v Speaker 1>Tell me what he wanted me to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one has decided how this is going to </v>

1817
01:13:06.721 --> 01:13:08.250
<v Speaker 1>somehow know the benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teachers,</v>

1818
01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:08.960
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've,</v>

1819
01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:11.340
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've not firing these administrators.</v>

1820
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:13.380
<v Speaker 1>You're making everybody figured out on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>

1821
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:16.020
<v Speaker 1>The administrators will wind up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired.</v>

1822
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:18.270
<v Speaker 1>They will by WHO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by what?</v>

1823
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:19.960
<v Speaker 1>The PTA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm some PDA.</v>

1824
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:22.050
<v Speaker 1>The at the school boards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will begin to it.</v>

1825
01:13:22.051 --> 01:13:22.884
<v Speaker 1>You're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen.</v>

1826
01:13:23.010 --> 01:13:24.720
<v Speaker 1>We're going to facilitate the way out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

1827
01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

1828
01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:27.083
<v Speaker 1>if you want me to say there are 700 </v>
<v Speaker 1>school districts and I'm going to fire </v>

1829
01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:32.130
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

1830
01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:33.150
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>

1831
01:13:33.151 --> 01:13:33.984
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm literally two months out from </v>

1832
01:13:36.690 --> 01:13:39.600
<v Speaker 1>the election and then at least nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>months middle mentoring it.</v>

1833
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:42.330
<v Speaker 1>You're simply asking too much of me just</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking too much of me.</v>

1834
01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.690
<v Speaker 1>The skeleton is built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is good.</v>

1835
01:13:45.870 --> 01:13:48.270
<v Speaker 1>It will work when we fill out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we will.</v>

1836
01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How am I going to which guide a fire and</v>

1837
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm a year out from doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically asking much of me.</v>

1838
01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.170
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an unfair question.</v>

1839
01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:56.483
<v Speaker 1>It's an unfair question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not asking you which particular </v>

1840
01:13:58.291 --> 01:13:59.124
<v Speaker 1>human being defier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking you how you're going to </v>

1841
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:02.274
<v Speaker 1>facilitate paying less money to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>school districts and somehow or another </v>

1842
01:14:07.050 --> 01:14:07.883
<v Speaker 1>having them organize the right way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the school runs smoother and more </v>

1843
01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 1>efficiently while you're comparing it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who work at a multibillion dollar</v>

1844
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:17.884
<v Speaker 1>tech company where you're allowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers who get paid substantial </v>

1845
01:14:21.701 --> 01:14:24.340
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money to innovate for 20% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their time.</v>

1846
01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:25.173
<v Speaker 1>And I was saying that these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a valid comparison and I'm </v>

1847
01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:27.904
<v Speaker 1>saying you're incorrect cause they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both human humans want to be good at </v>

1848
01:14:32.261 --> 01:14:34.540
<v Speaker 1>what they want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality of it is,</v>

1849
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:35.613
<v Speaker 1>as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of school districts won't do much </v>

1850
01:14:37.691 --> 01:14:38.524
<v Speaker 1>different at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there will always be early adopters </v>

1851
01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:41.074
<v Speaker 1>that happens in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will always be early adopters and </v>

1852
01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:46.780
<v Speaker 1>some people will jump in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a wonderful idea.</v>

1853
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's start working on this now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some will,</v>

1854
01:14:49.450 --> 01:14:50.283
<v Speaker 1>some sort just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do absolute nothing and they will </v>

1855
01:14:51.071 --> 01:14:53.560
<v Speaker 1>think Larry was going to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

1856
01:14:53.561 --> 01:14:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Let's change nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1857
01:14:55.540 --> 01:14:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And probably most will do absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing once I'm elected.</v>

1858
01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but a bunch of going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

1859
01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:02.134
<v Speaker 1>what an awesome thing this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'll begin making changes right </v>

1860
01:15:03.821 --> 01:15:06.190
<v Speaker 1>away and as they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll start watching,</v>

1861
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:06.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you,</v>

1862
01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:07.773
<v Speaker 1>what are you proposing?</v>

1863
01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:09.700
<v Speaker 1>What's the right way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds great.</v>

1864
01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:11.860
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

1865
01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.180
<v Speaker 1>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my business guy,</v>

1866
01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1867
01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been an officer in a public company</v>

1868
01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:17.134
<v Speaker 1>for short periods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm twice and in both cases when I went </v>

1869
01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:19.780
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go and going,</v>

1870
01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.040
<v Speaker 1>ew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ew,</v>

1871
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:22.030
<v Speaker 1>ew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ew.</v>

1872
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.490
<v Speaker 1>That's TV show stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not how it works.</v>

1873
01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.040
<v Speaker 1>How it works is you walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talk to people,</v>

1874
01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:30.100
<v Speaker 1>you begin to figure out what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try new things until the right thing</v>

1875
01:15:30.101 --> 01:15:32.380
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you fix a business.</v>

1876
01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.990
<v Speaker 1>And if you know anyone who does it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you that's how you do it.</v>

1877
01:15:34.991 --> 01:15:36.340
<v Speaker 1>You don't walk and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know everything.</v>

1878
01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:37.600
<v Speaker 1>So it works well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

1879
01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:40.300
<v Speaker 1>let me come at you from a position of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear.</v>

1880
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:41.223
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend that I'm a parent and I'm </v>

1881
01:15:42.731 --> 01:15:46.870
<v Speaker 1>hearing this plan and I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a plan.</v>

1882
01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:47.733
<v Speaker 1>You're eliminating money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if my school system doesn't figure </v>

1883
01:15:51.371 --> 01:15:53.710
<v Speaker 1>out a way to innovate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would if they cut funding,</v>

1884
01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:58.711
<v Speaker 1>would have the kids classes get bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if there's just a just a mass panic</v>

1885
01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:02.470
<v Speaker 1>throughout the organization because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially gutted their infrastructure.</v>

1886
01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gutted their infrastructure.</v>

1887
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I really hope they don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they might your right.</v>

1888
01:16:07.170 --> 01:16:10.810
<v Speaker 1>That would be if I was your opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely what I would argue.</v>

1889
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:11.703
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess you could argue that if you </v>

1890
01:16:12.491 --> 01:16:14.170
<v Speaker 1>wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my response.</v>

1891
01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep the same system,</v>

1892
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:22.450
<v Speaker 1>keep paying your same taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your kids unhappy,</v>

1893
01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:23.523
<v Speaker 1>sue the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can pack up and move to South </v>

1894
01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:28.003
<v Speaker 1>Carolina this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it North Carolina or Tennessee </v>

1895
01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.120
<v Speaker 1>instead of North Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

1896
01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Cause your hat going move if you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1897
01:16:33.371 --> 01:16:35.710
<v Speaker 1>That is an option for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was your opponent,</v>

1898
01:16:35.740 --> 01:16:38.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say that is a ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition.</v>

1899
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:43.470
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying either we keep the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current system or we adopt your system.</v>

1900
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:45.303
<v Speaker 1>These are the only two options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We either leave or we take your option </v>

1901
01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:51.850
<v Speaker 1>and Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're would say,</v>

1902
01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:55.300
<v Speaker 1>why don't you throw more money at these </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers?</v>

1903
01:16:55.301 --> 01:16:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Give them more incentive to succeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to take money away from</v>

1904
01:16:59.951 --> 01:17:00.784
<v Speaker 1>something else and apply it to education</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we believe that it is the least </v>

1905
01:17:04.361 --> 01:17:05.194
<v Speaker 1>appreciated thing that is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important because we've been doing that </v>

1906
01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 1>for 20 years and failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>

1907
01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been paying teachers more.</v>

1908
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.943
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had been throwing more money at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system with for 20 years to hiring </v>

1909
01:17:16.611 --> 01:17:18.620
<v Speaker 1>administrators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been throwing my,</v>

1910
01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:20.750
<v Speaker 1>we've been doing it for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't worked yet.</v>

1911
01:17:20.751 --> 01:17:22.610
<v Speaker 1>When are you gonna stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my response.</v>

1912
01:17:22.850 --> 01:17:25.850
<v Speaker 1>We've been doing it for 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least throwing.</v>

1913
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:26.743
<v Speaker 1>We spend more money per kid than </v>
<v Speaker 1>California does and we have worse </v>

1914
01:17:31.311 --> 01:17:32.144
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

1915
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:36.650
<v Speaker 1>If you're happy with that system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome Volk Cuomo,</v>

1916
01:17:36.710 --> 01:17:38.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll keep it,</v>

1917
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:41.720
<v Speaker 1>no worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you actually want change,</v>

1918
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.390
<v Speaker 1>if you're unhappy with the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to change it.</v>

1919
01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>And they said to my system with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>

1920
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.530
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same thing.</v>

1921
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:49.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I haven't even prepared and I'm </v>

1922
01:17:50.481 --> 01:17:52.190
<v Speaker 1>finding all these problems with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he ever,</v>

1923
01:17:52.191 --> 01:17:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you haven't given me one prom at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't given you any problem.</v>

1924
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:56.870
<v Speaker 1>What have you heard me say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not One you just said,</v>

1925
01:17:56.871 --> 01:17:57.441
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>

1926
01:17:57.441 --> 01:17:58.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not what I said.</v>

1927
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's I haven't said it.</v>

1928
01:18:00.981 --> 01:18:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never said that once.</v>

1929
01:18:03.230 --> 01:18:05.360
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if but what if but what if,</v>

1930
01:18:05.361 --> 01:18:08.300
<v Speaker 1>but one last what if questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not saying I would says I'm afraid.</v>

1931
01:18:08.301 --> 01:18:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>

1932
01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I hear.</v>

1933
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:15.370
<v Speaker 1>But what if is asking you to define how </v>
<v Speaker 1>your system is going to succeed?</v>

1934
01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not saying I'm afraid that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperbole.</v>

1935
01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Didn't you just say if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if maybe I'm,</v>

1936
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:25.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe I didn't hear you correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you just say,</v>

1937
01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:29.130
<v Speaker 1>but what if this bad thing happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if it's my school district went,</v>

1938
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:34.390
<v Speaker 1>what I did is I had an exercise where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've made a parent who was scared.</v>

1939
01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.290
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>

1940
01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And I'm telling you as a person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not debating you,</v>

1941
01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm just asking you questions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1942
01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious,</v>

1943
01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:44.463
<v Speaker 1>but I see massive flaws in the logic </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind allowing these systems to figure </v>

1944
01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:53.150
<v Speaker 1>out how to eliminate administrators in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to stay alive with less money.</v>

1945
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:57.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll try it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm facilitating this to make it happen.</v>

1946
01:18:57.980 --> 01:19:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to oversee it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1947
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.943
<v Speaker 1>There's already administrators in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in at Albany who can help to facilitate </v>

1948
01:19:03.951 --> 01:19:04.310
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>

1949
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:07.700
<v Speaker 1>I understand what you've said and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can repeat it at nauseum.</v>

1950
01:19:07.701 --> 01:19:08.534
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems very loosely defined and </v>

1951
01:19:11.541 --> 01:19:13.100
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would agree with you.</v>

1952
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's confusing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loosely defined is true.</v>

1953
01:19:15.891 --> 01:19:17.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a skeleton and it's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeleton.</v>

1954
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's confusing in the fact that you have</v>

1955
01:19:19.701 --> 01:19:23.000
<v Speaker 1>these administrators and they're in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>position where you're going to eliminate</v>

1956
01:19:23.001 --> 01:19:25.970
<v Speaker 1>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know how many or which way</v>

1957
01:19:26.150 --> 01:19:26.983
<v Speaker 1>or how to do that and you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow the PTA and the teacher's unions </v>

1958
01:19:29.961 --> 01:19:32.180
<v Speaker 1>to figure this out or not the teachers </v>
<v Speaker 1>union,</v>

1959
01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:33.860
<v Speaker 1>but whoever would be just to be part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it too.</v>

1960
01:19:33.861 --> 01:19:34.371
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1961
01:19:34.371 --> 01:19:36.380
<v Speaker 1>you used to be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>PTSB part of it.</v>

1962
01:19:36.381 --> 01:19:37.214
<v Speaker 1>School boards be part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course Albany's administrators to be </v>

1963
01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:42.230
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it you can't,</v>

1964
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:43.183
<v Speaker 1>you can't do a long term solution for </v>
<v Speaker 1>any problem by just dictating what is </v>

1965
01:19:47.931 --> 01:19:48.764
<v Speaker 1>right and what is wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you more worried about the </v>

1966
01:19:50.871 --> 01:19:51.704
<v Speaker 1>short term consequences are the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going to vote for you or not </v>

1967
01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:56.030
<v Speaker 1>vote for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not though.</v>

1968
01:19:56.031 --> 01:19:57.680
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My assumption is not built for me.</v>

1969
01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1970
01:19:58.570 --> 01:19:59.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most,</v>

1971
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:00.733
<v Speaker 1>most people who are afraid of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who think the way you're presenting to </v>

1972
01:20:04.011 --> 01:20:05.390
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are not gonna vote for me,</v>

1973
01:20:05.420 --> 01:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to play devil's with </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself when</v>

1974
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:10.860
<v Speaker 2>you're going over these things and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I know for sure.</v>

1975
01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.990
<v Speaker 2>There are a bunch of people who are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to vote for me.</v>

1976
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:15.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still right.</v>

1977
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:18.480
<v Speaker 2>It's the right answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether I win,</v>

1978
01:20:18.481 --> 01:20:19.314
<v Speaker 2>lose or draw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I'm saying is true and right </v>

1979
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:24.060
<v Speaker 2>and there is no better alternative in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York state period.</v>

1980
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:25.163
<v Speaker 2>No other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every other person who's running is </v>

1981
01:20:27.061 --> 01:20:29.550
<v Speaker 2>saying we have to fund more fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fun,</v>

1982
01:20:29.551 --> 01:20:31.800
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to work.</v>

1983
01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.753
<v Speaker 2>That I'm sure of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anyone who knows the system also </v>

1984
01:20:34.681 --> 01:20:37.770
<v Speaker 2>knows that it is impossible that funding</v>
<v Speaker 2>more's going to work.</v>

1985
01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.880
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

1986
01:20:38.881 --> 01:20:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Because you're not changing the system </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

1987
01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:41.723
<v Speaker 2>You still just have a bunch of teachers </v>
<v Speaker 2>being told you're goal is high test </v>

1988
01:20:45.631 --> 01:20:48.930
<v Speaker 2>scores in standardized testing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's your goal.</v>

1989
01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:51.750
<v Speaker 2>That's how you're funded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how you're judged.</v>

1990
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:54.360
<v Speaker 2>That's how you decide if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay a teacher or not.</v>

1991
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:57.120
<v Speaker 2>That's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the current system.</v>

1992
01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:59.400
<v Speaker 2>And there's no opposition to that other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than you.</v>

1993
01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:00.690
<v Speaker 2>That is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1994
01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:05.580
<v Speaker 2>So everyone else wants the people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing the best to get more money.</v>

1995
01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:08.130
<v Speaker 2>The people that do school systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1996
01:21:08.131 --> 01:21:08.400
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1997
01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.233
<v Speaker 2>They judge them by standardized testing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're doing the best and now </v>

1998
01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:15.900
<v Speaker 2>they're not doing the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever's getting the best scores.</v>

1999
01:21:15.901 --> 01:21:16.734
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are the ones that are getting the </v>

2000
01:21:17.161 --> 01:21:17.911
<v Speaker 2>most money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2001
01:21:17.911 --> 01:21:19.440
<v Speaker 2>The people that are doing the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2002
01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:20.281
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to be the best,</v>

2003
01:21:20.281 --> 01:21:23.470
<v Speaker 2>best scores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The scores don't mean to me.</v>

2004
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they mean something.</v>

2005
01:21:25.441 --> 01:21:27.750
<v Speaker 2>You take a test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean,</v>

2006
01:21:27.751 --> 01:21:29.850
<v Speaker 2>it means something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means you're going to taste tech.</v>

2007
01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.690
<v Speaker 2>You're better at the test and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>publisher of the best tests.</v>

2008
01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2009
01:21:34.830 --> 01:21:35.430
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2010
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:39.660
<v Speaker 2>but test taking standardized test taking</v>
<v Speaker 2>is no indication of success.</v>

2011
01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:41.730
<v Speaker 2>What is a good indication of success?</v>

2012
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Emotional intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can't measure that.</v>

2013
01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:46.470
<v Speaker 2>And the emotional intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2014
01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:48.640
<v Speaker 2>but that's not going to work for some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his goals.</v>

2015
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2016
01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.340
<v Speaker 2>but if you're teaching kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

2017
01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:55.950
<v Speaker 2>how do you judge whether or not you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a good job,</v>

2018
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:58.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than tests,</v>

2019
01:21:58.411 --> 01:21:59.244
<v Speaker 2>how would you judge as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you judge things when they're </v>

2020
01:22:03.091 --> 01:22:03.924
<v Speaker 2>hard to judge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I bring this up in my business </v>

2021
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:06.391
<v Speaker 2>often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2022
01:22:06.391 --> 01:22:07.500
<v Speaker 2>When you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it,</v>

2023
01:22:07.501 --> 01:22:09.450
<v Speaker 2>things aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's not easy to find a win,</v>

2024
01:22:09.630 --> 01:22:11.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I don't know what a win is,</v>

2025
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:14.670
<v Speaker 2>how do I figure out what a win is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes can be challenging,</v>

2026
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.863
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2027
01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:16.740
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2028
01:22:16.740 --> 01:22:20.550
<v Speaker 2>if you own a something a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might judge it on sales,</v>

2029
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.650
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might not,</v>

2030
01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.420
<v Speaker 2>you might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might judge on or something like,</v>

2031
01:22:24.660 --> 01:22:25.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2032
01:22:25.141 --> 01:22:25.974
<v Speaker 2>how many of your competitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of your customers are a </v>

2033
01:22:28.741 --> 01:22:29.574
<v Speaker 2>professional athletes?</v>

2034
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:30.690
<v Speaker 2>You might judge it or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2035
01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:33.090
<v Speaker 2>You could find another way of judging it</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you felt the appropriate,</v>

2036
01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:34.073
<v Speaker 2>depending upon what you thought was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>win or valuable the syndicate happen in </v>

2037
01:22:37.231 --> 01:22:38.064
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could judge it by simply how many </v>

2038
01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:42.250
<v Speaker 2>parents are happy and you could judge </v>
<v Speaker 2>them by,</v>

2039
01:22:42.251 --> 01:22:43.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many show up.</v>

2040
01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.240
<v Speaker 2>You could judge them by having an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual,</v>

2041
01:22:45.241 --> 01:22:49.440
<v Speaker 2>a rating system similar to how Google </v>
<v Speaker 2>writes things or yelp rates things.</v>

2042
01:22:49.441 --> 01:22:51.800
<v Speaker 2>There's many ways you could jut getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>system to help.</v>

2043
01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could in theory shorts,</v>

2044
01:22:53.881 --> 01:22:54.714
<v Speaker 2>another option of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how would you be able to figure it </v>

2045
01:22:56.011 --> 01:22:56.844
<v Speaker 2>out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like fi spell this out for me but I </v>

2046
01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:02.910
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your question?</v>

2047
01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:05.630
<v Speaker 2>You're saying a rating system for kills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

2048
01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:09.140
<v Speaker 2>it minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could be a parent's judge.</v>

2049
01:23:09.141 --> 01:23:12.640
<v Speaker 2>The school could be the teachers do a </v>
<v Speaker 2>three 60 on themselves,</v>

2050
01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.410
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and many businesses are three 60 I don't</v>

2051
01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:15.230
<v Speaker 2>know if you know if that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2052
01:23:15.230 --> 01:23:16.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a business thing.</v>

2053
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes what'll happen is in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a business,</v>

2054
01:23:20.260 --> 01:23:21.093
<v Speaker 2>how you judge the individual is you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called a three 60 and people who </v>

2055
01:23:24.131 --> 01:23:28.000
<v Speaker 2>are around that person will judge them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually anonymously.</v>

2056
01:23:28.150 --> 01:23:33.150
<v Speaker 2>So person may be has seven juniors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven peers and three or four seniors.</v>

2057
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:34.383
<v Speaker 2>They'll pick a couple of juniors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of peers and a couple of </v>

2058
01:23:36.431 --> 01:23:37.264
<v Speaker 2>seniors who will then grade this person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called a three 60 and now that </v>

2059
01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:43.710
<v Speaker 2>person gets graded every six months or </v>
<v Speaker 2>every year or depending upon the company</v>

2060
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:44.663
<v Speaker 2>every quarter and now you know how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person is doing because everyone around </v>

2061
01:23:47.261 --> 01:23:50.140
<v Speaker 2>them is judging him or her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the teachers are judging each other.</v>

2062
01:23:50.170 --> 01:23:51.250
<v Speaker 2>They could do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2063
01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.680
<v Speaker 2>You're asking me for specific plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could be,</v>

2064
01:23:53.681 --> 01:23:54.514
<v Speaker 2>I think these are all viable plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is can be a combination </v>

2065
01:23:57.220 --> 01:24:01.720
<v Speaker 2>of viable alternative to testing to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how well children are doing.</v>

2066
01:24:01.730 --> 01:24:03.910
<v Speaker 2>It could be only thing you should write.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about graduation rate?</v>

2067
01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I like that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Graduation rate could work,</v>

2068
01:24:06.311 --> 01:24:07.144
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By what standard are they graduating if </v>

2069
01:24:08.921 --> 01:24:11.260
<v Speaker 2>they're not taking tests and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken tests.</v>

2070
01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:13.880
<v Speaker 2>They're not taking standardized tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take standards.</v>

2071
01:24:13.930 --> 01:24:16.540
<v Speaker 2>That's what I said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So taking some tests of course.</v>

2072
01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:19.180
<v Speaker 2>So you're judging them by these tests?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's correct.</v>

2073
01:24:19.181 --> 01:24:20.980
<v Speaker 2>And letting me teach standardize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is correct.</v>

2074
01:24:20.981 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 2>That's why I said difference between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tests that you would judge them on.</v>

2075
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:24.694
<v Speaker 2>And standardized test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standardized test is usually given by </v>

2076
01:24:27.311 --> 01:24:28.144
<v Speaker 2>federal or state authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's usually written someplace out of </v>

2077
01:24:30.851 --> 01:24:31.684
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's usually decided based upon the </v>

2078
01:24:33.581 --> 01:24:34.414
<v Speaker 2>company that bids the right bid and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't necessarily decide what's </v>

2079
01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:39.130
<v Speaker 2>important to the local kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also the parents.</v>

2080
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:42.820
<v Speaker 2>So what would be the difference and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>test teachers are,</v>

2081
01:24:42.821 --> 01:24:44.350
<v Speaker 2>these teachers would have their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>tests,</v>

2082
01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:49.720
<v Speaker 2>so there would be no standard that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state would enforce.</v>

2083
01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:52.240
<v Speaker 2>They would all be up to the community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

2084
01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:55.030
<v Speaker 2>Love the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea.</v>

2085
01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:57.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's let the school districts create </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own tests and the odds are they'll</v>

2086
01:24:57.911 --> 01:25:00.490
<v Speaker 2>wind up copying each other most of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time anyway.</v>

2087
01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.900
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see what works.</v>

2088
01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 2>The issue is you're assuming that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>standardized test has value.</v>

2089
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna assume me.</v>

2090
01:25:06.461 --> 01:25:07.294
<v Speaker 2>A standardized test has value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just asking you what would the </v>

2091
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:10.570
<v Speaker 2>alternative to a standardized test will </v>
<v Speaker 2>be?</v>

2092
01:25:10.630 --> 01:25:14.150
<v Speaker 2>Is is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a district wide test district.</v>

2093
01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.170
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Standardized for the district.</v>

2094
01:25:17.171 --> 01:25:18.004
<v Speaker 2>The district.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take back.</v>

2095
01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:19.151
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much better.</v>

2096
01:25:19.151 --> 01:25:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Why would that be better than for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state?</v>

2097
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:21.663
<v Speaker 2>Because each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each school district is different </v>

2098
01:25:24.460 --> 01:25:27.880
<v Speaker 2>because each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because each county in New York state is</v>

2099
01:25:27.881 --> 01:25:29.890
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each region is different.</v>

2100
01:25:30.130 --> 01:25:33.160
<v Speaker 2>They're just physically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially,</v>

2101
01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.690
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're different regions.</v>

2102
01:25:34.691 --> 01:25:36.370
<v Speaker 2>So there's sort of different standards.</v>

2103
01:25:36.370 --> 01:25:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In terms of how they graduated,</v>

2104
01:25:38.710 --> 01:25:39.543
<v Speaker 2>what an a is and what's a pass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you get through school and with </v>

2105
01:25:46.661 --> 01:25:49.300
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would it be even across the board?</v>

2106
01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:50.091
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>

2107
01:25:50.091 --> 01:25:51.940
<v Speaker 2>would you know what you mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be better.</v>

2108
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:52.953
<v Speaker 2>Would you have schools that will be be </v>
<v Speaker 2>worse and they would all have the same </v>

2109
01:25:54.851 --> 01:25:56.230
<v Speaker 2>grains?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

2110
01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:59.080
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you could easily create a system</v>

2111
01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:02.590
<v Speaker 2>to where at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning at the end,</v>

2112
01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:03.573
<v Speaker 2>at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning 16 in this case where I'm </v>

2113
01:26:04.461 --> 01:26:05.294
<v Speaker 2>talking to k through 10 at a k through </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 where there is one statewide </v>

2114
01:26:08.391 --> 01:26:09.224
<v Speaker 2>standardized test,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I said no standardized </v>

2115
01:26:10.671 --> 01:26:12.520
<v Speaker 2>testing until high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2116
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:13.663
<v Speaker 2>so prior to high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want standardized testing at </v>

2117
01:26:17.331 --> 01:26:19.820
<v Speaker 2>high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine with it at that point,</v>

2118
01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:20.654
<v Speaker 2>the kids a bit more mature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kids kind of know where they're </v>

2119
01:26:22.491 --> 01:26:23.840
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Senate,</v>

2120
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:26.120
<v Speaker 2>it have more value for them in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard because they'll know,</v>

2121
01:26:26.121 --> 01:26:26.954
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing standardized testing because </v>

2122
01:26:28.041 --> 01:26:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking do I want to go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I want to go to prep school?</v>

2123
01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Do I want it to trade school </v>
<v Speaker 2>standardized testing in high school.</v>

2124
01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.350
<v Speaker 2>This is where I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2125
01:26:36.351 --> 01:26:38.510
<v Speaker 2>so for 14 to 16 basically just two </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2126
01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:39.470
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2127
01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:40.633
<v Speaker 2>In those areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally happy with that because at </v>

2128
01:26:42.651 --> 01:26:43.484
<v Speaker 2>that point the kids are deciding where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to go and being a good test </v>

2129
01:26:45.681 --> 01:26:47.540
<v Speaker 2>taker in those years might make you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

2130
01:26:47.541 --> 01:26:49.790
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm good for sciences,</v>

2131
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:52.460
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm good for math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should be a plumber,</v>

2132
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:55.490
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should be a truck driver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I should be an insert thing here.</v>

2133
01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe for a teacher.</v>

2134
01:26:56.930 --> 01:27:01.170
<v Speaker 2>So I'm totally happy in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I said until high school doing in the</v>

2135
01:27:01.171 --> 01:27:03.860
<v Speaker 2>youth doesn't do anything except make </v>
<v Speaker 2>things bad.</v>

2136
01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:05.593
<v Speaker 2>So once we get to the high school level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah there's standardized testing at </v>

2137
01:27:07.971 --> 01:27:10.010
<v Speaker 2>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm saying before that,</v>

2138
01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.340
<v Speaker 2>but before that is when the kids are </v>
<v Speaker 2>building up who they are.</v>

2139
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Right before that was when the kids are </v>
<v Speaker 2>building up who they are as,</v>

2140
01:27:16.910 --> 01:27:17.743
<v Speaker 2>as students,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as as who they think they are in their </v>

2141
01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:19.874
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you familiar with other types of </v>

2142
01:27:21.531 --> 01:27:26.531
<v Speaker 2>teaching like wall door for some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other alternative forms of education and</v>

2143
01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:30.670
<v Speaker 2>have you ever looked at those models and</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2144
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I have not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Teacher.</v>

2145
01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:33.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have not.</v>

2146
01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:36.380
<v Speaker 2>But I'm happy to to look at those too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to look at them.</v>

2147
01:27:36.420 --> 01:27:37.253
<v Speaker 2>If those are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if those are models that would give our </v>

2148
01:27:40.581 --> 01:27:43.310
<v Speaker 2>kids an upper hand and a better chance </v>
<v Speaker 2>of success,</v>

2149
01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.560
<v Speaker 2>I would happily take them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they are,</v>

2150
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy to do that.</v>

2151
01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:48.643
<v Speaker 2>To be fair with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm trying to tell you everything </v>

2152
01:27:50.721 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 2>you're saying right now in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation we've had in the past,</v>

2153
01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.033
<v Speaker 2>hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've already come up with some </v>

2154
01:27:55.071 --> 01:27:56.420
<v Speaker 2>different ideas in such already you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

2155
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:58.670
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine what teachers were doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>was they had this,</v>

2156
01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:00.920
<v Speaker 2>the concepts and ideas they would come </v>
<v Speaker 2>up with.</v>

2157
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.160
<v Speaker 2>We can facilitate things actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>working maybe even by region,</v>

2158
01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:07.130
<v Speaker 2>maybe even by county,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe even counties that would test.</v>

2159
01:28:07.230 --> 01:28:08.063
<v Speaker 2>Even test schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schools have a test things out for a </v>

2160
01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:10.873
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You imagine even that teachers have the </v>

2161
01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:17.441
<v Speaker 2>kind of freedom to innovate and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 2>in any foreseeable future like that,</v>

2162
01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:18.800
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Decide,</v>

2163
01:28:19.730 --> 01:28:21.510
<v Speaker 2>decide some of the things that we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about now,</v>

2164
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:24.440
<v Speaker 2>third party certifications and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out.</v>

2165
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2166
01:28:26.110 --> 01:28:29.690
<v Speaker 2>What you're hearing me say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you have so many people get afraid.</v>

2167
01:28:29.850 --> 01:28:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Not saying you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many people do.</v>

2168
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:32.353
<v Speaker 2>If some talking about an actual revamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reboot of our education system where </v>

2169
01:28:35.871 --> 01:28:36.704
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical change because my state is </v>

2170
01:28:39.591 --> 01:28:43.280
<v Speaker 2>collapsing and I understand that radical</v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

2171
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:44.143
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's collapsing or do you </v>

2172
01:28:45.531 --> 01:28:47.540
<v Speaker 2>think the current numbers are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>unsustainable?</v>

2173
01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:49.150
<v Speaker 2>Is there a difference?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2174
01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.050
<v Speaker 2>the differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will still maintain,</v>

2175
01:28:51.051 --> 01:28:52.130
<v Speaker 2>but there'll be less people.</v>

2176
01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:56.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Collapsing to me seems like it's falling</v>

2177
01:28:56.181 --> 01:28:56.960
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2178
01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of people that are</v>

2179
01:28:58.641 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 2>in New York that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2180
01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:01.620
<v Speaker 2>this is too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta Outta here.</v>

2181
01:29:01.710 --> 01:29:02.543
<v Speaker 2>Which in my eyes tells me that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>cloud because you have situation where </v>

2182
01:29:04.891 --> 01:29:07.110
<v Speaker 2>you have counties that are one third </v>
<v Speaker 2>have Medicaid,</v>

2183
01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.153
<v Speaker 2>one third of Medicare with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of unfunded mandates that force </v>

2184
01:29:12.121 --> 01:29:12.954
<v Speaker 2>them to pay for certain things and with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people leaving you have a dwindling tax </v>

2185
01:29:16.291 --> 01:29:17.850
<v Speaker 2>base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So at that point,</v>

2186
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:19.500
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's collapsing.</v>

2187
01:29:19.710 --> 01:29:23.850
<v Speaker 2>At what point does it stop?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it stopping.</v>

2188
01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:26.670
<v Speaker 2>I just see larger chunks of Medicaid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Medicare,</v>

2189
01:29:27.090 --> 01:29:30.750
<v Speaker 2>and at one point when it's Medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even they pack up and head to Florida,</v>

2190
01:29:30.990 --> 01:29:33.090
<v Speaker 2>North Carolina or South Carolina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2191
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:34.223
<v Speaker 2>Families are keeping people in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>state more than anything because their </v>

2192
01:29:36.931 --> 01:29:37.950
<v Speaker 2>relatives or close by.</v>

2193
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now if they're not,</v>

2194
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:40.703
<v Speaker 2>if so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see it's continuing education out of </v>

2195
01:29:42.001 --> 01:29:45.120
<v Speaker 2>the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we've got education cured,</v>

2196
01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:47.940
<v Speaker 2>how do you make amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be amazing.</v>

2197
01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:49.073
<v Speaker 2>How do you make it more attractive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to stay in New York that don't </v>

2198
01:29:52.711 --> 01:29:53.920
<v Speaker 2>have children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yadda,</v>

2199
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:56.130
<v Speaker 2>you make it more attractive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>businesses?</v>

2200
01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Several things.</v>

2201
01:29:58.290 --> 01:29:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2202
01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.033
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to raise money through ways </v>

2203
01:30:00.930 --> 01:30:02.520
<v Speaker 2>other than taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2204
01:30:02.521 --> 01:30:03.354
<v Speaker 2>We can still raise money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can find ways to fill gaps and if we </v>

2205
01:30:06.091 --> 01:30:06.924
<v Speaker 2>have to fill a gap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say the 4 billion from the federal </v>

2206
01:30:07.981 --> 01:30:09.030
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to fill the gap.</v>

2207
01:30:09.031 --> 01:30:11.670
<v Speaker 2>If we find that the first six months of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussion,</v>

2208
01:30:12.330 --> 01:30:14.550
<v Speaker 2>there's no way we can do this without </v>
<v Speaker 2>the forebay Nelson,</v>

2209
01:30:14.551 --> 01:30:15.570
<v Speaker 2>the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

2210
01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Let's say I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say I'm wrong and the 4 billion </v>

2211
01:30:19.441 --> 01:30:21.900
<v Speaker 2>now is I want to get rid of from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>federal government is no,</v>

2212
01:30:21.901 --> 01:30:22.734
<v Speaker 2>we have to have it that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plans you've come up with that we </v>

2213
01:30:24.151 --> 01:30:24.870
<v Speaker 2>think will work.</v>

2214
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:25.703
<v Speaker 2>What card?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That money.</v>

2215
01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:26.693
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deal.</v>

2216
01:30:26.730 --> 01:30:28.200
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can still raise it some other way.</v>

2217
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:29.363
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the past we've done things very </v>

2218
01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:31.350
<v Speaker 2>poorly in New York state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've done things like,</v>

2219
01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:33.930
<v Speaker 2>let's have a lottery and a lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will pay for education.</v>

2220
01:30:33.931 --> 01:30:35.760
<v Speaker 2>Then it goes off to the general fund and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes away.</v>

2221
01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:37.470
<v Speaker 2>We can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that something like this?</v>

2222
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.950
<v Speaker 2>I talk often about using our </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure in New York state.</v>

2223
01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:42.173
<v Speaker 2>As we of raising money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have bridges and tunnels and through </v>

2224
01:30:45.621 --> 01:30:46.454
<v Speaker 2>ways and the Erie canal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about a 500 miles and about </v>

2225
01:30:48.961 --> 01:30:50.670
<v Speaker 2>three dozen locks and lots of stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2226
01:30:50.671 --> 01:30:51.504
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world do we have a bridge </v>

2227
01:30:52.651 --> 01:30:53.484
<v Speaker 2>right now in New York state that's named</v>
<v Speaker 2>after one of our previous governors </v>

2228
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:58.350
<v Speaker 2>called the Mario Cuomo bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's embarrassing.</v>

2229
01:30:58.500 --> 01:30:59.770
<v Speaker 2>We literally have an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2230
01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:01.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an imperial bridge.</v>

2231
01:31:01.231 --> 01:31:02.280
<v Speaker 2>Neva throw royal family.</v>

2232
01:31:02.670 --> 01:31:04.000
<v Speaker 2>That bridge should not be named that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2233
01:31:04.001 --> 01:31:06.570
<v Speaker 2>but she'd be the staples bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the verizon bridge,</v>

2234
01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.250
<v Speaker 2>the a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the three m bridge,</v>

2235
01:31:08.251 --> 01:31:10.650
<v Speaker 2>the Kellogg's bridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Apple Bridge,</v>

2236
01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.513
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should be leasing the naming rights </v>

2237
01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:14.400
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a business guy.</v>

2238
01:31:14.410 --> 01:31:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Want to retain the asset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't lose the asset.</v>

2239
01:31:16.740 --> 01:31:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Lisa naming rights out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2240
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.880
<v Speaker 2>These are companies that pay billions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars every year in marketing.</v>

2241
01:31:20.881 --> 01:31:21.714
<v Speaker 2>Old Time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dropped $20 million for a a a a </v>

2242
01:31:25.441 --> 01:31:28.940
<v Speaker 2>stadium that gets used on the weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead we have them pay a,</v>

2243
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:29.783
<v Speaker 2>how'd it make dollars for bridge?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's across by hundreds of thousands </v>

2244
01:31:31.741 --> 01:31:33.930
<v Speaker 2>of cars every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you call it the verizon,</v>

2245
01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.100
<v Speaker 2>the rise of rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>

2246
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:36.173
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's mentioned hundreds of times </v>

2247
01:31:38.491 --> 01:31:42.210
<v Speaker 2>every single day during rush hour in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>16 million person metro area.</v>

2248
01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:43.770
<v Speaker 2>But here the next piece is on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2249
01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:44.933
<v Speaker 2>Once he has the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're also responsible for the </v>

2250
01:31:46.411 --> 01:31:48.420
<v Speaker 2>maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to inspect the bridge,</v>

2251
01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:49.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2252
01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:51.570
<v Speaker 2>People say [inaudible] is responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for that is correct.</v>

2253
01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.500
<v Speaker 2>That's part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2254
01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:54.870
<v Speaker 2>So they have to pay you and they have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fix the bridge.</v>

2255
01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.070
<v Speaker 2>They can go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2256
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:57.223
<v Speaker 2>That's all I know is I already have </v>
<v Speaker 2>already asking me about how long is the </v>

2257
01:32:00.911 --> 01:32:01.701
<v Speaker 2>lease?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we gonna do?</v>

2258
01:32:01.701 --> 01:32:02.680
<v Speaker 2>They already love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2259
01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:03.903
<v Speaker 2>People already tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that you want them to fix it to </v>

2260
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:05.980
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2261
01:32:06.070 --> 01:32:08.320
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But be part of the contract again,</v>

2262
01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:09.393
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is a common theme that you'll </v>

2263
01:32:11.441 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 2>find that people don't like and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>

2264
01:32:13.511 --> 01:32:15.040
<v Speaker 2>you don't seem to like it either,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

2265
01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the answer for exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 2>the contract is.</v>

2266
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:19.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying I don't like and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

2267
01:32:19.541 --> 01:32:21.130
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I was verizon I'd be like,</v>

2268
01:32:21.131 --> 01:32:21.964
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Yang you guys just to put my name on </v>

2269
01:32:23.981 --> 01:32:24.070
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2270
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:25.380
<v Speaker 2>Now I've got to fix this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2271
01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.350
<v Speaker 2>there may be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

2272
01:32:26.351 --> 01:32:28.000
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe we negotiate.</v>

2273
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.580
<v Speaker 2>You pay a little bit less pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 million instead and fix the bridge.</v>

2274
01:32:30.670 --> 01:32:31.503
<v Speaker 2>But I want you fixing the bridge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a reason why she fixing the </v>

2275
01:32:33.221 --> 01:32:37.330
<v Speaker 2>bridge right now across our country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just collapse concrete cancer.</v>

2276
01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:38.920
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all old time.</v>

2277
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:39.873
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2278
01:32:39.890 --> 01:32:41.800
<v Speaker 2>and why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the government has to run it and</v>

2279
01:32:41.801 --> 01:32:44.020
<v Speaker 2>the government runs out of money or drop</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rossi fails.</v>

2280
01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in this case,</v>

2281
01:32:45.610 --> 01:32:50.530
<v Speaker 2>we would actually have someone who has </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix it so we could actually check the</v>

2282
01:32:50.531 --> 01:32:53.240
<v Speaker 2>bridge and to say it's at at a b and an </v>
<v Speaker 2>a diesel.</v>

2283
01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Osa can get to as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2284
01:32:54.581 --> 01:32:56.510
<v Speaker 2>Has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>verizon refuses to fix it.</v>

2285
01:32:56.511 --> 01:32:57.344
<v Speaker 2>It goes to see rice and fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you lose a contract and I guess now </v>

2286
01:32:59.951 --> 01:33:00.784
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be a sprint bridge.</v>

2287
01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:02.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to fix it.</v>

2288
01:33:02.650 --> 01:33:03.483
<v Speaker 2>The British who actually gets fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense to not even know what </v>

2289
01:33:05.261 --> 01:33:06.270
<v Speaker 2>that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2290
01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:07.090
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one.</v>

2291
01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:07.923
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So immediately at that point we're </v>

2292
01:33:08.831 --> 01:33:11.800
<v Speaker 2>getting money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bridge are actually getting fixed.</v>

2293
01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:13.840
<v Speaker 2>And here's the best part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the need for tolls.</v>

2294
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:17.620
<v Speaker 2>If you've been through New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know we are the toll monsters.</v>

2295
01:33:17.650 --> 01:33:19.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean we are horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's brutal.</v>

2296
01:33:19.901 --> 01:33:20.734
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a tree establish those tolls under </v>

2297
01:33:22.211 --> 01:33:24.310
<v Speaker 2>the false premise of once the bridge is </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid,</v>

2298
01:33:24.311 --> 01:33:25.960
<v Speaker 2>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2299
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Once they got addicted to that money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2300
01:33:28.451 --> 01:33:29.830
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're never paying this bitch off.</v>

2301
01:33:29.831 --> 01:33:31.090
<v Speaker 2>That is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2302
01:33:31.330 --> 01:33:32.163
<v Speaker 2>So instead they now know it's creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means now those truckers that are </v>

2303
01:33:35.111 --> 01:33:37.600
<v Speaker 2>paying a hundred bucks every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every time across that breaks,</v>

2304
01:33:37.601 --> 01:33:39.880
<v Speaker 2>they pay by the axle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those go away.</v>

2305
01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.820
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a $100 every time they cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bridge for a big truck.</v>

2306
01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:43.693
<v Speaker 2>A trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2307
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:45.880
<v Speaker 2>Cause they paid per axle dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2308
01:33:45.881 --> 01:33:47.680
<v Speaker 2>It's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is so dirty.</v>

2309
01:33:47.681 --> 01:33:50.170
<v Speaker 2>They're paying tons of money every time </v>
<v Speaker 2>across that bridge.</v>

2310
01:33:50.230 --> 01:33:52.600
<v Speaker 2>And if that goes away to see if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do that,</v>

2311
01:33:52.601 --> 01:33:54.810
<v Speaker 2>you would when the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hope so.</v>

2312
01:33:54.811 --> 01:33:57.840
<v Speaker 2>If you could figure out how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would become governance.</v>

2313
01:33:57.841 --> 01:33:59.770
<v Speaker 2>It's already be this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea is not crazy.</v>

2314
01:33:59.771 --> 01:34:00.604
<v Speaker 2>We already have a doppler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ever brought this up besides you </v>

2315
01:34:02.111 --> 01:34:04.150
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already have adopt a highway.</v>

2316
01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Fuck your education system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This shit would work.</v>

2317
01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got you on that one away.</v>

2318
01:34:08.371 --> 01:34:09.530
<v Speaker 2>So all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll tell you what,</v>

2319
01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:10.750
<v Speaker 2>we're working on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one.</v>

2320
01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:11.590
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's a better,</v>

2321
01:34:11.591 --> 01:34:12.424
<v Speaker 2>but not even done yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only at their paying for </v>

2322
01:34:13.631 --> 01:34:14.464
<v Speaker 2>maintenance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means we have lower spending </v>

2323
01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:17.050
<v Speaker 2>because we're not paying for </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance.</v>

2324
01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.273
<v Speaker 2>And his even better part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less money I have to give out for </v>

2325
01:34:21.011 --> 01:34:21.844
<v Speaker 2>these contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less corruption because I'm not giving </v>

2326
01:34:24.161 --> 01:34:25.000
<v Speaker 2>out the contracts anymore.</v>

2327
01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Verizon's given car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money do they get though in the</v>

2328
01:34:27.881 --> 01:34:32.020
<v Speaker 2>tolls over a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine it'd be bigger than $100</v>

2329
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:32.380
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2330
01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 2>no it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

2331
01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:35.020
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes it is.</v>

2332
01:34:35.021 --> 01:34:35.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2333
01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:36.970
<v Speaker 2>the tolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2334
01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:38.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of billions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2335
01:34:38.021 --> 01:34:40.300
<v Speaker 2>because the New York state budget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like a billions.</v>

2336
01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.051
<v Speaker 2>I apologize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2337
01:34:41.051 --> 01:34:42.480
<v Speaker 2>it's not $100 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's several days.</v>

2338
01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:44.590
<v Speaker 2>I think just New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken,</v>

2339
01:34:44.591 --> 01:34:46.540
<v Speaker 2>there's over 2 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2 billion a year in tolls.</v>

2340
01:34:46.570 --> 01:34:47.403
<v Speaker 2>Just know he's dead is so dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that may include people you can't </v>

2341
01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:54.760
<v Speaker 2>drive unless you give us money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to cross this line?</v>

2342
01:34:54.761 --> 01:34:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Pay Attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pit Tariff.</v>

2343
01:34:57.170 --> 01:34:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oof.</v>

2344
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:00.050
<v Speaker 2>That's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tons of money.</v>

2345
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.350
<v Speaker 2>We're so lucky here in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we could raise that money.</v>

2346
01:35:03.351 --> 01:35:05.360
<v Speaker 2>So to make you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make your education unhappy.</v>

2347
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>

2348
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll take four being off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll put it back in the teachers and the</v>

2349
01:35:08.691 --> 01:35:10.610
<v Speaker 2>money's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well how you're,</v>

2350
01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.473
<v Speaker 2>if you're taking that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me again and said I did not love </v>

2351
01:35:13.881 --> 01:35:15.770
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just finding holes in your game.</v>

2352
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Now when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about the holes,</v>

2353
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:20.600
<v Speaker 2>don't be silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No holes there.</v>

2354
01:35:20.601 --> 01:35:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Don't be silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't halls there.</v>

2355
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:22.910
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

2356
01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:23.893
<v Speaker 2>Come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you take away all that money </v>

2357
01:35:25.671 --> 01:35:28.640
<v Speaker 2>that people are paying on the toll is $2</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion a year.</v>

2358
01:35:28.730 --> 01:35:29.780
<v Speaker 2>How do you replace that?</v>

2359
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I they're paying $2 billion in young </v>
<v Speaker 2>hungry.</v>

2360
01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:37.400
<v Speaker 2>If we're getting $100 million from one </v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge,</v>

2361
01:35:37.730 --> 01:35:38.960
<v Speaker 2>that's just one bridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2362
01:35:38.961 --> 01:35:39.794
<v Speaker 2>How many bridges you got?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's over a dozen just in New York </v>

2363
01:35:41.931 --> 01:35:42.501
<v Speaker 2>City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin,</v>

2364
01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:44.120
<v Speaker 2>the MTA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't even,</v>

2365
01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.233
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even count the Erie Canal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 36 locks would get named each </v>

2366
01:35:48.201 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 2>lock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repair the entire Erie Canal.</v>

2367
01:35:50.900 --> 01:35:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Make it commercially viable without </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying any tax payer dollars whatsoever.</v>

2368
01:35:55.020 --> 01:35:55.853
<v Speaker 2>And we had McDonald's could own one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put Mcdonald's on every single log </v>

2369
01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:59.420
<v Speaker 2>lock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are for,</v>

2370
01:35:59.421 --> 01:36:00.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial boats.</v>

2371
01:36:00.900 --> 01:36:01.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2372
01:36:01.450 --> 01:36:03.230
<v Speaker 2>we can make whatever we want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now.</v>

2373
01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.430
<v Speaker 2>The Erie canal is run by the parks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rec switch it.</v>

2374
01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:09.230
<v Speaker 2>It costs us about a hundred million </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars every year,</v>

2375
01:36:09.231 --> 01:36:11.720
<v Speaker 2>including capital projects to maintain </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Erie Canal.</v>

2376
01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.673
<v Speaker 2>We make less than 5 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you crunched all the numbers on </v>

2377
01:36:14.751 --> 01:36:17.810
<v Speaker 2>putting different advertisers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sponsors?</v>

2378
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:19.250
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just different bridges.</v>

2379
01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the issue,</v>

2380
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean in theory you will absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>raise billions that I'm sure in theory,</v>

2381
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:26.960
<v Speaker 2>but you will raise billions.</v>

2382
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.540
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is you don't know which </v>
<v Speaker 2>one goes first,</v>

2383
01:36:29.541 --> 01:36:32.810
<v Speaker 2>which one is more valuable?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how long ago shades is.</v>

2384
01:36:32.811 --> 01:36:34.220
<v Speaker 2>We'll take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also don't know.</v>

2385
01:36:34.221 --> 01:36:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Will they take the throughways also what</v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge they'll take.</v>

2386
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Some just may not be viable to be taken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know each,</v>

2387
01:36:41.451 --> 01:36:42.284
<v Speaker 2>once I'm tunnels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they may not want to take and then how </v>

2388
01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:44.564
<v Speaker 2>fast was catch on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the advantage is you could do this </v>

2389
01:36:47.361 --> 01:36:50.540
<v Speaker 2>with tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do this with roadways.</v>

2390
01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean nobody gives a shit what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parkways called the Verrazano Parkway.</v>

2391
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:57.140
<v Speaker 2>It's not making anybody any money by </v>
<v Speaker 2>calling it the Verrazano Parkway.</v>

2392
01:36:57.141 --> 01:36:58.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless there's another idea.</v>

2393
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:01.430
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an iad one in upstate New York,</v>

2394
01:37:01.431 --> 01:37:04.430
<v Speaker 2>which is falling apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my idea for that is this thing,</v>

2395
01:37:04.460 --> 01:37:08.240
<v Speaker 2>how are we going to fund this interstate</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youporn youporn highway?</v>

2396
01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:09.103
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're willing to give you the most </v>

2397
01:37:09.951 --> 01:37:12.020
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'd rather do with the highway,</v>

2398
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:13.343
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'd rather the highway is have </v>

2399
01:37:16.561 --> 01:37:17.630
<v Speaker 2>instead make it a google road.</v>

2400
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:20.080
<v Speaker 2>Google road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>

2401
01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:22.220
<v Speaker 2>Save those fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grip on your state.</v>

2402
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well look,</v>

2403
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:26.810
<v Speaker 2>if they want to give me a road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's whole road here.</v>

2404
01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:27.400
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

2405
01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Here is how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get their own road,</v>

2406
01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:30.523
<v Speaker 2>they get their own road and they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it a driverless car road whenever </v>

2407
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:34.123
<v Speaker 2>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rent for that is maintenance of the </v>

2408
01:37:37.341 --> 01:37:38.540
<v Speaker 2>regular road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2409
01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:39.920
<v Speaker 2>That's the rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2410
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:43.640
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you maintained the road for free,</v>

2411
01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:45.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get to keep the next to it.</v>

2412
01:37:45.981 --> 01:37:48.740
<v Speaker 2>Google road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now people have an option.</v>

2413
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:50.980
<v Speaker 2>You want to drive in a driverless car is</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come up with that.</v>

2414
01:37:50.981 --> 01:37:52.820
<v Speaker 2>A driverless buses or whatever they come</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with.</v>

2415
01:37:52.821 --> 01:37:55.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they come up with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you take it if want to.</v>

2416
01:37:55.410 --> 01:37:58.140
<v Speaker 2>If you don't drive the regular road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Google says,</v>

2417
01:37:58.141 --> 01:37:59.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to pay for anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lose the,</v>

2418
01:38:00.060 --> 01:38:00.690
<v Speaker 2>someone else buys it.</v>

2419
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Now it becomes an Amazon road or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>battlecat,</v>

2420
01:38:02.750 --> 01:38:04.690
<v Speaker 2>whatever road becomes apple road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2421
01:38:04.691 --> 01:38:05.524
<v Speaker 2>It was so will and it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense to me and I liked that </v>

2422
01:38:08.821 --> 01:38:11.190
<v Speaker 2>because nobody really gives a shit what </v>
<v Speaker 2>a road that's correct.</v>

2423
01:38:11.191 --> 01:38:12.390
<v Speaker 2>It's called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why you don't,</v>

2424
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:15.570
<v Speaker 2>you don't name the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You give them a road next to it,</v>

2425
01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:16.710
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

2426
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:17.761
<v Speaker 2>That they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

2427
01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:18.594
<v Speaker 2>but you can use that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can either what they want to just </v>

2428
01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:21.720
<v Speaker 2>to transfer their goods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Amazon,</v>

2429
01:38:21.721 --> 01:38:24.630
<v Speaker 2>it can be an amazon hub that just moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon products.</v>

2430
01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:25.501
<v Speaker 2>Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

2431
01:38:25.501 --> 01:38:27.990
<v Speaker 2>As long as you maintain the regular </v>
<v Speaker 2>road,</v>

2432
01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:31.860
<v Speaker 2>do what you want with the other road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What other road is this again,</v>

2433
01:38:31.890 --> 01:38:33.030
<v Speaker 2>it could be an Amazon road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where did,</v>

2434
01:38:33.270 --> 01:38:35.580
<v Speaker 2>the only thing is is the hub to move </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon products back and forth.</v>

2435
01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:36.810
<v Speaker 2>It's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

2436
01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:38.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to know what this is.</v>

2437
01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:40.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not required.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2438
01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:42.150
<v Speaker 2>They will figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what works for them.</v>

2439
01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:44.820
<v Speaker 2>That's an innovative way to generate </v>
<v Speaker 2>income.</v>

2440
01:38:44.850 --> 01:38:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bridges the roads.</v>

2441
01:38:46.710 --> 01:38:47.543
<v Speaker 2>Not even done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The MTN is subway ride the subway plan </v>

2442
01:38:49.351 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 2>right now the answer is the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give them more money.</v>

2443
01:38:52.110 --> 01:38:54.540
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be a hostage to the MTA</v>

2444
01:38:54.541 --> 01:38:56.370
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The t-mobile subway.</v>

2445
01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:57.241
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that.</v>

2446
01:38:57.241 --> 01:38:58.970
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead I don't want no,</v>

2447
01:38:59.060 --> 01:38:59.893
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead.</v>

2448
01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:00.733
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause I think anybody would care about </v>

2449
01:39:01.141 --> 01:39:03.350
<v Speaker 2>that anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issue is this older airlines,</v>

2450
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.673
<v Speaker 2>there are rail lines that the MTA </v>
<v Speaker 2>crosses about 11 I think or maybe even </v>

2451
01:39:07.831 --> 01:39:09.630
<v Speaker 2>12 different counter things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>11 different counties.</v>

2452
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:10.583
<v Speaker 2>So it's all over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So and not have these lines we at night </v>

2453
01:39:12.661 --> 01:39:13.494
<v Speaker 2>aren't used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why don't they freight lines that </v>

2454
01:39:16.831 --> 01:39:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Amazon move its product from upstate New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York into Manhattan on a freight line.</v>

2455
01:39:20.761 --> 01:39:21.594
<v Speaker 2>Is that being used at night?</v>

2456
01:39:21.810 --> 01:39:22.890
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the fee for that?</v>

2457
01:39:23.130 --> 01:39:25.980
<v Speaker 2>Fix the lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed the lines,</v>

2458
01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:29.090
<v Speaker 2>fixed them and maintain them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a viable alternatives?</v>

2459
01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Run this by people with a good sense for</v>

2460
01:39:31.470 --> 01:39:32.450
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People really liked the idea.</v>

2461
01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:33.450
<v Speaker 2>Suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2462
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:35.550
<v Speaker 2>I live in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in New York City,</v>

2463
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.010
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Queens.</v>

2464
01:39:38.011 --> 01:39:38.844
<v Speaker 2>I work in Manhattan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know lots of bankers and I asked him </v>

2465
01:39:40.441 --> 01:39:42.000
<v Speaker 2>these questions and they all say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2466
01:39:42.001 --> 01:39:42.834
<v Speaker 2>nice idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they say no to some stuff I </v>

2467
01:39:44.131 --> 01:39:44.970
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these,</v>

2468
01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:48.090
<v Speaker 2>they say they actually asked how long </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lease would be on the bridge.</v>

2469
01:39:48.450 --> 01:39:49.283
<v Speaker 2>They went that far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I say like the bridge of </v>

2470
01:39:51.431 --> 01:39:52.710
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd like to bridge it into a obviously</v>

2471
01:39:52.711 --> 01:39:53.580
<v Speaker 2>a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good idea.</v>

2472
01:39:53.581 --> 01:39:56.400
<v Speaker 2>They like it very much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the answer all your idea.</v>

2473
01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Of course she got a lock that shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why stealing?</v>

2474
01:39:59.150 --> 01:40:02.130
<v Speaker 2>Let Cynthia Nixon let let them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

2475
01:40:02.131 --> 01:40:05.750
<v Speaker 2>you just came out with the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is so important because win,</v>

2476
01:40:05.751 --> 01:40:09.600
<v Speaker 2>lose or draw everything I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about stays and we'll fix my state.</v>

2477
01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:10.913
<v Speaker 2>People say all the time like what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens if everyone takes all your </v>

2478
01:40:12.271 --> 01:40:13.110
<v Speaker 2>ideas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

2479
01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:15.390
<v Speaker 2>I'll go home and go back to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can stop doing this.</v>

2480
01:40:15.630 --> 01:40:16.463
<v Speaker 2>So the reason why you're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just cause you want to affect </v>

2481
01:40:19.501 --> 01:40:21.840
<v Speaker 2>change in New York?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2482
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:23.550
<v Speaker 2>There are three reasons why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one,</v>

2483
01:40:23.551 --> 01:40:26.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to leave New York and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>noticing change.</v>

2484
01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:27.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever go to North Carolina?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

2485
01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:30.190
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that barbecue.</v>

2486
01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I get it and I don't and I don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

2487
01:40:33.210 --> 01:40:34.830
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop teasing me.</v>

2488
01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:36.630
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go.</v>

2489
01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:39.150
<v Speaker 2>That's the number one reason is I want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stay in New York.</v>

2490
01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:40.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one.</v>

2491
01:40:40.560 --> 01:40:43.530
<v Speaker 2>But also I want to change the state for </v>
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>

2492
01:40:43.890 --> 01:40:46.710
<v Speaker 2>but even more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can change the nation for better.</v>

2493
01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:50.070
<v Speaker 2>When New York can be the place where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>will look and go,</v>

2494
01:40:50.071 --> 01:40:51.360
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

2495
01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.100
<v Speaker 2>We can start doing these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even done.</v>

2496
01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talking about a small business,</v>

2497
01:40:56.111 --> 01:40:59.350
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming has a law right now that says,</v>

2498
01:40:59.351 --> 01:41:02.590
<v Speaker 2>if you're a small farmer and you agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>to not sell outside of Wyoming,</v>

2499
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:03.663
<v Speaker 2>that you're immune from federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulatory bodies helps the small </v>

2500
01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:07.780
<v Speaker 2>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get a leg up.</v>

2501
01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:09.173
<v Speaker 2>There's something in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why can't they just for every </v>

2502
01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:11.800
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every small business,</v>

2503
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:12.843
<v Speaker 2>if you agree you will only sell locally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you being bothered by the </v>

2504
01:41:15.530 --> 01:41:16.363
<v Speaker 2>program and how does uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the commerce clause come into effect </v>

2505
01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:18.753
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

2506
01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:21.640
<v Speaker 2>So how about we make that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that applies to all restaurants.</v>

2507
01:41:21.641 --> 01:41:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

2508
01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:23.103
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But unless some border restaurants </v>

2509
01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:26.890
<v Speaker 2>actually deliver across the border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2510
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:28.870
<v Speaker 2>So you live across the border now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't work.</v>

2511
01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:29.980
<v Speaker 2>And what will get delivered?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

2512
01:41:29.981 --> 01:41:31.270
<v Speaker 2>If you deliver across the board doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2513
01:41:31.330 --> 01:41:33.280
<v Speaker 2>If you don't deliver or don't cross the </v>
<v Speaker 2>border,</v>

2514
01:41:33.281 --> 01:41:34.114
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about if you used one of those </v>

2515
01:41:34.721 --> 01:41:37.450
<v Speaker 2>third party delivery services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know where they are using an app and</v>

2516
01:41:37.451 --> 01:41:38.284
<v Speaker 2>they order something and the APP would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the people who are actually doing </v>

2517
01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:42.100
<v Speaker 2>delivery would be responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would not.</v>

2518
01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As long as that.</v>

2519
01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:44.950
<v Speaker 2>As long as that company's based in New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York state.</v>

2520
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:47.320
<v Speaker 2>So this keeps all the money in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>state?</v>

2521
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:48.303
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does give all the money in your </v>

2522
01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:49.590
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good amount of it.</v>

2523
01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:54.600
<v Speaker 2>It gives the small business owner a shot</v>
<v Speaker 2>at competing as large businesses,</v>

2524
01:41:54.851 --> 01:41:57.180
<v Speaker 2>which almost always cross borders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2525
01:41:57.250 --> 01:41:59.170
<v Speaker 2>Gives farmers a much greater incentive.</v>

2526
01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:02.470
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be more farm to table less stuff.</v>

2527
01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:03.613
<v Speaker 2>Now I've gotta help my farmers out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My New York state farmers are hurting </v>

2528
01:42:05.111 --> 01:42:06.490
<v Speaker 2>badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one idea.</v>

2529
01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.473
<v Speaker 2>But a second thing is you want to treat </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers like small businesses and </v>

2530
01:42:09.941 --> 01:42:10.774
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means they don't get the SBA </v>

2531
01:42:12.101 --> 01:42:13.570
<v Speaker 2>loans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't get help.</v>

2532
01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:14.433
<v Speaker 2>They'll get treated that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does not work when you treat them </v>

2533
01:42:15.611 --> 01:42:19.750
<v Speaker 2>like small businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But next I want to completely legalize a</v>

2534
01:42:19.751 --> 01:42:22.480
<v Speaker 2>hemp and cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then whenever you're talking,</v>

2535
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.300
<v Speaker 2>and I want to regulate them like onions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>onions,</v>

2536
01:42:25.330 --> 01:42:27.310
<v Speaker 2>like onions and my joking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like onions,</v>

2537
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:29.630
<v Speaker 2>onions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the reason why a lot of onions come</v>

2538
01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:30.880
<v Speaker 2>out of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2539
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:33.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as my onions and no one cares.</v>

2540
01:42:33.650 --> 01:42:35.020
<v Speaker 2>Bingo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly correct.</v>

2541
01:42:35.021 --> 01:42:35.854
<v Speaker 2>And here's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are three reasons why I want to </v>

2542
01:42:36.561 --> 01:42:39.430
<v Speaker 2>leave lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hemp and cannabis and most of the things</v>

2543
01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.240
<v Speaker 2>you want to get high.</v>

2544
01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:41.073
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only drug I use is cannabis because </v>

2545
01:42:42.610 --> 01:42:44.080
<v Speaker 2>cannabis is a caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2546
01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:45.220
<v Speaker 2>buff cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the only drug.</v>

2547
01:42:45.221 --> 01:42:46.054
<v Speaker 2>Freud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2548
01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:47.410
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's about cannabis.</v>

2549
01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:49.180
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I use cannabis,</v>

2550
01:42:49.210 --> 01:42:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I would happily tell you so I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>him to hide.</v>

2551
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:52.783
<v Speaker 2>Why not happily tell you don't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That my thing [inaudible] paranoid and </v>

2552
01:42:55.871 --> 01:42:57.190
<v Speaker 2>worried about the school system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get hired.</v>

2553
01:42:57.191 --> 01:43:00.550
<v Speaker 2>I think I talk even more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk even more,</v>

2554
01:43:00.551 --> 01:43:01.170
<v Speaker 2>do I?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody.</v>

2555
01:43:01.170 --> 01:43:04.420
<v Speaker 2>I would have my grampy introspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might sit back and go,</v>

2556
01:43:04.421 --> 01:43:05.470
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk too much.</v>

2557
01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe then I could mushrooms.</v>

2558
01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Then I could do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never done mushrooms.</v>

2559
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I never want to do mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I talked too much,</v>

2560
01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:13.370
<v Speaker 2>so maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should try them one day.</v>

2561
01:43:13.371 --> 01:43:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I've never done mushrooms and mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes me uncomfortable.</v>

2562
01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:16.391
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2614
01:44:44.481 --> 01:44:46.080
<v Speaker 2>Business?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2615
01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:48.950
<v Speaker 2>first it was military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a marine for seven years and then,</v>

2616
01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:51.230
<v Speaker 2>and then it was business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2617
01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2618
01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:54.500
<v Speaker 2>keep your nose to the grindstone kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>

2619
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:56.600
<v Speaker 2>Get this done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How else could I do this?</v>

2620
01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:57.493
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen my campaign?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the last three gubernatorial </v>

2621
01:45:01.701 --> 01:45:06.701
<v Speaker 2>campaigns in New York state combined </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't raise $10,000 combined.</v>

2622
01:45:07.190 --> 01:45:08.023
<v Speaker 2>I raised over a quarter million already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last three gubernatorial candidates </v>

2623
01:45:10.821 --> 01:45:11.654
<v Speaker 2>combined didn't do anywhere near the </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of stops I've made and I slept </v>

2624
01:45:14.001 --> 01:45:15.410
<v Speaker 2>too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how much is Cynthia Nixon?</v>

2625
01:45:15.411 --> 01:45:17.630
<v Speaker 2>Raise a 1.7,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2626
01:45:17.631 --> 01:45:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Male,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2627
01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:19.280
<v Speaker 2>ain't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is crazy.</v>

2628
01:45:19.281 --> 01:45:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I think people are getting behind sex in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city a lot.</v>

2629
01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.750
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that menopause money </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>

2630
01:45:23.751 --> 01:45:25.100
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need some of that,</v>

2631
01:45:25.101 --> 01:45:26.060
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

2632
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:29.150
<v Speaker 2>It's flickering around my point being </v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

2633
01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:31.250
<v Speaker 2>nose to the grindstone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this.</v>

2634
01:45:31.251 --> 01:45:32.380
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

2635
01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Literally no mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no mushrooms,</v>

2636
01:45:34.750 --> 01:45:35.780
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe later,</v>

2637
01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:39.080
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait till November 7th and then once you</v>

2638
01:45:39.081 --> 01:45:41.720
<v Speaker 2>hit then maybe we'll see maybe your </v>
<v Speaker 2>party with me.</v>

2639
01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if I win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it while while I'm governor.</v>

2640
01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:45.920
<v Speaker 2>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>

2641
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:48.500
<v Speaker 2>that would be not cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but marijuana,</v>

2642
01:45:48.650 --> 01:45:50.120
<v Speaker 2>isn't it legal in New York state?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2643
01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:52.340
<v Speaker 2>still not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to have serious diseases,</v>

2644
01:45:52.341 --> 01:45:53.174
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

2645
01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.540
<v Speaker 2>Medical and you fix that of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why the point?</v>

2646
01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:57.403
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems really proposed to my whole </v>

2647
01:45:58.581 --> 01:46:01.820
<v Speaker 2>point on cannabis and hemp is heavily </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of farmers also,</v>

2648
01:46:01.821 --> 01:46:02.654
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2649
01:46:02.710 --> 01:46:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Small farmers right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2650
01:46:04.911 --> 01:46:05.601
<v Speaker 2>Particularly has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

2651
01:46:05.601 --> 01:46:06.434
<v Speaker 2>Hoadley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncontroversial and it's a fantastic </v>

2652
01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:08.630
<v Speaker 2>commodity.</v>

2653
01:46:08.630 --> 01:46:10.550
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good for the soil,</v>

2654
01:46:10.551 --> 01:46:14.510
<v Speaker 2>it's good for the environment and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best thing is if you treat small farmers</v>

2655
01:46:14.511 --> 01:46:16.820
<v Speaker 2>like small businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can now specialize,</v>

2656
01:46:17.210 --> 01:46:20.750
<v Speaker 2>meaning they can specialize in hip and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then also create products in their farm.</v>

2657
01:46:21.110 --> 01:46:21.943
<v Speaker 2>Then with specialized hemp products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do that and create niche </v>

2658
01:46:24.771 --> 01:46:25.870
<v Speaker 2>industries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2659
01:46:25.890 --> 01:46:26.723
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we see that in New York state with </v>

2660
01:46:27.051 --> 01:46:29.420
<v Speaker 2>both coffee and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and breweries,</v>

2661
01:46:29.630 --> 01:46:30.710
<v Speaker 2>we said already happening in New York </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

2662
01:46:30.740 --> 01:46:35.360
<v Speaker 2>And you would have the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives for them to sell in New York.</v>

2663
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:36.590
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2664
01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:37.453
<v Speaker 2>So particularly hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be incredibly beneficial </v>

2665
01:46:39.141 --> 01:46:40.760
<v Speaker 2>with zero controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

2666
01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:43.790
<v Speaker 2>In terms of like psychoactive effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have people,</v>

2667
01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:45.440
<v Speaker 2>people would be very happy to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2668
01:46:45.710 --> 01:46:46.543
<v Speaker 2>But cannabis too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I want you to be able to create </v>

2669
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:50.250
<v Speaker 2>cannabis products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's something else</v>

2670
01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:51.113
<v Speaker 1>and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people in this </v>

2671
01:46:51.661 --> 01:46:52.494
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell about New York state </v>

2672
01:46:53.171 --> 01:46:56.550
<v Speaker 1>civically who have chronic pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And right now they have three choices,</v>

2673
01:46:56.640 --> 01:46:59.670
<v Speaker 1>one opioid and maybe get addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer,</v>

2674
01:46:59.700 --> 01:47:02.310
<v Speaker 1>which I don't accept all three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What people tell me,</v>

2675
01:47:02.311 --> 01:47:03.270
<v Speaker 1>and for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2676
01:47:03.271 --> 01:47:04.440
<v Speaker 1>it's only been women who have told me </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2677
01:47:04.620 --> 01:47:06.120
<v Speaker 1>they walk up to me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2678
01:47:06.121 --> 01:47:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Laurie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope we can legalize marijuana because</v>

2679
01:47:08.251 --> 01:47:10.110
<v Speaker 1>I smoke a little at night so I can go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

2680
01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:12.840
<v Speaker 1>What about cbd?</v>
<v Speaker 1>CBD is legal in your state?</v>

2681
01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

2682
01:47:14.101 --> 01:47:16.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2683
01:47:16.230 --> 01:47:17.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good question.</v>

2684
01:47:17.041 --> 01:47:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2685
01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:19.340
<v Speaker 1>My medicinal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2686
01:47:19.340 --> 01:47:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably medicinal cbd.</v>

2687
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:23.100
<v Speaker 1>Probably minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be my assumption.</v>

2688
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:27.240
<v Speaker 1>But CBD has no psychoactive effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it comes out of it.</v>

2689
01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.380
<v Speaker 1>It comes from cannabis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2690
01:47:28.410 --> 01:47:30.900
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is,</v>

2691
01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.430
<v Speaker 1>look it up real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>

2692
01:47:32.431 --> 01:47:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it's medical in New York state </v>
<v Speaker 1>did some sort of a doctor's prescription</v>

2693
01:47:36.271 --> 01:47:38.410
<v Speaker 1>to get cbd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my point is if it's onion,</v>

2694
01:47:38.411 --> 01:47:39.630
<v Speaker 1>you can grow in your backyard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2695
01:47:39.670 --> 01:47:40.503
<v Speaker 1>Great medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your backyard,</v>

2696
01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:42.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we heavily,</v>

2697
01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.433
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we heavily regulate cannabis and or </v>

2698
01:47:45.781 --> 01:47:47.610
<v Speaker 1>hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big business wins,</v>

2699
01:47:47.730 --> 01:47:51.570
<v Speaker 1>small business loses guaranteed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll become big business cronyism.</v>

2700
01:47:51.690 --> 01:47:54.300
<v Speaker 1>The small farmers collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the wrong answer.</v>

2701
01:47:54.330 --> 01:47:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need to make that happen.</v>

2702
01:47:55.921 --> 01:47:58.830
<v Speaker 1>And people already smoking it and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to smoke it.</v>

2703
01:47:58.831 --> 01:48:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you have an edible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't Ya,</v>

2704
01:48:00.811 --> 01:48:01.644
<v Speaker 1>I have liquid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you have whatever is your </v>

2705
01:48:02.821 --> 01:48:04.110
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to smell it.</v>

2706
01:48:04.111 --> 01:48:05.190
<v Speaker 1>If you want to smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please smoke it.</v>

2707
01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.590
<v Speaker 1>But there's many ways of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of taking advantage of,</v>

2708
01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:11.220
<v Speaker 1>of both thc and cbd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you prefer.</v>

2709
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And look at your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not mine.</v>

2710
01:48:13.440 --> 01:48:14.273
<v Speaker 1>And why in the world what I want you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to live with chronic pain if you </v>

2711
01:48:16.921 --> 01:48:19.560
<v Speaker 1>don't have to write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you see,</v>

2712
01:48:19.561 --> 01:48:22.340
<v Speaker 1>because cbd again is not psychoactive </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't legal.</v>

2713
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:23.581
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2714
01:48:23.581 --> 01:48:24.720
<v Speaker 1>It is legal in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

2715
01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:27.240
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty legal everywhere.</v>

2716
01:48:27.241 --> 01:48:28.074
<v Speaker 1>CBD because of the fact that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have any psychoactive effects and it's </v>

2717
01:48:31.710 --> 01:48:35.250
<v Speaker 1>fantastic for people with arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we got older folks are,</v>

2718
01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit,</v>

2719
01:48:36.481 --> 01:48:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I got Ted nugent taken it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about like that?</v>

2720
01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:43.770
<v Speaker 1>He's never even touched anything tech </v>
<v Speaker 1>related does he likes my facebook stuff?</v>

2721
01:48:43.830 --> 01:48:45.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things can be Ted likes.</v>

2722
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Is that your second amendment proponent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

2723
01:48:48.971 --> 01:48:49.804
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very true.</v>

2724
01:48:50.120 --> 01:48:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2725
01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:52.253
<v Speaker 1>there's an issue that I have with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonizing the National Rifle </v>

2726
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:56.303
<v Speaker 1>Association.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one big issue is they always point </v>

2727
01:48:57.421 --> 01:48:59.250
<v Speaker 1>to these school shootings and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it,</v>

2728
01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:02.160
<v Speaker 1>not a single NRA member has ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed.</v>

2729
01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:04.890
<v Speaker 1>One of these mass shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not NRA members.</v>

2730
01:49:05.130 --> 01:49:09.180
<v Speaker 1>So you guys are going after people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are fighting for the right for people to</v>

2731
01:49:09.181 --> 01:49:13.950
<v Speaker 1>have arms when there's people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking these arms and they're using them</v>

2732
01:49:13.951 --> 01:49:15.470
<v Speaker 1>completely illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2733
01:49:15.490 --> 01:49:17.940
<v Speaker 1>None of them are in the NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

2734
01:49:18.090 --> 01:49:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find a boogie man.</v>

2735
01:49:20.250 --> 01:49:21.083
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that boogeyman is culturally </v>

2736
01:49:21.901 --> 01:49:22.750
<v Speaker 1>accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2737
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:23.663
<v Speaker 1>And it's really confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's not helped by the fact </v>

2738
01:49:26.821 --> 01:49:28.950
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of people that are nra </v>
<v Speaker 1>proponents get,</v>

2739
01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:30.133
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dig their heels in the sand and </v>

2740
01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:32.753
<v Speaker 1>they fight hard and very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally so against people who are </v>

2741
01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:41.400
<v Speaker 1>against the NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it becomes this tribal thing.</v>

2742
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:42.770
<v Speaker 1>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the tribal issues,</v>

2743
01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:44.130
<v Speaker 1>the biggest issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree.</v>

2744
01:49:44.490 --> 01:49:46.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a point where you're not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to each other.</v>

2745
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:48.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why</v>

2746
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I say the third party is the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2747
01:49:51.370 --> 01:49:53.620
<v Speaker 2>people ask Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you win this thing here?</v>

2748
01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:54.850
<v Speaker 2>And I hear it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the biggest,</v>

2749
01:49:55.150 --> 01:49:58.870
<v Speaker 2>the biggest critique I get is you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>win,</v>

2750
01:49:58.871 --> 01:49:59.704
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you do when you can't play in </v>

2751
01:50:00.531 --> 01:50:01.780
<v Speaker 2>that too?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Particularly right now,</v>

2752
01:50:01.781 --> 01:50:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some Democrats to,</v>

2753
01:50:03.490 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 2>they're heavily said you can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't win.</v>

2754
01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:06.460
<v Speaker 2>You can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to answer,</v>

2755
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:08.390
<v Speaker 2>there are some aren't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2756
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:09.281
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some are,</v>

2757
01:50:09.281 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 2>some aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the two things,</v>

2758
01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:13.690
<v Speaker 2>remember that the first thing is I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>win.</v>

2759
01:50:13.900 --> 01:50:14.733
<v Speaker 2>And here's the reason why the Republican</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot win because there's only about </v>

2760
01:50:17.861 --> 01:50:18.694
<v Speaker 2>two and a half million Republicans in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York state and about 600 million </v>

2761
01:50:20.710 --> 01:50:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Democrats in New York state give or take</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2762
01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:25.660
<v Speaker 2>the tribalism we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a Democrat,</v>

2763
01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:28.430
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to vote for Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're a Republican,</v>

2764
01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:31.520
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to vote Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you might vote for the material.</v>

2765
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:34.270
<v Speaker 2>You might have up with somebody who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not the other evil guy.</v>

2766
01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:37.240
<v Speaker 2>So I have the option of getting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

2767
01:50:37.241 --> 01:50:38.074
<v Speaker 2>I can get the other guys and I can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>the setting percent of New Yorkers who </v>

2768
01:50:41.171 --> 01:50:42.700
<v Speaker 2>don't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get those.</v>

2769
01:50:42.701 --> 01:50:45.040
<v Speaker 2>So there's a chance to win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Add on top of that.</v>

2770
01:50:45.041 --> 01:50:47.860
<v Speaker 2>A five way race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only getting 30% to win.</v>

2771
01:50:48.130 --> 01:50:50.140
<v Speaker 2>This is a winnable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist can be done.</v>

2772
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:53.260
<v Speaker 2>But let's say I'm wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been wrong.</v>

2773
01:50:53.290 --> 01:50:54.123
<v Speaker 2>Maybe all my ideas are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe every hole you found is a is a </v>

2774
01:50:57.221 --> 01:50:58.054
<v Speaker 2>real hole and it can't be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe they all destroy me and they </v>

2775
01:51:01.181 --> 01:51:04.300
<v Speaker 2>beat me up and I can't win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get rid of those poles and you win bro.</v>

2776
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Get those fucking balls out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get those tolls.</v>

2777
01:51:08.410 --> 01:51:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Not polls rather tolls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You mean you told us,</v>

2778
01:51:10.580 --> 01:51:12.310
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can win the whole thing,</v>

2779
01:51:12.340 --> 01:51:13.630
<v Speaker 2>but say I'm wrong and I can't win.</v>

2780
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I just come in second,</v>

2781
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I beat the Republican.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only imagine what it does for the state.</v>

2782
01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:19.953
<v Speaker 2>The first thing it does is it shows them</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a third party can actually have </v>

2783
01:51:22.241 --> 01:51:23.074
<v Speaker 2>impact in New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which changed the entire nation off the </v>

2784
01:51:25.301 --> 01:51:26.090
<v Speaker 2>bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>

2785
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:27.370
<v Speaker 2>third parties without thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

2786
01:51:27.371 --> 01:51:29.620
<v Speaker 2>we can do something in a big state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2787
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:31.960
<v Speaker 2>And something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll make better republicans and better</v>

2788
01:51:31.961 --> 01:51:33.610
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause right now,</v>

2789
01:51:33.611 --> 01:51:35.590
<v Speaker 2>neither of them does anything for </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

2790
01:51:35.591 --> 01:51:38.170
<v Speaker 2>They don't care if nothing gets done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when there's a third party,</v>

2791
01:51:38.171 --> 01:51:40.480
<v Speaker 2>I become the referee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one who says,</v>

2792
01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:41.493
<v Speaker 2>Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be about civil </v>

2793
01:51:42.191 --> 01:51:43.810
<v Speaker 2>liberties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not what's wrong?</v>

2794
01:51:44.110 --> 01:51:44.943
<v Speaker 2>Republican's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be about less </v>

2795
01:51:45.461 --> 01:51:47.650
<v Speaker 2>government and second amendment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>small business.</v>

2796
01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:49.570
<v Speaker 2>You're not what's wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now the media,</v>

2797
01:51:49.571 --> 01:51:50.404
<v Speaker 2>here's me now people hear me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to become better because if </v>

2798
01:51:53.591 --> 01:51:54.424
<v Speaker 2>they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll come to me instead and they'll </v>

2799
01:51:55.391 --> 01:51:57.790
<v Speaker 2>see it and had a fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll begin to change.</v>

2800
01:51:57.950 --> 01:52:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Now what do you think about this move </v>
<v Speaker 1>toward Democratic Socialism?</v>

2801
01:52:01.401 --> 01:52:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And you're seeing this a lot in young </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids in particular.</v>

2802
01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:09.290
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be abandoning this old </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and trying to adopt a,</v>

2803
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:12.520
<v Speaker 1>a much more radical left wing system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2804
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:15.110
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's some real problems.</v>

2805
01:52:15.111 --> 01:52:16.210
<v Speaker 1>That lady who won,</v>

2806
01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:18.840
<v Speaker 2>she's literally my congresswoman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't,</v>

2807
01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:19.541
<v Speaker 2>my counseling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2808
01:52:19.541 --> 01:52:20.374
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>AOC.</v>

2809
01:52:20.480 --> 01:52:23.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alexandria ocasio Alexandria.</v>

2810
01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bushy Cortez.</v>

2811
01:52:25.001 --> 01:52:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Was</v>

2812
01:52:25.260 --> 01:52:25.510
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2813
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:26.343
<v Speaker 1>was that true or they smear on her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is it true that she used to be a </v>

2814
01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Republican?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antiabortion uh,</v>

2815
01:52:32.100 --> 01:52:33.580
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Person.</v>

2816
01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that she's really from Florida.</v>

2817
01:52:36.850 --> 01:52:37.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2818
01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people are so terrified</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her and yet you know,</v>

2819
01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:44.830
<v Speaker 1>and attacking her and she's made some </v>
<v Speaker 1>missteps too.</v>

2820
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on her</v>

2821
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:49.310
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to realize is socialism for most</v>

2822
01:52:49.311 --> 01:52:50.144
<v Speaker 2>Americans today till the young young </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones is just the newest ideology of </v>

2823
01:52:53.781 --> 01:52:54.790
<v Speaker 2>rebellion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bright.</v>

2824
01:52:54.900 --> 01:52:56.570
<v Speaker 2>It's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them don't know.</v>

2825
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Most of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the youngsters particularly who actually</v>

2826
01:52:59.091 --> 01:53:01.880
<v Speaker 2>supported Bernie couldn't tell you any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his policies.</v>

2827
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:03.073
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just knew he wasn't the </v>

2828
01:53:04.041 --> 01:53:05.750
<v Speaker 2>establishment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disabled trump though.</v>

2829
01:53:05.780 --> 01:53:07.000
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people swear trump </v>
<v Speaker 2>who would,</v>

2830
01:53:07.010 --> 01:53:09.740
<v Speaker 2>couldn't tell you one policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's things he was in rebellion.</v>

2831
01:53:09.770 --> 01:53:12.560
<v Speaker 2>The Bernie says that that resonate with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

2832
01:53:12.710 --> 01:53:13.543
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is that there's income </v>

2833
01:53:15.591 --> 01:53:17.450
<v Speaker 2>inequality in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very true.</v>

2834
01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people say,</v>

2835
01:53:19.581 --> 01:53:20.414
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the game is rigged and Bernie is </v>

2836
01:53:21.211 --> 01:53:22.400
<v Speaker 2>going to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2837
01:53:22.610 --> 01:53:23.391
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game is rigged.</v>

2838
01:53:23.391 --> 01:53:25.250
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't quality.</v>

2839
01:53:25.251 --> 01:53:26.090
<v Speaker 2>It's having,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's true,</v>

2840
01:53:26.480 --> 01:53:27.770
<v Speaker 2>but it's rick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of corruption,</v>

2841
01:53:27.771 --> 01:53:28.940
<v Speaker 2>because of the two party system.</v>

2842
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:31.960
<v Speaker 2>It's rigged because of crony capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2843
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:33.470
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's rigged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is rigged.</v>

2844
01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:38.300
<v Speaker 2>The problem is you have a system where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people keep saying it's the free market,</v>

2845
01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:40.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happened with Obamacare,</v>

2846
01:53:40.071 --> 01:53:41.210
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with obamacare.</v>

2847
01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:41.631
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2848
01:53:41.631 --> 01:53:42.890
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have markets,</v>

2849
01:53:42.891 --> 01:53:43.724
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have the market place where you can </v>

2850
01:53:44.541 --> 01:53:47.450
<v Speaker 2>go buy insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what people that heard was,</v>

2851
01:53:47.480 --> 01:53:48.710
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a free market.</v>

2852
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:50.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not a free market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what they heard.</v>

2853
01:53:50.631 --> 01:53:51.464
<v Speaker 2>It was a free market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then when obamacare fails in certain </v>

2854
01:53:53.901 --> 01:53:54.800
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do they say?</v>

2855
01:53:55.130 --> 01:53:56.360
<v Speaker 2>The market didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2856
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:58.820
<v Speaker 2>we need single payer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The market didn't work.</v>

2857
01:53:58.821 --> 01:54:01.250
<v Speaker 2>We need single payer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how it's spun.</v>

2858
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:02.660
<v Speaker 2>And single payer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2859
01:54:02.661 --> 01:54:03.710
<v Speaker 2>single payer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the right answer?</v>

2860
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:05.930
<v Speaker 2>It's Medicare for all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2861
01:54:05.931 --> 01:54:06.764
<v Speaker 2>that sounds amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it won't be what it will be as va </v>

2862
01:54:09.771 --> 01:54:12.290
<v Speaker 2>for all and the va to disaster.</v>

2863
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:15.410
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a two tiered system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said disaster.</v>

2864
01:54:15.620 --> 01:54:16.453
<v Speaker 2>And what most we don't realize is </v>
<v Speaker 2>socialism actually equals a two tiered </v>

2865
01:54:18.501 --> 01:54:19.334
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why so many people who are </v>

2866
01:54:21.081 --> 01:54:23.930
<v Speaker 2>wealthy will will be fine with obamacare</v>
<v Speaker 2>or socialism.</v>

2867
01:54:23.931 --> 01:54:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Is it because they're not gonna use it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not using it.</v>

2868
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:28.130
<v Speaker 2>I see him Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2869
01:54:28.131 --> 01:54:29.330
<v Speaker 2>Where we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in Manhattan,</v>

2870
01:54:29.331 --> 01:54:30.164
<v Speaker 2>it's already happening because of how </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York state works and how bad the </v>

2871
01:54:32.451 --> 01:54:33.284
<v Speaker 2>system is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have less and less options for </v>

2872
01:54:34.851 --> 01:54:35.684
<v Speaker 2>insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And only like one or two insurers and I </v>

2873
01:54:36.471 --> 01:54:38.020
<v Speaker 2>left the New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they leave and they're walking away with</v>

2874
01:54:38.030 --> 01:54:38.870
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't make any money.</v>

2875
01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:42.620
<v Speaker 2>So what's happening now is all the best </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors shouldn't say all,</v>

2876
01:54:42.710 --> 01:54:44.960
<v Speaker 2>most of the best doctors don't take </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance anymore.</v>

2877
01:54:45.650 --> 01:54:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>

2878
01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:48.200
<v Speaker 2>They just don't think it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

2879
01:54:48.230 --> 01:54:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you have to do,</v>

2880
01:54:49.851 --> 01:54:53.060
<v Speaker 2>just doctors have enough patients that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are wealthy,</v>

2881
01:54:53.061 --> 01:54:55.010
<v Speaker 2>that want the best medical care there </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go,</v>

2882
01:54:55.011 --> 01:54:56.300
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to pay me.</v>

2883
01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:57.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2884
01:54:57.090 --> 01:54:58.430
<v Speaker 2>and it's actually a better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2885
01:54:58.431 --> 01:54:59.450
<v Speaker 2>cause in my own family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2886
01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:01.520
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a business owner,</v>

2887
01:55:01.521 --> 01:55:03.410
<v Speaker 2>so I have to pay for my own obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2888
01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.273
<v Speaker 2>But my wife phone going obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my wife takes private doctors and I </v>

2889
01:55:08.541 --> 01:55:11.390
<v Speaker 2>take obamacare doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I spoke to my actual family.</v>

2890
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:15.110
<v Speaker 2>So when we go to a doctor's office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see a difference,</v>

2891
01:55:15.111 --> 01:55:15.944
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it's,</v>

2892
01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:20.750
<v Speaker 2>if a doctor takes insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two doctorates in a doctor's office,</v>

2893
01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:21.913
<v Speaker 2>five people who are administrators and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they care more about photocopying your </v>

2894
01:55:27.891 --> 01:55:29.210
<v Speaker 2>documents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you,</v>

2895
01:55:29.870 --> 01:55:31.430
<v Speaker 2>you're in the way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2896
01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.080
<v Speaker 2>the rooms bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one cares.</v>

2897
01:55:33.081 --> 01:55:34.610
<v Speaker 2>Whatever your appointment's at two </v>
<v Speaker 2>o'clock,</v>

2898
01:55:34.760 --> 01:55:38.300
<v Speaker 2>you can see that three 45 now change it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's a doctor who does,</v>

2899
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:39.163
<v Speaker 2>who does not take insurance when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>five doctors and that office two </v>

2900
01:55:41.181 --> 01:55:42.830
<v Speaker 2>administrators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you show up to that,</v>

2901
01:55:42.831 --> 01:55:43.470
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how are you?</v>

2902
01:55:43.470 --> 01:55:45.000
<v Speaker 2>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please have a seat.</v>

2903
01:55:45.001 --> 01:55:45.834
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take your credit card or your </v>

2904
01:55:46.831 --> 01:55:47.551
<v Speaker 2>check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2905
01:55:47.551 --> 01:55:48.540
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're good to go.</v>

2906
01:55:48.570 --> 01:55:50.490
<v Speaker 2>You want me to two o'clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent two oh five.</v>

2907
01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.060
<v Speaker 2>While the comparison of valid comparison</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the Canada's healthcare system versus</v>

2908
01:55:54.061 --> 01:55:54.894
<v Speaker 2>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have friends from Canada to come to </v>

2909
01:55:56.611 --> 01:56:00.840
<v Speaker 2>America to get healthcare because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare system over there,</v>

2910
01:56:00.841 --> 01:56:02.640
<v Speaker 2>although it's free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as good.</v>

2911
01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:03.503
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many aspects and the waiting lists are </v>

2912
01:56:04.711 --> 01:56:06.780
<v Speaker 2>massive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the wealthy come someplace else.</v>

2913
01:56:06.781 --> 01:56:07.680
<v Speaker 2>A two tiered system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2914
01:56:07.681 --> 01:56:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2915
01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:09.133
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live out of a thing now where you </v>

2916
01:56:10.630 --> 01:56:12.480
<v Speaker 2>go go on vacation and get your uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

2917
01:56:12.481 --> 01:56:13.770
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your stuff done right.</v>

2918
01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll get my case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2919
01:56:15.321 --> 01:56:16.081
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's horrible,</v>

2920
01:56:16.081 --> 01:56:18.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let me finish the last piece in the,</v>

2921
01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:20.040
<v Speaker 2>if you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2922
01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.080
<v Speaker 2>an insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the author takes insurance,</v>

2923
01:56:22.410 --> 01:56:24.210
<v Speaker 2>he'll talk to you for maybe five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

2924
01:56:24.211 --> 01:56:25.044
<v Speaker 2>15 minutes at most,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it will always end with one or two </v>

2925
01:56:26.881 --> 01:56:29.170
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prescription or procedure.</v>

2926
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:31.710
<v Speaker 2>It's how they get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bill Medicare,</v>

2927
01:56:32.130 --> 01:56:33.180
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They build Medicaid,</v>

2928
01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:36.060
<v Speaker 2>they bill your insurance company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescription or procedure.</v>

2929
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:38.970
<v Speaker 2>They always doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't make money private.</v>

2930
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:40.950
<v Speaker 2>The person talks for 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes.</v>

2931
01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Ask you things that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how are you eating?</v>

2932
01:56:42.871 --> 01:56:44.850
<v Speaker 2>How are you sleeping?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your stress level?</v>

2933
01:56:45.030 --> 01:56:47.880
<v Speaker 2>Things actually matter when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your health.</v>

2934
01:56:47.881 --> 01:56:50.070
<v Speaker 2>They asked those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

2935
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:52.320
<v Speaker 2>One of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they begin to ask these questions to see</v>

2936
01:56:52.321 --> 01:56:54.270
<v Speaker 2>if it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it doesn't always end with that.</v>

2937
01:56:54.271 --> 01:56:55.104
<v Speaker 2>It ends with whatever's appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're writing them a check </v>

2938
01:56:56.671 --> 01:56:57.480
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2939
01:56:57.480 --> 01:56:59.070
<v Speaker 2>They're getting a 300 bucks for one </v>
<v Speaker 2>visit,</v>

2940
01:56:59.100 --> 01:56:59.933
<v Speaker 2>no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You write him a check where you swipe </v>

2941
01:57:00.541 --> 01:57:01.374
<v Speaker 2>your credit card and there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive for you to talk about what a </v>

2942
01:57:03.661 --> 01:57:05.070
<v Speaker 2>good doctor they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So correct.</v>

2943
01:57:05.150 --> 01:57:07.200
<v Speaker 2>More business that pays them the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you're paying.</v>

2944
01:57:07.200 --> 01:57:08.033
<v Speaker 2>That is exactly correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they don't have to go through </v>

2945
01:57:09.570 --> 01:57:11.040
<v Speaker 2>paperwork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are the customer,</v>

2946
01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:12.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2947
01:57:12.091 --> 01:57:14.520
<v Speaker 2>When it comes to anyone takes insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the insurance companies,</v>

2948
01:57:14.521 --> 01:57:15.354
<v Speaker 2>the customer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no people that are listening to this </v>

2949
01:57:17.281 --> 01:57:19.710
<v Speaker 2>that don't have enough money to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are saying,</v>

2950
01:57:19.711 --> 01:57:24.090
<v Speaker 2>well I want that kind of care and I I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be federally funded.</v>

2951
01:57:24.150 --> 01:57:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>

2952
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:28.160
<v Speaker 2>The combination?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2953
01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:29.910
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you get good care?</v>

2954
01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do I know this?</v>

2955
01:57:31.110 --> 01:57:31.943
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything I'm saying is based on </v>

2956
01:57:33.181 --> 01:57:33.960
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2957
01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:34.793
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the best example I can give you is </v>

2958
01:57:36.300 --> 01:57:40.820
<v Speaker 2>non nonemergency or non critical care </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like Lasik,</v>

2959
01:57:40.821 --> 01:57:43.920
<v Speaker 2>eye surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like cosmetic dentistry,</v>

2960
01:57:44.130 --> 01:57:45.300
<v Speaker 2>all types of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2961
01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting breast enhancements,</v>

2962
01:57:47.371 --> 01:57:48.840
<v Speaker 2>things of that sort.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any type of enhancement.</v>

2963
01:57:48.841 --> 01:57:49.621
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any of those things.</v>

2964
01:57:49.621 --> 01:57:51.300
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you remember years ago,</v>

2965
01:57:51.320 --> 01:57:52.110
<v Speaker 2>you're as old as I am.</v>

2966
01:57:52.110 --> 01:57:54.420
<v Speaker 2>So you know when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Lasik first came out,</v>

2967
01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:57.270
<v Speaker 2>they should charge you per eye cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so expensive.</v>

2968
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:58.583
<v Speaker 2>It was so expensive as per eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you get both done for less than a </v>

2969
01:58:01.710 --> 01:58:02.620
<v Speaker 2>thousand bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2970
01:58:02.650 --> 01:58:04.140
<v Speaker 2>And I was a couple hundred bucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on where you go.</v>

2971
01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:07.890
<v Speaker 2>So what's happened in every instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>service level's going up,</v>

2972
01:58:08.400 --> 01:58:09.233
<v Speaker 2>price has gone down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology has gone up in every case </v>

2973
01:58:13.170 --> 01:58:14.003
<v Speaker 2>that's happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why don't we follow the same model </v>

2974
01:58:15.691 --> 01:58:18.000
<v Speaker 2>and in this and can it work sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>

2975
01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:20.430
<v Speaker 2>The Oklahoma Surgery Center right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2976
01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:22.110
<v Speaker 2>It's doing it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leading Lady,</v>

2977
01:58:22.230 --> 01:58:24.450
<v Speaker 2>they list other pricing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2978
01:58:24.810 --> 01:58:25.810
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can actually like,</v>

2979
01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:26.581
<v Speaker 2>oh okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can get this.</v>

2980
01:58:26.581 --> 01:58:27.710
<v Speaker 2>I know what the cost is cheaper than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2981
01:58:27.740 --> 01:58:29.370
<v Speaker 2>House outside of insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Correct?</v>

2982
01:58:29.371 --> 01:58:30.270
<v Speaker 2>No assurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2983
01:58:30.450 --> 01:58:32.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a motto popping up in certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>

2984
01:58:32.161 --> 01:58:35.130
<v Speaker 2>Now doctors that are coming out of is an</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oklahoma only that I know of.</v>

2985
01:58:35.160 --> 01:58:37.380
<v Speaker 2>There may be others,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then that one I know of interests,</v>

2986
01:58:37.381 --> 01:58:38.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's,</v>

2987
01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I think it's actually called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Oklahoma Center for surgery or something</v>

2988
01:58:41.741 --> 01:58:42.910
<v Speaker 2>like surgery center or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2989
01:58:43.090 --> 01:58:43.923
<v Speaker 2>And so the ideal situation would be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would be available for people that can </v>

2990
01:58:48.851 --> 01:58:51.520
<v Speaker 2>afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for people that can't afford it,</v>

2991
01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:53.340
<v Speaker 2>there's always going to be catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare.</v>

2992
01:58:53.410 --> 01:58:55.240
<v Speaker 2>You break your leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be taken care of.</v>

2993
01:58:55.300 --> 01:58:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Well here's the hit the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be taken care of.</v>

2994
01:58:57.371 --> 01:58:58.204
<v Speaker 2>There's a bigger issue here and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger issue is we in this country have </v>

2995
01:59:00.881 --> 01:59:04.210
<v Speaker 2>confused healthcare with healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance.</v>

2996
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:05.613
<v Speaker 2>They are two totally separate things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't talk much about healthcare </v>

2997
01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.333
<v Speaker 2>insurance that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We like cam more about the healthcare </v>

2998
01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:12.730
<v Speaker 2>system itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system itself is broken.</v>

2999
01:59:12.731 --> 01:59:14.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a cartel system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3000
01:59:14.291 --> 01:59:15.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's literally a people in a room </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting ready,</v>

3001
01:59:15.970 --> 01:59:17.020
<v Speaker 2>get together and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3002
01:59:17.021 --> 01:59:17.620
<v Speaker 2>what do you think?</v>

3003
01:59:17.620 --> 01:59:19.480
<v Speaker 2>A aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>85 bucks.</v>

3004
01:59:19.481 --> 01:59:20.314
<v Speaker 2>When do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3005
01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:24.140
<v Speaker 2>85 bucks it is for aspirin and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on how much it cost to make it.</v>

3006
01:59:24.141 --> 01:59:25.180
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

3007
01:59:25.330 --> 01:59:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a little bit and stuff like that.</v>

3008
01:59:27.551 --> 01:59:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that little twats name,</v>

3009
01:59:29.591 --> 01:59:31.120
<v Speaker 2>that one up going to jail?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just corralling.</v>

3010
01:59:31.121 --> 01:59:32.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Wu Tang clan album,</v>

3011
01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:35.720
<v Speaker 2>perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacked up the price of some heart,</v>

3012
01:59:35.780 --> 01:59:38.980
<v Speaker 2>some medication in a horrific way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perfect example.</v>

3013
01:59:39.070 --> 01:59:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That of course is an extreme example,</v>

3014
01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:42.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's actually happening.</v>

3015
01:59:42.341 --> 01:59:43.174
<v Speaker 2>If you've ever gone to a hospital or </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to a doctor's office and you see </v>

3016
01:59:44.981 --> 01:59:46.000
<v Speaker 2>the PA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they give you the bill,</v>

3017
01:59:46.030 --> 01:59:47.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aspirin,</v>

3018
01:59:47.110 --> 01:59:50.650
<v Speaker 2>85 bucks in a bed for five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$3,000 right?</v>

3019
01:59:50.710 --> 01:59:51.543
<v Speaker 2>I mean they do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3020
01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:52.393
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3021
01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:53.273
<v Speaker 2>and that's a problem in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons is this right </v>

3022
01:59:55.661 --> 01:59:56.494
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare system is the current </v>

3023
01:59:57.011 --> 01:59:57.844
<v Speaker 2>healthcare system.</v>

3024
01:59:58.180 --> 01:59:59.590
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno.</v>

3036

<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

3038
02:00:20.741 --> 02:00:22.360
<v Speaker 2>new job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how much costs.</v>

3039
02:00:22.540 --> 02:00:24.100
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's perfect.</v>

3040
02:00:24.250 --> 02:00:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much it costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what we're gonna do.</v>

3041
02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:26.851
<v Speaker 2>You go home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take,</v>

<v Speaker 2>take the close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great for you.</v>

3043
02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.430
<v Speaker 2>You can get a bill in the mail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a week or so,</v>

3044
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:32.830
<v Speaker 2>whatever the bill is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is you have to pay.</v>

3045
02:00:33.850 --> 02:00:36.100
<v Speaker 2>That's our current healthcare system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3046
02:00:36.130 --> 02:00:37.060
<v Speaker 2>That is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3047
02:00:37.061 --> 02:00:38.320
<v Speaker 2>That's how it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's true.</v>

3048
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:39.630
<v Speaker 2>It's only in our system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3049
02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:42.670
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that for a car or clothes </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a computer thing.</v>

3050
02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.570
<v Speaker 2>Nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only that it's true.</v>

3051
02:00:44.620 --> 02:00:45.760
<v Speaker 2>But here's the worst part.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

3052
02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:47.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decided you want to buy this water </v>

3053
02:00:48.041 --> 02:00:49.360
<v Speaker 2>from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3054
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:51.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry I missed your name.</v>

3055
02:00:51.550 --> 02:00:53.770
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie decides he wants to buy this water</v>

3056
02:00:53.771 --> 02:00:54.581
<v Speaker 2>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm calm young.</v>

3057
02:00:54.581 --> 02:00:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Jeremy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to be a young Jamie Young,</v>

3058
02:00:56.411 --> 02:00:57.244
<v Speaker 2>give him what he wants to buy this water</v>
<v Speaker 2>from you and you agree you want to sell </v>

3059
02:00:58.631 --> 02:01:01.660
<v Speaker 2>to them for a dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He agrees with them by $4 I step in,</v>

3060
02:01:01.690 --> 02:01:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

3061
02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:04.053
<v Speaker 2>you cannot have this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have deemed as the insurance company </v>

3062
02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:08.560
<v Speaker 2>at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This actually is worth 50 cents.</v>

3063
02:01:09.070 --> 02:01:09.903
<v Speaker 2>I've decided so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I give him the water so I can try to </v>

3064
02:01:12.551 --> 02:01:13.810
<v Speaker 2>sell the water for a dollar.</v>

3065
02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Insurance Company says fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>

3066
02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:18.250
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And gives you this sense done.</v>

3067
02:01:18.490 --> 02:01:20.320
<v Speaker 2>That's a real problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3068
02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.060
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So up the next piece though,</v>

3069
02:01:22.061 --> 02:01:24.460
<v Speaker 2>now this guy here and he wants to buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>the water too.</v>

3070
02:01:24.760 --> 02:01:27.400
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't get involved.</v>

3071
02:01:27.700 --> 02:01:28.533
<v Speaker 2>Will you want to sell the water to them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much you wanna sell a word to him </v>

3072
02:01:30.191 --> 02:01:34.480
<v Speaker 2>now a buck 50 now you gotta make up for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the sense of him.</v>

3073
02:01:35.500 --> 02:01:37.660
<v Speaker 2>So he's paying three times as much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's paying.</v>

3074
02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 2>How do you fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the current system.</v>

3075
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:41.900
<v Speaker 2>How would you fix that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Transparency.</v>

3076
02:01:41.901 --> 02:01:43.940
<v Speaker 2>Transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transparency.</v>

3077
02:01:43.970 --> 02:01:46.550
<v Speaker 2>So number one thing trans parents </v>
<v Speaker 2>offers,</v>

3078
02:01:46.610 --> 02:01:49.760
<v Speaker 2>you broke your foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say a broken foot costs this,</v>

3079
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:55.030
<v Speaker 2>it costs $50 an hour for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It costs 15 cents per pill for this.</v>

3080
02:01:55.730 --> 02:01:57.080
<v Speaker 2>That kind of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3081
02:01:57.081 --> 02:01:59.030
<v Speaker 2>But just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just doing one thing.</v>

3082
02:01:59.300 --> 02:02:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Just saying in New York state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just saying this,</v>

3083
02:02:02.270 --> 02:02:06.290
<v Speaker 2>if you sell medical services like any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other service,</v>

3084
02:02:06.710 --> 02:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>you must be transparent.</v>

3085
02:02:08.570 --> 02:02:09.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3086
02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:11.300
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can't just give someone a bill,</v>

3087
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:12.163
<v Speaker 2>you have to show them why it costs what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it costs and you have to have a </v>

3088
02:02:14.691 --> 02:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely charged them for,</v>

3089
02:02:17.031 --> 02:02:18.800
<v Speaker 2>that's very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a car,</v>

3090
02:02:18.801 --> 02:02:19.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't always know much.</v>

3091
02:02:19.661 --> 02:02:20.494
<v Speaker 2>It costs to fix the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They give an estimate so you feel like </v>

3092
02:02:22.671 --> 02:02:23.504
<v Speaker 2>it gives you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the estimate was just been in place for </v>

3093
02:02:24.651 --> 02:02:28.400
<v Speaker 2>a long time and they've taken advantage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it and they have power and so they're</v>

3094
02:02:28.401 --> 02:02:29.234
<v Speaker 2>just leaving it the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's also a bunch of fear and then </v>

3095
02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:33.290
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't enough,</v>

3096
02:02:33.291 --> 02:02:34.124
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This concept of transparency is not </v>

3097
02:02:34.911 --> 02:02:37.970
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these problems that we have,</v>

3098
02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:38.930
<v Speaker 2>people often say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well why?</v>

3099
02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:41.090
<v Speaker 2>What's the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not one thing.</v>

3100
02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:43.820
<v Speaker 2>It's many things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Transparency is a huge piece,</v>

3101
02:02:44.090 --> 02:02:45.770
<v Speaker 2>but you also have to facilitate more </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3102
02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:48.350
<v Speaker 2>As an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to facilitate an environment to</v>

3103
02:02:48.351 --> 02:02:51.110
<v Speaker 2>where if a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3104
02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:52.453
<v Speaker 2>the current system people are starting </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use now is what I call the costco </v>

3105
02:02:54.531 --> 02:02:56.060
<v Speaker 2>model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which basically a membership model,</v>

3106
02:02:56.061 --> 02:02:56.894
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the doctor's office has all of us as </v>

3107
02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:00.613
<v Speaker 2>customers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us decided to pay or they agree </v>

3108
02:03:02.481 --> 02:03:06.020
<v Speaker 2>with what the payment is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 bucks a month or you have a kid,</v>

3109
02:03:06.021 --> 02:03:07.810
<v Speaker 2>so you're 800 bucks a month or your </v>
<v Speaker 2>singles,</v>

3110
02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:08.700
<v Speaker 2>you're turning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the price,</v>

3111
02:03:08.701 --> 02:03:09.534
<v Speaker 2>whatever the price we all pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We now can go to that doctor's office </v>

3112
02:03:12.080 --> 02:03:14.210
<v Speaker 2>whenever need to and whoever's in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

3113
02:03:14.211 --> 02:03:17.630
<v Speaker 2>whatever they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have access to it costs five bucks,</v>

3114
02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:18.950
<v Speaker 2>five bucks over it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

3115
02:03:19.190 --> 02:03:21.710
<v Speaker 2>They try this at zero just doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

3116
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:23.270
<v Speaker 2>But senior citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we show up every day,</v>

3117
02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:26.640
<v Speaker 2>so they charged us that $5 five bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shopify,</v>

3118
02:03:26.670 --> 02:03:27.550
<v Speaker 2>bucks and tomato.</v>

3119
02:03:28.010 --> 02:03:31.070
<v Speaker 2>What's the goal of the doctor's office?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goal of the doctors' offices,</v>

3120
02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:33.050
<v Speaker 2>if you to be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't have a show up,</v>

3121
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:36.050
<v Speaker 2>just pay you 400 bucks every month and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to never show up,</v>

3122
02:03:36.051 --> 02:03:37.010
<v Speaker 2>that'd be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3123
02:03:37.210 --> 02:03:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that's happening already,</v>

3124
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:40.550
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The advantage is whatever they have,</v>

3125
02:03:40.551 --> 02:03:42.710
<v Speaker 2>we get to use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they start making more money,</v>

3126
02:03:42.770 --> 02:03:43.603
<v Speaker 2>they will bring them more doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will bring them more everything so </v>

3127
02:03:45.171 --> 02:03:46.004
<v Speaker 2>that you will get more of your family </v>
<v Speaker 2>and friends to come and pay the monthly </v>

3128
02:03:47.331 --> 02:03:48.860
<v Speaker 2>fee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a gym membership.</v>

3129
02:03:48.861 --> 02:03:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3130
02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:50.780
<v Speaker 2>As long as healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fine.</v>

3131
02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:52.033
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened is as long as they can </v>

3132
02:03:53.031 --> 02:03:54.530
<v Speaker 2>help you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they help you.</v>

3133
02:03:54.650 --> 02:03:55.880
<v Speaker 2>If they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>

3134
02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:56.773
<v Speaker 2>You have catastrophic insurance and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have some type of agreement with </v>

3135
02:04:00.321 --> 02:04:01.154
<v Speaker 2>another facility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hospital or something like that </v>

3136
02:04:02.690 --> 02:04:04.790
<v Speaker 2>so that they will get a lower price </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're going to them,</v>

3137
02:04:04.791 --> 02:04:05.960
<v Speaker 2>they're sending patients to you.</v>

3138
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.823
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you had a bigger issue they can </v>

3139
02:04:07.611 --> 02:04:08.444
<v Speaker 2>handle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to groom with other </v>

3140
02:04:09.021 --> 02:04:10.850
<v Speaker 2>facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get a little price anyway,</v>

3141
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:12.890
<v Speaker 2>but you'd have insurance for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic insurance.</v>

3142
02:04:12.891 --> 02:04:13.724
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already have sunlight that we have </v>

3143
02:04:14.991 --> 02:04:16.040
<v Speaker 2>longterm care insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3144
02:04:16.041 --> 02:04:19.550
<v Speaker 2>Which insurance that when you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that will last a long time,</v>

3145
02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:22.070
<v Speaker 2>there are insurances that will help to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay along.</v>

3146
02:04:22.071 --> 02:04:24.200
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more importantly than that,</v>

3147
02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:26.660
<v Speaker 2>with that in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've take care of are,</v>

3148
02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:27.550
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

3149
02:04:27.550 --> 02:04:30.530
<v Speaker 2>are people who are very poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what can we do?</v>

3150
02:04:30.650 --> 02:04:31.483
<v Speaker 2>We can have a system to where you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>take insurance normally if you want to </v>

3151
02:04:34.100 --> 02:04:37.010
<v Speaker 2>or this system and his an incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you decide,</v>

3152
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:39.390
<v Speaker 2>say as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm making this up as an example,</v>

3153
02:04:39.391 --> 02:04:41.400
<v Speaker 2>only you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10% of your,</v>

3154
02:04:41.490 --> 02:04:42.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your,</v>

3155
02:04:42.311 --> 02:04:43.144
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3156
02:04:43.330 --> 02:04:45.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will bring on for free.</v>

3157
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:48.150
<v Speaker 2>And based upon how we decide that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're poor,</v>

3158
02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:50.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm making this up as an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3159
02:04:50.401 --> 02:04:51.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3160
02:04:51.450 --> 02:04:52.261
<v Speaker 2>they uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3161
02:04:52.261 --> 02:04:53.094
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are eligible for free school lunch </v>

3162
02:04:54.151 --> 02:04:54.984
<v Speaker 2>in New York state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how we as New York state will </v>

3163
02:04:56.401 --> 02:04:59.190
<v Speaker 2>define poor for the sake of argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sake of argument.</v>

3164
02:04:59.490 --> 02:05:00.323
<v Speaker 2>If Algebra that you take those people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we will give you a break on this </v>

3165
02:05:02.971 --> 02:05:05.520
<v Speaker 2>tax or this fee or this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do this,</v>

3166
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:08.970
<v Speaker 2>many of the smaller doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the break probably won't be enough.</v>

3167
02:05:08.971 --> 02:05:12.270
<v Speaker 2>And they probably won't take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but large organizations probably will.</v>

3168
02:05:12.480 --> 02:05:16.290
<v Speaker 2>So larger companies will take on people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who can't afford to pay anything.</v>

3169
02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:20.430
<v Speaker 2>This is another idea or concept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start making this happen.</v>

3170
02:05:20.431 --> 02:05:21.264
<v Speaker 2>If facility in this and you will see </v>
<v Speaker 2>health care will get cheaper and when </v>

3171
02:05:24.421 --> 02:05:28.260
<v Speaker 2>health care gets cheaper now insurance </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets cheaper.</v>

3172
02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Now you have more people want to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into insurance business,</v>

3173
02:05:31.420 --> 02:05:33.240
<v Speaker 2>you will have more options and choices </v>
<v Speaker 2>for insurance.</v>

3174
02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:35.370
<v Speaker 2>You know that people would just get </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergency room insurance.</v>

3175
02:05:35.550 --> 02:05:37.260
<v Speaker 2>Some people just get longterm care </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance,</v>

3176
02:05:37.261 --> 02:05:38.430
<v Speaker 2>so maybe we'll just get x,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y,</v>

3177
02:05:38.460 --> 02:05:41.070
<v Speaker 2>z insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could you reduce the number,</v>

3178
02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:42.233
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money rather than </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical drugs cost cause that </v>

3179
02:05:44.431 --> 02:05:45.480
<v Speaker 2>would be a big issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3180
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:46.740
<v Speaker 2>It would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3181
02:05:46.741 --> 02:05:49.110
<v Speaker 2>Now there are several things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of course is the FDA.</v>

3182
02:05:49.740 --> 02:05:50.573
<v Speaker 2>The FDA stifles so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean at the end to be completely </v>

3183
02:05:52.771 --> 02:05:53.604
<v Speaker 2>rebooted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't really do that in New York </v>

3184
02:05:54.001 --> 02:05:54.890
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

3185
02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:55.743
<v Speaker 2>The government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state government we can't do much </v>

3186
02:05:56.851 --> 02:05:57.684
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All I can do is make it forced them to </v>

3187
02:05:58.861 --> 02:06:00.630
<v Speaker 2>be transparent so that people see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad it is.</v>

3188
02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:03.150
<v Speaker 2>As a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this isn't a hundred percent rule,</v>

3189
02:06:03.151 --> 02:06:06.210
<v Speaker 2>but general rule is when you shine a </v>
<v Speaker 2>light on bad behavior,</v>

3190
02:06:06.510 --> 02:06:07.343
<v Speaker 2>almost though what you can make the bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>behavior less so when it has to be </v>

3191
02:06:09.721 --> 02:06:10.554
<v Speaker 2>transparent and when you actually see </v>
<v Speaker 2>each pill costs all this money and </v>

3192
02:06:13.461 --> 02:06:14.790
<v Speaker 2>enough people go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3193
02:06:14.791 --> 02:06:16.590
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing right enough?</v>

3194
02:06:16.590 --> 02:06:17.670
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you doing?</v>

3195
02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing this and it will force </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to change,</v>

3196
02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 2>but that's a longterm solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is really a federal issue.</v>

3197
02:06:25.380 --> 02:06:25.831
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

3198
02:06:25.831 --> 02:06:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got some really good ideas.</v>

3199
02:06:27.841 --> 02:06:30.230
<v Speaker 2>They're very revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a bold motherfuckers.</v>

3200
02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:31.470
<v Speaker 2>The goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some chances.</v>

3201
02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:32.453
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the fact that you're sticking </v>

3202
02:06:34.441 --> 02:06:37.470
<v Speaker 2>your neck out there with a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and I hope we do well.</v>

3203
02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Let me wrap the last piece he's do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>

3204
02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:41.370
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't win,</v>

3205
02:06:41.640 --> 02:06:43.590
<v Speaker 2>if you don't win,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I win,</v>

3206
02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:47.430
<v Speaker 2>it changed this nation overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100% because all the ideas pop up,</v>

3207
02:06:47.431 --> 02:06:49.800
<v Speaker 2>things will change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will see people who are independent.</v>

3208
02:06:49.950 --> 02:06:50.783
<v Speaker 2>Step Up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see libertarians change to be in </v>

3209
02:06:53.191 --> 02:06:55.260
<v Speaker 2>the debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just be popular.</v>

3210
02:06:55.590 --> 02:06:56.423
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3211
02:06:56.460 --> 02:06:59.670
<v Speaker 2>How much do you have to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably what has to be decided and they</v>

3212
02:06:59.671 --> 02:07:01.290
<v Speaker 2>just decide who designs.</v>

3213
02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:02.153
<v Speaker 2>Is there a committee?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think presidential thing is cuomo </v>

3214
02:07:05.401 --> 02:07:08.250
<v Speaker 2>decides if he wants to show up or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3215
02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:09.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when he does is he says,</v>

3216
02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:12.750
<v Speaker 2>follow my rules and I'll show up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does his rules,</v>

3217
02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:14.370
<v Speaker 2>whatever he feels it's appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

3218
02:07:14.371 --> 02:07:15.210
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him To do that.</v>

3219
02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:15.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3220
02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:18.870
<v Speaker 2>he won't show he did with Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said it has to be sit down,</v>

3221
02:07:18.871 --> 02:07:19.970
<v Speaker 2>must be here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>must be there.</v>

3222
02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:20.940
<v Speaker 2>She said yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he showed up.</v>

3223
02:07:21.330 --> 02:07:24.330
<v Speaker 2>So he'll have his rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say yes and I'll show up.</v>

3224
02:07:25.050 --> 02:07:27.290
<v Speaker 2>What will he do that with you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3225
02:07:27.660 --> 02:07:31.080
<v Speaker 2>I think he will in the last three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last two times he did it.</v>

3226
02:07:31.081 --> 02:07:34.080
<v Speaker 2>He did all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All four people showed up last.</v>

3227
02:07:34.081 --> 02:07:34.914
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for him.</v>

3228
02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last time we did it.</v>

3229
02:07:36.071 --> 02:07:36.791
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So probably,</v>

3230
02:07:36.791 --> 02:07:38.470
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when would this possibly happen?</v>

3231
02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:40.000
<v Speaker 2>October.</v>
<v Speaker 2>October?</v>

3232
02:07:40.001 --> 02:07:42.400
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we could promote that.</v>

3233
02:07:42.450 --> 02:07:44.250
<v Speaker 2>We can tell people about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

3234
02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:45.383
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would be the key things that you </v>

3235
02:07:47.801 --> 02:07:50.620
<v Speaker 2>and him would butt heads on?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3236
02:07:50.621 --> 02:07:52.010
<v Speaker 2>So much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3237
02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:53.950
<v Speaker 2>as a general rule,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest thing is,</v>

3238
02:07:54.190 --> 02:07:56.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the states collapsing and he doesn't say</v>

3239
02:07:56.201 --> 02:07:57.034
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says the states awesome because we </v>

3240
02:07:59.111 --> 02:08:01.480
<v Speaker 2>have great gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what he says.</v>

3241
02:08:02.170 --> 02:08:03.003
<v Speaker 2>He's worried about fighting trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He thinks fighting trump has everything </v>

3242
02:08:04.781 --> 02:08:06.940
<v Speaker 2>because he's running for president 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 a.</v>

3243
02:08:06.941 --> 02:08:10.990
<v Speaker 2>So his entire campaign is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one who can beat trump.</v>

3244
02:08:11.590 --> 02:08:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm the only one who can protect New </v>
<v Speaker 2>York state from trump.</v>

3245
02:08:13.690 --> 02:08:17.350
<v Speaker 2>And if he loses the governorship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's fucked.</v>

3246
02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Running for president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3247
02:08:19.260 --> 02:08:20.890
<v Speaker 2>It depends on Democrats think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3248
02:08:20.891 --> 02:08:21.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it depends.</v>

3249
02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Some Democrats who depends on who wants </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight trump in 2020.</v>

3250
02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:25.773
<v Speaker 2>If trump is very popular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of Democrats won't want to fight </v>

3251
02:08:28.421 --> 02:08:29.290
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Como,</v>

3252
02:08:29.291 --> 02:08:30.880
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who else is going to run?</v>

3253
02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.590
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For my twenties,</v>

3254
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:34.990
<v Speaker 2>as a democrat?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is Hillary running again?</v>

3255
02:08:35.050 --> 02:08:36.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like she is right.</v>

3256
02:08:36.970 --> 02:08:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it seems like Bernie might run </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

3257
02:08:39.100 --> 02:08:40.150
<v Speaker 2>He might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3258
02:08:40.290 --> 02:08:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of Mites,</v>

3259
02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:43.780
<v Speaker 2>so I don't really know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It hit his loss.</v>

3260
02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Might mean that he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3261
02:08:45.970 --> 02:08:49.420
<v Speaker 2>that he doesn't run vote if you win </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes the entire nation,</v>

3262
02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:50.673
<v Speaker 2>not just that you will find people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are liberty leaning all of a sudden </v>

3263
02:08:53.021 --> 02:08:54.920
<v Speaker 2>running the libertarian banner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm,</v>

3264
02:08:54.970 --> 02:08:55.803
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm right now the most popular guy </v>

3265
02:08:57.701 --> 02:08:58.534
<v Speaker 2>running who has an l buys name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are some libertarians who are </v>

3266
02:09:00.161 --> 02:09:01.150
<v Speaker 2>running who don't have els by their </v>
<v Speaker 2>name.</v>

3267
02:09:01.240 --> 02:09:02.073
<v Speaker 2>They're running a nonpartisan racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm running boldly with an elbow by my </v>

3268
02:09:04.271 --> 02:09:04.901
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3269
02:09:04.901 --> 02:09:07.090
<v Speaker 2>So I'm trying to change the brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a decent brand.</v>

3270
02:09:07.091 --> 02:09:07.924
<v Speaker 2>It's what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you putting the betraying all my </v>

3271
02:09:08.711 --> 02:09:09.190
<v Speaker 2>stuff?</v>

3272
02:09:09.190 --> 02:09:10.023
<v Speaker 2>I'm always libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm trying to build the brand out to </v>

3273
02:09:13.001 --> 02:09:13.834
<v Speaker 2>be a better brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I win the brands better people </v>

3274
02:09:17.081 --> 02:09:18.310
<v Speaker 2>would do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will raise my money,</v>

3275
02:09:18.460 --> 02:09:19.750
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a real third party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3276
02:09:19.751 --> 02:09:21.370
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a third party in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

3277
02:09:21.371 --> 02:09:22.204
<v Speaker 2>which will make better democrats and </v>
<v Speaker 2>better republicans will literally be a </v>

3278
02:09:24.161 --> 02:09:25.450
<v Speaker 2>better nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a better pr.</v>

3279
02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:29.920
<v Speaker 2>A politic will be better in in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>if I actually win this damn thing.</v>

3280
02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:31.353
<v Speaker 2>But let's say I lose Sam wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My things in my mind is a wrong </v>

3281
02:09:33.281 --> 02:09:34.011
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want gray,</v>

3282
02:09:34.011 --> 02:09:35.710
<v Speaker 2>I lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter.</v>

3283
02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:39.610
<v Speaker 2>The bold ideas are still out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you heard,</v>

3284
02:09:39.611 --> 02:09:43.180
<v Speaker 2>what your audience hurt is still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's going to pick this up,</v>

3285
02:09:43.181 --> 02:09:45.610
<v Speaker 2>some of us in a talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're fine with that,</v>

3286
02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:48.220
<v Speaker 2>100% what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3287
02:09:48.221 --> 02:09:49.054
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to fix things I'm not concerned </v>

3288
02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:53.170
<v Speaker 2>with who gets the credit for it.</v>

3289
02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Let's fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a better place to live.</v>

3290
02:09:56.140 --> 02:09:56.973
<v Speaker 2>This cutters in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neil's gets a perfect example of where </v>

3291
02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:01.090
<v Speaker 2>we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that to be the rest of this</v>

3292
02:10:01.091 --> 02:10:02.590
<v Speaker 2>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can fix,</v>

3293
02:10:02.650 --> 02:10:05.290
<v Speaker 2>steal all my stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please steal it all.</v>

3294
02:10:05.350 --> 02:10:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope you steal it.</v>

3295
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:09.610
<v Speaker 2>I hope California copies me and does </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything I said it'd be amazing.</v>

3296
02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Please do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be awesome,</v>

3297
02:10:11.260 --> 02:10:13.900
<v Speaker 2>but if people don't hear me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I don't get out there,</v>

3298
02:10:13.901 --> 02:10:16.270
<v Speaker 2>if I don't get debate stage and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in second or third,</v>

3299
02:10:16.570 --> 02:10:18.520
<v Speaker 2>then no one's going to hear me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be forgotten.</v>

3300
02:10:19.030 --> 02:10:21.040
<v Speaker 2>But if I come in second or a tight </v>
<v Speaker 2>third,</v>

3301
02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:21.993
<v Speaker 2>there'll be a microphone in my face for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the next two years and every time it's </v>

3302
02:10:24.461 --> 02:10:27.550
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be saying stuff just like this again</v>

3303
02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:28.533
<v Speaker 2>and again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe my education system isn't </v>

3304
02:10:30.781 --> 02:10:32.050
<v Speaker 2>perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but guess what?</v>

3305
02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Someone will figure out the right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't be.</v>

3306
02:10:33.831 --> 02:10:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Just keep giving it money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It won't be that.</v>

3307
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:40.580
<v Speaker 2>It'll be something I'll actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be something brand new and exciting</v>

3308
02:10:40.730 --> 02:10:42.170
<v Speaker 2>and get people to come back to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

3309
02:10:42.380 --> 02:10:45.500
<v Speaker 2>What I don't want is what's happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>now is kids get educated,</v>

3310
02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:46.513
<v Speaker 2>they leave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't come back with the edge here </v>

3311
02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:50.570
<v Speaker 2>someplace else and never come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the wrong answer.</v>
