1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And less gay boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Speaker 1>we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alonzo Bowden.</v>

3
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>How are you man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is up,</v>

4
00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Joe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm grateful and somber times.</v>

5
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 1>These are the weirdest fucking times </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

6
00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Rip to Tom Petty A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we have to say that too,</v>

7
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.403
<v Speaker 1>obviously</v>

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 2>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

9
00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 2>and like everyone's been saying again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

10
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here we go again.</v>

11
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Another go again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another mass shooting.</v>

12
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 2>I think the most disturbing graphic to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me was the scorecard.</v>

14
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Like they showed like this guy got 58 </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the guy in Orlando got what?</v>

15
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 2>40 something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so because it's like,</v>

16
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.803
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just encouraged the next cycle to </v>

17
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:50.610
<v Speaker 2>try to set the record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

18
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:51.444
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

19
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.433
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There has to be another way to say it </v>

20
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 2>without giving publicity to he killed </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than anybody else.</v>

21
00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.993
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know.</v>

22
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everybody's listening in the future,</v>

23
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>this is taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're recording this on Tuesday.</v>

24
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.573
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the massacre happened in Las Vegas on </v>

25
00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just a couple of days ago and we</v>

26
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 1>were just going over all the details of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

27
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reading online here,</v>

28
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>he killed 59 people injured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>527,</v>

29
00:01:19.201 --> 00:01:24.201
<v Speaker 1>which is just fucking completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean 527 people shot.</v>

30
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or is that like,</v>

31
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>does that count?</v>
<v Speaker 1>People trampled?</v>

32
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.023
<v Speaker 2>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it includes people trample them injured </v>

33
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 2>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were a hell of a lot of people</v>

34
00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:36.434
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he opened up with automatic </v>

35
00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 2>weapons into a crowd of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to where probably,</v>

36
00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did any bullets hit the ground?</v>

37
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.793
<v Speaker 2>Like there were so many people if this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that every bullet probably hit </v>

38
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:50.234
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably or more than one person </v>

40
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 2>dependent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the power of the ballistics</v>

41
00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 2>of the weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

42
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he definitely,</v>

43
00:01:57.341 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 2>like bullets could have went through one</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy in Texas.</v>

44
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100 percent.</v>

45
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

46
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>everybody's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes a big gun control argument,</v>

48
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.620
<v Speaker 1>which it should be right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

49
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>one thing that we got to really take </v>
<v Speaker 1>into considerations,</v>

50
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.033
<v Speaker 1>he had an illegal guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guns were illegal I think for 25 </v>

51
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.280
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this isn't,</v>

52
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much of this could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been helped by making it more illegal.</v>

53
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

54
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always a debate first.</v>

55
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.413
<v Speaker 2>The first problem is what was going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday when they say this is not the </v>

56
00:02:33.101 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 2>time to talk about guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it is.</v>

57
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.831
<v Speaker 2>And it did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:38.380
<v Speaker 2>of course it's the exact time to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about guns and,</v>

59
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.233
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not a gun guy in the sense that </v>

60
00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.244
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a gun owner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I get it with guys who are into </v>

61
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:45.754
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always compare it to my love of cars </v>

62
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 2>and bikes or anything mechanical or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

63
00:02:50.411 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I understand it but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the people,</v>

64
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.373
<v Speaker 2>most of the people I talked to who loved</v>
<v Speaker 2>guns don't have a problem with like </v>

65
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>registration certainly don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem with education and,</v>

66
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.693
<v Speaker 2>and what I call common sense gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>ownership and that there is some guns </v>

67
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 2>that I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want,</v>

68
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 2>there are some guns that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

69
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm not speaking with any expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but from the layman's point of view,</v>

70
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:14.944
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you need the semiautomatic </v>

71
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 2>military style weapon in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

72
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.710
<v Speaker 2>don't tell me you have it for hunting or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything else.</v>

74
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 2>Like if there's a reason you want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>collect it,</v>

75
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.220
<v Speaker 2>just like if there's a reason you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>to own a race car,</v>

76
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And somebody says,</v>

77
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>why do you need a car that does 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour?</v>

78
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may have a reason you want that race</v>

79
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 2>car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't use it on the street.</v>

80
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:41.040
<v Speaker 2>You can't take it out onto the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I.</v>

81
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.883
<v Speaker 2>and I think that should be that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be some kind of rule with that </v>

82
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 2>kind of weapon that if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

83
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if there's a rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>

84
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.680
<v Speaker 2>there were plenty of rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

85
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.050
<v Speaker 2>that guy violated all the rules that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy did.</v>

86
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just talking about the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>attitude towards sales.</v>

87
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.861
<v Speaker 2>Just the idea that you can walk into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>store and buy these weapons.</v>

88
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It should somehow be more difficult to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

89
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 2>and again this is my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

90
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>but I think it should be more difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>to buy a weapon of that tight.</v>

91
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well these are all illegal weapons.</v>

92
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.530
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy shot,</v>

93
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 2>converted them to fully automatic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fully automatics illegal everywhere.</v>

94
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's fucked up about this guy.</v>

95
00:04:20.721 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 2>This guy didn't have a criminal record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no army training,</v>

96
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 2>no religious or political affiliation </v>
<v Speaker 2>affiliations.</v>

97
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 2>No one has any idea what his motives </v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

98
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 2>He was wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a big time high roller,</v>

99
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 2>which is how he got this giant suite in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas.</v>

100
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is fucking bizarre.</v>

101
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 2>Did you see his brother get interviewed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

102
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

103
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 2>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

104
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

105
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.383
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing about this kind of </v>

106
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 2>insanity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

107
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:47.613
<v Speaker 2>There is usually no outward like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how many people are like this in </v>

108
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:53.990
<v Speaker 2>this country that we don't know about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

109
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.170
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That have as,</v>

110
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 2>and particularly if you're wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're wealthy,</v>

111
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 2>it's so much easier to hide it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Because you may have a big house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may have a compound,</v>

113
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 2>you may have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 2>a camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place you go camping in the woods,</v>

115
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 2>units actually stocked with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 2>a 100 weapons or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that the randomness of this,</v>

117
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.340
<v Speaker 2>to me that is the biggest horror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The worst thing about this to me is just</v>

118
00:05:20.711 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 2>the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you went to a fucking concert,</v>

119
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's all you did.</v>

120
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 2>You went to a concert in Vegas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're never coming home.</v>

121
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Your family's destroyed everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

122
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.213
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the utter randomness of it </v>

123
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 2>that you can't control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

124
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 2>that's what's terrifying about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

125
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.630
<v Speaker 2>which is really strange to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the definition of terrorist.</v>

126
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's calling this guy a terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

127
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.733
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political or religious to be a </v>

128
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 2>terrorist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how the fuck this guy.</v>

129
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Not a terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

130
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:50.733
<v Speaker 2>this is definitely terror.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is definitely terror because you </v>

131
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>know why it's terrible because now are </v>
<v Speaker 2>you going to go to a big event in Vegas?</v>

132
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to go to a big outdoor </v>
<v Speaker 2>con?</v>

133
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:00.944
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vegas does these music festivals in </v>

134
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:03.614
<v Speaker 2>front of these towers and if someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do something like this and the </v>

135
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:07.334
<v Speaker 2>end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pools,</v>

136
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have those giant Edm parties at the</v>

137
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:11.204
<v Speaker 2>pool all summer that are literally </v>
<v Speaker 2>surrounded by the Tower of whatever </v>

138
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:15.704
<v Speaker 2>hotel you're in so next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it's terror because now </v>

139
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 2>you have to be afraid to do that.</v>

140
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.671
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>

141
00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:22.504
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now they're going to have some sort of </v>

142
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:28.660
<v Speaker 3>screening when you go into hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>

143
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.790
<v Speaker 3>why the fuck didn't they have them </v>
<v Speaker 3>already?</v>

144
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 3>How I've always thought this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The airports are so stringent,</v>

145
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 3>like you go through the airports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they check your Dick.</v>

146
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.910
<v Speaker 3>They literally will pat your Dick if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit a random,</v>

147
00:06:39.911 --> 00:06:40.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being.</v>

148
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry sir,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got to check your day,</v>

149
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.680
<v Speaker 3>your random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they literally put the back of their</v>

150
00:06:44.681 --> 00:06:45.514
<v Speaker 3>hand because it was really odd to me </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's okay to touch your Dick with </v>

151
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:53.221
<v Speaker 3>the back of your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The less sensitive they get to smooth it</v>

152
00:06:54.521 --> 00:06:55.600
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

153
00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:58.060
<v Speaker 3>that's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's okay sir.</v>

154
00:06:58.061 --> 00:07:01.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm just using the back of my hand to </v>
<v Speaker 3>touch your Dick like we might have had.</v>

155
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.670
<v Speaker 3>They might've had them grabbing and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy was just like,</v>

156
00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:05.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm not grabbing a hard dick.</v>

157
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.960
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt it was them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They got the union,</v>

158
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.863
<v Speaker 3>the other guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm not getting my dick hard by </v>

159
00:07:10.811 --> 00:07:15.811
<v Speaker 3>some guy who's looking for a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just weird that they can do that.</v>

160
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.910
<v Speaker 3>But if you go through the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

161
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.150
<v Speaker 3>like airports we've decided are places </v>
<v Speaker 3>where terror exists,</v>

162
00:07:22.151 --> 00:07:23.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have like,</v>

163
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.270
<v Speaker 3>like I have Tsa Pre med,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a,</v>

164
00:07:27.271 --> 00:07:28.104
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a global entry and all of that have a </v>

165
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 3>clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clear is the best.</v>

166
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Queer is the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

167
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

168
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.840
<v Speaker 3>What a habit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

169
00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:39.340
<v Speaker 3>You just put your fingers down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

170
00:07:39.341 --> 00:07:40.630
<v Speaker 3>It's got a picture of you go right </v>
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>

171
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.680
<v Speaker 3>It takes two seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

172
00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:42.514
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's just a place where we've </v>

173
00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:46.690
<v Speaker 3>decided you have terror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

174
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.780
<v Speaker 3>And now are we going to decide that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have terror everywhere?</v>

175
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

176
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for one thing,</v>

177
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

178
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.793
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying into the hotel argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a bigger issue here than </v>

179
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.394
<v Speaker 2>the hotels and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the issue is the weapons and what </v>

180
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:05.801
<v Speaker 2>can we do about the proliferation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Proliferation of weapons proliferation.</v>

181
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Proliferation of weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

182
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:10.290
<v Speaker 2>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You started.</v>

183
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.230
<v Speaker 2>Where did you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

184
00:08:11.231 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm too deep into this word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got too deep into a word now.</v>

185
00:08:14.631 --> 00:08:17.300
<v Speaker 2>There's no backing out all the damn </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>

186
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.900
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that.</v>

187
00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 2>But that's the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about hotels though,</v>

188
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.780
<v Speaker 2>and this been in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the privacy issue is huge,</v>

189
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.614
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your hotel room is basically your home </v>

190
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 2>away from home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When do you get what other privacy rules</v>

191
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.390
<v Speaker 2>of checking what you bring into a hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's in your hotel room room?</v>

192
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I remember the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stoplight cameras,</v>

193
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.923
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

194
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.853
<v Speaker 2>And they got sued and people got in </v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble because they got that picture </v>

195
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 2>taken and the wrong person was in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

196
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:46.514
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>

197
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.730
<v Speaker 2>That chick wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his wife dies.</v>

198
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or this guy wasn't his husband.</v>

199
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 2>One guy sued because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the picture was taken.</v>

200
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.250
<v Speaker 2>The woman wasn't his.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They send the ticket</v>

201
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.083
<v Speaker 3>to your house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

202
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 3>He got into A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

203
00:08:58.141 --> 00:08:59.690
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

204
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 3>and he won the suit in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

205
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 3>there's a level of privacy that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>expected in your cost.</v>

206
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand why that it's illegal </v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

207
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 3>because it's a third party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not actually.</v>

208
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Even the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they farmed it off.</v>

209
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:14.833
<v Speaker 3>They say on some other company that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sending you a ticket and charging you </v>

210
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.144
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

211
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 3>And everybody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

212
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:20.244
<v Speaker 3>what do you guys are having your hiring </v>
<v Speaker 3>people to do this commissioning a place </v>

213
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 3>to write tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they had to do.</v>

214
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 3>They had to rename the cameras to only </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit the license plate.</v>

215
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 3>But that's not true because I got one </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other day you got showed you sent me</v>

216
00:09:32.941 --> 00:09:36.170
<v Speaker 3>a picture of me smiling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's not little cocky.</v>

217
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Tried to go right on red flashed me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

218
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.753
<v Speaker 3>But the point being in your hotel room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like there's an expectation of privacy </v>

219
00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 3>and and where is that line drawn?</v>

220
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.283
<v Speaker 3>The other big difference to be drawn in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegas because people get freaky in </v>

221
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:52.494
<v Speaker 3>Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

222
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other big difference,</v>

223
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 3>and I'll tell you a vegas story about </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

224
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 3>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard.</v>

225
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:00.540
<v Speaker 3>But the other big differences when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on an airplane,</v>

226
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 3>your trapped in that airplane when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a hotel like you can run,</v>

227
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can order it on down the stairs.</v>

228
00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:09.780
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really know you,</v>

229
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:10.614
<v Speaker 3>you compared to being in an airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's a valid comparison </v>

230
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 3>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like you're still in a box,</v>

231
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 3>you're in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a confined space.</v>

232
00:10:19.471 --> 00:10:22.930
<v Speaker 3>But I think it's easier to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the thing about about Vegas,</v>

233
00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:23.764
<v Speaker 3>this guy told me who was a security guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said the thing about the cameras is </v>

234
00:10:27.351 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see who's with who?</v>

235
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.443
<v Speaker 3>And then there was one particular guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>that kept singing but he kept bringing </v>

236
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.540
<v Speaker 3>transgender hookers to his room and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they knew who he was.</v>

237
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 3>He was like a famous guy and they were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

238
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.720
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can,</v>

239
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.200
<v Speaker 3>we could destroy this guy if we wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got.</v>

240
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.390
<v Speaker 3>Because they got cameras everywhere in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegas,</v>

241
00:10:45.391 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They know who's coming upstairs room.</v>

242
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:49.240
<v Speaker 3>They know what room they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get.</v>

243
00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Like super obvious transgender ones </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

244
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.433
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the giant football player you guys </v>

245
00:10:56.641 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 3>felt like you dresses on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

246
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

247
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.310
<v Speaker 3>so I had to give up that hobby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

248
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kidding.</v>

249
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing from this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to go out viral.</v>

250
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.423
<v Speaker 3>We knew it.</v>

251
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.523
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's another thing that is a giant </v>

252
00:11:11.641 --> 00:11:13.150
<v Speaker 3>issue that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

253
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 3>haven't heard discussed at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mental health.</v>

254
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.820
<v Speaker 3>And this is really what this is all </v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

255
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:18.713
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this is a gun issue in the sense </v>

256
00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:21.744
<v Speaker 3>that he used guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then is it a truck issue in Nice </v>

257
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 3>France where that guy just drove into </v>
<v Speaker 3>those people?</v>

258
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:27.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it a.</v>

259
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.703
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a ton of different ways to kill </v>

260
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:30.504
<v Speaker 3>people and I'm sure we're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 3>more of these fucked up ways in the </v>

261
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:33.534
<v Speaker 3>future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real issue is a mental health </v>

262
00:11:35.611 --> 00:11:37.790
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this guy,</v>

263
00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 3>his dad was a psychopath.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a serial bank robber.</v>

264
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.450
<v Speaker 3>He spent eight years on the FBI's most </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted list.</v>

265
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.580
<v Speaker 3>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

266
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Like is that genetic?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like does that transfer over?</v>

267
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.090
<v Speaker 3>Like how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

268
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.923
<v Speaker 2>could be genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could be that psychological thing of </v>

269
00:11:58.261 --> 00:12:01.110
<v Speaker 2>I want to outdo my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

270
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 2>this guy could be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

271
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.960
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a millionaire.</v>

272
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.701
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>

273
00:12:04.701 --> 00:12:05.534
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>

274
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.510
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously a high achiever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he could have that whole,</v>

275
00:12:09.511 --> 00:12:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could have that hole where he always</v>

276
00:12:11.611 --> 00:12:15.840
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do something bigger than his </v>
<v Speaker 2>dad or he wanted some approval,</v>

277
00:12:15.841 --> 00:12:19.230
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some weird kind of approval thing.</v>

278
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:20.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's just speculation,</v>

279
00:12:20.971 --> 00:12:21.360
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

280
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you could speculate a,</v>

281
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch our mental health issue,</v>

282
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:30.240
<v Speaker 2>just a health issue in this country that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a show unto itself,</v>

283
00:12:30.241 --> 00:12:31.074
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

284
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.660
<v Speaker 2>we don't take care of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't take care of people.</v>

285
00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 2>We don't provide for the mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mental health problem.</v>

286
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.770
<v Speaker 2>You look downtown in any city in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

287
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.020
<v Speaker 2>wandering the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homeless.</v>

288
00:12:43.021 --> 00:12:47.340
<v Speaker 2>You got schizophrenia and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all kinds of people and you know,</v>

289
00:12:47.341 --> 00:12:49.400
<v Speaker 2>God forbid they got weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

290
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.260
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you talk about the other ways.</v>

291
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there are attacks that we just </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't hear about.</v>

292
00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:56.363
<v Speaker 2>You know where some guy goes nuts with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>knife or a broken bottle and whatever </v>

293
00:13:00.061 --> 00:13:00.680
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>

294
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.513
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the big things that </v>

295
00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:05.280
<v Speaker 1>happens in places that have stricter gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>control and the argument would be that,</v>

296
00:13:05.281 --> 00:13:05.880
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

297
00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.660
<v Speaker 1>that's safer for the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to handle.</v>

298
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:10.503
<v Speaker 1>There's more things that you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some guy with a machine gun going down </v>

299
00:13:14.491 --> 00:13:16.050
<v Speaker 1>all these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

300
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:19.140
<v Speaker 1>gun control's not really gonna help </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

301
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:19.974
<v Speaker 1>this guy was using illegal guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the issue at this point is that </v>

302
00:13:24.481 --> 00:13:28.230
<v Speaker 1>there's so many guns out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even if you made guns illegal,</v>

303
00:13:28.231 --> 00:13:31.050
<v Speaker 1>what are we going to sweep?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to go house to house?</v>

304
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.410
<v Speaker 1>And if we do sweep and go house to </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

305
00:13:34.411 --> 00:13:35.244
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to resist that because </v>

306
00:13:36.811 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 1>for every one of these psychopaths that </v>
<v Speaker 1>winds up shooting people and,</v>

307
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:42.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and gunning someone down,</v>

308
00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.153
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be genuine normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that want a gun to protect their </v>

309
00:13:47.281 --> 00:13:48.114
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they live in a sketchy </v>

310
00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:51.450
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and then all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government comes along and says,</v>

311
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's illegal for you to possess that</v>

312
00:13:53.701 --> 00:13:55.380
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then who has guns?</v>

313
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're already criminals.</v>

314
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.270
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the solution is in between and I</v>

315
00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:02.170
<v Speaker 2>think this is another one where we get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

316
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:05.660
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem we have and I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even say when it started,</v>

317
00:14:05.661 --> 00:14:09.890
<v Speaker 2>when you have the two sides and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>either or so either you know,</v>

318
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:10.733
<v Speaker 2>no gun regulations or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or far too many gun regulations and I </v>

319
00:14:14.601 --> 00:14:16.310
<v Speaker 2>think the solution is somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>

320
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:20.090
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been like why can't we treat</v>

321
00:14:20.091 --> 00:14:22.220
<v Speaker 2>them like cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you buy a car,</v>

322
00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.870
<v Speaker 2>you registered the car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

323
00:14:23.871 --> 00:14:27.140
<v Speaker 2>So the government knows like Joe knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe has this car,</v>

324
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you,</v>

325
00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.103
<v Speaker 2>you have to have insurance in case </v>
<v Speaker 2>something goes wrong with the car and </v>

326
00:14:31.851 --> 00:14:35.300
<v Speaker 2>you hurt somebody and then if you sell </v>
<v Speaker 2>the car to me,</v>

327
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.190
<v Speaker 2>you tell the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

328
00:14:37.191 --> 00:14:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I just sold the car to Alonzo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm no longer liable for this car,</v>

329
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Alonzo's liable for this car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

330
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:48.430
<v Speaker 2>I've always thought that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of common sense gun registration.</v>

331
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:49.900
<v Speaker 2>Well here's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

332
00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Along with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with guns,</v>

333
00:14:50.921 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have to know how to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>them</v>

334
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.820
<v Speaker 2>is where they really fucked up things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

335
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.430
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately</v>

336
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.640
<v Speaker 1>if you drive a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take tests,</v>

337
00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you have to pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand the registration,</v>

338
00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.830
<v Speaker 1>the rules rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to,</v>

339
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to go and a guy has a sit next </v>
<v Speaker 1>to you,</v>

340
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.570
<v Speaker 1>you have to go through a driver's test</v>

341
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 2>and I don't see why we can't do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with guns.</v>

342
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.290
<v Speaker 2>You should absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to go to a range and show,</v>

343
00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:15.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the safety of using a gun and,</v>

344
00:15:15.531 --> 00:15:17.330
<v Speaker 2>and how to shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

345
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:18.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why we can't do that.</v>

346
00:15:18.981 --> 00:15:21.020
<v Speaker 2>And even if your family teaches you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

347
00:15:21.021 --> 00:15:21.854
<v Speaker 2>they say like in a lot of places you </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow up with guns and as a kid your dad </v>

348
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.543
<v Speaker 2>teaches you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

349
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 2>if your dad teaches you to drive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have to go to DMV and take the</v>

350
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:32.060
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like your dad,</v>

351
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:32.894
<v Speaker 2>your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever your uncle could teach you to </v>

352
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:35.600
<v Speaker 2>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you still,</v>

353
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.530
<v Speaker 2>there should be some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some level of testing to,</v>

354
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.710
<v Speaker 2>to get an idea because we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

355
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:42.583
<v Speaker 2>just a couple of weeks ago where you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a four year old in Florida who was </v>

356
00:15:46.401 --> 00:15:47.234
<v Speaker 2>looking in their grandmother's purse for</v>
<v Speaker 2>candy and shot themselves and it's like </v>

357
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:55.010
<v Speaker 2>that grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a safety issue with the gun.</v>

358
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:59.510
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't tell the kid to go get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some candy when you know you have a gun.</v>

359
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.493
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a nutty number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 21 people a year killed in this </v>

360
00:16:03.261 --> 00:16:04.940
<v Speaker 1>country by arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toddlers.</v>

361
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:05.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

362
00:16:05.921 --> 00:16:07.360
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe it.</v>

363
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:08.283
<v Speaker 2>Find out what the number is.</v>

364
00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were shot to death by babies.</v>

365
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any of the other thing is.</v>

366
00:16:13.391 --> 00:16:14.224
<v Speaker 2>And you brought it up like how okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we didn't have guns then they'd be </v>

367
00:16:16.801 --> 00:16:17.450
<v Speaker 2>killing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.940
<v Speaker 2>with knives or clubs or something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just that idea that,</v>

369
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.100
<v Speaker 2>that we have to have that discussion </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

370
00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.293
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what weapon or the mass killer is going </v>

371
00:16:25.201 --> 00:16:27.630
<v Speaker 2>to use?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That in itself is insane.</v>

372
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Just the fact that we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

373
00:16:30.061 --> 00:16:31.660
<v Speaker 2>we're going to have these mass killers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

374
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.170
<v Speaker 2>we gotta have them working with </v>
<v Speaker 2>different weapons.</v>

375
00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:34.981
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

376
00:16:34.981 --> 00:16:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't know on the mental health I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

377
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even going to pretend to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the expertise to talk about what it is,</v>

378
00:16:42.121 --> 00:16:44.280
<v Speaker 2>but it's an issue that we don't spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>money on.</v>

379
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.970
<v Speaker 2>It's an issue not covered by a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>insurance.</v>

380
00:16:47.971 --> 00:16:51.810
<v Speaker 2>A lot of insurance doesn't cover any </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of mental health care.</v>

381
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.723
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it does cover mean a giant </v>

382
00:16:56.581 --> 00:17:00.690
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the people that commit </v>
<v Speaker 1>these giant mass shootings are either on</v>

383
00:17:00.691 --> 00:17:01.524
<v Speaker 1>psychoactive medication or are having </v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawals from psychoactive </v>

384
00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:07.530
<v Speaker 1>medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even if your insurance covers it,</v>

385
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.490
<v Speaker 1>even if you're medicated by a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

386
00:17:11.491 --> 00:17:12.324
<v Speaker 1>there's a disassociative quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently with a lot of these </v>

387
00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:15.774
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants and anti psychotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>medications that people take that with </v>

388
00:17:18.931 --> 00:17:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the right combination of biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

389
00:17:21.661 --> 00:17:22.860
<v Speaker 1>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>

390
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.180
<v Speaker 1>People just can snap and they don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an issue.</v>

391
00:17:27.181 --> 00:17:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

392
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.730
<v Speaker 1>what are the numbers of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that stuff?</v>

393
00:17:29.731 --> 00:17:30.564
<v Speaker 1>A giant number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the numbers of people that </v>

394
00:17:31.891 --> 00:17:34.230
<v Speaker 1>actually wind up and go and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>shootings?</v>

395
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:35.101
<v Speaker 1>Much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

396
00:17:35.101 --> 00:17:35.701
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

397
00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:36.534
<v Speaker 1>much smaller number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's enough that if it happens once </v>

398
00:17:39.421 --> 00:17:42.210
<v Speaker 1>a year like Orlando last year and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year in Vegas,</v>

399
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Fuck Nigga again,</v>

400
00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:48.330
<v Speaker 1>we don't know why this guy did this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have no idea if he was on anything,</v>

401
00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>but what the fuck is</v>

402
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.130
<v Speaker 2>it that we have to do to stop this stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>from happening?</v>

403
00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

404
00:17:54.121 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there were scientists who study</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and all,</v>

405
00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 2>but I can't imagine people that can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can predict it.</v>

406
00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:02.880
<v Speaker 2>People are getting shot by toddlers on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>weekly basis this year.</v>

407
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Trust Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people have killed themselves?</v>

408
00:18:06.451 --> 00:18:07.284
<v Speaker 2>18 more injured themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 injured other people to killed other </v>

409
00:18:10.861 --> 00:18:12.960
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was in 2015</v>

410
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.833
<v Speaker 4>last year.</v>

411
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Toddlers have killed at least shot at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least 23 people this year.</v>

412
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five months.</v>

413
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

414
00:18:26.251 --> 00:18:29.280
<v Speaker 2>so we can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cannot match that with no argument of</v>

415
00:18:29.281 --> 00:18:32.000
<v Speaker 2>toddler drivers having run over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People know.</v>

416
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.010
<v Speaker 2>Well irresponsible gun owners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is.</v>

417
00:18:35.011 --> 00:18:35.791
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

418
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:39.480
<v Speaker 2>that gets back to what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the education,</v>

419
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:40.314
<v Speaker 2>like learn to own a gun safely to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>it somewhere where a toddlers not going </v>

420
00:18:44.111 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 2>to get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something.</v>

421
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.520
<v Speaker 2>Everything dangerous safely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

422
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.530
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And isn't it funny how you,</v>

423
00:18:49.531 --> 00:18:51.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do kid proof a house,</v>

424
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.160
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

425
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.993
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some plastic things that go </v>

426
00:18:55.411 --> 00:18:58.980
<v Speaker 2>into the electrical sockets and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>poison and this and that.</v>

427
00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.350
<v Speaker 2>What about the gun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

428
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.410
<v Speaker 2>throw it in the candy drawer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it under your pillow.</v>

429
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 2>Kid's never going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

430
00:19:05.581 --> 00:19:06.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

431
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.530
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of responsibility.</v>

432
00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.413
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean I'm laughing at the </v>

433
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:10.944
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous of it and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is true and I think the vast </v>

434
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 2>majority of gun owners are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are um,</v>

435
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.640
<v Speaker 2>responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

436
00:19:17.641 --> 00:19:21.060
<v Speaker 2>it is another group that's painted with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the broad brush,</v>

437
00:19:21.061 --> 00:19:23.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the few gun nuts,</v>

438
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.720
<v Speaker 2>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the paint every NRA member as being</v>

439
00:19:27.721 --> 00:19:29.760
<v Speaker 2>one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that isn't true.</v>

440
00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:30.721
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

441
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:31.554
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people love people who like guns </v>

442
00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:37.740
<v Speaker 2>and they're not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the people who are not that happy to</v>

443
00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:41.670
<v Speaker 2>accept the fact that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>population that is that,</v>

444
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.960
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

445
00:19:42.961 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 2>you can't say that they don't exist </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they do exist.</v>

446
00:19:45.781 --> 00:19:49.980
<v Speaker 2>So a big part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like any other issue,</v>

447
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:50.814
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to start telling each other the </v>

448
00:19:52.481 --> 00:19:54.450
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

449
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.550
<v Speaker 2>About,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about these issues.</v>

450
00:19:56.551 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 2>Like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone has their,</v>

451
00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.290
<v Speaker 2>their side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

452
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.300
<v Speaker 2>or their tribe or their team and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>refuse to believe any truth,</v>

453
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

454
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:10.290
<v Speaker 2>any negative truth about their team or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

455
00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:11.124
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

456
00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 2>like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

457
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:15.120
<v Speaker 2>like we were saying like gun owners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

458
00:20:15.121 --> 00:20:19.140
<v Speaker 2>So there's responsible gun owners and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a few gun blog and just use</v>

459
00:20:19.141 --> 00:20:19.974
<v Speaker 2>the term gun nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the responsible gun owners have to </v>

460
00:20:22.171 --> 00:20:24.540
<v Speaker 2>accept the fact that there was some gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuts,</v>

461
00:20:24.541 --> 00:20:25.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the police.</v>

462
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.510
<v Speaker 2>The vast majority of police are good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the good police have to say,</v>

463
00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.370
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some bad cops too.</v>

464
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.920
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like within any,</v>

465
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.090
<v Speaker 2>within it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any tribe.</v>

466
00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:39.480
<v Speaker 2>We're comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know there are some bad comics.</v>

467
00:20:39.481 --> 00:20:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know what Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to put it out there.</v>

468
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.280
<v Speaker 2>I heard of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

469
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:47.100
<v Speaker 2>but until we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until we do,</v>

470
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 2>we can never</v>

471
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 3>have a real discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

472
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Because everybody just suddenly circles </v>
<v Speaker 3>the wagons around their hurt and like,</v>

473
00:20:53.411 --> 00:20:53.741
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

474
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:54.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>

475
00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.240
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

476
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.550
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not saying all of you are bad,</v>

477
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 3>but let's admit within your group there </v>
<v Speaker 3>is bad.</v>

478
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:02.610
<v Speaker 3>So we can work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

479
00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:03.453
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some tweets from some NRA </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters the last day and a half that </v>

480
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:10.540
<v Speaker 3>are just fucking stunned me were just </v>
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up man.</v>

481
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:11.603
<v Speaker 3>Just really realize what the state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all this is right now and shut the fuck </v>

482
00:21:14.651 --> 00:21:15.550
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And by the way,</v>

483
00:21:15.551 --> 00:21:16.384
<v Speaker 3>there's a video that's going around that</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody put up about me talking about </v>

484
00:21:19.211 --> 00:21:22.180
<v Speaker 3>gun control is not a recent video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when it's from,</v>

485
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 3>but people are putting it up now about </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

486
00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:27.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>destroying the gun control argument.</v>

487
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.393
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

488
00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:32.050
<v Speaker 3>it would be very insensitive for me to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that and to put that up right now.</v>

489
00:21:32.051 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It had nothing to do with.</v>

490
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:36.400
<v Speaker 3>I don't know when it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was from a year or so ago,</v>

491
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that these people,</v>

492
00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:40.863
<v Speaker 3>these NRA supporters would go and tweet </v>
<v Speaker 3>these pro gun messages and get crazy </v>

493
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 3>with it now is exactly what you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

494
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:49.600
<v Speaker 3>They're digging their heels in their </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting their team.</v>

495
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:50.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

496
00:21:50.361 --> 00:21:53.990
<v Speaker 2>and as many people have been saying and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is a sad truth.</v>

497
00:21:53.991 --> 00:21:54.824
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we didn't wake up after Sandy Hook </v>

498
00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.650
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

499
00:21:58.651 --> 00:21:59.360
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

500
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.270
<v Speaker 2>when 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it 21 kids were shot.</v>

501
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That and people denied that it happened </v>

502
00:22:05.481 --> 00:22:07.610
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh that didn't even happen at all that,</v>

503
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.460
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are calling this a false flag.</v>

504
00:22:10.461 --> 00:22:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

505
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.260
<v Speaker 2>so if that didn't wake us up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

506
00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

507
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:19.970
<v Speaker 2>58 people at a music concert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate to say it,</v>

508
00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:21.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to wake us up.</v>

509
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:22.121
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

510
00:22:22.121 --> 00:22:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I have a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What Waking Sop mean?</v>

511
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

512
00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:28.100
<v Speaker 2>wake us up to the point of take some </v>
<v Speaker 2>action,</v>

513
00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.310
<v Speaker 2>but what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of President Alonza,</v>

514
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.550
<v Speaker 2>what would you do the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

515
00:22:31.551 --> 00:22:33.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

516
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.510
<v Speaker 2>to start with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to have the conversation.</v>

517
00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.360
<v Speaker 2>We have to have the conversation about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just,</v>

518
00:22:38.361 --> 00:22:41.960
<v Speaker 2>like we just talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't a necessary.</v>

519
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.160
<v Speaker 2>It is necessary to change our gun laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>are gun laws are too lax.</v>

520
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:48.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what we need to do,</v>

521
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.843
<v Speaker 2>we need to come up with a system just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like we have with cars or anything else </v>

522
00:22:54.231 --> 00:22:58.010
<v Speaker 2>dangerous where you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be trained to use it.</v>

523
00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.503
<v Speaker 2>You have to register whatever it is with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government and you have to have </v>

524
00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:03.314
<v Speaker 2>liability insurance and that and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that information transfer is like the </v>

525
00:23:08.061 --> 00:23:08.894
<v Speaker 2>big loophole is the gun shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right where you go to the gun show and </v>

526
00:23:11.691 --> 00:23:13.670
<v Speaker 2>you could just sell a gun to another </v>
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>

527
00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:17.570
<v Speaker 2>You can do that with all the case in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of states that still the case.</v>

528
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.670
<v Speaker 2>You can do that with a car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

529
00:23:19.671 --> 00:23:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I can sell you my car through Craig's </v>
<v Speaker 2>list,</v>

530
00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:25.910
<v Speaker 2>but I'm still going to go put it in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liability thing.</v>

531
00:23:25.911 --> 00:23:28.460
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I'm liable for what you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the car.</v>

532
00:23:28.461 --> 00:23:29.294
<v Speaker 2>Like I protect myself by reporting it </v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I sold it to you per party </v>

533
00:23:33.201 --> 00:23:34.160
<v Speaker 2>to party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

534
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.900
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

535
00:23:35.901 --> 00:23:37.160
<v Speaker 2>if I'm in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna,</v>

536
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.630
<v Speaker 2>we're gonna add those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get.</v>

537
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.450
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get a handle on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>guns.</v>

538
00:23:41.451 --> 00:23:44.390
<v Speaker 2>We're going to get start tracking how </v>
<v Speaker 2>many they are,</v>

539
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:45.770
<v Speaker 2>where they are,</v>

540
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.450
<v Speaker 3>we're going to collect them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

541
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:52.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Australia and some other </v>
<v Speaker 3>places that had those things were looked</v>

542
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.350
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you own an illegal weapon,</v>

543
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:57.290
<v Speaker 3>like a fully automatic weapon or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever makes it illegal,</v>

544
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 3>you can turn it in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe there's payment or maybe it's just</v>

545
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:04.190
<v Speaker 3>no questions asked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just turn it in and we'll,</v>

546
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.540
<v Speaker 3>we'll destroy it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

547
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:06.374
<v Speaker 3>what happened in Australia as they had a</v>
<v Speaker 3>mass shooting and then they put their </v>

548
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:09.380
<v Speaker 3>foot down and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

549
00:24:09.381 --> 00:24:12.030
<v Speaker 3>Mark Australia just banned them </v>
<v Speaker 3>altogether.</v>

550
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.240
<v Speaker 3>Totally random.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can still use a rifle to hunt.</v>

551
00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:15.913
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way we have this sort of fast and </v>

552
00:24:18.681 --> 00:24:19.514
<v Speaker 3>loose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's very few countries in the world </v>

553
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.980
<v Speaker 3>that have this kind of fast and loose </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun policy.</v>

554
00:24:24.981 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

555
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:29.490
<v Speaker 3>we still have the wild west mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

556
00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:30.863
<v Speaker 3>freedom mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which bill o'reilly did a fucking had a </v>

557
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:37.010
<v Speaker 3>post today where he's talking about that</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the cost of freight.</v>

558
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.880
<v Speaker 3>The freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

559
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.710
<v Speaker 3>Fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

560
00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:40.700
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

561
00:24:40.701 --> 00:24:43.190
<v Speaker 3>it's not the old dickhead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'll give you an example,</v>

562
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:45.020
<v Speaker 3>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I grew up in New York City,</v>

563
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.170
<v Speaker 3>like guns had been illegal in New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>City for a long time.</v>

564
00:24:48.171 --> 00:24:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Now there are guns in New York City,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not as many as people think,</v>

565
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because what happens is when you make it</v>

566
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.290
<v Speaker 3>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the average person,</v>

567
00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.060
<v Speaker 3>they don't go out of their way to get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>gun.</v>

568
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.910
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to have one.</v>

569
00:25:00.911 --> 00:25:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a criminal is going to have guns.</v>

570
00:25:02.370 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Criminals are always going to have guns.</v>

571
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:04.964
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing about the good guy shooting </v>

572
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:09.470
<v Speaker 3>the bad guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't happen that often.</v>

573
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 3>And my personal belief on this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>because in that moment it takes a lot to</v>

574
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:16.670
<v Speaker 3>shoot somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just happened the other day.</v>

575
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:19.550
<v Speaker 3>They just happened the other day saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't happen.</v>

576
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.830
<v Speaker 3>There was an active shooter somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>that was taken out by a,</v>

577
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.470
<v Speaker 3>a good guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gun on her.</v>

578
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.390
<v Speaker 3>It can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

579
00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't happen everywhere all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

580
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.063
<v Speaker 3>But it can happen in a lot of people get</v>
<v Speaker 3>their guns stolen or taken away because </v>

581
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.440
<v Speaker 3>in that moment they can't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

582
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:40.220
<v Speaker 3>And the criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he ain't got nothing to lose.</v>

583
00:25:40.221 --> 00:25:42.230
<v Speaker 3>He's already a criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

584
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:44.360
<v Speaker 3>It's also probably used to violence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

585
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.980
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are not used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>violence.</v>

586
00:25:45.981 --> 00:25:46.814
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of soft people out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they don't know what to do if the </v>

587
00:25:48.831 --> 00:25:50.810
<v Speaker 3>shit hits the fan in any way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or form,</v>

588
00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 3>they just don't know how to handle </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

589
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:53.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

590
00:25:53.271 --> 00:25:54.800
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

591
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.700
<v Speaker 3>that happens in the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they buy a gun to protect themselves,</v>

592
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 3>but they're in no way equipped to use </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

593
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:01.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

594
00:26:01.941 --> 00:26:02.774
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're hoping that they can use it or </v>

595
00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:06.110
<v Speaker 3>to scare people off or something like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

596
00:26:06.111 --> 00:26:07.490
<v Speaker 3>but most likely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

597
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.920
<v Speaker 3>they're not going to be able to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

598
00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:11.300
<v Speaker 3>then there's people that say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

599
00:26:11.301 --> 00:26:14.570
<v Speaker 3>that's them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want the option because I will be able</v>

600
00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:15.550
<v Speaker 3>to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

601
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:16.483
<v Speaker 3>because I'm not a pussy or I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then there's a legal way to get one </v>

602
00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.573
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

603
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.730
<v Speaker 3>you do what it takes to and you register</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

604
00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most gun owners that I know,</v>

605
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.190
<v Speaker 3>and I may be wrong because it's not like</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm deep in the gun culture,</v>

606
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:31.160
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not speaking with that expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just talking about,</v>

607
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.180
<v Speaker 3>of the people I know who have guns,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are into guns and shooting.</v>

608
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I only have one friend who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't want to register his guns or,</v>

609
00:26:39.561 --> 00:26:40.394
<v Speaker 3>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of them I know they're fine with </v>

610
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.230
<v Speaker 3>their gun residue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One</v>

611
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:46.480
<v Speaker 2>friend's argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

612
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I honestly couldn't say I love him.</v>

613
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:53.580
<v Speaker 2>I love him when it comes to guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a little,</v>

614
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.160
<v Speaker 2>he's got some of that paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got some of that,</v>

615
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:59.260
<v Speaker 2>the government government or no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you know,</v>

616
00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:03.630
<v Speaker 2>his thing with we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know it's the wrong term,</v>

617
00:27:03.631 --> 00:27:06.690
<v Speaker 2>but it's the common term assault </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons,</v>

618
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.010
<v Speaker 2>assault type weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

619
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.880
<v Speaker 2>And he said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

620
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.220
<v Speaker 2>well what if there's a home invasion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they use.</v>

621
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:13.063
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ain't nobody invading your broke ass </v>

622
00:27:15.181 --> 00:27:17.620
<v Speaker 2>home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ain't going to want to get your,</v>

623
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.140
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got you.</v>

624
00:27:19.141 --> 00:27:22.820
<v Speaker 2>Got You an average American with a two </v>
<v Speaker 2>bedroom in the suburbs.</v>

625
00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Ain't nobody invading your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ain't got a safe.</v>

626
00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.750
<v Speaker 2>If you were selling crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might want to worry.</v>

627
00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:29.280
<v Speaker 2>You might have some cash around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

628
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Even if you were a good marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributor,</v>

629
00:27:31.571 --> 00:27:33.810
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a bunch of cash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to put in the bank,</v>

630
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.210
<v Speaker 2>but you ain't nobody invading your </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

631
00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to be John Wick.</v>

632
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

633
00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.093
<v Speaker 2>Fucking take out a whole crew of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking into your house flooded and </v>

634
00:27:45.091 --> 00:27:46.890
<v Speaker 2>people over staircases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Wick's,</v>

635
00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:48.330
<v Speaker 2>bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love John.</v>

636
00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:54.150
<v Speaker 2>I ain't got a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love John Wayne my all time favorite.</v>

637
00:27:54.151 --> 00:27:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's sitting around talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>John Wick.</v>

638
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:58.860
<v Speaker 2>When you meet John Wick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shit is over.</v>

639
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.010
<v Speaker 2>That's Kiana reeves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best role.</v>

640
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the matrix.</v>

641
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:05.063
<v Speaker 2>That scene when the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the gangster calls John Leguizamo </v>

642
00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:10.200
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you hit my son?</v>

643
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.663
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why he stole John Wick's car and killed </v>

644
00:28:14.311 --> 00:28:16.110
<v Speaker 2>his dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

645
00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great movie.</v>

646
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Both of them are great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed the second one too.</v>

647
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.420
<v Speaker 2>Silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Preposterous,</v>

648
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.370
<v Speaker 2>unrealistic but awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

649
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:27.323
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like that sort of John Woo type </v>

650
00:28:29.671 --> 00:28:30.800
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

651
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.960
<v Speaker 2>just off the charts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous gun violence.</v>

652
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.310
<v Speaker 2>But it's cartoonish and comic book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

653
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kiano plays it,</v>

654
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:40.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

655
00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:42.810
<v Speaker 2>he's so good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he plays it perfectly,</v>

656
00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:45.270
<v Speaker 2>but just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like any other movie,</v>

657
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.150
<v Speaker 2>the bad guys can't shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

658
00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's 25 guys shooting at him.</v>

659
00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.470
<v Speaker 2>One of them might wing him when grades </v>
<v Speaker 2>his shoulder.</v>

660
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.570
<v Speaker 2>It was getting shot in the shoulder a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

661
00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

662
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:03.270
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the argument is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>not registering guns.</v>

663
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.133
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense because I mean unless </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want a world where everybody </v>

664
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:07.783
<v Speaker 2>just pack and like there's like a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>states where you have a concealed and </v>

665
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.653
<v Speaker 2>open carry that you're just allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed to have a gun on your hip and </v>

666
00:29:16.171 --> 00:29:20.760
<v Speaker 2>just walk everywhere or they have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>test but it's like I'm like,</v>

667
00:29:20.761 --> 00:29:21.594
<v Speaker 2>it used to be here with traffic school </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you just pay the guy and he gives </v>

668
00:29:24.841 --> 00:29:25.674
<v Speaker 2>you the certificate that you went or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they do these tests for carrying </v>

669
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.970
<v Speaker 2>concealed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like you can do it online,</v>

670
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:34.310
<v Speaker 2>you know it.</v>

671
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

672
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:37.253
<v Speaker 2>well you're getting dudes in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do your hunting safety </v>

673
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.220
<v Speaker 2>certificate online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of places</v>

674
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.053
<v Speaker 1>where you can get most places you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go and for $100 safety certificate </v>

675
00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to sit down through a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's eight hours of class and go</v>

676
00:29:50.441 --> 00:29:51.274
<v Speaker 1>through all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to take a test and you </v>

677
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:53.910
<v Speaker 1>have to understand things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

678
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Does it transfer from one state to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>other leg?</v>

679
00:29:57.401 --> 00:29:58.234
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

680
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.490
<v Speaker 2>your license to hunt and Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

681
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 2>For some other states,</v>

682
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:02.783
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have 100 safety certificate in </v>

683
00:30:03.631 --> 00:30:04.464
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

684
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:08.700
<v Speaker 1>It's good I think in almost every state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that's.</v>

685
00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good thing to be,</v>

686
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:15.400
<v Speaker 1>to have to have some knowledge of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety and it's about.</v>

687
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It's called a hunter safety thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even about knowing how to hunt.</v>

688
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:20.333
<v Speaker 1>It's just about knowing how to not get </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot or shoot yourself or shoot someone </v>

689
00:30:23.701 --> 00:30:28.440
<v Speaker 1>else and how a gun works and how a all </v>
<v Speaker 1>various weapons.</v>

690
00:30:28.441 --> 00:30:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Bows and arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crossbows and stuff work.</v>

691
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do any of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a gun though.</v>

692
00:30:32.971 --> 00:30:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you just had to go through an </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hour course to get a gun,</v>

693
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:36.443
<v Speaker 1>how many less people would have guns?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a pass an eight hour course to </v>

694
00:30:38.881 --> 00:30:41.430
<v Speaker 1>legally have a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many fewer people would have gotten?</v>

695
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:43.980
<v Speaker 1>It would probably be like 30 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that have guns now.</v>

696
00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:45.590
<v Speaker 2>Well mean also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

697
00:30:45.591 --> 00:30:48.950
<v Speaker 2>they're saying this is the wrong kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicize it at which yeah,</v>

698
00:30:48.951 --> 00:30:49.784
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's time for a politician to stand up </v>

699
00:30:51.381 --> 00:30:52.214
<v Speaker 2>to the NRA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not politicized because every </v>

700
00:30:54.441 --> 00:30:59.441
<v Speaker 2>politician is afraid to say we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>register all the guns because the NRA is</v>

701
00:30:59.661 --> 00:31:00.780
<v Speaker 2>going to attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

702
00:31:00.781 --> 00:31:03.320
<v Speaker 2>they have their whole lobby machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

703
00:31:03.321 --> 00:31:05.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to take a politician who </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the balls to say,</v>

704
00:31:05.811 --> 00:31:06.411
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

705
00:31:06.411 --> 00:31:10.610
<v Speaker 2>I can get as many people following me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in other words,</v>

706
00:31:10.611 --> 00:31:11.444
<v Speaker 2>challenge the NRA and get as many people</v>
<v Speaker 2>backing you as the NRA has the best way </v>

707
00:31:16.131 --> 00:31:18.320
<v Speaker 2>to do it for these people to not say </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

708
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:21.350
<v Speaker 2>When they don't say shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they don't get the tax.</v>

709
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.610
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're afraid.</v>

710
00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:26.060
<v Speaker 2>They're afraid right now to politicians </v>
<v Speaker 2>who know better,</v>

711
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.283
<v Speaker 2>who absolutely know better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who know that our current situation is </v>

712
00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:34.310
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous and our system is broken in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the gun laws.</v>

713
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:37.220
<v Speaker 2>None of them will stand up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

714
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.310
<v Speaker 2>now except the ones that the NRA already</v>
<v Speaker 2>hates.</v>

715
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bernie Sanders type of characters,</v>

716
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

717
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

718
00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:46.260
<v Speaker 1>There's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the team thing,</v>

719
00:31:46.261 --> 00:31:47.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

720
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supporting the left.</v>

721
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.943
<v Speaker 1>They're supporting the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody meets in the middle and they </v>

722
00:31:51.271 --> 00:31:51.920
<v Speaker 1>yell at each other.</v>

723
00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:52.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

724
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:54.640
<v Speaker 2>and this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

725
00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.120
<v Speaker 2>this is not a left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

726
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:57.643
<v Speaker 2>This is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another one of those common sense </v>

727
00:31:59.241 --> 00:32:01.010
<v Speaker 2>issues where we don't have common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

728
00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.113
<v Speaker 2>I joke sometimes on state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to Canada next week I'm </v>

729
00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:08.360
<v Speaker 2>doing a tour and I had had this joke </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

730
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:12.920
<v Speaker 2>can you explain it to a Canadian like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that should be to test for what sane can</v>

731
00:32:12.921 --> 00:32:16.040
<v Speaker 2>you explain it to a Canadian?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing it regarding healthcare,</v>

732
00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.630
<v Speaker 2>like try to explain to a Canadian why </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've demonized healthcare,</v>

733
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.840
<v Speaker 2>why we want to shut that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you do,</v>

734
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.810
<v Speaker 2>you can't even make meaning that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

735
00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.673
<v Speaker 2>they're anti obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So rather than look for a compromise or </v>

736
00:32:30.441 --> 00:32:31.274
<v Speaker 2>fix the system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just shut it down because it's called </v>

737
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Obamacare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

738
00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the anger at the name.</v>

739
00:32:37.581 --> 00:32:41.180
<v Speaker 2>You lie like that famous night that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kimmel did where it was like,</v>

740
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.990
<v Speaker 2>are you against obamacare?</v>

741
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I hate obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the affordable care act?</v>

742
00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:46.513
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

743
00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:47.390
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

744
00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:48.223
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did a man on the street and </v>

745
00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:51.470
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know so many people were.</v>

746
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:54.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I mean by demonize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you attached this name to it.</v>

747
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.453
<v Speaker 2>So people just are anti just based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that without looking at any rather than </v>

748
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:00.891
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

749
00:33:00.891 --> 00:33:01.724
<v Speaker 2>like maybe this part like to no </v>
<v Speaker 2>preexisting is part of the healthcare </v>

750
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 2>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea.</v>

751
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:06.614
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to keep that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe the cost of this is a bad </v>

752
00:33:09.411 --> 00:33:10.790
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're gonna change that,</v>

753
00:33:10.791 --> 00:33:13.290
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And working to fix it.</v>

754
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.473
<v Speaker 2>The gun issue is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certain freedoms that I </v>

755
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:18.350
<v Speaker 2>understand and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:23.120
<v Speaker 2>the right to bear arms and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again it was written in a completely</v>

757
00:33:23.121 --> 00:33:24.860
<v Speaker 2>different time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

758
00:33:24.861 --> 00:33:27.230
<v Speaker 2>so we need to update that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

759
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Taking into account everything that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with today.</v>

760
00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.353
<v Speaker 3>Well one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to talk about the </v>

761
00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:33.334
<v Speaker 3>affordable care act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you get to talk about healthcare at </v>

762
00:33:34.511 --> 00:33:35.740
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna have to talk about what are</v>

763
00:33:35.741 --> 00:33:37.380
<v Speaker 3>the real issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>

764
00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.000
<v Speaker 3>what are the root causes of diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

765
00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:42.570
<v Speaker 3>and a big part of the root causes </v>
<v Speaker 3>diseases or how people eat and.</v>

766
00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.553
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if people eat poorly and they </v>

767
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:46.263
<v Speaker 3>consume a lot of refined carbohydrates </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of processed sugars and they </v>

768
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.653
<v Speaker 3>know their diet is filled with bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're drinking every day and </v>

769
00:33:52.931 --> 00:33:54.240
<v Speaker 3>they're smoking cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

770
00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:55.503
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to make those choices with </v>

771
00:33:57.161 --> 00:33:59.380
<v Speaker 3>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are going to get diseases.</v>

772
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.470
<v Speaker 3>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost an extra right.</v>

773
00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:03.363
<v Speaker 3>And you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you start battling the </v>

774
00:34:04.481 --> 00:34:08.980
<v Speaker 3>corporations and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big food and stuff like that because you</v>

775
00:34:08.981 --> 00:34:12.070
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it's so much cheaper to poorly,</v>

776
00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:13.293
<v Speaker 3>but just think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's because it's cheaper to </v>

777
00:34:14.741 --> 00:34:16.960
<v Speaker 3>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we think about the,</v>

778
00:34:16.961 --> 00:34:17.371
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

779
00:34:17.371 --> 00:34:21.400
<v Speaker 3>the actual physical numbers of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that die every year from heart disease.</v>

780
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fun</v>

781
00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:24.193
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

782
00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:25.590
<v Speaker 2>look at the amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

783
00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:27.380
<v Speaker 2>of fast food we consume.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

784
00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.800
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like fast food is an evil.</v>

785
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.190
<v Speaker 2>There's times when you know you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the run and you want to grab a burger,</v>

786
00:34:33.191 --> 00:34:34.140
<v Speaker 2>you want to grab for it.</v>

787
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.680
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a whole dot okay.</v>

788
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:37.161
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

789
00:34:37.161 --> 00:34:40.520
<v Speaker 3>But it can't be the only thing you eat </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time.</v>

790
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.750
<v Speaker 3>You saw supersize me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

791
00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.613
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

792
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:44.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean it ain't good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

793
00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.620
<v Speaker 3>it's not good to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just constant bullshit.</v>

794
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:48.643
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't eat that much salt and </v>

795
00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:54.080
<v Speaker 2>grease all the time and not have </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything you do.</v>

796
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:55.363
<v Speaker 2>There's a penalty.</v>

797
00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.750
<v Speaker 3>No Salsa but nxs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

798
00:34:58.751 --> 00:35:01.720
<v Speaker 3>it's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that whole thing about salt being</v>

799
00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:04.150
<v Speaker 3>bad for you in salt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>raising high blood pressure and all that</v>

800
00:35:04.151 --> 00:35:04.984
<v Speaker 3>stuff that was kind of concocted by one </v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor and ran with is really very </v>

801
00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:09.980
<v Speaker 3>little evidence about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

802
00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm black.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God told us not to eat,</v>

803
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.200
<v Speaker 3>so they tell you not to eat fatty foods </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

804
00:35:14.201 --> 00:35:16.780
<v Speaker 3>But meanwhile it's refined carbohydrates</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are.</v>

805
00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:21.100
<v Speaker 3>The real issue is sugar and everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>is in sugar and we are addicted.</v>

806
00:35:21.101 --> 00:35:22.870
<v Speaker 3>We are shooting addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar,</v>

807
00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.940
<v Speaker 3>corn syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean.</v>

808
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:27.520
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also all these studies </v>
<v Speaker 3>that talked to you about red meat,</v>

809
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:28.623
<v Speaker 3>but when you look at the studies about </v>
<v Speaker 3>red meat and you look at the criticisms </v>

810
00:35:30.221 --> 00:35:31.054
<v Speaker 3>of studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like people that eat red meat get more </v>

811
00:35:32.111 --> 00:35:32.944
<v Speaker 3>cancer will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real criticism of those studies is </v>

812
00:35:34.661 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 3>what are you eating with the red meat?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because are you eating like lean</v>

813
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:42.180
<v Speaker 1>like grass fed bison with like asparagus</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Broccoli?</v>

814
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I bet you're pretty fucking healthy if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing that.</v>

815
00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:45.803
<v Speaker 1>The real issues are you eating burgers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't differentiate between the </v>

816
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:49.344
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you talk about people that eat red </v>

817
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:53.760
<v Speaker 1>meat five times a week and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlation between cancer,</v>

818
00:35:53.761 --> 00:35:56.460
<v Speaker 1>they're literally not even taking into </v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration what they eat.</v>

819
00:35:56.461 --> 00:36:00.780
<v Speaker 1>What that red meat are they eating white</v>
<v Speaker 1>bread or the eating sugary soda?</v>

820
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.823
<v Speaker 2>This again Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're talking about the </v>

821
00:36:03.241 --> 00:36:04.074
<v Speaker 2>same thing because it's like the common </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense argument is eliminated because of </v>

822
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.360
<v Speaker 2>common sense arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quiet.</v>

823
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:10.583
<v Speaker 2>So you have the loud yelling or if </v>
<v Speaker 2>course of of you know the meat lobby </v>

824
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:19.140
<v Speaker 2>versus whoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever's the anti meet people.</v>

825
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.750
<v Speaker 2>And so you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the common sense is in between,</v>

826
00:36:21.751 --> 00:36:22.584
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's healthy ways to eat meat or </v>

827
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:25.854
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't need it every with every</v>
<v Speaker 2>meal or not every day you mix it up or </v>

828
00:36:29.371 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not meat,</v>

829
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:31.793
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but needed something that human beings </v>

830
00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:36.420
<v Speaker 2>at eating forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But ways to eat carbohydrates,</v>

831
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 2>sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say healthy ways to eat meat.</v>

832
00:36:38.671 --> 00:36:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying,</v>

833
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.690
<v Speaker 2>what you eat around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is it prepared?</v>

834
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on that,</v>

835
00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:45.163
<v Speaker 2>that can make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can be the difference between </v>

836
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 2>healthy and unhealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

837
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.670
<v Speaker 2>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

838
00:36:50.671 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is supposed to be good for it.</v>

839
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:53.911
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

840
00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:54.744
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fried chicken deep fried chicken has </v>

841
00:36:56.971 --> 00:37:01.971
<v Speaker 2>been sitting in the grease for x number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hours waiting for you to kind of pick</v>

842
00:37:02.131 --> 00:37:03.460
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Flower,</v>

843
00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:04.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

844
00:37:04.411 --> 00:37:05.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

845
00:37:05.611 --> 00:37:08.190
<v Speaker 2>that is not a healthy way to eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>chicken.</v>

846
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.930
<v Speaker 2>Delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Resize me to.</v>

847
00:37:09.931 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 2>You'll never look at chicken the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>way he's doing this.</v>

848
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Take that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ruin chicken for me.</v>

849
00:37:15.021 --> 00:37:15.140
<v Speaker 2>I have</v>

850
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:18.320
<v Speaker 1>an issue with him though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did a show where he was,</v>

851
00:37:18.321 --> 00:37:21.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did like 30 days.</v>

852
00:37:21.171 --> 00:37:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that the name of his show and one of</v>

853
00:37:23.391 --> 00:37:24.224
<v Speaker 1>the things he did was on hormone </v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement surgery or hormone </v>

854
00:37:26.301 --> 00:37:28.520
<v Speaker 1>replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like testosterone replacement and things</v>

855
00:37:28.521 --> 00:37:29.354
<v Speaker 1>along those lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know for a fact that the producer </v>

856
00:37:31.951 --> 00:37:35.270
<v Speaker 1>has tried to go to legitimate doctors </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the doctors turned them down because</v>

857
00:37:35.271 --> 00:37:36.650
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not how you do it.</v>

858
00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:38.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't do anything like that over 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

859
00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when he did for that show,</v>

860
00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.130
<v Speaker 1>because he went to a quack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quack,</v>

861
00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.050
<v Speaker 1>shot him up a testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not him.</v>

862
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.063
<v Speaker 1>The guy on the show that he uses a study</v>
<v Speaker 1>case and they shot this guy up with </v>

863
00:37:49.851 --> 00:37:50.684
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the guy started getting aggressive </v>

864
00:37:51.801 --> 00:37:53.510
<v Speaker 1>and yelling at his kids and his wife was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

865
00:37:53.511 --> 00:37:55.060
<v Speaker 1>I like you Chubby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chubby,</v>

866
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Chubby family.</v>

867
00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.133
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the dumbest fucking example of </v>

868
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.600
<v Speaker 1>the science behind manipulating your </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormones,</v>

869
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.300
<v Speaker 1>like the way you're supposed to do at </v>
<v Speaker 1>his first address,</v>

870
00:38:05.301 --> 00:38:06.440
<v Speaker 1>your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

871
00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.750
<v Speaker 1>you take your diet into consideration </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

872
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:09.763
<v Speaker 1>what are you eating?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting these gigantic insulin </v>

873
00:38:12.591 --> 00:38:13.424
<v Speaker 1>spikes all day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your hormone levels are completely </v>

874
00:38:15.861 --> 00:38:18.290
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon what kind of food you </v>
<v Speaker 1>consume,</v>

875
00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:21.110
<v Speaker 1>so what they would do in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a healthy doctor,</v>

876
00:38:21.111 --> 00:38:23.840
<v Speaker 1>the doctor that I was using this don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>say his name,</v>

877
00:38:23.841 --> 00:38:24.674
<v Speaker 1>but he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he would do is for like the first </v>

878
00:38:27.111 --> 00:38:27.944
<v Speaker 1>couple months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you would do is change </v>

879
00:38:29.991 --> 00:38:30.824
<v Speaker 1>your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you would do is don't </v>

880
00:38:32.571 --> 00:38:35.800
<v Speaker 1>eat late at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing you would do eat healthy</v>

881
00:38:35.801 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 1>food</v>

882
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:41.190
<v Speaker 3>and they would literally check your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your blood nutrition levels and say,</v>

883
00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:41.861
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are.</v>

884
00:38:41.861 --> 00:38:45.280
<v Speaker 3>You're low on Niacin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're low on vitamin D,</v>

885
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:48.070
<v Speaker 3>you're low in vitamin B.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to add these to your diet.</v>

886
00:38:48.071 --> 00:38:49.390
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what your hormone levels are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

887
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:50.111
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh look,</v>

888
00:38:50.111 --> 00:38:53.230
<v Speaker 3>we have this big spike now we have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy baseline.</v>

889
00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Now we've done this for four or five </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

890
00:38:55.271 --> 00:38:58.810
<v Speaker 3>Now we know where you're at and what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>need in this.</v>

891
00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.030
<v Speaker 3>They didn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just shot him up with some shit.</v>

892
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.610
<v Speaker 3>So that guy in his show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

893
00:39:03.611 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 3>I had problems with them ever since and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

894
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:08.740
<v Speaker 3>why would you like that sensationalism?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>

895
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:09.574
<v Speaker 3>Like what you've done is you put </v>
<v Speaker 3>together a show where you've had a </v>

896
00:39:11.621 --> 00:39:14.270
<v Speaker 3>terrible representation of something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

897
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:16.810
<v Speaker 3>millions of people engage in hormone </v>
<v Speaker 3>replacement.</v>

898
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in supersize me,</v>

899
00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:21.940
<v Speaker 3>even if you ate at Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't eat as much as he did.</v>

900
00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't supersize every meal.</v>

901
00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.590
<v Speaker 3>And that was the deal though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said if they offered him supersize he</v>

902
00:39:29.591 --> 00:39:33.800
<v Speaker 3>was going to say they always do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They always offered up upsides.</v>

903
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:34.860
<v Speaker 3>You.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

904
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:39.550
<v Speaker 3>But then I've heard people also say </v>
<v Speaker 3>they've done the same thing they've done</v>

905
00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:40.384
<v Speaker 3>that supersize me diet and try it for 30</v>
<v Speaker 3>days and they didn't have nearly the </v>

906
00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:43.683
<v Speaker 3>negative responses and they thought that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they might've sensationalize that </v>

907
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:47.740
<v Speaker 3>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They probably did.</v>

908
00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's TV.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

909
00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.150
<v Speaker 3>But in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yeah,</v>

910
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.380
<v Speaker 3>and it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

911
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:55.330
<v Speaker 3>you talk about hormones and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

912
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:59.560
<v Speaker 3>different people react to things </v>
<v Speaker 3>different ways.</v>

913
00:39:59.610 --> 00:40:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

914
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:01.840
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their bodies,</v>

915
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.300
<v Speaker 3>some people's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

916
00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.061
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

917
00:40:04.061 --> 00:40:05.170
<v Speaker 3>it drives you crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

918
00:40:05.171 --> 00:40:06.001
<v Speaker 3>That person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

919
00:40:06.001 --> 00:40:06.834
<v Speaker 3>that each junk food all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it has this crazy metabolism and </v>

<v Speaker 3>they never gained weight.</v>

922
00:40:14.711 --> 00:40:15.544
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

923
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's pull.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I guess.</v>

1056
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:08.140
<v Speaker 3>Well that's why they're in the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about a steak and shake?</v>

1057

<v Speaker 3>What do you think of that can suck my </v>
<v Speaker 3>dick.</v>

1058
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:11.910
<v Speaker 3>I said it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peanuts,</v>

<v Speaker 3>peanuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>baphy that hungry.</v>

1060
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:17.993
<v Speaker 3>Hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing wrong with peanuts unless </v>

1061
00:46:18.571 --> 00:46:19.830
<v Speaker 3>you've got a peanut allergy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

1062
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:21.443
<v Speaker 3>Which is another thing we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how different people react to </v>

1063
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:23.754
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The peanut allergy is always like the </v>

1064
00:46:25.051 --> 00:46:27.090
<v Speaker 3>best argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the new thing,</v>

1065
00:46:27.091 --> 00:46:27.924
<v Speaker 3>and I've only heard this recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually this year is the first time I </v>

1066
00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:31.354
<v Speaker 3>heard it where they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't have anything peanut related </v>

1067
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:37.650
<v Speaker 3>on an airplane because a passenger has a</v>
<v Speaker 3>severe peanut allergy.</v>

1068
00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well something.</v>

1069
00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:41.730
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't heard that until this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard it.</v>

1070
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:42.743
<v Speaker 3>When you crack open a peanut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that dust to kind of goes in </v>

1071
00:46:45.181 --> 00:46:46.920
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit kills people.</v>

1072
00:46:46.921 --> 00:46:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is nuts.</v>

1073
00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you didn't,</v>

1074
00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:50.853
<v Speaker 3>you didn't like somebody you got right </v>
<v Speaker 3>up to him and just see a shit cracking </v>

1075
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.640
<v Speaker 3>in their face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be some CSI shit.</v>

1076
00:46:56.641 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Like they'd have to figure out how you </v>
<v Speaker 3>killed him.</v>

1077
00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Who opened the peanut?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1078
00:47:01.171 --> 00:47:02.004
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking this is a terrible </v>

1079
00:47:02.701 --> 00:47:04.500
<v Speaker 3>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I was thinking this about Tom Petty.</v>

1080
00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:07.440
<v Speaker 3>I was like a wonder if Tom Petty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you heard the news about Vegas and had a</v>

1081
00:47:07.441 --> 00:47:10.440
<v Speaker 3>fucking heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine if that got killed?</v>

1082
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.960
<v Speaker 3>Tom Petty from a distance could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that.</v>

1083
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:13.853
<v Speaker 3>How did Tom Petty had a heart attack?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did he know about what time was his </v>

1084
00:47:16.951 --> 00:47:20.610
<v Speaker 3>heart attack?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it Sunday night or was it Sunday Day</v>

1085
00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.370
<v Speaker 3>then?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old was he?</v>

1086
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Sixty six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1087
00:47:24.541 --> 00:47:26.480
<v Speaker 3>That ain't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1088
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:27.413
<v Speaker 3>66.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The loans still fucking kicking ass and </v>

1089
00:47:28.831 --> 00:47:32.950
<v Speaker 3>action movies still is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Liam.</v>

1090
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:38.430
<v Speaker 3>Liam Neeson was taken the second time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking if I'm a thug,</v>

1091
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.990
<v Speaker 3>I can't let a 70 year old whip my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1092
00:47:44.460 --> 00:47:46.450
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain age where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>What training you had listened old man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in my thug prime,</v>

1095
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:53.673
<v Speaker 3>who's like the oldest guy who </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately make sense as like a stone </v>

1096
00:47:57.131 --> 00:48:02.131
<v Speaker 3>cold killer and a movie was at Bronson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Charles Bronson deathwish,</v>

1097
00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:02.910
<v Speaker 3>he was already here.</v>

1098
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:03.743
<v Speaker 3>We're already like fat Charles Bronson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got like the Chubby face and you </v>

1099
00:48:06.761 --> 00:48:11.170
<v Speaker 3>couldn't take his suit off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas like he go back to like the hard</v>

1100
00:48:11.171 --> 00:48:12.760
<v Speaker 3>times Bronson,</v>

<v Speaker 3>he was going to shred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shredded.</v>

1102
00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.793
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to think as anyone in their </v>

1103
00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:22.420
<v Speaker 3>sixties legitimate to whip your ass.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he's a puncher.</v>

1107
00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:29.243
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Foreman's probably 60 years old </v>

1108
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Speaker 3>that he'll fight Stevens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did he call it?</v>

1109
00:48:34.541 --> 00:48:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Steven Seagal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1110
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.000
<v Speaker 3>George Foreman.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You can do anything you want 10 rounds,</v>

1114
00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:45.603
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1115
00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.300
<v Speaker 1>That is so ridiculously stupid if Steven</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seagal,</v>

1116
00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:50.163
<v Speaker 1>because all you'd have to do is pour </v>
<v Speaker 1>water on his head and that black shit </v>

1117
00:48:52.181 --> 00:48:53.014
<v Speaker 1>would just run down into his eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be able to say what does it </v>

1118
00:48:55.301 --> 00:48:56.134
<v Speaker 1>say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Foreman just challenged Steven </v>

1119
00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Seagal to a no holds barred fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

1120
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:04.510
<v Speaker 1>that would be a God damn disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty eight year old boxing legend.</v>

1121
00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Use twitter to challenge 65 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>action movies,</v>

1122
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:12.260
<v Speaker 1>but I've got a $68.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet every</v>

1123
00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:15.690
<v Speaker 3>fucking eight year old former in versus </v>
<v Speaker 3>65 year olds to go</v>

<v Speaker 1>I use boxing.</v>

1125
00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.410

<v Speaker 1>10 rounds in Vegas.</v>

1126
00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:26.330
<v Speaker 1>No weapons hand to handling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That will be a fucking disaster.</v>

1127
00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.433
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Foreman is so big that he had </v>

1128
00:49:29.661 --> 00:49:34.661
<v Speaker 1>this shall defense that he adopted later</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his career where he would curl up.</v>

1129
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was so big.</v>

1130
00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:39.190
<v Speaker 1>There was so much arm there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't hit anything.</v>

1131
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:41.360
<v Speaker 1>You hit his stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could luck with all that.</v>

1132
00:49:41.361 --> 00:49:42.590
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to hurt them to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

1133
00:49:42.890 --> 00:49:47.060
<v Speaker 1>And then he's got these hands that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally like canned hams and he just.</v>

1134
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:49.970
<v Speaker 1>He would just jab people into a coma.</v>

1135
00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:51.313
<v Speaker 3>Should a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's playing for the Milwaukee </v>

1136
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His hands around the basketball.</v>

1137
00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.090
<v Speaker 3>Could you see that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He literally his.</v>

1138
00:49:59.160 --> 00:49:59.993
<v Speaker 3>It's like a soft ball in his hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are getting bigger and </v>

1139
00:50:03.221 --> 00:50:04.054
<v Speaker 3>bigger and bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean go back to like Jack Johnson who </v>

1140
00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:09.730
<v Speaker 3>was a giant when he won the heavyweight </v>
<v Speaker 3>championship.</v>

1141
00:50:09.731 --> 00:50:12.760
<v Speaker 3>It's only sex too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was not wanting to go to a big guy,</v>

1142
00:50:12.970 --> 00:50:13.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1143
00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.170
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big hand moment earlier this year.</v>

1144
00:50:17.171 --> 00:50:20.820
<v Speaker 3>I did a show and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that guy's hands that show.</v>

1145
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:21.783
<v Speaker 3>Show them around the basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have that picture that looks </v>

1146
00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:24.304
<v Speaker 3>cartoonish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't even look real good that </v>

1147
00:50:27.511 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 3>that guy must have a dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a palm tree.</v>

1148
00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit.</v>

1149
00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 3>It's two feet from his middle finger to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the base of his hand.</v>

1150
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:37.000
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that?</v>

1151
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:38.840
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1152
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Centimeters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Centimeters in my.</v>

1153
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.560
<v Speaker 3>Less with the centimeters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Communist.</v>

1154
00:50:46.810 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 3>Same size as Jerry Rice's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

1155
00:50:49.671 --> 00:50:50.930
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1172
00:51:33.951 --> 00:51:34.784
<v Speaker 3>something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A large woman like the woman from game </v>

1173
00:51:38.031 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 3>of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that picture a hold of her,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a lot with animals for sport.</v>

1176

<v Speaker 3>What sport would that kid go into?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any party wants fucking sporty once </v>

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:55.670
<v Speaker 3>everybody get out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about Aaron?</v>

1178
00:51:55.671 --> 00:51:58.490

<v Speaker 3>seven to 80 playing baseball.</v>

1179
00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:02.000
<v Speaker 3>You see how that looks in his hand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Bat looks like a little twig,</v>

1180
00:52:02.001 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 3>like he's swinging a kid's back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you seeing that though?</v>

1181
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:05.930
<v Speaker 3>That's one thing that's interesting.</v>

1182
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Like that guy in the past might've gone </v>
<v Speaker 3>into football,</v>

1183
00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:12.200
<v Speaker 3>but now guys we're looking at football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1184
00:52:12.201 --> 00:52:14.000
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame them.</v>

1185
00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:17.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's guys that are retiring at 24,</v>

1186
00:52:17.151 --> 00:52:17.984
<v Speaker 3>25 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why am I going to have a three year </v>

1187
00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:20.804
<v Speaker 3>career with possible concussion damage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and everything is possible when I could </v>

1188
00:52:23.961 --> 00:52:28.961
<v Speaker 3>play baseball or basketball for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and leave with $100,</v>

1189
00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 3>million dollars and just fuck everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>that moves.</v>

1190
00:52:31.830 --> 00:52:32.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a study on former basketball </v>

1191
00:52:34.581 --> 00:52:38.600
<v Speaker 3>players or former football players were </v>
<v Speaker 3>either in a hundred 11 players.</v>

1192
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:41.060
<v Speaker 3>One hundred and 10 of them had cte </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheese.</v>

1193
00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Hundred and 10 out of 111.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1194
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.300
<v Speaker 3>There's the guy who was the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind that movie concussion.</v>

1195
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:50.690
<v Speaker 3>He was recently talking about Oj Simpson</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Oj Simpson was released and he's</v>

1196
00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:51.524
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's 100 percent chance that guy has </v>

1197
00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:57.570
<v Speaker 3>cte and they've even said that Oj,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the trial was today,</v>

1198
00:52:57.921 --> 00:53:01.840
<v Speaker 3>his doctor said that he would introduce </v>
<v Speaker 3>cte as a defense offense,</v>

1199
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.013
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy because then you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>say he's guilty because the defect is </v>

1200
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:07.340
<v Speaker 3>always.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't do it,</v>

1201
00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:10.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>until he wrote a book how I did it.</v>

1202
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I did it,</v>

1203
00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:12.590
<v Speaker 3>that was the book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1204
00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:16.130
<v Speaker 3>but if it's in tiny little red one and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>did it.</v>

1205
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I watched the Cuba gooding show last </v>
<v Speaker 3>night to fx show.</v>

1206
00:53:20.481 --> 00:53:21.314
<v Speaker 3>I'd never seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd never seen people versus Oj </v>

1207
00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Simpson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

1208
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 3>It was a great record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You great show.</v>

1209
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.040
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird to watch man to,</v>

1210
00:53:28.041 --> 00:53:29.580
<v Speaker 2>to revisit everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

1211
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.520
<v Speaker 2>The night when the Oj got out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1212
00:53:32.521 --> 00:53:33.990
<v Speaker 2>just go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1213
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.430
<v Speaker 2>just go quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't say anything.</v>

1214
00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Play Golf and keep your mouth shut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't do this.</v>

1215
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.480
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he can't.</v>

1216
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:44.550
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's addicted to love.</v>

1217
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.940
<v Speaker 2>He's addicted to people liking them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to always,</v>

1218
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:48.953
<v Speaker 2>if he goes to Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of fucking stupid people </v>

1219
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:52.070
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to take them right there.</v>

1220
00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or He's going back to jail.</v>

1221
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:54.743
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do something stupid and violate his </v>

1222
00:53:56.791 --> 00:53:57.624
<v Speaker 2>parole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you'll do that though at </v>

1223
00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.390
<v Speaker 2>seven years old or whatever he is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1224
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.313
<v Speaker 2>if he does anything other than shut up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's either going to die or go back to </v>

1225
00:54:04.861 --> 00:54:06.120
<v Speaker 2>jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1226
00:54:06.121 --> 00:54:10.020
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no positive that's going to come</v>

1227
00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:12.960
<v Speaker 2>out of him making public appearances.</v>

1228
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing a book,</v>

1229
00:54:14.881 --> 00:54:16.770
<v Speaker 2>going on the talk show circuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no,</v>

1230
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:21.120
<v Speaker 2>like you're 70 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live out the last 10,</v>

1231
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:22.680
<v Speaker 2>15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 years,</v>

1232
00:54:22.681 --> 00:54:24.470
<v Speaker 2>whatever you got just lifted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

1233
00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:26.250
<v Speaker 2>And there's money somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1234
00:54:26.251 --> 00:54:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Because Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't take his money,</v>

1235
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:31.170
<v Speaker 2>like moved there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's gotten money somewhere.</v>

1236
00:54:31.171 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Just just quietly fade away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1237
00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:35.214
<v Speaker 2>like people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people might recognize you when you go </v>

1238
00:54:36.841 --> 00:54:41.841
<v Speaker 2>down to play Bingo at the home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wave bank some oprah in the,</v>

1239
00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:43.530
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1240
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:45.300
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1241
00:54:45.301 --> 00:54:49.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no positive public appearance.</v>

1242
00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:51.210
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Oj could make.</v>

1243
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:52.133
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1244
00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:53.003
<v Speaker 1>The attorney general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Florida was saying that </v>

1245
00:54:55.171 --> 00:54:57.690
<v Speaker 1>she didn't want him hopping around her </v>
<v Speaker 1>state playing,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing golf,</v>

1249
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.780

1250
00:55:05.781 --> 00:55:09.290
<v Speaker 2>top cop and she can prosecute him for </v>
<v Speaker 2>any made up shit she wants</v>

1251
00:55:10.020 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not America.</v>

1252
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.340
<v Speaker 1>See when someone gets a fucking release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1253
00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:15.930
<v Speaker 1>you're released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on parole,</v>

1254
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.823
<v Speaker 1>you're released from prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just target someone because </v>

1255
00:55:19.261 --> 00:55:21.270
<v Speaker 1>they're famous and they had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>released through you.</v>

1256
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.690
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with a million fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>murderers are getting out every day.</v>

1257
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:26.370
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a million obviously,</v>

1258
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:27.204
<v Speaker 1>but you're dealing with a shit ton of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were armed robbers and have </v>

1259
00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:31.730
<v Speaker 1>committed assault and rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting out.</v>

1260
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:32.791
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1261
00:55:32.791 --> 00:55:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about,</v>

1262
00:55:33.811 --> 00:55:37.890
<v Speaker 2>and we were talking about this earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical versus reality in theory,</v>

1263
00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:41.370
<v Speaker 2>this is the United States of America and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have freedoms and they can't do that</v>

1264
00:55:41.371 --> 00:55:43.560
<v Speaker 2>to you in reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>

1265
00:55:43.561 --> 00:55:46.050
<v Speaker 2>They can do it because it's like if they</v>
<v Speaker 2>follow you around,</v>

1266
00:55:46.051 --> 00:55:49.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a cop followed you all day every day,</v>

1267
00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:52.080
<v Speaker 2>you would break the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think so you.</v>

1268
00:55:52.081 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know how.</v>

1269
00:55:53.430 --> 00:55:56.850

01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:31.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just a little,</v>

1386
01:00:31.690 --> 01:00:34.040
<v Speaker 2>little bit louder now when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bike like that,</v>

1387
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:37.550
<v Speaker 2>like the ideas that they're slower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1388
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.970
<v Speaker 2>But they're more comfortable then you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know what that bike,</v>

1389
01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:44.450
<v Speaker 2>that bike is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunset Strip and pch.</v>

1390
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just cruising.</v>

1391
01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.550
<v Speaker 2>You know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that.</v>

1392
01:00:47.620 --> 01:00:48.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>

1393
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look good.</v>

1394
01:00:50.631 --> 01:00:54.640
<v Speaker 2>You got a stereo and you just chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you say our stereo,</v>

1395
01:00:54.641 --> 01:00:56.000
<v Speaker 2>like you can hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1396
01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're blasting.</v>

1397
01:00:57.451 --> 01:00:58.520
<v Speaker 2>It's everybody here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1398
01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.600
<v Speaker 2>it's a little weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't like being that guy,</v>

1399
01:01:02.601 --> 01:01:04.700
<v Speaker 2>one of them at a light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1400
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:06.350
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you're riding along,</v>

1401
01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 2>nobody's really hearing it that much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1402
01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:09.740
<v Speaker 2>you're passing people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1403
01:01:09.741 --> 01:01:11.450
<v Speaker 2>when you're sitting at a light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1404
01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.580
<v Speaker 2>and I know guys who go with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1405
01:01:13.581 --> 01:01:15.470
<v Speaker 2>a thousand watts and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their bags,</v>

1406
01:01:15.471 --> 01:01:16.970
<v Speaker 2>their saddleback is a speaker.</v>

1407
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're broadcasting,</v>

1408
01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:21.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be that guy,</v>

1409
01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.150
<v Speaker 2>but it is kind of Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1410
01:01:23.151 --> 01:01:26.180
<v Speaker 2>this is stuff that I hadn't done until I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got to spike.</v>

1411
01:01:26.181 --> 01:01:27.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now I'm realizing I'm like,</v>

1412
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 2>this shit ain't bad if I'm cruising </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1413
01:01:30.081 --> 01:01:33.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holland or pch or something like that.</v>

1414
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:34.820
<v Speaker 2>And I'm listening to music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1415
01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:35.893
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can hear the music over the sound of </v>

1416
01:01:37.371 --> 01:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>the engine and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1417
01:01:39.041 --> 01:01:41.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the speakers are loud enough systems,</v>

1418
01:01:41.620 --> 01:01:44.510
<v Speaker 2>loud music blaring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mostly Jazz.</v>

1419
01:01:44.511 --> 01:01:47.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm chilling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a jazz jazz,</v>

1420
01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.280
<v Speaker 2>jazz and hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are my two.</v>

1421
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.173
<v Speaker 2>You really do like jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you one of those people I legitimately </v>

1422
01:01:53.391 --> 01:01:54.224
<v Speaker 2>love Jasmine on the jazz is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that like weird dudes put on to </v>

1423
01:01:58.851 --> 01:02:03.770
<v Speaker 2>pretend the girls that they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated,</v>

1424
01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:04.613
<v Speaker 2>he likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some jazz that is like that and </v>

1425
01:02:07.131 --> 01:02:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll admit I had to like learn that </v>
<v Speaker 2>level of jazz.</v>

1426
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>Like there's a level of jazz that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1427
01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:14.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this girl I dated,</v>

1428
01:02:14.211 --> 01:02:15.044
<v Speaker 2>she would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you listening to that sketchy jazz </v>

1429
01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:19.590
<v Speaker 2>shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit you have to listen to,</v>

1430
01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:22.140
<v Speaker 2>to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in the beginning only meet other</v>

1431
01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:23.710
<v Speaker 2>musicians understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1432
01:02:23.711 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 2>And I know some jazz musicians and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were breaking it down,</v>

1433
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:28.170
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of jazz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

1434
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:31.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to explain it to music.</v>

1435
01:02:31.591 --> 01:02:35.040
<v Speaker 2>Played by master musicians and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1436
01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:35.874
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's good because when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to a guy like Robert Glasper </v>

1437
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 2>who's really hot now or Herbie Hancock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you listen to Herbie Hancock,</v>

1438
01:02:42.570 --> 01:02:44.070
<v Speaker 2>play a piano,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1439
01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:46.110
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how it's supposed to sound.</v>

1440
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.550
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he's just.</v>

1441
01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.640
<v Speaker 2>He just has mastered that instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1442
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:52.020
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

1443
01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:54.120
<v Speaker 2>I listened to some of that and it and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be,</v>

1444
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 2>there's times when it's out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's meditative and shit like that,</v>

1445
01:02:58.020 --> 01:02:58.853
<v Speaker 2>but don't get me wrong.</v>

1446
01:02:59.180 --> 01:02:59.881
<v Speaker 2>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1447
01:02:59.881 --> 01:03:02.130
<v Speaker 2>you might pass by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be cranking Jay z,</v>

1448
01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love hip hop,</v>

1449
01:03:05.191 --> 01:03:06.570
<v Speaker 2>love old school hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit.</v>

1450
01:03:06.571 --> 01:03:10.050
<v Speaker 2>I grew up with the old eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you play music at all?</v>

1451
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:11.543
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of people that learned to jazz </v>

1452
01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:14.420
<v Speaker 2>actually played music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1453
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.293
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I appreciate it because I have </v>

1454
01:03:17.911 --> 01:03:22.911
<v Speaker 2>no musical talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the masters of it fascinate me and in</v>

1455
01:03:23.221 --> 01:03:27.150
<v Speaker 2>the last 10 years I've been doing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>these jazz cruises,</v>

1456
01:03:27.151 --> 01:03:29.070
<v Speaker 2>hosting jazz festivals and this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1457
01:03:29.071 --> 01:03:31.800
<v Speaker 2>and I found it's really true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you know this because you know,</v>

1458
01:03:31.801 --> 01:03:32.634
<v Speaker 2>musicians to that thing about every </v>
<v Speaker 2>musician wants to be a comic and every </v>

1459
01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:40.050
<v Speaker 2>comic wants to be a musician.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have this mutual admiration</v>

1460
01:03:40.051 --> 01:03:41.760
<v Speaker 2>thing with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with jazz artists,</v>

1461
01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:42.211
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1462
01:03:42.211 --> 01:03:43.500
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could play that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

1463
01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was funny.</v>

1464
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's,</v>

1465
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:50.460
<v Speaker 2>there's something about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

1466
01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.950
<v Speaker 2>not jazz necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people in bands,</v>

1467
01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 2>they can play the same shit forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing I can't do,</v>

1468
01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I get on jazz artists about that old </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1469
01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Like they'll play like there's a track </v>
<v Speaker 2>called so what?</v>

1470
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:02.640
<v Speaker 2>By Miles Davis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1471
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Classic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jazzy.</v>

1472
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.153
<v Speaker 2>Like miles wrote this in 1959 and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can play it and your considered </v>

1473
01:04:09.811 --> 01:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>

1474
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:13.180
<v Speaker 2>How does that shit work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>

1475
01:04:13.181 --> 01:04:18.110
<v Speaker 2>At no point can I do Eddie Murphy's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gunny boohoo and suddenly be that Alonza</v>

1476
01:04:18.111 --> 01:04:23.100
<v Speaker 2>was a brilliant comment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You hear that goody Google maps for 59.</v>

1477
01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.070
<v Speaker 2>Fifty nine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1478
01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Fifty nine comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get fucking rockstar.</v>

1479
01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:31.860
<v Speaker 2>Not Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like comedy from 59.</v>

1480
01:04:31.861 --> 01:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1481
01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Try listening to some old Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm a huge Lenny Bruce Fan.</v>

1482
01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I've framed Lenny Bruce posters in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>home,</v>

1483
01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.360
<v Speaker 2>but if you tried to listen to it today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the culture has bypass these ideas.</v>

1484
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was revolutionary in groundbreaking </v>

1485
01:04:47.941 --> 01:04:48.774
<v Speaker 2>at the time because the culture was so </v>
<v Speaker 2>childish and infant tile and it's its </v>

1486
01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:58.010
<v Speaker 2>ideas and understanding of like weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts are abstract concepts or things</v>

1487
01:04:58.501 --> 01:05:03.380
<v Speaker 2>like a censorship or or racism or any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that when Bruce Cover.</v>

1488
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Then when he was covering them back then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were groundbreaking,</v>

1489
01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.540
<v Speaker 2>but now like a lot of the stuff he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying is just done.</v>

1490
01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.733
<v Speaker 2>But I think I think a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics because years ago we were having </v>

1491
01:05:13.831 --> 01:05:16.170
<v Speaker 2>this debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is before rape.</v>

1492
01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were having this debate about cosby.</v>

1493
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.550
<v Speaker 2>You got to put that qualifier in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brooklyn.</v>

1494
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You always have to end.</v>

1495
01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he started today,</v>

1496
01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:26.103
<v Speaker 2>would he make it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I argued yes because his comedy </v>

1497
01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:32.470
<v Speaker 2>would have been different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he still,</v>

1498
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:33.333
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1499
01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:34.323
<v Speaker 2>like Lenny Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wouldn't have been talking about the </v>

1500
01:05:36.341 --> 01:05:38.890
<v Speaker 2>things he was talking about and 59 or </v>
<v Speaker 2>60,</v>

1501
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 2>he'd be talking about the same shit that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk about today,</v>

1502
01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.293
<v Speaker 2>but he still would have had that </v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant comic mind and he still would </v>

1503
01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows what he had been talking about</v>

1504
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.140
<v Speaker 2>because he'd have been kicking down </v>
<v Speaker 2>doors today.</v>

1505
01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he would've been just at some,</v>

1506
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1507
01:05:54.281 --> 01:05:57.640
<v Speaker 2>But I think those comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of them,</v>

1508
01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:59.800
<v Speaker 2>that's the brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely the brilliant ones.</v>

1509
01:05:59.801 --> 01:06:03.400
<v Speaker 2>The top ones would be funny today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just talk about the topics.</v>

1510
01:06:03.401 --> 01:06:04.080
<v Speaker 2>We talk about</v>

1511
01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.190
<v Speaker 3>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1512
01:06:05.191 --> 01:06:06.024
<v Speaker 3>I think so too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a matter of the time </v>

1513
01:06:07.711 --> 01:06:10.890
<v Speaker 3>and the error that they existed in and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But conversely,</v>

1514
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:11.813
<v Speaker 3>if you took someone from today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you took dave chappelle and yet </v>

1515
01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.330
<v Speaker 3>dave chappelle doing standup at 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd probably be like,</v>

1516
01:06:18.331 --> 01:06:20.290
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1517
01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:21.173
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a baby selling </v>

1518
01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:27.560
<v Speaker 3>crap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kids didn't seem chappelle in 1959.</v>

1519
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.710
<v Speaker 3>Never would have never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well just.</v>

1520
01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:32.663
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1521
01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.790
<v Speaker 3>it's not relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1522
01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:37.530
<v Speaker 3>It has to be relevant to the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1523
01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:38.423
<v Speaker 3>a brilliant comedian of today trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk about the same subjects we talk </v>

1524
01:06:41.011 --> 01:06:42.740
<v Speaker 3>about today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just you.</v>

1525
01:06:43.490 --> 01:06:44.323
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the weird thing about comedy </v>

1526
01:06:45.901 --> 01:06:48.010
<v Speaker 3>really does reflect the era in which</v>

1527
01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:49.880
<v Speaker 2>performed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely,</v>

1528
01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:51.920
<v Speaker 2>it's the culture that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>

1529
01:06:51.921 --> 01:06:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Vaudeville right when,</v>

1530
01:06:54.591 --> 01:06:56.530
<v Speaker 2>when all you had to do with juggle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>hit a guy</v>

1531
01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:59.830
<v Speaker 3>would hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was all,</v>

1532
01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:01.463
<v Speaker 3>you got that old hammer bit when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were here would do like a Japanese </v>

1533
01:07:05.441 --> 01:07:07.630
<v Speaker 3>impression and put like a cigar in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mouth,</v>

1534
01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:11.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the buck to haul.</v>

1535
01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.340
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why that?</v>

1536
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.193
<v Speaker 3>I never understood that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how does that represent Japanese </v>

1537
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:16.360
<v Speaker 3>people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The buck tooth thing.</v>

1538
01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:19.140
<v Speaker 3>Who was it to the debt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy who did that.</v>

1539
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know you're talking about them.</v>

1540
01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Picture in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It definitely,</v>

1542
01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:26.563
<v Speaker 2>definitely what we do as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in the time I'd say even in the </v>

1543
01:07:29.271 --> 01:07:30.104
<v Speaker 2>time we've been doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I started in [inaudible] 93 and </v>

1544
01:07:34.491 --> 01:07:37.560
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely different now than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1545
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.760
<v Speaker 2>than it was then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was def jam right when I was.</v>

1546
01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I started out def jam was it?</v>

1547
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:47.450
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I caught a lot of hell being a black</v>

1548
01:07:47.451 --> 01:07:50.820
<v Speaker 2>comic who wasn't a def jam type out </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments.</v>

1549
01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:52.880
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell you talking about?</v>

1550
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:54.860
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

1551
01:07:54.861 --> 01:07:56.270
<v Speaker 2>I'm on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on NPR,</v>

1552
01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now is cool,</v>

1553
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:04.030
<v Speaker 2>but in [inaudible] 94 probably wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been the coolest,</v>

1554
01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:05.130
<v Speaker 2>coolest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

1555
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:06.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that interesting?</v>

1556
01:08:06.121 --> 01:08:07.190
<v Speaker 3>Like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1557
01:08:07.191 --> 01:08:09.840
<v Speaker 3>you get expected to fit into a certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>genre,</v>

1558
01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:10.710
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.980
<v Speaker 3>And then there's like there's markets </v>
<v Speaker 3>for that genre.</v>

1560
01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when def jam</v>

1561
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:16.843
<v Speaker 2>was big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a market for that kind of </v>

1562
01:08:18.141 --> 01:08:23.000
<v Speaker 2>comedy and a lot of you saw a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>comedians like mold themselves into that</v>

1563
01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:24.030
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1564
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:24.883
<v Speaker 2>And I always thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was lucky in that a few of the </v>

1565
01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:28.553
<v Speaker 2>pros I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember like cedric the entertainer </v>

1566
01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.473
<v Speaker 2>was one and Tommy Davidson was another </v>
<v Speaker 2>and George Wallace was another who told </v>

1567
01:08:37.431 --> 01:08:39.080
<v Speaker 2>me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do like,</v>

1568
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>do you like you cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like don't worry about that shit because</v>

1569
01:08:43.730 --> 01:08:46.810
<v Speaker 2>the only thing worse than being a deaf </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy would not,</v>

1570
01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:48.553
<v Speaker 2>would be a fake def jam comic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the only thing worse than not </v>

1571
01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:51.824
<v Speaker 2>fitting in would be a fake def jam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for me to suddenly pretend like I </v>

1572
01:08:56.301 --> 01:08:58.820
<v Speaker 2>grew up in Queens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in St Albans,</v>

1573
01:08:58.821 --> 01:09:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Queens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working class,</v>

1574
01:09:00.321 --> 01:09:03.110
<v Speaker 2>black neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parents both had jobs,</v>

1575
01:09:03.111 --> 01:09:06.890
<v Speaker 2>but we had a house with a yard and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two car garage and the whole bit.</v>

1576
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:07.641
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Rich,</v>

1577
01:09:07.641 --> 01:09:09.020
<v Speaker 2>not poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just working class.</v>

1578
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:10.243
<v Speaker 2>If I tried to come at you like I grew up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the south bronx and I have friends </v>

1579
01:09:13.011 --> 01:09:14.380
<v Speaker 2>from the South Bronx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1580
01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:15.463
<v Speaker 2>I have friends from Bedstuy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would have been fake and you'd </v>

1581
01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:21.310
<v Speaker 2>have seen right through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were from bed Stuy,</v>

1582
01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.330
<v Speaker 2>you'd have seen through my ass in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

1583
01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:25.003
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might have fooled you if you were </v>

1584
01:09:26.271 --> 01:09:27.010
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1585
01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:29.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado or some shit for me.</v>

1586
01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Davidson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy Davidson.</v>

1587
01:09:31.791 --> 01:09:33.980
<v Speaker 2>Where's he at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy still out there.</v>

1588
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:35.210
<v Speaker 2>Tommy still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1589
01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:38.150
<v Speaker 2>clubs and doing this thing on rare </v>
<v Speaker 2>occasions.</v>

1590
01:09:38.151 --> 01:09:40.580
<v Speaker 2>Once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll always have love for Tommy.</v>

1591
01:09:40.581 --> 01:09:45.581
<v Speaker 2>Tommy helped me when I was new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy took me on the road with him for a</v>

1592
01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:49.280
<v Speaker 2>summer and I learned a lot and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>introduced me to clubs that I got into.</v>

1593
01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:50.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tommy was.</v>

1594
01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.450
<v Speaker 2>Tommy was a brilliant talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1595
01:09:53.451 --> 01:09:54.284
<v Speaker 2>the drug thing really hurt Tommy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went through that phase and I think </v>

1596
01:09:59.481 --> 01:10:04.481
<v Speaker 2>what hurt him with that was that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed a reputation for unreliability</v>

1597
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:07.490
<v Speaker 2>where he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1598
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:12.290
<v Speaker 2>people like is he going to show up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was the worst thing to hear,</v>

1599
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:16.100
<v Speaker 2>but talent wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was just amazing.</v>

1600
01:10:16.101 --> 01:10:16.934
<v Speaker 2>Like I would watch Tommy worked some </v>
<v Speaker 2>nights when Tommy did a story and I </v>

1601
01:10:20.481 --> 01:10:21.314
<v Speaker 2>don't know how much you've ever seen him</v>
<v Speaker 2>on stage and with a bunch of the store </v>

1602
01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:24.673
<v Speaker 2>when he starts becoming each different </v>
<v Speaker 2>character in the story with his voices </v>

1603
01:10:28.911 --> 01:10:30.920
<v Speaker 2>and singing and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant.</v>

1604
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

1605
01:10:31.611 --> 01:10:35.600
<v Speaker 2>I used to watch that and just be blown </v>
<v Speaker 2>away that he had that kind of talent.</v>

1606
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.010
<v Speaker 2>The fucking drug thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1607
01:10:37.011 --> 01:10:39.710
<v Speaker 2>that's the drug to that cocaine drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1608
01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:41.960
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about the drug thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very rarely the pot.</v>

1609
01:10:42.270 --> 01:10:43.670
<v Speaker 2>That's always the drug thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1610
01:10:43.671 --> 01:10:44.504
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's he doing?</v>

1611
01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:45.393
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math,</v>

1612
01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.600
<v Speaker 2>coke,</v>

01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.190
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you literally see them in a nod.</v>

1622
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.430
<v Speaker 2>I was in Cleveland</v>

1623
01:11:14.790 --> 01:11:17.070
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early this past summer,</v>

1624
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:19.110
<v Speaker 3>downtown Cleveland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ohio.</v>

1625
01:11:19.111 --> 01:11:19.944
<v Speaker 3>It's got this like one of the bad opioid</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and you would just literally see </v>

1626
01:11:23.311 --> 01:11:26.670
<v Speaker 3>people on the bench just nodding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like going into it.</v>

1627
01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:27.990
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1628
01:11:27.991 --> 01:11:28.860
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1629
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:30.930
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's been there but.</v>

1630
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.330
<v Speaker 3>But when people are sitting out on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>park bench,</v>

1631
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.300
<v Speaker 3>just going into a nod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a problem.</v>

1632
01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:38.203
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem in Massachusetts to Rizza </v>

1633
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:41.993
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Bourdain show he was doing about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it recently where the problem in </v>

1634
01:11:43.561 --> 01:11:48.510
<v Speaker 3>Massachusetts was that they were giving </v>
<v Speaker 3>out pain pills to people so easily.</v>

1635
01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people got hooked and then when they</v>

1636
01:11:50.911 --> 01:11:54.720
<v Speaker 3>try to get off the pain pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were tightened down,</v>

1637
01:11:54.721 --> 01:11:57.750
<v Speaker 3>the read the regulations on them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then people started turning to heroin.</v>

1638
01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:58.773
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a thing in the nineties </v>

1639
01:12:00.181 --> 01:12:01.014
<v Speaker 3>with the opioids when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they came out with Oxycontin and </v>

1640
01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:06.530
<v Speaker 3>all those related drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they told the doctor it's not,</v>

1641
01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.290
<v Speaker 3>it's not addicting.</v>

1642
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:08.123
<v Speaker 3>Go ahead and write the prescription.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now some of those pharmaceutical </v>

1643
01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:11.034
<v Speaker 3>companies are paying like big lawsuits </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they knew back then that it was </v>

1644
01:12:14.491 --> 01:12:15.330
<v Speaker 3>addicting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:16.164
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking to another friend of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine the other day about a pain pills </v>

1646
01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.320

<v Speaker 3>He was a recovering from a surgery.</v>

1647
01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.273
<v Speaker 3>They gave him some pain pills and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he had some complications with the </v>

1648
01:12:25.771 --> 01:12:27.070
<v Speaker 3>recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a.</v>

1649
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:29.010
<v Speaker 3>God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>

1650
01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:29.844

<v Speaker 3>They had to do a re done another </v>

1651
01:12:33.301 --> 01:12:34.134
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had to go in and because it has </v>

1652
01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:35.953
<v Speaker 3>some scar tissue and there's like know </v>
<v Speaker 3>four weeks later they'd go and do </v>

1653
01:12:39.211 --> 01:12:40.810
<v Speaker 3>another surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1655
01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:47.240
<v Speaker 3>months and then he tries to get off of </v>
<v Speaker 3>him and he says,</v>

1708
01:14:56.011 --> 01:14:58.440
<v Speaker 2>Write about anything you feel is a drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it.</v>

1709
01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:01.890
<v Speaker 2>Like any physical or emotional feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have.</v>

1710
01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.920
<v Speaker 2>I didn't see that drug for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a long time ago.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1713
01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.490
<v Speaker 2>There's a drug to make it</v>

1714
01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.000
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I got my nose fixed,</v>

1715
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.863
<v Speaker 1>I got a deviated septum operated on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pulled out a bunch of scar tissue </v>

1716
01:15:15.541 --> 01:15:18.630
<v Speaker 1>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm telling you there was no pain.</v>

1717
01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was uncomfortable for as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>time as they had the packet.</v>

1718
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:23.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was packed up with a gauze or these </v>

1719
01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.033
<v Speaker 1>foam things with tubes hanging out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dripped like the blood is dripping out </v>

1720
01:15:30.661 --> 01:15:32.670
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was uncomfortable.</v>

1721
01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:33.533
<v Speaker 1>But what I mean uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't feel good to shove both </v>

1722
01:15:36.061 --> 01:15:37.560
<v Speaker 1>fingers up your nose and leave them </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1723
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:41.880
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't in pain and my doctor was </v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing the pills on me.</v>

1724
01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:42.953
<v Speaker 1>He gave me two different prescriptions </v>
<v Speaker 1>for pain pills for vicodins and I think </v>

1725
01:15:46.321 --> 01:15:47.970
<v Speaker 1>of the other ones roxies and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1726
01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.770
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

1727
01:15:49.771 --> 01:15:51.120
<v Speaker 1>well it might hurt later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1730
01:15:55.591 --> 01:15:57.570
<v Speaker 1>what's going to change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how's it going to hurt later?</v>

1731
01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.660
<v Speaker 1>Like right now it's just like my nose </v>
<v Speaker 1>feels uncomfortable.</v>

1732
01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not painful though.</v>

1733
01:16:02.281 --> 01:16:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people just,</v>

1734
01:16:04.230 --> 01:16:05.063
<v Speaker 1>you get told by your doctor that you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in pain and you might be </v>

1735
01:16:08.101 --> 01:16:09.420
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have some pills for,</v>

1736
01:16:09.421 --> 01:16:10.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jesus,</v>

1737
01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I better take these pills for it gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

1738
01:16:11.790 --> 01:16:13.950
<v Speaker 1>I better take these pills before I can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>take it anymore.</v>

1739
01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:18.620
<v Speaker 2>And he started freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say this,</v>

1740
01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:23.510
<v Speaker 2>I did find out the medical use for </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine and it absolutely works numbing.</v>

1741
01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had um,</v>

1742
01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:28.010
<v Speaker 2>a ripped cornea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1743
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Playing Ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy finger ripped across and,</v>

1744
01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:35.330
<v Speaker 2>and I'm talking the kind of pain where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just hit the ground,</v>

1745
01:16:35.331 --> 01:16:37.460
<v Speaker 2>like you're just done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your body is like,</v>

1746
01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.780
<v Speaker 2>don't do shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are in May.</v>

1747
01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.760
<v Speaker 2>And I went to the doctor and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use.</v>

1748
01:16:40.761 --> 01:16:45.761
<v Speaker 2>They put liquid cocaine eye drops in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>eye and the pain disappeared instantly.</v>

1749
01:16:46.311 --> 01:16:47.270
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I?</v>

1750
01:16:47.271 --> 01:16:48.380
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1751
01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:49.333
<v Speaker 2>we don't prescribe these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to come in and we have to put </v>

1752
01:16:51.771 --> 01:16:53.390
<v Speaker 2>them in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I will say,</v>

1753
01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.880
<v Speaker 2>you know how when you go to the doctor </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1754
01:16:56.060 --> 01:16:58.220
<v Speaker 2>make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's always your dream.</v>

1755
01:16:58.221 --> 01:16:59.690
<v Speaker 2>Like just make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I could leave.</v>

1756
01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:02.600
<v Speaker 2>He made it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pain just went away.</v>

1757
01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:06.350
<v Speaker 2>They put lidacain up my nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I got the,</v>

1758
01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:06.740
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

1761

<v Speaker 1>I've had that stuff a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One time from a real bad sunburn.</v>

1762
01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I put Lidacain all over my back and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same feeling.</v>

1763
01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:20.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'll never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never do it again.</v>

1764
01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll just take the pain because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling that you get from La to Kansas,</v>

1765
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:26.270
<v Speaker 1>this gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird,</v>

1766
01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:29.420
<v Speaker 1>like he feels sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your heart feels sketchy,</v>

1767
01:17:29.421 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 1>like who you feel like you don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

1768
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:33.103
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably should but it's a lie to </v>

<v Speaker 1>king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you a very weird feeling.</v>

1770
01:17:37.701 --> 01:17:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was eating that night,</v>

1771
01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:40.184
<v Speaker 1>I went to a dinner and I was eating at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the steak place and I was like barely </v>

1772
01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:43.461
<v Speaker 1>hung.</v>

1773
01:17:43.461 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 1>why do I feel like shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized like,</v>

1774
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:47.203
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pumped that fucking lie to cane in </v>

1775
01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:49.584
<v Speaker 1>my notes.</v>

1776
01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.920
<v Speaker 2>It went in your system but it wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>

1777
01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.043
<v Speaker 1>I swallowed it could taste it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could taste it in the back because </v>

1778
01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:57.253
<v Speaker 1>they're pumping it up your nose because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I should've just them yank that stuff </v>

1779
01:18:00.081 --> 01:18:00.914
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just pull it out because it was really </v>

1780
01:18:02.001 --> 01:18:03.500
<v Speaker 1>no big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1781
01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:04.453
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have you convinced that you're </v>

1782
01:18:05.631 --> 01:18:07.260
<v Speaker 1>going to be in agony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1783
01:18:07.410 --> 01:18:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And different people have different pain</v>

1784
01:18:09.121 --> 01:18:12.150
<v Speaker 2>tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people are pussies.</v>

1785
01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1786
01:18:13.201 --> 01:18:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1787
01:18:13.830 --> 01:18:15.720
<v Speaker 2>And then others can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1788
01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:16.593
<v Speaker 2>can take it.</v>

1789
01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing about Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

1790
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:22.220
<v Speaker 1>doing Jujitsu for 20 plus years or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I've done.</v>

1791
01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:24.110
<v Speaker 1>You're always in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>

1792
01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you just get used to compartmentalizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1793
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:29.510
<v Speaker 1>oh my arm's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just accept it and deal with it.</v>

1794
01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:34.070
<v Speaker 1>Because if you took a pain pill every </v>
<v Speaker 1>time you were injured from Jujitsu.</v>

1795
01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:35.423

1797
01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I avoid Jujitsu.</v>

1798
01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:42.640
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1841
01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.460
<v Speaker 2>It have a little gift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1842
01:20:30.461 --> 01:20:32.490
<v Speaker 2>It's got a little gift to it and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>

1843
01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:34.830
<v Speaker 2>The shoes are so much better now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1844
01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:36.510
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ever put on a pair of converse?</v>

1845
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:37.920
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Taylors?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wear them all the time.</v>

1846
01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:41.760
<v Speaker 2>Imagine playing like imagine running and</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping in those.</v>

1847
01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Well there's an argument for you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you develop,</v>

1848
01:20:44.461 --> 01:20:45.294
<v Speaker 2>strengthen your feet like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're dealing with with these </v>

1849
01:20:48.090 --> 01:20:48.923
<v Speaker 2>basketball shoes is essentially like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big rubber cast and that these rubber </v>

1850
01:20:52.201 --> 01:20:55.560
<v Speaker 2>cast and all the cushioning and all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>jazz actually weakens your feet.</v>

1851
01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:00.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't buy it because I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this one pair of Nike's,</v>

1852
01:21:00.451 --> 01:21:01.284
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're air something but they got the </v>

1853
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:05.550
<v Speaker 2>full air so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're the only shoes I can run in.</v>

1854
01:21:05.730 --> 01:21:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Right you today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you wait,</v>

1855
01:21:07.221 --> 01:21:09.490
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two 40 to 50.</v>

1856
01:21:09.620 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so they make no mistake.</v>

1857
01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:14.760
<v Speaker 2>These guys are big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These guys six,</v>

1858
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:16.320
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,</v>

1859
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:19.290
<v Speaker 2>200 plus stomping and everything like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1860
01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:20.123
<v Speaker 2>I guess like especially you got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider basketball players are playing </v>

1861
01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.390
<v Speaker 2>how many days a week for how many </v>
<v Speaker 2>months?</v>

1862
01:21:24.391 --> 01:21:25.224
<v Speaker 2>A year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean and then in the off season and </v>

1863
01:21:26.731 --> 01:21:28.260
<v Speaker 2>it's not like they just lay around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get fat.</v>

1864
01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're worth me also.</v>

1865
01:21:30.150 --> 01:21:35.040
<v Speaker 2>And also you've got to look at how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money is invested in that player.</v>

1866
01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:35.820
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1867
01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:36.653
<v Speaker 2>like you just wanted Russell Westbrook </v>
<v Speaker 2>just sign for 200 and whatever million </v>

1868
01:21:41.011 --> 01:21:43.680
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You better believe his feet are going to</v>

1869
01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:44.514
<v Speaker 2>be taken care of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like whatever shoes he's playing in are </v>

1870
01:21:46.801 --> 01:21:51.630
<v Speaker 2>going to be the best thing possible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>his feet because we've got $40,000,000</v>

1871
01:21:51.631 --> 01:21:54.300
<v Speaker 2>a year invested in and gets a contract </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1872
01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Did the hose just start circling like </v>
<v Speaker 2>paltrow?</v>

1873
01:21:56.730 --> 01:21:57.600
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been there.</v>

1874
01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.553
<v Speaker 2>They've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1875
01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:01.980
<v Speaker 2>you get hoses around way before 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

1876
01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:03.913
<v Speaker 2>But once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once that happens they start thinking </v>

1877
01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:09.240
<v Speaker 2>all I need is one sperm to crack the egg</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm good.</v>

1878
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:10.253
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of gals out there like </v>

1879
01:22:11.071 --> 01:22:12.810
<v Speaker 2>that back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1880
01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:14.160
<v Speaker 2>What was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 eight,</v>

1881
01:22:14.161 --> 01:22:14.994
<v Speaker 2>89.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to play ball at valley college </v>

1882
01:22:17.221 --> 01:22:18.600
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like pick up all.</v>

1883
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:20.250
<v Speaker 2>But it was high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were good,</v>

1884
01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.113
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played with guys who had been in like </v>

1885
01:22:22.740 --> 01:22:26.250
<v Speaker 2>d one who had played division one league</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

1886
01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:28.103
<v Speaker 2>The NBA Rehab was in Van Nuys and on </v>
<v Speaker 2>weekends they would come to the gym and </v>

1887
01:22:32.821 --> 01:22:33.654
<v Speaker 2>they play ball with us right now I got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to know a few players and this one guy </v>

1888
01:22:37.021 --> 01:22:38.720
<v Speaker 2>told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was an 80,</v>

1889
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:39.810
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>88,</v>

1890
01:22:39.811 --> 01:22:40.644
<v Speaker 2>89.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said an NBA kid is worth 100 grand a </v>

1891
01:22:44.221 --> 01:22:47.600
<v Speaker 2>year for 18 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1892
01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.160
<v Speaker 2>do use checks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poke holes in the condoms.</v>

1893
01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:52.470
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't trust any of them.</v>

1894
01:22:53.090 --> 01:22:56.550
<v Speaker 2>And that was then with that kind of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was back when,</v>

1895
01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:59.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$5 million was a huge contract.</v>

1896
01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.413
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1897
01:23:00.690 --> 01:23:05.680
<v Speaker 2>so you can only imagine now because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems fairly inexpensive,</v>

1898
01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:08.080
<v Speaker 3>will take care of a child.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

1899
01:23:08.081 --> 01:23:10.450
<v Speaker 3>in [inaudible] 89,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was back in [inaudible] 89.</v>

1900
01:23:10.451 --> 01:23:14.140
<v Speaker 3>So now that that hundred grand is </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably half a million probably.</v>

1901
01:23:14.141 --> 01:23:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you look,</v>

1902
01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the average salary in the NBA,</v>

1903
01:23:18.341 --> 01:23:21.910
<v Speaker 3>including the guys on the bench is like </v>
<v Speaker 3>two point 3 million.</v>

1904
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:22.983
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that funny too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when you think about like say </v>

1905
01:23:25.181 --> 01:23:27.460
<v Speaker 3>the average person makes like what 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>grand,</v>

1906
01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:30.850
<v Speaker 3>60 grand a year is that minimum wage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Minimum wage.</v>

1907
01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Middle class was middle middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 60,</v>

1908
01:23:33.221 --> 01:23:36.250
<v Speaker 3>70 here in California is I think across </v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

1909
01:23:36.251 --> 01:23:37.084
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like 40 something so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that this baby would live </v>

1910
01:23:43.031 --> 01:23:43.870
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1911
01:23:43.871 --> 01:23:44.251
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1912
01:23:44.251 --> 01:23:44.670
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1913
01:23:44.670 --> 01:23:45.720
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1914
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:49.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy doesn't even know the kid.</v>

1915
01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's taking care of it.</v>

1916
01:23:51.191 --> 01:23:53.200
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even know her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

1917
01:23:53.230 --> 01:23:54.063
<v Speaker 3>if he has to be child support,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're not know you're playing </v>

1918
01:23:55.991 --> 01:23:56.770
<v Speaker 3>child support.</v>

1919
01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Like lavish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lavish.</v>

1920
01:23:58.710 --> 01:23:59.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

1921
01:23:59.590 --> 01:24:00.423
<v Speaker 3>You like the average person likes if the</v>
<v Speaker 3>average family is existing off of 50 to </v>

1922
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 3>$70,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year,</v>

1923
01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.180
<v Speaker 3>but this woman wants a half a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a super baby.</v>

1924
01:24:10.270 --> 01:24:11.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>

1925
01:24:11.381 --> 01:24:12.214
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we have these weird rules </v>

1926
01:24:13.301 --> 01:24:15.040
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well how lean minute,</v>

1927
01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:19.810
<v Speaker 3>why is that the case?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's what dad makes right now to</v>

1928
01:24:19.830 --> 01:24:20.663
<v Speaker 3>what dad makes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean you're not asking someone to </v>

1929
01:24:22.241 --> 01:24:25.930
<v Speaker 3>pay for the kids living expenses when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're asking someone to keep.</v>

1930
01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Keep a kid in the lap of luxury and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mom's going to buy a car and and get</v>

1931
01:24:30.571 --> 01:24:33.490
<v Speaker 3>her nails did and that's the fight that </v>
<v Speaker 3>dads have.</v>

1932
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:35.620
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the dads were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well just send me the bill.</v>

1933
01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Send me the bill for private school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does this here,</v>

1934
01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.300
<v Speaker 3>Antonio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you say his name?</v>

1935
01:24:40.301 --> 01:24:41.134
<v Speaker 3>Marty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marty just had number 14 is $3 million </v>

1936
01:24:43.541 --> 01:24:44.374
<v Speaker 3>dollar deal from the colts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately used it to settle a child </v>

1937
01:24:46.991 --> 01:24:51.160
<v Speaker 3>support dispute with a baby mama to </v>
<v Speaker 3>avoid possible arrest in the process.</v>

1938
01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Cromarty was delinquent on child support</v>
<v Speaker 3>payments to Rosa Meta.</v>

1939
01:24:55.931 --> 01:24:57.760
<v Speaker 3>Pierre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like a lovely lady.</v>

1940
01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:00.100
<v Speaker 3>The mother of Alonzo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his oldest child,</v>

<v Speaker 3>AK number one of 13 kids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 to 14.</v>

<v Speaker 3>per month.</v>

1944
01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:11.140
<v Speaker 3>That's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually reasonable.</v>

1945
01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:13.390
<v Speaker 3>Now multiply that by 14.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>

1946
01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Tubes tied to the last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I still had a kid.</v>

01:25:32.021 --> 01:25:35.200
<v Speaker 3>boycott of football and so people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>mad at the players will play in.</v>

1954
01:25:35.201 --> 01:25:38.890
<v Speaker 3>It's like that's why you got to play </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you got 14 kids.</v>

1955
01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.290
<v Speaker 3>Capital boycott of football was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1956
01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:42.550
<v Speaker 3>What does that have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>transport?</v>

1957
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1958
01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:44.913
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of black people boycotting </v>

1959
01:25:47.951 --> 01:25:51.130
<v Speaker 3>football and then people saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why did the players play like,</v>

1960
01:25:51.131 --> 01:25:51.821
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>screw them,</v>

1961
01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:53.910
<v Speaker 3>but everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every black player,</v>

1962
01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.280
<v Speaker 3>the nfl just refused to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1963
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:57.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that ain't gonna happen.</v>

1964
01:25:58.420 --> 01:25:59.253
<v Speaker 3>They need their paychecks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole national anthem thing along </v>

1965
01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:04.093
<v Speaker 3>football is very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like football players should be </v>

1966
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.280
<v Speaker 3>playing football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>UFC fighters don't have to fucking stand</v>

1967
01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:11.114
<v Speaker 3>there with their hand over their heart </v>
<v Speaker 3>to show allegiance and to show you know </v>

1968
01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:15.913
<v Speaker 3>what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically asking someone to be </v>

1969
01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:19.010
<v Speaker 3>domesticated.</v>

1970
01:26:19.650 --> 01:26:20.483
<v Speaker 3>You're asking them to follow the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth has come out like players </v>

1971
01:26:23.931 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 3>didn't do it until I was it 10 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 3>or something like that.</v>

1972
01:26:27.141 --> 01:26:27.974
<v Speaker 3>When the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the government started paying the </v>

1973
01:26:29.901 --> 01:26:33.330
<v Speaker 3>NFL to have them do it because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1974
01:26:33.331 --> 01:26:34.610
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that whole thing.</v>

1975
01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:35.660
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1976
01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:39.830
<v Speaker 3>It's weird because the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're asking them to be,</v>

1977
01:26:40.580 --> 01:26:42.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to,</v>

1978
01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:43.630
<v Speaker 3>to give in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1979
01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 3>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're asking them to follow the rule.</v>

1980
01:26:46.650 --> 01:26:47.430
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

1981
01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:50.750
<v Speaker 3>my problem with it and I called it the </v>
<v Speaker 3>misdirection.</v>

1982
01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.390
<v Speaker 3>The protest never had to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flag.</v>

1983
01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.550
<v Speaker 3>It was about the protests had to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>cops and the treatment and it was just,</v>

1984
01:26:58.551 --> 01:26:59.384
<v Speaker 3>he just did it at that point because </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a powerful statement to do it at </v>

1985
01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:04.400
<v Speaker 3>that point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1986
01:27:04.401 --> 01:27:05.234
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now the misdirection to changing up </v>

1987
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:11.540
<v Speaker 3>the topic is making it about the flag </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's like,</v>

1988
01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:13.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not what they are.</v>

1989
01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:16.930
<v Speaker 3>They will never protesting the flag or </v>
<v Speaker 3>veterans or,</v>

1990
01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:18.740
<v Speaker 3>or Americans or and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

1991
01:27:18.741 --> 01:27:20.870
<v Speaker 3>when you get into those rules of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>flag,</v>

1992
01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:25.490
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to have the flag on </v>
<v Speaker 3>tee shirts or bikinis or hats or,</v>

1993
01:27:25.491 --> 01:27:28.880
<v Speaker 3>or a million other things we sell with </v>
<v Speaker 3>the flag on it.</v>

1994
01:27:28.881 --> 01:27:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Like if you want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>respecting the flag,</v>

1995
01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:34.520
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't do any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You summed it up.</v>

1996
01:27:34.521 --> 01:27:36.200
<v Speaker 3>I mean it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about control,</v>

1997
01:27:36.201 --> 01:27:37.034
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing with these freedom </v>

1998
01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:40.230
<v Speaker 3>of speech marches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where?</v>

1999
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:41.383
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's okay to have freedom of speech as </v>

2000
01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:44.030
<v Speaker 3>long as you're saying something I agree </v>
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>

2001
01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.093
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the problem with this whole </v>

2002
01:27:46.371 --> 01:27:47.204
<v Speaker 3>kaepernick thing and said it's not an </v>
<v Speaker 3>effective form of protest too because </v>

2003
01:27:50.721 --> 01:27:52.760
<v Speaker 3>it's getting people pissed off for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong reasons.</v>

2004
01:27:52.761 --> 01:27:55.300
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was people thinking that you're,</v>

2005
01:27:55.301 --> 01:27:56.134
<v Speaker 3>you're protesting America itself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you move to Canada and then </v>

2006
01:27:59.561 --> 01:28:00.394
<v Speaker 3>people start getting crazy about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to set what he's trying to do or </v>

2007
01:28:03.561 --> 01:28:04.394
<v Speaker 3>what he was trying to do was protest all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these unarmed people getting shot by </v>

2008
01:28:08.061 --> 01:28:10.070
<v Speaker 3>cops and so he takes a need for that.</v>

2009
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:12.650
<v Speaker 3>But the national anthem doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit to do with those cops.</v>

2010
01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:13.973
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just became a thing of when one guy </v>

2011
01:28:15.471 --> 01:28:19.940
<v Speaker 3>did it and he did it as a protest and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said he wanted to start the conversation</v>

2012
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:25.450
<v Speaker 3>and then the conversation got lost and </v>
<v Speaker 3>now the conversation is completely lost.</v>

2013
01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Then the argument is a completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>different topic and you know that.</v>

2014
01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:34.940
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you said control is definitely part</v>

2015
01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:36.470
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with the universities,</v>

2016
01:28:36.471 --> 01:28:39.080
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With free speech on the universities and</v>

2017
01:28:39.081 --> 01:28:41.030
<v Speaker 3>you know when you look at a school like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley,</v>

2018
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:43.070
<v Speaker 3>Berkeley had a reasonable arguments like</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2019
01:28:43.071 --> 01:28:43.904
<v Speaker 3>when we bring one of these radical </v>
<v Speaker 3>speakers here and it costs a million </v>

2020
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:49.610
<v Speaker 3>dollars for security,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to pay that?</v>

2021
01:28:50.230 --> 01:28:52.370
<v Speaker 3>So like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to pay it,</v>

2022
01:28:52.371 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 3>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll let you talk,</v>

2023
01:28:53.451 --> 01:28:54.284
<v Speaker 3>but if nobody's going to pay the million</v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars for security and we can't have </v>

2024
01:28:57.081 --> 01:28:59.510
<v Speaker 3>these radical speakers here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of,</v>

2025
01:28:59.511 --> 01:29:00.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem with that article is they've</v>

2026
01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:01.913
<v Speaker 3>had those speakers there forever and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then when they started having these </v>

2027
01:29:04.921 --> 01:29:08.820
<v Speaker 3>antifa protests and they also start </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporting these antifa protests,</v>

2028
01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:09.654
<v Speaker 3>that's a big issue.</v>

2029
01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:10.593
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they stopped having cops go after the </v>

2030
01:29:12.031 --> 01:29:12.864
<v Speaker 3>Antifa people and the Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the literally the chief of police was </v>

2031
01:29:15.781 --> 01:29:19.710
<v Speaker 3>literally telling people the mayor was </v>
<v Speaker 3>telling the police to stand down and let</v>

2032
01:29:19.711 --> 01:29:22.110
<v Speaker 3>these people protest and not just </v>
<v Speaker 3>protests.</v>

2033
01:29:22.111 --> 01:29:24.090
<v Speaker 3>They were being very violent and </v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking things.</v>

2034
01:29:24.091 --> 01:29:27.240
<v Speaker 3>And you're setting up a reaction action </v>
<v Speaker 3>event,</v>

2035
01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you have something like that where</v>

2036
01:29:29.581 --> 01:29:32.490
<v Speaker 3>people are breaking windows and light </v>
<v Speaker 3>things on fire or doing whatever they're</v>

2037
01:29:32.491 --> 01:29:33.324
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have people that say </v>

2038
01:29:34.111 --> 01:29:34.944
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people were going to meet there </v>

2039
01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:39.630
<v Speaker 3>and we're going to protest the anti </v>
<v Speaker 3>protest people.</v>

2040
01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.230
<v Speaker 3>And then next thing you know you've got </v>
<v Speaker 3>a real issue in your hand.</v>

2041
01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:43.950
<v Speaker 3>But that's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2042
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:44.903
<v Speaker 3>that's where we're at now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where everything has to be that big an </v>

2043
01:29:47.491 --> 01:29:48.900
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2044
01:29:48.901 --> 01:29:51.780
<v Speaker 3>Twenty years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago at Berkeley,</v>

2045
01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:52.883
<v Speaker 3>you could have had a speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a right wing speaker that the school </v>

2046
01:29:55.781 --> 01:29:56.550
<v Speaker 3>didn't agree with.</v>

2047
01:29:56.550 --> 01:30:00.570
<v Speaker 3>It would have been some protesters </v>
<v Speaker 3>outside just not even two years ago,</v>

2048
01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:02.460
<v Speaker 3>but then it became,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this,</v>

2049
01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.200
<v Speaker 3>this is a social media effect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2050
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:05.303
<v Speaker 3>The speaker brings his social media </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing and he needs to stir it up to </v>

2051
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:13.620
<v Speaker 3>build his social media side and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people come and then the other side</v>

2052
01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:14.483
<v Speaker 3>gets mad just what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they bring their and then you bring </v>

2053
01:30:17.341 --> 01:30:22.200
<v Speaker 3>the angry groups from both sides are </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to meet and then they're like,</v>

2054
01:30:22.201 --> 01:30:23.034
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now it's because it makes the whole </v>

2055
01:30:24.901 --> 01:30:26.520
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like promoting a fight.</v>

2056
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:28.530
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like promoting a fight.</v>

2057
01:30:28.531 --> 01:30:31.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's one thing if two guys get</v>
<v Speaker 3>into a fight,</v>

2058
01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:34.320
<v Speaker 3>but if you promote that fight for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>month,</v>

2059
01:30:34.590 --> 01:30:36.150
<v Speaker 3>three months,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six months ahead,</v>

2060
01:30:36.390 --> 01:30:39.210
<v Speaker 3>that fight is going to be huge and this </v>
<v Speaker 3>is the same thing.</v>

2061
01:30:39.211 --> 01:30:40.740
<v Speaker 3>They promote these speakers.</v>

2062
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:42.223
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2063
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:46.350
<v Speaker 3>the protest is part of the publicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2064
01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:47.603
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so well their speakers and then there's </v>

2065
01:30:48.991 --> 01:30:50.460
<v Speaker 3>people that are provocateurs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2066
01:30:50.461 --> 01:30:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2067

<v Speaker 3>that's a better term.</v>

2068
01:30:53.011 --> 01:30:56.220
<v Speaker 3>So I shouldn't say speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should say provocateurs.</v>

2069
01:30:57.060 --> 01:30:57.893
<v Speaker 3>Shapiro is a speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben Shapiro's and intellectual and he's </v>

2070

<v Speaker 3>a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got.</v>

2071
01:31:01.561 --> 01:31:04.110
<v Speaker 3>Some are very solid arguments whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>you agree with them or not.</v>

2072
01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:04.973
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got some real facts to go with his </v>

2073
01:31:06.931 --> 01:31:07.764
<v Speaker 3>arguments and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a junior whereas a yarmulke and </v>

2074

<v Speaker 3>people calling them a Nazi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's like this whole punch Nazis </v>

<v Speaker 3>it's just like we were talking about </v>

2077
01:31:21.001 --> 01:31:22.260
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to gun control,</v>

2078

<v Speaker 3>it's teams you're on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm on team left wing,</v>

2080
01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:31.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm on team right wing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I support the Conservatives and Potus,</v>

2081
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:33.330
<v Speaker 3>like the people that are calling trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>potus,</v>

2084
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.821
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2085
01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2086
01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:37.790
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's fucking trump?</v>

2087
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:41.220
<v Speaker 3>It's Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there's ever an argument,</v>

2088
01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.083
<v Speaker 3>this is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fucking a guy who was the host of </v>

2089
01:31:43.771 --> 01:31:47.340
<v Speaker 3>the apprentice is now the guy you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>calling Joe Joe.</v>

2090
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:49.410
<v Speaker 3>You're disrespecting the White House </v>
<v Speaker 3>differences.</v>

2091
01:31:49.550 --> 01:31:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>potents.</v>

2092
01:31:51.390 --> 01:31:53.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like literally like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pope.</v>

2093
01:31:53.350 --> 01:31:55.560
<v Speaker 3>He gets to this almost like paypal </v>
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>

2094
01:31:55.561 --> 01:31:56.650
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2095
01:31:56.940 --> 01:32:01.120
<v Speaker 3>these are the same people who said the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing about Barack Obama.</v>

2096
01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.073
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2097
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.690
<v Speaker 3>last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2098
01:32:04.050 --> 01:32:09.050
<v Speaker 3>But the president has never been </v>
<v Speaker 3>disgraced or insulted.</v>

2099
01:32:09.371 --> 01:32:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Like really they insulted when he wore </v>
<v Speaker 3>tennis shoes.</v>

2100
01:32:13.570 --> 01:32:14.403
<v Speaker 3>We played that when Obama was 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was the end of America with </v>

2101
01:32:20.051 --> 01:32:23.260
<v Speaker 3>respect to the office for off color </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothing.</v>

2102
01:32:23.860 --> 01:32:24.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a gang color.</v>

2103
01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:31.940
<v Speaker 3>And then Michelle Obama wore sleeveless </v>
<v Speaker 3>dress and I think,</v>

2104
01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:33.430
<v Speaker 3>I think that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2105
01:32:33.610 --> 01:32:37.060
<v Speaker 3>didn't Alex Jones do something recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that Michelle Obama was a man,</v>

2106
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:39.130
<v Speaker 3>like proof that Michelle Obama was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2107
01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:42.760
<v Speaker 3>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on some shit today.</v>

2108
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:44.800
<v Speaker 3>They'll do all that shit with Michelle </v>
<v Speaker 3>ain't in the room.</v>

2109
01:32:45.250 --> 01:32:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2110
01:32:47.641 --> 01:32:48.474
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2111
01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.100
<v Speaker 3>It was easy to put down with trump to </v>
<v Speaker 3>call pro football players.</v>

2112
01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Sons of bitches from Huntsville,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alabama.</v>

2113
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's try it on the sideline.</v>

2114
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:57.340
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A few of them standing next to you,</v>

2115
01:32:57.370 --> 01:32:58.470
<v Speaker 3>sons of bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2116
01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:01.030
<v Speaker 3>fire the sons of bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're fired.</v>

2117
01:33:01.330 --> 01:33:03.760
<v Speaker 3>They shouldn't have them fucking stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the national anthem.</v>

2118
01:33:03.761 --> 01:33:04.594
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to have a national anthem </v>

2119
01:33:05.981 --> 01:33:07.870
<v Speaker 3>for a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you saying?</v>

2120
01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:08.441
<v Speaker 3>Are you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2121
01:33:08.441 --> 01:33:09.274
<v Speaker 3>is this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2122
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.841
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

2123
01:33:09.841 --> 01:33:13.030
<v Speaker 3>you're rallying up patriotism at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>sporting event.</v>

2124
01:33:13.150 --> 01:33:15.940
<v Speaker 3>Sporting events are supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>entertaining.</v>

2125
01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:19.120
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to remove us from all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>our daily bullshit,</v>

2126
01:33:19.121 --> 01:33:20.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it's going to be entertaining,</v>

2127
01:33:20.621 --> 01:33:22.610
<v Speaker 3>be entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they did they.</v>

2128
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's okay.</v>

2129
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:27.100
<v Speaker 3>They did a thing this past week at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rams game.</v>

2130
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:30.520
<v Speaker 3>During the national anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people were in the beer line?</v>

2131
01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:33.280
<v Speaker 3>How many guys were taking a piss?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2132
01:33:33.281 --> 01:33:34.360
<v Speaker 3>How many you need?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2133
01:33:34.361 --> 01:33:38.010
<v Speaker 3>It's not like those guys not taking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody stopped anyway.</v>

2134
01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.670
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2135
01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:43.600
<v Speaker 3>not like everybody stopped and turned </v>
<v Speaker 3>and held their hand over their heart.</v>

2136
01:33:43.601 --> 01:33:43.991
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2137
01:33:43.991 --> 01:33:44.824
<v Speaker 3>well I got my Dick in my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Literally literally into the bathroom </v>

2138
01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:50.890
<v Speaker 3>between people's assets for pissing </v>
<v Speaker 3>during the national anthem.</v>

2139
01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:55.891
<v Speaker 3>If you tell them they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just the protest is ineffective,</v>

2140
01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:57.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting on your knees,</v>

2141
01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.233
<v Speaker 3>we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just causes too much controversy and </v>

2142
01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:01.090
<v Speaker 3>here's the other problem with it.</v>

2143
01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:06.040
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't stop anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't stop coc cops or do anything.</v>

2144
01:34:06.041 --> 01:34:06.874
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even shed light on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just points to you and people start </v>

2145
01:34:10.541 --> 01:34:11.261
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2146
01:34:11.261 --> 01:34:13.150
<v Speaker 3>what is it that you're protesting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well we're,</v>

2147
01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:15.490
<v Speaker 3>we're mad at you because you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>standing up for the national anthem.</v>

2148
01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:18.470
<v Speaker 3>It creates all this noise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

2149
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:19.783
<v Speaker 3>that's the part I called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>misdirection because initially when </v>

2150
01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:24.820
<v Speaker 3>Kaepernick did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it had some meaning.</v>

2151
01:34:24.821 --> 01:34:25.654
<v Speaker 3>It had some meaning to him and it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>about starting a conversation and when </v>

2152
01:34:28.781 --> 01:34:32.440
<v Speaker 3>it became this bigger thing like you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about when it became this,</v>

2153
01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're anti American,</v>

2154
01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.040
<v Speaker 3>your impact troops or blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

2155
01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:38.680
<v Speaker 3>Now it's lost its effectiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2156
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:39.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to do something else because </v>

2157
01:34:40.601 --> 01:34:42.010
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

2158
01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:45.130
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't even know.</v>

2159
01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:47.470
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know why you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2160
01:34:47.471 --> 01:34:50.650
<v Speaker 3>but they hate you for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like doing it now too.</v>

2161
01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Why are you doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do it because I hate puppies.</v>

2162
01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

2163
01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Fuck is everybody's doing it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're mad at trump.</v>

2164
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:58.123
<v Speaker 3>Shit about the NFL.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're getting just giant groups of </v>

2165
01:34:59.811 --> 01:35:01.790
<v Speaker 3>people doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much more so than before.</v>

2166
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

2167
01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.431
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2168
01:35:03.431 --> 01:35:04.950
<v Speaker 2>it's lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its effectiveness,</v>

2169
01:35:04.951 --> 01:35:06.270
<v Speaker 2>its losses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>importance,</v>

2170
01:35:06.271 --> 01:35:07.890
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the players,</v>

2171
01:35:07.891 --> 01:35:09.480
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the players get caught in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle,</v>

2172
01:35:09.481 --> 01:35:10.314
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you do have a thing where </v>

2173
01:35:11.011 --> 01:35:11.844
<v Speaker 2>your team says you can't do it or you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be fined or you're going to </v>

2174
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:15.303
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The NBA said that it's against the </v>

2175
01:35:18.151 --> 01:35:19.950
<v Speaker 2>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the MBA,</v>

2176
01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:20.873
<v Speaker 2>the MBA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not anybody doing that in the NBA </v>

2177
01:35:22.471 --> 01:35:23.590
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2178
01:35:23.700 --> 01:35:24.533
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2179
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:25.703
<v Speaker 2>well they hadn't started playing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The NBA just started this week in </v>

2180
01:35:27.961 --> 01:35:31.130
<v Speaker 2>preseason before it started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

2181
01:35:31.590 --> 01:35:32.423
<v Speaker 2>in the past the NBA did things like they</v>
<v Speaker 2>warn 'em I can't breathe t shirts and </v>

2182
01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:42.660
<v Speaker 2>they've done things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NBA players,</v>

2183
01:35:42.661 --> 01:35:46.740
<v Speaker 2>NBA players are a bit more sophisticated</v>
<v Speaker 2>and their protests.</v>

2184
01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:50.640
<v Speaker 2>And I think there are also a more united</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's head trauma,</v>

2185
01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:51.593
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2186
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:54.950
<v Speaker 3>Probably a big part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've also been encouraged,</v>

2187
01:35:54.951 --> 01:35:56.150
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to speak out,</v>

2188
01:35:56.300 --> 01:36:00.890
<v Speaker 3>whereas I don't know that the nfl </v>
<v Speaker 3>players are also encouraged to speak out</v>

2189
01:36:00.891 --> 01:36:02.270
<v Speaker 3>in public.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if topics,</v>

2190
01:36:02.271 --> 01:36:03.104
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2191
01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:03.963
<v Speaker 2>basketball players with necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraged to speak out or the big </v>

2192
01:36:06.491 --> 01:36:09.550
<v Speaker 2>difference with the NBA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the players have bigger than the team.</v>

2193
01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:11.440
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2194
01:36:11.530 --> 01:36:12.440
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're huge fan.</v>

2195
01:36:12.670 --> 01:36:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Huge stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:36:14.141 --> 01:36:17.080
<v Speaker 3>So you have like Lebron is bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cavaliers.</v>

2197
01:36:17.081 --> 01:36:22.060
<v Speaker 3>Curry is bigger than the warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we did you bomb at the president,</v>

2198

<v Speaker 3>happens to be a reality show host.</v>

<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent vice president,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why the hell?</v>

2213
01:37:02.441 --> 01:37:04.690
<v Speaker 3>Not that Melania can barely speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>English.</v>

2214
01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:08.050
<v Speaker 3>They're talking about immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So closing the border like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>porn.</v>

<v Speaker 2>But apparently he did this sub kind of </v>

2220
01:37:18.770 --> 01:37:23.110
<v Speaker 2>top 10 list about Melania and if one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the jokes was she has no</v>

2221
01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:28.160
<v Speaker 3>first language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2222
01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.240
<v Speaker 3>that's a joke that Russell Peters said </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Yoshi,</v>

2223
01:37:31.890 --> 01:37:34.080
<v Speaker 3>Yoshi Kobiashi Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was saying.</v>

2224
01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:34.740
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

2225
01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:36.420
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yoshi speaks terrible English.</v>

2226
01:37:36.421 --> 01:37:39.630
<v Speaker 3>But when you talk to people that speak </v>
<v Speaker 3>Japanese is Japanese sucks too.</v>

2227
01:37:40.030 --> 01:37:44.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have no real language.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2228
01:37:44.730 --> 01:37:49.260
<v Speaker 3>it's the whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this football thing is very strange.</v>

2229
01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.153
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange because now they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they kicked these two high school kids </v>

2230
01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:56.880
<v Speaker 3>right off the team because they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>following their heroes.</v>

2231
01:37:57.130 --> 01:37:57.931
<v Speaker 3>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it,</v>

2232
01:37:57.931 --> 01:38:00.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take a knee to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2233
01:38:00.150 --> 01:38:00.983
<v Speaker 3>you'd taken a knee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should at least be able to write an </v>

2234
01:38:02.371 --> 01:38:05.150
<v Speaker 3>essay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell me why you're taking a nice son.</v>

2235
01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:06.233
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you got to know the difference </v>

2236
01:38:06.901 --> 01:38:07.734
<v Speaker 3>between Your y o u r and while you </v>
<v Speaker 3>apostrophe r e and you also got to be </v>

2237
01:38:13.441 --> 01:38:15.000
<v Speaker 3>starting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2238
01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:15.710
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2239
01:38:15.710 --> 01:38:18.330
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if the starting quarterback takes a</v>

2240
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:21.780
<v Speaker 3>knee,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he does a lot more latitude than,</v>

2241
01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:24.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a second string defensive end.</v>

2242
01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:25.590
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2243
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:27.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if trust me,</v>

2244
01:38:27.711 --> 01:38:28.400
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

2245
01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:29.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2246
01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:32.790
<v Speaker 3>Aaron Rodgers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if Dak Prescott was taken a knee,</v>

2247
01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:34.970
<v Speaker 3>this be a whole different conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2248
01:38:35.670 --> 01:38:38.250
<v Speaker 3>Kaepernick wasn't a big star player.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

2249
01:38:38.251 --> 01:38:39.084
<v Speaker 3>but he fell off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fell off because of the controversy </v>

2250
01:38:41.701 --> 01:38:44.070
<v Speaker 3>and all the halo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it was he,</v>

2251
01:38:44.370 --> 01:38:45.203
<v Speaker 3>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had started falling off before that </v>

2252
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.590
<v Speaker 3>so that we know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2253
01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:50.940
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what I mean.</v>

2254
01:38:50.941 --> 01:38:53.160
<v Speaker 3>But one of the arguments is in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is true.</v>

2255
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:56.880
<v Speaker 3>He's a lot better than a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>quarterbacks who have jobs.</v>

2256
01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:59.730
<v Speaker 3>See that was the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They said no,</v>

2257
01:38:59.731 --> 01:39:02.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not a conspiracy because of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>protests.</v>

2258
01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:03.083
<v Speaker 3>But then they showed the numbers of like</v>
<v Speaker 3>various backup quarterbacks who were in </v>

2259
01:39:06.631 --> 01:39:10.620
<v Speaker 3>the league and he's better than a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and in one of the owners,</v>

2260
01:39:10.621 --> 01:39:14.160
<v Speaker 3>I think it was Baltimore where the coach</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted him and the owner was like,</v>

2261
01:39:14.161 --> 01:39:15.960
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want him because of the protest.</v>

2262
01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.093
<v Speaker 3>So it became a thing of where they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said he's not blackballed because </v>

2263
01:39:20.581 --> 01:39:22.440
<v Speaker 3>of the protest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then it came out.</v>

2264
01:39:22.441 --> 01:39:23.274
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was blackballed because of the </v>

2265
01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:25.104
<v Speaker 3>protest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And again that that's one of those </v>

2266
01:39:26.791 --> 01:39:29.760
<v Speaker 3>things where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know this with any athlete,</v>

2267
01:39:29.761 --> 01:39:33.270
<v Speaker 3>like your complaints depend on where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>are in your career.</v>

2268
01:39:33.271 --> 01:39:34.104
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tom Brady even said the president was </v>

2269
01:39:36.151 --> 01:39:38.880
<v Speaker 3>divisive and when Tom Brady said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody went,</v>

2270
01:39:38.881 --> 01:39:40.020
<v Speaker 3>oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

2271
01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.510
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not taking the knee yet,</v>

2272
01:39:41.511 --> 01:39:42.690
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're hooking arms.</v>

2273
01:39:42.691 --> 01:39:43.524
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2274
01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:47.910
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's arms in unity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because when trump spoke out against the</v>

2275
01:39:47.911 --> 01:39:48.870
<v Speaker 3>nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now he,</v>

2276
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:50.770
<v Speaker 3>he's aiming at their money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2277
01:39:50.771 --> 01:39:51.604
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when he's telling fans not to go to the </v>

2278
01:39:52.891 --> 01:39:55.200
<v Speaker 3>games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like those owners love him,</v>

2279
01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.490
<v Speaker 3>but now they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2280
01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:58.030
<v Speaker 3>hold the fuck up now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2281
01:39:58.080 --> 01:39:58.913
<v Speaker 3>That's money out of our pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody saying hold the fuck up now </v>

2282
01:40:01.201 --> 01:40:02.310
<v Speaker 3>because it is working.</v>

2283
01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:03.203
<v Speaker 3>Direct TV just offered this gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 3>refund for their nfl package because </v>

2284
01:40:07.741 --> 01:40:09.630
<v Speaker 3>people are pissed off that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a knee.</v>

2285
01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:12.740
<v Speaker 3>You're paying to see football.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucks.</v>

2286
01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:15.390
<v Speaker 3>You're not paying to see people stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>with their hand over their heart.</v>

2287
01:40:15.391 --> 01:40:18.000
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the here's the solution.</v>

2288
01:40:18.210 --> 01:40:19.043
<v Speaker 3>Take all that shit out of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want the players to be compliant </v>

2289
01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:26.580
<v Speaker 3>and submissive when you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're asking the wrong thing.</v>

2290
01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:27.653
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about super athletes is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is essentially a group combat </v>

2291
01:40:31.111 --> 01:40:32.490
<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a football.</v>

2292
01:40:32.491 --> 01:40:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2293
01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:35.710
<v Speaker 3>and if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2294
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:36.900
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're.</v>

2295
01:40:36.901 --> 01:40:37.734
<v Speaker 3>You're telling them to keep their job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to put their hand over their </v>

2296
01:40:40.681 --> 01:40:42.300
<v Speaker 3>heart and standards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain position.</v>

2297
01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:43.313
<v Speaker 3>That seems very fucking bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fox Fox said that they're going to stop </v>

2298
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:49.830
<v Speaker 3>televising the national anthem and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was pointed out.</v>

2299
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:52.580
<v Speaker 3>Well you didn't use to televise the </v>
<v Speaker 3>national anthem like you.</v>

2300
01:40:52.590 --> 01:40:54.130
<v Speaker 3>You didn't tell buys it until two</v>

2301
01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:54.963
<v Speaker 2>weeks ago when it became controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before that you will be listening to </v>

2302
01:40:57.911 --> 01:41:01.100
<v Speaker 2>those three guys in the studio right up </v>
<v Speaker 2>til the kickoff.</v>

2303
01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:04.750
<v Speaker 2>You and then the only time they televise</v>
<v Speaker 2>it it if it was like Whitney Houston was</v>

2304
01:41:04.751 --> 01:41:08.120
<v Speaker 2>singing it where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a big deal.</v>

2305
01:41:08.170 --> 01:41:08.570
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2306
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:09.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of no anthem in sports </v>

2307
01:41:13.341 --> 01:41:14.174
<v Speaker 1>because I like sports to be split.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things I love about the </v>

2308
01:41:16.821 --> 01:41:19.220
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's no national anthems you don't</v>

2309
01:41:19.221 --> 01:41:22.460
<v Speaker 1>have to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they often say the Brazilian national</v>

2310
01:41:22.461 --> 01:41:23.294
<v Speaker 1>anthem when Josie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those fighting or the American </v>

2311
01:41:25.071 --> 01:41:27.100
<v Speaker 1>national anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Chris Weidman's fighting,</v>

2312
01:41:27.110 --> 01:41:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just go right to the fight.</v>

2313
01:41:30.291 --> 01:41:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Here's the main event of the evening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

2314
01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:33.620
<v Speaker 1>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2315
01:41:33.621 --> 01:41:34.454
<v Speaker 1>blah blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if someone wants to make some sort </v>

2316
01:41:37.281 --> 01:41:40.940
<v Speaker 1>of a political statement or stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do that in an interview.</v>

2317
01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:45.710
<v Speaker 1>That interview will be judged based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content of whatever the conversation</v>

2318
01:41:45.711 --> 01:41:46.544
<v Speaker 1>is and that's how it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This weird sort of way where someone </v>

2319
01:41:49.641 --> 01:41:54.290
<v Speaker 1>taking a knee is supposed to protest </v>
<v Speaker 1>cops shooting people,</v>

2320
01:41:54.291 --> 01:41:56.360
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't say that while you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the knee,</v>

2321
01:41:56.361 --> 01:42:00.140
<v Speaker 1>you're taking a knee during the anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The anthem is supposed to be all of us.</v>

2322
01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:05.030
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again as a team like the United</v>

2323
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:07.700
<v Speaker 1>States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the seahawks versus the dolphins.</v>

2324
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Put all that aside for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all in this together.</v>

2325
01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:11.593
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea.</v>

2326
01:42:11.650 --> 01:42:15.140
<v Speaker 2>I understand why he did it and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand why he did it then because it</v>

2327
01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:19.420
<v Speaker 2>was the way to call attention to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now that's lost.</v>

2328
01:42:19.421 --> 01:42:22.000
<v Speaker 2>But you know what the national anthem </v>
<v Speaker 2>has been historically.</v>

2329
01:42:22.480 --> 01:42:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Get to your seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The game's about to start [inaudible].</v>

2330
01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:26.100
<v Speaker 2>That's all it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2331
01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:26.943
<v Speaker 2>It was like the to the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the last word in the last two </v>

2332
01:42:30.071 --> 01:42:33.790
<v Speaker 2>words are the national anthem play ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's literally,</v>

2333
01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:34.953
<v Speaker 2>that's what we thought was part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>song because that's what you heard </v>

2334
01:42:36.821 --> 01:42:37.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end,</v>

2335
01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.820
<v Speaker 2>the empire Yo play ball and the game </v>
<v Speaker 2>starts,</v>

<v Speaker 2>so I understood what captain nick did,</v>

2337
01:42:42.761 --> 01:42:43.594
<v Speaker 2>but now it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now it's been compromised and </v>

2338
01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:51.190
<v Speaker 2>changed and the arguments changed and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

2339
01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:52.690
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2340
01:42:52.810 --> 01:42:56.140

<v Speaker 2>People are using the land of the free to</v>

01:42:56.141 --> 01:42:57.800
<v Speaker 2>shake there dick as they like.</v>

<v Speaker 2>players,</v>

<v Speaker 2>apparently these hackers take control of</v>

2359
01:43:54.411 --> 01:43:55.244
<v Speaker 2>your database and they have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>encryption key and you have to pay them </v>

2360
01:43:59.781 --> 01:44:04.190
<v Speaker 2>in Bitcoin to get the encryption key to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get back your own data.</v>

2361
01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Giant group of people from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that engage in this and they,</v>

2362
01:44:10.551 --> 01:44:13.950
<v Speaker 1>they target large businesses and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be willing to pay.</v>

2368
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:28.303

<v Speaker 1>You think Colin Kaepernick gets </v>

2369
01:44:31.151 --> 01:44:34.660
<v Speaker 1>confronted by the suits?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they sit him down and go,</v>

2370
01:44:34.661 --> 01:44:36.430
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta stop doing this.</v>

2373
01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:42.093
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think this goes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess my question is like when the </v>

2374
01:44:44.831 --> 01:44:47.050
<v Speaker 1>more trump tweets about this ratings </v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

2375
01:44:47.110 --> 01:44:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Ella Nfl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

2376
01:44:48.490 --> 01:44:49.620
<v Speaker 1>sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2377
01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:50.463
<v Speaker 1>he tweets that and all the trumpets go </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with it and then they start </v>

2378
01:44:53.530 --> 01:44:54.570
<v Speaker 1>boycotting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are.</v>

2379
01:44:54.571 --> 01:44:55.404
<v Speaker 1>I see all these fucking tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boycott the NFL and all this crazy </v>

2380
01:44:58.811 --> 01:44:59.600
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2381
01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it goes,</v>

2382
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:03.740
<v Speaker 2>it goes nowhere because we have no </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention span is a nation,</v>

2383
01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:07.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to have to stop or </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue.</v>

2384
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:08.570
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing,</v>

2385
01:45:08.571 --> 01:45:09.404
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just had this mass shooting so the </v>

2386
01:45:12.021 --> 01:45:16.340
<v Speaker 2>attention now will be on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the NRA and you know,</v>

2387
01:45:16.341 --> 01:45:17.680
<v Speaker 2>guns and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

2388
01:45:17.720 --> 01:45:18.553
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the NFL will be on the back burner </v>

2389
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:25.100
<v Speaker 2>like we have you in the past month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six weeks.</v>

2390
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Confederate statues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2391
01:45:28.340 --> 01:45:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurricanes,</v>

2392
01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Charlotesville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2393
01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:32.240
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2394
01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:35.240
<v Speaker 2>the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's a mass shooting,</v>

2395
01:45:35.241 --> 01:45:36.680
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no,</v>

2396
01:45:36.710 --> 01:45:41.180
<v Speaker 2>we have no attention span as a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it will just go away and,</v>

2397
01:45:41.181 --> 01:45:44.840
<v Speaker 2>and in another month people will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching football.</v>

2398
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:46.370
<v Speaker 2>There'll be something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2399
01:45:46.460 --> 01:45:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there's always,</v>

2400
01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:51.680
<v Speaker 2>there's always the latest big story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that still,</v>

2401
01:45:51.681 --> 01:45:52.514
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't heard a thing about a </v>

2402
01:45:54.081 --> 01:45:58.280
<v Speaker 2>confederate statue in the last two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 2>with him getting knocked down,</v>

2403
01:45:58.281 --> 01:46:00.440
<v Speaker 2>have them getting put back up or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2404
01:46:00.441 --> 01:46:02.540
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so true,</v>

2405
01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:04.970
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrong or indifferent,</v>

2406
01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:08.030
<v Speaker 2>America has zero attention span.</v>

2407
01:46:08.660 --> 01:46:09.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you see what that fucking lady from </v>

2409
01:46:13.301 --> 01:46:17.560
<v Speaker 1>she was like a vice president at cvs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some huge position.</v>

2410
01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:21.640
<v Speaker 1>She went on facebook saying she didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel bad for the people that got shot in</v>

2411
01:46:21.641 --> 01:46:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Vegas because they were Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were likely Republicans.</v>

2412
01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:27.213
<v Speaker 1>She's talking about hundreds of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that got shot for going to a country </v>

2413
01:46:31.661 --> 01:46:32.494
<v Speaker 1>music concert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the fact that she just made this </v>

2414
01:46:34.751 --> 01:46:38.320
<v Speaker 1>blanket statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She thought they were likely Republicans</v>

2415
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:40.480
<v Speaker 1>because they were at a country music </v>
<v Speaker 1>concert.</v>

2416
01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:41.413
<v Speaker 2>You know the thing about that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the thing about freedom of </v>

2417
01:46:43.911 --> 01:46:47.330
<v Speaker 2>speech that people forget you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech,</v>

2418
01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:49.230
<v Speaker 2>but there's consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2419
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:51.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not freedom of speech without </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequence.</v>

2420
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:56.220
<v Speaker 2>So she can say that and then if CBS </v>
<v Speaker 2>fires her the next day,</v>

2421
01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:57.331
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2422
01:46:57.331 --> 01:46:59.490
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't have said that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you represent.</v>

2423
01:46:59.500 --> 01:47:00.333
<v Speaker 2>Should've kept it to yourself or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>should have told your friends at the </v>

2424
01:47:03.211 --> 01:47:04.044
<v Speaker 2>cocktail party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the minute you made that public </v>

2425
01:47:05.551 --> 01:47:08.730
<v Speaker 2>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to be associated with you,</v>

2426
01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:10.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's what we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

2427
01:47:10.261 --> 01:47:15.261
<v Speaker 1>this team thing that someone could be so</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically isolated,</v>

2428
01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:16.733
<v Speaker 1>they're so locked into this liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble that they think it's okay to say </v>

2429
01:47:20.821 --> 01:47:21.654
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's okay for mass murder to exist </v>

2430
01:47:25.290 --> 01:47:26.123
<v Speaker 1>and you don't feel bad for those massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't agree with them </v>

2431
01:47:29.041 --> 01:47:32.410
<v Speaker 1>politically or your team ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2432
01:47:32.490 --> 01:47:33.840
<v Speaker 1>what did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>

2433
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:35.430
<v Speaker 1>What is her name?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This lady.</v>

2434
01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:40.170
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This level.</v>

2435
01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:44.880
<v Speaker 1>She was a very high level executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't like some new sentences was.</v>

2436
01:47:44.881 --> 01:47:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost.</v>

2437
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:46.870
<v Speaker 1>She's fuck now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2438
01:47:46.890 --> 01:47:48.960
<v Speaker 1>she's likely fucked forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2439
01:47:48.961 --> 01:47:50.580
<v Speaker 1>this is not something that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget.</v>

2440
01:47:50.850 --> 01:47:51.683
<v Speaker 1>What did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a vice president of business </v>

2441
01:47:52.861 --> 01:47:53.700
<v Speaker 1>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

2442
01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:54.571
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2443
01:47:54.571 --> 01:47:58.320
<v Speaker 1>the vice president of business affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2444
01:47:58.321 --> 01:48:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Hailey gift them and gold wrote on her </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook page.</v>

2445
01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:01.974
<v Speaker 1>She was not sympathetic to victims of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shootings because she claimed most </v>

2446
01:48:04.381 --> 01:48:05.200
<v Speaker 1>country music fans.</v>

2447
01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2448
01:48:06.570 --> 01:48:07.403
<v Speaker 1>She wrote that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they wouldn't do anything when </v>

2449
01:48:09.061 --> 01:48:09.894
<v Speaker 1>children were murdered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no hope that repugnant will ever </v>

2450
01:48:12.901 --> 01:48:13.734
<v Speaker 1>do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually not even sympathetic </v>

2451
01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:20.580
<v Speaker 1>because country music fans are often a </v>
<v Speaker 1>republican gun toters.</v>

2452
01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:21.473
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got the right to say it and you've </v>

2453
01:48:22.761 --> 01:48:26.420
<v Speaker 1>got the right to lose your job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not sympathetic is such A.</v>

2454
01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:30.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean that could have been your sister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mom,</v>

2455
01:48:30.810 --> 01:48:32.460
<v Speaker 1>your mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your daughter,</v>

2456
01:48:32.850 --> 01:48:36.960
<v Speaker 1>someone's little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a country music thing,</v>

2457
01:48:36.961 --> 01:48:37.794
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of family type folks that </v>

2458
01:48:40.381 --> 01:48:42.150
<v Speaker 1>are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Country Music events.</v>

2459
01:48:42.151 --> 01:48:42.984
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what time of night that it </v>

2460
01:48:43.621 --> 01:48:45.300
<v Speaker 1>all went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how old are you?</v>

2461
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:48.800
<v Speaker 2>10 tall kid in one of those videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2462
01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:49.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure,</v>

2463
01:48:49.381 --> 01:48:51.940
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's music things that.</v>

2464
01:48:52.090 --> 01:48:53.550
<v Speaker 2>What I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I said was,</v>

2465
01:48:53.610 --> 01:48:56.550
<v Speaker 2>had it been a rap concert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have blamed the artists.</v>

2466
01:48:57.930 --> 01:48:58.763
<v Speaker 2>Not if a white guy did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would have been some serious calls </v>

2467
01:49:00.961 --> 01:49:02.730
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of horrific racism.</v>

2468
01:49:02.731 --> 01:49:05.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just lucky that a white guy was </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting white people,</v>

2469
01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:06.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then again,</v>

2470
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:10.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the reason I laugh because like,</v>

2471
01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:13.320
<v Speaker 2>that's how horrific we become as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

2472
01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 2>that that's the statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2473
01:49:15.410 --> 01:49:16.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2474
01:49:16.351 --> 01:49:17.184
<v Speaker 2>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll lose a white guy shooting white </v>

2475
01:49:18.271 --> 01:49:20.760
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we couldn't twist the race into it,</v>

2476
01:49:20.761 --> 01:49:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2477
01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Like today about someone was writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>about white privilege,</v>

2478
01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:25.431
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

2479
01:49:25.431 --> 01:49:26.460
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2480
01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:29.590
<v Speaker 2>we're insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're insane that,</v>

2481
01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:30.091
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2482
01:49:30.091 --> 01:49:33.630
<v Speaker 2>that is the issue with something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2483
01:49:33.690 --> 01:49:34.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

2484
01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:35.460
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true.</v>

2485
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean what you're saying is true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've reached that level of insanity</v>

2486
01:49:39.721 --> 01:49:41.190
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that statement is true.</v>

2487
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Can Imagine how freaked out people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be if that was a Muslim that did this.</v>

2488
01:49:46.210 --> 01:49:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2489
01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.550
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be war.</v>

2490
01:49:48.690 --> 01:49:51.580
<v Speaker 3>What would be war war?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be war in the streets.</v>

2491
01:49:52.210 --> 01:49:53.360
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

2492
01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:56.470
<v Speaker 3>actually like no Muslim would be safe in</v>
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

2493
01:49:56.770 --> 01:49:57.603
<v Speaker 3>I mean is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are we going to have war on white dudes </v>

2494
01:50:00.011 --> 01:50:01.090
<v Speaker 3>with guns?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2495
01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:04.000
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was white dudes with guns.</v>

2496
01:50:04.001 --> 01:50:06.910
<v Speaker 3>They got shot by white dude with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone must feel so,</v>

2497
01:50:06.970 --> 01:50:10.750
<v Speaker 3>so conflicted because a lot of those </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were in the audience,</v>

2498
01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:11.913
<v Speaker 3>like one of the country music guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually came out and said that he </v>

2499
01:50:14.081 --> 01:50:16.990
<v Speaker 3>completely switched his stance on gun </v>
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>

2500
01:50:16.991 --> 01:50:19.840
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been a second amendment advocate my</v>

2501
01:50:19.841 --> 01:50:21.100
<v Speaker 3>entire life.</v>

<v Speaker 3>permits that were all my staff.</v>

2526
01:51:25.211 --> 01:51:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's in their group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this ruins the narrative,</v>

2527
01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:29.403
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if our narrative is the Muslims </v>

2528
01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:33.460
<v Speaker 3>are terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they write today,</v>

2529
01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.353
<v Speaker 3>they are the terrorists and the black </v>
<v Speaker 3>people are criminals and the Mexicans </v>

2530
01:51:37.841 --> 01:51:39.960
<v Speaker 3>are rapists and dope dealers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

2531
01:51:40.180 --> 01:51:41.440
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit,</v>

2532
01:51:41.441 --> 01:51:44.170
<v Speaker 3>one of ours did it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A millionaire.</v>

2533
01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:48.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A white millionaire real estate investor</v>

2534
01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:50.350
<v Speaker 3>and a gambler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

2535
01:51:50.351 --> 01:51:52.740
<v Speaker 3>this ruins your narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you have to.</v>

2536
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Now you have to figure out how to change</v>
<v Speaker 3>your story to make him other.</v>

2537
01:51:57.550 --> 01:51:58.383
<v Speaker 3>Because he has to somehow become other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are people that are taken </v>

2538
01:52:01.361 --> 01:52:05.110
<v Speaker 3>advantage of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw this article on white privilege.</v>

2539
01:52:05.410 --> 01:52:06.243
<v Speaker 3>They're saying that the shooter had </v>
<v Speaker 3>white privilege and using his white </v>

2540
01:52:09.011 --> 01:52:09.844
<v Speaker 3>privilege.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how he walked through the casino </v>

2541
01:52:11.531 --> 01:52:14.350
<v Speaker 3>with all these guns and all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>equipment and shit like that.</v>

2542
01:52:14.351 --> 01:52:16.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is a psychopath?</v>

2543
01:52:17.230 --> 01:52:20.260
<v Speaker 3>I believe white privilege exists in </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain circumstances.</v>

2544
01:52:20.261 --> 01:52:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Not In that one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2545
01:52:21.611 --> 01:52:24.130
<v Speaker 3>That's a ridiculous argument.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are we looking at,</v>

2546
01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:25.510
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2547
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:28.390
<v Speaker 3>white privilege of the loan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roofshoot all that fucking guy.</v>

2548
01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That fucking fake black guy.</v>

2549
01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:34.730
<v Speaker 3>This of course it's Tim who writes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy is such a race.</v>

2550
01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:35.793
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talking about the article about the </v>

2551
01:52:36.731 --> 01:52:38.280
<v Speaker 3>guy being a lone wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2552
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:39.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2553
01:52:39.521 --> 01:52:42.820
<v Speaker 3>I read that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole thing that we're dealing with</v>

2554
01:52:42.821 --> 01:52:45.980
<v Speaker 3>as so many different facets to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the mass shooter</v>

2555
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.590
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a big part of it is the fact that it</v>

2556
01:52:48.591 --> 01:52:50.630
<v Speaker 2>become the narrative for the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

2557
01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:53.930
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a huge part of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's talking about.</v>

2558
01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 2>These people that have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason,</v>

2559
01:52:57.051 --> 01:53:02.051
<v Speaker 2>they have this need to be a guy who gets</v>
<v Speaker 2>paid attention to this.</v>

2560
01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:07.980
<v Speaker 2>This gets back to your point about </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental health and our mental health as a</v>

2561
01:53:08.661 --> 01:53:11.240
<v Speaker 2>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the mass shooter is a thing,</v>

2562
01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:12.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2563
01:53:12.520 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2564
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:14.143
<v Speaker 2>I think it was trevor Noah was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about on the daily show where we're </v>

2565
01:53:18.201 --> 01:53:20.830
<v Speaker 2>really not surprised anymore because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

2566
01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:24.320
<v Speaker 2>he said he's been in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>for two years living in New York for two</v>

2567
01:53:24.321 --> 01:53:27.530
<v Speaker 2>years and how many mass shootings is and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2568
01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:29.450
<v Speaker 2>but Americans are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2569
01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:31.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one.</v>

2570
01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.260
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

2571
01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:37.760
<v Speaker 2>we got to develop some sense of outrage </v>
<v Speaker 2>before we do something about this.</v>

2572
01:53:37.970 --> 01:53:41.180
<v Speaker 2>Or like the onion article was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about we just like,</v>

2573
01:53:41.181 --> 01:53:42.014
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just hope that it doesn't happen </v>

2574
01:53:43.251 --> 01:53:43.910
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

2575
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:45.500
<v Speaker 2>We won't do anything differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2576
01:53:45.530 --> 01:53:47.270
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>

2577
01:53:47.271 --> 01:53:48.710
<v Speaker 2>but we're just going to hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2578
01:53:49.070 --> 01:53:51.020
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that line.</v>

2579
01:53:51.420 --> 01:53:54.800
<v Speaker 2>The thoughts and prayers line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop it,</v>

2580
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:56.180
<v Speaker 2>stop it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop it.</v>

2581
01:53:56.210 --> 01:54:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Your thoughts and prayers go out to no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need to say something.</v>

2582
01:54:01.190 --> 01:54:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2583
01:54:02.411 --> 01:54:04.400
<v Speaker 2>and people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're,</v>

2584
01:54:04.460 --> 01:54:05.293
<v Speaker 2>if you're in the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a policy maker than you do </v>

2585
01:54:08.001 --> 01:54:10.220
<v Speaker 2>more than just say that you gotta you </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotTa,</v>

2586
01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:11.213
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put your balls on the line and step up </v>

2587
01:54:13.041 --> 01:54:13.874
<v Speaker 2>and do something challenged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Challenge the gun lobby about </v>

2588
01:54:17.001 --> 01:54:17.834
<v Speaker 2>registration of weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was easier for them to challenge the </v>

2589
01:54:21.141 --> 01:54:25.130
<v Speaker 2>hotel lobby about security and hotels </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the challenge.</v>

2590
01:54:25.131 --> 01:54:29.810
<v Speaker 2>The gun lobby about registration or </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapon registration of weapons.</v>

2591
01:54:29.811 --> 01:54:31.610
<v Speaker 2>This guy had these weapons illegally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2592
01:54:31.611 --> 01:54:33.710
<v Speaker 2>these are still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>

2593
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:36.500
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about criminal possessing</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal weapons.</v>

2594
01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sandy Hook,</v>

2595
01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:40.640
<v Speaker 2>he got hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got them from his mom.</v>

2596
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:42.200
<v Speaker 2>Got Him legally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2597
01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:45.350
<v Speaker 2>But he got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you can still make it,</v>

2598
01:54:45.351 --> 01:54:47.510
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you made it more difficult.</v>

2599
01:54:47.511 --> 01:54:50.930
<v Speaker 2>If you had to take a class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had to register,</v>

2600
01:54:50.931 --> 01:54:54.530
<v Speaker 2>if you had to be a percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a percentage that didn't,</v>

2601
01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:55.633
<v Speaker 2>didn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2602
01:54:55.730 --> 01:54:57.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean your shit should be locked up.</v>

2603
01:54:57.860 --> 01:54:58.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

2604
01:54:58.910 --> 01:55:02.540
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's interesting too is that trump</v>

2605
01:55:02.541 --> 01:55:03.374
<v Speaker 2>used to be a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A Democrat forever trumps a publicity </v>

2606
01:55:06.771 --> 01:55:08.300
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what I mean?</v>

2607
01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:09.020
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

2608
01:55:09.020 --> 01:55:09.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2609
01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:12.440
<v Speaker 2>this goes back to Sarah Pailin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2610
01:55:12.441 --> 01:55:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Like I never liked Sarah Palin or agreed</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Sarah Pailin,</v>

2611
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:19.790
<v Speaker 2>but I respected Sarah Pailin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his ability to manipulate the media.</v>

2612
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Sarah Pailin knew how to keep her name </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the news,</v>

2613
01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:23.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2617
01:55:31.370 --> 01:55:32.203

<v Speaker 2>I read somewhere that she is the most </v>

2618
01:55:34.401 --> 01:55:37.430
<v Speaker 2>famous woman on earth and I can believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2619
01:55:37.490 --> 01:55:38.323

<v Speaker 2>whole bit about aliens come down here </v>

02:01:49.071 --> 02:01:50.630
<v Speaker 3>they're going to show it in between </v>
<v Speaker 3>rounds.</v>

2756
02:01:51.370 --> 02:01:53.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just let it go for a second here.</v>

2757
02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:54.313
<v Speaker 3>What'd you do?</v>

2758
02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I just want to show just in between </v>
<v Speaker 3>rounds,</v>

2759
02:01:58.791 --> 02:02:01.610
<v Speaker 3>they'll show it on the replay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So went back to his corner,</v>

2760
02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:02.833
<v Speaker 3>48 Kaos and he's 62 fights and he's one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the few guys that when he lost to </v>

2761
02:02:09.451 --> 02:02:12.230
<v Speaker 3>sugar ray Leonard and he just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck this.</v>

2762
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:15.500
<v Speaker 3>And I don't think he lost that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched that fight a few times.</v>

2763
02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:16.813
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a decision for hire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should have been a decision for how to </v>

2764
02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:21.500
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See this totally slipped.</v>

2765
02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:23.690
<v Speaker 3>Total slip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

2766
02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:27.560
<v Speaker 3>He mostly missed the punch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Punch.</v>

2767
02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:30.590
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just kind of pushed him down with his</v>

2768
02:02:30.591 --> 02:02:31.424
<v Speaker 3>forearm and Hagler bounced right up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is not a knockdown you mother </v>

2769
02:02:34.381 --> 02:02:37.760
<v Speaker 3>fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he took some bombs from Mugabe.</v>

2770
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:40.710
<v Speaker 3>Mugabe was murdering people at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

2771
02:02:40.890 --> 02:02:42.350
<v Speaker 3>we're were talking about football </v>
<v Speaker 3>players.</v>

2772
02:02:42.351 --> 02:02:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Boxers is another one where they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know when to let it go.</v>

2773
02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:46.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2775
02:02:48.921 --> 02:02:49.900
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2776
02:02:49.901 --> 02:02:51.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they find it as well.</v>

2777
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:53.530
<v Speaker 3>Chocolate Dell's talking about making a </v>
<v Speaker 3>comeback.</v>

2778
02:02:53.570 --> 02:02:54.403
<v Speaker 3>Now you get hooked on the fame,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you gotta at some point you got to </v>

2779
02:02:58.380 --> 02:03:00.520
<v Speaker 3>the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even when they get old,</v>

2780
02:03:00.521 --> 02:03:03.240
<v Speaker 3>it's when they get to like 50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like late forties,</v>

2781

<v Speaker 3>I mean the dells talking about making a </v>

2782
02:03:06.381 --> 02:03:07.214
<v Speaker 3>comeback now at 48 and I think he's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of the fight game for at least five </v>

2783
02:03:11.301 --> 02:03:14.390
<v Speaker 3>or six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The UFC gave him a no,</v>

2784
02:03:14.450 --> 02:03:18.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm like sort of a no show job for </v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile and they said,</v>

2785
02:03:18.471 --> 02:03:20.210
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to work.</v>

2786
02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:21.373
<v Speaker 3>He just come in and do some events every</v>
<v Speaker 3>now and then you get a chunk of money </v>

2787
02:03:23.961 --> 02:03:27.830
<v Speaker 3>every month and so he was living off </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and doing really well with that,</v>

2788
02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:31.190
<v Speaker 3>but then the UFC sold and when the UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>sold,</v>

2789
02:03:31.191 --> 02:03:32.330
<v Speaker 3>they killed those jobs.</v>

2790
02:03:33.020 --> 02:03:33.853
<v Speaker 3>This whole fucking ufc sold things so </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy because they bought it for </v>

2791
02:03:36.561 --> 02:03:41.561
<v Speaker 3>$4,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billion like to make the monthly nut.</v>

2792
02:03:43.070 --> 02:03:43.903
<v Speaker 3>They had to cut 100 jobs from the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 people got fired and now they gotta </v>

2793
02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:51.400
<v Speaker 3>they gotta figure out some way to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2794

2795
02:03:54.321 --> 02:03:57.080
<v Speaker 3>payments every month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they sold some more of it off.</v>

2796
02:03:57.110 --> 02:03:57.943
<v Speaker 3>They sold some more of the assets off to</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other corporations or some other </v>

2797

<v Speaker 2>That was the shit and imagined being a </v>

2869
02:06:55.081 --> 02:06:55.914
<v Speaker 2>storm trooper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just an average storm trooper and you </v>

2870
02:06:57.691 --> 02:07:00.630
<v Speaker 2>hear this coming down the hall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

2871
02:07:00.631 --> 02:07:02.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might die.</v>

2872
02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:05.400
<v Speaker 2>I might die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't know if I did my job right,</v>

2873
02:07:06.120 --> 02:07:08.130
<v Speaker 2>but maybe he just needs to make an </v>
<v Speaker 2>example.</v>

2874
02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:12.500
<v Speaker 2>Try watching it today though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not it,</v>

2875
02:07:13.010 --> 02:07:15.930
<v Speaker 2>but it still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only still great because it,</v>

2876
02:07:16.110 --> 02:07:18.480
<v Speaker 2>it brings back the memory of how great </v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

2877
02:07:19.020 --> 02:07:20.880
<v Speaker 2>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the movie it was then,</v>

2878
02:07:20.881 --> 02:07:25.230
<v Speaker 2>but we'd never seen anything like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump into hyperspace.</v>

2879
02:07:25.860 --> 02:07:26.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2880
02:07:26.720 --> 02:07:28.770
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The special effects were terrible.</v>

2881
02:07:29.160 --> 02:07:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2882
02:07:31.180 --> 02:07:34.770
<v Speaker 2>dark theater with the actor's voice?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The actual actor?</v>

2883

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2884

2885
02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not exactly because you know,</v>

2886
02:07:40.571 --> 02:07:42.000
<v Speaker 2>the actor had to do the lines.</v>

2887
02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:47.290
<v Speaker 2>That's not quite the impact of James </v>
<v Speaker 2>Earl Jones,</v>

2888
02:07:47.460 --> 02:07:51.100
<v Speaker 2>James Earl Jones voice.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the modern version that ving rhames has </v>

<v Speaker 2>you're talking to a guy with a voice who</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't get a job because those guys do </v>

2892
02:08:03.191 --> 02:08:03.850
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2899
02:08:19.710 --> 02:08:21.640
<v Speaker 2>I got to start punching people in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>throat.</v>

2900
02:08:23.610 --> 02:08:25.690
<v Speaker 2>The voice over games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A weird game.</v>

2901
02:08:25.691 --> 02:08:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is it Donald Sutherland?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I saying that right?</v>

2912
02:08:57.791 --> 02:08:59.980
<v Speaker 2>It's at the right actor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy with the white hair.</v>

2913
02:08:59.981 --> 02:09:04.390
<v Speaker 2>The Donald Sutherland is the guy who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a invasion of the body snatchers,</v>

2914
02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:09.840
<v Speaker 2>maybe 80 to the same guy he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just did the hunger games movies.</v>

2915
02:09:09.911 --> 02:09:12.790
<v Speaker 2>He was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president and the hunger games.</v>

2916
02:09:12.791 --> 02:09:13.624
<v Speaker 2>That's the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2917
02:09:14.530 --> 02:09:15.640
<v Speaker 2>With Helen Mirren?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2918
02:09:15.970 --> 02:09:16.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>

2919
02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:18.850
<v Speaker 2>He does a ton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whenever I think of him,</v>

2920
02:09:18.851 --> 02:09:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I think of invasion of the body.</v>

2921
02:09:22.180 --> 02:09:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Then when he became one of the guys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2922
02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's getting paid?</v>

<v Speaker 2>done that guy.</v>

2925
02:09:32.270 --> 02:09:35.180
<v Speaker 2>I could have Dennis Haysburt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could have done that for a lot less.</v>

2926
02:09:35.630 --> 02:09:36.463
<v Speaker 2>He knows his name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine used to work with him </v>

2927
02:09:38.721 --> 02:09:40.910
<v Speaker 2>on a series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I know his name,</v>

2928
02:09:40.911 --> 02:09:44.420
<v Speaker 2>but you can go to any mall in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he was also a real estate guy.</v>

2929
02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:47.450
<v Speaker 2>He was also in major league pitchers.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It literally has one button that says </v>
<v Speaker 2>email the button,</v>

2984
02:12:29.631 --> 02:12:33.380
<v Speaker 2>it says text button that says pictures </v>
<v Speaker 2>at a button that says call.</v>

2985
02:12:33.710 --> 02:12:34.520
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>

2986
02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:36.980
<v Speaker 2>I can't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the simplest we could do.</v>

2987
02:12:37.220 --> 02:12:38.900
<v Speaker 2>She wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She won't mess with it.</v>

2988
02:12:39.230 --> 02:12:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bad for a long time.</v>

2989
02:12:41.541 --> 02:12:43.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mom was still like,</v>

2990
02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.620
<v Speaker 2>talk fast as long distance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2991
02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:49.600
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry mom,</v>

2992
02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:51.470
<v Speaker 2>I got this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got long distance.</v>

2993
02:12:51.471 --> 02:12:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Money ain't rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I got long distance money.</v>

2994
02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:56.480
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember when,</v>

2995
02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:57.553
<v Speaker 2>remember when roaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you would drive your car an hour </v>

2996
02:13:00.440 --> 02:13:04.760
<v Speaker 2>outside of where your coverage area was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She'd be fucked if you got a t and t you</v>

2997
02:13:04.761 --> 02:13:09.761
<v Speaker 2>still got Romeo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man a t and t they used to just raped me</v>

2998
02:13:09.861 --> 02:13:12.020
<v Speaker 2>when I traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was ridiculous.</v>

2999
02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:12.831
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3000
02:13:12.831 --> 02:13:13.664
<v Speaker 2>and then forget what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you went to the festival in </v>

3001
02:13:15.081 --> 02:13:16.490
<v Speaker 2>Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3002
02:13:16.491 --> 02:13:17.324
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna need my pay plus m a t and t </v>

3003
02:13:18.711 --> 02:13:22.250
<v Speaker 2>money might make a call one call.</v>

3004
02:13:22.310 --> 02:13:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of dudes or use their phone</v>

3005
02:13:24.261 --> 02:13:25.094
<v Speaker 2>overseas and didn't know when they got a</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars bill and got back home </v>

3006
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:30.950
<v Speaker 2>like a thousand dollars per phone call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the one guy he did,</v>

3007
02:13:30.990 --> 02:13:34.920
<v Speaker 2>he used his data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He kept using his phone.</v>

3008
02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:36.773
<v Speaker 2>He had a $3,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill when he came back from Montreal is </v>

3009
02:13:40.141 --> 02:13:44.220
<v Speaker 2>data was on 24 slash seven for like </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight days.</v>

3010
02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:47.770
<v Speaker 2>It's how can they charge you that much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just rude.</v>

3011
02:13:48.420 --> 02:13:50.340
<v Speaker 2>They cut it in half or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3012
02:13:50.341 --> 02:13:52.210
<v Speaker 2>but it was still.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3013
02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:54.480
<v Speaker 2>they give you a break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unreal.</v>

3014
02:13:54.510 --> 02:13:55.950
<v Speaker 2>So sweet of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3015
02:13:57.360 --> 02:13:58.193
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting that competition is</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of erase that whole roaming thing </v>

3016
02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:06.020
<v Speaker 2>like because more people were jockeying </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a share of the market rises and t,</v>

3017
02:14:06.781 --> 02:14:07.614
<v Speaker 2>t mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these different people and players </v>

3018
02:14:08.791 --> 02:14:12.390
<v Speaker 2>and sprint and they just had to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>some concessions for competition.</v>

3019
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Well the next big test is going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars iphone,</v>

3020
02:14:17.130 --> 02:14:18.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if people pay it,</v>

3021
02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:21.030
<v Speaker 2>then that's what phones are going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cost.</v>

3022
02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:23.640
<v Speaker 2>Well isn't that new Samsung Galaxy note </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight?</v>

3023
02:14:23.641 --> 02:14:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that similarly priced?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both going to be up there.</v>

3024
02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:28.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're basically computers.</v>

3025
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:30.540
<v Speaker 2>That note eight is pretty fucking sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3026
02:14:30.690 --> 02:14:32.060
<v Speaker 2>They're bad ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a.</v>

3027
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:32.933
<v Speaker 2>that's a big jump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's basically you're doubling the </v>

3028
02:14:34.891 --> 02:14:36.380
<v Speaker 2>price of a cell phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>

3029
02:14:36.381 --> 02:14:37.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the new ones now?</v>

3030
02:14:37.951 --> 02:14:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I think new ones now are five to 600 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bucks.</v>

3031
02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I didn't just buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the point,</v>

3032
02:14:44.191 --> 02:14:46.050
<v Speaker 2>but now you're not going to get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3033
02:14:46.051 --> 02:14:47.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's always been.</v>

3034
02:14:47.191 --> 02:14:50.100
<v Speaker 2>You get the discount if they sign up for</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years or so that,</v>

3035
02:14:50.450 --> 02:14:53.700
<v Speaker 2>well apparently with this one it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be just you gotta just by the phone.</v>

3036
02:14:54.230 --> 02:14:56.060
<v Speaker 2>They're just kinda getting greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3037
02:14:56.061 --> 02:14:56.894
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a test because if people </v>

3038
02:14:58.711 --> 02:15:01.350
<v Speaker 2>don't go for it then they'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3039
02:15:01.410 --> 02:15:04.000
<v Speaker 2>well we got to go back to the old model </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3040
02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:05.093
<v Speaker 2>will be willing to pay more money for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone if you knew that the phone was </v>

3041
02:15:09.481 --> 02:15:13.560
<v Speaker 2>made by people that got paid a living </v>
<v Speaker 2>wage.</v>

3042
02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:14.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

3043
02:15:14.910 --> 02:15:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3044
02:15:15.850 --> 02:15:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm all about that man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3045
02:15:17.151 --> 02:15:21.390
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine with paying more for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take care of the employees.</v>

3046
02:15:21.690 --> 02:15:22.240
<v Speaker 2>That's the</v>

3047
02:15:22.240 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 1>best argument for made in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3048
02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:25.413
<v Speaker 1>that made in America argument is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people look at it as patriotism or </v>

3049
02:15:28.211 --> 02:15:29.044
<v Speaker 1>nationalism and I could see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the argument of it's </v>

3050
02:15:31.541 --> 02:15:33.730
<v Speaker 1>made in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then people have to get paid,</v>

3051
02:15:33.860 --> 02:15:35.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least a minimum wage.</v>

3052
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:36.600
<v Speaker 2>Know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3053
02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:37.433
<v Speaker 2>who said it and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's been lost and I think it's one </v>

3054
02:15:39.241 --> 02:15:41.640
<v Speaker 2>of his great quote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry Ford,</v>

3055
02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Henry Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to never forget,</v>

3056
02:15:44.461 --> 02:15:47.100
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay them enough to buy the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>

3057
02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:50.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a smart quote.</v>

3058
02:15:50.190 --> 02:15:52.680
<v Speaker 2>And they forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry Ford was a wizard.</v>

3059
02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:53.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3060
02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:54.373
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford also figured out that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make fenders out of hemp and have far </v>

3061
02:15:58.401 --> 02:16:00.290
<v Speaker 1>superior to metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3062
02:16:00.400 --> 02:16:01.233
<v Speaker 1>There's an old video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing those old video of his </v>

3063
02:16:03.141 --> 02:16:04.460
<v Speaker 1>first car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

3064
02:16:04.610 --> 02:16:05.443
<v Speaker 1>His first car that he made had fenders </v>
<v Speaker 1>made out of hemp and he's banging it </v>

3065
02:16:09.441 --> 02:16:12.530
<v Speaker 1>with a hammer and the hammer is just bow</v>
<v Speaker 1>hemp is.</v>

3066
02:16:13.100 --> 02:16:13.933
<v Speaker 1>Forget about whatever anybody feels </v>
<v Speaker 1>about marijuana and stoners are always </v>

3067
02:16:16.821 --> 02:16:21.710
<v Speaker 1>trying to push it on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hemp itself as a textile,</v>

3068
02:16:21.711 --> 02:16:25.700
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a commodity hemp when they use him to</v>

3069
02:16:25.701 --> 02:16:28.970
<v Speaker 1>make things out of hemp is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange.</v>

3070
02:16:29.850 --> 02:16:30.683
<v Speaker 1>Where if you had a piece of hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the size of this water bottle is a </v>

3071
02:16:33.521 --> 02:16:34.660
<v Speaker 1>large water bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3072
02:16:34.930 --> 02:16:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Have you had a piece of hemp that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thick?</v>

3073
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:40.270
<v Speaker 1>It would be hard like oak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but light,</v>

3074
02:16:40.271 --> 02:16:42.700
<v Speaker 1>like Balsa Wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking weird.</v>

3075
02:16:42.701 --> 02:16:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Similar to bamboo or it's similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bamboo,</v>

3076
02:16:45.761 --> 02:16:47.500
<v Speaker 1>but stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much stronger.</v>

3077
02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:49.090
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strange.</v>

3078
02:16:49.140 --> 02:16:53.260
<v Speaker 1>It's the impact is 10 times stronger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than steel.</v>

3079
02:16:53.830 --> 02:16:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Hemp plastic panels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you go see if he can find the video.</v>

3080
02:16:58.301 --> 02:17:03.301
<v Speaker 1>It's a crazy video because in the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's banging on this fucking fender with</v>

3081
02:17:04.361 --> 02:17:05.194
<v Speaker 1>a hammer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy video because he had my phone to </v>

3082
02:17:07.511 --> 02:17:08.950
<v Speaker 1>make videos in 1910.</v>

3083
02:17:11.170 --> 02:17:13.450
<v Speaker 1>It probably had a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a truck.</v>

3084
02:17:15.110 --> 02:17:17.630
<v Speaker 1>One of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably had to crank it back then,</v>

3085
02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:18.580
<v Speaker 1>right Craig?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3086
02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He probably did like,</v>

3087
02:17:20.501 --> 02:17:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that's his car actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty Dope car.</v>

3088
02:17:23.351 --> 02:17:26.500
<v Speaker 1>If you had that today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive around that bitch with everybody.</v>

3089
02:17:26.501 --> 02:17:27.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this.</v>

3090
02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:31.180
<v Speaker 1>He's wailing on it with a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>heroin.</v>

3091
02:17:31.181 --> 02:17:35.680
<v Speaker 1>It just bounces off and it's completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable.</v>

3092
02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:40.980
<v Speaker 1>You can plant it in an area and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate it within a year.</v>

3093
02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:42.093
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you have the same issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>trees and you try to regenerate an area </v>

3094
02:17:45.341 --> 02:17:46.780
<v Speaker 1>with trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes decades.</v>

3095
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:48.030
<v Speaker 1>So is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3096
02:17:48.031 --> 02:17:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess so it'd be more similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bamboo than fiberglass.</v>

3097
02:17:51.250 --> 02:17:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More similar to bamboo than fiberglass,</v>

3098
02:17:53.621 --> 02:17:56.620
<v Speaker 1>but superior to both of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>

3099
02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:00.730
<v Speaker 1>It's fiberglass cracks and breaks the </v>
<v Speaker 1>light like fiberglass,</v>

3100
02:18:00.731 --> 02:18:02.710
<v Speaker 1>but far stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

3101
02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:03.603
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a corvette that defender just </v>

3102
02:18:05.021 --> 02:18:06.250
<v Speaker 1>cracked and broke off.</v>

3103
02:18:06.580 --> 02:18:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a corvette.</v>

3104
02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I have an older one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a magnificent more.</v>

3105
02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:12.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

3106
02:18:12.371 --> 02:18:16.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who made a car recently out of hemp,</v>

3107
02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:17.673
<v Speaker 1>Lotus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lotus made a hemp car really recently </v>

3108
02:18:20.500 --> 02:18:22.840
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were hoping that,</v>

3109
02:18:22.841 --> 02:18:23.674
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other manufacturers are gonna start </v>

3110
02:18:24.491 --> 02:18:28.900
<v Speaker 1>using this because it's actually safer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stronger than fiberglass.</v>

3111
02:18:28.901 --> 02:18:29.734
<v Speaker 1>Safer than fiberglass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like the similar in terms of </v>

3112
02:18:32.171 --> 02:18:35.320
<v Speaker 1>its weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that stripe down the middle is exposed.</v>

3113
02:18:35.890 --> 02:18:39.430
<v Speaker 1>There's photos where you could see it </v>
<v Speaker 1>more clearly.</v>

3114
02:18:39.431 --> 02:18:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Jamie cv like just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3115
02:18:42.341 --> 02:18:43.570
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

3116
02:18:43.630 --> 02:18:47.570
<v Speaker 1>that is what the actual fiber looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's not painted and,</v>

3117
02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:48.251
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3118
02:18:48.251 --> 02:18:50.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sealed or it's just sealed rather,</v>

3119
02:18:50.980 --> 02:18:53.470
<v Speaker 1>but not a colored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could see the fiber.</v>

3120
02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:55.210
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredible stuff,</v>

3121
02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:56.073
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't fuck with the </v>

3122
02:18:57.641 --> 02:18:59.590
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually good.</v>

3123
02:18:59.591 --> 02:19:03.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a cleaner process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why is it not being used?</v>

3124
02:19:03.370 --> 02:19:04.203
<v Speaker 1>Because it's connected to marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only reason just publishing </v>

3125
02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:10.240
<v Speaker 1>publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Up until very recently,</v>

3126
02:19:10.450 --> 02:19:12.580
<v Speaker 1>hemp was illegal to grow in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

3127
02:19:12.581 --> 02:19:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Now I know this for a fact because my </v>
<v Speaker 1>company on it,</v>

3128
02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:19.660
<v Speaker 1>we had to buy all of our hemp from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada when we sell hemp protein,</v>

3129
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:20.583
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the best versions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein that you can get in plant based </v>

3130
02:19:23.111 --> 02:19:25.930
<v Speaker 1>forum because it has a full amino acid </v>
<v Speaker 1>profile,</v>

3131
02:19:25.931 --> 02:19:29.470
<v Speaker 1>very easy to digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get high quality hemp hearts like</v>

3132
02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:30.353
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that we sell real easy going </v>
<v Speaker 1>down like it doesn't fuck with you or </v>

3133
02:19:34.131 --> 02:19:34.964
<v Speaker 1>give you a gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people have issues with like </v>

3134
02:19:36.710 --> 02:19:40.940
<v Speaker 1>whey protein if they have any sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lactose intolerance and some people just</v>

3135
02:19:40.941 --> 02:19:42.050
<v Speaker 1>doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't agree with them.</v>

3136
02:19:42.590 --> 02:19:43.423
<v Speaker 1>Hemp is very easy to digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'd take it hemp protein shake </v>

3137
02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:47.444
<v Speaker 1>and I'll go to the gym like an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>later and have no issues working out </v>

3138
02:19:49.581 --> 02:19:50.414
<v Speaker 1>pretty hard.</v>

3139
02:19:50.450 --> 02:19:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Whereas some stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just see how I fucked up.</v>

3140
02:19:53.181 --> 02:19:54.014
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up eating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But because of all the laws that have </v>

3141
02:19:57.260 --> 02:20:02.030
<v Speaker 1>been in existence since the 19 thirties </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarding hemp and marijuana,</v>

3142
02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:03.373
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't even realize that the laws were </v>

3143
02:20:04.881 --> 02:20:09.881
<v Speaker 1>actually put in place to stop hemp as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a commodity,</v>

3144
02:20:10.250 --> 02:20:14.680
<v Speaker 1>not really to stop marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stopped marijuana to stop him.</v>

3145
02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was all done by William </v>
<v Speaker 1>Randolph hearst.</v>

3146
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:18.493
<v Speaker 1>But this fucking asshole in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties ruined things in 2017 with </v>

3147
02:20:23.961 --> 02:20:27.440
<v Speaker 1>propaganda that even the term marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>was never used.</v>

3148
02:20:27.441 --> 02:20:28.274
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana was a wild Mexican tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason why they used the term </v>

3149
02:20:32.091 --> 02:20:34.580
<v Speaker 1>marijuana because they could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of saying cannabis,</v>

3150
02:20:34.581 --> 02:20:36.890
<v Speaker 1>which everybody already knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of saying hemp,</v>

3151
02:20:36.891 --> 02:20:38.420
<v Speaker 1>which everybody already knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

3152
02:20:38.421 --> 02:20:39.254
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this drug called marijuana and </v>

3153
02:20:41.121 --> 02:20:43.770
<v Speaker 1>these Mexicans and blacks are smoking is</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk and,</v>

3154
02:20:43.860 --> 02:20:44.693
<v Speaker 1>and all the white women.</v>

3155
02:20:46.140 --> 02:20:47.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the 13,</v>

3156
02:20:47.130 --> 02:20:49.560
<v Speaker 3>that documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they talked about it fucking amazing.</v>

3157
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:52.430
<v Speaker 3>Anything that with opium and the Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the railroads,</v>

3158
02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:53.473
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to this day is why hamp is such a </v>

3159
02:20:56.341 --> 02:21:01.200
<v Speaker 3>problem in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All that bullshit from 1930 something is</v>

3160
02:21:01.201 --> 02:21:04.500
<v Speaker 3>why we're still.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We still have issues about hemp protein.</v>

3161
02:21:04.530 --> 02:21:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you get high off of it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything?</v>

3162
02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:08.310
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's no thc whatsoever.</v>

3163
02:21:08.430 --> 02:21:12.450
<v Speaker 3>It's just the fiber from the stocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's curious to me personally.</v>

3164
02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.310
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3165
02:21:14.430 --> 02:21:16.170
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hemp protein is amazing,</v>

3166
02:21:16.220 --> 02:21:17.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do.</v>

3167
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:19.670
<v Speaker 1>You have to tell you the CBDS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

3168
02:21:19.671 --> 02:21:20.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3169
02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:22.730
<v Speaker 1>a really great for pain and pain </v>
<v Speaker 1>medication or pain,</v>

3170
02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:25.340
<v Speaker 1>inflammation and things along those </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>

3171
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:26.563
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Greg Fitzsimmons says he gets high </v>

3172
02:21:27.741 --> 02:21:27.990
<v Speaker 1>off off of</v>

3173
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:29.810
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand that.</v>

3174
02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:33.440
<v Speaker 3>He said he tries that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Charlotte's web cbd oil,</v>

3175
02:21:33.470 --> 02:21:34.303
<v Speaker 3>which is full profile hemp oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He says it gives them hi b might be </v>

3176
02:21:37.641 --> 02:21:40.190
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fits.</v>

3177
02:21:40.430 --> 02:21:41.200
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

3178
02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:44.420
<v Speaker 3>he's a city boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things react per lead is metabolism.</v>

3179
02:21:45.260 --> 02:21:47.930
<v Speaker 3>But if we were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we were reasonable and intelligent,</v>

3180
02:21:47.950 --> 02:21:49.670
<v Speaker 3>we'd be making a shitload of things with</v>
<v Speaker 3>hemp.</v>

3181
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Fiber is so easy to regenerate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so easy to grow.</v>

3182
02:21:53.390 --> 02:21:55.490
<v Speaker 3>It's totally sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's healthy.</v>

3183
02:21:55.880 --> 02:21:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3184
02:21:57.140 --> 02:21:57.973
<v Speaker 3>maybe that will change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm hoping maybe that will change in </v>

3185
02:22:00.051 --> 02:22:02.270
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're slowly,</v>

3186
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:04.700
<v Speaker 3>slowly waking up and getting rid of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>

3187
02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3188
02:22:06.860 --> 02:22:09.140
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the propaganda that created it.</v>

3189
02:22:09.290 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 3>You know what another thing is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>people make plastic with it.</v>

3190
02:22:12.590 --> 02:22:15.980
<v Speaker 3>You can make degradable biodegradable </v>
<v Speaker 3>hemp plastic.</v>

3191
02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to weed.</v>

3192
02:22:17.241 --> 02:22:18.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3193
02:22:18.021 --> 02:22:20.060
<v Speaker 3>people do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've had legal weed,</v>

3194
02:22:20.090 --> 02:22:20.923
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>People aren't running the streets </v>

3195
02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:22.840
<v Speaker 3>raping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am for.</v>

3196
02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:26.020
<v Speaker 3>Well you might've been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just smoke pot.</v>

3197
02:22:26.110 --> 02:22:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I know who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wake up,</v>

3198
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:32.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll wake up covered in blood and is an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument that it wasn't the wheat.</v>

3199
02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the idea that,</v>

3200
02:22:36.390 --> 02:22:38.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the one that's illegal.</v>

3201
02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:41.490
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucking crazy when you can just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to a liquor store or just,</v>

3202
02:22:41.690 --> 02:22:42.523
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to a bar almost anywhere they look </v>

3203
02:22:45.570 --> 02:22:46.950
<v Speaker 2>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the lobby.</v>

3204
02:22:47.220 --> 02:22:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I read this crazy article about the weed</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing in Vegas,</v>

3205
02:22:51.420 --> 02:22:52.253
<v Speaker 2>like they made a compromise with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>liquor lobby that you had to have a </v>

3206
02:22:55.981 --> 02:22:56.814
<v Speaker 2>liquor distributor license to distribute</v>
<v Speaker 2>the marijuana to literally take it to </v>

3207
02:23:00.361 --> 02:23:05.361
<v Speaker 2>the dispensary's and no one got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>license so they couldn't deliver it for.</v>

3208
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.983
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm sure they figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but initially like nobody could </v>

3209
02:23:09.751 --> 02:23:11.880
<v Speaker 2>deliberate the liquor company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

3210
02:23:11.881 --> 02:23:12.714
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would we deliver it like we don't </v>

3211

<v Speaker 2>want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we want you to drink.</v>

3213
02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:19.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were running into a shortage.</v>

3214
02:23:19.290 --> 02:23:21.660
<v Speaker 2>It was so chaotic when the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they couldn't,</v>

3215
02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:24.300
<v Speaker 2>couldn't distributed anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

3216
02:23:24.570 --> 02:23:25.403
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't keep up with the demand </v>

3217
02:23:26.101 --> 02:23:27.390
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just so insane.</v>

3218
02:23:27.470 --> 02:23:28.303
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

3219
02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:29.940
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

3220
02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:31.980
<v Speaker 2>and they still have the money issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3221
02:23:31.981 --> 02:23:33.560
<v Speaker 2>They still have the issue of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3222
02:23:33.690 --> 02:23:36.540
<v Speaker 2>the risk of putting into banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially with sessions.</v>

3223
02:23:36.690 --> 02:23:37.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sessions wanting to be some anti weed </v>

3224
02:23:39.211 --> 02:23:40.470
<v Speaker 2>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little goofy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>One weird fucker.</v>

3226
02:23:42.571 --> 02:23:44.250
<v Speaker 2>That guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3227
02:23:44.251 --> 02:23:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like watching trump shit on him,</v>

3228
02:23:46.810 --> 02:23:47.643
<v Speaker 2>see him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of have to swallow it and eat </v>

<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3230
02:23:49.591 --> 02:23:50.424
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump was real high on him and in any </v>

3231
02:23:52.831 --> 02:23:57.450
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't recruit recluse himself because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the investigation in Russia.</v>

3232
02:23:57.960 --> 02:24:01.830
<v Speaker 2>My favorite joke was when Roy Wood Jr </v>
<v Speaker 2>called sessions a confederate monument.</v>

3233
02:24:04.390 --> 02:24:07.110
<v Speaker 2>That's a great job.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he was a guy that was,</v>

3235
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:13.830
<v Speaker 2>it was Ted Kennedy that was calling him </v>
<v Speaker 2>a disgrace.</v>

3236
02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Like back in the 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3237
02:24:15.751 --> 02:24:16.584
<v Speaker 2>this guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was too racist to be a judge in the </v>

3238
02:24:20.611 --> 02:24:22.620
<v Speaker 2>Reagan era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3239
02:24:22.621 --> 02:24:23.454
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean literally like Congress was </v>

3240
02:24:24.691 --> 02:24:25.261
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

02:24:25.261 --> 02:24:27.540
<v Speaker 2>like you're too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're too far gone.</v>

3242
02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:30.780
<v Speaker 2>And he had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy has a long history of crazy,</v>

3243
02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:33.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he wants to bring back the just say</v>

3244
02:24:33.211 --> 02:24:37.380
<v Speaker 2>no days literally said that he wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring back the policy of just saying no.</v>

3245
02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.510
<v Speaker 2>And the war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war on drugs,</v>

3246
02:24:39.511 --> 02:24:42.600
<v Speaker 2>throwing people in jail forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just saying no.</v>

3247
02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:46.290
<v Speaker 2>And he's still living in the Nancy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Reagan days.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

3249
02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:51.210
<v Speaker 2>That was probably progressive for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3250
02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:52.800
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>

3251
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's moved away from the far right.</v>

3252
02:24:56.220 --> 02:25:00.180
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants it to be 1950.</v>

3253
02:25:00.270 --> 02:25:01.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3254
02:25:01.501 --> 02:25:04.540
<v Speaker 2>that's his dream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was in high school back then,</v>

3255
02:25:05.070 --> 02:25:08.180
<v Speaker 2>getting all the ladies know things were </v>
<v Speaker 2>good and he wants you to be 1950.</v>

3256
02:25:08.190 --> 02:25:10.050
<v Speaker 2>That there were black people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>segregated.</v>

3257
02:25:10.051 --> 02:25:12.630
<v Speaker 2>There were no Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Mexican didn't need.</v>

3258
02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:14.510
<v Speaker 2>It.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Didn't even exist in the 1950.</v>

3259
02:25:14.700 --> 02:25:15.533
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Ricardo was the only Latino </v>

3261
02:25:22.801 --> 02:25:26.320
<v Speaker 2>And Ricky Ricardo though was Cuban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cubans were completely respectable.</v>

3262
02:25:26.321 --> 02:25:27.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a man from Spain,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like a man from Spain.</v>

3266
02:25:34.060 --> 02:25:36.160
<v Speaker 2>When people started looking at Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3267
02:25:36.161 --> 02:25:38.440
<v Speaker 2>it became this different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba.</v>

<v Speaker 3>diplomats in their family members were </v>

3327
02:28:30.681 --> 02:28:35.210
<v Speaker 3>struck with no logical motivation beyond</v>
<v Speaker 3>disrupting us Cuban relations.</v>

3328
02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:36.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was some sort of seemed to not even </v>

3329
02:28:37.791 --> 02:28:42.791
<v Speaker 3>describing what kind of attack it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some kind of scroll down here.</v>

3330
02:28:43.280 --> 02:28:44.113
<v Speaker 3>The first disturbing reports of piercing</v>
<v Speaker 3>high pitch noises and inexplicably </v>

3331
02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:52.910
<v Speaker 3>ailments pointed to someone deliberately</v>
<v Speaker 3>targeting the US government intelligence</v>

3332
02:28:52.911 --> 02:28:53.744
<v Speaker 3>network on the communist run island and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what seems like a bone chilling </v>

3333
02:28:56.901 --> 02:28:57.734
<v Speaker 3>escalation of the tit for tat spy games </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Washington van have waged over the </v>

3334
02:29:04.190 --> 02:29:05.220
<v Speaker 3>last half century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know there's an end for me.</v>

3335
02:29:05.250 --> 02:29:06.560
<v Speaker 3>New Year's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

3336
02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:08.660
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of the Brown note?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>

3337
02:29:09.590 --> 02:29:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I was thought that maybe it was getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>at this,</v>

3338
02:29:11.601 --> 02:29:13.130
<v Speaker 3>but I don't even know if it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

3339
02:29:13.131 --> 02:29:13.964
<v Speaker 3>but it sounds like it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a sonic note that can be used </v>

3340
02:29:17.421 --> 02:29:19.820
<v Speaker 3>supposedly weaponized to make someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>and shit themselves.</v>

3341
02:29:20.010 --> 02:29:20.843
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did hear about that and I know when I </v>

3342
02:29:21.681 --> 02:29:23.600
<v Speaker 3>was an audio school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember we were asking the teacher if</v>

3343
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:25.930
<v Speaker 3>you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if that's that a possibility or whatnot,</v>

3344
02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:30.940
<v Speaker 3>and I don't know if we ever got anywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>realistic because it tested well.</v>

3345
02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:36.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad to hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3346
02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:43.490
<v Speaker 3>because a human hearing stops at 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>hertz,</v>

3347
02:29:43.491 --> 02:29:45.500
<v Speaker 3>which is a really low base and you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>barely do.</v>

3348
02:29:45.501 --> 02:29:48.890
<v Speaker 3>You have to have really good hearing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>here that if you do a sound test,</v>

3349
02:29:48.891 --> 02:29:52.580
<v Speaker 3>someone will play that sound and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>almost does sound like a pressure.</v>

3350
02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:54.650
<v Speaker 3>You'll feel like a pressure change in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your head.</v>

3351
02:29:54.740 --> 02:29:56.930
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who's ears are fucked </v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

3352
02:29:56.931 --> 02:29:58.520
<v Speaker 3>My friend John Dudley,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know John Dudley,</v>

3353
02:29:58.760 --> 02:29:59.593
<v Speaker 3>his ears are fucked up from guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you shut a lot of guns and he was </v>

3354
02:30:01.791 --> 02:30:02.624
<v Speaker 3>younger and he blew blues hearing out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so he has a hard time hearing </v>

3355
02:30:05.331 --> 02:30:10.160
<v Speaker 3>certain things but he can hear really </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep sounds way better than I can.</v>

3356
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:12.050
<v Speaker 3>My hearing is good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

3357
02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:13.460
<v Speaker 3>he's got like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like,</v>

3358
02:30:14.210 --> 02:30:15.043
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone is blind they can hear </v>

3359
02:30:15.921 --> 02:30:17.180
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like that.</v>

3360
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his hearing is fucked up,</v>

3361
02:30:19.011 --> 02:30:22.280
<v Speaker 3>but certain notes penetrate that don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>get me.</v>

3362
02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:26.790
<v Speaker 3>I think he can hear like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like deep sounds like an animal grumping</v>

3363
02:30:26.940 --> 02:30:27.950
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

3364
02:30:27.951 --> 02:30:28.570
<v Speaker 3>you hear that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3365
02:30:28.570 --> 02:30:29.403
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anything like you can hear shit that </v>

3366
02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:33.320
<v Speaker 3>most people can hear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

3367
02:30:33.370 --> 02:30:35.990
<v Speaker 3>It's very weird because most of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>sound is fucked up.</v>

3368
02:30:36.630 --> 02:30:39.590
<v Speaker 3>So he just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that Brown note real?</v>

3369
02:30:40.210 --> 02:30:42.770
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was asking if you had ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>heard of it or have heard of it.</v>

3370
02:30:42.800 --> 02:30:43.633
<v Speaker 3>That would be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be your best and worst </v>

3371
02:30:45.141 --> 02:30:45.974
<v Speaker 3>podcast over the brown note.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mcast driving their cars just shitting </v>

3372
02:30:50.601 --> 02:30:52.550
<v Speaker 3>themselves on the train.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit themselves.</v>

3373
02:30:53.290 --> 02:30:55.320
<v Speaker 3>Amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I hate it.</v>

3374
02:30:55.890 --> 02:30:56.723
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine he played in the background of </v>

3375
02:30:57.921 --> 02:31:02.420
<v Speaker 3>the most amazing podcasts ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have some really cool person in</v>

3376
02:31:02.421 --> 02:31:04.640
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really interesting subject.</v>

3377
02:31:04.641 --> 02:31:07.580
<v Speaker 3>I remember mythbusters tried to do this </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think they used a really,</v>

3378
02:31:07.581 --> 02:31:11.960
<v Speaker 3>really big sound system to try to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreate this low frequency stuff.</v>

3379
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:13.063
<v Speaker 3>Almost impossible to get and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't get very far because they </v>

3380
02:31:16.431 --> 02:31:18.290
<v Speaker 3>don't have that government shit bro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stuff.</v>

3381
02:31:18.291 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 3>They use it in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what's</v>

3382
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:21.780
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people shitting themselves,</v>

3383
02:31:21.990 --> 02:31:23.190
<v Speaker 1>they just don't want to say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I did.</v>

3384
02:31:23.191 --> 02:31:24.690
<v Speaker 1>I was hoping it would say something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3385
02:31:25.540 --> 02:31:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the sonic attack is like.</v>

3386
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Do they pointed out you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have that.</v>

3387
02:31:30.301 --> 02:31:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The speakers that can be taken literally</v>

3388
02:31:33.481 --> 02:31:35.930
<v Speaker 1>pointed at you like across the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>and press a button.</v>

3389
02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the sounds going right out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking with your inherent.</v>

3390
02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3391
02:31:38.710 --> 02:31:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Will sound it's directional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that absolutely makes sense.</v>

3392
02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How weird is that?</v>

3393
02:31:43.901 --> 02:31:45.430
<v Speaker 2>That they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's doing that?</v>

3394
02:31:46.140 --> 02:31:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Must be someone in the Cuban government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't want us over there.</v>

3395
02:31:48.941 --> 02:31:52.750
<v Speaker 2>It was just to fuck with the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to fuck with the diplomat.</v>

3396
02:31:52.840 --> 02:31:53.673
<v Speaker 2>The Yankee spies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said that is something that's </v>

3397
02:31:55.091 --> 02:31:55.924
<v Speaker 2>always going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just little games they play with </v>

3398
02:31:57.341 --> 02:31:58.174
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>

3399
02:31:58.390 --> 02:32:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This says they couldn't even get in here</v>

3400
02:32:00.151 --> 02:32:02.160
<v Speaker 1>where they couldn't even hear him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just weren't.</v>

3401
02:32:02.161 --> 02:32:04.860
<v Speaker 1>And they weren't even aware of an attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>does later they had symptoms.</v>

3402
02:32:05.540 --> 02:32:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably a little bit headache,</v>

3403
02:32:08.880 --> 02:32:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3404
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:14.250
<v Speaker 1>How the boy magic that gets into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong hands.</v>

3405
02:32:14.430 --> 02:32:15.930
<v Speaker 1>What if that becomes like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3406
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:16.783
<v Speaker 1>technology gets into the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>regular people eventually like tasers </v>

3407
02:32:19.051 --> 02:32:21.660
<v Speaker 1>and shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just go by a Taser or had you get by</v>

3408
02:32:21.661 --> 02:32:24.150
<v Speaker 1>some sound shit and just pointed at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor while he's mowing the lawn.</v>

3409
02:32:24.450 --> 02:32:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Art Give me know if the MP is an emp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a real threat to America or whatever.</v>

3410
02:32:29.611 --> 02:32:30.444
<v Speaker 1>Like a matrix style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emp wipes out all of the electronics </v>

3411
02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:39.020
<v Speaker 1>area with it as a natural solar blasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sort of solar flare.</v>

3412
02:32:39.630 --> 02:32:40.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3413
02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:45.450
<v Speaker 1>there's a massive potential for solar </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupt and interruption of our entire</v>

3414
02:32:45.451 --> 02:32:46.284
<v Speaker 1>power grid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some massive solar flare happens </v>

3415
02:32:48.541 --> 02:32:52.130
<v Speaker 1>and just cooks all of our satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire power grid.</v>

3416
02:32:52.170 --> 02:32:53.610
<v Speaker 1>We have to start from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're down.</v>

3417
02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:54.653
<v Speaker 1>No power.</v>

3418
02:32:55.020 --> 02:32:56.540
<v Speaker 2>The emp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3419
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:59.850
<v Speaker 2>We're in Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>BNP is real,</v>

3420
02:32:59.851 --> 02:33:04.200
<v Speaker 2>but I think you have to create so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>power to have one that big.</v>

3421
02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the limiting</v>

3422
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:09.000
<v Speaker 1>factor on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a guy in here,</v>

3423
02:33:09.001 --> 02:33:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Peter Schiff was here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this day,</v>

3424
02:33:11.071 --> 02:33:11.904
<v Speaker 1>this son brought darkness back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a blackout caused by solar </v>

3425
02:33:15.631 --> 02:33:17.460
<v Speaker 1>flare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was in the nineties,</v>

3426
02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:18.590
<v Speaker 1>89.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3427
02:33:18.600 --> 02:33:21.300
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entire province of Quebec,</v>

3428
02:33:21.301 --> 02:33:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Canada suffered an electrical power </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackout.</v>

3429
02:33:23.671 --> 02:33:24.504
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of blackouts occurred and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of North America every year they </v>

3430
02:33:27.001 --> 02:33:30.690
<v Speaker 1>go back back out was different because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one was caused by a solar storm.</v>

3431
02:33:30.720 --> 02:33:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently like what we're,</v>

3432
02:33:33.091 --> 02:33:33.924
<v Speaker 1>what we've tracked so far in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>solar activity is just a tiny fraction </v>

3433
02:33:38.731 --> 02:33:39.564
<v Speaker 1>of what the sun is capable of and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sun is capable of some pretty wild </v>

3434
02:33:42.391 --> 02:33:47.391
<v Speaker 1>variations and if those wild variations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it hits like a real odd end,</v>

3435
02:33:48.270 --> 02:33:50.690
<v Speaker 1>it could just fuck her entire system </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

3436
02:33:50.780 --> 02:33:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at the mercy of nature always,</v>

3437
02:33:53.210 --> 02:33:54.043
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how big our egos get over our </v>

3438
02:33:57.530 --> 02:33:59.720
<v Speaker 2>creations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we build,</v>

3439
02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:02.180
<v Speaker 2>nature's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3440
02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:04.580
<v Speaker 2>a wipe that shit out in a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

3441
02:34:04.581 --> 02:34:06.620
<v Speaker 2>Like there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to do a joke about that.</v>

3442
02:34:06.621 --> 02:34:08.360
<v Speaker 2>Like oh look at my beach house.</v>

3443
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:09.543
<v Speaker 1>She tells us I stayed at one for awhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>and at nighttime it reveals itself in </v>

3444
02:34:16.101 --> 02:34:16.934
<v Speaker 1>the daytime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks.</v>

3445
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Look at all that</v>

3446
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:20.230
<v Speaker 2>beautiful blue water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

3447
02:34:20.270 --> 02:34:25.270
<v Speaker 2>So pretty the ocean at night it is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>black munster space.</v>

3448
02:34:28.210 --> 02:34:31.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a dark monster because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>see anything and you realize like,</v>

3449
02:34:31.001 --> 02:34:31.834
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is fucking quadrillions of gallons </v>

3450
02:34:34.451 --> 02:34:35.284
<v Speaker 2>of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could just swallow up the entire </v>

3451
02:34:36.671 --> 02:34:38.890
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tons of weight and pressure,</v>

3452
02:34:39.190 --> 02:34:41.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like snow,</v>

3453
02:34:41.410 --> 02:34:42.900
<v Speaker 2>snow is the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3454
02:34:43.090 --> 02:34:46.750
<v Speaker 2>just shut everything down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a major snowfall,</v>

3455
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:47.823
<v Speaker 2>but you don't live next to snow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the fucked up thing about living </v>

3456
02:34:49.841 --> 02:34:52.330
<v Speaker 2>next to the ocean as a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're literally on the edge,</v>

3457
02:34:52.570 --> 02:34:55.240
<v Speaker 2>but you can live in one of those places </v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets hit with,</v>

3458
02:34:55.530 --> 02:34:57.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 feet of snow,</v>

3459
02:34:57.730 --> 02:34:59.890
<v Speaker 2>12 feet of snow and you're screwed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3460
02:34:59.891 --> 02:35:02.020
<v Speaker 2>But you could see that shit coming and </v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of dodge,</v>

3461
02:35:02.440 --> 02:35:03.273
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because the rich people live </v>

3462
02:35:07.451 --> 02:35:10.270
<v Speaker 2>on the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the same thing with earthquakes.</v>

3463
02:35:10.390 --> 02:35:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I told my mom a long time ago like she'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>be,</v>

3464
02:35:12.580 --> 02:35:13.420
<v Speaker 2>are you okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3465
02:35:13.421 --> 02:35:14.254
<v Speaker 2>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's hope one day I make enough money </v>

3466
02:35:16.150 --> 02:35:19.620
<v Speaker 2>to live somewhere I have to worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3467
02:35:19.690 --> 02:35:22.270
<v Speaker 2>fires or you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I live in the valley.</v>

3468
02:35:22.271 --> 02:35:23.104
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wish I wish I had to worry about </v>

3469
02:35:25.481 --> 02:35:26.650
<v Speaker 2>fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you keep water,</v>

3470
02:35:26.660 --> 02:35:30.010
<v Speaker 2>snow brush clearing a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't have a full kit.</v>

3471
02:35:30.011 --> 02:35:33.850
<v Speaker 2>I have a Red Cross kit and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>gallons of water.</v>

3472
02:35:33.851 --> 02:35:36.670
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna I'm gonna expand on that.</v>

3473
02:35:37.150 --> 02:35:40.180
<v Speaker 2>I have some food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some freeze dried food.</v>

3474
02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:41.313
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who went through Katrina told me </v>

3475
02:35:43.450 --> 02:35:45.040
<v Speaker 2>cash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cash.</v>

3476
02:35:45.310 --> 02:35:46.143
<v Speaker 2>He said keep cash in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said after Katrina milk was $100 a </v>

3477
02:35:49.241 --> 02:35:51.220
<v Speaker 2>gallon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100.</v>

3478
02:35:51.390 --> 02:35:53.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah.</v>

3479
02:35:53.531 --> 02:35:54.364
<v Speaker 2>He said you got to keep a large sum of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cash in the house as part of your </v>

3480
02:35:57.461 --> 02:35:59.400
<v Speaker 2>disaster kit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something I never would have thought.</v>

3481
02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:00.100
<v Speaker 2>But you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3482
02:36:00.100 --> 02:36:03.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The price of everything goes up and cash</v>

3483
02:36:03.841 --> 02:36:04.674
<v Speaker 2>is the only currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't use credit cards if </v>

3484
02:36:07.241 --> 02:36:08.074
<v Speaker 2>there's no electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't there an issue in Houston where </v>

3485
02:36:09.671 --> 02:36:12.860
<v Speaker 2>people are getting arrested for price </v>
<v Speaker 2>gouging on water and yeah,</v>

02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:19.690
<v Speaker 2>$100 a gallon for gas or something.</v>

3489
02:36:21.870 --> 02:36:26.110
<v Speaker 2>It's human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do with us?</v>

3490
02:36:26.730 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I wish we can wrap this up on a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>note,</v>

<v Speaker 2>This is a little thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what bothers me.</v>

3497
02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Don't.</v>

<v Speaker 2>People like it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like to press that button to see </v>

3503
02:36:53.590 --> 02:36:55.080
<v Speaker 2>someone almost held there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hold on.</v>

3504
02:36:55.120 --> 02:36:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you went away that.</v>

3505
02:36:56.770 --> 02:36:58.600
<v Speaker 2>That's how I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I'm changing the world,</v>

3506
02:36:58.601 --> 02:36:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how I'm cheap.</v>

3507
02:36:59.730 --> 02:37:01.840
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't solve gun violence.</v>

3508
02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:03.033
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't help with the football protests </v>

3509
02:37:04.631 --> 02:37:05.464
<v Speaker 2>or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can just not press the door </v>

3510
02:37:07.751 --> 02:37:09.280
<v Speaker 2>close button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a start.</v>

3511
02:37:09.460 --> 02:37:10.293
<v Speaker 2>But there are some dumb motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like four kids when the elevator's </v>

3512
02:37:14.051 --> 02:37:16.100
<v Speaker 2>completely packed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hold the door,</v>

3513
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:17.950
<v Speaker 3>hold the door.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like where are you going?</v>

3514
02:37:17.970 --> 02:37:19.280

<v Speaker 3>you are you going?</v>

3515
02:37:19.390 --> 02:37:20.223
<v Speaker 3>Where are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if your kid presses every button on </v>

3516
02:37:22.641 --> 02:37:25.610
<v Speaker 3>the elevator and he accidentally takes </v>
<v Speaker 3>one to the head,</v>

3517
02:37:25.880 --> 02:37:27.710
<v Speaker 3>we can't be held responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>

3518
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.903
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not saying that he's had his elbow </v>

3519
02:37:30.561 --> 02:37:31.394
<v Speaker 3>height.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just moving that saying that got </v>

3520
02:37:33.111 --> 02:37:36.020
<v Speaker 3>in the way of just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stay away from the door closed,</v>

3521
02:37:36.021 --> 02:37:37.310
<v Speaker 3>but don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plus that door.</v>

3522
02:37:37.370 --> 02:37:38.600
<v Speaker 3>Close button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nice gentlemen.</v>

3523
02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:41.540
<v Speaker 3>That's a strong advice from Alonzo </v>
<v Speaker 3>Bowden.</v>

3524
02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:44.930
<v Speaker 3>It's the wings of a butterfly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually become a hurricane.</v>

3525
02:37:46.050 --> 02:37:48.740
<v Speaker 3>You letting someone in that elevator </v>
<v Speaker 3>might change the course of history.</v>

3526
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when Peter Parker left,</v>

3527
02:37:52.611 --> 02:37:55.160
<v Speaker 3>that burglar passed by and it killed his</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncle Ben.</v>

3528
02:37:55.460 --> 02:37:57.200
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then the tournament of Spiderman.</v>

3529
02:37:57.201 --> 02:37:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3530
02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Strong words.</v>

3531
02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:01.810
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both ladies.</v>

3532
02:38:01.830 --> 02:38:03.320
<v Speaker 3>Gentlemen begs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you brother.</v>
