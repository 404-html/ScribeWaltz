00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.880
Hello freaks.
Are we on?

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.470
I don't see it doesn't show to me silly Ustream.

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.290
What the fuck is going on ladies and gentlemen?

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.620
Yeah.
Today's podcast brought to you by [inaudible] Dot com that's o.

5
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:23.440
N.
N.
I.
T.
Um,

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.580
we just started getting these new things in that aren't not weapons.
Okay.

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.950
And uh,
Brian keeps accusing them.

8
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.660
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.750
<v 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.720
being weapons just because their clubs and Macy's just because it would really

11
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:40.100
help you if the,
if the apocalypse went down and we went back to sword fighting.

12
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.790
Okay.

13
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.210
You would want to use one of these steel maces that we're carrying around these

14
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.080
days.
We're selling these club bells and steel maces and of course kettle bells.

15
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.580
What all these things are his functional strength equipment.

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.200
And there's two things that are super important to know when you're doing any

17
00:00:57.201 --> 00:01:01.640
kind of weightlifting.
And one is the correct form.
I can't stress this enough.

18
00:01:01.641 --> 00:01:05.360
If you can afford it,
hire a trainer.
You only have to do it like once.

19
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:06.051
Pay Attention,

20
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.520
write shit down and tell him to give you three or four simple exercises,

21
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.660
clean press,

22
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:16.580
real simple things to know about where to place your weight and how to keep your

23
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:20.180
posture.
No those,
study those and live by those.

24
00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.180
It's one of the most important things about strength training.
Don't be an idiot.

25
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.990
Use proper discipline and use proper form.
Cause if you don't,

26
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:30.440
you're going to get hurt.
Okay?
That's number one.
And number two,

27
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:32.030
if you want to get in serious shape,

28
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:36.020
there is no better exercises than exercises that use your whole body.

29
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.950
Those are the kinds of exercises that when you,
you,

30
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.940
you take it and you can translate it almost immediately to any sort of athletic

31
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:48.790
activity.
Whereas like muscle specific exercises like bench press or you know,

32
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.990
or curls more,
you know,
along those lines,
those,
they make your arms bigger,

33
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:55.220
they make it a little stronger,

34
00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:59.600
but it's not the same as working your whole body in one as one group.

35
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:00.860
That's what kettlebells are all about.

36
00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:04.200
That's what these steel Macy's are all about.
And,
um,
uh,

37
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.540
we have medicine balls and those kind of activities are the activities that

38
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:11.450
translate into everyday life and to sports.

39
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.900
So that's the kind of shit we sell along with different,

40
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.720
the best protein powder you can buy ham force protein powder,

41
00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:22.110
different supplements,
but brain supplements,
endurance supplements,
uh,

42
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.240
immune system supplements,
all literally the best shit we can get our hands on.

43
00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.000
We sell it to you.
Killer be hunting.
We don't give a fuck.
Okay.

44
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.130
We're selling killer bee honey.
We're jacking killer bees,

45
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.380
taking their honey and then selling it.
And a,

46

That American comedy company is a sweet little spot down in San Diego.

69
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.500
<v 1>Shane Smith,
ladies and gentlemen,
the powerful Shane Smith of vice.com,</v>

70
00:03:55.501 --> 00:03:58.920
one of my favorite human beings on the face of the earth.
And you are here,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.300
It is a pleasure.
Thank you.

72
00:04:00.301 --> 00:04:04.050
I was just going to say whatever powders and supplements you're selling,

73
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.620
I'm buying because you're fucking Jack.
Shit Dude.

74
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.770
Looking very sexy,
right?
Shit.
Fucking kettlebells.
Get some sun.

75
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.300
Uh,
I haven't,

76
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.410
I was telling you haven't done Jujitsu in several months because of my back and

77
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:22.410
I feel I've never felt better.
It's amazing taking time off.

78
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.670
Jujitsu just does a body great.
So brutal.
It just,
it breaks you down.

79
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.760
It's so like everybody who does it,
he's always walking around like Ah,

80
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.170
something elbow.
Your knees fucked up your Ankle Jack,
you should have tapped.

81
00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:37.670
Your wrist is fucked up.
Like everywhere you go it's,
but it's so,

82
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.930
it's so much fun.
I like to do it.

83
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.520
People like sort of sacrifice parts of their body up to a certain point.

84
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.870
The spine is a real issue though.
That's a scary one,
right?
You know,

85
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.150
back issues or how's your spine?
What's fine?
It's is a,

86
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.550
a minor bulge and it's getting better through I'm,
I'm doing this,

87
00:04:56.551 --> 00:05:00.660
I'm disc decompression therapy where they hook you up to a machine and they
like,

88
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.250
it's like the slow pulling and pushing where it's slowly like separates your

89
00:05:05.251 --> 00:05:08.550
spine.
And right now it's only like 19 pounds,
which sounds like a lot,

90
00:05:08.551 --> 00:05:11.130
but it doesn't feel like anything back talk is so hot right now.

91
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.070
Doing a lot of backtalk lately.
Yeah.
I don't know why man.
It's on my mind.
No,

92
00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.270
I fucked up my back,

93
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:22.260
but it's a supposedly the bottom left is fucking killing me.

94
00:05:22.261 --> 00:05:24.750
It's either my intestines or there's something wrong with my back.

95
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.390
You got an eight son?
Yeah,
it might be.
That's where it starts.

96
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.420
It starts right there.
You Rub maps.
Um,
you know,

97
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:32.370
bas Rutten scared the shit out of me the other day.

98
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.030
That scared the shit out of me.
He's on his arm scaring the shit out of me.

99
00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.710
Bosses had two neck surgeries and he's not getting signals to his right arm.

100
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.180
So his right arm shriveled up and they just recently fuse three of the discs in

101
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:46.014
his neck.

102
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.710
So this is a second surgery he's had on his neck and then the other day his arm

103
00:05:49.711 --> 00:05:52.170
failed on them so there's another blockage so they have to go,

104
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:56.250
go in and figure out where the nerves are blocked.
Like that's scary shit.

105
00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.980
He couldn't pick up a gallon of milk.

106
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.000
<v 3>That's how bad it was.
He's,
yeah,
I have a,
a friend of mine who,</v>

107
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.200
I have a place in Costa Rica,

108
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:07.040
a little surf shack and he went over on a wave and broke his neck in,

109
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.020
in the water broke and I came up with neglect and about three years ago I in the

110
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:16.790
exact same place,
went over,
came up like rubbed my face off like on the,

111
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.570
on the bottom and my neck hurt.
I went in to get a cat scan.
They're like,
yeah,

112
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:23.660
you have a hairline fracture,
you broke your neck three years ago.

113
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.760
And I've just been walking around going,
yeah,
I'm a Knicks a bit stiff.

114
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.510
<v 4>Wow.
My God,
how bad ass or you know,</v>

115
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.220
whatever.
Fucking us in there for like four months gone.
Yeah,

116
00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.780
I can't really move it,
but you know,
whatever.
I'm not a pussy,

117
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.580
just walking around with a broken neck.
Well,

118
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.560
the other thing is I would use your fucking kettlebells,
whatever you journey.

119
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.423
We can just,

120
00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.410
<v 3>we,
uh,
uh,
talking about all of our ill,</v>

121
00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:52.530
I have a helmet headed,
a helmet,

122
00:06:52.531 --> 00:06:54.600
headed flesh eating parasite in my colon.

123
00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.560
<v 4>Well,
I was supposed to get my hernia.
You,
you're like,
yeah,
no,</v>

124
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.910
it's supposed to get my hernia fixed.

125
00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.880
<v 3>Right.
And so I was scheduled for surgery to get my hernia fixed.</v>

126
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.630
And then I went to a tropical disease doctor and they're like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

127
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.830
If they push on that hernia,
you've got a fucker living in your bowels.
And if it,

128
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.170
if it,
if it,
if you push it onto it,

129
00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:19.860
it'll perforate your bowels and you could die because this fucker's wedged in

130
00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:20.850
there eating your flesh.

131
00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.440
<v 4>Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.</v>

132
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:27.740
There's something alive inside of me.
Like more,
I took lots of pill,

133
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:30.020
but it's like alien.
How big was it?

134
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.080
<v 3>Well,
I,
I'm going to be honest,</v>

135
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.360
I didn't look at my shit for three weeks because I was like,

136
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:36.700
I didn't want to see the fucker come out.

137
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.800
<v 4>Why?
Why wouldn't you want to know what that looks like?</v>

138
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:42.350
You've been all over the way that you've been to Karachi.

139
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.420
Mary's or mainly say that but these you say that but these things,

140
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.180
these things would make me not want to fuck.

141
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.420
Every year is not a fucking army of humans to keep me from looking at that shit.

142
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.050
I would have to note that fucking thing growing in my pilot.

143
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:02.600
You would not go anywhere else man.
That's,
that's so scary.

144
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:04.760
That's one of those things that show,

145
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:08.420
what does that show that the hidden enemy or something like that where people

146
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:12.410
get parasites.
It's man,
can't forget the name of it.

147
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.680
I wouldn't want to see it either cause you can't unsee that.

148
00:08:14.681 --> 00:08:17.710
That shit will be in a while and see it.
I don't want to see it man.
I want to,

149
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.950
I want to see every time you

150
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.650
<v 3>go to anywhere and have a glass of water or eat anything,
you're just thinking,</v>

151
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:25.300
fuck I just got another one of those fuckers.

152
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.510
<v 4>Oh my God.
How can you test for this?
Like,</v>

153
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:31.940
cause I feel like I've had a million you should go

154
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.990
because I had bad Sushi wants it,
wants,

155
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.130
my stomach was fucked up and you should go.
You should go because

156
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:44.030
<v 3>you'd get a Roto rooter go up there and usually like there's some Amoebas or</v>

157
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:45.810
there's some shit going on.
This one's the next

158
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.910
<v 4>you allowed to beat off while they're doing this.</v>

159
00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.770
If you're just listening to the doctors

160
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.560
<v 3>like 90 years old,
but they won't even notice.
But have you rubbed maps?</v>

161
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:56.040
They might have

162
00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.610
<v 5>this on.
It was a,
it was apparently quite as special.
A special pair of,</v>

163
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:05.550
so I didn't,
I didn't want to see large,
large and,
and uh,
they look,

164
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.710
they look,
they look bad.
They look like an alien and the alien,

165
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:15.150
the Alien Ray Geiger.
Hr Giger,
yeah.

166
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:18.810
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Dude.
What the fuck?
Well,
you know,

167
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:19.710
you're getting old when you're like,

168
00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:23.490
I can't get my hernia operated on because the fucking parasites are too big.

169
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:26.820
That's not,
you know,
you're getting old,
you know,

170
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:31.620
you've eaten food rotten on the side of the road in the strangest parts of the

171
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:35.280
world.
It's actually kind of amazing that you're as healthy as you are when you

172
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:38.970
consider all the different nutty places ain't gone,
you know,

173
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.460
fucking healthiest shit.
We're just going to see fairly often.

174
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.100
Let's not blow each other.
Um,
the,
the,

175
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.240
the idea of eating food and all these different places,

176
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.440
did it ever bother you before you had this parasite?
You know,

177
00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.690
stupidly I eat street,
me and I eat fucking Oh,
fucking club.

178
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.890
They're doing it.
You'll do it.
Right.
How bombs in Afghanistan,
they're done.

179
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.510
And then what are they?
Who knows?
Right.
Well who knows what to keep.

180
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.820
I remember somebody said to me the first time I went to Afghanistan,

181
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:10.980
they were like,
don't whatever you do,
don't drink the green tea.

182
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:14.010
Cause they give you green tea everywhere you go.
But the problem is,

183
00:10:14.011 --> 00:10:17.850
is if you refuse the green tea,
it's sort of like in a front,
it's like,

184
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.790
why?
Why would you not drink the green tea?

185
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:25.080
Because the water is very bad and maybe they didn't boil it.

186
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:30.390
And so it's very,
very bad for you.
And,
but if you,
if you say no,

187
00:10:30.391 --> 00:10:35.310
it's like saying fuck you,
right?
You got to teach.
So savages about boiling water.

188
00:10:35.311 --> 00:10:38.240
So listen,
listen,
wow.
Who'd be friends here?
We can be friends here.

189
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.970
Who knows what it is?
Basic motherfuckers make teeth basically.

190
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.470
It's the same thing.
Like when I was in Sudan,
they give you these like,
you know,

191
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:47.970
drinks like pomegranate juice,

192
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.150
but they've had just added water to it and then you're like,
you can't,

193
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:55.260
it's it really bad to say no and,
and,
and you're just like,

194
00:10:55.261 --> 00:10:59.070
I can't say yes to anything.
And then explosive diarrhea,

195
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.880
is that what it is?
Well,
or is it worse?
I actually,

196
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.410
the tweets that I get the most response,
or like Shane's law,
which is,
you know,

197
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.820
the more you need a toilet,

198
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:13.980
the ratio is directly proportionate to how bad that toilet will be.

199
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:18.690
So for example,
when you have explosive diarrhea in west Africa,
guess what?

200
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.520
That toilet is just arking ropes of shit and Piss.
And whereas,

201
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.420
whereas in Sweden,
when you're having one lovely,

202
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:31.800
beautiful log and then one wipe wonder,
they have perfect,
beautiful,

203
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:34.560
clean toilet.
The smell of Jasmine,
you know?

204
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.130
And so that's literally like Murphy's law.
Shane's law is,

205
00:11:38.131 --> 00:11:41.850
you know how bad you need to take a shit is directly proportionate to how bad

206
00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:46.570
that toad it's going to.
Oh yeah.
Those trucks,
top toilets was once he goes,
stop,

207
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:51.420
pull it in west Africa,
what it must be like,
just holes in the ground.
Right.

208
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.190
Well actually are bad.
You can't actually get,

209
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.350
I personally can't even get into the room,
so I'll go outside into the bushes.

210
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.250
Oh Jesus Christ.
People are so fucking

211
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:06.750
<v 6>gross at our lowest level were so disgusting.
You know,</v>

212
00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:11.000
like when you're at a concert and you go to a porter potty and this line of

213
00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:15.750
people shitting into a pocket of blue water,
still bucket of blue water,

214
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.180
we're all pretending it's okay.
And as we walk up where

215
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.830
<v 5>you would have figured all of our technology,</v>

216
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:23.680
we could have figured out something better.

217
00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.400
The only guys who really got assessed to the Japanese cars,
they have,
you know,

218
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.870
music.
Yeah.

219
00:12:28.871 --> 00:12:33.871
And Fragrances and spray heated rings and they're really into their sort of

220
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.380
pleasure shitting.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
They truly are.
Yeah.

221
00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.030
But the,
uh,
the people that have to shit into a hole in the ground,

222
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.860
well holding the ground would be better than,
than,
than,
than,
than,
uh,

223
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:51.310
than a toilet that's just fucking overflowing.
Yeah,
it's true.
Yeah.

224
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:55.630
It's been baking in the sun,
I think.
Shy,
as long as it's a nice deep hole.

225
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.590
But then you worry about losing your watch,
you know,
like if some freak accident,

226
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:01.570
I don't know what you're doing down there.

227
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.370
You're watching some freak wiping accident.
You hit a route

228
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.790
<v 6>near the whole or it's one of those sinkholes.
Oh,</v>

229
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.160
that's a very good point.
Very good point.
Um,

230
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.570
that fucking sinkhole thing in Florida freak right now,

231
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.380
that scared the shit out of him.
Yeah,
that's a terrifying thing.
Yes.

232
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:20.550
They're fucking house.

233
00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:24.750
Just a hole opened up underneath it and apparently it happens so often and have

234
00:13:24.751 --> 00:13:28.440
Florida that you have to get insurance for if you have homeowners insurance.

235
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.450
But that's a good horror movie,
man.

236
00:13:33.451 --> 00:13:34.380
That is the craziest.

237
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.820
<v 5>Please.
There's a,
there's a big slum in Mexico that was built on a,</v>

238
00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:39.961
on a dump.

239
00:13:39.961 --> 00:13:43.470
And the reason why it was a dump was because magically if you put your garbage

240
00:13:43.471 --> 00:13:47.290
there,
which is a beer because,
because it was a swamp,
it was like this.

241
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:53.140
And so they kept just sort of dumping stuff and then as the garbage got got

242
00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.830
hired,
they sort of started building houses on it and now,

243
00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:00.040
but now like 100,000 people live there.
It's like a city but it's built on,

244
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:04.230
on garbage on the dump.
But th th the garbage was in a sinkhole.

245
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.780
So every once in a while they won't just have one or two houses.

246
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.370
They'll have like 10 houses just go.
Yup.

247
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:13.710
<v 6>Oh
yeah.
What the fuck?
Yeah.</v>

248
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.950
And it's weird how weird in uniform the holes.

249
00:14:16.951 --> 00:14:19.820
Look Brian,

250
00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.080
pull up some of the photos cause you can't believe it.

251
00:14:22.081 --> 00:14:26.760
I think the big one was in Guatemala where it started swallowing up entire

252
00:14:26.761 --> 00:14:30.810
blocks.
It's insane.
It just doesn't look real.

253
00:14:30.811 --> 00:14:32.010
It's like a horror movie.

254
00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.870
It's like all the sudden where your house is is a cliff going down and

255
00:14:36.871 --> 00:14:39.210
everyone's walking around the edges looking down,

256
00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:42.390
not knowing when it's going to expand,
if it's going to expand,

257
00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.170
if it's gonna stay that way permanently and there,
look at that.

258
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.480
Look at that dude.
Come on.

259
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:51.460
That looks like a fucking meteor came from the moon,
sir,

260
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.060
and slammed into the earth.

261
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.000
<v 3>We went to one of those in,
in Libya where they,</v>

262
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.930
they actually have like cars or whatever or junk cars and they throw it in

263
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.420
because you can't hear it land.

264
00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.493
<v 6>It's so deep</v>

265
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.400
<v 3>here at land.
So they,
it's like a thing.
It's like it's,
you know,
oh,
you're here.</v>

266
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:10.500
Let's go throw something into the bottomless pit.

267
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.120
<v 6>How could they stand near that thing?</v>

268
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.320
How could they be sure that stable?

269
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.560
<v 3>We read through like some,
I dunno,
metal rods,
whatever.</v>

270
00:15:20.561 --> 00:15:24.100
We listened and you literally can't hear it hit.
That's how deep it is.

271
00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.110
<v 6>My balls hurt.
You just sang that my ball started hurting,</v>

272
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.190
my ass started crumbling and Twitter,
I'm squeezing my toes.

273
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:37.410
What the fuck,
man?
Why does that happen?
They don't know.
Right?

274
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.480
They're not entirely sure.
Is that the case?

275
00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:42.630
They use a variety of factors and aliens land in it and then when they called it

276
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.493
a sinkhole,

277
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.730
<v 3>I think it's Illumio clay is,
is is,</v>

278
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:50.490
it's a lot of cities are built on beside rivers and those rivers used to be

279
00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:54.510
bigger and so there's this Illumio clay which is unstable and it just sinks
down,

280
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.080
<v 6>but it sinks down like 102 hundred 57 times.</v>

281
00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.340
What the fuck man?
Or is a big one there?
Yeah,
Jesus Christ.

282
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:05.280
At least you could see the bottom of that one scared me.

283
00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:10.050
All those people standing over there.
What the anywhere near that thing.

284
00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:11.790
Who knows what's going to happen

285
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:18.300
just when it comes to the earth swallowing you.
Yeah,
I'm a little,

286
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.720
you know there's spots where that never happens.
I said go to those spots,

287
00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:22.650
but you live in La.

288
00:16:22.651 --> 00:16:27.270
I mean you're running shake a little rock and roll.

289
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.990
We'll be fine.
This shit never happens out here.
Oh look at that city.

290
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:33.150
It's just a big hole in it now that I said it never happens.

291
00:16:33.151 --> 00:16:36.990
You know it's coming.
That's a pretty hot and people are going to blame me.
Wow.

292
00:16:36.991 --> 00:16:41.700
Look at that whole holy fuck yeah.
You know,
a single floor dwelling,

293
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.000
very important,
a good move if you can afford it.
Um,
I think that's really the,

294
00:16:46.001 --> 00:16:49.590
the safest thing and make sure your house is up to code and then you got to

295
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.590
build it into like a mountain side.
Like doctor,
no,

296
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.720
it's very possibly shit's going to get fucked up.

297
00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:58.650
It's really all about staying alive and you got to think really realistically,

298
00:16:58.651 --> 00:16:59.880
you've got to think,
if you live here,

299
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.290
it's very possible that every couple decades or so,

300
00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.850
the fucking earth cracks the foundation of your house and your plumbing is

301
00:17:08.851 --> 00:17:12.780
spraying water into the street and your power's out for a month.

302
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:17.520
You gotta be willing to accept that that's possible.
You are prepper.
No,
no.

303
00:17:17.521 --> 00:17:22.500
I'm prepared slightly.
I'm prepared for like a few,
a few months of bullshit,

304
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.940
you know,
but I'm not like a stock and dried meat or anything.
Nothing.

305
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:32.090
I just think that there's no way that with all the possibilities of natural

306
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:37.260
disasters that we really don't take any consideration because the extent of our

307
00:17:37.261 --> 00:17:41.280
history of like what we really know about what's taking place on the earth and

308
00:17:41.281 --> 00:17:45.510
the amount of devastation that can occur over an enormous period of time.

309
00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.710
Billions and billions of years where all these unique events which have been

310
00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:54.270
documented throughout history where they're just starting to understand what

311
00:17:54.271 --> 00:17:58.560
caused certain geographic features and what kind of cataclysmic affecting

312
00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:58.980
yesterday

313
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:02.510
<v 3>gone up over a Russia.
We missed two after that.</v>

314
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.750
I wouldn't say I'm not a prepper,
but I will say this,
you know,
in,
in,
in,

315
00:18:07.751 --> 00:18:10.970
in northern Canada,
they have these millions and millions of lakes,

316
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.630
like freshwater's nobody on them and know you can get to them all the things and

317
00:18:14.631 --> 00:18:18.990
you're like,
if you have a few bucks stashed away and you can build like a,

318
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:20.960
you know,
a cottage on one of these fuckers with,

319
00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.540
with pure water and stock them up,

320
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:27.470
you'd be stupid not to because if shit goes down right and you've got this lake

321
00:18:27.471 --> 00:18:31.460
and this thing and it's hard to get to and all this stuff,
then then you can,

322
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.190
you can get the fuck up there.
It's just,
it's like hedging your bets.

323
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.620
You're just hedging your bets.
And the thing,

324
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.580
the only problem with it is if she does go down,
how the fuck you get up there.

325
00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:41.890
<v 6>That's the issue.</v>

326
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.940
Well I think you should have a little bit of food at your house and your also

327
00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:50.580
try growing your food if you can.
If you have a small patch in your backyard,

328
00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:53.490
you'd be amazed what you can do with like pots.
We,
you know,

329
00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.010
we started growing our stuff in pots,
you know,
just like large pots.
Right.

330
00:18:57.011 --> 00:18:59.200
And you can grow like big vegetable plants.

331
00:18:59.201 --> 00:19:01.450
You can get a lot of vegetables just from your garden.

332
00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:04.960
<v 3>Well we were just,
we were,
we were doing this,
a story on the world is sinking,</v>

333
00:19:04.961 --> 00:19:06.730
you know,
we went to the Maldives,
went to Venice,

334
00:19:06.731 --> 00:19:09.940
we went to Greenland and then we were in New York City and actually interviewed

335
00:19:09.941 --> 00:19:14.220
the deputy mayor and,
and I said,
you know,
you know sandy hit and,

336
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:19.150
and it was bad but you know,
it wasn't,
it was,
it was pretty fucking bad.

337
00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:21.710
Like I was outside of my house,
you know,

338
00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:26.730
waist high and water had a video of you stop watering by the Hudson right.

339
00:19:28.061 --> 00:19:32.410
By my house yet.
So just floating hundreds of rats are shooting by.

340
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.730
But in a current,
can you pull that video up?
Cause the,
the images in occurrence,

341
00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.470
that search warrant and a rat.
What is the,
a video,
what was the name of it?

342
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.050
Well that's for the HBO show.
So we haven't released it yet.

343
00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:47.290
But you showed it to me.
Yeah,
I showed it to you.
You son of a bitch.

344
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.260
I can't put it online.
We can't show the people.
What about the people,

345
00:19:50.261 --> 00:19:52.860
the good people out there,
the folks that are not privileged.
Yeah.

346
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:56.080
So Hudson went to to to,
to west Broadway and,

347
00:19:56.081 --> 00:19:59.440
and I was sitting there and doing the standup and and all these,
you know,

348
00:19:59.441 --> 00:20:01.660
rats are going by and,
and whatever.
But the thing,

349
00:20:01.661 --> 00:20:05.770
what's interesting about New York was that it fuck shit up pretty bad.

350
00:20:05.771 --> 00:20:10.080
But the fact is it's,
there was no gas.
You couldn't get gas.
No.
What it was,

351
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.670
it was like lineups and get gas.
The whole city,
you know,

352
00:20:12.671 --> 00:20:14.350
it wasn't sure to shut down gas wise.

353
00:20:14.351 --> 00:20:17.890
People are trying to get out and then you realize we're like one centimeter away

354
00:20:17.891 --> 00:20:20.260
from everything fucking collapsing because you're like,

355
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:24.190
oh sure I got my fucking bolt hole up in Canada on the lake that stocked with

356
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.570
shotguns and time,
eat peas and seeds and then you're like,

357
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.660
how the fuck am I going to get there when there's no god damn gas.

358
00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.640
And by the way,
you know,

359
00:20:33.641 --> 00:20:36.220
you can't get out to the bridges and you can't get out of the tunnels.

360
00:20:36.221 --> 00:20:39.040
The tunnels are fucking flooded.
And at that point you're sort of saying,

361
00:20:39.041 --> 00:20:41.350
well I don't know what you're prepping for.

362
00:20:41.351 --> 00:20:46.210
But if something bad like really cataclysmic happens worse,
we're fucked.

363
00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.850
So in the,
I have some fun.

364
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.490
<v 1>Yeah.
Have some fun as good.
Um,
be nice.
That's good to know.</v>

365
00:20:53.491 --> 00:20:55.200
So that when the shit hits the fan,

366
00:20:55.201 --> 00:20:58.800
people want to show you where their basement is with their canned tomatoes,

367
00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:02.280
you know,
you can develop a real sense of community.

368
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.310
It would actually be kind of something refreshing if you can actually ensure

369
00:21:05.311 --> 00:21:10.311
that you weren't going to get attacked by roving hordes of outlaws that had

370
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.420
given up on society and it started robbing people.
But if we could,
you know,

371
00:21:14.490 --> 00:21:16.830
if we had something to,
to,

372
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.110
not necessarily something that kills a bunch of people,

373
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.960
but something that gets everybody's scared enough to bond together.

374
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:25.590
We're really getting dark,
really quick.
Dark man.
We're like,

375
00:21:25.591 --> 00:21:28.800
we went from zero to 60 years,
brother.
I don't even think it's getting dark.

376
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.520
I really don't,
brother,
let me tell you.
I don't,
I don't think it's getting dark.

377
00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.493
That's the thing.

378
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:34.760
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

379
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:39.080
It used to be communities banded together to defend themselves from everybody

380
00:21:39.081 --> 00:21:41.720
else who was trying to fuck them up.
That's the history of mankind.

381
00:21:41.721 --> 00:21:44.290
That's why we're fighting all the time is because they were trying,

382
00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:46.730
there was only a certain amount of carrots and they're trying to get your

383
00:21:46.731 --> 00:21:48.830
carrots and you've got to defend your carrots and your kids can eat,

384
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.640
so it wasn't continual warfare and that was the community all supporting each

385
00:21:52.641 --> 00:21:53.000
other.

386
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.180
<v 1>That's also why we have this tremendous desire to be around each other.</v>

387
00:21:56.181 --> 00:22:00.160
This two men,
tremendous desire for community.
For Fellowship.
Exactly.

388
00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.250
It's a part of our DNA.

389
00:22:01.251 --> 00:22:04.670
That's why one of the worst things a person can be punished with solitary

390
00:22:04.671 --> 00:22:05.690
confinement.
Exactly right.

391
00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:08.990
It drives him nuts is what we have in literally drives and we literally drives

392
00:22:08.991 --> 00:22:09.580
him nuts.

393
00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:13.000
I said it just like you because you're Canadian and I wanted to be copper.
It's,

394
00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.440
it's,

395
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:18.290
there's a horrific thing that happens to the mind when it's tortured without

396
00:22:18.291 --> 00:22:23.270
human contact and you long for it because we really are not individuals.

397
00:22:23.271 --> 00:22:25.070
So we're,
uh,
we're fibbers,

398
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:29.180
we pretend that we're rugged individualists so that we push forward,
uh,
you know,

399
00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:33.500
an ego and a,
and a legacy and conquer and all that nonsense.

400
00:22:33.501 --> 00:22:37.700
But at the end of the day,
you,
you must be around other people.
That's true.

401
00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.580
I'm sorry.
Just said you go now,
please.
I mean,
you know,
I said it already.

402
00:22:43.581 --> 00:22:44.280
I'm verbose.

403
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.230
<v 3>Well,
my thing is,
you know,
we're,
uh,
we're learned species,
we learn most things,</v>

404
00:22:49.231 --> 00:22:53.070
but we are hardwired for,
for three basic things,
which is survive,

405
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:54.750
which is why people commit suicide.

406
00:22:54.751 --> 00:22:57.540
They figure are crazy because you're going against your hard wiring.

407
00:22:57.541 --> 00:23:00.180
So it's survive,
procreate,
right?

408
00:23:00.181 --> 00:23:02.730
So we're hardwired to procreate and then protect the project.

409
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.800
So at the end you sit there and say,
okay,

410
00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.750
if you're talking about protect the progeny,

411
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.260
history makes sense because that means if you're in these villages,

412
00:23:10.261 --> 00:23:11.960
everyone sort of intermingle,
you know,

413
00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.000
like your cousin and me and we're in and everybody,

414
00:23:15.001 --> 00:23:16.500
all the kids are there and they're all planning.

415
00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.220
So then you would fight to the death to protect the progeny cause that's

416
00:23:20.221 --> 00:23:23.310
hardwired into our spinal fucking call.
Right?
So,

417
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:28.050
so that's why we have this innate desire to form these communities and to

418
00:23:28.051 --> 00:23:32.040
protect these communities and I,
and and that's been the history of,
of,

419
00:23:32.041 --> 00:23:32.760
of humankind.

420
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.630
It's only when sort of the nation state came and sort of had these supernational

421
00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:41.550
entities guaranteed security theoretically that that politics and modern in the

422
00:23:41.551 --> 00:23:42.480
modern form started.

423
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:46.130
But before that it was just about we're going to protect our,
yeah,
I

424
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:51.130
<v 6>think if we could figure out how to truly recognize that all all people that can</v>

425
00:23:52.251 --> 00:23:56.060
speak English and that can follow a certain ethic just to,

426
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:59.840
just to be cool to people and just be friendly and be nice to be bold.

427
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.740
Just that attitude alone,
if that,
if that is possible to change,

428
00:24:03.741 --> 00:24:08.480
if it's possible to peel people psychologically enough to where they don't lash

429
00:24:08.481 --> 00:24:11.630
out at others,
like for whatever reason for their own mistakes,

430
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:13.400
for their own insecurities,

431
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:16.280
for their own fucked up childhood that they had no control over whatever it is,

432
00:24:16.281 --> 00:24:16.910
the cost,

433
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:20.660
and we could figure out a way to communicate with those people and settle

434
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:21.800
everybody the fuck down.

435
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.610
I think you could make a tremendous difference in how this world is run.
I mean,

436
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:28.820
I think we're literally that close to it.
We,

437
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.200
the number one thing that was missing throughout all of human history was the

438
00:24:33.201 --> 00:24:36.470
ability for all of us,
all of us to have a say,

439
00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.580
all of us to be able to express ourselves,
all of us,
to connect all of us,

440
00:24:40.581 --> 00:24:44.840
to figure out how to get information to and with no boundaries as far as like

441
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.340
some countries and time limp zones and and internet connections.

442
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:54.350
It's so free now that I feel like there's never been a time like this before

443
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:58.700
where people might have a chance of taking a step back.

444
00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:03.980
It's just overcoming the amount of momentum that's behind it as far as tradition

445
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:07.820
and government and rules and regulations and how we've always done things and,

446
00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.820
but if we could ever,
if we could just relax,

447
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:14.690
if everybody could just relax and understand that there's no secrets anymore as

448
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:18.980
far as where the oil comes from or where the money goes or whether it's no,

449
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.230
everybody can prosper.

450
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.260
There can be a way where instead of being insanely overbalanced where the money

451
00:25:26.721 --> 00:25:29.150
is going to these foreign banks and all this crazy shit,

452
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.100
you guys would be happier to you.

453
00:25:32.101 --> 00:25:37.101
Super rich guys if you had less money but no evil Karma to go with it.

454
00:25:37.131 --> 00:25:40.070
I'm not you.
I'm talking about like banker type characters.

455
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:44.420
If you're a banker and you're one of those evil concept has a house in the

456
00:25:44.421 --> 00:25:46.340
Hamptons and you have,
you know,

457
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.210
these people that are around you all the time and you've made $1 billion by

458
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:55.250
finagling your way through Wall Street and you're just this maniacal Gordon

459
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.570
Gekko type character,
you failed you,
you,

460
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:04.571
you got into a crazy game and you sort of decided that the numbers were more

461
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:09.140
important than people and some how.

462
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:13.700
Somewhere along the line you figured out a way to manipulate it to the point

463
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:17.570
where you're like,
what was his name?
The dude murder Madoff.
Bernie Madoff,

464
00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:20.390
Bernie Madoff.
It where you just,
you don't give a fuck.

465
00:26:20.391 --> 00:26:23.510
You're just stealing money from the system,
pulling it out.

466
00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.470
<v 3>I definitely agree with you that look,
it's all within our own.</v>

467
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:31.500
I think somewhere along the line we forgot that it's in our power to do shit.

468
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.340
Yeah.
It's,
it's up to us to do shit.
And,
and I think that,
you know,

469
00:26:36.341 --> 00:26:40.600
humans generally are capable of,
of incredibly,

470
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:45.010
you know,
I mean,
you see heroes every and incredibly sort of heroic feats and,

471
00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:48.240
and,
and,
and community sticking together and humanities digging me out,

472
00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.103
all this stuff.

473
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:54.060
We're all so sadly capable of the most disgusting shit that you can fucking

474
00:26:54.061 --> 00:26:56.370
possibly imagine.
And the,
the,

475
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:00.000
the problem that I have with what we're doing at vice now with our news and what

476
00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:01.740
we're doing with the HBO show is,
you know,

477
00:27:01.741 --> 00:27:04.290
we're going out into the world and we're seeing all this shit and you're like,

478
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:09.090
holy fuck,
we're fucking,
we can do some really,
really bad shit.

479
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.260
And I think that as people do bad shit,

480
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:18.000
it collectively brings humanity down,
right?
When you're using child,
you know,

481
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.390
children six,
seven,
eight years old to be suicide bombers or assassins,

482
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.420
that's collectively bringing humanity down.

483
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:27.000
And I believe what we have to do is we have to stomp that out.

484
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.110
We cannot let that fucking go on because,

485
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:33.060
because of modern day politics,

486
00:27:33.061 --> 00:27:37.620
what happens is these kinds of of of heinous crimes are being,
you know,

487
00:27:37.621 --> 00:27:41.640
sort of perpetrated all the time now.
And it's,
it's,
it's,

488
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.660
it's detrimental to humanity as a,
as a,
as a whole.

489
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.960
<v 1>Unquestionably.
No,
I think no one could argue that the,
um,
the,</v>

490
00:27:49.961 --> 00:27:53.740
the real question is how to go about doing it and is,
is the,

491
00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.510
the threat of that is,
it,

492
00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:00.650
<v 3>is,
it,
is it cultivated?
But you can't do it,</v>

493
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.190
but she can't get cars.
You can't do it militarily.
That's the problem.

494
00:28:04.191 --> 00:28:08.380
Because it's like apocalypse now,
right.
And,
and they're like,
you know,

495
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.630
we went in and inoculated,
this is fiction by the way,
but we went in and knock,

496
00:28:11.631 --> 00:28:14.610
you dated the arms and then the,
the,
uh,
you know,
the,

497
00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.300
the Vietcong came in and cut the arms off and they're like,
you know,

498
00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:19.070
the curt's when he's going crazy,
he's saying,
you know,

499
00:28:19.071 --> 00:28:20.300
how are we going to win against that?

500
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.730
These are the kinds of things that we are capable of.

501
00:28:22.731 --> 00:28:24.530
These are the kinds of things that are happening today.

502
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.270
That's fiction that well it's,
I mean it's,
it's,
it's fiction within the movie,

503
00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:31.540
but you know when,
when it's,
it's,

504
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:33.470
the reason why I brought it up is I was actually,

505
00:28:33.471 --> 00:28:36.200
when I was interviewing the Taliban and they were telling me about that they

506
00:28:36.201 --> 00:28:38.330
were going to continue to use the child suicide bombers.

507
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.820
All I could think of was,
you know,
this,

508
00:28:41.821 --> 00:28:45.680
this quote from the movie of if they're going to cut off the arms of their own

509
00:28:45.681 --> 00:28:50.120
children because they were inoculated by an Americans,
then you know,

510
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.260
how can we win against that?

511
00:28:51.261 --> 00:28:53.990
And I was thinking if they're going to send their own kids to be suicide bombers

512
00:28:53.991 --> 00:28:54.920
and how are we going to win against,

513
00:28:54.921 --> 00:28:59.921
then you definitely can't do it militarily because then it's just,

514
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.620
it's one upmanship who can be worse,

515
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.320
who can fuck the other guy up the most and you know about this and in,

516
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.520
in any kind of street fight.
Okay,

517
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.260
well you're beating me with fists and I'll use a bottle.

518
00:29:12.261 --> 00:29:15.350
You're using a bottle is a knife.
When you're using a knife,
I'll use a gun.

519
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:20.000
<v 1>Well.
That's why I always tell people like avoid conflict at all costs.</v>

520
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:22.880
Always cause first of all,
so I'm going to want to be mad at anybody.

521
00:29:22.881 --> 00:29:25.250
It's going to be crazier than UTS.
And we'll not only that,

522
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.610
nobody likes it when you kicked their ass.
It's not like they forget that.
No,

523
00:29:28.611 --> 00:29:31.460
they make you their sworn enemy and they want to come back and get you right.

524
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:35.990
And a lot of times those situations where you make an enemy for life could have

525
00:29:35.991 --> 00:29:40.550
been avoided if you went out of your way to be whatever,

526
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:44.470
more apologetic,
friendlier,
nicer,
understand his point of view and that.

527
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.750
And then he probably would concede a little bit too,

528
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:49.690
and then maybe get a drink and then maybe it could be friends.

529
00:29:49.691 --> 00:29:53.140
I mean there's a lot of moments like that in life where it could go one way.

530
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:56.050
When you get in a fist fight with someone who that was totally avoidable,

531
00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.010
but maybe you were in a shit mood because your girlfriend just dumped you.

532
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:03.520
Or maybe,
you know,
he said something that he wished he didn't say,

533
00:30:03.521 --> 00:30:07.570
but he's fucking 22 and you say stupid shit.
You don't even really mean it.

534
00:30:07.571 --> 00:30:08.740
You don't even know what the fuck you're doing.

535
00:30:08.741 --> 00:30:12.520
You're just making noise with your mouth and practicing being a person,
you know.

536
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.380
And next thing you know you've got an enemy for life.

537
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.620
<v 3>Yeah.
The other thing is is is you know,</v>

538
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:21.300
it's a game where psychopaths when and that you know,
hey,

539
00:30:21.330 --> 00:30:24.220
is to be a psychopath situation because you know,

540
00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.390
you see guys who are going out there and you know you're going to have a fist

541
00:30:27.391 --> 00:30:29.810
fight in the back alley.
And so,
and then I,
you know,

542
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:33.150
and I was in a place one time where there was a fist fight and the guy sucked

543
00:30:33.151 --> 00:30:37.320
out a guy's eyeball,
but then this tore it out with his team because he's,

544
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.600
because he's a psychopath and you sit there and go,
well,

545
00:30:39.601 --> 00:30:42.780
there's always going to be somebody willing to take it to the next level and

546
00:30:42.781 --> 00:30:47.700
they'll take it.
It was in a place where I was,
I saw the aftermath of it though.

547
00:30:47.701 --> 00:30:51.810
It's been around.
And actually it's a,
it's a,
it's a famous,
uh,

548
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.510
what they call firms in the UK,
uh,
uh,
you know,

549
00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.480
football hooligans.
It was a hooligan move where they,
they,
they apparently,

550
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.500
and they suck your habit.
It's actually,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a move that they,

551
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:08.580
that they use it in a football match in the fighting of the firms.

552
00:31:08.581 --> 00:31:11.820
So like if you're at Manchester United versus Manchester City and they hate each

553
00:31:11.821 --> 00:31:12.720
other,
they have these fights,

554
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.190
<v 1>Jesus fucking Christ how nutty we man.</v>

555
00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:18.580
That people in England can't even get along with people in England.
Well,
that's,

556
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:19.780
that's the whole thing.

557
00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:22.760
<v 3>And you're like,
that's,
it goes back to the village mentality too,
which is,</v>

558
00:31:22.761 --> 00:31:24.530
I'm from this village.
I hate the guy from that.

559
00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:28.820
There's some tough mother fuckers from the UK or some type of mother fuckers

560
00:31:28.821 --> 00:31:30.920
anywhere.
Yeah.
And there's all over the world.
Right.

561
00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.570
<v 1>But there's like a certain,
like there's a London toughness,
you know,</v>

562
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:36.310
there's a whole UK toughness

563
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.880
<v 3>I come from,
I always say the tougher,</v>

564
00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.890
like the actually the poorer the neighborhood,

565
00:31:40.891 --> 00:31:44.610
the tougher the fighter often because they're fighting for fucking survey.

566
00:31:44.611 --> 00:31:48.870
I remember Barry Mcguire Gun,
I remember fucking Roberto Duran.
Fuck yeah,

567
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.470
Roberto Duran because he wasn't as good.
He wasn't as sugar ray Leonard.

568
00:31:52.471 --> 00:31:55.380
He was not as good of a fighter.
He was not as fast.
He just didn't have the time.

569
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.530
But he had the heart and he wanted to win it and he beat him and you know,

570
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.820
and they went back and forth.

571
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.620
<v 1>Well,
he fucked up in the second fight,
you know,</v>

572
00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.610
he went from the first fight that,

573
00:32:04.611 --> 00:32:09.611
that Duran was an animal that was a street animal and his boxing was,

574
00:32:09.991 --> 00:32:12.630
it was underrated.
He just had it very unconventional style.

575
00:32:12.631 --> 00:32:14.250
Like he would Paul with the left.

576
00:32:14.251 --> 00:32:16.560
He didn't have a stiff left jab the way Leonard did,

577
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.880
like Lennar would stick you Duran would Paul with the jab to more of a range

578
00:32:20.881 --> 00:32:24.720
finder.
But he was very clever man.
And by time,
by then he had already fought,

579
00:32:24.721 --> 00:32:28.470
can be Canon.
You ever watch that fight?
Jimmy's the original Andrew Gelada.

580
00:32:28.471 --> 00:32:32.400
He fucked up.
Can Be candid with low blows.
He blasted him right in the Dick.

581
00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.860
Like Duran was an animal man.
There was a,
um,

582
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:40.340
a story where they had went to a Panama wants to him about something,

583
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:42.570
<v 6>right?
It was like for like sports sales traders,
sub shit.
Right.</v>

584
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:44.360
And while these people were talking to him,

585
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:48.980
he picked up a cat by the tail and threw it against a wall and smashed it's

586
00:32:48.981 --> 00:32:53.390
head.
And they were like,
Whoa,
what the fuck?

587
00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:57.590
That's very like he was just so,
he was savage.
I mean,

588
00:32:57.591 --> 00:33:00.250
he literally was a wild man.
I mean,

589
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:05.090
became eventually a brilliant boxer as he developed as a man.

590
00:33:05.091 --> 00:33:07.700
And after he went through the no moss situation,
you know,

591
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:11.270
for people to know you don't fall boxing,
he quit in the second fight.

592
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:15.290
He beat Leonard in a really tough fight in the first five.
Very close fight.

593
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:19.900
Really wild,
amazing fight.
Even to this day,
the standard of that fight is very,

594
00:33:19.901 --> 00:33:23.210
very high.
Like you could picture the Duran of that error,

595
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:27.350
fighting like Floyd Mayweather and having an amazing fight.
There's,

596
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:30.800
it's not like looking at old football players or old mixed martial artists.

597
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:35.240
It was like really hotly contested.
Yeah.
Real high level stuff.

598
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.720
And then the second fight,
Duran got fat.

599
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.010
He had a hard time making the way he apparently looks,

600
00:33:42.011 --> 00:33:45.530
struggled to make the weight and they ate like a big stake and a gallon of

601
00:33:45.531 --> 00:33:48.920
orange juice and got really sick and yeah.

602
00:33:48.921 --> 00:33:52.670
And then there's also speculation that he was told to throw the fight that the

603
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:56.600
people at bed on it,
but he looked terrible.
He just didn't look.
And then he quit.

604
00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:00.890
And then after he quit,
man fucking Latinos,
the,
the,
the,

605
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:04.520
all the people that supported him,
all the Spanish speaking world.

606
00:34:04.521 --> 00:34:07.790
We're so upset because he was this macho,

607
00:34:07.791 --> 00:34:12.140
fucking savage representative of everything.
I mean,
just quit for no reason.

608
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:15.850
It's like no mosque,
no mosque.
Like nothing.
He's fine.
It was like,

609
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.960
do you know how much we fucking paid to watch this?

610
00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:23.150
So he was crushed for years and years and it was sad.
I watched him fight like,

611
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:23.481
you know,

612
00:34:23.481 --> 00:34:27.290
it's like all the sudden he just looked like this doughy version of who we used

613
00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:30.020
to be and then he came back and fought Davey Moore.

614
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:34.460
And if you remember that fight that he was,
uh,
he was a distinct underdog.

615
00:34:34.461 --> 00:34:36.050
Cause even as a WHO's in his late thirties,

616
00:34:36.051 --> 00:34:40.910
I think he was like 36 and in those day,
back in that day,
it was like,

617
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.370
that was really fucking old,
like 36.

618
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:45.500
Like Bernard Hopkins just want the tile at 48,

619
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.280
but for in Durand's Day 36 was old as fuck.

620
00:34:49.281 --> 00:34:52.850
But he box the shit out of Davey Moore.
Any thumbed them in the eye.

621
00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:56.660
More importantly,
he swole up one of his eyes and he couldn't see.

622
00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.493
And the kid just didn't,

623
00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.860
he never overcome adversity that where it was in with a guy,

624
00:35:00.861 --> 00:35:01.880
he really couldn't hurt.

625
00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.270
The guy was just clever enough to get out of the way of all his shit and land a

626
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:07.040
little bit and a little bit more and a little bit more.

627
00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:09.590
And as the rounds progressed he realized,
Oh my God,
I'm getting beat up.

628
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.030
Like it's just like this slow like beat down that he put on them.
That was a,

629
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:18.560
that was,
it was such a wild thing to see.
I love a guy and it comes back.

630
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:22.100
I love that guy.
That's like his life's in the toilet and then he bounces back.

631
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.310
George Foreman George Foreman is a fascinating story.

632
00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:27.230
I remember when he made his comeback,

633
00:35:27.231 --> 00:35:32.180
he's 36 years old and he was over 330 pounds or something crazy like that.

634
00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:36.050
Like it wrote Tunde,
it was a joke.
I love this fighting style,

635
00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:37.910
which is sort of like a weeble wobble,

636
00:35:37.911 --> 00:35:41.760
but we don't fall down and just sorta rock back and forth and he'd keep his left

637
00:35:41.761 --> 00:35:45.930
way out there like this because this was what was coming.
All of it was coming.

638
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:51.090
He could knock you out with anything.
Yeah,
he had like Hams for FIS.
That guy,

639
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:55.890
he was an incredible specimen but he went into four years of like heavy

640
00:35:55.891 --> 00:35:58.050
depression.
The Ali fight.
Yeah.

641
00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.640
It was a brutal fight for him cause he was a,
first of all,
I've never been,

642
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:06.540
he'd never encountered that kind of psychological warfare.
You know,

643
00:36:06.541 --> 00:36:11.541
when Ali was like dancing and screaming to the cameras and do you ever see,

644
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:15.900
you've seen the documentary on that when we were kings,
amazing,

645
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:20.430
amazing documentary.
And if Ali had retired after that fight,

646
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:24.110
oh man,
maybe it's silly around to talk about shit today.
You know,

647
00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.010
maybe we could have him on the podcast.
You know what I mean?
I mean,
he,

648
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:31.330
he hadn't really gotten to the point where he is a,

649
00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:33.180
his illness kicked in like it does now.

650
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:36.060
It's so sad to watch like his later fights.

651
00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:40.380
<v 3>Well taking,
taking the beating that,
uh,
you know,
foreman,
you know,</v>

652
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:44.970
actually in the documentary when they say,
you know,
he was taunting him,

653
00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:49.380
he was taunting him and finally form and just let them have it.
And they said,

654
00:36:49.381 --> 00:36:52.200
and then you saw the fear in Aliza eyes.
Then you saw a holy shit,

655
00:36:52.201 --> 00:36:56.370
what have I done here?
But then he lasted it through and then boom,
came back.

656
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.920
<v 6>That was just a,
we'll battle a battle of never rope a dope style.</v>

657
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:05.700
Nobody saw that coming against a guy like foreman and you see him like hitting

658
00:37:05.701 --> 00:37:07.890
that heavy bag,
just putting a hole in it and you're like,

659
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.870
you're taking that to the ribs to the kidneys.

660
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.110
There's a guy named Lavar Johnson and fights in the UFC right now who's

661
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:16.800
freakishly strong like that.
Like he's got that ridiculous kind of power.

662
00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:19.930
It's a huge guy.
He's about 250 pounds to lose,

663
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.220
I think it was two 60 for his last fight and he fought Brendan shop.

664
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:24.980
We just kept taking them down.
Brendan photo,

665
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:27.840
real smart fight cause he's just too dangerous standing up.

666
00:37:27.841 --> 00:37:32.100
He just knocks out everybody and he's so fucking powerful.

667
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:35.310
I mean he's not the most technical guy in the sport,

668
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:39.570
but for sure he's one of the hardest punches and hits you.
You're fucked.

669
00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.680
And everybody's just scrambling to grab a hold of this guy and drag him to the

670
00:37:43.681 --> 00:37:45.140
ground as quickly as possible.
Yeah,

671
00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:49.950
he's just got that thing and there's a few guys like a George Foreman type guys.

672
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.480
They just have that thing like they can hit you way harder than you can with

673
00:37:53.481 --> 00:37:56.790
them.
Everyone would watch for is right cause it would knock,
kill it.

674
00:37:56.791 --> 00:37:58.170
And then he was knocking you out with his left.

675
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:01.980
Tyson had speed that just was unrivaled,

676
00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.700
the ferocity and speed and the,

677
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:08.780
the ruthlessness other like if you watch the marvel Frazier fight

678
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.080
<v 3>immune in his prime when he was still up in Vermont.
And you know,</v>

679
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:18.740
<v 6>Brian,
pull up the Marvis Frazier fight.
Pull up Mike Tyson versus Marvis Frasier.</v>

680
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.030
Cause in my opinion,

681
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:24.680
this was the scariest I've ever seen a human being be in my life.

682
00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:28.550
I remember I was like,
I think I was probably like 18 or something.

683
00:38:28.551 --> 00:38:33.551
I was watching this at home on TV and Tyson just destroyed Marvis Fraser and the

684
00:38:33.681 --> 00:38:37.620
most violent fight I had ever seen it a box of Mac and I,

685
00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:39.430
and I thought to myself back then,
I was like,

686
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:43.870
if there's one person that would be the most terrifying person to be encountered

687
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:46.450
with,
it would be Mike Tyson.
I like,
dude,
that eds at separate lives,

688
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.370
watch this fight.
I mean,
he just,

689
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.960
Marvis Frazier was like a top heavyweight contender and Tyson just step to them

690
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.820
and just started fucking bull blasting him,
dodging under punches,

691
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:01.870
got him in this corner right here.
And this is the end right here.
What?
Bang,

692
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.520
Bang,
Bang,
Bang,
Bang,
Bang.
That's all before he can fall down.

693
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.200
He's already unconscious.

694
00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:13.090
Tyson hits him four times more before he even gets to the ground.
It was,

695
00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.800
it was like an assassination.

696
00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:18.250
<v 3>Yeah.
When I was watching Tyson,
I was like,
no one's ever going to beat.</v>

697
00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.570
Not For 10 he ended up beating himself.

698
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.250
<v 6>Well,
you know what it is,
man.
It's,
it's a bunch of things.
First of all,</v>

699
00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:27.010
that that once you've gotten there,

700
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.040
it's gotta be a very strange and uncharted place in your mind and in your,

701
00:39:32.401 --> 00:39:35.800
your ability to maintain discipline and living in this also.

702
00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:37.490
So 20 something years old,

703
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.820
<v 3>live,
you know,
he'd been trained,</v>

704
00:39:39.821 --> 00:39:42.450
he'd been taken out of Brownsville who'd been taken out of reform school.

705
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:46.150
He'd been trained by one of the greatest trainers of all time,
you know,

706
00:39:46.151 --> 00:39:47.980
adopted effectively by it.

707
00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:49.000
<v 6>And more importantly,</v>

708
00:39:49.001 --> 00:39:52.750
custom motto was one of the greatest psychological trainers of all time.

709
00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.070
And he saw in him,

710
00:39:54.071 --> 00:39:59.071
he said he's the greatest raw talent and he would custom motto would say things

711
00:39:59.171 --> 00:40:02.920
that to this day there's a,
you can have a short,

712
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:08.190
precise point that an athlete can digest and take with him as he steps out of

713
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:13.630
the locker room and into the ring that actually can help.
And custom motto said,

714
00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:17.500
one of the most brilliant things I've ever heard when it comes to being

715
00:40:17.501 --> 00:40:21.070
terrified in the face of combat and in the face of a fight.

716
00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:26.340
And he said that every man experiences fire and that fire can cook your food,

717
00:40:26.621 --> 00:40:29.920
it can heat your house or if you let it get away,

718
00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:34.420
it can burn you to the ground and you have to decide how to take care of it.

719
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:38.050
But the coward and the hero feel the exact same thing.

720
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.760
It's just the coward falls into the pressure where the hero figures out how to

721
00:40:42.761 --> 00:40:46.360
manage it and overcome it and actually rises to the occasion and keeps it

722
00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:50.080
together.
Right.
So for custom model,
like he had studied,

723
00:40:50.081 --> 00:40:55.081
like he had studied psychology and he had studied so many aspects that are,

724
00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.650
are crucial to success in that crazy isolated type of a sport where you can kind

725
00:41:03.031 --> 00:41:05.650
of like Tyson,
who says needy young,

726
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.380
energetic physical specimen,

727
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:12.640
just just filled with anger and rage and not getting enough love.

728
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:17.750
And all of a sudden this Yoda motherfucker comes out of the Catskills and yeah,

729
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.800
it's one of the greatest sports stories in sports history.

730
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:25.270
It's sad the way it ended and let me know it isn't Stad mad.
It's not sad.

731
00:41:25.271 --> 00:41:26.770
He's alive,
he's fine.

732
00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:31.950
Tyson's doing these story shows with Dana White told me it's fucking fantastic.

733
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.000
He goes on and he tells these wild stories about his life and spike Lee directed

734
00:41:38.001 --> 00:41:42.230
it.
It's apparently amazing.
So it's not sad.
It's inevitable.

735
00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:46.430
There's no way you can keep beating people up and that's happy because it's

736
00:41:46.431 --> 00:41:50.000
always sad for the people you beat up.
I mean,
there is no happy ending.

737
00:41:50.001 --> 00:41:52.130
If you beat the fuck out of people for the rest of your life,

738
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.040
there's no happy ending.
There's a bunch of sad endings.

739
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:59.850
There's your happy ending.
You're happy.
You get to retire undefeated.
Yay.
Uh,

740
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.870
no,
I had never had to take it,
dish it all out tonight.

741
00:42:02.871 --> 00:42:05.900
Everybody like rocky Marciano and everybody was,

742
00:42:05.901 --> 00:42:09.520
there's the big deal that rocky Marciano reached whatever it was,
46 and eight,

743
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:14.240
over 39.
And everybody was like,
Masha was the only one that retire undefeated.

744
00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:17.870
Well that's almost unfair.
It's almost unfair.
You know,

745
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:19.700
I was looking to retire in the feet.

746
00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:25.510
<v 5>My parasite,
I think.
Yeah,
you lost that game.</v>

747
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:29.020
You had to cheat,
you had to hit performance enhancing drugs.

748
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.740
Your immune system wasn't able to fight off the alien.
You had to swallow poison.

749
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.560
<v 3>I don't know man.
I'm just talking shit.</v>

750
00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.260
What was it like hunting in Japan or you weren't you a hunting animal?

751
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.490
<v 5>No,
no,
no.
You're confusing it.
Siberia.</v>

752
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.250
Chernobyl about that last thing.
You,
yeah.

753
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.750
Though the wolves like they're freakish giant wolves out there.

754
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:56.280
<v 3>Yeah.
Well they're,
they're mutated.
Mutated.</v>

755
00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:00.910
Is that true?
For Real?
I'll never say 100% what they look like.
Well,

756
00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.640
the mutations are mostly internal,
um,
because their,
their,
uh,

757
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:10.870
the,
the exclusion zone,
which is a huge area is a radioactive.

758
00:43:10.871 --> 00:43:13.270
And so they've gone,
they've undergone mutations.

759
00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:15.160
I actually read something the other day saying,

760
00:43:15.161 --> 00:43:19.720
I'm from Ukraine and there's all these horses out there and,
and you know,

761
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:24.460
there aren't mutations.
We actually have the guys,
the,
the,
the,

762
00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:27.910
the,
uh,
the,
the people who run the exclusion zone,

763
00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:32.380
admitting on camera.
Yes,
they're mutated.
The scientists are saying the mutated.

764
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.610
And of course they're mutated because they're growing up in a,
in a,

765
00:43:35.611 --> 00:43:40.510
in a radioactive zone about the size of France.
And,
uh,

766
00:43:40.570 --> 00:43:44.930
but yeah,
we went to,
to hunt them.
The thing is,
is we had an,
a,
um,

767
00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.670
a Geiger counter with us.
And whenever they,
they sort of,

768
00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.000
you go off and they go into the forest,
the forest,
which is where all the,

769
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:55.360
you know,
the dirt and everything is trapped.
They would go,

770
00:43:55.361 --> 00:43:59.770
it would go off the register.
I mean,
it was like,
you know,
I forget what it was,

771
00:43:59.771 --> 00:44:04.680
but it was like 400 mega rems or whatever it was,
was,
was uh,
uh,

772
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:09.160
safe and we got to 14,000 at one point.
And you're like,
you know,
speaking of,

773
00:44:09.161 --> 00:44:13.900
speaking of parasites a,
you know,
I,
I,
I,
you know,
parasites I'll take,
but,

774
00:44:13.901 --> 00:44:17.770
uh,
you know,
1400 times the healthy,
uh,

775
00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:22.520
<v 5>yeah.
But then you have some radiation Somby parasites now radioactive Ferris,</v>

776
00:44:22.521 --> 00:44:25.330
I seen the fish.
Have you seen the fish of Chernobyl,

777
00:44:25.331 --> 00:44:28.800
those videos of these enormous fish?
Brion pull that up.

778
00:44:28.801 --> 00:44:32.040
Cause it's really strange.
I mean,
I don't know,
maybe fish,
maybe I'm

779
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.160
<v 1>just ignorant and don't like sturgeons are,
so if you look at it now too,</v>

780
00:44:35.161 --> 00:44:36.870
if you look at what's happening in Japan,

781
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:41.871
they have massive protests in Japan saying you have to stop nuclear energy

782
00:44:42.301 --> 00:44:46.830
because look at what the fuck happened in,
in Fukushima,

783
00:44:46.831 --> 00:44:50.040
because you know,
we had a tsunami,
which we're going to have more and more of.

784
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:50.941
But guess what?

785
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:55.790
Now we have whole radioactive villages and ray radiation in the groundwater,

786
00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.690
radiation or radiation in the food.
What does that look?

787
00:45:00.691 --> 00:45:03.420
A giant carp?
Is that a fish Fukushima?
That's fucked up.

788
00:45:03.421 --> 00:45:05.540
That's just a giant carpe dude.
Uh,
I think that's,

789
00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:12.810
if you Google radioactive fish of Chernobyl,
there's a video where these,

790
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:16.410
um,
these people are by this river and these enormous fish.

791
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.170
I don't know what they are.
I mean,
maybe it's just,
that's what they are.

792
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:20.940
Maybe it's like there's a lot of fish there.

793
00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:25.920
And the people went there when we were there.
The people who run the actual zone,

794
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.630
we're saying that the animals,
uh,

795
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:33.480
they admitted the animals are mutated and so,
well,
of course they are.

796
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.920
I mean,
why wouldn't you?
You have,
you have massive amounts of radiation.

797
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:40.230
How can they not be?
We had this dude,

798
00:45:40.231 --> 00:45:43.730
Scott Sigler on the podcast yesterday and he's an author and he wrote,

799
00:45:43.770 --> 00:45:48.720
he writes about shit like that fucking island of mutated animals that are 650

800
00:45:48.721 --> 00:45:53.250
pounds and their pack predators with fins.
So you freaking me out right now,
man.

801
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:57.280
I freaking me out with these Siberian,
a werewolf stories.
Uh,

802
00:45:57.630 --> 00:46:00.270
that'd be an awesome movie though.
Siberian Werewolf.

803
00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:05.420
Cause the mutation that was like,
you know,
almost all of the like,
um,

804
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.100
like when you were a kid,
but,
well not all of them,

805
00:46:08.101 --> 00:46:12.240
but it was always a constant theme for superheroes.
Yeah.
You know,

806
00:46:12.241 --> 00:46:16.140
like David Banner became the hawk.
It was Bruce banner originally,

807
00:46:16.141 --> 00:46:18.630
but they thought that was too gay for television.
So they changed it to,

808
00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:24.540
it was always you came close to it,
but just close to the x men,
right?
Yeah.

809
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:28.920
They would all get like some super power as opposed to testicular cancer or if I

810
00:46:28.921 --> 00:46:33.420
can renal renal cancers,
the fantastic four.
Like they get to,

811
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.620
they got fucking the most to us or something happened and they became super

812
00:46:37.621 --> 00:46:38.454
powerful.

813
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.740
We're so usually we usually we're talking about politics.
We're like,
what the,

814
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:48.170
how the hell did the fantastic four
at Louise,

815
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:53.040
like the fantastic four man.
I always liked comic books out when I was a kid.

816
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:54.150
But in that,

817
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:59.150
that was such a big theme in that somehow or another you would get into some

818
00:46:59.521 --> 00:47:03.420
encounter with massive amounts of radiation,
but you would become a superhero.

819
00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:08.010
And so every kid sort of looked at that like,
wow,
yeah man.
As opposed to,

820
00:47:08.011 --> 00:47:08.490
you know,

821
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:13.270
what the reality of what it does to bunny's being born with no arms or legs.

822
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:16.320
Ooh,
that's weird shit man.
That shit.

823
00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:18.870
And you don't know like what,

824
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:21.430
how's this all going to balance out and how long is it going to take?

825
00:47:21.431 --> 00:47:21.901
Cause by the way,

826
00:47:21.901 --> 00:47:26.901
life can sort of barely trudge on and incredibly fucked up state of toxicity for

827
00:47:27.421 --> 00:47:29.620
several thousand years.
And you know,

828
00:47:29.621 --> 00:47:33.280
eventually get to the point where either figures out how to clean everything up

829
00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:37.690
or mutates to the point where he can tolerate it,
but it's not going to be fun,

830
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.410
you know?
No,
it's not going to,
it's a voidable too.
Well,
when we,

831
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.760
<v 3>we interviewed the a four are a world's most dangerous border piece,</v>

832
00:47:46.761 --> 00:47:49.130
which I think we've talked about here.
India,
Pakistan and Kashmir,

833
00:47:49.131 --> 00:47:53.000
which actually the fort that we were based out of just got attacked yesterday.

834
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:55.820
Um,
they said,
uh,

835
00:47:55.910 --> 00:48:00.910
categorically that if you use more than 100 warheads of which they have hundreds

836
00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:04.400
of warheads pointing at each other in new banks,
then um,

837
00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:08.840
that the world as we know,
it ceases to exist.
Everything is just,
I mean,

838
00:48:08.841 --> 00:48:12.290
the ozone is gone and it's,
it's like,
you know,

839
00:48:12.291 --> 00:48:14.720
the planet of the apes students who were living underground,

840
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:18.020
that's the type of shit that you're,
you're,
you know,
and you sit there and say,

841
00:48:18.021 --> 00:48:19.580
this is what's happening today.

842
00:48:19.581 --> 00:48:23.780
Is that Indian Pakistan hating each other mean that,
you know,

843
00:48:23.781 --> 00:48:28.781
we have the distinct possibility that our ozone has gone or the one of these

844
00:48:28.791 --> 00:48:31.430
crazy fox posts pushes the button.
Exactly.

845
00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.980
Well then we'd have to hope that the aliens land and stop all that shit.

846
00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:37.340
It's the only thing that can save us

847
00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.760
<v 1>alien aliens were real.
That would be the time to move,</v>

848
00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:46.170
to get in between India and Pakistan and go,
guys,
guys,
guys,

849
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:50.970
God damn,
what is this mess you've got here?
Why is there a billion people here?

850
00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:52.950
Everybody settle the fuck down.

851
00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.480
You look exactly the same when you hate each other.
That's nonsense.
In your,

852
00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:59.130
you're right across it.
Some stupid divide.

853
00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.990
One person believes in one pile of wacky bullshit and the other person,

854
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.310
everybody settle the fuck down.
All right.

855
00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:08.160
You need a big spaceship to pull that off though.

856
00:49:08.161 --> 00:49:12.180
Like several football fields long and you need to do a magic trick or two and

857
00:49:12.181 --> 00:49:14.880
let these bitches know that you're there for,
for serious,

858
00:49:14.881 --> 00:49:17.340
you're not taking any bullshit.
Makes them trees disappear.

859
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:21.030
<v 3>You're out here in La and Atlanta,
Scientology,
you know,
you get everyone's,</v>

860
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.140
you've got to get the aliens,
doctors,
Arc and the feet tons and all that.

861
00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:26.100
<v 1>Hmm.
Amazing.
Amazing.</v>

862
00:49:26.101 --> 00:49:29.250
How easy that was to pull off when you really read that story.
Sure.

863
00:49:29.310 --> 00:49:30.540
Make it doesn't make you want to start a call.

864
00:49:30.541 --> 00:49:33.000
Just a little baby when it's pretty interesting.

865
00:49:33.001 --> 00:49:35.820
I got to say I'm fascinated by it.
It's amazing.

866
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:40.800
If you could live in the 1950s and like start your call throwing the same time

867
00:49:40.801 --> 00:49:41.750
he started his call,

868
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.150
<v 3>dark coats to Warren Jeffs,
you know is doing it right now.</v>

869
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:49.990
Warren Jeffs a Utah though.
It's totally different animal.

870
00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.480
Utah's a different animal.
You can pull it off there.

871
00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:56.500
We did get any new Mexicans to buy into that bullshit.
We did.
Uh,

872
00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.490
we did it where they buy into it all it was,
but we did a story on the lost boys.

873
00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:05.950
These guys,
the lost boys.
Uh,
so because of,
uh,
um,

874
00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:10.710
uh,
you know,
well,
[inaudible] more in Jeff's case,
pronounced with it.

875
00:50:10.711 --> 00:50:12.280
He has like 78 wives,
but

876
00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.300
<v 1>Sam,
why you hating pitch</v>

877
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:20.300
<v 3>the elders get like,
you know,
20,
30,
40 wives,
but then by just by math,</v>

878
00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:25.130
okay.
There's only x amount of women,
so they have to get rid of these,
the kids.

879
00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:29.390
<v 1>Okay.
You're not thinking terms of being bountiful.
I thank you.</v>

880
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:33.860
Bringing in more women.
See,
you're seeing a problem.
I see,
uh,
an uh,

881
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:38.870
an equation that you have to solve and bring me,

882
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:39.943
bring in more crazy

883
00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:43.710
<v 3>what's happening is there,
they kicked the kid,
the,
the men,
the boys out.</v>

884
00:50:44.070 --> 00:50:47.910
And so these kids who grew up in this religion that says everybody else's evil

885
00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:50.330
and you can't do anything and they don't know how to pay bills or nothing,

886
00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:51.610
they just kicked him out and said,
okay,

887
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:54.060
you're gone now because they want the girls.
They have that right.

888
00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:58.610
<v 1>Okay,
that's weak.
That's that's you're not,
you're not loving your,</v>

889
00:50:58.611 --> 00:51:02.930
your brothers and sisters there new crazy.
You're kicking out your own kids.

890
00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:07.940
You're also kicking out people who know how crazy your nutty cult is and they're

891
00:51:07.941 --> 00:51:11.420
going to eventually tell people why and why they're so sad.
Why so sad,
Billy?

892
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.440
<v 7>Oh My fucking dad.
And he's fucking bitches to marry,</v>

893
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.540
so he kicked me out.

894
00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:21.830
So I can't have girlfriends who's poor girls who grew up with no men and they're

895
00:51:21.831 --> 00:51:24.440
forced to accept the fact the 70 year old guy,

896
00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:28.450
<v 1>I liked the voice that you're adopting is me.
That's me in therapy.
If I,</v>

897
00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:31.390
if I got kicked out by my dad and he was fucking his girl,

898
00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:35.980
I was in love with my own dad's like shutoffs on,
get out of the room.
She's mine.

899
00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:42.180
Mine.
I need a hundred of them a hundred.
But you know what?
And the other hand,

900
00:51:42.181 --> 00:51:45.390
you can't hate if the guy can keep it up.
Wow.

901
00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.990
<v 3>I don't know.
Uh,
I don't know if he could keep it up in prison.</v>

902
00:51:49.070 --> 00:51:52.370
<v 1>Don't take that out of context,
ladies and gentlemen.
I don't really mean that.</v>

903
00:51:52.371 --> 00:51:53.980
I was only in jest.

904
00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:58.700
I think that that guy obviously victimized some poor people that were easily
led.

905
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.180
My always,
my question has always been why are people still so easily led?

906
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:03.350
That's a good question.

907
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.540
Is it just a way the body is designed that some of us are worker bees and some

908
00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:09.740
of us are,
you know,

909
00:52:09.741 --> 00:52:14.660
a middle management and some of us are the contrarians hanging on the outside

910
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:17.040
like you were I life is hard.
Well yeah,
what it is

911
00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:22.580
<v 3>and you're looking for someone to say,
here's why it's hard.
Here's why it's hard.</v>

912
00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:25.280
And by the way,
if you work hard and do what I say,

913
00:52:25.281 --> 00:52:28.430
then you're going to go to some place better because now it's a bitch.

914
00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.980
Now it's fucking hard as shit.
But if you do,

915
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:32.390
all this shit is going to get better.

916
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:37.120
<v 1>No.
What else that is,
it's like being in a group is great.</v>

917
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:40.400
It's nice to be in a group.
It's us against them.
Yeah.

918
00:52:40.401 --> 00:52:44.320
I like what we call death squad.
Like,
uh,
it's not like,

919
00:52:44.321 --> 00:52:47.350
it's not like you don't have to join it or anything like that.
It's not real.

920
00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:51.310
So for nation,
yeah,
the Tattoo,
is it your right cheek?

921
00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.830
Um,
but got the whole,

922
00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:57.790
but it's cool like when we go places and we see all those death squad shirts,

923
00:52:57.791 --> 00:53:01.030
like it's,
it's insane.
There's something cool about it.

924
00:53:01.031 --> 00:53:03.310
There's something like undeniably cool about it.

925
00:53:03.311 --> 00:53:06.130
Like we're not trying to really start a call and I tell anybody what to do,

926
00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:08.980
but if we show up somewhere and you were at a desk quad chart,

927
00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:13.090
it's kind of bad ass.
And I was like,
what's up man?
How you doing?
Like,
you know,

928
00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:16.660
most likely,
unless he's an undercover cop,
that's going to be a very nice guy.

929
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.950
You know what I mean with this podcast is for now I'm finally getting your like

930
00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:24.310
selling Macy's steal mail,
starting a call.
It would be cool.
No,

931
00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.400
it's desk as well.
You don't want a real cult.
See that.
The,

932
00:53:27.401 --> 00:53:31.320
the best kind of cult is the kind of culture that doesn't really have any

933
00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:35.430
foundation whatsoever.
No leadership,
there's no structure.

934
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:37.410
And everybody kind of knows what the fuck to do.

935
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.050
That's the perfect cult where you can't really like,

936
00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.860
say you're doing anything you've said up to not use it up.
The Metta,

937
00:53:43.890 --> 00:53:48.360
the medical podcast.
That's what you start podcasts,

938
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:48.960
podcasts,

939
00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:52.680
and you eventually you get into their system and once you get into their system,

940
00:53:52.681 --> 00:53:54.030
he tell him,
listen man,

941
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.060
we just need to spread this and we're all going to be okay.

942
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:02.010
We just need to get this out to everybody.
Spread it out as far and wide.

943
00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.070
And it's real simple.
It's like Jim Jeffrey said about the Bible.

944
00:54:05.071 --> 00:54:08.910
Do you ever see Jim Jefferies bit about the Bible?
It should say,
don't be a cunt,

945
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:14.630
you know,
and it really Upn you getting up to pee more alcohol deal.

946
00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:18.700
Uh,
Jamie wants you or yeah,
one of you gentlemen that's not working.

947
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.690
You sure you don't want the Koolaid Shane?

948
00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:26.691
Our koolade is when we processed in a special micro filter that's pumped up hill

949
00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:31.440
using Onnit.
Yeah.
Using gravel and stream water and uh,

950
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.800
and it's all broadcast live on audible.com

951
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:41.730
but um,
thank you sir.
Thank you very much.
I think,

952
00:54:41.731 --> 00:54:42.170
uh,

953
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:47.170
I I really do think all bullshit aside that your shit that you guys are doing on

954
00:54:48.690 --> 00:54:53.690
vice.com it's amaze has as much of an impact on where this culture is going and

955
00:54:56.161 --> 00:55:01.161
the potential that this culture has for understanding the true inner workings of

956
00:55:01.981 --> 00:55:06.981
all the various aspects of intergovernmental relationships and nutty places like

957
00:55:07.981 --> 00:55:10.830
Chernobyl and the Liberia episode.

958
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:15.420
I didn't know anything about Liberia until I watched that show and you guys have

959
00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:20.010
done more look just for educating me.
Okay.
And I,
and I can like,

960
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.720
I mean not really educate people,

961
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:26.700
but tell you like what link to click on that kind of a connection.
I've,

962
00:55:26.910 --> 00:55:31.910
you guys have exposed me to some of the most little understood little talked

963
00:55:34.621 --> 00:55:39.570
about things that are so bizarre and hard to believe that exists today.

964
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.890
<v 3>Well,
I,
I know,
I think I said this last time,</v>

965
00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:46.870
your audience is maybe the best audience in the,
in the goddamn world because we,

966
00:55:46.871 --> 00:55:47.680
you know,

967
00:55:47.680 --> 00:55:51.430
people used to say vice was the best content on the web that you've never seen.

968
00:55:51.850 --> 00:55:54.400
And when we started to come out here and do this podcast,

969
00:55:54.401 --> 00:55:59.140
all of a sudden we didn't get these,
you know,
fanatical sort of positivist.
Wow.

970
00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:02.860
Like great responses.
And it was always with the Hashtag,
you know,

971
00:56:02.861 --> 00:56:07.420
powerful or Oregon or whatever.
And it's always by,
oh,
100% of the time it's your,

972
00:56:07.421 --> 00:56:10.420
it's,
you know,
and I've got to say that says a lot about you,

973
00:56:10.421 --> 00:56:13.330
but it also says a lot about,
you know,
the people that listen to this podcast,

974
00:56:13.331 --> 00:56:16.570
which is,
you know,
they're,
they're thinking for themselves.
You know,

975
00:56:16.690 --> 00:56:18.890
they're there,
they're listening to alternative shit.

976
00:56:18.891 --> 00:56:21.270
They're not believe in the bullshit that they see on,
on,

977
00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.270
on regular mainstream TV.
And look,
they're there.

978
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.080
They're positive when someone says,
look,

979
00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:29.890
we're like you said we love you and I live on the periphery and we live on the

980
00:56:29.891 --> 00:56:33.250
periphery,
but we're trying to do our thing.
And you know what,
when,

981
00:56:33.310 --> 00:56:36.250
when people who listened to this podcast are so positive,

982
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.000
it makes me fucking happy.
And it makes me say,
and I don't mind,

983
00:56:40.001 --> 00:56:44.020
I got a helmet and fucking flesh eating fucking fucking golden because,

984
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:48.370
because these motherfuckers on Twitter and on Facebook and an advice there are

985
00:56:48.371 --> 00:56:51.310
so fucking positive.
And then I'm going to tell you another thing.

986
00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:55.360
It makes me feel like we can change it.
It makes me feel like,
okay,

987
00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:57.790
there is some negative motherfuckers out there in the world who were doing some

988
00:56:57.791 --> 00:57:02.260
really bad shit,
but we can actually do things to stop that.

989
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:04.270
And you're doing it and I'm doing it.
And then by the way,

990
00:57:04.271 --> 00:57:06.790
the people on this podcast are doing it and,
and,

991
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:10.390
and the more people that actually educate themselves and listen to you and come

992
00:57:10.391 --> 00:57:14.140
in here and check on those links,
that's fucking how we change it.

993
00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.080
We shouldn't expect anyone else to change your shift for you because they won't.

994
00:57:17.530 --> 00:57:20.860
<v 6>I agree with you.
And I also believe that it's,</v>

995
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:26.790
it's also a matter of projecting a certain way of living that you project,

996
00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:29.140
uh,
you,
you,

997
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:34.140
you project a very honest and a humbled view of the world.

998
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.680
And I think when someone is exposed to a guy like you,
um,
it,

999
00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:45.430
when a guy's sitting on his stationary bike right now,
riding along,

1000
00:57:45.431 --> 00:57:48.730
listening to this show and listening to you or your experiences in life and

1001
00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:53.220
Karachi in Liberia,
which I really want to get to again,
they,
they,

1002
00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:55.780
they sort of like get this view like,
okay,

1003
00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:59.290
there's this fucking guy who's out here doing all this crazy shit.

1004
00:57:59.291 --> 00:58:01.930
And he's saying all these things,
like,
this guy has no reason to lie to me.

1005
00:58:01.931 --> 00:58:05.440
This guy's,
he's,
he's not like anybody that I've ever met before,

1006
00:58:05.441 --> 00:58:08.860
but yet I'm sort of absorbing his thoughts.
And by doing that,
you're,

1007
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.160
you're injecting these ideas.

1008
00:58:11.161 --> 00:58:16.161
It might not have ever manifest themselves in hundreds of thousands and millions

1009
00:58:16.841 --> 00:58:21.200
of people.
And that's some powerful,
powerful,
powerful shit.
And it's,

1010
00:58:21.201 --> 00:58:24.610
it's not on CBS and it's not an NBC and it's never going to be,

1011
00:58:24.611 --> 00:58:29.380
it's never going to be broadcast by anybody that doesn't want to risk everything

1012
00:58:29.381 --> 00:58:30.080
they already have,

1013
00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:32.510
<v 3>which we get a lot of shit for.
You know,
we get,
we get,</v>

1014
00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:33.590
we get a lot of shit for it.

1015
00:58:33.591 --> 00:58:36.920
And this is another thing I want to say about the people on this podcast is a

1016
00:58:36.921 --> 00:58:41.300
lot of times,
you know,
for example,
what just went down in North Korea,
um,

1017
00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:45.540
you know,
we get attacked by mainstream media and yet,
you know,

1018
00:58:45.590 --> 00:58:48.290
people who are on the periphery,
people who are watching us,
people are there.

1019
00:58:48.291 --> 00:58:52.530
It's like,
exactly,
this is exactly what the fuck we want to have.
Go on.
Well,

1020
00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:55.360
<v 6>nobody expose mainstream.
Well,
no,</v>

1021
00:58:55.361 --> 00:58:58.410
be in the mainstream rather exposed North Korea the way that you guys did when

1022
00:58:58.411 --> 00:58:59.760
you went to North Korea and,

1023
00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:04.910
and showed those fake restaurants and showed just how spooky and nutty the

1024
00:59:06.031 --> 00:59:09.300
atmosphere was over there.
We were not,

1025
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:11.580
we knew there was no shells that were doing that.

1026
00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:13.920
There was no 60 minutes wasn't doing that.

1027
00:59:14.130 --> 00:59:19.130
The honesty in in which you portray things like from ladyboys and Thailand.

1028
00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.980
I mean,
you know what I mean?
When you were hanging with the

1029
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:24.350
<v 1>lady boys,
Dude,
I'm telling you man,</v>

1030
00:59:24.351 --> 00:59:28.250
I became a fan of yours when I saw that video of you hanging with the lady boys.

1031
00:59:28.251 --> 00:59:31.760
Huh?
You know why?
Here's why.
Because you were being kind to them.

1032
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:33.680
You are being nice today.
You were,

1033
00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:36.860
you were chilling out with them in a bathtub and all like laughing,

1034
00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:40.610
but it wasn't even,
you weren't being creepy and sexual,

1035
00:59:40.611 --> 00:59:43.370
you weren't being a douchebag.
You're being a sweetheart.

1036
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:46.100
You're being a nice person to a bunch of other nice people.
No,

1037
00:59:46.101 --> 00:59:50.780
no bullshit and it's hard to do that.
It's hard to do that.

1038
00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:53.390
It's hard to do that without loose fucking faggot.

1039
00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:56.390
It's hard to do that without someone to being mad at you.

1040
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:59.150
It's hard to do that without protecting your ego.

1041
00:59:59.151 --> 01:00:01.730
How are People gonna think about you?
You're hanging out with these ladyboys.

1042
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:06.470
Yeah.
You were just a guy who is there and he was trying to be nice to some other

1043
01:00:06.471 --> 01:00:09.740
people and they were being nice to you back and it was the right thing to do.

1044
01:00:09.741 --> 01:00:12.770
And it resonated.
And I remember watching that video going,

1045
01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:14.990
this guy's a cool motherfucker.
And I,

1046
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:19.080
I think that was before I even saw Heimos,
uh,

1047
01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.110
adventure Arctic adventure,

1048
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:25.850
which was the thing that really made me a vice addict,
you know,
I mean,

1049
01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:30.230
I check your eye.
I look@vice.com more than any other website on the net.

1050
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:34.040
Pretty much other than Twitter and checking my own email.

1051
01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.140
I watch all your shit.
I watched that heimos great adventure,

1052
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:40.460
whatever it was.
Arctic adventure.

1053
01:00:40.461 --> 01:00:42.980
What is the natural name of that was vice guide to travel?

1054
01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:47.680
<v 5>Yeah,
it was the most remote.
Um,
man on earth.
Hi Mo.</v>

1055
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.260
Hi Mo.
The remotest place on earth.
The remoteness of man on earth.

1056
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:53.690
<v 1>Well,
if you just Google Hind Mo and vice,</v>

1057
01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:58.200
you'll find out whatever the actual,
uh,
do you know what it is?
No,
it's just

1058
01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.180
<v 5>one of the lazy boys,
Lady Boys,
by the way.
I mean,
how dare you,</v>

1059
01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:05.150
everyone on the Internet,

1060
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.460
everyone always asks me that question and you're like,

1061
01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:12.760
you understand that there's like two camera guys and sound crew like we're

1062
01:01:13.011 --> 01:01:17.240
shooting,
we're shooting.
So what?
You did the right thing,
man.
It was beautiful.

1063
01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:22.010
I wish I would be that strong.
I'd be like,
get bitch,
get off me.
Don't touch me.

1064
01:01:22.450 --> 01:01:24.830
But you know how it is at a certain point in your life,

1065
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.170
you don't give a fuck what anybody thinks about you.

1066
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:29.930
You don't give up and you're just like,
you know what?
I'm going to do my shit.

1067
01:01:29.931 --> 01:01:33.050
I'm going to try to get through the day and do the best thing I possibly can and

1068
01:01:33.051 --> 01:01:34.680
that's it.
That's all I can do.
Or you know.

1069
01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:39.420
<v 1>Well,
I,
I think that's,
that's a possible state to achieve and maintain,</v>

1070
01:01:39.421 --> 01:01:40.860
but I think it's difficult to get there.

1071
01:01:40.861 --> 01:01:45.150
And for a lot of people that's an alien concept and that's why when I saw you or

1072
01:01:45.151 --> 01:01:49.140
so like comfortable and cool about that,
I was like,
you're,

1073
01:01:49.141 --> 01:01:51.610
there's no way that guy's not cool.
I was like,
that guy.

1074
01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.660
That's a cool motherfucker.
Like you were just like real easy with these people.

1075
01:01:54.661 --> 01:01:57.040
It was fun and I really,
I,
I,
I,

1076
01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:02.220
there was an issue that came up last week or earlier this week about transgender

1077
01:02:02.221 --> 01:02:03.210
MMA fighters.

1078
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.360
There's a woman who used to be a man who's now fighting and MMA against women

1079
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.890
and you know,
people have been,

1080
01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.850
I've gotten some heat about it on Twitter that I took the wrong stance because I

1081
01:02:14.851 --> 01:02:18.870
said that that's a guy that cut his dick off and he's fighting girls and that's

1082
01:02:18.871 --> 01:02:19.980
the of the story.
You can,

1083
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.590
<v 6>you can say all you want.
I don't care what the Olympic Committee says,</v>

1084
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:27.030
there's a different mechanical advantage to being a man.
No Way.

1085
01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:32.060
I want everyone to know that if you really feel like you are supposed to be a

1086
01:02:33.901 --> 01:02:37.590
woman and you're a man,
I am,
I will still be friends with you.

1087
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.350
Like I have zero issue with that.

1088
01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.560
My only issue in that venue is that I understand the mechanical advantage of the

1089
01:02:46.861 --> 01:02:50.220
male frame.
I just,
I just do.
If I lost,

1090
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:52.410
like if I lost my dick and balls,

1091
01:02:52.411 --> 01:02:54.810
if I decided to chop my dick and balls off and be a woman,

1092
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:58.860
I would still have these giant hands and they're not going to shrink.

1093
01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.940
These aren't going to go away.

1094
01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.920
So this is a mechanical advantage to having this big hammer fist to punch a girl

1095
01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:08.580
in the face with that's fucked up.
It's just,
it's not the same.

1096
01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.940
And anybody who says that it's the same as far as athletics and calm,

1097
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:16.380
it might be the same in track and field.
If you don't have balls anymore,

1098
01:03:16.381 --> 01:03:20.040
you might not be able to run as fast.
Ever seen a beautiful boxer?
Never seen it.

1099
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:22.230
That's the Thai boxer.
That was the,

1100
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:27.231
I'm a lady boy with testicles successful than chop them off and then started

1101
01:03:27.751 --> 01:03:32.370
getting his ass kicked.
I believe she stopped after she fought for a while.

1102
01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.630
Yeah,
that was the issue.

1103
01:03:33.690 --> 01:03:38.690
<v 3>I interviewed her in Bangkok and we fought with her a little bit and uh,</v>

1104
01:03:39.181 --> 01:03:42.360
I got to say she could kick the shit out of people,
but you know,
she,

1105
01:03:42.410 --> 01:03:44.720
she was accusing guy fighting other guys.
But you know

1106
01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:50.710
<v 6>it's ice feel for those people.
I understand that my body would,</v>

1107
01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.240
whenever it gets you through the fucking day,
however not

1108
01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:57.260
<v 3>however,
however,
if it's,
if you're,
if you're talking about sports,</v>

1109
01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.570
you sit there and say,
I don't know what we're looking at.

1110
01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:01.830
<v 6>Well,
you're not even just talking about sports.</v>

1111
01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:06.860
He's talking about the most violent sport in the world and a sport which I

1112
01:04:07.031 --> 01:04:12.031
understand and I am telling you from a perspective that very few people enjoy.

1113
01:04:12.490 --> 01:04:14.980
I'm telling you from the most honest perspective possible,

1114
01:04:15.130 --> 01:04:17.830
I have called more than a thousand fights.

1115
01:04:17.831 --> 01:04:22.180
I don't know how many fights I've ever done commentary on over 10 plus years of

1116
01:04:22.181 --> 01:04:26.200
doing it.
A man has an advantage.
There's a big difference.

1117
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:27.970
There's not a little difference.
It's a big deal.

1118
01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:28.820
<v 3>Prince,</v>

1119
01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:33.820
we'll also then you start to deal with the questions of their steroids involved

1120
01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.580
as different things and enhancements and other weird shit that's involved in all

1121
01:04:37.581 --> 01:04:37.790
that.

1122
01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:41.510
<v 6>Also,
the predatory mind of the mail is a very different mindset,</v>

1123
01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.080
but also you're 30 years old and you get your Dick cut off at 30 right?

1124
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:49.100
You've got 30 years a man live in.
Okay.
There's a different thing.

1125
01:04:49.101 --> 01:04:50.110
Fighting and,

1126
01:04:50.111 --> 01:04:54.050
and dealing with bullshit and dealing with violence and dealing with,
you know,

1127
01:04:54.350 --> 01:04:56.030
possible death when you're,

1128
01:04:56.031 --> 01:04:57.950
when you're hanging out with a bunch of creepy people,

1129
01:04:57.951 --> 01:05:01.560
when you're 18 years old is a bunch of violence,
sexual men and you were in a,

1130
01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.770
you know,
anything can happen,

1131
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:08.990
especially if there's a little money and very few parental influences with a

1132
01:05:08.991 --> 01:05:10.850
positive.
You could,

1133
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:14.150
there's some dangerous shit if you get through all that and then you cut your

1134
01:05:14.151 --> 01:05:16.850
Dick and balls off.
You still lived all that.
You're still a man.

1135
01:05:16.851 --> 01:05:18.370
You're a violent motherfucker.

1136
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.330
<v 1>You're still a dangerous dude that happens to want to be</v>

1137
01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:24.210
<v 3>woman.
Why are you getting in Shit?</v>

1138
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.310
<v 1>Because I said that,
uh,</v>

1139
01:05:26.311 --> 01:05:30.030
although I support anybody becoming transgender,

1140
01:05:30.031 --> 01:05:31.020
if that's what you really want to do,

1141
01:05:31.021 --> 01:05:34.530
I would never tell anybody what they can and can't do,
can and can't do.

1142
01:05:34.531 --> 01:05:39.150
But you shouldn't be fighting women.
Maybe a tranny league,
you know,

1143
01:05:39.151 --> 01:05:43.190
and I don't say tranny and it's not derogatory until it is.
I mean,

1144
01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:45.990
I mean it didn't.
The,
the guy from Bravo get in trouble for

1145
01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:50.670
<v 3>you use the word twink.
I don't know.
Trust me,
I just remember,</v>

1146
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:55.730
I remember seeing,
I remember seeing a video of these big sort of,
uh,

1147
01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.170
you know,
Ozzie rugby player types and they,

1148
01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.060
they I guess were fucking with some trainee lady,
boy,
whatever.

1149
01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:06.580
And The lady bug kicked the shit out.
And I'm like,
just flatten these three rug.

1150
01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:11.220
I guess they were actually MMA or there was something that we go when we tie or

1151
01:06:11.221 --> 01:06:15.150
some,
some sort of fighting and just trying to kick this fucking level them.

1152
01:06:15.151 --> 01:06:17.970
It's on youtube.
Oh,
that's hilarious.
And I was just like,
well,

1153
01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:21.630
you got to think that,
you know,
if you're a,
if in most countries,

1154
01:06:21.631 --> 01:06:22.351
maybe not tell him,

1155
01:06:22.351 --> 01:06:26.580
but if you're a lady boy or she male or transgendered or whatever,

1156
01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:31.900
there are fighting all the fucking time,
you know?
And so,
so anyways,

1157
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:35.170
I,
I saw that video and it was just kinda like,
cause I hate those.

1158
01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:40.710
I was just in Thailand at a conference and disease,
all these fucking,
you know,

1159
01:06:40.711 --> 01:06:44.940
Australia and uh,
sort of rugby dudes who are just spoiling for a fight.

1160
01:06:44.970 --> 01:06:47.260
Just they would just want to go or they just want to fight.

1161
01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.730
<v 1>You know what those guys need to do.</v>

1162
01:06:48.731 --> 01:06:52.690
They need to get out of rugby and get into some Nma.
If you want to fight,

1163
01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:55.810
you should be fighting that and I would tell them that.
I'd be like,
look bro,

1164
01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.550
you're a bad motherfucker.
It's obvious you're,
you're,

1165
01:06:57.551 --> 01:07:00.910
you're the reason why you're trying to fight it bars as you need to be testing

1166
01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:05.760
yourself in,
in that way,
in,
in a gym.
I agree.
Get,
get well,

1167
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:10.210
get it.
Take a leg kick,
defend the choke.

1168
01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:14.710
Come on,
stop it with your stupid ball.
That's a goddamn euphemism.

1169
01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.750
Who gives a fuck what happens with that ball?

1170
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.490
You take away your nutty score thing with one.
Oh,
you got a point.

1171
01:07:21.491 --> 01:07:25.330
Woo.
Oh No,
they did what we didn't want them to do.
That's all nonsense.

1172
01:07:25.331 --> 01:07:26.560
What you're doing is trying to stop.

1173
01:07:26.561 --> 01:07:30.700
What you really want to do and when you really want to do is one on one man to

1174
01:07:30.701 --> 01:07:34.840
man someone your size.
No mechanical advantage,
no weight advantage.

1175
01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:38.410
Let's see.
Let's see what's going on.
Let's see what's going on there.

1176
01:07:38.411 --> 01:07:42.880
So any rugby player that shows up and wants a fight,
stop being a buzzy.

1177
01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:48.320
Send them to you.
I will help them.
I was saying you're a bad motherfucker.

1178
01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.810
These are rage inside of you.

1179
01:07:49.811 --> 01:07:54.250
You need to project that shit in the right way and this ball thing isn't working

1180
01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:57.100
out.
We needed to leave that ball alone.

1181
01:07:57.101 --> 01:08:00.190
Nobody gives a fuck if you get it across that line,
that's nonsense.

1182
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:03.610
You're playing a game.
Oh,
you kicked it between the two sticks.

1183
01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:08.200
The world is changed.
No one hasn't.
Nothing's changed.
Okay,

1184
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:09.190
you still,

1185
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:11.620
you're fighting off those bullies that fuck with you when you were in the

1186
01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:15.100
seventh grade.
What you need to do is some fucking Kettlebell son,

1187
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.190
some body weight

1188
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:19.790
<v 8>squats.
Learn some Jujitsu,
chokes and bitches out.
Get it out of your system.</v>

1189
01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.650
Stop fighting in bars.

1190
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:25.670
Stop letting the demon alcohol bring it out of your body.

1191
01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:29.450
I agree with you cause they just blow my fucking,
they harsh my butter.

1192
01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:33.340
They do hard.
They harsh by bus to man because the,

1193
01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:38.030
the guys that are that get it out in the gym,
they don't look for it anywhere.

1194
01:08:38.060 --> 01:08:38.730
Well I'll tell you what,

1195
01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:40.890
<v 3>when you drink,
the real you comes out in.</v>

1196
01:08:40.891 --> 01:08:44.430
The real me is just a jovial 80 year old man.
I'm like fucking Buddha.

1197
01:08:44.431 --> 01:08:46.770
I'm just sitting there and drinking my drink.
I'm having a good old time.

1198
01:08:47.190 --> 01:08:51.540
And you know when you see these dudes come out and they have a few drinks in

1199
01:08:51.541 --> 01:08:56.460
them and they get all ran to fight and you're just like,
yes.
You know,
anyway,

1200
01:08:56.650 --> 01:09:00.550
<v 8>it's not unnecessary.
It's not,
it's not good for them.
They all need hugs.</v>

1201
01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.240
They all do,
man.
And I mine,
you know,
you and I,

1202
01:09:04.241 --> 01:09:07.190
you and I both know if you're a real fighter you won't fight in a bar.
No.

1203
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:10.240
Well why would you want to hit someone that doesn't want to get head?

1204
01:09:10.241 --> 01:09:12.070
It doesn't want to fight.
And if they do want to fight,

1205
01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:15.490
is it possible that can be avoided but talking,
and if it's not there,

1206
01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.530
probably a bitch.
Boy,

1207
01:09:17.531 --> 01:09:20.730
you're crazy or you're not going to find a birthstone was gonna take a bunch of

1208
01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:23.630
guys like tank Abbott that will fight you anywhere.

1209
01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:28.240
He'll fight you on a plane and he's a real fighter.
It's just,
that's that dude.

1210
01:09:28.241 --> 01:09:30.640
That's what he's all about.
You know?
And it's not about,

1211
01:09:30.641 --> 01:09:34.790
you don't shut those professionals.
A guy like tank Abbott is,

1212
01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.760
he's one of my favorite fighters of all time.

1213
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.490
And one of the reasons why it's not because he was the bass,

1214
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.660
not because he was the most technical or one the most titles,

1215
01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.730
is that you genuinely knew for a fact,
100% no doubt about it.

1216
01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:52.720
If you fucking flap your gums in front of tank Abbott,

1217
01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:54.540
he's going to make you swallow your teeth.

1218
01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:58.390
Doesn't matter if you're on a greyhound bus or on a fucking space shuttle,

1219
01:09:58.510 --> 01:10:02.620
he's gonna beat your ass.
And there's a reality to that,

1220
01:10:02.621 --> 01:10:06.580
that I find refreshing,
like drowning in the ocean or,

1221
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:08.380
or getting hit in the head by a media.

1222
01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.210
There's certain unavoidable consequences to being in the wrong place at the

1223
01:10:13.211 --> 01:10:14.044
wrong time.

1224
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:16.780
<v 3>Most of the,
and you know,</v>

1225
01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.190
many more 90 but the most professional fighters are fighters who,
you know,

1226
01:10:21.191 --> 01:10:23.650
do it for living,
aren't going to get to a fight in a bar.

1227
01:10:23.651 --> 01:10:26.140
Cause I'm only going to take a ball to her head down and fuck up your hand.

1228
01:10:26.141 --> 01:10:26.920
You're gonna to something

1229
01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:27.400
<v 8>that,</v>

1230
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:32.400
or they would and they would clean out the whole bar and you have a real problem

1231
01:10:32.411 --> 01:10:36.640
on your hands because it's only a guy like Randy couture and Dan Henderson.

1232
01:10:36.641 --> 01:10:38.590
I Dunno if this is a true story or not,

1233
01:10:38.591 --> 01:10:42.340
but there's a legendary story about those two guys in high in college when they

1234
01:10:42.341 --> 01:10:46.950
were pulling like elite wrestlers just cleaning out a ball.
You know,

1235
01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:49.980
I don't know if it's true.
I never talked to Randy about it,
but,

1236
01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.900
but what I can tell you if what I know about Randy,

1237
01:10:52.901 --> 01:10:56.740
I've been around that guy for,
I saw his first fight in the UFC.

1238
01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:00.850
He fought Tony Halma and then he fought this,
a really promising kid.

1239
01:11:00.851 --> 01:11:03.010
I forget his name,
Kevin something or another,

1240
01:11:03.250 --> 01:11:07.270
and he beat both of these guys and I was like,
wow,
this guy's a stud.

1241
01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:10.810
Like this guy is the,
the,
the real fucking deal.

1242
01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:16.290
He is one of the people you could ever be around.

1243
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:21.470
You would never imagine that Randy coture would ever get into a street fight.

1244
01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.920
Right?
If you're talking to that guy,

1245
01:11:22.921 --> 01:11:26.100
whether it's in a bar or a Denny's or a bowling alley,

1246
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:28.230
he's US smiling.

1247
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:33.231
Handshaking comfortable pat you on the back gentlemen.

1248
01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:37.170
Like you would never imagine that anybody would ever find themselves so cunty

1249
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:39.540
that there would be in a fist fight with Randy coture.

1250
01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:41.670
<v 3>Did you ever hear that story,
uh,</v>

1251
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:45.190
about Tyson and there was a gush blood green.
Yeah.

1252
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:49.680
<v 8>Yeah.
They fought in the bar and didn't he?
It?
No,
no,
no.
It wasn't even a bar.</v>

1253
01:11:49.681 --> 01:11:53.040
It was in a,
what are those fancy words for uh,

1254
01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:57.810
when the haberdashery or something like that when you get like a dope ass

1255
01:11:57.811 --> 01:11:59.460
fucking pimp suit.
Yeah.

1256
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.180
It was like two o'clock in the morning in Harlem and Mitch Bled Green had been

1257
01:12:03.181 --> 01:12:06.960
taunting Mike Tyson forever and Mike broke his hand.

1258
01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.770
Mitch Greens face.
Yeah,

1259
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:14.020
<v 3>mid screen had like 28 surgeries to like cause cause orbital I believe.</v>

1260
01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.780
Yeah,
he came in his face,
he broke his hand on his face,

1261
01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:21.520
caved in his face with one punch and you're just sitting there saying okay,

1262
01:12:21.521 --> 01:12:24.820
with one punch he caved in Dude's space.
He had to have 28 surgery.

1263
01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.940
And by the way,
this guy's,
this guy's a professional fighter.
Yeah.

1264
01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:32.560
Well he gets paid to get fucking hit in the face and you get one punch and it

1265
01:12:32.561 --> 01:12:33.860
gives you 20 days.
I wish

1266
01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:38.270
<v 8>what he wanted to do,
he dragged the guy into the ring that had no business.</v>

1267
01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:42.230
He had no business challenging Mike Tyson.
He really wasn't at that level.

1268
01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.160
And by his persistence and his arrogance,
he really did get that fight.

1269
01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.400
And you saw it,

1270
01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:52.600
but you saw in that fight why he wanted that fight and why he wanted that fight.

1271
01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:56.120
Is Mitch Blood Green even though he had no business being in the rink?

1272
01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:59.420
Technically with Tyson,
he didn't get stopped.
I said,

1273
01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:02.090
beat the fuck out of that guy and he couldn't put them away.

1274
01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:06.200
That was an amazing fight.
If you think about it,
cause Tyson was in his prime.

1275
01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.120
That was the Tyson.

1276
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:12.120
That was starch and guys just Tyrrell big is an Olympic gold medalist was just

1277
01:13:14.331 --> 01:13:18.770
running for his life,
trying to keep the jab on that guy.

1278
01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:23.090
Jesus Christ.
He's just rep into your body with that.
Right?

1279
01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:25.550
Why to the body in that right upper cut,

1280
01:13:25.670 --> 01:13:29.150
that shit was legendary and Mitch Blood Green made it through that and the

1281
01:13:29.151 --> 01:13:30.140
reason he made it through that,

1282
01:13:30.141 --> 01:13:32.840
it's the same reason why he wanted to fight Tyson in the first place.

1283
01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:35.840
He was convinced that he was the baddest motherfucker on the planet.

1284
01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:40.190
He got his face,
cavemen sort of.
He did.
He got beat up,
but he was all right.

1285
01:13:40.191 --> 01:13:40.431
I mean,

1286
01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:43.520
it's really amazing when you think about it because who the fuck was training

1287
01:13:43.521 --> 01:13:47.420
bitch?
Blood Green,
you know,
I mean I don't,
I don't know who is trained is where,

1288
01:13:47.421 --> 01:13:49.010
I mean it might've been someone really good,

1289
01:13:49.011 --> 01:13:53.570
but I had to think about his approach.
It was,
there was a part of,

1290
01:13:53.571 --> 01:13:57.080
it was kind of brilliant.
Forced Mike Tyson and the fighting him,

1291
01:13:58.550 --> 01:14:02.810
you know,
but that Mike Tyson,
that was the,
that was the best Mike Tyson,

1292
01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:07.760
that era,
that Marvis Frazier era.
That was a,
that was our,
our Joe Lewis,
you know,

1293
01:14:07.761 --> 01:14:12.040
that was our Sonny Liston.
That was our,
uh,
our whoa.
Without that one guy,

1294
01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.590
<v 5>that Mitch Blood Green thing.
Man,
that was a long time.
We're like old man.</v>

1295
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.640
We're all just fuck.
We're like this

1296
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:29.220
hit pitch and you'd stay down and hits you.

1297
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:32.120
Which one lick?
It was all over.
What,

1298
01:14:32.121 --> 01:14:35.190
what was that video you told me to look up earlier to see if it was,
uh,
what,

1299
01:14:35.191 --> 01:14:37.020
what,
what the name was for advice.

1300
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:40.120
Cause I t I typed in Hyman advice and that's not that,

1301
01:14:43.740 --> 01:14:48.290
that's it.
Hey hine,
Mo's arctic refuge is what it calls.

1302
01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:51.330
That got me sold.
And then um,

1303
01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:56.690
and then David chose a search for the dinosaur and the dinosaur that got you

1304
01:14:57.651 --> 01:15:01.420
here about speaking of pine loan.
So we went to [inaudible],
we went to the,

1305
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:04.860
<v 3>did the Arctic through this guy lived out in the middle of nowhere and you know,</v>

1306
01:15:04.861 --> 01:15:08.490
he lived with his,
his wife out there and literally in the middle of nowhere,

1307
01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.120
it was the most isolated person on earth until they found,

1308
01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:13.080
I don't know if you've heard about this,

1309
01:15:13.081 --> 01:15:16.290
this Russian family and hear about them in Siberia.

1310
01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:21.090
They were like Russian Orthodox and during the communist revolution they went up

1311
01:15:21.091 --> 01:15:23.520
to this mountain that some nearly impossible to get to.

1312
01:15:23.521 --> 01:15:26.660
And they lived in this little shack and,
and,
and,

1313
01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:29.610
and the live like they didn't even have shoes with generous thing cause I don't

1314
01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:31.530
know how you get nugget get frostbite and Siberia,

1315
01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.970
but they'd wrap their feeding like Birch Bark and Moss and shit.
And they were,

1316
01:15:35.971 --> 01:15:38.250
you know,
they,
they're eating seeds and they lived up there.

1317
01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.910
The guy was like 90 years old and they finally came in and he had his family,

1318
01:15:41.911 --> 01:15:46.050
they were there and they were like 70 and 60 and shit and they finally arrived

1319
01:15:46.051 --> 01:15:50.070
and they had like iPods and and everything.
And,
and when they got there,

1320
01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:54.960
they had lived this whole people that showed up had iPods.
No,
no,
no.

1321
01:15:54.961 --> 01:15:57.650
The family had not been isolated since the forties right?

1322
01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.040
I believe in the 1930s yeah,

1323
01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:02.790
it was in the 1930s they've been isolated up there and doesn't know about World

1324
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:05.040
War II.
We did not know about World War II.
Correct.

1325
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:09.750
They didn't know about anything and they had literally like sort of learned how

1326
01:16:09.751 --> 01:16:12.660
to,
how to make shit out of bark and everything in that,
you know,

1327
01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:15.270
complete survival.
This shit.
How many people were up there?

1328
01:16:15.810 --> 01:16:18.300
I think there was six of them and then,
and then they all died.

1329
01:16:18.301 --> 01:16:21.780
It was weird because they except the one,
so this is an interesting story.
They,

1330
01:16:21.781 --> 01:16:25.170
they,
they,
they,
they,
they got found and they found out,

1331
01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.150
oh there's another world out there and whatever.

1332
01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:31.940
And then one by one they died very quickly after they got found except for like,

1333
01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:36.870
I believe the youngest daughter is now in her late seventies and she went to the

1334
01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:39.630
nearest Siberian town,
sort of live there for a while and said,
you know what?

1335
01:16:39.631 --> 01:16:40.450
Screw this.
And she went

1336
01:16:40.450 --> 01:16:43.360
<v 5>back.
She's like 77 year old woman backed by herself.</v>

1337
01:16:43.361 --> 01:16:45.130
She went back by herself and she's still there,

1338
01:16:45.131 --> 01:16:47.890
so we want it to go up there and do like the hi Mo,

1339
01:16:47.950 --> 01:16:51.430
the most isolated person in the world,
which was was a woman.

1340
01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:55.090
It's a woman and she's in her seventies and she's going back up this mountain

1341
01:16:55.300 --> 01:16:58.810
where you can't like,
do you hear that?
Pussies?
Okay,

1342
01:16:58.811 --> 01:17:01.780
all you fucking weak bitches complaining,

1343
01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:07.840
but Chevron the office by nine are you fucking kidding me?

1344
01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:10.370
This is a hundred Carl's on the way to work.

1345
01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:15.410
You're complaining is a 70 year old crazy bitch on a donkey and it's 80,000

1346
01:17:15.411 --> 01:17:20.150
degrees below zero and she's by herself and Russia 600 miles away from the next

1347
01:17:20.151 --> 01:17:23.270
nearest person.
She prefers it.
She prefers it up.
She went back.
She went,

1348
01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:27.620
what's wrong with that crazy bitch?

1349
01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.360
I bet she has a pussy like a softball Mitt and I bet.

1350
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:33.550
I don't even know what that means.

1351
01:17:33.551 --> 01:17:38.551
Is it just us fucking thickly padded wall and a lot of pressure.

1352
01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:44.900
She could catch up that imagine the weird shit that happened amongst those five

1353
01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:47.170
people sexually.
No,

1354
01:17:47.190 --> 01:17:50.630
but for for 70 fucking years.

1355
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:54.050
No cheese alone on a fucking mountain.

1356
01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:57.590
It was tenuous orgy at the end.
They probably checked it for sperm.

1357
01:17:57.591 --> 01:18:00.380
There was nothing left.
Might be awesome.
No,

1358
01:18:00.381 --> 01:18:04.320
you fucking your kids and your sisters,
so that's not the aim.
Shut up.

1359
01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:10.340
That's fucking a communism.
Yeah,
I don't think it would be good.

1360
01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.150
Okay.
I don't think it'd be good to have no TV.
I think that Shit's nonsense.

1361
01:18:14.151 --> 01:18:15.290
Why not be a woodchuck?

1362
01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.500
But they were eating out there eating beavers and fucking your kids eating.

1363
01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:20.780
I don't think that they're eating like bark

1364
01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:27.200
bark off your son's death was the last time you had a diet coke.
What?

1365
01:18:27.230 --> 01:18:29.870
Look at that guy is living in shit.
He's not.

1366
01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:32.290
He's in 2013 but he lives like he said,

1367
01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.880
these are the questions that come to me when you're like,
okay,

1368
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:38.300
these people are eating bark and putting,
you know,
Mohs on their feet for shoes.

1369
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:41.720
And I'm sitting there going,
boy,
they're just bringing us more and more booze.

1370
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:44.780
Which you think and do you want to survive the Zombie?

1371
01:18:45.170 --> 01:18:49.490
I was when I was going to say to you is,
and this is a serious question,
right?

1372
01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:53.840
Oh No,
no,
not that's true,
but you,
when you look at it,

1373
01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:57.620
<v 3>shit like that,
you can say,
okay,
these people are up there eating bark.
Right.</v>

1374
01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.410
And there's a lot of shit him.
We were talking a little bit earlier,

1375
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:05.960
how much of your life revolves around,

1376
01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.153
yeah,
there you go.

1377
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:12.290
How much per year of life revolves around the pleasure that food?

1378
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:13.603
Booze.

1379
01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:15.750
<v 5>Oh yeah.
You know,
Nice.</v>

1380
01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:20.820
Before the podcast started about making the choice between booze and food,

1381
01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:25.920
like if you could eat whatever the fuck you wanted it to be healthy and live til

1382
01:19:25.921 --> 01:19:28.230
you're fucking 19 all that shit.
Or,

1383
01:19:28.260 --> 01:19:31.860
but you couldn't drink this or you could drink,
but you can't eat shit.

1384
01:19:31.861 --> 01:19:35.460
You've got to eat cardboard and fucking grape leaves.
Oh,
okay.

1385
01:19:35.461 --> 01:19:39.920
Well I'm not going to work great.
Please keep current board and fucking grass.

1386
01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:44.610
I truly believe that living without good food and living without,

1387
01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:48.270
uh,
I mean,
if you're going to survive,
you're,
you know,

1388
01:19:48.271 --> 01:19:51.330
if you're living in the walking dead and you got to shoot deer and shit,

1389
01:19:51.331 --> 01:19:54.510
that's all well and good,
but we're talking about in this day and age,

1390
01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:57.010
I'm talking to you have a choice if you have to make it.
Yeah.

1391
01:19:57.070 --> 01:20:02.070
<v 3>Choice between I can eat my favorite shit or I can drink booze and,</v>

1392
01:20:02.300 --> 01:20:05.280
and,
and have the added sort of crank that,
that give

1393
01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.980
<v 5>right.
Everything in your life.
Well,
what I was going to say was that</v>

1394
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:11.820
<v 1>the,
the idea of,
you know,
subsistence living is,</v>

1395
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:16.170
although frightening that food is delicious.
Eating deer over a campfire,

1396
01:20:16.171 --> 01:20:20.160
that's a really yummy tasting food,
right?
If you're saying like shitty food,

1397
01:20:20.161 --> 01:20:22.830
like cardboard tasting the land,
food,

1398
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:28.170
that's a big three enjoyment of the day,
in my opinion,

1399
01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.810
a meal with my family.
I think is,
uh,

1400
01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.290
I have one of my favorite things in life and that sounds like it sounds uttered

1401
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:37.710
like utter horse shit people.
But,
um,
the,

1402
01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:41.280
the real idea is like sitting down with your kids and having a laugh and having

1403
01:20:41.281 --> 01:20:42.114
a meal.

1404
01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:47.180
I think that that whole processes is very important and nutrition is very

1405
01:20:48.361 --> 01:20:52.710
important.
But for me the taste is very important as well.

1406
01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:55.990
I think it's important to eat things that are delicious.
It fee,
it's like a,

1407
01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:59.700
it's a part of like a pleasurable aspect of life.

1408
01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:05.060
And so if I had to choose honestly between drinking booze and eating delicious

1409
01:21:07.561 --> 01:21:09.450
food,
I would go with delicious food.

1410
01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:13.950
I think delicious food is more important because I've experienced the booze and

1411
01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.360
I understand the lessons,

1412
01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:20.720
the lessons of the dropping of the inhibition and the good aspects of alcohol,

1413
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.380
which are often overlooked by people who just can't handle alcohol.
You know,

1414
01:21:25.590 --> 01:21:28.470
like we were,
we were talking before the podcast started about not,

1415
01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:33.480
there's a certain level of trust that you have where someone is willing to get

1416
01:21:33.481 --> 01:21:38.280
drunk with you.
Like,
you know,
that guy's demons are all,

1417
01:21:38.281 --> 01:21:42.840
they're all right there.
They also took five or six Jack and cokes,

1418
01:21:43.050 --> 01:21:47.580
you know,
challenge,
story about Tiawana and you're like,
Holy Shit,

1419
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:52.800
whoa.
What did you tell your mom?
Well,
she climbed into my,
you know what I mean?

1420
01:21:52.801 --> 01:21:55.010
It's like you get to know a person like,

1421
01:21:55.080 --> 01:22:00.080
and you realize that there's no benefit in hiding all that shit from PBL love

1422
01:22:00.171 --> 01:22:00.840
anyway.

1423
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.760
There's a benefit and telling them and the sort of camaraderie that ensues from

1424
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:09.990
those drunk and conversations of,
of complete and total honesty,
right?

1425
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:14.370
Where were the alcohol does a purpose instead of inhibiting you and making you

1426
01:22:14.371 --> 01:22:18.780
make shitty decisions,
right?
The alcohol releases you from this,

1427
01:22:18.781 --> 01:22:22.770
this idea that anything makes any sense whatsoever,

1428
01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:27.000
and you start telling the truth or you start expressing yourself or you start

1429
01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:29.880
looking at things from more relaxed perspective,

1430
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:33.930
even temporarily with that thought gets planted in your mind.

1431
01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:38.980
And then you just have more of a sense of friendliness the next day.
Like,

1432
01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:42.930
you know,
oftentimes it's little encounters.

1433
01:22:42.931 --> 01:22:44.590
It's steer us and uh,

1434
01:22:45.060 --> 01:22:49.470
like I remember this Andy Anthony robins quote who,
uh,
believe it or not have,

1435
01:22:49.471 --> 01:22:53.580
I've listened to a lot of us books on tape and read his books and he's got a lot

1436
01:22:53.581 --> 01:22:57.240
of interesting ways of looking at things that I really think are enabling.

1437
01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:01.140
But one of the things that he said is that sometimes if two people are going

1438
01:23:01.141 --> 01:23:04.830
along very same path,
like think of yourself as like two boats.

1439
01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:08.680
If one boat just turns one degree to the right,

1440
01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:13.150
like over the course of the boats,
motion through life,

1441
01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:15.100
just that one decision can lead.

1442
01:23:15.101 --> 01:23:20.101
It's so far away from the original path that it was on and that the,

1443
01:23:20.831 --> 01:23:25.270
oftentimes it's a good time that leads you,
you know,

1444
01:23:25.271 --> 01:23:29.020
and it might cost you a day or two of being hung over.
It might,

1445
01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.350
but there might be that phone call we call each other on a Wednesday.

1446
01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:35.410
Like I had a fucking gray type dude.
That was funny.
I even

1447
01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:39.560
<v 3>have to be,
I'm not even talking about like a crazy fucking boozy fucking,</v>

1448
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:40.430
you know,
crazy tongue.

1449
01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:43.790
Because the reason why I asked the question is because whenever I meet people I

1450
01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:46.020
like,
and I respect,
you know,
I,

1451
01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:48.920
I'd like to ask them questions because I believe that's how you learn.

1452
01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:54.230
And so I have this maybe this problem because I'll tell you what,

1453
01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:58.620
I grew up poor.
I grew up dirt poor.
I left home at a very young age and,

1454
01:23:58.621 --> 01:24:02.000
and a lot of what I learned,
I learned,
you know,
initially through books,
you know,

1455
01:24:02.001 --> 01:24:03.690
so I'd read books and then I,

1456
01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:08.110
that's why I have this sort of a intense curiosity about the world because I'm

1457
01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:12.340
like,
oh fuck,
I like to go there and see that for myself.
So anyway,
speaking of,

1458
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:16.130
uh,
so I,
I go to the Ukraine,
you know,
I'm,
I'm not,
you know,

1459
01:24:16.131 --> 01:24:18.500
I'm just a regular fucking dude from butt fuck nowhere.

1460
01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:21.950
And I go there and I had this dinner and,
and,
and,

1461
01:24:21.951 --> 01:24:26.510
and they bring out these potato pancakes with sour cream and caviar and vodka

1462
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:29.180
and all this shit.
And I'm saying,
you know,

1463
01:24:29.210 --> 01:24:31.520
I think it was the first time I carry around and I'm eating it and I'm like,

1464
01:24:31.521 --> 01:24:34.730
this is fucking awesome and I'm loving how we are right off the bat.
Yeah.

1465
01:24:34.731 --> 01:24:37.460
First time I ever had it.
Now granted I was a few vodkas in,

1466
01:24:37.461 --> 01:24:41.000
but you know like Jinchen devop can eat in the caviar and it's Russia and it's

1467
01:24:41.001 --> 01:24:43.190
crazy.
We were up in the middle of fucking nowhere is not Russia,
the Ukraine.

1468
01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.120
We're out in the middle of fucking nowhere and it's some crazy costs.
Act.

1469
01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.640
Shit's going down.
And I'm like,
fuck,

1470
01:24:49.641 --> 01:24:52.310
this is like living in a book and it's crazy.
And I,

1471
01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.670
I literally had one of the best nights of my life.
It was like living in a,
in a,

1472
01:24:55.671 --> 01:24:55.941
in a,

1473
01:24:55.941 --> 01:25:00.050
in a book from the 18 hundreds so I had one of the best times of my life then,

1474
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:02.660
you know,
so for,
for the longest time I'm like,
I fucking,

1475
01:25:02.661 --> 01:25:05.090
caviar is my favorite fucking food and this is the greatest thing in the world.

1476
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:07.040
Then I was shooting in Iran.

1477
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:12.020
So I'm going to Iran when the best carrier comes from now and I'm in my hotel

1478
01:25:12.021 --> 01:25:15.800
room and my story in my hotel in the ran,
the only hotel foreigners can stay in,

1479
01:25:15.801 --> 01:25:19.850
they sell caviar in the lobby.
So I'm sitting there in the lobby and I go,

1480
01:25:19.851 --> 01:25:22.910
fuck yeah,
I love caviar.
That's my favorite shit now man.

1481
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:27.130
So I go and I buy the caviar right in the store.
It's like the best case,

1482
01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:30.380
I don't know.
I bought like $10,000 with the caviar for 100 bucks or some shit.

1483
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:33.560
So I get it and I go upstairs but didn't have no booze.
Right?

1484
01:25:33.561 --> 01:25:34.220
Cause it's the rent.

1485
01:25:34.220 --> 01:25:38.420
So I have like Orange Fanta and some chips in this caviar and I'm like this is

1486
01:25:38.421 --> 01:25:42.710
just fucking salty.
You fucking fishing what the place like shit.

1487
01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.170
What the fuck is it only tastes good when you're drunk.

1488
01:25:45.710 --> 01:25:50.000
I think this is the whole question that I have is that like when you have a big

1489
01:25:50.001 --> 01:25:52.940
fucking Fattal steak with a good glass of red wine,

1490
01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:55.040
how much of it is the fucking red wine?

1491
01:25:55.041 --> 01:25:58.370
And how much of it is the state when you have your linguine with clams,

1492
01:25:58.371 --> 01:26:00.350
with a nice fucking Chris fucking white wine,

1493
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:04.910
how much of it is white wine or whatever.
How is the fucking,
is the,

1494
01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:07.880
is the talk and the,
the thing around,
like you said,

1495
01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:09.170
do you have a meal with your family?

1496
01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:11.240
How much of that is with the family and with the thing.

1497
01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:14.190
And then so when I was sitting up there in,
in,
in,

1498
01:26:14.191 --> 01:26:18.720
in this fucking Shitty fucking hotel room in a,
and this shit,
you know,

1499
01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:20.870
carrier with Phanta,
I'm like,

1500
01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:25.280
actually I probably just enjoyed the fucking evening.
You know,

1501
01:26:25.281 --> 01:26:29.570
I enjoyed the people and the craziness and the fucking Bodkin of caviar and the

1502
01:26:29.571 --> 01:26:32.750
fact that I hadn't had it before and everything went fucking ape shit and all

1503
01:26:32.751 --> 01:26:35.210
that stuff.
Not h I shouldn't save Shit.
They,
it was a,

1504
01:26:35.211 --> 01:26:37.580
it was a very fucking transformative evening.

1505
01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:41.550
And then when I just had the straight up caviar and like,
man,
I don't care.

1506
01:26:41.710 --> 01:26:44.870
It's funny.
What a contrast.
Yeah.
And so,

1507
01:26:44.871 --> 01:26:46.820
so when I was asking you the question,

1508
01:26:46.821 --> 01:26:48.770
cause we were talking about food and you were saying like,
you know,

1509
01:26:48.771 --> 01:26:50.080
if you have a bad back you shouldn't eat

1510
01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:52.160
<v 1>pass.
I'm like,
you know what the Fuck I love fuck fucking Boston.</v>

1511
01:26:52.161 --> 01:26:55.590
You know what I was saying is that this a chiropractor that I was talking to,
uh,

1512
01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:56.501
over the weekend,

1513
01:26:56.501 --> 01:27:01.501
she was explained to me the influence of a certain wheats and a,

1514
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:02.350
uh,

1515
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:07.150
glutens and how it inflamed tissue and that you can get a substantial

1516
01:27:07.151 --> 01:27:10.290
anti-inflammatory response by just cutting wheat out of your diet.
Yeah,

1517
01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.440
I agree with you that there's a pleasure to eating that I think is like super

1518
01:27:14.441 --> 01:27:17.270
important.
It pleasure to eating and a pleasure to drink.
I mean I liked,

1519
01:27:17.290 --> 01:27:21.810
can I smoke weed and not drink cause I would talk to that problem.
No,

1520
01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:24.610
we're not doing that.
For me,
weed is like,

1521
01:27:24.700 --> 01:27:27.040
that's the one that really made a big difference.
Like,

1522
01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:32.220
I think alcohol has played a good part in a lot of positive aspects of my life

1523
01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:33.950
as far as like joyful evening,

1524
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:38.770
having fun with friends and telling them that you love them and hugging them
and,

1525
01:27:39.100 --> 01:27:42.610
and you know,
even whatever,
a romantic altercations.

1526
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.160
<v 3>No,
the boys,
no girls Bro.
Got The shit Brian.</v>

1527
01:27:47.770 --> 01:27:48.490
But

1528
01:27:48.490 --> 01:27:52.030
<v 1>as far as like what,
what transformed me as a human being,
you know,</v>

1529
01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:54.190
marijuana is more important.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1530
01:27:54.191 --> 01:27:57.040
Merritt marijuana was to me like there was like a,

1531
01:27:57.340 --> 01:28:02.340
almost like a missing piece to my sort of conceptual puzzle of like how I

1532
01:28:02.621 --> 01:28:05.890
interfaced with the,
with nature and with the world.
I was like,

1533
01:28:05.891 --> 01:28:08.590
why am I so God Damn Aggro?
Right.
You know?

1534
01:28:08.591 --> 01:28:10.870
And then all of a sudden I find weed and I was like,
boom.

1535
01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.740
<v 3>I know.
Yeah.
I know.</v>

1536
01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:18.240
For me actually booze was my savior because I was hanging out with a lot of

1537
01:28:18.241 --> 01:28:21.660
dudes who are doing some serious,
serious drugs,
bad drugs.

1538
01:28:22.230 --> 01:28:25.800
And my whole thing was,
I don't want to be 60 years old.

1539
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:29.460
And so I always have this,
my idyllic sort of retirement,

1540
01:28:29.461 --> 01:28:31.470
which I'm trying to get to sooner rather than later.

1541
01:28:31.471 --> 01:28:34.710
Now it's just like this sort of forgotten like little cove.

1542
01:28:34.711 --> 01:28:39.120
You know the little codes.
Be a neighbor and I'm just,
I'm solar.

1543
01:28:39.540 --> 01:28:41.670
I'm sitting there at the school.
I'm going to send you this.

1544
01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:45.620
I'm going to send you this,
uh,
this article of this.
How old are your kids at?

1545
01:28:45.630 --> 01:28:49.860
Three and a one and a half.
Dude,
I got a four and a fucking two.

1546
01:28:49.861 --> 01:28:51.660
We get to have a party.
I'm going to tell you,

1547
01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:55.740
I'm going to send you the old boys or girls.
Girls.
Okay.
We've got a big lesbian.

1548
01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.760
Super.
I'm going to send you this article.

1549
01:28:59.761 --> 01:29:01.210
It's a fantastic article.

1550
01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:05.520
A dude who was diagnosed with lymphoma,

1551
01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:08.190
little and phonic cancer,
like the worst cancer you can ever.

1552
01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:11.940
And he was a Greek dude.
You grew up in America,
but like,
you know,

1553
01:29:11.941 --> 01:29:14.730
came here when he was three assumptions.
So he goes back to Greece,

1554
01:29:14.731 --> 01:29:18.840
to this little island in the middle of nowhere and he has to walk up this hill

1555
01:29:18.841 --> 01:29:21.060
every day.
He goes to talk to his buddies,
drinking the wine,

1556
01:29:21.061 --> 01:29:24.390
he's eating the food from the farm or wherever,
and all of a sudden,

1557
01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:27.900
like five years,
but he was given like,
you know,
six months to live or whatever,

1558
01:29:27.901 --> 01:29:31.320
we're not even six weeks to live.
And,
and they said,
well,

1559
01:29:31.321 --> 01:29:33.600
you know what the fuck happened?
You didn't die.
And he goes,
you know,

1560
01:29:33.630 --> 01:29:37.050
I came here and I forgot to die because you know,

1561
01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.200
he's sitting there and,
and there's no stress.

1562
01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:42.090
And he's walking up the hill every day and he's,

1563
01:29:42.091 --> 01:29:45.190
he's drinking wine with his buddies and he's eating the food from the,
you know,

1564
01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:49.050
the fish from the bay and the fucking whenever.
And I sit there and I say,

1565
01:29:49.051 --> 01:29:51.150
you know,
now I'm looking at this shit.

1566
01:29:51.151 --> 01:29:54.990
So my idyllic retirement's basically I'm stealing this guy who killed cancer by

1567
01:29:54.991 --> 01:29:59.991
living this euphoric life of I live on this little cove and I'm drinking my wine

1568
01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:03.270
and I'm sitting out there and I'm just blissing out on reality now.

1569
01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:05.070
That's why I didn't get hooked to heroin.

1570
01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:07.140
That's why I didn't get hooked to fucking crack.

1571
01:30:07.141 --> 01:30:09.330
That's why I didn't get hooked all the shit to my boys got hooked too,

1572
01:30:09.331 --> 01:30:12.840
because I always was thought to myself,
if I fucking get hooked to this shit,

1573
01:30:12.870 --> 01:30:16.560
I'm going to have to age,
die or be fucking quit it.
And if I quit it,
guess what?

1574
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:19.950
I'm never going to be able to sit on that fucking cove where my glass of fucking

1575
01:30:19.951 --> 01:30:22.860
wine sitting up there,
I'm being this blissful old Buddha dude.
Right.

1576
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:26.550
So for me that was boots,
but I will say this,

1577
01:30:26.551 --> 01:30:31.380
we were just in Jamaica filming the snoop stuff over new years and snoop lion

1578
01:30:31.381 --> 01:30:32.490
and we are in this place,

1579
01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:35.760
<v 4>the line that is,
he's the</v>

1580
01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:41.080
greatest guy in one of these,
this guy.
He's one of the best.

1581
01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:43.680
<v 3>And by the way,
now more than ever because like that,</v>

1582
01:30:43.710 --> 01:30:46.260
that shit's been through shit.
That guy's been through.
Shit,

1583
01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:49.650
we don't even fucking understand.
And,
but anyways,
you know,

1584
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:54.750
so we were filming down there and I was in Jamaica and you know,

1585
01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:57.750
genuinely,
I don't smoke a lot of weed.
I was smoking every day.

1586
01:30:57.810 --> 01:31:01.530
I was drinking rum everyday smoking everyday.
I gotta tell you,
I felt like,

1587
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:04.860
I felt like God was touching me.
I was like,

1588
01:31:05.190 --> 01:31:08.070
I felt fucking spiritually fucking,

1589
01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:11.610
<v 1>you know when you've got to start doing eating it,
when you eat it,</v>

1590
01:31:11.611 --> 01:31:16.611
that's when you really get into that sort of a psychedelic love state.

1591
01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:21.300
It's very feminine.
It's a very feminine,
sensitive state,
you know,

1592
01:31:21.301 --> 01:31:23.570
and a lot of people are afraid of that,
you know,
they're afraid of it is,

1593
01:31:23.610 --> 01:31:25.300
it's gonna make you a pussy or it's going to,

1594
01:31:26.550 --> 01:31:29.940
<v 4>but you're not afraid of shit.
No,
no,
no.
You're not afraid of shit.
I'm not afraid.</v>

1595
01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:35.320
We are afraid to sing fucking 80 a lot of shit.
You know,

1596
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:38.960
people always give me,
Oh,
you're afraid to fucking mountain lions and yeah,

1597
01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:42.230
one eight my dog,
you know?
Are you afraid of meteors?
Yeah.

1598
01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:47.210
Watched some TV show where they come from the sky.
Like God damn torpedoes.
Yeah,

1599
01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:50.960
fuck all that shit.
Scared to die,
Joe.
That's why not scared.

1600
01:31:51.710 --> 01:31:54.700
Scared to get locked up and suffer.
You're a happy guy

1601
01:31:55.440 --> 01:31:59.800
<v 3>and you don't want to die.
My whole thing when I was so aware,
but I was a kid,</v>

1602
01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:03.490
I thought I was going to die so I didn't give a fuck I do anything cause I'm

1603
01:32:03.491 --> 01:32:05.860
going to die.
Who the fuck cares what you think you were going to die?

1604
01:32:06.100 --> 01:32:09.730
Cause I was going to die.
I mean you know everybody I grew up with,

1605
01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:13.810
you know when I was a kid died because we were bad guys doing bad shit.

1606
01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:16.030
People die and all this stuff.
How bad were you guys?

1607
01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.753
<v 5>Anybody</v>

1608
01:32:19.670 --> 01:32:22.370
<v 3>does like blood farts on people.</v>

1609
01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:27.760
<v 5>I know Brian.
So it was like,
you know,
look,
you do some gang,
he shit.</v>

1610
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:32.050
You do gang shit.
You Doing Canadian gang,
you share exactly how bad,

1611
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:37.360
how bad you beat.
But no look people get it.
People get into junk.

1612
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:40.270
It doesn't matter if it's,
by the way,
this is the surprising thing.

1613
01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:41.670
Well they get into everything.
Everything.

1614
01:32:41.670 --> 01:32:46.550
<v 3>But you know,
generally the end result is,
is well now it could be met but heroin.</v>

1615
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:50.730
And the thing is,
is even in,
in Shitty sort of Nice Canada,

1616
01:32:51.120 --> 01:32:53.040
people end up on junk or they're doing,

1617
01:32:53.070 --> 01:32:56.330
they start doing more and more serious crimes.
And,

1618
01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:59.730
and this is one of the reasons why my my cove was,

1619
01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:01.920
was my dream was because you know,

1620
01:33:01.921 --> 01:33:05.430
you have guys who are dying of heroin overdoses are guys are going to prison for

1621
01:33:05.431 --> 01:33:10.320
life or worse getting killed.
And,
and you know,
these are 17 1819 year old kids.

1622
01:33:10.321 --> 01:33:11.220
And you're sitting there and saying,

1623
01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:14.450
that's the biggest tragedy is you never fucking live here.
I use it a teenager,

1624
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:16.200
you think you're fucking lived here.
Like you haven't lived shit.

1625
01:33:16.201 --> 01:33:17.610
You haven't done shit.
You haven't seen shit.

1626
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:21.390
And one of the reasons why I say I'm going to go out and I'm going to see shit

1627
01:33:21.391 --> 01:33:23.940
and I'm going to do all this shit,
whatever is because I didn't fucking die.

1628
01:33:24.690 --> 01:33:29.010
But at a certain point you sit there and you say,
look,
you know,

1629
01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:31.440
and I know how hard life is.

1630
01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:36.120
We know fucking what good things are or can beat.
Right.
And,
and can be.

1631
01:33:36.121 --> 01:33:40.380
And also we realized there's a lot of people who didn't make it.
You know,

1632
01:33:40.381 --> 01:33:43.350
there's a lot of people who just for one,
one reason or another,

1633
01:33:43.351 --> 01:33:48.000
they don't get to where you are.
And so that's why now,
anyways,
uh,

1634
01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:48.510
you know,

1635
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:51.330
one of the reasons why I like coming here and having these discussions with you

1636
01:33:51.331 --> 01:33:54.300
is,
you know,
you,
you,
you can actually say,
look,

1637
01:33:54.301 --> 01:33:59.220
I come to these fucking realizations and look,
we're two guys who are saying,

1638
01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.140
you know,
we don't need to fucking fight.

1639
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:04.590
We probably had fucking a hundred fights,
you know,
between us.
Like,
you know,

1640
01:34:04.591 --> 01:34:08.080
we're not saying never.
I've had no street fights.
I had all right,

1641
01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:12.210
the last street fight I had when I was in high school.
That was a really quick,

1642
01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:15.900
you're smarter than me.
I haven't,
I'm,
I've avoided everything.

1643
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:20.250
But I've had actual fights I've had like,
yeah,
you're a taekwondo,

1644
01:34:20.670 --> 01:34:23.910
boxing bouts and motherfucker,
I don't know how many times would no fights,

1645
01:34:23.911 --> 01:34:28.380
but there was a lot of them.
But I've never,
what I'm trying to get at is what I,

1646
01:34:28.381 --> 01:34:33.120
you know,
when you see fights in,
in,
in,
in,
this isn't me trying to do an homage,

1647
01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:35.730
but if you see fights in Iraq or he's,
he fights,

1648
01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:37.290
those fights are different fight.

1649
01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.960
Those fights are like they shoot you in the headlights know.
I'm sure.

1650
01:34:40.230 --> 01:34:44.720
So what I'm trying to say is,
you know,
you want to get to more of a,

1651
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:46.910
of an understanding and this is why I didn't go back there.

1652
01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:48.660
Like I don't give a fuck what people think about me.

1653
01:34:48.661 --> 01:34:51.540
I don't give a fuck about that shit because when you see it,

1654
01:34:51.541 --> 01:34:55.930
you sit there and say on this hand this motherfucker got shot or this guy,

1655
01:34:56.610 --> 01:35:00.620
this guy and into this.
Now to go back to the way long winded,

1656
01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:03.830
but if you go back to it,
what do I want to do?

1657
01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:08.540
I want to sit in the cove with my family,
your family,

1658
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:11.960
hanging out,
have a drink,
enjoy myself.

1659
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:16.160
I don't know how much food and although I'm a fat bastard,

1660
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:18.140
I don't know how much food is going to play into that.

1661
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.710
But I definitely want to be sitting there with that glass of wine looking out at

1662
01:35:21.711 --> 01:35:25.950
that cove and just go on a fucking made it.
I mean,
and that's why I don't get it.

1663
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:27.830
That's why I don't judge anybody because I tell you what,

1664
01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:31.280
everyone's trying to get through the day to get to their Goddamn cove.

1665
01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.740
You're a hundred percent a hundred percent right.
I agree with you so much.

1666
01:35:36.741 --> 01:35:40.250
But we live in a beautiful world where you don't have to choose between the food

1667
01:35:40.251 --> 01:35:43.280
and the bullets.
And I'll tell you what,

1668
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:47.450
I'll tell you what we do live.
I got to tell you,
you know,

1669
01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.480
we live in the fucking country where you can still to this day make your own

1670
01:35:52.761 --> 01:35:57.020
shit happens,
which,
which mode and look I'm an immigrant from,
but,

1671
01:35:57.230 --> 01:36:01.010
but I made my shit happened in this country and I got to say it's the best

1672
01:36:01.011 --> 01:36:04.010
country in the world.
And there's a lot of countries out there.

1673
01:36:04.011 --> 01:36:08.660
We don't realize how fucked up they are and how bad shit is there.

1674
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.340
And we should fucking say,
you know what?
You can do anything here in America.

1675
01:36:13.370 --> 01:36:14.203
So you should,

1676
01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:18.770
<v 1>you know,
when you say that it has so much more weight than the average person,</v>

1677
01:36:18.771 --> 01:36:20.600
including me saying at first of all,

1678
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:22.550
because you've been everywhere and second of all,

1679
01:36:22.551 --> 01:36:25.930
because you came from another place,
you grew up in Canada.
So when you,

1680
01:36:25.931 --> 01:36:28.160
when you come over and you see this situation,

1681
01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:32.940
there's no question this is not perfect.
I think we all agree on it.

1682
01:36:32.970 --> 01:36:37.640
I think it's fucking fantastic.
It's better.
It's better than it's ever been.

1683
01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:39.980
We were,
what we were doing right now is we're,

1684
01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:45.040
we're figuring life out and we still have a lot of old standards and old

1685
01:36:46.041 --> 01:36:50.540
traditions and old things that we abide by that don't make any sense and they

1686
01:36:50.541 --> 01:36:52.460
trip us up.
We step on our own Dicks,

1687
01:36:52.670 --> 01:36:57.670
but I think ultimately we're moving forward in a direction of progress as much

1688
01:36:57.711 --> 01:37:01.040
as people like to be cynical about the possibilities of the future.

1689
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:03.920
I think just where we are today in this country,

1690
01:37:03.921 --> 01:37:08.630
despite the eroding civil liberties,
all that,
that's all good on paper.

1691
01:37:08.631 --> 01:37:12.800
But the reality of the progression of information through the Internet is we're

1692
01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:14.600
taking the world to a different

1693
01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:18.700
<v 3>place.
Not Cynical to criticize.
It's not,
you're right.
And you know what?</v>

1694
01:37:18.701 --> 01:37:23.701
America and democracy was based on honesty and being critical and being allowed

1695
01:37:24.431 --> 01:37:27.400
to be critical because you couldn't say,
fuck the aristocrats.

1696
01:37:27.401 --> 01:37:29.500
Fuck the king and all this.
Should they cut your head off?

1697
01:37:29.890 --> 01:37:34.270
So democracy is based on people like us sitting there and going,
you know what?

1698
01:37:34.271 --> 01:37:36.310
The political system isn't right.
And guess what?

1699
01:37:36.490 --> 01:37:40.810
The political system will not change unless motherfuckers like us and everybody

1700
01:37:40.811 --> 01:37:43.690
listening to this fucking podcast do something about it.

1701
01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:45.470
And that's what America is,
is

1702
01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:47.810
<v 1>you're right,
100% but more importantly,</v>

1703
01:37:47.811 --> 01:37:50.270
the people who are in the positions of power,

1704
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:55.930
it must be reinforced that we are all in this temporary

1705
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:59.880
<v 3>state.
And to make the most of your temporary state,</v>

1706
01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:05.070
you can enjoy the bounty of your work and the fruits of your labor.

1707
01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:09.270
And the,
the,
the overwhelming,
uh,

1708
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:14.100
af you'll affluence that you get from having successfully figured out
capitalism.

1709
01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:19.280
But it's possible to do that in a way where you don't fuck people over and you

1710
01:38:19.561 --> 01:38:24.561
promote freedom and love and all of those possible you have to.

1711
01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:29.190
And if you did,
you would be more happy and more success have to,

1712
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:32.070
you know,
just,
just one quick story.

1713
01:38:32.071 --> 01:38:36.910
But I was hanging out with a guy who inspired the shit out of me and he was,

1714
01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:41.820
he was the president of the Maldives and there was a 35 year a dictatorship

1715
01:38:41.821 --> 01:38:46.790
there.
He got elected against all odds and he did all this shit like um,
you know,

1716
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.170
underwater,
a cabinet meetings and stuff too,

1717
01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:53.100
to bring awareness to global warming cause his country is sinking.

1718
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.630
And so he was gonna buy land in Australia or Sri Lanka or India cause he doesn't

1719
01:38:57.631 --> 01:39:00.150
not going to have a country anymore.
And then the,
they,

1720
01:39:00.170 --> 01:39:03.420
they ousted him and he has this flotilla going around them.
Aldi's,

1721
01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:06.090
which is actually like the size of Europe,
but like islands.

1722
01:39:06.091 --> 01:39:09.750
So he's just fishing boats.
And I went on these,
these,
these,

1723
01:39:09.780 --> 01:39:11.250
these fishing boats with this guys.

1724
01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:15.180
He just called the Mandela of the Maldives because he'd been in jail most of his

1725
01:39:15.181 --> 01:39:19.290
life.
And you know,
I was hanging out with this dude.
And you know,

1726
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.280
one of the interesting things that this guy was doing is he's just saying,
look,

1727
01:39:23.350 --> 01:39:28.290
you're,
you have to,
you have to,
you know,
take individual control.
You have to say,

1728
01:39:28.291 --> 01:39:30.270
look,
unless we do it,

1729
01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.860
unless we as a community fucking say no to this shit,

1730
01:39:35.490 --> 01:39:39.450
it's going to continue because people don't want it to fucking change.

1731
01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:43.110
They just don't want it to change.
Even in America,
they don't want it to change.

1732
01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:46.400
But the thing is is you think that people don't want it to change.
They don't,

1733
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:51.030
hold on,
I'll tell you,
I'll tell you.
So this is my second point is,
is you know,

1734
01:39:51.210 --> 01:39:54.600
for the people of the people bought it and you sit there and say the people,

1735
01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:57.750
this is the country,
the first country that was,

1736
01:39:57.810 --> 01:40:00.920
that was set up not for the aristocracy,
but for the people.
And the thing is,

1737
01:40:00.921 --> 01:40:05.250
is I think that was forgotten because if you actually look at the people and

1738
01:40:05.251 --> 01:40:08.820
what the people want and what the people can do,
people want a good life,

1739
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:11.490
but they're willing to say,
you know what,
fuck,

1740
01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:16.170
I don't want to fucking have all this garbage or whatever the fucking radiation,

1741
01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:20.880
the fucking cause I didn't want to have this,
this uh,
uh,
you know,

1742
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:25.710
threat of,
of,
of a,
of nuclear war and all these things.
If you look at,

1743
01:40:25.711 --> 01:40:29.730
actually if you talk to regular people,
people are saying people are good.

1744
01:40:29.731 --> 01:40:32.130
Actually when you were talking about it,
people actually,

1745
01:40:32.131 --> 01:40:34.440
if you're hanging out with your neighbors,
people are inherently good.

1746
01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.390
People are inherently fucking Nice.

1747
01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:41.460
Yet all this fucking bad shit happens.
Right?
And you're saying,
why is that bad?

1748
01:40:41.461 --> 01:40:46.290
It shouldn't be because people let it happen.
Is it because people let it happen?

1749
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:49.980
Not necessarily because someone has to be initiating it.

1750
01:40:50.130 --> 01:40:53.710
I mean someone has to be willing to take it to lost the train of my thought

1751
01:40:53.711 --> 01:40:53.980
because you

1752
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:58.450
<v 4>guys are doing some weird shit.
I Dunno.
I Dunno what you're doing.</v>

1753
01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:02.100
Listen there was a roach I left trying to figure out where it was.
Yeah,

1754
01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:05.530
that was getting into some deep shit and I fucking know,
I'm sorry.

1755
01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:09.530
I really apologize.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to distract you.
I just,

1756
01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:13.480
I thought you can keep your train of thought.
I couldn't,
I'm a visual.

1757
01:41:13.570 --> 01:41:18.080
I'm a visual guy.
Has roaches isn't old.
Yeah,

1758
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:19.690
exactly.
This box here,

1759
01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:25.290
<v 5>it's a moth eight my sweater.
Um,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
So what,
what,
what was your,</v>

1760
01:41:34.610 --> 01:41:39.610
what I will say is that I think fucking place is haunted I think because I think

1761
01:41:41.421 --> 01:41:45.950
because of where we are with the transference of information,

1762
01:41:45.951 --> 01:41:49.090
like we're doing advice or like you're doing with your podcast when I do it,

1763
01:41:49.091 --> 01:41:51.200
shit that you are right now,

1764
01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:56.180
our government is willing to arrest people,
but that information gets out.

1765
01:41:56.510 --> 01:42:00.470
I got to say,
information does get out.
Wiki leaks,
this,
that,
the other thing,

1766
01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:02.960
information gets out now.
And by the way,

1767
01:42:02.961 --> 01:42:06.800
that's what's keeping governments in check because mainstream media is not

1768
01:42:06.801 --> 01:42:08.270
keeping fucking government in check,

1769
01:42:08.271 --> 01:42:10.240
which is their fucking job when they're not doing it.
Well,

1770
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:12.230
it's really interesting.

1771
01:42:12.231 --> 01:42:15.420
You just brought that up cause I was reading on advice about,
uh,

1772
01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:19.600
Bradley Manning testimony that you guys have released.
Like what,

1773
01:42:19.610 --> 01:42:23.840
what's going on with that?
What is that?
Explain that.
Well I think,
look,
the thing,

1774
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:24.950
the thing that,
that,

1775
01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:30.070
that we're looking at is how much of media is actually,

1776
01:42:31.450 --> 01:42:34.190
you know,
so we actually did this story on Iraq recently.

1777
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:39.110
That is the thermobaric weapons that were destroying,
you know,

1778
01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:42.550
so if you,
if you have to do house,
if you,
I'm doing it right.

1779
01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.560
<v 4>Yeah.
And it's like a pantomime on my head with a go to pantomime.</v>

1780
01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:50.520
I'm sorry if you,
if Ryan snuck out behind me,
he's very childish.

1781
01:42:51.650 --> 01:42:54.600
<v 5>You look at what happened in Iraq,
you know,</v>

1782
01:42:54.650 --> 01:42:58.270
they had these thermobaric weapons with the throne room.
It's if you do,

1783
01:42:58.280 --> 01:42:59.870
if you have to do house to house fighting,

1784
01:42:59.871 --> 01:43:04.130
which traditionally is the worst fighting you can do,
right?
Very difficult.

1785
01:43:04.490 --> 01:43:07.980
They have this weapon where they can,
it's called a small Emmy.

1786
01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:11.090
And what happens is they shoot it into a building,
right.

1787
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:14.270
And it does a heat blast,
which,
which,
uh,
uh,

1788
01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.870
sort of takes all the oxygen out so it kills you right away.
And then it,

1789
01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:21.500
and then it has this massive heat blast and then it implodes the house.
Right.

1790
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:22.601
The problem is,

1791
01:43:22.601 --> 01:43:26.480
is it's suspected that this is the thermobaric weapon is made from depleted

1792
01:43:26.481 --> 01:43:26.931
uranium.

1793
01:43:26.931 --> 01:43:31.931
So what happens is all that dust that goes out there becomes a radioactive

1794
01:43:32.331 --> 01:43:33.770
radioactive or chemically laden,

1795
01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:38.450
and that possibly is responsible for the first Gulf War syndrome that no one

1796
01:43:38.451 --> 01:43:43.410
really sorta figured out.
Correct.
Exactly.
Correct.
And this huge increase in,
in,

1797
01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:47.680
in,
in,
in,
uh,
uh,
Canton rare cancers and,
and,
and,
uh,

1798
01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:51.830
amongst veterans,
well,
well amongst veterans,
also

1799
01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:56.170
<v 3>locals,
people who are living there.
And so,
uh,
you know,
we,</v>

1800
01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:01.280
you have these sort of incredibly bad,
I don't even know what the fuck,

1801
01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:05.110
<v 1>so I'm just telling them no more weed saying,
get away from me with the devil.</v>

1802
01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:09.850
Devil we'd dealt with cabbage.
The devil's cabbage.
Sorry.
So

1803
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:13.970
<v 3>keep killing of,
I've forgotten where I was.</v>

1804
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:17.900
Do you remember what he's talking about?
This is really devolving.

1805
01:44:17.950 --> 01:44:22.930
<v 4>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
You don't know.
We go down to lake drink,
oh,
sorry.</v>

1806
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:27.290
We're going to get it all back.
I don't know what I'm talking about anymore.

1807
01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:33.300
<v 1>At the end of the day,
here's what,
here's what matters.</v>

1808
01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:34.620
Here's what you are saying.

1809
01:44:34.830 --> 01:44:39.830
What you are saying is that you are seeing the best and the worst aspects of

1810
01:44:39.841 --> 01:44:43.350
humanity,
and you truly are seeing this.
Because that's what I was,

1811
01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:48.500
<v 3>I'm gonna say is that these thermobaric weapons have done these things in Iraq.</v>

1812
01:44:49.740 --> 01:44:51.900
And you know what?
I'll tell you what is,

1813
01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:57.000
no one would have ever reported on that before.
Why?
Because you weren't,

1814
01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:01.560
you couldn't,
there were,
there weren't the actual tools to do that.

1815
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:02.731
And for example,

1816
01:45:02.731 --> 01:45:06.360
us just having this discussion today and what we're talking about,

1817
01:45:07.980 --> 01:45:11.880
it didn't exist before because if you were,
you know,

1818
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:15.090
the Washington Post,
even though they,
they,
you know,

1819
01:45:15.091 --> 01:45:18.150
deep throat and Nixon and all this business,
you know,
you,

1820
01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:20.060
because of your proximity to the Pentagon,

1821
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:22.770
you can't lose your fucking seat at the fucking White House table.

1822
01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:25.290
They'll tell you whatever.
Now we can sit here and say,
okay,

1823
01:45:25.291 --> 01:45:28.920
those thermobaric weapons.
By the way,
the story was broken by a marine,

1824
01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:33.570
Ross Caputi,
who was a marine who fought in Fallujah,

1825
01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:38.370
who saw the thermobaric weapons.
The marine broke the story and said,
by the way,

1826
01:45:38.371 --> 01:45:40.260
this is what the fuck was going on.

1827
01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.400
And I'm breaking this story because I saw what happened in Fallujah.

1828
01:45:44.401 --> 01:45:48.270
This is a fucking marine who's saying this?
And you sit there and you say,

1829
01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:52.110
because of the fucking movement of information,
and by the way,

1830
01:45:52.111 --> 01:45:53.250
we're on the cusp of this meeting,

1831
01:45:53.251 --> 01:45:56.400
you asked me to sit here and have a few drinks.
This is why.

1832
01:45:56.460 --> 01:46:00.330
This is why you have to be honest.
So to go back to this story now,

1833
01:46:00.390 --> 01:46:03.420
I've realized that if you look at wikileaks and you said,
okay,

1834
01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:05.340
is wiki leaks good or bad?

1835
01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:10.230
I believe that the freedom of information is imperative to democracy.

1836
01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:13.560
Unless you have transparency,

1837
01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:18.660
unless you have accountancy,
unless you have people accountability,

1838
01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:21.330
not accountancy,
accountability.

1839
01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:25.740
Unless you have people who are going to be held accountable for what the fuck

1840
01:46:25.741 --> 01:46:29.430
they do,
then it's not democracy,
then it's not.
There's no different than

1841
01:46:29.690 --> 01:46:31.880
<v 1>here's what I,
here's what I think about Bradley,
man,</v>

1842
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:34.610
this is the number one most important thing.

1843
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:38.210
There's no way they should have put that guy in solitary confinement.

1844
01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:41.750
There's no way they should have isolated that guy from the rest of the world.

1845
01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:46.900
There's no way they should have made that guy feel like he was going insane

1846
01:46:47.421 --> 01:46:51.870
because he longed for the human touch and he knew that he was being punished for

1847
01:46:51.871 --> 01:46:56.871
releasing information that's inhuman and that's unnecessary with a government

1848
01:46:57.751 --> 01:47:00.030
that doesn't have anything to prove.

1849
01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.930
If a government is being honest and is not hiding anything,

1850
01:47:04.050 --> 01:47:08.760
it doesn't need to take a guy like Bradley manning and put him in some

1851
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:13.790
horrifying state of detention where he has no rights.

1852
01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:18.980
There's no need for any Justin and loving government to treat any of its

1853
01:47:19.231 --> 01:47:20.220
citizens like that.

1854
01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.680
<v 3>Our government is not honest.</v>

1855
01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:28.090
<v 1>I understand that,
but that to their own self,</v>

1856
01:47:28.270 --> 01:47:31.840
there's no benefit in behaving the way they're behaving.

1857
01:47:31.841 --> 01:47:36.841
And that's what needs to be reinforced is that I think they have this idea or I

1858
01:47:37.570 --> 01:47:42.380
don't say they as in like some conspiratorial or overlord on a day.

1859
01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:42.880
What,

1860
01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:47.880
what I think some people who are scared of losing their position of dominance,

1861
01:47:48.610 --> 01:47:53.380
what they're afraid of is they're afraid that people are going to understand

1862
01:47:53.381 --> 01:47:57.520
what's going on and they're going to take over and they get a lock them up and

1863
01:47:57.521 --> 01:48:00.700
they're going to isolate them from,
I've actually see,

1864
01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:03.630
<v 3>you know,
I said something on this podcast one time when I said,</v>

1865
01:48:03.631 --> 01:48:07.260
if you ever go to a war zone,
I can't remember exactly what I said.

1866
01:48:07.261 --> 01:48:09.450
You cried and then the puke and then you freak the fuck out.

1867
01:48:10.110 --> 01:48:13.950
And I had so many people respond to that and they were,
by and large,

1868
01:48:13.951 --> 01:48:17.340
I would say about 98% uh,
ex military.

1869
01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:22.380
Because if you,
if you,
if you talk to the people who go to these things,

1870
01:48:22.381 --> 01:48:23.131
they're like,
oh fuck.

1871
01:48:23.131 --> 01:48:25.830
I didn't know what the fuck I was getting into when I signed up for this fucking

1872
01:48:25.831 --> 01:48:29.580
shit.
I did not have a fucking clue.
And you look at that and you say,
okay,

1873
01:48:29.581 --> 01:48:33.270
before we go to war,
before a government sends people to war,

1874
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:37.960
before Dick Cheney sends people to war,
uh,
saying that it's,
you know,

1875
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:42.930
al Qaeda is being sponsored by Iraq or Iraq having weapons of mass destruction

1876
01:48:42.931 --> 01:48:45.660
or all of which was completely made up.
And by the way,

1877
01:48:45.870 --> 01:48:50.370
made up by the government that the mainstream media then said,

1878
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:51.001
and by the way,

1879
01:48:51.001 --> 01:48:55.530
everybody who had half a brain knew that fucking the secular state of the bath

1880
01:48:55.531 --> 01:48:57.120
party was totally against all kinds of,

1881
01:48:57.121 --> 01:49:01.920
there's no way out God was doing anything.
But nine 11 was the fucking,
you know,

1882
01:49:02.010 --> 01:49:05.130
the,
the sort of carte blanche to go in.
Guess what?

1883
01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:07.260
These mother fuckers lost their lives.

1884
01:49:07.261 --> 01:49:11.160
They lost their limbs are fucking pissing out of fucking catheter bags now.

1885
01:49:11.550 --> 01:49:14.070
And when I said,
you know,
when I first saw a battlefield,

1886
01:49:14.071 --> 01:49:19.071
I fucking cried my eyes out because it was the first battlefield you saw that

1887
01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:24.370
the first real one was Afghanistan.
Wait,
let me get it right.

1888
01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:30.490
And,
and,
and when you see Afghanistan,
Afghanistan in,

1889
01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:34.380
in Kunar province,
and then in the,
on the Pakistani border,

1890
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:37.230
and when you see it,
you just go,
okay,

1891
01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:40.920
this is the worst shit I've ever fucking seen in my whole life.
What did you say?

1892
01:49:42.210 --> 01:49:46.590
You see like,
okay,
you want to get into it.

1893
01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:50.770
There's guts coming out of cavities.

1894
01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:54.040
There's hands,
there is severed heads.

1895
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:59.070
There's like the bodies are not even whether or not human beings anymore,

1896
01:49:59.621 --> 01:50:04.570
just,
it's like cow parts or some shit.
There's blood running into rivers.
There's,

1897
01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:08.440
but more than that,
the dead people aren't so bad.

1898
01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.030
It's the wounded because these fuckers aren't going to walk again.

1899
01:50:13.390 --> 01:50:17.560
They're going to be shipping out of a bag.
You know,
the young kids,
you know,

1900
01:50:17.561 --> 01:50:21.430
and this is the other thing I say is like,
we're sitting here debating,
well,

1901
01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:24.610
Mike cove with my red wine,
or what'd you have a stake?

1902
01:50:24.611 --> 01:50:27.550
Or would you have a glass of boot?
These fucking kids,

1903
01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:32.260
they're never going to be normal again.
And you sit there.
And by the way,
I'm not,

1904
01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:36.400
I'm not,
I'm not saying you can't,
you,
you can't police the world.

1905
01:50:36.401 --> 01:50:39.340
And I'm not saying that there aren't bad people out there that have to be bucked

1906
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:42.610
down,
but I am saying if you do that,

1907
01:50:42.611 --> 01:50:47.110
you better fucking be cognizant of the fact that when you're sending our best

1908
01:50:47.111 --> 01:50:50.080
and our brightest and our fucking nicest fucking kids out there,

1909
01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:54.270
that they're going to be coming home with no legs and no arms and shitting out

1910
01:50:54.271 --> 01:50:58.540
of a fucking bag.
Unless we realize that then we should never go to fucking war.

1911
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:01.620
Having uh,

1912
01:51:01.660 --> 01:51:06.040
having seen that is a perspective that very few people,

1913
01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:07.820
not a lot of people in the military,
no.

1914
01:51:08.110 --> 01:51:11.830
And the kid then people in the military are coming back and it fucks them up so

1915
01:51:11.831 --> 01:51:16.000
much they cannot reenter into fucking society.
Cause when you see that shit,

1916
01:51:16.750 --> 01:51:21.550
it fucks your fucking wiring.
I think we're still operating under this,

1917
01:51:21.630 --> 01:51:22.463
this

1918
01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:26.640
<v 1>behavior pattern that was established before.</v>

1919
01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:31.650
The kind of communication and understanding that we enjoy now exists.

1920
01:51:31.740 --> 01:51:36.120
That's exactly my point.
My point is,
our job is to say,

1921
01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:40.670
<v 3>guess what?
You know,
we're not sitting here saying,
don't go to war.
Don't go what?</v>

1922
01:51:40.671 --> 01:51:44.360
We're sitting here saying,
this is what happens when you go to a UC.
The guys,

1923
01:51:44.361 --> 01:51:48.060
a lot of the guys in the MMA came out of the military.
I

1924
01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:51.840
<v 1>met a kid that had been pronounced dead.
I was,</v>

1925
01:51:52.110 --> 01:51:55.510
it was multiple times.
And I don't mean this guy was trying,

1926
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:58.920
his friend was trying to explain to me the amount of times that this kid had

1927
01:51:58.921 --> 01:52:02.070
been pronounced dead and brought back to life and that he was,

1928
01:52:02.071 --> 01:52:04.890
it was unbelievable.
And the amount of courage that he had shown,

1929
01:52:04.891 --> 01:52:07.560
he apparently had jumped on the grenade.
And it was,

1930
01:52:07.890 --> 01:52:12.480
it was eh,
and intense,
intense,

1931
01:52:12.481 --> 01:52:13.680
intense conversation.

1932
01:52:13.890 --> 01:52:18.890
And all I could think of was this guy unquestionably was a hero from a Joseph

1933
01:52:23.820 --> 01:52:28.650
Campbell's story.
You know what I mean?
I mean he,
he,
there was a what,

1934
01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:29.310
what,

1935
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:34.310
what's exhibited in a true hero is beyond ideology,

1936
01:52:34.980 --> 01:52:39.980
beyond politics and political influence and be beyond special interest groups.

1937
01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:43.830
Would he exhibited?
Is the thing that we aspire to the most.

1938
01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:46.400
That person is willing,
literally sacrifice

1939
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.070
<v 6>their own being for the,
the,</v>

1940
01:52:49.130 --> 01:52:51.920
the health and the welfare of the whole.

1941
01:52:52.010 --> 01:52:55.310
He was willing to dive on a grenade for the rest of his crew.
I mean,

1942
01:52:55.311 --> 01:52:59.870
that's an incredible,
Lee,
a incredibly honorable human being.

1943
01:53:00.930 --> 01:53:04.140
<v 3>Heroes.
We have real straight up heroes.</v>

1944
01:53:04.770 --> 01:53:07.890
But the whole thing is,
is,
you know what,

1945
01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:12.480
I don't want to send our heroes or,
or I don't think anyone in the world,

1946
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:13.390
and that's not even true.

1947
01:53:13.410 --> 01:53:17.640
I don't think anyone in the world should send their arrows to fight a war isn't

1948
01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.340
philosophically correct.
That isn't backable very true.
You know,

1949
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:24.160
<v 6>and I think true heroes,</v>

1950
01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.450
they're the real heroes should be guiding the rest of the heroes.

1951
01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:32.980
And we should figure out a way to make people who exactly understand what

1952
01:53:32.981 --> 01:53:34.810
warfare is really all about.

1953
01:53:34.900 --> 01:53:39.400
Who went and fought should be the fucking voices that we hear about.

1954
01:53:39.401 --> 01:53:42.640
Next time we go and fight because they're the motherfuckers that know what

1955
01:53:42.641 --> 01:53:45.090
fucking time it is and guess what?
No one listens

1956
01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:45.943
<v 3>to them.
Right.</v>

1957
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:49.100
And I'm going to tell you one thing about this podcast is whenever I say,

1958
01:53:49.101 --> 01:53:51.890
you know what,
I fucking saw that shit.
It was bad.

1959
01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:56.480
The response I get from from people who have been there,
they're like,

1960
01:53:56.510 --> 01:54:01.460
exactly,
exactly,
exactly.
And I agree with you 100% if we're going to go to war,

1961
01:54:01.461 --> 01:54:06.410
then we should listen to our fucking veterans because it is not fucking pretty.

1962
01:54:06.620 --> 01:54:10.520
And the people who who make the decisions to go to war or not,

1963
01:54:10.521 --> 01:54:12.100
the people that ever have to go fight

1964
01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:16.310
<v 6>those fucking walls of the only people that are going to understand that
reality,</v>

1965
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:21.550
that reality is so extreme that it can be sort of justified and glamorized and

1966
01:54:23.151 --> 01:54:28.151
glossed over in a fictional sense by people have never experienced it under the

1967
01:54:28.431 --> 01:54:30.710
threat of their own life expiring.

1968
01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:35.930
And that's the reality that those people have experienced that no one who can

1969
01:54:35.931 --> 01:54:40.700
make their decision from an air conditioned room with a custom designed suit

1970
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.470
should ever be allowed to do.

1971
01:54:42.950 --> 01:54:47.030
The only people that are going to understand that reality or the people that

1972
01:54:47.031 --> 01:54:50.120
have experienced that reality.
And as a whole,

1973
01:54:50.121 --> 01:54:54.740
as an organism that respects itself,
it wants itself to evolve.

1974
01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:59.920
We should all collectively get together and say this is completely unnecessary

1975
01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:04.640
for what we're all looking for and what we're all looking for is happiness and

1976
01:55:04.641 --> 01:55:09.641
we can all compete and all of these needs to accomplish and conquer can all be

1977
01:55:10.701 --> 01:55:13.820
satisfied in a very ethical way.

1978
01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:19.180
Like this idea that we have to continue the Gingiss Conway is nonsense

1979
01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:21.590
<v 3>and if,
if there is a war,</v>

1980
01:55:22.220 --> 01:55:27.110
the people who are making that decision have to understand and have to talk to

1981
01:55:27.111 --> 01:55:29.180
the people who have previously been there.

1982
01:55:29.380 --> 01:55:31.940
Cause if you talked to anybody who's gone to Vietnam,

1983
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:36.620
if you talked to anyone who went to fucking Korea during the Korean War,

1984
01:55:36.621 --> 01:55:41.570
if you talk to anybody from World War Two world war one,
Afghanistan,

1985
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:46.010
Iraq,
Bosnia,
anywhere they'll say,
don't fucking do it.
Yeah,

1986
01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:50.730
do you not fucking fucking do it because it's fucking bad.

1987
01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.060
It's really fucking,
but now are there bad people there?
Of course.

1988
01:55:55.061 --> 01:55:58.440
Are there bad fucking motherfuckers out there?
Is North Korea fucking crazy?

1989
01:55:58.890 --> 01:56:00.090
Do you have to buck them down?

1990
01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:03.990
<v 1>Of course you got to give them a hugs.
They need to all colleagues.</v>

1991
01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:07.420
The North Korea needs the most hugs at anybody ever.

1992
01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:11.440
They need someone to take them and give them hugs and say,
listen man,

1993
01:56:11.500 --> 01:56:15.010
that's going down right now.
By the way,
going down,
that's going to be like any,

1994
01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:19.990
any day,
an hour.
You're going to see telling you.
If you listen to me,
please,

1995
01:56:19.991 --> 01:56:23.470
I know this sounds crazy,
but you've already accepted Dennis Rodman,

1996
01:56:23.471 --> 01:56:27.370
so I know you're over the d listens,
Kim,
Kim,
Kim Jong,

1997
01:56:27.490 --> 01:56:32.170
whatever your name is,
sir,
love God.
I'll call you God.
Listen,

1998
01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:35.320
monkey tied on Twitter.
Every buddy knows.

1999
01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:39.820
Everybody knows that you need a hug,
okay?
You know,

2000
01:56:39.821 --> 01:56:44.470
I know.
We all know.
Let's accept that you're the dominant rule of your situation,

2001
01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:47.650
but you shouldn't be because you would be way happier if you weren't.

2002
01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:50.440
It'd be way happier if you let all those people go.

2003
01:56:50.600 --> 01:56:54.520
You'd be way happier if you released all those political prisoners and slaves

2004
01:56:54.521 --> 01:56:58.120
and whatever the fuck you've got going on there with your wacky laws and the

2005
01:56:58.121 --> 01:57:01.600
people that were in prison because they didn't cry long enough after your dad

2006
01:57:01.601 --> 01:57:06.550
died.
If everybody was led out and everybody said,
all right,
settle everybody.

2007
01:57:06.670 --> 01:57:10.010
Settle the fuck down.
Let's vote on this shit.
Let's,

2008
01:57:10.011 --> 01:57:12.340
let's be cool with each other.
Let's be nice to each other.

2009
01:57:12.520 --> 01:57:16.210
And the dominant person,
the dominant ideas,

2010
01:57:16.211 --> 01:57:20.860
the most accepted ideology will pretty much always rise to the top and the

2011
01:57:20.861 --> 01:57:25.030
exceptional people that can influence the groups as long as they're doing it in

2012
01:57:25.031 --> 01:57:28.990
an ethical way and as long as they're truly trying to advance their culture

2013
01:57:29.410 --> 01:57:34.270
could,
but they all need to have a certain amount of,

2014
01:57:36.010 --> 01:57:37.750
of reality in their own head,

2015
01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.290
a certain amount of humility in their own head and a certain amount of

2016
01:57:41.291 --> 01:57:46.291
experiences with dark situations or,

2017
01:57:46.470 --> 01:57:50.250
or bad moments in life or understanding of failure,

2018
01:57:50.290 --> 01:57:53.830
psychedelic experiences,
what are,
or whatever the fuck it is.
But yeah,

2019
01:57:53.910 --> 01:57:57.660
<v 3>I would say for the first time,
and maybe I'm being naive,</v>

2020
01:57:57.690 --> 01:58:01.680
but I would say for the first time in history because of the,

2021
01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:03.013
uh,

2022
01:58:03.300 --> 01:58:08.300
Internet and the freedom of movement of information that you have this,

2023
01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:12.720
this young,
you know,
population,
this huge,

2024
01:58:12.721 --> 01:58:17.721
massive global young population that most obviously is causing change in,

2025
01:58:18.810 --> 01:58:20.250
in,
you know,
Arab spring,

2026
01:58:20.290 --> 01:58:24.540
like in these countries where Gaddafi was never going to fucking leap.
You know,

2027
01:58:24.541 --> 01:58:27.990
Mubarak was never going to leave and forcing change.

2028
01:58:27.991 --> 01:58:30.030
And they're forcing change in Europe,

2029
01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:33.090
forcing change around there because young people are pissed off or unhappy.

2030
01:58:33.091 --> 01:58:36.510
They're poor,
they're broke,
they don't have a lot of,
uh,
opportunities.

2031
01:58:36.511 --> 01:58:38.130
And they're sitting there saying,
we're going to force change.

2032
01:58:38.670 --> 01:58:42.860
I think that that change is coming to Asia.
Yes.
And I think that that change,

2033
01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:45.840
you know,
but I think that changes come is,
is a,
is a,

2034
01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:48.530
is a global phenomenon.
The,

2035
01:58:48.531 --> 01:58:52.570
the world economic crisis has forced us to wake up and we're saying there's a

2036
01:58:52.571 --> 01:58:56.150
lot of young people out there and they're fucking pissed off and they're gonna

2037
01:58:56.170 --> 01:59:00.190
fuck shit up.
And they're either gonna fuck shit up in a,
in a good way.

2038
01:59:00.370 --> 01:59:03.820
And by the way,
I think Arab spring is a positive thing.
Um,

2039
01:59:04.810 --> 01:59:08.590
there's going to be an implosion in Europe if it hasn't already happened.

2040
01:59:08.591 --> 01:59:11.190
And we're just seeing the aftershocks.
Um,

2041
01:59:11.230 --> 01:59:15.010
there's even shit happening here in America,
which,
by the way,
I'm not afraid of,

2042
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:16.090
cause I like change.

2043
01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:20.500
I like things to be sort of stratified and vague because I don't think America,

2044
01:59:20.501 --> 01:59:23.230
if you look at right now,
what's happening in Congress,

2045
01:59:23.260 --> 01:59:26.050
I think American's political system,
the America,

2046
01:59:26.110 --> 01:59:30.610
the political system in America is broken because you have congress just

2047
01:59:30.611 --> 01:59:34.900
fighting each other over things that are detrimental to what,
what's going on.

2048
01:59:35.050 --> 01:59:39.550
<v 5>They all need mushrooms.
They do.
They need mushrooms.</v>

2049
01:59:39.551 --> 01:59:44.470
Everyone does.
It sounds like somebody needs to force them to say,
hey Yo,

2050
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:45.370
they need a mushroom.

2051
01:59:45.371 --> 01:59:49.630
You have to fucking work together for the betterment of this country,

2052
01:59:49.631 --> 01:59:51.190
and the only way to do that is to take,

2053
01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:55.690
because what they're doing is they're working against each other under fucking,

2054
01:59:55.770 --> 02:00:00.250
you should.
Salvia divinorum is legal in 36 states do it.
I'm resetting.

2055
02:00:00.990 --> 02:00:05.860
I'm resetting Friday.
Get a motel six in a bong and let's get this party started.

2056
02:00:05.861 --> 02:00:07.570
All you need as well as butane lighters,

2057
02:00:07.571 --> 02:00:09.790
you've got to heat it to a certain temperature.
Shane,

2058
02:00:09.791 --> 02:00:10.990
do you know anything about dolphins?

2059
02:00:10.991 --> 02:00:14.290
Because I'm swimming with one shower a day and I can't stop it.
Can I,

2060
02:00:14.291 --> 02:00:15.130
can I tell you something?

2061
02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:19.550
<v 3>Yes.
I'm going to tell you the truth.
All right.
So I went down to this dude.</v>

2062
02:00:19.690 --> 02:00:22.580
I much,
I'm not allowed to talk too much about,
but I mean it's just,
say his name,

2063
02:00:22.581 --> 02:00:25.460
Johnny Pigozzi's island in Panama

2064
02:00:26.130 --> 02:00:28.430
<v 5>and I was on a book that's going to get some email out to,</v>

2065
02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:32.570
I was on a boat and I went to a super pod,
you know,
have you ever heard,

2066
02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:37.380
I've heard of,
okay.
Suddenly.
Right.
So I was on a super pot with 3000 dolphins,

2067
02:00:37.381 --> 02:00:40.590
right?
3000 dolphins,
three thousand three thousand dollars

2068
02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:45.900
I saw on craigslist.
Easy.
So what happened is they gave me,
you know,

2069
02:00:45.901 --> 02:00:50.760
to see Bob is so like a James Bond mother fucking thing.
No,

2070
02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:52.440
it's like a lot.
It was a blow job.

2071
02:00:53.220 --> 02:00:56.100
It's a little jet engine that you can keep up with them cause they don't,

2072
02:00:56.130 --> 02:00:58.350
they don't like you if you can't keep up with them seriously,
like,

2073
02:00:58.500 --> 02:01:02.460
well they need to fucking get over that shit.
You can't say mental pictures.

2074
02:01:02.640 --> 02:01:06.120
So I had to see Bob and I were born with that fan or is that some shit?

2075
02:01:06.660 --> 02:01:08.910
I was going on my,
see Bob and I was going with it.

2076
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:13.930
<v 3>The Super Pod,
there's 3000.
This is what I got shit on.
Cause they should a lot.</v>

2077
02:01:14.230 --> 02:01:14.650
I got it.

2078
02:01:14.650 --> 02:01:19.450
<v 5>Pissed on.
I got,
come on.
I saw a baby dolphin being born.</v>

2079
02:01:20.110 --> 02:01:24.360
There was origins stop right there.
Got You.

2080
02:01:24.370 --> 02:01:28.690
The most hard.
No,
I got to tell you what happened.
So,
so,

2081
02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:30.860
so I was on the Seba.
Yeah.

2082
02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:34.540
<v 3>And then eventually,
cause the,
see Bob fucking ran in batteries.</v>

2083
02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:39.030
I was holding onto the side of the boat with my thing,
a snorkel on my,

2084
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:40.040
and

2085
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:42.530
<v 5>that's when all the shitting in the pissing in the coming happened.</v>

2086
02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:47.560
Cause they're all fucking all the time,
fuck continually back for this.

2087
02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:52.150
If they fuck the fuck the fuck and they shouldn't have pissed and it's in a

2088
02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:56.660
super pod,
there's just all this matter.
There's all just kinds of like bits,

2089
02:01:56.661 --> 02:02:01.540
bits of shit going on.
Yeah.
Just everywhere.
They just come me.
And so this,

2090
02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:05.940
this was me,
this was,
this was me being shit pissed and come on,
I was just going

2091
02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:07.353
<v 9>pick it.</v>

2092
02:02:08.490 --> 02:02:10.440
<v 5>I was trying to talk me call.
Yes,</v>

2093
02:02:10.470 --> 02:02:13.560
I was trying to talk to them through my snorkel cause it,

2094
02:02:13.561 --> 02:02:15.690
cause they come close to you.
If you do,
they come,

2095
02:02:15.691 --> 02:02:18.780
they come straight up to you and in fact they'll come.
What you're saying though,

2096
02:02:18.781 --> 02:02:23.270
what if you said
don't let me step out Joe.

2097
02:02:23.271 --> 02:02:24.180
They had this shit on youtube.

2098
02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.290
These videos of all the mating calls I've been training for like two weeks to

2099
02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:32.210
when I came.
No,
come straight out.
No,
no.

2100
02:02:32.220 --> 02:02:34.880
You want killer whale dump.
So come straight up to you.

2101
02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:37.560
I'll come like within two inches.
They'll check you out.

2102
02:02:37.561 --> 02:02:40.900
They like to give you the eyeball.
They want to check.
These were spinners.

2103
02:02:41.010 --> 02:02:43.450
Spinners are the most,
it's like,
it's like Korean.

2104
02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:46.530
I wouldn't finish this hawk to a dolphin.

2105
02:02:47.250 --> 02:02:52.250
I saw [inaudible] fucking in the super pod then and,

2106
02:02:53.271 --> 02:02:55.220
and by the way,
I came out of that,

2107
02:02:55.290 --> 02:02:59.340
the wall and out of it I came out of the water covered,
covered in shit.

2108
02:02:59.341 --> 02:03:03.900
Piss and curtains
and I've got to say I've got it.
No,
no.

2109
02:03:03.901 --> 02:03:08.400
I got to say it was fucking awesome.
It was fucking because,

2110
02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:12.840
because,
because you're in the middle of,
you're in the middle of like,

2111
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:15.570
they're doing some crazy shit in their society.

2112
02:03:15.571 --> 02:03:18.390
You don't understand what the fuck they're all talking to each other.

2113
02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:20.340
They're all talking to each other.
What does it sound like?

2114
02:03:21.060 --> 02:03:23.220
There's like you can get there sooner.

2115
02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:30.820
Kamani dolphin,
they can talk to you.

2116
02:03:30.850 --> 02:03:35.380
How many dolphins are there in the super pod?
There was over 3000 Oh my God.
Okay.

2117
02:03:35.381 --> 02:03:38.920
This is $3,000 and this is just a wild fuck fast.

2118
02:03:39.820 --> 02:03:42.480
That's exactly right.
So you're down there,
you're,

2119
02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:45.630
you got a scuba helmet on and all have Osha.

2120
02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:50.740
I've see Bob [inaudible].
It's basically just you and a wetsuit,
right?

2121
02:03:51.130 --> 02:03:55.390
No wetsuit.
And you're an artist,
right?
No,
there's no,

2122
02:03:55.391 --> 02:03:58.430
but you have a little engine that you push on the button like this.

2123
02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:01.390
There's tiny engine to keep you too.
You can't,
swim is fine.

2124
02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:03.790
They consume rice as fuck,
but they do this.

2125
02:04:03.791 --> 02:04:07.170
The reason why they're called spinners is they do this thing where they're

2126
02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:10.510
having sexual or talks with you and they spin up into the water.

2127
02:04:10.511 --> 02:04:12.990
So you see like hundreds of dolphins spinning up in the air,

2128
02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:17.670
but when you go down into the water,
there's thousands of the dolphins,
like,

2129
02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:20.250
like,
like fucking and,
and like,
you know,

2130
02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:24.210
having babies and shitting and pissing and everything and they're just there.

2131
02:04:24.220 --> 02:04:26.790
They're like actually just hanging out there again,

2132
02:04:26.830 --> 02:04:29.890
came along and stole all the Tilapia.

2133
02:04:30.040 --> 02:04:33.400
I bet that shit was a party in the house.
I'll tell you what,

2134
02:04:33.401 --> 02:04:38.100
that's exactly what it is.
It's not until happier but tuna,
tuna,
whatever.

2135
02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:40.050
<v 4>How long ago were,
uh,</v>

2136
02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:44.100
being dolphins have been the same state for a million plus years.

2137
02:04:44.101 --> 02:04:44.650
Is that correct?

2138
02:04:44.650 --> 02:04:48.070
<v 3>Yeah.
And,
and that's the interesting thing about it.
They have language,</v>

2139
02:04:48.071 --> 02:04:50.290
they have a social norms.
They have all that.

2140
02:04:50.450 --> 02:04:54.660
<v 4>Definitely.
They have names,
three names for each other,
all this shit.</v>

2141
02:04:54.810 --> 02:04:59.390
Their cerebral cortex is 40% larger than a human being.
The hottest often is the,

2142
02:04:59.410 --> 02:05:02.410
actually the pink dolphin.
It's the rarest ones.
So that's like,

2143
02:05:02.450 --> 02:05:06.770
that's like a Japanese girl with the big tits.
Yeah.

2144
02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:11.530
Zoe,
didn't dolphins got some big ass?
Is that a saltwater or freshwater dolphins?

2145
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:15.170
I think Brazil.
Right?
Yeah.
That,
of course they had the biggest,

2146
02:05:15.340 --> 02:05:18.870
have the biggest ass look at these acids on these thoughts,
but I will say,

2147
02:05:18.871 --> 02:05:19.621
I will say,

2148
02:05:19.621 --> 02:05:24.621
I will say spinners or my particular faith that's called 90 pound free.

2149
02:05:25.141 --> 02:05:28.830
I've never been,
I've never been happy until I was accepted by the spinner.

2150
02:05:28.831 --> 02:05:33.600
Paul ever been happy as a human.
That's ridiculous.
I finally have found out.

2151
02:05:33.830 --> 02:05:35.040
Do you ever watch Saturday night live?

2152
02:05:35.041 --> 02:05:38.970
Where you on amphetamines show?

2153
02:05:38.971 --> 02:05:43.440
I'm doing show.
I'm doing this Saturday,
Saturday.

2154
02:05:43.450 --> 02:05:46.960
I'm swimming with the dolphins.
I will say,
I will say it's fucking awesome.

2155
02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:51.030
Explain what you're doing is fucking awesome.
They're putting me in.

2156
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:54.780
This guy has this like pool about the size of the airport.

2157
02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:59.070
It's like regular swimming,
regular swimming pool,
but he has like four dolphins.

2158
02:05:59.071 --> 02:06:03.070
They just shoves it in there and just pretty much I'm swimming pool.
Yeah,

2159
02:06:03.071 --> 02:06:06.880
and he has like this yoga music on and you just fucking swim naked around his

2160
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:10.460
back pool.
How long are these dolphins been in this pool?
I don't know why.

2161
02:06:10.720 --> 02:06:14.610
I don't know how he has to do some sort of porn.
No,
no,
it's not important.

2162
02:06:14.611 --> 02:06:17.160
I don't think it's important.
I really don't think it's boring.
Horny.

2163
02:06:17.161 --> 02:06:20.580
You know that.
I know very [inaudible].
Wait a minute.

2164
02:06:20.790 --> 02:06:23.490
Where are you going to do this?
San Diego.
That's a bit weird.

2165
02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:27.420
It's not like somebody's backyard.
He's getting,
he's going to get,

2166
02:06:27.421 --> 02:06:31.410
give me his address when I get there.
God,
did you getting rape?
Hold on.
Hold on,

2167
02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:35.610
hold on.
Don't do that.
Sounds fucked up.
And you talked to my lawyer.

2168
02:06:35.850 --> 02:06:40.140
What are you doing?
You out of your mind.
Listen,
I've watched it.

2169
02:06:40.141 --> 02:06:43.610
He sent me video lengths.
I've watched people at home going,

2170
02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:48.420
how fucking biggest Rogan's pool.
It is a totally normal backyard pool.

2171
02:06:48.421 --> 02:06:53.040
I don't have a crazy pool.
It seems a lot smaller than it should be.

2172
02:06:53.190 --> 02:06:55.290
Honestly,
it's a regular pool.

2173
02:06:55.350 --> 02:07:00.150
If anybody has for dolphins in my pool,
you're an ass hole.

2174
02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:05.340
Okay?
You don't need to congregate with those types of humans.
I will say

2175
02:07:05.970 --> 02:07:10.090
<v 3>I have some proclivities to play cards and uh,</v>

2176
02:07:10.091 --> 02:07:14.680
I went to Atlanta,
so play some cards and I swam with the dolphins in Atlantis.

2177
02:07:14.681 --> 02:07:17.320
You know,
you swim with them and whatever.
I had a good time.
They're nice.

2178
02:07:17.321 --> 02:07:21.520
Dolphins.
Everybody's nice,
but I gotta tell you one thing.
When you go out,

2179
02:07:21.521 --> 02:07:26.140
when they're wild,
motherfuckers in the pods there,
they could fuck you up.

2180
02:07:26.230 --> 02:07:28.600
They could kill you,
bite you,
fuck you up in the second,

2181
02:07:28.750 --> 02:07:30.850
and you know what they want to do.
What do they want to play with you?

2182
02:07:30.851 --> 02:07:33.640
They want to talk to you.
They want to fucking hang out with you.

2183
02:07:33.820 --> 02:07:36.220
And then you realize these nice,
nice

2184
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:39.520
<v 5>dolphin.
The sharks will fuck you up.
The sharks will get you.</v>

2185
02:07:39.521 --> 02:07:43.060
And even looking for me,
they're looking to do the cleanup crew,

2186
02:07:43.090 --> 02:07:46.780
but they don't kill but office.
By the way,
dolphins,
he meet dolphins eat meat.

2187
02:07:46.781 --> 02:07:49.570
The same Starks do and dolphins will fuck a shark up.

2188
02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:52.540
But what the dolphins for some fucking reason,

2189
02:07:52.810 --> 02:07:56.080
they have this weird affinity with humans.
They won't kill you.

2190
02:07:56.081 --> 02:07:57.970
They won't eat you.
They won't fuck you up.
They'll save you later.

2191
02:07:57.971 --> 02:07:59.110
The sailors always said,
you know,

2192
02:07:59.111 --> 02:08:03.010
the fucking night officers don't have it together either.
I don't know.

2193
02:08:04.180 --> 02:08:07.510
I don't know because I'll tell you one thing.
I've been,

2194
02:08:07.570 --> 02:08:10.290
I swam around sharks and I was shit scared.
Yeah.

2195
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:13.480
When I was swimming around dolphins,
I was not scared at all.

2196
02:08:13.590 --> 02:08:15.960
<v 4>You know why?
We have very polite,</v>

2197
02:08:15.961 --> 02:08:19.200
very nice for like fucking massage settled down

2198
02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:23.120
<v 8>just they don't have thumbs and they know we have done.
It's that simple.</v>

2199
02:08:23.150 --> 02:08:27.620
They don't have thumbs and they know we have guns.
They're not stupid.

2200
02:08:27.860 --> 02:08:32.090
What's going on here is they realized that evolution has blessed them with the

2201
02:08:32.091 --> 02:08:37.091
ability to move through their waters as if they were flying through the fucking

2202
02:08:37.251 --> 02:08:42.251
sky likes super heroes and they don't have to breathe for minutes at a time.

2203
02:08:43.251 --> 02:08:45.740
They can always get to the surface and less.

2204
02:08:45.800 --> 02:08:50.800
Some crafty Japanese dudes have manufactured some sort of a netting that traps

2205
02:08:51.591 --> 02:08:52.190
them in.

2206
02:08:52.190 --> 02:08:55.530
<v 4>I'd just like to say things have gotten real weird at all.</v>

2207
02:08:56.760 --> 02:09:01.040
It's a bowl.
It's a life and death struggle

2208
02:09:01.110 --> 02:09:06.090
<v 8>and the reason why dolphins or is ruthless is the ar is because life demands</v>

2209
02:09:06.091 --> 02:09:10.860
that at the top of the pyramid of fucking craziness.

2210
02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:16.130
<v 4>We're out there.
He's a bit weird going to like it.
He's married,</v>

2211
02:09:16.140 --> 02:09:18.430
he's Marysville weirded out by this is it.

2212
02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:22.440
This is a bit the dolphins and little about something.
We figured it out.

2213
02:09:22.441 --> 02:09:27.390
Dolphins and sinkholes.
What about p?
There was a dolphin.

2214
02:09:27.391 --> 02:09:30.780
They become a werewolf.
Yeah.
What about all that?
What about syphilis?

2215
02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:35.160
You're being rude.
You're being rude by eliminating a lot of my fears.

2216
02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:39.500
Trying to categorize me as some sort of a normal meatheads showed they go,

2217
02:09:39.501 --> 02:09:43.070
why don't we do podcasts like this every day?
Also,
I think that we're capable,

2218
02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:47.660
<v 5>girl,
so my question of food versus Booz has been answered.
Thank you.</v>

2219
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:52.010
<v 4>Right?
I can take a cardboard sandwich with a good pause.</v>

2220
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:54.360
I have not tasted it.

2221
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:56.730
<v 8>Yeah,
beaten several times.</v>

2222
02:09:58.380 --> 02:10:00.630
I'm ready to kill a buffalo bitch.

2223
02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:04.880
I'm ready to go to Aubrey's hunting buffalo.
Yeah.

2224
02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:08.180
I need a lot of red meat,
man.
It's very important.
It's imperative to keep

2225
02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:11.080
<v 5>my fucking,
I thought the red meat was the inflammatory shit.</v>

2226
02:10:11.140 --> 02:10:13.610
<v 4>Not Sense the real show.</v>

2227
02:10:13.650 --> 02:10:16.420
It's the highest thing of cholesterol and the real issue is,
yeah.
Yeah.

2228
02:10:16.530 --> 02:10:20.670
<v 8>Brian,
what is that word?
Hey,
I'm trying to,
hey,</v>

2229
02:10:20.671 --> 02:10:23.640
I have to worry about you now.
You're getting ready to look.
The word Fart.

2230
02:10:23.670 --> 02:10:26.850
Monkey crashing.
Battle ropes,

2231
02:10:27.690 --> 02:10:31.740
real inflammation.
As far as animal tissue,

2232
02:10:31.770 --> 02:10:34.220
there's a lot of it.
It's been correlated

2233
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:38.010
<v 4>to cows eating corn.
My problem is I,
I love to eat.</v>

2234
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:42.470
I love eating food.
I love drinking.
Here's the problem with corn fed beef.

2235
02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:46.100
God Damn delicious.
Okay.
A Ribeye,

2236
02:10:46.101 --> 02:10:49.730
a solid silver mesquite charcoal.
You were talking,

2237
02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:52.430
you were talking about when you first saw vice and you're like,

2238
02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:54.320
I saw your to noble shit.
And I say

2239
02:10:54.610 --> 02:10:57.160
<v 5>the first Rogan podcast ever heard was,</v>

2240
02:10:57.580 --> 02:11:02.330
you know how much fucking shit it takes to make a skirt steak or strip steak

2241
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:04.210
strips that you were talking about strip steak.

2242
02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:06.040
And maybe it was Anthony Bourdain,

2243
02:11:06.041 --> 02:11:10.450
but he's somebody who knew you were talking about us as a strip steak and you

2244
02:11:10.451 --> 02:11:11.920
were saying this fucking steak.

2245
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:14.200
They take it out of the whole cow and this is the fucking thing.

2246
02:11:14.201 --> 02:11:17.140
And you put it on the Goddamn barbecue and you would never,

2247
02:11:17.590 --> 02:11:19.240
and I was sitting there and I was like,

2248
02:11:19.540 --> 02:11:22.140
why the fuck isn't he talking about a porterhouse?

2249
02:11:22.150 --> 02:11:25.450
Cause the porterhouse has the strip and the,
and the filet,

2250
02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:29.650
the bone with the bone.
So it's got the best of both worlds.

2251
02:11:29.651 --> 02:11:31.170
It's like a shemale like we were talking.

2252
02:11:32.170 --> 02:11:34.270
<v 4>It's got the,
it's got the filet and the,</v>

2253
02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:39.190
and the fucking on the fucking boat.
So anyways,

2254
02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:43.140
<v 5>first podcast I ever heard was talking about steak and that's when I,</v>

2255
02:11:43.570 --> 02:11:47.170
<v 4>was it Anthony.
Oh,
he fell in love and that's sweet.
I'm glad we're,
it's a mutual,</v>

2256
02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:50.690
I don't know how this feels like the marathon,
like three hour park

2257
02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:55.690
for Dean,
who's one of the first guys.
I was like,
I hope this guy likes me.

2258
02:11:56.050 --> 02:12:00.970
It would suck if I love him.
I love his shows.

2259
02:12:00.971 --> 02:12:05.920
I love what awesome and what he's done is awesome.
He's so,

2260
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:08.890
he's so honest about his intentions,

2261
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:13.420
but a guy who can take tape and fucking make it into what he did.
I said,

2262
02:12:13.421 --> 02:12:17.470
let me tell you something about how committed Anthony is to food.

2263
02:12:17.980 --> 02:12:22.660
He takes this drug so that he can still eat pork.

2264
02:12:23.230 --> 02:12:27.850
He takes some sort of was Lipitor or whatever.
The funny thing is,
some anti,
they,

2265
02:12:28.060 --> 02:12:30.640
they literally said to him,
you must change your diet.

2266
02:12:30.670 --> 02:12:34.540
You traveling all over the world,
you're eating cholesterol.
Exactly.

2267
02:12:34.630 --> 02:12:38.410
Cholesterol field,
fatty foods,
red wine,
red wine,

2268
02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:40.780
make it decide to make a decision.

2269
02:12:40.781 --> 02:12:45.280
It's either Lipitor or it's,
it's no fatty foods.

2270
02:12:45.430 --> 02:12:48.400
You either take this trace and liberatory takes the dry out.
Fuck,

2271
02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:51.610
he doesn't give up.
He's like,
I want the poor.

2272
02:12:53.250 --> 02:12:57.600
<v 5>Well,
pork,
well,
pork,
because if you go into any country,</v>

2273
02:12:57.900 --> 02:13:00.840
beef generally sucks.
America,
the beef is fantastic,

2274
02:13:00.841 --> 02:13:03.130
but generally it's sucks cause beef is,

2275
02:13:03.210 --> 02:13:06.840
it needs a lot of grass and lots of food and little water.

2276
02:13:07.110 --> 02:13:10.950
So beef in most countries is shit,
but pork,

2277
02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:14.430
like when you have pork from a third world country or,

2278
02:13:14.730 --> 02:13:19.220
or yet Yardbirds the best.
What's your impaired like a yard bird.

2279
02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:23.570
I call those.
Nevermind.
Like a bird that lives in the yard.
Is that a page?
No.

2280
02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:26.860
Chicken.
Chicken.
But they'll just like,
let's say you go to Jamaica,
right?

2281
02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:29.580
They have a yardbird.
They just go out and kill it.

2282
02:13:29.640 --> 02:13:32.070
They take it and they cover it and,
and the barbecue the

2283
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:34.770
<v 3>fuck out of it.
Not Jerked.
Everyone always talks about church again.</v>

2284
02:13:34.771 --> 02:13:38.580
It's fucking barbecue chicken in Germany.
And it's the best fucking thing ever.

2285
02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:41.700
Why?
Because it's the yardbird,
it's just been eating the fucking shit,
whatever.

2286
02:13:41.850 --> 02:13:43.230
Same thing when you go anywhere else,

2287
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:48.200
<v 1>people don't realize that like you can take like your scraps of your tables.</v>

2288
02:13:48.201 --> 02:13:51.440
Scraps the same report.
Yeah.
If you had a bunch of chickens,

2289
02:13:51.441 --> 02:13:54.780
you can throw them in the backyard and they can like live right.

2290
02:13:54.781 --> 02:13:57.380
Well or Apps,
Yardbirds,

2291
02:13:57.490 --> 02:14:00.700
<v 3>the most delicious motherfuckers you'll ever have in your fucking life.</v>

2292
02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:05.020
What we have here is some Purdue genetically modified bullshit,

2293
02:14:05.470 --> 02:14:07.840
but if you ever have a yardbird just from anywhere,

2294
02:14:07.841 --> 02:14:10.750
like they're just wrote just to relive it or put it on a grill,

2295
02:14:10.751 --> 02:14:13.600
do whatever the fuck.
It's the best.
You know,
you sit there and you go,

2296
02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:14.860
what the fuck am I eating?

2297
02:14:14.910 --> 02:14:17.760
<v 1>This is the best thing ever asked you this because I have,</v>

2298
02:14:17.850 --> 02:14:22.850
I have two inclinations and one inclination is to be in the woods on the top of

2299
02:14:24.781 --> 02:14:28.680
a mountain,
the well and experiencing nature.

2300
02:14:28.890 --> 02:14:31.860
And the other inclination is to be in the hive,

2301
02:14:31.890 --> 02:14:36.890
to be deep inside of Manhattan on 20 well bubble world,

2302
02:14:37.290 --> 02:14:40.860
all street in the middle of or of under mountain guy.

2303
02:14:40.861 --> 02:14:45.030
The yes and no.
It's like I don't know what w.

2304
02:14:45.230 --> 02:14:48.330
W w w where's the gravity coming from?

2305
02:14:48.331 --> 02:14:50.970
Is it coming from the masses of humanity,

2306
02:14:51.660 --> 02:14:56.660
although imperfect at the moment might be trying harder to work shit out or is

2307
02:14:57.991 --> 02:15:02.991
it from this sort of reluctant agreement that the earth is much more powerful

2308
02:15:05.341 --> 02:15:07.040
than the culture at this point in time?

2309
02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:10.320
It's better to just isolate yourself from all these idiots who haven't gotten

2310
02:15:10.321 --> 02:15:13.100
the information yet and get your own water from a hole in there.

2311
02:15:13.430 --> 02:15:15.710
<v 3>I think you know,
again,</v>

2312
02:15:16.930 --> 02:15:19.460
maybe the quintessential question of the modern age.

2313
02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:23.780
<v 1>So you're,
you're in both spots.
Yeah.
Cause you're in a guy live in Manhattan,</v>

2314
02:15:23.781 --> 02:15:28.320
you have children yet.
So you're on that next level of sensitivity.
I

2315
02:15:28.470 --> 02:15:32.300
<v 3>spend a majority of my time out there and the shit,
and I will tell you this,</v>

2316
02:15:32.660 --> 02:15:36.230
when you actually have something like for example,
like you said,

2317
02:15:36.231 --> 02:15:39.560
if you kill a deer and you,
you,
you,
you cook that on an open fire,

2318
02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:42.680
nothing tastes better than that.
You're right.
However,

2319
02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:46.550
the thing is is this might be my paranoia.

2320
02:15:46.580 --> 02:15:49.430
You got your sinkholes in your werewolves.
My,

2321
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:53.420
what I think is happening is there's,
there's a global restructuring happening.

2322
02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:56.990
Yeah,
there is.
There is a global restructuring happening that people are seeing.

2323
02:15:56.991 --> 02:16:01.040
They're calling the greatest recession since the depression.
There were saying,

2324
02:16:01.041 --> 02:16:04.250
well this is this and this is that.
I think this is the new normal.

2325
02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:08.090
So to be honest,
and I'm not necessarily proud of this,

2326
02:16:08.570 --> 02:16:12.680
what I love about New York City is I kind of feel like neuro is,

2327
02:16:12.681 --> 02:16:16.550
Rome is burning because I believe New York City is the greatest city in the

2328
02:16:16.551 --> 02:16:20.300
world.
I believe it's the capital of the world culturally and economically and

2329
02:16:20.301 --> 02:16:25.130
politically for that matter.
And you know when you go out in New York City,

2330
02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:26.690
you know,

2331
02:16:26.690 --> 02:16:30.020
it has the best restaurants in the world as the best nightlife in New Orleans,

2332
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:32.560
<v 5>as has the best.
I believe it has the best everything in the world.</v>

2333
02:16:32.561 --> 02:16:34.660
I'm a huge fan of New York City.
I'm not from New York,

2334
02:16:36.030 --> 02:16:40.420
<v 4>New York.
So I say wrong.
Well it does and so you can fuck up.</v>

2335
02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:44.320
But what I will say,
what I will say is when you,

2336
02:16:44.410 --> 02:16:48.100
<v 5>when you go out in New York City right now,
today,</v>

2337
02:16:48.310 --> 02:16:50.460
and it might be Shanghai in 10 years,
whatever,

2338
02:16:50.470 --> 02:16:55.470
but today New York is the global capital and you can go out in New York City and

2339
02:16:56.291 --> 02:17:00.730
you can like me come as a penniless immigrant and become a fucking rich

2340
02:17:00.731 --> 02:17:03.610
motherfucker who can go out and have the greatest food.
And by the way,

2341
02:17:03.611 --> 02:17:07.840
that food can be like a dollar spring off the Vietnamese bice or the best steak

2342
02:17:07.841 --> 02:17:11.920
at Peter Luger's,
whatever the fuck it is.
New York,
Peter,
Look New New York.

2343
02:17:11.921 --> 02:17:16.480
We'll give you everything.
New York has everything.
It's fantastic.

2344
02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:18.020
<v 4>God Damn it,
I'm moving to New York.</v>

2345
02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:25.150
But we got blue cross blue shield.
But where,

2346
02:17:25.880 --> 02:17:29.720
where are we going?
Where are we going underground to a locker?

2347
02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:31.340
Where are we

2348
02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:35.000
<v 5>going is and where do I feel the happiest is?</v>

2349
02:17:35.330 --> 02:17:39.290
I feel the happiest out in nature.
I feel the happiest at sea.

2350
02:17:39.470 --> 02:17:41.060
I feel the happiest in the forest.

2351
02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:44.600
I feel the happiest grilling meat over a grill.
You know,

2352
02:17:44.770 --> 02:17:47.200
<v 4>all this shit bring Manhattan.
But the forest.</v>

2353
02:17:47.201 --> 02:17:49.220
But what I will tell you is I don't,

2354
02:17:49.260 --> 02:17:50.700
<v 5>I believe that the,</v>

2355
02:17:50.940 --> 02:17:55.940
that the sort of Roman back in alien craziness that is New York today is going

2356
02:17:56.491 --> 02:18:00.690
to be around that much longer.
I'm unpacking the alien.
Well,
Roman,

2357
02:18:00.691 --> 02:18:05.040
like the end of Rome,
the Roman Empire and back in alien,
Bacchus,
the sort of uh,

2358
02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:07.760
the god of wine and drink and party.

2359
02:18:07.830 --> 02:18:10.680
<v 4>How obscure your references,
sorry.</v>

2360
02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:16.770
Shel Silverstein Times
God of booze.

2361
02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:20.070
How do you know about these people?
I read books,
Bitch.
Okay.

2362
02:18:20.071 --> 02:18:23.280
I understand this back in Anglian it means boozy.

2363
02:18:24.860 --> 02:18:29.860
It's been three times during this podcast at the mag safe electrical cord

2364
02:18:30.871 --> 02:18:35.280
connecting to my laptop has dropped off through my flailing hand.

2365
02:18:36.210 --> 02:18:38.640
That means it took Gooden.
Dude,

2366
02:18:38.641 --> 02:18:41.700
you have a battery and last three hours you don't have to work.
No,
no,
no.

2367
02:18:41.701 --> 02:18:46.170
I'm upset with apple.
Why this?
It's 100%.

2368
02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:51.200
They changed their charges all the time.
Stop playing games.
Okay.

2369
02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:54.750
Finally at 45 years of age.

2370
02:18:54.751 --> 02:18:59.490
I'm a part of a national company that sells things and one of the things that I

2371
02:18:59.491 --> 02:19:04.170
realize is you can decide to make more money.
You fucks.

2372
02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:05.073
Are you paying?

2373
02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:09.880
<v 5>No,
no,
but hey,
ice tea,
iced tea.</v>

2374
02:19:09.881 --> 02:19:10.714
The wrapper.

2375
02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:13.900
<v 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2376
02:19:14.570 --> 02:19:19.120
You meant to say we never came up with the Olive Olive Garden Garden.
Yeah.

2377
02:19:19.700 --> 02:19:24.700
Just keep the camera off my man as he meditates into a trance,

2378
02:19:25.911 --> 02:19:27.260
a trance

2379
02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:33.120
<v 8>snap one off a transcendental meditation point where he understands the point of</v>

2380
02:19:34.371 --> 02:19:36.890
view that he is in right now.

2381
02:19:37.210 --> 02:19:42.210
<v 10>Well not represent where he will be in infinity is if he is in fact a soul and</v>

2382
02:19:45.611 --> 02:19:50.611
if a soul trends grasses from one point in history to another over and over and

2383
02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:56.240
over

2384
02:19:56.240 --> 02:20:00.860
<v 8>for until you get it right.
Now that sounds like hippie bullshit,</v>

2385
02:20:00.861 --> 02:20:05.790
but do you understand that Helio Gracie believes in this Helio Gracie,

2386
02:20:05.791 --> 02:20:09.050
you said something once.
If you don't know who he is,
his real name,

2387
02:20:09.051 --> 02:20:10.640
he is in Helio Gracie.

2388
02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:15.080
I say that for all you white people who don't understand how Brazilian people

2389
02:20:15.081 --> 02:20:19.760
pronounce things,
but they pronounce the,
for whatever reason,

2390
02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:25.100
Helio Gracie,
h e l I o was pronounced Ilial Gracie.

2391
02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:29.810
That's how the Portuguese in Brazil use that.
That word,
Helio Gracie,

2392
02:20:30.350 --> 02:20:35.350
he said something once and he's the guy who trained Hixon Gracie and hoists

2393
02:20:36.021 --> 02:20:36.501
Gracie,

2394
02:20:36.501 --> 02:20:41.360
the original winner of the UFC and the UFC too.

2395
02:20:41.361 --> 02:20:45.260
I mean hoists Gracie change the entire face of mark.

2396
02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:48.610
<v 5>Wasn't he the dude who also said,
I'll take on all comers,</v>

2397
02:20:48.611 --> 02:20:50.910
all weight classes and we'll,
we'll,

2398
02:20:50.930 --> 02:20:55.210
we'll pay 10 or a hundred grand or whatever the number changes,
but he said,

2399
02:20:55.211 --> 02:20:57.880
I'll take on any fighter,
any weight class and I'll fight them.

2400
02:20:57.910 --> 02:20:59.800
Not only did Elliot Gracie

2401
02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:04.060
<v 6>do this,
he did this when he was 140 plus pounds,</v>

2402
02:21:04.061 --> 02:21:09.061
yet he was like one 45 he developed a method of using leverage and using

2403
02:21:10.661 --> 02:21:14.590
techniques to submit guys that were much,
much,

2404
02:21:14.591 --> 02:21:16.930
much larger than you.
Okay.

2405
02:21:16.931 --> 02:21:20.260
He trained Hickson and trained hallways.

2406
02:21:20.470 --> 02:21:25.420
He trained some of the most influential martial artists in the history of the

2407
02:21:25.421 --> 02:21:27.370
world.
One of the things he said,
hold on a second.

2408
02:21:27.610 --> 02:21:32.610
One of the things he said is that you live this life and if you make even one

2409
02:21:33.101 --> 02:21:36.310
mistake and you live this life incorrectly,

2410
02:21:36.490 --> 02:21:41.490
you will return and you will do it all over again until you get it right and

2411
02:21:42.221 --> 02:21:45.480
that sounds crazy.
I heard about that and I was like,

2412
02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:49.160
<v 8>Oh,
you motherfucker,
why you put on that bullshit on me?</v>

2413
02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:53.210
There's no way anybody's ever going to live this life perfectly and get it.

2414
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:55.390
And then I thought,
if anybody

2415
02:21:55.510 --> 02:21:56.343
<v 6>knows,</v>

2416
02:21:57.280 --> 02:22:02.280
if anybody understands the path of man in its truest form without,

2417
02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:04.680
<v 2>okay,</v>

2418
02:22:04.680 --> 02:22:08.010
<v 6>without hyperbole,
without</v>

2419
02:22:09.050 --> 02:22:09.883
<v 2>d,</v>

2420
02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:16.940
<v 6>directing other people's insecurities back on different folks to alleviate the</v>

2421
02:22:18.391 --> 02:22:21.600
pressure of reality.
If anybody's going to understand who,

2422
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:23.520
what the fuck is really going on,

2423
02:22:23.521 --> 02:22:28.521
it's going to be 140 pound man who's willing to take on the greatest fighter.

2424
02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:32.470
<v 3>Any but any fighter,
any fight or anything</v>

2425
02:22:32.470 --> 02:22:37.030
<v 4>style,
any weight,
any weight,
any fucking wait,
that's insane.</v>

2426
02:22:37.031 --> 02:22:37.864
Kamora

2427
02:22:38.140 --> 02:22:42.840
<v 6>his arm with a Kimora we'd come on.
It's a shoulder lock.</v>

2428
02:22:42.841 --> 02:22:46.800
It's the catch wrestling guys call it a double restaurant.
A double wrist lock.

2429
02:22:47.190 --> 02:22:51.480
But this technique became known as a Kamar.
He broke his arm.

2430
02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:54.440
Illia wouldn't tap out.
He let him break his arm.

2431
02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:58.360
<v 3>Did you ever see the thing I did,
I went down to,
uh,</v>

2432
02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:02.350
Sao Paulo and Rio.
Um,
and I hung out with the grace.

2433
02:23:02.351 --> 02:23:05.020
He's in a hung out with the fighters down there in the valley to though guys,

2434
02:23:05.770 --> 02:23:09.350
they are the fucking toughest dudes in the fucking world.
The,

2435
02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:13.300
the Valley Tudo guys are fucking,
uh,
no,
it's a crazy way to live.
Now.

2436
02:23:13.301 --> 02:23:15.870
They're all fighting MMA.
They're all funding UFC.
Well,
they,

2437
02:23:15.871 --> 02:23:19.870
they do that now because they realized there's prosperity in that they can,

2438
02:23:19.871 --> 02:23:22.690
they can get out of the,
uh,
of the favelas,

2439
02:23:23.050 --> 02:23:26.850
but they are the toughest motherfuckers alive down.
Yes.

2440
02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:31.570
One of the most beautiful things about what Leo said,

2441
02:23:31.571 --> 02:23:34.090
what Helio Gracie said when he said that

2442
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:37.440
<v 6>he would like that,</v>

2443
02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:42.520
that he literally had sort of figured out a way to test who you are and task

2444
02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:48.300
what you could figure out and test what you could do.

2445
02:23:48.810 --> 02:23:53.810
And he truly believed in these most extreme of circumstances,

2446
02:23:54.570 --> 02:23:57.210
literally fighting these much larger,

2447
02:23:57.211 --> 02:24:00.210
much stronger man and letting them break his arms.

2448
02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:03.780
He believe that if you live this life,

2449
02:24:04.140 --> 02:24:08.850
that you must do it correctly.
And if you did anything wrong,

2450
02:24:09.090 --> 02:24:14.090
anything contrary to your spirit or contrary to the,

2451
02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:14.820
the,

2452
02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:19.820
the sole or the collective idea of humanity as whole being of the utmost

2453
02:24:21.451 --> 02:24:23.100
importance.
So you,

2454
02:24:23.101 --> 02:24:26.580
the one who is tested must represent humanity.

2455
02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:31.390
And in that saying that if you made any mistakes,

2456
02:24:31.391 --> 02:24:34.330
she would do it again.
I was so scared when I,

2457
02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:36.130
<v 4>when I,
when I read that,
I was like,</v>

2458
02:24:36.131 --> 02:24:39.190
that might be the one of the most frightening things I've ever read by life.

2459
02:24:39.310 --> 02:24:40.770
Cause he might be right.
Right.

2460
02:24:40.810 --> 02:24:45.400
What does that guy in his battles literally almost to the death.

2461
02:24:45.580 --> 02:24:49.830
I mean he was fighting anybody modern day commit to a bloodsport.

2462
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:53.470
That's a small man.
Exactly.
And he kicked the fuck out of everybody.

2463
02:24:53.471 --> 02:24:56.650
I weigh 190 pounds.
That means this guy,

2464
02:24:57.070 --> 02:25:00.130
he was 145 pounds

2465
02:25:01.810 --> 02:25:06.070
and he would take any five pounds more than me.
That's an,
it's less than me.

2466
02:25:06.190 --> 02:25:08.830
That's an insane amount of weight.
And this guy would take,

2467
02:25:08.831 --> 02:25:12.720
and I wouldn't take on anybody in the world.
He would take on big,
giant people,

2468
02:25:12.721 --> 02:25:13.160
people.

2469
02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:16.010
<v 6>And in throwing himself into the fire,</v>

2470
02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:21.250
he had an understanding of human life and of human nature.

2471
02:25:22.340 --> 02:25:24.100
And he,
he sort

2472
02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:28.760
<v 5>of in some way relayed that to said,
can I give a shout out and can I tell you,</v>

2473
02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:33.560
<v 11>are you giving a shout?
Are you a black guy or a white rapper?</v>

2474
02:25:33.730 --> 02:25:35.480
<v 5>Can I give a shit is happening here?</v>

2475
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:38.360
I would like to give a shout out to one guy who I met.

2476
02:25:38.780 --> 02:25:41.030
He's a guy named Matt Ruskin,
right?

2477
02:25:41.270 --> 02:25:45.310
And he was in the marines in Iraq and they had these fight clubs in,

2478
02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:49.180
in Iraq and they would,
the marines,
they were for like forced week on these,

2479
02:25:49.210 --> 02:25:53.060
these were tough motherfucker.
And he was doing this,
uh,

2480
02:25:53.120 --> 02:25:56.240
they'd had these fight clubs and they would fight the fuck out of each other.

2481
02:25:56.690 --> 02:26:00.230
And he,
he's like 200 pounds.
And he would fight,
guys were two 50.

2482
02:26:00.231 --> 02:26:02.660
He would fight guys or one 50.
He was fighting.
And he would beat them all.

2483
02:26:03.050 --> 02:26:05.330
And he came back and he started doing MMA.

2484
02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:08.930
He started fighting him and me and he hooked up with this guy,
uh,

2485
02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:13.510
one of the Gracies and,
and you're taught him Brazilian Jujitsu,

2486
02:26:13.610 --> 02:26:18.470
of which he was I believe,
five time world champion.
Uh,

2487
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:23.570
the Gracie,
which God,
I'm forgetting his fucking name.
He's fucking amazing.

2488
02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:26.630
He is amazing guy.
Yeah,
he's a Gracie.

2489
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:30.860
And I went down to visit Gracie.
Well wait,

2490
02:26:30.861 --> 02:26:34.180
is he a compete at heavyweight heavyweight?
He was heavy.

2491
02:26:34.181 --> 02:26:39.181
We was five time world Brazilian Jujitsu champion and a hodge,

2492
02:26:41.150 --> 02:26:45.140
not quite a heavyweight.
He competes in MMA at one 85.

2493
02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:47.390
I don't think he fights anymore,
but he was,
he was,

2494
02:26:47.391 --> 02:26:51.500
he was a Brazilian Jujitsu champion five times.
Okay.
Global champion.
Anyway,

2495
02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:54.620
Matt Ruskin hooked me up with this guy we went down to,

2496
02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:58.380
to remember his name at all.
See Gracie,

2497
02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:03.830
that's a problem.
Got.
But,
but he's a,
he's a big,

2498
02:27:03.831 --> 02:27:07.640
big fucking heavyweight heavyweight.
Yeah.
Heavyweight grains.
Yeah.

2499
02:27:07.970 --> 02:27:12.350
I went down,
if you can look it up.
I went down with them on,
uh,
you know,

2500
02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:15.590
to Echo,
shout out to heavyweight Gracie,
shout out,

2501
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:20.930
but I gotta say this,
Matt Ruskin,
the marine fought in Iraq,
came back,

2502
02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:23.240
started fighting with the Gracies,
took me down there,

2503
02:27:23.241 --> 02:27:26.560
show me what the fuck was going on.
And I've got to say,
you know,

2504
02:27:26.570 --> 02:27:31.570
I learned the story of the Gracies from the Gracies when I was down there and

2505
02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:34.010
that story of,
you know,

2506
02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:38.990
Brazilian Jujitsu and him sort of taken on all commerce,
uh,

2507
02:27:39.020 --> 02:27:42.560
with,
with the bounty.
Uh,
you know,
like if you,
if you can beat me,

2508
02:27:44.060 --> 02:27:45.500
when I heard it was 1 million bucks,

2509
02:27:45.501 --> 02:27:47.270
but I think it was actually more like a hundred grand.

2510
02:27:48.740 --> 02:27:53.660
This is in like the 70s and eighties.
This is like the Valley Tuto Times.

2511
02:27:53.661 --> 02:27:56.810
Wait a minute.
A heavyweight Gracie from back then.
Oh No,
now,

2512
02:27:56.811 --> 02:28:01.710
then the Gracie that brought me down,
she,
I'm going to get no hoe.

2513
02:28:01.730 --> 02:28:06.210
Hollis Gracie's very famous,
but well,
Hollis,
the son of holes,
right?

2514
02:28:06.650 --> 02:28:11.510
It's a great,
I'm going to get in shit for forgetting his name.
That's okay.

2515
02:28:11.511 --> 02:28:15.140
Think about it for a real good looking guy.
He was a model.

2516
02:28:15.470 --> 02:28:17.210
Real good looking guy.

2517
02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:22.070
Hickson Hickson is the most handsome of all time and the of all,
this guy was

2518
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:26.870
<v 4>actually a model in Brazil.
I'm not gay.
And Matt Ruskin,
if you can,</v>

2519
02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:30.560
if you could tweet me his name.
He was a model.
Yeah,

2520
02:28:30.561 --> 02:28:33.330
model and a great idea and got your pants

2521
02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.570
and five time global.
Two champions.

2522
02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:42.500
We are now in a swamp of disinformation.
No,
it's true.

2523
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:47.420
No wick PDI.
If someone could tweet us right now,
we don't have a great show.

2524
02:28:47.421 --> 02:28:50.730
Hung out.
Let,
let me tell you something.
I'm going to look at my phone.

2525
02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:53.600
I'm at Ruskin.
Email me his name.

2526
02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:56.270
I'm sure Matt Ruskin is probably got a good

2527
02:28:56.360 --> 02:28:58.110
<v 1>gator roll and maybe an animal</v>

2528
02:28:58.190 --> 02:29:02.840
<v 4>kind of choke or victor,
victor,</v>

2529
02:29:03.350 --> 02:29:04.920
victor,
good half guard.

2530
02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:08.400
He shaves and this guy was more of a Jujitsu straight up.

2531
02:29:08.460 --> 02:29:09.420
Let me explain something.

2532
02:29:09.690 --> 02:29:11.700
<v 1>Okay.
First of all,
no bullshit.</v>

2533
02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:12.440
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

2534
02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:17.440
<v 1>I've been doing Jujitsu since 1998 and I've never heard of a Gracie heavyweight.</v>

2535
02:29:18.580 --> 02:29:20.710
<v 4>He seems like he's a way.</v>

2536
02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:25.630
He's a heavyweight who won world Jujitsu.
Oh,

2537
02:29:25.631 --> 02:29:26.590
championship.

2538
02:29:27.090 --> 02:29:27.400
<v 2>Okay,</v>

2539
02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:28.570
<v 1>I understand.
Okay,</v>

2540
02:29:28.670 --> 02:29:29.970
<v 8>got it.
Great.</v>

2541
02:29:30.140 --> 02:29:34.530
<v 1>See in MMA,
who was a man?
He's,
he beat Bob Sapp.</v>

2542
02:29:34.531 --> 02:29:38.640
I think he's,
uh,
he fought in the UFC once he lost,

2543
02:29:38.641 --> 02:29:43.220
but I think it was more of a case of,
uh,
when they,
when,

2544
02:29:43.290 --> 02:29:46.920
when a guy immediately gets thrown into the UFC,

2545
02:29:46.921 --> 02:29:48.370
there's a thing that happens causing it.

2546
02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:52.530
They called an adrenaline dump where you get in front of,
uh,
the,

2547
02:29:52.531 --> 02:29:55.320
the big cameras and you think about the hoists,

2548
02:29:55.321 --> 02:29:58.680
Gracie fights of 1993 and you panic.

2549
02:29:58.860 --> 02:30:03.330
It's like the overwhelming input of the,
the,
the,

2550
02:30:03.331 --> 02:30:05.160
the moment is,
it's too much.

2551
02:30:05.650 --> 02:30:10.120
<v 4>Matt,
how are you?
I'm here with Joe Rogan.</v>

2552
02:30:10.121 --> 02:30:13.600
We're talking about the Gracies.
Let me talk to this and I'm saying,

2553
02:30:13.660 --> 02:30:18.130
who's the crazy?
Daniel Gracie.
Daniel.
Daniel Gracie.

2554
02:30:18.210 --> 02:30:20.740
World's Jujitsu champion.
How many times?
Three times.

2555
02:30:24.590 --> 02:30:28.650
Yeah.
So He's,
he's a global,
a Jujitsu champion.
Uh,

2556
02:30:28.730 --> 02:30:31.970
Daniel Gracie,
I want,
I'm going to put you on the Rogan and hold on a second.

2557
02:30:32.570 --> 02:30:33.403
Talk to him.

2558
02:30:33.640 --> 02:30:33.950
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2559
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:37.250
<v 4>By the way,
Matt Roskins a fucking awesome dude.
And Matt,</v>

2560
02:30:40.260 --> 02:30:41.130
<v 1>can you hear him?
Yeah.</v>

2561
02:30:41.810 --> 02:30:42.760
<v 8>Ah,
what's up Matt?</v>

2562
02:30:44.340 --> 02:30:48.330
How do you know powerful Shane Smith from vice.com?

2563
02:30:59.110 --> 02:31:03.340
How rude.
Cause first of all,
how rude.
How bout,
how bout hey,

2564
02:31:03.460 --> 02:31:04.690
settle down.
First of all,

2565
02:31:04.691 --> 02:31:07.150
how about you tell him first and foremost that you love them.

2566
02:31:07.360 --> 02:31:11.050
You don't have to go right into your,
you're a fat fuck and you're going to die.

2567
02:31:12.250 --> 02:31:16.450
He knows how much you love him.
You say that,
but is that touch alleviate the,

2568
02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:17.293
okay.

2569
02:31:19.050 --> 02:31:20.520
<v 4>Oh,
no.
Gay stuff.</v>

2570
02:31:20.610 --> 02:31:22.500
<v 1>This is a late date podcast.</v>

2571
02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:26.550
There's a lot of dudes that are listening to this in the shower.
I'm sorry.

2572
02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:27.413
Keep going

2573
02:31:27.810 --> 02:31:28.643
<v 0>Matt.</v>

2574
02:31:29.650 --> 02:31:32.030
<v 12>So he knows how much I love known to let him fool you.</v>

2575
02:31:32.170 --> 02:31:35.960
<v 1>No gay stuff,
Bro.
We're late night.</v>

2576
02:31:37.210 --> 02:31:39.580
<v 12>So we just became friends after that.</v>

2577
02:31:39.890 --> 02:31:44.350
I did some work with the mid rise before,
before five land.

2578
02:31:44.351 --> 02:31:48.470
They did this whole thing of me when I was training for one of my fries.
Uh,

2579
02:31:48.490 --> 02:31:53.030
they said that their friend Thomas around with you for a while.
Um,

2580
02:31:53.460 --> 02:31:57.740
<v 5>but we went tell him about when we went down with Daniel Gracie.
Yeah.</v>

2581
02:31:59.290 --> 02:32:01.540
<v 12>Jordan to a weapons bizarre with them.</v>

2582
02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:02.800
<v 1>Daniel Gracie.</v>

2583
02:32:04.770 --> 02:32:06.900
<v 12>Yeah.
For those with uh,
with Daniel.</v>

2584
02:32:07.230 --> 02:32:11.490
<v 1>Here's the thing about Daniel Gracie.
Daniel Gracie is a very,
very,</v>

2585
02:32:11.491 --> 02:32:15.180
very talented Brazilian Jujitsu fighter.
But his real last name,

2586
02:32:15.210 --> 02:32:19.170
I don't believe was it initially Gracie,
I think he sort of

2587
02:32:20.220 --> 02:32:21.120
<v 12>those cousins,</v>

2588
02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:25.580
<v 1>his hands,
his cousin.
Yeah.
And I think his,
his,
his mom's name is Gracie,</v>

2589
02:32:25.581 --> 02:32:28.610
but his dad's name and his birth name was not Gracie.
Right.

2590
02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:32.413
<v 12>Vieira</v>

2591
02:32:32.540 --> 02:32:37.520
<v 1>yeah,
I
escape,
I believe this is what I believe.</v>

2592
02:32:37.521 --> 02:32:42.320
I believe he's a very talented fighter but I believe this whole idea of

2593
02:32:42.321 --> 02:32:47.321
connecting yourself to the word Gracie is it is ultimately very self defeating.

2594
02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:52.280
And,
and when a guy does that,
I almost want to pull them aside.
If it was Daniel,

2595
02:32:52.281 --> 02:32:54.980
you're a bad mother fucker or whatever the fuck your last name is.

2596
02:32:54.981 --> 02:32:57.340
It doesn't matter.
You know,
you need to get your,

2597
02:32:57.341 --> 02:33:00.710
your head wrapped around the fact that that's all bullshit.

2598
02:33:00.740 --> 02:33:05.740
Gracie is a great name but it's 2013 and when he was competing eight,

2599
02:33:07.131 --> 02:33:11.690
nine,
10,
whatever the fuck it was,
2008,
it doesn't matter.

2600
02:33:11.691 --> 02:33:15.710
What matters is how good you are and adopting the name.

2601
02:33:15.711 --> 02:33:18.560
Gracie almost makes people think like,

2602
02:33:18.770 --> 02:33:22.970
oh well this guy is trying to get a little extra attention for for no reason.

2603
02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:25.980
The,
the,
the,
the world championships in the world championship.

2604
02:33:25.981 --> 02:33:30.380
So you either mounted guy who take us back,
you tap them,
whatever you do,

2605
02:33:30.381 --> 02:33:32.090
you either do or you don't do.

2606
02:33:32.091 --> 02:33:36.110
And it doesn't matter if your name is Marcello Garcia who's unbelievably

2607
02:33:36.111 --> 02:33:36.944
respected.

2608
02:33:37.100 --> 02:33:42.100
I mean Marcel Garcia is the top of the pyramid when it comes to Brazilian

2609
02:33:42.171 --> 02:33:46.490
Jujitsu in the world today in 2013 or Gracie,
it doesn't matter.

2610
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:49.130
So whatever his name was,
what was his real name?

2611
02:33:50.760 --> 02:33:54.720
<v 12>I think the family name is smallest ones.
And one of the two.</v>

2612
02:33:54.940 --> 02:33:57.010
<v 1>Matt,
how many times you've been hiring in your life?
Don't lie to me.</v>

2613
02:33:58.020 --> 02:34:00.430
How many times have you been hiding in your life?

2614
02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:01.760
<v 0>Okay,</v>

2615
02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:04.880
<v 1>more than 10 is it more than 10</v>

2616
02:34:05.760 --> 02:34:06.250
<v 0>okay.</v>

2617
02:34:06.250 --> 02:34:10.000
<v 1>Yes.
Okay,
so we could probably go camping together.</v>

2618
02:34:10.120 --> 02:34:13.270
How many times you ate and pot brownies and thought about chicks you fingered

2619
02:34:13.271 --> 02:34:18.160
when you were 14 you were really upset.
Like Kira Gate.
Gracie more

2620
02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:20.980
<v 8>than 10 that's why I love talking to you Matt.</v>

2621
02:34:22.300 --> 02:34:26.680
Let's keep it together Matt.
But there was a few guys that did that.
Uh,

2622
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:28.480
the Gracie thing where they use,

2623
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:32.770
<v 5>what I'm going to say is Daniel Gracie's,
but that might want to go,</v>

2624
02:34:32.890 --> 02:34:35.260
what am I going to say?
He's a bad motherfucker.
But by the way,

2625
02:34:35.410 --> 02:34:38.620
he took us around Brazil.
He took us to the valley.
Tudo Jim's.

2626
02:34:38.621 --> 02:34:43.540
He took us to the gyms.
He took us with Matt and I got to say it was fucking,

2627
02:34:43.570 --> 02:34:47.080
I got to say,
you see a different level of shit down there.

2628
02:34:47.110 --> 02:34:50.090
Then you will see anywhere else they did these guys train like motherfuckers.

2629
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:52.640
<v 8>Do you hear this mat and do you agree with this?</v>

2630
02:34:53.490 --> 02:34:53.760
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2631
02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:57.770
<v 12>Yeah.
The craziest thing,
I was in the Marine Corps that I lack in oh four,</v>

2632
02:34:58.670 --> 02:35:02.720
we all walked into the favela and we were in the complex at all and now,

2633
02:35:02.721 --> 02:35:04.760
which is at the time was like the worst of the worst.

2634
02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:09.930
And we had to grow as the boss if we could come in here and film.

2635
02:35:11.020 --> 02:35:12.830
So the boss or he has no problem.

2636
02:35:12.831 --> 02:35:17.120
Just don't tell him the kids with the guns and we're looking around and we're

2637
02:35:17.121 --> 02:35:19.990
like,
what kids,
what guns?
We take a clog,

2638
02:35:20.210 --> 02:35:25.210
a left turn down the street and I mean it was just wall to wall.

2639
02:35:26.210 --> 02:35:29.900
14 year olds,
15 year olds with like military grade weapons.

2640
02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:35.510
I mean you got a picture of the book,
it was like one word,
shorts,
flip flops,

2641
02:35:36.110 --> 02:35:40.730
you know like a 1989 Luther Campbell like gold rope chamber,
the medallion,

2642
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:45.810
you know,
mouth to mouth or side to side now cold,
he's fucking you know,

2643
02:35:46.010 --> 02:35:50.360
collapsible stock and forwarded a cog grenade launcher the whole nine.

2644
02:35:50.361 --> 02:35:55.361
I mean these kids were armed to the fucking cheat and everyone that we went down

2645
02:35:56.241 --> 02:35:59.390
there with was just looking around like whole Lee shit.

2646
02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:11.620
<v 8>You can never end a story by saying like Holy Shit,</v>

2647
02:36:13.430 --> 02:36:16.370
I am a very good story.

2648
02:36:16.430 --> 02:36:19.550
I was with however you leave us can say this.

2649
02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:23.240
Can you give us the respect of a v M

2650
02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:27.710
<v 5>I was,
I was with Matt on that and there was,
there was 14 year old kids</v>

2651
02:36:28.530 --> 02:36:32.440
<v 12>cause it was all a blur cause like I said probably was riding from like,</v>

2652
02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:33.870
you know,
one of the 11 times,

2653
02:36:34.070 --> 02:36:35.960
<v 8>don't lie to me Matt say yes.</v>

2654
02:36:37.500 --> 02:36:38.333
<v 12>Yes.</v>

2655
02:36:38.410 --> 02:36:42.460
<v 8>Okay.
Listen Bro,
I feel what you're saying.
And I was only fucking around.</v>

2656
02:36:42.580 --> 02:36:47.580
I was filling some dead space where we're trying to recalibrate our reality duty

2657
02:36:47.601 --> 02:36:51.850
or circumstances and your story being paradigm shifting.

2658
02:36:52.740 --> 02:36:56.700
Fuck them.
I'm not that fucked up.
Listen,
I want to tell you Matt,

2659
02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:00.090
<v 5>man,
I'm giving you a shout out.
I love you.</v>

2660
02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:04.650
This guy fucking is an awesome guy.
Ex Marine and a fighter.

2661
02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:06.220
I love you Matt Mad.

2662
02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:09.340
<v 8>I'm very sorry that you got dragged into a podcast.</v>

2663
02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:15.100
It was just a phone call for you and all of a sudden Shane Smith talking about

2664
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:20.010
some crazy shit and you're like,
God dammit,
I gotta tell the truth because

2665
02:37:20.230 --> 02:37:24.310
<v 4>Matt,
but,
but,
but then you had Ruskin and I don't give a fuck.</v>

2666
02:37:24.370 --> 02:37:27.820
But then your Gracie is a bad ass mother fucker.
Unquestionably,

2667
02:37:28.080 --> 02:37:29.620
but was his real name Matt,

2668
02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:34.100
<v 8>Daniel Gracie,
what is his real name?</v>

2669
02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:41.970
And I completely,
by the way,

2670
02:37:41.971 --> 02:37:45.720
I want to let everybody know is no judgment involved in that whatsoever.

2671
02:37:45.721 --> 02:37:50.721
I completely understand why someone who especially was in a situation where

2672
02:37:51.180 --> 02:37:54.870
there were a very talented guy and they were trying to maximize the,

2673
02:37:55.170 --> 02:37:56.290
the sort of the,

2674
02:37:56.291 --> 02:38:01.291
the spread of their name as far as possible and the word Gracie because of

2675
02:38:02.221 --> 02:38:06.960
hoists and because of Horian and what they come with the accomplished in UFC

2676
02:38:06.961 --> 02:38:07.794
one,

2677
02:38:07.860 --> 02:38:12.060
it was one of the most important moments in the history of martial arts.

2678
02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:13.200
Would you agree,
Matt?

2679
02:38:13.370 --> 02:38:14.203
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

2680
02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:15.393
<v 12>I agree.</v>

2681
02:38:15.430 --> 02:38:15.781
<v 8>It's,</v>

2682
02:38:15.781 --> 02:38:20.781
it's for people who don't know the history of it or weren't there when it's

2683
02:38:21.581 --> 02:38:25.900
happening as martial artists,
it was one of the most important moments ever.

2684
02:38:26.020 --> 02:38:28.720
It's like all of a sudden we found out what really works.
Right,

2685
02:38:29.850 --> 02:38:30.550
<v 0>right.</v>

2686
02:38:30.550 --> 02:38:34.780
<v 8>And those guys,
that name,
that Gracie name,</v>

2687
02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:40.480
that shit's like cue tips or Kleenex,

2688
02:38:40.690 --> 02:38:43.690
you know,
it's anonymous.
I don't give a fuck about your tissues.

2689
02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:48.460
If you have tissues made by Kraft macaroni and cheese,

2690
02:38:48.670 --> 02:38:51.940
if they're right next to clean x,
I'm taking the Kleenex.
Okay,

2691
02:38:51.941 --> 02:38:56.650
cause they dominate as does the NFL.
They dominate as well.

2692
02:38:57.670 --> 02:39:00.220
You know what I'm saying?
Matt?
Jesus Christ back me up

2693
02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:08.640
<v 4>100% thank you Matt.
Thank you.</v>

2694
02:39:08.930 --> 02:39:13.320
<v 8>In what way?
Like Daniel,
Daniel was a company.</v>

2695
02:39:17.540 --> 02:39:19.910
You know?
Why do you know why?

2696
02:39:20.380 --> 02:39:21.213
<v 12>Okay.</v>

2697
02:39:21.270 --> 02:39:22.290
<v 8>Do you know why?</v>

2698
02:39:23.580 --> 02:39:27.150
Because they're smart mother fuckers because they're smart motherfuckers and

2699
02:39:27.151 --> 02:39:29.970
they know how to make debt paper son.

2700
02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:36.720
Matt,
don't don't freeze up on me.

2701
02:39:36.721 --> 02:39:40.390
Now we're in the deep end of the pool.
Matt,

2702
02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:46.150
we're not close to the lip.
Hang in there.
Did you see the new guy?
Matt,

2703
02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:52.400
are you with me buddy?
I'm sorry.
Listen man,

2704
02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:54.590
I need to apologize to you as a human being.

2705
02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:56.900
You didn't know what the fuck was going on here.

2706
02:39:56.930 --> 02:40:01.190
You get dragged into this conversation.
Shane Smith calls you.

2707
02:40:01.191 --> 02:40:04.850
It's a where do you live,
sir?
Don't don't tell me.
East Coast,

2708
02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:06.950
west coast or mountain time.

2709
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:11.540
East Coast.
Oh,
too late as fuck.

2710
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:17.400
<v 4>What I'm trying to say is Matt is an awesome dude.
Do you hear this mat?</v>

2711
02:40:20.420 --> 02:40:20.841
He said,

2712
02:40:20.841 --> 02:40:25.841
Matt isn't Shane Smith Just said Matt is an awesome dude and then you'll grace.

2713
02:40:25.851 --> 02:40:28.670
He's an awesome and Daniel grace is an awesome dude.
And what?

2714
02:40:28.671 --> 02:40:30.100
And what they showed me was awesome

2715
02:40:30.220 --> 02:40:33.520
<v 8>credit.
Any of that.
We're not trying to discredit any of that.
Matt,</v>

2716
02:40:33.521 --> 02:40:34.600
you understand this,
correct?

2717
02:40:37.050 --> 02:40:40.110
<v 4>No,
not yet.
Two,
three minutes.
Listen,</v>

2718
02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:45.320
what's important Matt is you understand that I respect and adore Daniel Gracie

2719
02:40:46.561 --> 02:40:47.940
and anybody gets in there.

2720
02:40:48.130 --> 02:40:49.690
<v 8>I just think she had a,</v>

2721
02:40:49.691 --> 02:40:54.691
if I could be have been there when Henzel and all those other guys are trying to

2722
02:40:54.791 --> 02:40:57.940
talk Daniel into using the last name.
Gracie.
Oh,

2723
02:40:58.080 --> 02:40:59.950
so let's think this shit through.

2724
02:40:59.951 --> 02:41:04.570
So Fendley salvage it pretty good.
What's the name is Silva.

2725
02:41:04.590 --> 02:41:06.790
Okay.
Okay.
We're going to be fine.
We don't need Gracie.

2726
02:41:06.910 --> 02:41:11.100
What are you crazy as your name?
Hanzo.
Hey,
Dez Hanzo.

2727
02:41:11.110 --> 02:41:14.200
Do you support this Daniel character?
Yeah.
What the fuck difference does it make?

2728
02:41:14.201 --> 02:41:18.680
What noise you make with your mouth that represents his last name a week.

2729
02:41:18.690 --> 02:41:22.960
Cool.
Jesus Christ for the greater good of the humanity of the world.

2730
02:41:22.961 --> 02:41:24.310
How about we forget about

2731
02:41:25.810 --> 02:41:30.810
imperial dictatorships and names that dominate sports history.

2732
02:41:32.090 --> 02:41:32.950
You feel me,
Matt?

2733
02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:38.630
<v 4>Do you know eating marijuana is different if you,
hey,
Matt.
Matt,
Matt.</v>

2734
02:41:40.580 --> 02:41:45.230
I'm sorry dude.
This is so rude.
You love him.
I love you,
Matt.

2735
02:41:45.290 --> 02:41:50.290
I'm so sad that I dragged you into this and even though I did it with no malice,

2736
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:55.770
so they met Rhonda percent.
Matt Ruskin,
Ruskin

2737
02:41:56.220 --> 02:42:00.240
<v 8>do this to be mean.
I just did this because that's my nature.</v>

2738
02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:04.740
I am the Scorpion.
You are the frog.
This is how shit goes down.

2739
02:42:04.890 --> 02:42:06.120
I didn't mean to do this.

2740
02:42:06.250 --> 02:42:11.110
<v 4>Matt Ruskin is a beautiful,
Hey Matt Ruskin.
Will you do,
will you do my podcast,</v>

2741
02:42:14.350 --> 02:42:18.860
<v 8>sir?
I'd be honored if you would do my podcast when we do.
Will you do with chain?</v>

2742
02:42:23.010 --> 02:42:28.010
<v 4>Have just opened up in a hot tub in San Diego with the stop it.</v>

2743
02:42:28.391 --> 02:42:31.720
No dolphins and no Sharman.

2744
02:42:32.480 --> 02:42:34.460
<v 8>Ask Him if he'd ever experiment with a dolphin.</v>

2745
02:42:35.430 --> 02:42:36.263
<v 0>Matt,</v>

2746
02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:42.680
<v 4>just tell him you love him.
Matt,</v>

2747
02:42:43.770 --> 02:42:46.650
<v 8>have you ever watched a Rodeo and felt sorry for the bowls?</v>

2748
02:42:49.260 --> 02:42:53.780
<v 4>Nothing.
Listen,
Matt,
I love the fuck out of here.
Even though we've never met.</v>

2749
02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:58.850
He's a good man.
If Shane Smith says you're good man,

2777
02:44:38.340 --> 02:44:42.900
Would that design did I can wear every day?

2780
02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:51.490
<v 5>number three.</v>

2781

<v 4>But that's like pimping and pissing at pissing of your,</v>

2783
02:44:56.810 --> 02:44:59.220

That's the one over your right shoulder right there.

But then once I fell in love with the Wendy's cat and the second cat is my

2788
02:45:17.171 --> 02:45:17.690
favorite.

2789
02:45:17.690 --> 02:45:18.710
<v 5>Can I say one thing?</v>

2790
02:45:19.250 --> 02:45:23.360
Tom Ford is making money off of doing these uh,

2791
02:45:23.420 --> 02:45:28.420

2792
02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:30.170

02:45:33.840 --> 02:45:37.950
<v 5>17th Century.
He's taken tapestries making snippy zone sound for 1000 bucks.</v>

2795
02:45:38.460 --> 02:45:43.460
I want a red fucking man fucking shoe that I saw on Twitter.

2796
02:45:45.011 --> 02:45:48.420
And the fact Joe shows the fact that I don't have those shoes.

2797
02:45:48.650 --> 02:45:50.850
<v 4>I don't have the shoes make me fucking pissed off.</v>

2798
02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:54.720
I want to wear those when I go to the Academy Awards.

2799
02:45:54.790 --> 02:45:57.320
Although I haven't made the film.
I want to,

2800
02:45:57.370 --> 02:46:00.150
they want to do the right thing.
Joe.

2801
02:46:01.950 --> 02:46:06.750
No Academy Awards.
Okay.
Did you don't go to the desk,

2802
02:46:07.290 --> 02:46:11.990
the death star
Star.

2803
02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:16.760
If I don't get a pair of those shoes,
I'm fucking pissed off.
We need new shoes.

2804
02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:20.690
We need low one slippers slippers

2805
02:46:21.390 --> 02:46:24.900
<v 5>that he has designed and made.
Otherwise I'm fucking pissed the same.</v>

2806
02:46:24.901 --> 02:46:28.100
Brian does not have any time to design and make slippers.

2807
02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:31.810
<v 4>Well he does because I see them on Twitter.
Listen,
Brian and I,</v>

2808
02:46:31.811 --> 02:46:34.810
if we're working together for at least a decade now,

2809
02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:38.440
2003 bad at those are bad ass shoe.

2810
02:46:40.900 --> 02:46:43.100
I want them,
but I want them more plus,
no doubt.
Okay.

2811
02:46:43.350 --> 02:46:48.090
<v 5>Made out of sort of a how long we've been working together for 10 years.</v>

2812
02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:50.220
This is the most important thing with Brian.

2813
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:54.120
<v 4>Can't tell Brian what to do.
You can't let,</v>

2814
02:46:54.121 --> 02:46:56.640
Brian can't put any pressure on him.

2815
02:46:56.820 --> 02:46:59.400
You can tell the bookie at least a couple of days a week.

2816
02:46:59.401 --> 02:47:03.690
You have to show up and do this,
but other than that,
you got to leave them alone.

2817
02:47:04.020 --> 02:47:07.350
That's the only way these hypnotic cats get discovered.

2818
02:47:07.410 --> 02:47:10.350
I will fight what that shit.

2819
02:47:10.351 --> 02:47:13.580
If you live in a fucking cubicle and you're panicking,

2820
02:47:13.590 --> 02:47:17.030
taken Adderall all day just to get through your work load,

2821
02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:22.050
I will fight Royce Gracie.
If I can have a pair of those,
shave that you say that,

2822
02:47:22.051 --> 02:47:26.430
but no one,
no one has ever gotten you into a proper rear naked choke.

2823
02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:30.980
If you you,
if you,
if you choke Hanks,

2824
02:47:31.450 --> 02:47:32.283
if you,

2825
02:47:32.340 --> 02:47:33.630
<v 5>if you choked me,</v>

2826
02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:38.460
you would win in 3.2 seconds,
but I would,

2827
02:47:38.490 --> 02:47:43.200
I would be wearing the shoes.
That's what I need.
Well,
you'd win.
I'm giving.

2828
02:47:43.500 --> 02:47:48.180
I can seen,
but I want the shoes.
I don't even know how we got to this credit.

2829
02:47:48.181 --> 02:47:52.500
I don't know either.
I'm telling you gotten off track the kids on his way,

2830
02:47:52.530 --> 02:47:56.130
which by the way,
fuck that.
Your shoes are amazing.
Your design.

2831
02:47:56.380 --> 02:48:00.810
<v 4>They're amazing.
I know I said
last time,</v>

2832
02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:04.020
your fucking designs are good.
I want those fucking shoes.

2833
02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.490
I understand what you're saying,

2834
02:48:05.491 --> 02:48:09.630
but what you need to understand is the next cat is going to be on the next
level.

2835
02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:12.720
No.
Why are you putting the pressure on me getting be looking at me as a,

2836
02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:16.890
I'm like fuck those slippers.
Death Squad.

2837
02:48:22.170 --> 02:48:27.160
Chocolate filled Twinkies when I fucking around.
By the way,

2838
02:48:27.190 --> 02:48:30.300
you're fucking spine is bulging.
You're eating a fucking twinkie.

2839
02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:34.720
I'm allowed to have some fucking shoes.
Twinkie show shop.

2840
02:48:35.370 --> 02:48:38.510
It's a chocolate.
You don't even make that.
Not like this shit.

2841
02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:42.690
You're putting your tire when you want to fix a flat expired a long time ago.

2842
02:48:42.750 --> 02:48:46.230
Cockroaches and Twinkies are the only things that will survive the apocalypse.

2843
02:48:46.260 --> 02:48:49.310
What do you mean you're getting ready?
You're getting ready.

2844
02:48:49.311 --> 02:48:52.530
You're good fucking getting your Twinkies ready,
but I want my shoes ready.

2845
02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:55.440
As the fucking bomb goes off,
I'm going to be looking good.

2846
02:48:56.210 --> 02:49:01.190
<v 5>Anyone right now collecting their thoughts and gathering their finances on their</v>

2847
02:49:01.191 --> 02:49:06.191
way to the bank on their way to financing their very first yoga studio.

2848
02:49:07.410 --> 02:49:08.070
I want you to

2849
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:10.530
<v 1>know,
I know this,
this,</v>

2850
02:49:10.531 --> 02:49:14.910
this podcast doesn't represent how you feel right now.

2851
02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:20.070
When you,
when you're,
when you're in that train and you're thinking

2852
02:49:20.990 --> 02:49:24.470
<v 4>as you make the connection to the bus on your way to work,</v>

2853
02:49:24.471 --> 02:49:26.030
I don't want to be that guy.

2854
02:49:26.660 --> 02:49:31.660
I don't want to be added control worrying about asteroids within Kestrel

2855
02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:33.170
viruses.

2856
02:49:33.171 --> 02:49:37.730
It looked like fucking aliens grown inside my shit tract.

2857
02:49:38.900 --> 02:49:40.080
Be that guy.

2858
02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:44.600
<v 1>Cool.
How does this help me?</v>

2859
02:49:45.410 --> 02:49:47.320
This helps me because squad mates,

2860
02:49:48.620 --> 02:49:53.620
because this helps all of us because we need all of the information about all of

2861
02:49:56.051 --> 02:50:01.051
the possible realities of all of the human beings existing in this temporary

2862
02:50:03.231 --> 02:50:07.460
state that we both exist in.
That you all three of us right now,

2863
02:50:07.490 --> 02:50:08.350
this 2000

2864
02:50:08.450 --> 02:50:11.780
<v 5>can I say one thing?
Let me say whatever the fuck you want.
Joe Rogen,</v>

2865
02:50:13.370 --> 02:50:17.570
taekwondo motherfucker,
the voice of the MMA.

2866
02:50:18.210 --> 02:50:21.180
<v 4>How drunk are you?
Fear factor.
Fear factor.</v>

2867
02:50:21.840 --> 02:50:23.580
Fear factor too.

2868

<v 5>Are you secret and and and fashion.
Fucking mogul.</v>

2869
02:50:28.900 --> 02:50:32.410

2870
02:50:33.310 --> 02:50:35.740

2871
02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:38.380
<v 1>and you know,
we're going to find this cow who made those shoes?</v>

2872
02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:41.350
We're going to ask her ass chill him at Psu.
That girl.

2873

<v 5>I will say,</v>

2875
02:50:44.040 --> 02:50:48.360
oh we'll say one last thing cause I just tossed cost has been going on for $800

2876
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:52.740
but I will say this.
How about fucking Joe Rogan?

2877
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:57.950
Joe Rogan fucking shut up between fear factor and your UFC shit and all your

2878
02:50:58.981 --> 02:51:02.490
other shit.
But the fucking podcast that you do,
and by the way,

2879
02:51:02.491 --> 02:51:05.880
I'm sitting here in a room with 700 cameras that red bands set up.

2880
02:51:06.180 --> 02:51:08.490
I'm sitting here doing,
we're doing podcasts with you.

2881
02:51:08.760 --> 02:51:11.880
The fact that you do these podcasts and you finance these podcasts,

2882
02:51:11.881 --> 02:51:13.590
you need to these buckets.
I've got to say,

2883
02:51:13.770 --> 02:51:17.730
I fucking handed to you my friend I fucking handed to you.

2884
02:51:17.790 --> 02:51:20.410
This all may stuff thing.

2888
02:51:33.820 --> 02:51:36.230
<v 1>the fucking take it.
I understand sweetie pie,
but here,</v>

2889
02:51:36.290 --> 02:51:38.540
here's the problem with that.
You can never believe you.

2890
02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:44.240
If you start talking to me in these crazy superlatives and tell me how awesome I

2891
02:51:44.241 --> 02:51:46.100
am,
like this guy is basically full of Shit,

2892
02:51:46.450 --> 02:51:49.690
<v 4>okay?
I'm going to tell you the truth.</v>

2893
02:51:51.610 --> 02:51:56.380
Lock it up and throw it.
Oh,

2894
02:51:56.420 --> 02:51:59.150
<v 5>now,
see now this is going to be meeting you in the back alley,</v>

2895
02:51:59.420 --> 02:52:02.660
but I'm going to tell you the truth is you don't have to do these fucking

2896
02:52:02.661 --> 02:52:05.950
podcast.
You don't have to fucking sit here and deal with shit heads like me,

2897
02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:07.000
but I will tell you

2898
02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:11.720
<v 4>you want some in your wrong,
sir,
because the money comes into us</v>

2899
02:52:13.340 --> 02:52:14.900
paying off us.

2900
02:52:15.250 --> 02:52:16.083
<v 5>To us,</v>

2901
02:52:16.090 --> 02:52:21.090
US talking about this shit is because you fucking paid for this fucking room

2902
02:52:21.281 --> 02:52:24.430
with all the cameras and the fucking microphone.
I did not pay for this room.

2903
02:52:24.460 --> 02:52:28.660
This is mostly Brian's.
The only thing I paid for it,
whether it by camp,
the

2904
02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:30.993
Imac,

2905
02:52:35.850 --> 02:52:38.170
give Kudos to you and if you don't take it,

2906
02:52:38.410 --> 02:52:42.030
then I'm going to put this pin up yours.
Okay?
This is you.

2907
02:52:42.700 --> 02:52:45.960
Normally I would say thank you very much,
but this particular,

2908
02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:50.640
why do I get shit if I go?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2909
02:52:50.650 --> 02:52:52.300
You are absolutely allowed to,

2910
02:52:52.301 --> 02:52:54.880
but I have to tell you that in this particular situation,

2911
02:52:54.881 --> 02:52:58.990
since we're at the Ice House,
this was 99% Brian's work,

2912
02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:01.660
which I give him Kudos.
Well,

2913
02:53:01.661 --> 02:53:05.710
I'm trying to fucking buy fucking footwear off of me.
Won't give it to one.
No,
no.

2914
02:53:08.010 --> 02:53:11.670
<v 4>What I'm saying is that I don't have any deal with it,
although he's,</v>

2915
02:53:12.620 --> 02:53:15.230
<v 5>I gave her,
Mary made a strange situation,</v>

2916
02:53:15.231 --> 02:53:19.730
but Brian and I had been friends and employees and I tried to distance myself

2917
02:53:19.731 --> 02:53:21.980
from the employee aspect as much as possible,

2918
02:53:21.981 --> 02:53:26.620
but he really created this whole room.
He decorated it.
The only thing,

2919
02:53:26.630 --> 02:53:27.640
he's a smart motherfucker,

2920
02:53:28.600 --> 02:53:32.510
our friend Brendan gave us that brancher Brandon gave us that picture.

2921
02:53:32.990 --> 02:53:37.030
I asked him to put that up and that's it.
Other than that,
it's just a,
it's salt.

2922
02:53:37.031 --> 02:53:39.220
Brian's cool.
You don't have to do these podcasts and the,

2923
02:53:39.221 --> 02:53:41.440
and the fact that the fact that you do these us,

2924
02:53:41.900 --> 02:53:45.020
the fact that you have Anthony Bordain and the fact that you have me to vet,

2925
02:53:45.050 --> 02:53:47.270
you have all these people on that is something special.

2926
02:53:47.271 --> 02:53:49.250
And I know we always get to this at the end of it,

2927
02:53:49.251 --> 02:53:53.840
but I got to say what you're doing with,
with Brian and with yourself,

2928
02:53:54.170 --> 02:53:58.010
come on now at least accept the fact that that's an important fucking this

2929
02:53:58.040 --> 02:54:00.380
fucking thing.
And by the way,
if you don't accept it,

2930
02:54:00.381 --> 02:54:04.310
I will do something bad with this.
Listen,
I have a crop,

2931
02:54:04.311 --> 02:54:08.120
my God tee shirt on and I got my keys and my knuckles and I'm ready to fucking

2932
02:54:08.121 --> 02:54:11.600
party.
I'm telling you,

2933
02:54:12.950 --> 02:54:17.600
you're asking me to take the Koolaid and fucking brush.
My teeth would.
But

2934
02:54:18.010 --> 02:54:18.990
<v 4>Joe Rogan Lazy.</v>

2935
02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:25.030
Even though my gums have lacerations on them,
which will allow the,

2936
02:54:25.230 --> 02:54:26.110
the secret liquid

2937
02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:30.780
<v 5>liquid from the Koolaid get into my bloodstream.
I'm not willing,
I'm not willing.</v>

2938
02:54:30.781 --> 02:54:31.240
It's a,
it's,

2939
02:54:31.240 --> 02:54:34.740
I want everyone in the Joe Rogan universe to tweet them on the fuck out of him

2940
02:54:34.741 --> 02:54:39.250
because Joe Rogan is the fucking map alcohol.

2941
02:54:39.540 --> 02:54:42.420
There's a lot of douchebags that are me 20 years from now.

2942
02:54:42.421 --> 02:54:46.650
They're going to fuck that guy.
The reality,
I'm going to say,

2943
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:50.640
I like Joe Rogan.
I like red band death squad.
Powerful.

2944
02:54:50.850 --> 02:54:55.530
I love all you guys.
I love you three hours in five minutes.

2945
02:54:55.680 --> 02:55:00.060
Listen Shane,
you're a bad motherfucker.
Fuck you.
I gotta Tell Ya,

2946
02:55:00.440 --> 02:55:04.310
this is very,
very unusual podcasts but all podcasts,

2947
02:55:04.310 --> 02:55:07.070
<v 8>but my favorite one of our time.
Yeah,
it might be up there.</v>

2948
02:55:07.250 --> 02:55:08.300
It's probably number one.

2949
02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:09.300
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

2950
02:55:09.300 --> 02:55:14.270
The only weird thing about this is we only have real meaningful conversations

2951
02:55:14.271 --> 02:55:18.620
with headphones and microphones and hold on,
I'm going to tell you this,

2952
02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:23.330
you guys like,
I seriously respect what the fuck you're doing.

2953
02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:27.560
And there are people out there in the fucking world are listening here and I got

2954
02:55:27.570 --> 02:55:30.470
to say,
I'm fucking stoked to be here.

2955
02:55:30.650 --> 02:55:35.230
And so if it's you and nobody can see me or maybe you can see me,

2956
02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:39.350
I'm pointing at you,
read back.
If it's you,
then fucking thank you very much.

2957
02:55:39.351 --> 02:55:42.110
Because you know what my favorite thing to do?

2958
02:55:42.111 --> 02:55:46.730
My favorite press ever like I have to do press all the time.
And by the way,

2959
02:55:46.731 --> 02:55:51.170
you don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about because vice sent fucking

2960
02:55:51.171 --> 02:55:53.900

2961
02:55:54.140 --> 02:55:58.610
We have the fucking only interviews with Kim Jong Il.
We have,

2962
02:55:58.760 --> 02:56:02.810

CBS,
NBC,

2963
02:56:02.811 --> 02:56:04.910
everybody fucking wants.
You know where I come,

2964
02:56:05.090 --> 02:56:08.660
I come to the Joe fucking Rogan podcast and I'll tell you why.

2965
02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:12.080
Because those are the only fucking people I give a shit about.

2966
02:56:12.350 --> 02:56:15.680
And that's why I'm here.
I love you fucking guys.
And by the way,

2967
02:56:15.681 --> 02:56:19.040
if that's your fucking Shit,
red redband great.
And by the way,

2968
02:56:19.041 --> 02:56:20.900
you don't have to choose me.
And by the way,

2969
02:56:21.530 --> 02:56:25.190
<v 8>by the way,
and by the way,
by the way,
by the way,</v>

2970
02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:28.200
<v 5>you don't have to do this and you do it.
And I got to say,</v>

2971
02:56:28.350 --> 02:56:31.710
I fucking love you guys and I love what you do.
And you can tell me to fuck off.

2972
02:56:33.290 --> 02:56:35.270
<v 8>Listen,
we'd love you too,
man.
It doesn't,</v>

2973
02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:39.960
there's no need for anybody to take any extra recognition for what the fuck.

2974
02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:43.590
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I know you're not.
I know you're not.
What you're,

2975
02:56:43.610 --> 02:56:47.660
what you're trying to do is what any cool person tries to do as you're trying to

2976
02:56:47.780 --> 02:56:51.990
spread the love as far as possible to as many people as the piece of

2977
02:56:52.240 --> 02:56:56.200
<v 5>people that listen to this fucking podcast or the people that I give a shit</v>

2978
02:56:56.201 --> 02:56:57.990
about and I don't give a shit about that.
Well,

2979
02:56:58.230 --> 02:56:59.820
<v 8>the people that you give a shit about the,</v>

2980
02:56:59.821 --> 02:57:02.440
don't listen to this because they don't know about it,
but the,

2981
02:57:02.441 --> 02:57:07.441
the reality is that that the ethic of what Brian is trying to put forth and when

2982
02:57:08.281 --> 02:57:13.281
I am an unquestionably without a shadow of a doubt in my heart what you're

2983
02:57:14.311 --> 02:57:15.300
trying to put forward,

2984
02:57:15.930 --> 02:57:20.930
it is what resonates with a lot of the people that are sort of waking up in the

2985
02:57:21.391 --> 02:57:26.391
middle of history and looking at this crazy world that is handicapped and side

2986
02:57:27.131 --> 02:57:32.131
tracked and at hobbled by these ancient traditions that were written back when

2987
02:57:32.641 --> 02:57:37.641
people couldn't even fly fucking planes and didn't even have printed type and

2988
02:57:38.251 --> 02:57:43.251
there was no internet and w w unfortunately this distribution of information is

2989
02:57:45.301 --> 02:57:50.301
far more swift than the absorption of it amongst the people and the altercation

2990
02:57:51.061 --> 02:57:54.390
or the changing of the culture because of that information.
And you're,

2991
02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:57.600
you're at the front of the,
let me tell you,
you're in the front of,
you

2992
02:58:01.310 --> 02:58:02.143
sent

2993
02:58:02.370 --> 02:58:04.980
<v 4>people to,</v>

2994
02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:09.540
I have done none of this.

2995
02:58:12.130 --> 02:58:13.680
I put Brian on broom closet.

2996
02:58:13.810 --> 02:58:17.260
What is the Blue Cross Blue Shield for dental?

2997
02:58:18.130 --> 02:58:22.030
If we can finish with this one last thought about you just finished with this

2998
02:58:22.031 --> 02:58:26.170
one last thought.
What is this one last thought?
Why we need to wrap it up?

2999
02:58:27.070 --> 02:58:31.450
Can we just say,
I bought Daba Shabak Gazoo snowflake.

3000
02:58:31.580 --> 02:58:35.130
This thought is,
maybe it's about fucking dolphin,
right?
Alright.

3001
02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:40.090
Fuck the dolphins.
I love the dolphins.
I don't give a shit what you say,
right?

3002
02:58:40.100 --> 02:58:44.670
Team people.
Dave people,
teen people.
