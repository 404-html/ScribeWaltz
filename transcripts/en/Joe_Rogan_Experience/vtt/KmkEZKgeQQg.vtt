<v Speaker 2>this is the one place where you're not going to hear the word count.</v>

26
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

28
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:34.420
<v Speaker 2>There'll be 45 minutes because as we understand that Americans don't like the</v>

29
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 2>word count.</v>

30

<v Speaker 2>Some Americans.</v>

<v Speaker 2>we'll get one.</v>

37
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.140
<v Speaker 2>Until that day there was a,</v>

38
00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch of women that were trying to take it back.</v>

39
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Who Was it?</v>

<v Speaker 2>the guys we fucked girls.</v>

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.083
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

43
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to take it back through trying to like you,</v>

44
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

45
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 2>take that and cut back the word.</v>

46
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.191
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

47
00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm very dead inside my head.</v>

48
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 2>What's the matter,</v>

49
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 2>David here?</v>

50
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 2>David.</v>

51
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 2>David's having this dry.</v>

52
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

53
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.911
<v Speaker 2>it might,</v>

54
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:01.960
<v Speaker 2>it might have disconnected.</v>

55
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 2>This is fun.</v>

57
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.741
<v Speaker 2>For the huge Amy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You might plug in.</v>

61
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.790
<v Speaker 2>There's a little bit of an issue.</v>

62
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 2>I feel like there's a pressure differential.</v>

63
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.503
<v Speaker 2>That's a bird feeling.</v>

64
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 2>You only have one ear on to,</v>

65
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

104
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.411
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

105
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:41.621
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

106
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:41.861
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

107
00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

108
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I hear me,</v>

109
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Dave.</v>

110
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

111
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.661
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

112
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>

113
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.550
<v Speaker 2>So I always hear Dave.</v>

114
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 2>So why,</v>

115
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.640
<v Speaker 2>why did you choose that as your podcast title?</v>

116
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 2>We're Canadians and a content is not as,</v>

117
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 2>not nearly as bad and Canada's really swear word.</v>

118
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

119
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

120
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.483
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

121
00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they need to put out.</v>

122
00:01:59.531 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 2>Some sort of a periodic table of the atomic weight of swear words</v>

123
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.300
<v Speaker 2>would be quite,</v>

124
00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 2>quite heavy but heavier on the American version.</v>

125
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.923
<v Speaker 2>But here,</v>

126
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.863
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

127
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 2>in America con actually just drop through the crust of the earth and right down</v>

128
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 2>to the core you will go through the other side.</v>

129
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.550
<v Speaker 2>So I guess we just found that patently ridiculous.</v>

130
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

131
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 2>we use,</v>

132
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.553
<v Speaker 2>we like,</v>

133
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.723

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.780
<v Speaker 2>What does your dad like?</v>

140
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.783

<v Speaker 2>they can't fuck you up anymore.</v>

154
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

155
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 2>But my dad was a real really fond of that word and English Canadian.</v>

156
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.661
<v Speaker 3>He full Canadian.</v>

157
00:03:01.661 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 3>But being Canadian is kind of like being English a little bit on your money's</v>

158
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:06.754
<v Speaker 3>still.</v>

159
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 3>And we get all the English movies on English,</v>

160
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 3>TV show we a pledge allegiance to the queen.</v>

161
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 3>And school,</v>

162
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.241
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

163
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:14.150
<v Speaker 3>and I still,</v>

164
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 3>so it's still going on possibly.</v>

165
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

166
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 3>And in our sleep,</v>

167
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 3>so many good things about Canada yet so many preposterous.</v>

168
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.671
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

169
00:03:20.671 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 3>It's the fact,</v>

170
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

171
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 3>the fact that a monarchy still exists at all is preposterous as great on paper.</v>

172
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

173
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 3>Well the monarchy,</v>

174
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.651

00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:29.881
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

176

180
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.660

181
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.981
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

188
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 3>the monarchy other than the fact that people wanted celebrities and that was the</v>

189
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 3>only celebrities they had.</v>

190
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

191

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.660
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.893
<v Speaker 3>Good for him.</v>

200
00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Progressive.</v>

201
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

202
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.203
<v Speaker 3>So ahead of his time.</v>

203
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

204
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

205
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 3>that is an interesting thing.</v>

206
00:04:03.401 --> 00:04:05.500
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Prince Charles Lady,</v>

207
00:04:05.501 --> 00:04:10.501
<v Speaker 3>Di's saga was essentially one of our first reality things to enjoy.</v>

208
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

209
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.650
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

210
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 3>That was madness when it happened.</v>

211
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 3>It was so huge.</v>

212
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 3>And then someone said,</v>

213
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.821
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

214
00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:20.821
<v Speaker 3>what if we just make housewives in orange county royalty and a,</v>

215
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 3>and you don't have to pay them as much as the king and Queen and you can cancel</v>

216
00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

217
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.343
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

218
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Those shows are wonderful there.</v>

219
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen an episode of any of their fascinating.</v>

220
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.820
<v Speaker 3>The Beverly Hills one is there was,</v>

221
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.071
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

222
00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 3>there's different versions of them,</v>

223
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:35.151
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

224
00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:35.970
<v Speaker 3>And different versions.</v>

225
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 3>You get to see the geographical creepiness of like Atlanta is its own thing.</v>

226
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:40.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

227
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 3>Atlanta is not a bad one.</v>

228
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:43.150
<v Speaker 3>The worst one was jersey.</v>

229
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking savage people.</v>

230
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 3>My ancestors,</v>

231
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.270
<v Speaker 3>those fucking savage monkey folk that live in the worst.</v>

232
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Anything cut the first of the version,</v>

233
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 3>the worst of anything.</v>

234
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.121
<v Speaker 3>The worst.</v>

235
00:04:55.121 --> 00:04:55.511
<v Speaker 3>The worst.</v>

236
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:57.370
<v Speaker 3>Penicillin is the Jersey Penicillin.</v>

237
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.770
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

238
00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 3>CSI Jersey was terrible by the way.</v>

239
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.731
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

240
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:01.564

241
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

242
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm the Beverly Hills.</v>

243
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.540
<v Speaker 3>One of the,</v>

244
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.240
<v Speaker 3>all of them were fascinating and it was take,</v>

245
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.620
<v Speaker 3>take people forced them in these situations where they're going to have his</v>

246
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 3>artificial disputes.</v>

247
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.921
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

248
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:17.921
<v Speaker 3>it was crazy to me is watching people succumb to the pressure of all of that</v>

249
00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:18.620
<v Speaker 3>attention.</v>

250

252
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.370
<v Speaker 3>And then you're going to just thrust them into this massively popular,</v>

253
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.593
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

254

<v Speaker 3>Give cause fame will destroy.</v>

273
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 3>If you're a brilliant artist,</v>

274
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 3>fame will destroy you.</v>

275
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.850
<v Speaker 3>If there's nothing underneath the fame,</v>

276
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.631
<v Speaker 3>it's this,</v>

277
00:05:55.631 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing to hold it up.</v>

278
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.930
<v Speaker 3>While I remember watching Kelsey Grammer's wife,</v>

279
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 3>I had met her before,</v>

280
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:02.750
<v Speaker 3>she seemed like a very nice lady.</v>

281
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Camille,</v>

282
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Camille.</v>

283
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 3>And then she,</v>

284
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:05.051
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

285
00:06:05.051 --> 00:06:05.601
<v Speaker 3>I forgot her name.</v>

286
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:06.434
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

287
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to just contact owner.</v>

288
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 3>He has a huge Camille Fan.</v>

289
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.463
<v Speaker 3>I have a tattoo.</v>

290
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.221
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna say,</v>

291
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 3>do you have a tattoo?</v>

292
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 3>But she decided to play the heel.</v>

293
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 3>And the Prac,</v>

294
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 3>it was so obvious that the pressure was just overwhelming.</v>

295
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:25.850
<v Speaker 3>The hatred that was coming her way.</v>

296
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 3>She had decided she was going to be the boss bitch on the show and just let</v>

297
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:30.491
<v Speaker 3>everybody know,</v>

298
00:06:30.491 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

299
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 3>this is how it is and I'm,</v>

300
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:36.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm here to run things and just the swamp of evil.</v>

301
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.450
<v Speaker 3>That came her way and then she's like,</v>

302
00:06:38.451 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 3>God quit done.</v>

303
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 3>Fuck this show.</v>

304
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.101
<v Speaker 3>And she,</v>

305
00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 3>she bailed out of it.</v>

306
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.220
<v Speaker 3>Good for her.</v>

307
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

308
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 3>It's even changed that role or was it like a producer and said here's your,</v>

309
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 3>well according to Kelsey he told her like,</v>

310
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.101
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

311
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:52.431
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

312
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 3>this is what you've always wanted here.</v>

313
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 3>Like cause that's like what led to their divorce or what was happening during</v>

314
00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.780
<v Speaker 3>then them getting divorced,</v>

315
00:06:59.781 --> 00:07:00.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

316
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:00.920
<v Speaker 3>and essentially said,</v>

317
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

318
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 3>this is what you've always wanted.</v>

319
00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 3>Like don't think you understand this,</v>

320
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 3>so go to the good luck with it.</v>

321
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.511
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

322
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

323
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.480
<v Speaker 3>she just kind of vanished afterwards.</v>

324
00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:11.691
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

325
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:12.524
<v Speaker 3>fuck all this,</v>

326
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 3>which is wise on her part.</v>

327
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:14.351
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

328
00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

329
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 3>she recognize what it is,</v>

330
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.981
<v Speaker 3>but they're like those,</v>

331
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:19.130
<v Speaker 3>those people that are on it.</v>

332
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:19.461
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

333
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:23.410
<v Speaker 3>I know some people who know some folks that are on that show and it's,</v>

334
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 3>they'd just go crazy.</v>

335
00:07:24.441 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 3>They start to pop and pills and losing their mind.</v>

336
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 3>They're in therapy every day and it's just madness.</v>

337
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

338
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:35.050
<v Speaker 3>That desire for fame with nothing more to it than other than a desire to be</v>

339
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:37.400
<v Speaker 3>famous can only drive you insane.</v>

340
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

341
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.481
<v Speaker 3>Cause I think fame,</v>

342
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.231
<v Speaker 3>fame as a,</v>

343
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 3>as an emergent property of doing something right is bearable,</v>

344
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's products but so strange and so difficult to truly manage.</v>

345
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.430
<v Speaker 3>But you can at least say,</v>

346
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:51.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't define myself by the fame.</v>

347
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 3>I define myself by the work that created the fame.</v>

348
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.041
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

349
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:55.320
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

350
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Whereas if there's no work underneath it,</v>

351
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.673
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

352
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

353
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 3>you only exist in so much as people are aware of you.</v>

354
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 3>You exist in those moments when you walk into a room and everyone's staring at</v>

355
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:06.580
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

356
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.640
<v Speaker 3>That's what you look for.</v>

357
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.533
<v Speaker 3>And that's that.</v>

358
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I have that anyway because of my body.</v>

359
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.780
<v Speaker 3>So I guess I know real famous.</v>

360
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:15.614
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

361
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 3>And your and the horrible allergy you have to pants.</v>

362
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

363
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 3>I can't wear pants.</v>

364
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

365
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.550
<v Speaker 3>Every time I walk in a room.</v>

366
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.731
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

367
00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:23.564
<v Speaker 3>I always say like that,</v>

368
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.460
<v Speaker 3>that uh,</v>

369
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 3>that fame is a property of the beholder,</v>

370
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:28.064
<v Speaker 3>not the beheld.</v>

371
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.510
<v Speaker 3>And that that fame only exists along long.</v>

372
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 3>Somebody in the room knows who you are,</v>

373
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:32.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

374
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.081
<v Speaker 3>In a minute,</v>

375
00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:34.340
<v Speaker 3>you're in a room where no one knows you,</v>

376
00:08:34.341 --> 00:08:35.630
<v Speaker 3>your fame evaporates.</v>

377
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 3>That is one of the weirdest interrogations I've ever gotten is when people go,</v>

378
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 3>Woo,</v>

379
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:40.870
<v Speaker 3>why did these people know you?</v>

380
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.153
<v Speaker 3>What do you do?</v>

381
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Who are you and shit.</v>

382
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

383
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

384
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.260
<v Speaker 3>I take a photo with you there.</v>

385
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:46.941
<v Speaker 3>Where somebody,</v>

386
00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:47.970
<v Speaker 3>but I don't know who they were.</v>

387
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.261
<v Speaker 3>Things.</v>

388
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:52.600
<v Speaker 3>They're almost defended that other people know you and they go like,</v>

389
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 3>why you're playing a game with me.</v>

390
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.030
<v Speaker 3>Why are you,</v>

391
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.350
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

392
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Why don't I know you?</v>

393
00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:58.280
<v Speaker 3>They get angry.</v>

394
00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.113
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

395
00:08:59.280 --> 00:08:59.491
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

396
00:08:59.491 --> 00:09:00.041
<v Speaker 3>there also,</v>

397
00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 3>there's the other thing about famous that people feel like they could just start</v>

398
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:03.264
<v Speaker 3>talking to you.</v>

399
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:03.691
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

400
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

401
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

402
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.693
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

403
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 3>They can sit next to you.</v>

404
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:07.921
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

405
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:11.760
<v Speaker 3>You could be in the middle of an intense conversation with your favorite person</v>

406
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:12.330
<v Speaker 3>on the planet.</v>

407
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:13.163
<v Speaker 3>They don't give a fuck.</v>

408
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't I know you haven't been in their house.</v>

409
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 3>I had a living room.</v>

410
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.300
<v Speaker 3>I had a guy come to me in the street and just go,</v>

411
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.141
<v Speaker 3>Hey Dave,</v>

<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>

413
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.221
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

414
00:09:20.221 --> 00:09:20.311
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

415

<v Speaker 3>it must know him.</v>

416
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 3>So he said,</v>

417
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.331
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

418

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:22.644
<v Speaker 3>How are you doing man?</v>

420
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.080

<v Speaker 3>You fucking phony,</v>

423

<v Speaker 3>That was me.</v>

425
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 3>That was you.</v>

426
00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 3>I wish I was better at faces.</v>

427
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.880

428
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 3>This was in downtown La.</v>

429

00:09:36.841 --> 00:09:37.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm just trying to be nice.</v>

434
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:38.703
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

435
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Was he a drunk?</v>

436
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

444
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:46.620
<v Speaker 3>And that was basically it.</v>

445

<v Speaker 3>but even then,</v>

528
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:26.010

543
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange to watch.</v>

544
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.230
<v Speaker 3>It's so strange when you're watching yourself from 20 plus years ago.</v>

545
00:11:49.231 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Say something you don't remember saying.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I never watched,</v>

555
00:11:57.191 --> 00:11:59.110

<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

561
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.630

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.441
<v Speaker 3>And it's not just here,</v>

600
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:52.750
<v Speaker 3>it's every 15 year old in the country.</v>

601
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:53.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

602
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 3>Has One.</v>

603
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.850
<v Speaker 3>And it's like that,</v>

604
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:56.723
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

605
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.071
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

606
00:12:57.071 --> 00:12:58.840
<v Speaker 3>is coming back into significant to these kids.</v>

607
00:12:58.841 --> 00:12:59.050
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

608
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 3>what's fascinating is I don't think those shows are being made anymore.</v>

609
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:03.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

610
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 3>not that.</v>

611
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Not like don't,</v>

612
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's the chuck Lorre type shows that I watch and I go,</v>

613
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm missing a GM.</v>

614
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.450
<v Speaker 3>Why was like,</v>

615
00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.940
<v Speaker 3>why is everyone laughing so hard to be your seen those without the laugh track.</v>

616
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 3>I can imagine that that must be life taking some of those shows and the Big Bang</v>

617
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:23.440
<v Speaker 3>theory and I would like to see that they've removed the laugh track and you</v>

618
00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:27.070
<v Speaker 3>watch it with just the act or sing the words and it's like it's anything funny</v>

619
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:27.760
<v Speaker 3>ever happen on it.</v>

620
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.593
<v Speaker 3>Well it just,</v>

621
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.800
<v Speaker 3>it's strange.</v>

622
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're watching.</v>

623
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:32.044
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

624
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't make any sense.</v>

625
00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:36.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a logical yeah.</v>

626
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.331
<v Speaker 3>And that,</v>

627
00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:37.601
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

628
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

629
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 3>that place people get in their heads where they just go,</v>

630
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.493
<v Speaker 3>it'll be fine.</v>

631
00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

632
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.250
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

633
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.083
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

634
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.380
<v Speaker 3>News radio,</v>

635
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.420
<v Speaker 3>if we did a scene and it didn't get a laugh,</v>

636
00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 3>we rewrote the whole seat.</v>

637
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

638
00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Literally with the audience there.</v>

639
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:50.651
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

640
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 3>I think the term good enough is perfect for comedy.</v>

641
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:53.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

642
00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 3>That's good enough.</v>

643
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.750
<v Speaker 3>People are kind of chuckling while it's to you,</v>

644
00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 3>once you get a certain number of characters that you can get to interact with</v>

645
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 3>each other and predictable ways on those shows,</v>

646
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 3>then they just sort of have them have these little scenes and have different</v>

647
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 3>inflections and different stumbles and they make a show out of it.</v>

648
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.631
<v Speaker 3>And for the audience,</v>

649
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:14.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it just becomes comfort.</v>

650
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Familiarity.</v>

651
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.050
<v Speaker 3>I love it.</v>

652
00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:17.651
<v Speaker 3>I maintain,</v>

653
00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:19.360
<v Speaker 3>that's what drove Charlie sheen crazy.</v>

654
00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.160
<v Speaker 3>It was doing that Goddamn show.</v>

655
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

656
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.170
<v Speaker 3>he did for a long time.</v>

657
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.370
<v Speaker 3>For a long time.</v>

658
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what drove him to the edge.</v>

659
00:14:25.961 --> 00:14:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I thought.</v>

660
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 3>I think he was always crazy.</v>

661
00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.850
<v Speaker 3>But I think when you do a show that you don't enjoy doing or that you don't</v>

662
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.180
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

663
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.010
<v Speaker 3>the guy was in fucking platoon.</v>

664
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:33.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

665
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:33.611
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

666
00:14:33.611 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

667
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was in some amazing pharaoh.</v>

668
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't very funny in that.</v>

669
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.433
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

670
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.663
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't.</v>

671
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:40.960
<v Speaker 3>It was really kind of a bummer.</v>

672
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

673
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.041
<v Speaker 3>they should.</v>

674
00:14:42.041 --> 00:14:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

675
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.630
<v Speaker 3>they should have taken that as a warranty.</v>

676
00:14:43.631 --> 00:14:43.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

677
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:46.990
<v Speaker 3>They should take that company Lindelof that that should stop ending up on all</v>

678
00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:47.824
<v Speaker 3>those companies.</v>

679
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.180
<v Speaker 3>Wall Street.</v>

680
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:49.421
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

681
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:50.860
<v Speaker 3>he was in some giant,</v>

682
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.883
<v Speaker 3>a good way,</v>

683
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 3>the movies and then he's on the show.</v>

684
00:14:54.231 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't really make sense.</v>

685
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

686
00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

687
00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.860
<v Speaker 3>And he's really talented.</v>

688
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Like he's really,</v>

689
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:01.970
<v Speaker 3>really talented actor and really funny.</v>

690
00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

691
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.720
<v Speaker 3>Like great timing.</v>

692
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

693
00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:05.781
<v Speaker 3>what was the,</v>

694
00:15:05.781 --> 00:15:05.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

695
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.560
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

696
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.393
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

697
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.840
<v Speaker 3>like her brothers franchise,</v>

698
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:09.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

699
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:10.183
<v Speaker 3>hot shots.</v>

700
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.320
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

701
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.153
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

702
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.140
<v Speaker 3>It was funny in those,</v>

703
00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.180
<v Speaker 3>they don't make those kind of movies anymore.</v>

704
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Like nobody does jokes anymore.</v>

705
00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.293
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't say,</v>

706
00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

707
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 3>can't do jokes.</v>

708
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.080
<v Speaker 3>Effort is frowned upon.</v>

709
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Think you have to be lazy with your comedy movies or you know,</v>

710
00:15:28.761 --> 00:15:30.230
<v Speaker 3>there's still comedy movies,</v>

711
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.621
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

712
00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 3>There's like the Judd Apatow type films and you know,</v>

713
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:34.641
<v Speaker 3>there's still,</v>

714
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:36.290
<v Speaker 3>they still make comedy movies,</v>

715
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.370
<v Speaker 3>but there's seems like there's not as many anymore.</v>

716
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

717
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 3>Or maybe I just don't go out as much.</v>

718
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of that too.</v>

719
00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

720
00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 3>But it's also like the subject matter is so dangerous now.</v>

721
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Like everything that used to be funny,</v>

722
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:54.590
<v Speaker 3>we watched ace Ventura pet detective with my kids and I did not remember how</v>

723
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:56.630
<v Speaker 3>transphobic that movie is.</v>

724
00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Like the whole movie is one gigantic Trans Joke.</v>

725
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:01.603
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

726
00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:02.793
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

727
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:04.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I've ever seen it.</v>

728
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.481
<v Speaker 3>At the end of it,</v>

729
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:05.811
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

730
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:06.291
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

731
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 3>I forgot.</v>

732
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:08.180
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>

733
00:16:08.181 --> 00:16:09.410
<v Speaker 3>Like the men,</v>

734
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:10.340
<v Speaker 3>when they find that she's a girl,</v>

735
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 3>they're throwing up and or the that she's a boy rather.</v>

736
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:15.470
<v Speaker 3>There's the brushing teeth.</v>

737
00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.780
<v Speaker 3>The scrubbing and mouth out.</v>

739
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:18.860
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's vomiting.</v>

740
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.070
<v Speaker 3>You wouldn't be skewered today.</v>

741
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:23.990
<v Speaker 3>You'd be finished.</v>

742
00:16:23.991 --> 00:16:24.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

743
00:16:24.371 --> 00:16:24.860
<v Speaker 3>it'd be done.</v>

744
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:25.461
<v Speaker 3>And they still,</v>

745
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 3>that whole joke from the crying game.</v>

746
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:27.520
<v Speaker 3>Ugh.</v>

747
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.100
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>

748
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.310
<v Speaker 3>Which is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen it.</v>

749
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Which one came first?</v>

750
00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:32.601
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

751
00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:36.020
<v Speaker 3>Any magic if the trunk crying game did a serious version of Ace Ventura.</v>

752
00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I have an idea.</v>

753
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:40.780
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

754
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.330
<v Speaker 3>forgot about the crying get whole ass talking scene would be totally different.</v>

755
00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

756
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.860
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

757
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.660
<v Speaker 3>I remember watching the crank game going,</v>

758
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.583
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

759
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 3>and heard there's this big twist,</v>

760
00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:51.700
<v Speaker 3>big surprise twist.</v>

761
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:52.653
<v Speaker 3>And that's the guy.</v>

762
00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

763
00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:53.631
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>

764
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:54.550
<v Speaker 3>What happens is that the,</v>

765
00:16:54.551 --> 00:16:55.031
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

766
00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 3>the transvestite turns out to be an IRA spy</v>

767
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.150
<v Speaker 3>because you were already two steps ahead.</v>

768
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.533
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

769
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.600
<v Speaker 3>I forgot that movie.</v>

819
00:18:21.661 --> 00:18:23.220
<v Speaker 4>dressed as like a devil or some shit.</v>

820
00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.500
<v Speaker 4>She was like dancing there.</v>

821
00:18:25.501 --> 00:18:25.890
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

822
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:26.011
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

823
00:18:26.011 --> 00:18:26.311
<v Speaker 4>hi.</v>

824
00:18:26.311 --> 00:18:26.791
<v Speaker 4>How are you?</v>

825
00:18:26.791 --> 00:18:27.624
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing here,</v>

826
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 4>Carrie?</v>

827
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:29.063
<v Speaker 4>Normal person.</v>

828
00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.083
<v Speaker 4>Why here?</v>

829
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.601
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

830
00:18:30.601 --> 00:18:30.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

831
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.200
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

832
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a picture of me with a Antala Bay that knuckle heads to this day uses</v>

833
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.280
<v Speaker 4>evidence that I am a station.</v>

834
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.150
<v Speaker 4>Satan worshiper.</v>

835
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.030
<v Speaker 4>You're merely an associate.</v>

836
00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.431
<v Speaker 4>Satan associate.</v>

837
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:45.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm Satan to Jason's.</v>

838
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

839
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what they say now.</v>

840
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:48.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

841
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.280
<v Speaker 4>and that's fanboy.</v>

842
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.360
<v Speaker 4>I loved that.</v>

843
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.200
<v Speaker 4>That that's something people are,</v>

844
00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:53.090
<v Speaker 4>you still worry about it.</v>

845
00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:54.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm a Satan family.</v>

846
00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.491
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

847
00:18:56.491 --> 00:18:56.671
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

848
00:18:56.671 --> 00:18:57.260
<v Speaker 4>that's good.</v>

849
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 4>It's me and a,</v>

850
00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.660
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a Hank Williams,</v>

851
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:02.710
<v Speaker 4>the third shirt that I'm wearing there.</v>

852
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:04.763
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to tell.</v>

853
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:05.770
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing,</v>

854
00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.780
<v Speaker 4>the fact that people still worry about Satan is just,</v>

855
00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:11.850
<v Speaker 4>you want to just say calm down.</v>

856
00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.530
<v Speaker 4>He's not a problem.</v>

857
00:19:13.531 --> 00:19:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Cause he doesn't exist just like your God.</v>

858
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

859
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:17.461
<v Speaker 4>they both air you.</v>

860
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:20.220
<v Speaker 4>The people listening right now that just took their earphones off and threw them</v>

861
00:19:20.221 --> 00:19:21.054
<v Speaker 4>across the room.</v>

862
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.193
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

863
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.850
<v Speaker 4>I can hear cut for 30 times you say to that.</v>

864
00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:27.613
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

865
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:33.150
<v Speaker 4>just that you know whether or not God exists is a fascinating point of</v>

866
00:19:33.151 --> 00:19:33.720
<v Speaker 4>discussion.</v>

867
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 4>But what's interesting is,</v>

868
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:39.900
<v Speaker 4>is this agreement that people say when they decide that God exists and you</v>

869
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:42.210
<v Speaker 4>decide that God exists and I decided to,</v>

870
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:42.750
<v Speaker 4>God exists.</v>

871
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:47.430
<v Speaker 4>So we both have agreed that there's this weird thing that makes no sense that</v>

872
00:19:47.431 --> 00:19:48.480
<v Speaker 4>we're on board with.</v>

873
00:19:48.481 --> 00:19:50.880
<v Speaker 4>So I know where you stand on a lot of issues.</v>

874
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:51.940
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

875
00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:53.970
<v Speaker 4>I probably know where you stand on abortion.</v>

876
00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:55.800
<v Speaker 4>I probably know where you stand on guns.</v>

877
00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:57.780
<v Speaker 4>I probably know where you stand on climate change.</v>

878
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like he gets so weird little thing that you do when you say that,</v>

879
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.341
<v Speaker 4>you know when you say,</v>

880
00:20:02.341 --> 00:20:02.800
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

881
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.200
<v Speaker 4>you know I'm a god fearing Christian.</v>

882
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.063
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

883
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:05.491
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

884
00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:05.671
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

885
00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:06.660
<v Speaker 4>I can predict you better.</v>

886
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:07.250
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

887
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.400
<v Speaker 4>I swear it's like you're off.</v>

888
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 4>You're all wearing the same decoder ring.</v>

889
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

890
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.543
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

891
00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.170
<v Speaker 4>Well that is what a lot of it is.</v>

892
00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.900
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it is whether or not you believe in God or not.</v>

893
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.180
<v Speaker 4>It's the saying that God's real and the worshiping God and the talking about</v>

894
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:21.810
<v Speaker 4>God.</v>

895
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 4>It's just letting everybody know that they can predict.</v>

896
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:24.714
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

897
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.030
<v Speaker 4>they know where you kind of like if you're a gentleman,</v>

898
00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:27.721
<v Speaker 4>if you're a gentleman,</v>

899
00:20:27.721 --> 00:20:30.960
<v Speaker 4>you wearing a tie with a nice suit on and pair of pants,</v>

900
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:36.140
<v Speaker 4>I can fairly likely predict that you're going to be reasonably behaved.</v>

901
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

902
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.973
<v Speaker 4>you're a gentlemen.</v>

903
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:38.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

904
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.630
<v Speaker 4>if you're a Christian,</v>

905
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.930
<v Speaker 4>if you're a person who calls himself a Christian and you know,</v>

906
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.140
<v Speaker 4>well we go to the Bible,</v>

907
00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.840
<v Speaker 4>go to church every Sunday and uh,</v>

908
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to read the Bible and I am a Christian</v>

909
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 3>and people automatically go,</v>

910
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:49.321
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

911
00:20:49.321 --> 00:20:49.691
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

912
00:20:49.691 --> 00:20:50.920
<v Speaker 3>I kind of know where you're coming from.</v>

913
00:20:50.921 --> 00:20:51.221
<v Speaker 3>I can,</v>

914
00:20:51.221 --> 00:20:52.390
<v Speaker 3>I can see where you are.</v>

915
00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.600
<v Speaker 3>And now I like that you can predict to me,</v>

916
00:20:55.601 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 3>cause you will like me better so we don't have to talk.</v>

917
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

918
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.830
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

919
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:59.150
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

920
00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Now reinforce those,</v>

921
00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.140
<v Speaker 3>those patterns in your head.</v>

922
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.140
<v Speaker 3>And I'll say some things that,</v>

923
00:21:04.141 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

924
00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.960
<v Speaker 3>I've repeated things that I've heard other people say about God and Jesus and</v>

925
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

926
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:10.930
<v Speaker 3>And it's a nice way to kill time.</v>

927
00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:12.190
<v Speaker 3>It's not a bad way,</v>

928
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

929
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:14.430
<v Speaker 3>believing in God and going to church and state,</v>

930
00:21:14.431 --> 00:21:14.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a great,</v>

931
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.710
<v Speaker 3>you killed time until death nullifies all meaning.</v>

932
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:18.041
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

933
00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 3>I think the community thing of it is a good day.</v>

934
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.281
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

935
00:21:21.281 --> 00:21:21.940
<v Speaker 3>there's some,</v>

936
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 3>there's some really powerful like bonding experiences that people have when they</v>

937
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.510
<v Speaker 3>agreed to be humbled together.</v>

938
00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

939
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

940
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:30.670
<v Speaker 3>you're describing curling,</v>

941
00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:32.111
<v Speaker 3>curling,</v>

942
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:32.944
<v Speaker 3>curling.</v>

943
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Another great look.</v>

944
00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:39.220
<v Speaker 3>See Words in Canada are very popular.</v>

945
00:21:39.221 --> 00:21:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Countering,</v>

946
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.900
<v Speaker 3>curling.</v>

947
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

948
00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:40.660
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

949
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:43.330
<v Speaker 3>And there's no way he's curling is one of the top TV.</v>

950
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:47.260
<v Speaker 3>And you cannot rise to the tops of curling without humbling yourself.</v>

951
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Cause you humble yourself the minute you say,</v>

952
00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like go curly when you pick up that brush and a big smile on your face</v>

953
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.931
<v Speaker 3>side to sweep.</v>

954
00:21:53.931 --> 00:21:54.090
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

955
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:54.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

956
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:54.971
<v Speaker 3>I'm tried.</v>

957
00:21:54.971 --> 00:21:55.481
<v Speaker 3>Curling man.</v>

958
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:56.080
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy.</v>

959
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

960
00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:56.960
<v Speaker 3>it's hard.</v>

961
00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.270
<v Speaker 3>Which still doesn't make it a sport.</v>

962
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.050
<v Speaker 3>I made fun of it in Newfoundland and they fucking got so mad at me.</v>

963
00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.533
<v Speaker 3>Wanna curling.</v>

964
00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.600
<v Speaker 3>He'll read a theater where I was at like how these pictures of curlers on the</v>

965
00:22:07.601 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 3>wall and I just could not stop shitting on them yet.</v>

966
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.580
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

967
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:11.520
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

968
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:12.611
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

969
00:22:12.611 --> 00:22:14.050
<v Speaker 3>there were legitimately upset.</v>

970
00:22:14.051 --> 00:22:14.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

971
00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.330
<v Speaker 3>it is a preposterous endeavor.</v>

972
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

973
00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.101
<v Speaker 3>You know in,</v>

974
00:22:17.101 --> 00:22:17.591
<v Speaker 3>and I know it,</v>

975
00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:19.270
<v Speaker 3>you're sliding a rock on the ice.</v>

976
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Used to be a reason to drink.</v>

977
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 3>That's what curling was,</v>

978
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:23.130
<v Speaker 3>where everybody would get together,</v>

979
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:27.670
<v Speaker 3>still is wasted and you don't fall very far on the ice because we're already</v>

980
00:22:27.671 --> 00:22:28.170
<v Speaker 3>squatting.</v>

981
00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:28.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

982
00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:28.980
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

983
00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

984
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.150
<v Speaker 3>And the other people are leaning against brooms.</v>

985
00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:31.541
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

986
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:32.560
<v Speaker 3>You got a broom to lean against.</v>

987
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:33.940
<v Speaker 3>It's great you're drinking.</v>

988
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.650
<v Speaker 3>It's also like when you fall on ice,</v>

989
00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:36.700
<v Speaker 3>it's almost always funny.</v>

990
00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:37.920
<v Speaker 3>Always.</v>

991
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

992
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:38.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

993
00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:39.490
<v Speaker 3>No one's,</v>

994
00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.440
<v Speaker 3>no one ever catches himself.</v>

995
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.880
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

996
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.200
<v Speaker 3>You don't like gently fall.</v>

997
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.280
<v Speaker 3>You could try and get up as good to you.</v>

998
00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Don't fall elegantly on ice.</v>

999
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 3>You can even go hiking and slip a little and catch yourself in that.</v>

1000
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:53.440
<v Speaker 3>But even like when you're watching the NHL and you'll see players that will just</v>

1001
00:22:53.441 --> 00:22:54.100
<v Speaker 3>fall down.</v>

1002
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:54.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1003
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.600
<v Speaker 3>Like just for no reason.</v>

1004
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:56.380
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

1005
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.820
<v Speaker 3>These are the best skaters in the world,</v>

1006
00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.530
<v Speaker 3>and they're just going to fall down on his ass.</v>

1007
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:01.100
<v Speaker 3>He's a professional airplane.</v>

1008
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:01.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:02.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1010
00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:05.590
<v Speaker 3>And like if I ran with it Volkswagen,</v>

1011
00:23:05.591 --> 00:23:06.670
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't knock him over.</v>

1012
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.450
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1013
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.350
<v Speaker 3>But he just fell.</v>

1014
00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.510
<v Speaker 3>How long has curling been around?</v>

1015
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.640
<v Speaker 3>Hundreds old.</v>

1016
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:12.670
<v Speaker 3>It's a Scottish court.</v>

1017
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a Scottish spot where they used to use actual rocks they'd find in fields</v>

1018
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.050
<v Speaker 3>and play it on frozen lakes.</v>

1019
00:23:18.051 --> 00:23:18.670
<v Speaker 3>The lakes,</v>

1020
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.710
<v Speaker 3>because that's the only kind they have in Scotland.</v>

1021
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1022
00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Are frozen ones and the lochness monster can around.</v>

1023
00:23:25.330 --> 00:23:26.050
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of,</v>

1024
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.220
<v Speaker 3>he's a wonderful curler.</v>

1025
00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.211
<v Speaker 3>David,</v>

1026

1033
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 3>so you can see what curling would be popular,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's strange.</v>

1038
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:45.550
<v Speaker 3>That's why there's so many gourds and Craig's or it ain't that Johnson Gordon</v>

1039
00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:46.250
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

1042
00:23:47.001 --> 00:23:48.360
<v Speaker 2>That would be a Scottish word,</v>

1043
00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:48.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1044

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1047
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:52.370
<v Speaker 2>and of course because of Gordie Howe,</v>

1048
00:23:52.371 --> 00:23:53.510
<v Speaker 2>everyone named their kids.</v>

1049
00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:54.170
<v Speaker 2>Gord.</v>

1050
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.140
<v Speaker 2>I went to school with a guy named Greg [inaudible].</v>

1051
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was his first name.</v>

1052
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:01.700
<v Speaker 2>Greg or Greg or I know a guy named Greg or Gregory Gillespie fights in the UFC</v>

1053
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.673
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

1054
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.761
<v Speaker 2>I haven't kind of,</v>

1055
00:24:04.761 --> 00:24:05.594
<v Speaker 2>Gregor,</v>

1056
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.460
<v Speaker 2>probably it's a savage.</v>

1057
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Can I just give one interesting UFC memory for me please?</v>

1058

<v Speaker 2>I watched the very first UFC one a with,</v>

1059
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:20.000
<v Speaker 2>I had a trip at the time and we invited scout troop and it wasn't,</v>

1063
00:24:24.891 --> 00:24:27.650
<v Speaker 2>It was 20 years old at the time he was in town.</v>

1064
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 2>We just met him and he came over and soon as the sumo wrestler,</v>

1065
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Speaker 2>God has face kicked in and there's spit a tooth out,</v>

1066
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

1067
00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:36.981

1068
00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:37.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm Outta here.</v>

1070
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.940
<v Speaker 2>And we made him stay and watch the whole thing.</v>

1071
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Good for you.</v>

1072
00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 2>And that's what made him gay.</v>

1073
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.771

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.690
<v Speaker 2>she's the one who wasn't willing to let go.</v>

1135
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1136
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.170

1143
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:11.840
<v Speaker 2>When they were divorced,</v>

1144
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:13.093
<v Speaker 2>divorced.</v>

1145
00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 2>They would go as a together and we get all our family trips.</v>

1146
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.851
<v Speaker 2>Did they,</v>

1147
00:26:16.851 --> 00:26:18.890
<v Speaker 2>did all family tree the whole table together?</v>

1148
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.170
<v Speaker 2>Well the first two years we weren't that we didn't do much.</v>

1149
00:26:21.171 --> 00:26:21.351
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1150
00:26:21.351 --> 00:26:22.950
<v Speaker 2>Those are the dark years.</v>

1151
00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:24.510
<v Speaker 2>The dark.</v>

1152
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1153
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.880
<v Speaker 2>But then uh,</v>

1154
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:26.061
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1155
00:26:26.061 --> 00:26:26.571
<v Speaker 2>then yeah,</v>

1156
00:26:26.571 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 2>that's why we have kept me in all of our family trips together.</v>

1157
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:29.870
<v Speaker 2>We go to Hawaii.</v>

1158
00:26:29.871 --> 00:26:30.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like they were still married.</v>

1159
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 2>And so when we finally did get back together it was really just so,</v>

1161
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:37.700
<v Speaker 2>it was mostly about the convenience of our friends.</v>

1162
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.440
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

1163
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1164
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.900
<v Speaker 2>this is going to make everyone else's life easier.</v>

1165
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:43.170
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1166
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:43.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1167
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:43.831

1171
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1172

<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

1183
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.050
<v Speaker 3>that's the only time you've ever been married,</v>

1184
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:01.640
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1185
00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:02.610
<v Speaker 3>Thank the baby Jesus.</v>

1186
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.121
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1187
00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:03.954
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1188
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.043
<v Speaker 3>Praise Jesus.</v>

1189
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Done that.</v>

1190
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It's working.</v>

1191
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:08.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1192
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.740
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1193
00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.470
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

1194
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1195
00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.531
<v Speaker 3>If it works,</v>

1197
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:11.250
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

1198
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:11.971
<v Speaker 3>I always tell people,</v>

1200
00:27:11.971 --> 00:27:12.510
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

1201
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:13.343
<v Speaker 3>It's too risky.</v>

1202
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1203
00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:14.850
<v Speaker 3>You could.</v>

1204
00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 3>50% of the people don't make it.</v>

1205
00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:16.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1206
00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:16.991
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1207
00:27:16.991 --> 00:27:17.250
<v Speaker 3>it's uh,</v>

1208
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:18.240
<v Speaker 3>it's not a good,</v>

1209
00:27:18.241 --> 00:27:20.730
<v Speaker 3>a good rate of success.</v>

1210
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Would you drive a car if you knew that 50% likely you would die in a crash,</v>

1211
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:25.440
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1212
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1213
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.311
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1214
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:29.340
<v Speaker 3>it was an institution that made sense when you're only going to live to be 40</v>

1215
00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 3>sweat.</v>

1216
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.781
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1217
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense.</v>

1218
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 3>There's some parts of it that makes sense.</v>

1219
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:36.690
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that it's become a business and it's become a business for people</v>

1220
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:38.220
<v Speaker 3>to try to squeeze is like,</v>

1221
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.750
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget trying to talk,</v>

1222
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:41.070
<v Speaker 3>fill in and getting divorced.</v>

1223
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1224
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:42.091
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

1225
00:27:42.091 --> 00:27:42.960
<v Speaker 3>just give her half.</v>

1226
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

1227
00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:44.603
<v Speaker 3>it's not half.</v>

1228
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.570
<v Speaker 3>It's two thirds.</v>

1229
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a scam.</v>

1230
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.090
<v Speaker 3>The fucking lawyers get a third.</v>

1231
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:48.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1232
00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:52.320
<v Speaker 3>He gave away two thirds and then he was fucking freaking out about it.</v>

1233
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:53.431
<v Speaker 3>And it's true.</v>

1234
00:27:53.431 --> 00:27:54.990
<v Speaker 3>And he could've lived nicely on the third.</v>

1235
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 3>He should have given her that.</v>

1236
00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:58.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that,</v>

1237
00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1238
00:27:58.530 --> 00:27:59.790
<v Speaker 3>the word was that,</v>

1239
00:27:59.791 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 3>that's why she killed him,</v>

1240
00:28:01.021 --> 00:28:02.070
<v Speaker 3>that he was leaving,</v>

1241
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:02.941
<v Speaker 3>that that was,</v>

1242
00:28:02.941 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 3>he was finally leaving,</v>

1243
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.240
<v Speaker 3>and then that's when she killed him.</v>

1244
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.360
<v Speaker 3>But when we were together with him,</v>

1245
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.340
<v Speaker 3>there was always days where he would come to the set and just be just in hell.</v>

1246
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.121
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1247
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:15.750
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1248
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.991
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1249
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 3>And he wouldn't well be,</v>

1250
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:21.210
<v Speaker 3>he'd just be on the floor of the studio and like ranting.</v>

1251
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.020
<v Speaker 3>About,</v>

1253
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:22.381
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

1254
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:22.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1255
00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm living in my boat and he lived in his boat.</v>

1256
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:27.181
<v Speaker 3>It was rough,</v>

1257
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:28.014
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1258
00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.180
<v Speaker 3>And then he would come back like a day later and it'd be,</v>

1259
00:28:30.181 --> 00:28:30.271
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1260
00:28:30.271 --> 00:28:32.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm back together with my blushing bride.</v>

1261
00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:33.870
<v Speaker 3>That's exact quote.</v>

1262
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1263
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:36.620
<v Speaker 3>And we can the exact quote and we'd all just be going,</v>

1264
00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:38.730
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

1265
00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.760
<v Speaker 3>it was poor bastard.</v>

1266
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.800
<v Speaker 3>Although none of the weird thing of news,</v>

1267
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:42.991
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1268
00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:44.640
<v Speaker 3>There was not one good marriage on the show.</v>

1269
00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:45.420
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1270
00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:48.090
<v Speaker 3>like everyone was going through a terrible marriage at the time.</v>

1271
00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Like I was proud that it was one person who wasn't on antidepressants.</v>

1272
00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.520
<v Speaker 3>Super psyched about that.</v>

1273
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:56.880
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't on any pills and I wasn't in therapy,</v>

1274
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.200
<v Speaker 3>but I probably needed it.</v>

1275
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:00.963
<v Speaker 3>I think we all did.</v>

1276
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1277
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:02.130
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1278
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean I remember you started with,</v>

1279
00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.200
<v Speaker 3>I can just this second season we came back and Steve Route had gotten divorced</v>

1280
00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:08.610
<v Speaker 3>and he was the first one.</v>

1281
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:10.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1282
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:14.620
<v Speaker 3>I think everyone free to be me or Phil would get divorced for us.</v>

1283
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Steven Mora.</v>

1284
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:17.640
<v Speaker 3>But Steve,</v>

1285
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1286
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.620
<v Speaker 3>We didn't know how bad it was for Steve.</v>

1287
00:29:19.621 --> 00:29:21.030
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's hard up there.</v>

1288
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:24.580
<v Speaker 3>Tarred Todd to make it hard,</v>

1289
00:29:24.581 --> 00:29:26.010
<v Speaker 3>hard for people sit together.</v>

1290
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:27.030
<v Speaker 3>It'd be nice to each other.</v>

1291
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1292
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:28.673
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1293
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1294
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.701
<v Speaker 3>It takes,</v>

1295
00:29:29.701 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 3>does they say it takes work,</v>

1296
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 3>but it actually takes work.</v>

1297
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1298
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.450
<v Speaker 3>it does take work.</v>

1299
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Your way to wait until you are an adult too is good.</v>

1300
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Good move.</v>

1301
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1302
00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 3>Most people get married before they're adults.</v>

1303
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:39.661
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1304
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:41.620
<v Speaker 3>I think you should wait until you know who the fuck you are.</v>

1305
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:42.101
<v Speaker 3>And it's still,</v>

1306
00:29:42.101 --> 00:29:42.970
<v Speaker 3>I'm still guessing.</v>

1307
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1308
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:44.321
<v Speaker 3>Even to this day,</v>

1309
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:45.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing who I am.</v>

1310
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:50.290
<v Speaker 3>Literally my dad almost on his death bed told me don't do it.</v>

1311
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.290
<v Speaker 3>You can't get married until you're 30 that's a good move.</v>

1312
00:29:53.291 --> 00:29:54.540
<v Speaker 3>It's demanded that he,</v>

1313
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.653
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

1314
00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.810
<v Speaker 3>I haven't got married at 30 but he was like,</v>

1315
00:29:58.811 --> 00:29:59.644
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

1316
00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 3>Don't do it before 30 cause you don't know who you are.</v>

1317
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.510
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what's going on.</v>

1318
00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Well that I've seen too many predatory marriages.</v>

1319
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.610
<v Speaker 3>I've seen women marry men that don't really like,</v>

1320
00:30:09.611 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 3>because they know the man has money.</v>

1321
00:30:10.871 --> 00:30:11.704
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen,</v>

1322
00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.150
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the opposite.</v>

1323
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 3>It's just such a weird thing when you enter into contractual agreement about</v>

1324
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:18.904
<v Speaker 3>romance.</v>

1325
00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:19.631
<v Speaker 3>Like it's,</v>

1326
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:19.920
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1327
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.120
<v Speaker 3>it's not just I love you,</v>

1328
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:22.811
<v Speaker 3>you love me,</v>

1329
00:30:22.811 --> 00:30:23.410
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

1330
00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 3>let's have a celebration of our love and let's invite our friends over and tell</v>

1331
00:30:27.041 --> 00:30:27.874
<v Speaker 3>everybody we've,</v>

1332
00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.940
<v Speaker 3>we've decided to engage each other in this very special commitment.</v>

1333
00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 3>But then you start bringing in lawyers.</v>

1334
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:36.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1335
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:36.790
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1336
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.960
<v Speaker 3>And then it gets weird.</v>

1337
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:38.561
<v Speaker 3>And then you know,</v>

1338
00:30:38.561 --> 00:30:43.561
<v Speaker 3>you have weird state by state laws where there's common law marriages.</v>

1339
00:30:45.251 --> 00:30:47.380
<v Speaker 3>If you live with someone for 10 years,</v>

1340
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:51.160
<v Speaker 3>and that might've been where humanity went wrong was when the first guys said,</v>

1341
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:52.810
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be a lawyer.</v>

1342
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Like that was his decision.</v>

1343
00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.890
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking around and to think,</v>

1344
00:30:57.010 --> 00:30:57.843
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1345
00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.470
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of ugliness in the world.</v>

1346
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1347
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:00.990
<v Speaker 3>What was the work on?</v>

1348
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.900
<v Speaker 3>It was the first lawyer like was the,</v>

1349
00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.330
<v Speaker 3>there's a series of laws,</v>

1350
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:04.751
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1351
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:06.250
<v Speaker 3>The first lawyers had to have been priests,</v>

1352
00:31:06.251 --> 00:31:07.084
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1353
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:07.751
<v Speaker 3>I would guess so.</v>

1354
00:31:07.751 --> 00:31:08.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1355
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean the law is a Ferris initially we're,</v>

1356
00:31:10.621 --> 00:31:11.800
<v Speaker 3>we're basically lawyers,</v>

1357
00:31:11.801 --> 00:31:12.490
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1358
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:13.323
<v Speaker 3>What does a Pharisee,</v>

1359
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:13.990
<v Speaker 3>the Jewish,</v>

1360
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.780
<v Speaker 3>the Jewish priests makes sense.</v>

1361
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:18.160
<v Speaker 3>That does make a lot of sense.</v>

1362
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:19.023
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1363
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.920
<v Speaker 3>A lot of my relatives.</v>

1364
00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1365
00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:22.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1366
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:27.160
<v Speaker 3>Like when did it become a thing where it was you would go to law school and it</v>

1367
00:31:27.161 --> 00:31:27.600
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1368
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1369
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:33.040
<v Speaker 3>a respectable occupation and it would be good to know a good lawyer.</v>

1370
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:34.203
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1371
00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.720
<v Speaker 3>I think those things started out as not respectable and people did them cause</v>

1372
00:31:41.111 --> 00:31:44.170
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have any other like choice.</v>

1373
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.310
<v Speaker 3>And again,</v>

1374
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.960
<v Speaker 3>they realized all their making all the money,</v>

1375
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.423
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1376
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:49.930
<v Speaker 3>and then it became respectable.</v>

1377
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1378
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:55.430
<v Speaker 3>once they figured out there's all those legal ease and loopholes in the system</v>

1379
00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:57.250
<v Speaker 3>is ways to extract money.</v>

1380
00:31:57.300 --> 00:31:57.680
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1381
00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.480
<v Speaker 3>You just gotta be weasley about it and then they invent a whole language to</v>

1382
00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:03.310
<v Speaker 3>exclude anyone else from understanding it.</v>

1383
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:03.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1384
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:05.620
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they billed hourly back then?</v>

1385
00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:06.933
<v Speaker 3>Still?</v>

1386
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:07.271
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1387
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:07.871
<v Speaker 3>But then again,</v>

1388
00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:09.250
<v Speaker 3>time hadn't been codified,</v>

1389
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.761
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1390
00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:11.050
<v Speaker 3>so what did they built by an hour?</v>

1391
00:32:11.051 --> 00:32:13.150
<v Speaker 3>It was basically decided by community standards.</v>

1392
00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1393
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 3>when was time codified?</v>

1394
00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:15.970
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1395
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:17.080
<v Speaker 3>when the railroads came in.</v>

1396
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.533
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

1397
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:20.830
<v Speaker 3>Well that's when,</v>

1398
00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:22.240
<v Speaker 3>that's when time zones were created.</v>

1399
00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.700
<v Speaker 3>The time zones were created by the railroads.</v>

1400
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:25.090
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1401
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's on a different time zone and every town,</v>

1402
00:32:27.611 --> 00:32:29.170
<v Speaker 3>every town said its own time.</v>

1403
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:30.250
<v Speaker 3>Like wow.</v>

1404
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:30.851
<v Speaker 3>Like you could have,</v>

1405
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:31.684
<v Speaker 3>you could drive,</v>

1406
00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:33.330
<v Speaker 3>you could drive from like,</v>

1407
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:34.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1408
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.330
<v Speaker 3>from Denver to Fort Collins and the two cities would be completely different</v>

1409
00:32:37.331 --> 00:32:38.080
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>

1410
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:38.710
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1411
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:41.240
<v Speaker 3>And how you sync up your watch with the town clock?</v>

1412
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.100
<v Speaker 3>You have the clock in the main square and that'll be all the time.</v>

1414
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:44.950
<v Speaker 3>That's the time.</v>

1415
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.180
<v Speaker 3>But when they started having to schedule railroads,</v>

1416
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:47.961
<v Speaker 3>they realized,</v>

1417
00:32:47.961 --> 00:32:48.500
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1418
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:48.771
<v Speaker 3>Huh,</v>

1419
00:32:48.771 --> 00:32:49.490
<v Speaker 3>all these towns.</v>

1420
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:54.290
<v Speaker 3>And then they started having huge competitions to invent ways of synchronizing</v>

1421
00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:56.620
<v Speaker 3>clocks between cities and that,</v>

1422
00:32:56.621 --> 00:32:59.210
<v Speaker 3>did they use a sun dial to get the initial reading?</v>

1423
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:04.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it really was just a simple as we'll call this midnight or we'll call</v>

1424
00:33:04.821 --> 00:33:05.610
<v Speaker 3>this noon,</v>

1425
00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:05.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1426
00:33:05.971 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 3>and then he just went from there and none of the clocks were that accurate.</v>

1427
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.970
<v Speaker 3>So time would shift over time.</v>

1428
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:11.901
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1429
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:12.141
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1430
00:33:12.141 --> 00:33:12.974
<v Speaker 3>it became,</v>

1431
00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:18.240
<v Speaker 3>that was like in like the 19th century was a huge move to try and find a way to</v>

1432
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:19.610
<v Speaker 3>synchronize clocks.</v>

1433
00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.533
<v Speaker 3>And that drove,</v>

1434
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 3>kind of drove a lot of the beginnings of technology.</v>

1435
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:27.170
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when you were a kid you would call phone number to get the time?</v>

1436
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.140
<v Speaker 3>Always say yes for sure the exact time.</v>

1437
00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:31.430
<v Speaker 3>The weather as well sometimes.</v>

1438
00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:32.503
<v Speaker 3>But the time,</v>

1439
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:37.750
<v Speaker 3>the time is exactly four 59 and 35 seconds.</v>

1440
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1441
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:43.090
<v Speaker 3>and in Canada at one o'clock every day they had the national time tone right at</v>

1442
00:33:45.411 --> 00:33:48.400
<v Speaker 3>this essential and of the long beep it will be exactly one PR,</v>

1443
00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:49.253
<v Speaker 3>radio and TV.</v>

1444
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Why 1:00 PM?</v>

1445
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:51.283
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why,</v>

1446
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.491
<v Speaker 3>but it has.</v>

1447
00:33:52.491 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 3>When they would do it at 1:00 PM every day,</v>

1448
00:33:54.081 --> 00:33:54.930
<v Speaker 3>the CBC would,</v>

1449
00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:56.360
<v Speaker 3>would broadcast a tone</v>

1450
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 3>and that was the time for the whole country.</v>

1451
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1452
00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:04.700
<v Speaker 3>I never would've guessed that time zones are created by the railroads.</v>

1453
00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:05.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1454
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:06.290
<v Speaker 3>but it totally makes sense.</v>

1455
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Have a schedule without,</v>

1456
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:08.563
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1457
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Because before that nobody went anywhere.</v>

1458
00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:11.811
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1459
00:34:11.811 --> 00:34:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Arizona's still doesn't do daylight savings time.</v>

1460
00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:15.561
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

1461
00:34:15.561 --> 00:34:16.580
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>

1462
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.713
<v Speaker 3>That's stupid.</v>

1463
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.553
<v Speaker 3>They're allowed to do that.</v>

1464
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.010
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1465
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1466
00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1467
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1468
00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.290
<v Speaker 3>If you drive from like if you drive from Nevada to Arizona,</v>

1469
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:25.131
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1470
00:34:25.131 --> 00:34:25.431
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1471
00:34:25.431 --> 00:34:26.330
<v Speaker 3>you miss an hour.</v>

1472
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1473
00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.021
<v Speaker 3>The act.</v>

1474
00:34:27.021 --> 00:34:27.531
<v Speaker 3>The only state.</v>

1475
00:34:27.531 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there another state that doesn't,</v>

1476
00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:29.380
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>

1477
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.470
<v Speaker 3>I think no one I'm aware of.</v>

1478
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.110
<v Speaker 3>Is there a wide why Hawaii?</v>

1479
00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.080
<v Speaker 3>They're an island.</v>

1480
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:37.460
<v Speaker 3>We stole Hawaii.</v>

1481
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1482
00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.450
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1483
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:40.100
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't that island is theirs.</v>

1484
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:40.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1485
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:40.671
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

1486
00:34:40.671 --> 00:34:43.730
<v Speaker 3>that's a fucking country that we occupy with hotels.</v>

1487
00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.460
<v Speaker 3>It's own feeling.</v>

1488
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:48.080
<v Speaker 3>The rest of it was given to us by God.</v>

1489
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:48.871
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1490
00:34:48.871 --> 00:34:49.191
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1491
00:34:49.191 --> 00:34:50.090
<v Speaker 3>It's manifest destiny.</v>

1492
00:34:50.091 --> 00:34:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>

1493
00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:50.780
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1494
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.613
<v Speaker 3>The rest of it,</v>

1495
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:52.580
<v Speaker 3>but not Hawaii.</v>

1496
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:52.940
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1497
00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.900
<v Speaker 3>Cause that came less late.</v>

1498
00:34:54.390 --> 00:34:54.900
<v Speaker 3>It was late.</v>

1499
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:55.161
<v Speaker 3>The game.</v>

1500
00:34:55.161 --> 00:35:00.161
<v Speaker 3>There's no single co like there's no state where the people are so clearly like</v>

1501
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:03.830
<v Speaker 3>their ethnicity is so clearly defined.</v>

1502
00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.670
<v Speaker 3>They're Polynesian looking at both the lay,</v>

1503
00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.790
<v Speaker 3>their culture,</v>

1504
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:12.210
<v Speaker 3>North Dakota or fucking Florida or some shit.</v>

1505
00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:16.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're not from the European heritage.</v>

1506
00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:16.490
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1507
00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:16.641
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1508
00:35:16.641 --> 00:35:16.881
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1509
00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:17.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1510
00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:21.500
<v Speaker 3>there's an interesting debate going on about what is ne or California moves</v>

1511
00:35:21.501 --> 00:35:23.120
<v Speaker 3>towards permanent daylight savings time.</v>

1512
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:24.873
<v Speaker 3>It's not your land</v>

1513
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:27.831
<v Speaker 3>every day.</v>

1514
00:35:27.831 --> 00:35:30.140
<v Speaker 3>We get to get up an hour early every day.</v>

1515
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Earlier and earlier and earlier and earlier.</v>

1516
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.680
<v Speaker 3>I already of Arizona's on permanent standard time and the year lown daylight</v>

1517
00:35:37.681 --> 00:35:41.220
<v Speaker 3>savings times followed by Hawaiian and the territories of the American Samoa.</v>

1518
00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:41.701
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1519
00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Guam and minor outlying islands.</v>

1520
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:46.670
<v Speaker 3>While I say California,</v>

1521
00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:51.720
<v Speaker 3>let's be really bold and go for permanent daylight look like a white Alaska,</v>

1522
00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.311
<v Speaker 3>Alaska.</v>

1523
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:53.911
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1524
00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1525
00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:54.770
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1526
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 3>It's just give up on night.</v>

1527
00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:56.731
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1528
00:35:56.731 --> 00:35:59.430
<v Speaker 3>and then just everybody wants to kill themselves when it's nighttime there.</v>

1529
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:03.870
<v Speaker 3>There's an interesting debate going on in Hawaii right now as to what is an</v>

1530
00:36:03.871 --> 00:36:08.871
<v Speaker 3>invasive species because so much of the wildlife in Hawaii was brought over and</v>

1531
00:36:11.881 --> 00:36:12.691
<v Speaker 3>so there's,</v>

1532
00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:16.170
<v Speaker 3>there's some debate on certain islands where they want to eliminate the wild</v>

1533
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:20.310
<v Speaker 3>pigs because they say they're an invasive species and then the people are</v>

1534
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:20.551
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>

1535
00:36:20.551 --> 00:36:25.260
<v Speaker 3>but we'll hold on because we kind of came after a lot of these wild pigs.</v>

1536
00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of the wild pigs were dropped off by pirates,</v>

1537
00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.590
<v Speaker 3>like carrots and,</v>

1538
00:36:29.591 --> 00:36:33.780
<v Speaker 3>and people that were in a boating like that were traveling by boat across the</v>

1539
00:36:33.781 --> 00:36:34.110
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1540
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:37.260
<v Speaker 3>They would drop off goats and pigs on various islands,</v>

1541
00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 3>so they would have something to hunt when they would come back for food because</v>

1542
00:36:40.921 --> 00:36:43.140
<v Speaker 3>they knew that this would be a stop along their route,</v>

1543
00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:44.963
<v Speaker 3>which is clever.</v>

1544
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.193
<v Speaker 3>It is clever.</v>

1545
00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.700
<v Speaker 3>It ruined a lot of islands,</v>

1546
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.680
<v Speaker 3>especially the goats.</v>

1547
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:49.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1548
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.310
<v Speaker 3>Destroyed a lot of islands.</v>

1549
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I just ate it.</v>

1550
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:54.030
<v Speaker 3>And now in Hawaii there's a lot of mongoose.</v>

1551
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

1552
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1553
00:36:55.111 --> 00:36:57.050
<v Speaker 3>They brought Mongoose and at some point I forget what it was,</v>

1554
00:36:57.051 --> 00:36:57.271
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1555
00:36:57.271 --> 00:36:59.030
<v Speaker 3>was to control the rabbit population.</v>

1556
00:36:59.031 --> 00:36:59.851
<v Speaker 3>That was probably where the rats,</v>

1557
00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:02.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it was to control that as they came in from again,</v>

1558
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:04.450
<v Speaker 3>from shipping and then the mongoose probably starting another.</v>

1559
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:04.980
<v Speaker 3>Anything else?</v>

1560
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:05.761
<v Speaker 3>Just all over the place.</v>

1561
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:06.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1562
00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Mongoose animals under the Alaska holiday and I made a joke about,</v>

1563
00:37:11.611 --> 00:37:11.941
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1564
00:37:11.941 --> 00:37:14.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm looking for beavers cause I didn't think there were beavers in Alaska</v>

1565
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:15.210
<v Speaker 3>because it's too cold.</v>

1566
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:18.450
<v Speaker 3>They said no last 10 years we've got tons of beavers here cause of global</v>

1567
00:37:18.451 --> 00:37:19.160
<v Speaker 3>warming.</v>

1568
00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Reelers everywhere.</v>

1569
00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1570
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:21.503
<v Speaker 3>they're moving.</v>

1571
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Beavers are migrating north.</v>

1572
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1573
00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Alaska is a fascinating place that you could go there for the summer.</v>

1574
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.801
<v Speaker 3>You go there in the summer,</v>

1575
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:31.980
<v Speaker 3>you have never seen more aggressive mosquitoes.</v>

1576
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.660
<v Speaker 3>It's like they know they only have two months to live and so you get out of your</v>

1577
00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:37.021
<v Speaker 3>car,</v>

1578
00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:37.920
<v Speaker 3>they swarm,</v>

1579
00:37:37.921 --> 00:37:38.940
<v Speaker 3>you look a cloud.</v>

1580
00:37:38.941 --> 00:37:39.721
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

1581
00:37:39.721 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like it in my life.</v>

1582
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.320
<v Speaker 3>You would think tropical weather,</v>

1583
00:37:43.321 --> 00:37:44.160
<v Speaker 3>that's where the mosquitoes.</v>

1584
00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1585
00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.690
<v Speaker 3>No Alaska.</v>

1586
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.450
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking ferocious and they're huge.</v>

1587
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:49.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1588
00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1589
00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:50.730
<v Speaker 3>I've never actually going to go there.</v>

1590
00:37:50.731 --> 00:37:51.870
<v Speaker 3>And then in November I think.</v>

1591
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:52.261
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1592
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:55.230
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing during the touring with a,</v>

1593
00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.310
<v Speaker 3>whose life anyway?</v>

1594
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.600
<v Speaker 3>It's like an Improv tour.</v>

1595
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.660
<v Speaker 3>So who's live anyway?</v>

1596
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Like a takeoff shoot.</v>

1597

00:38:16.561 --> 00:38:17.250
<v Speaker 3>and then there's a,</v>

1615
00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:17.790
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1616

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.300
<v Speaker 3>drew Carey and uh,</v>

1618
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.820
<v Speaker 3>and chip esten sort of rotate through,</v>

1619
00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:24.780
<v Speaker 3>likes it.</v>

1620
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.360
<v Speaker 3>The tour to carry might be the nicest person that's ever lived.</v>

1621
00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know him well.</v>

1622
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.790
<v Speaker 3>He might be the nicest guy ever.</v>

1623
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.320
<v Speaker 3>And it's nice he,</v>

1624
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:32.621
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1625
00:38:32.621 --> 00:38:35.280
<v Speaker 3>I remember it was the drew Carey show that finally got Newsradio canceled,</v>

1626
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:36.913
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1627
00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:37.720
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

1628
00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:37.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1629
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:39.470
<v Speaker 3>remember we did a whole year after that,</v>

1630
00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.050
<v Speaker 3>but I think that was what it was.</v>

1631
00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they wanted to do it anymore after that,</v>

1632
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.880
<v Speaker 3>but I think our waiters are ratings tanked when we,</v>

1633
00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:48.850
<v Speaker 3>when they put us up against true care or ratings are always shit.</v>

1634
00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1635
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.850
<v Speaker 3>That's the most amazing thing is that the ratings were really great.</v>

1636
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Once we got canceled and then it was on TV,</v>

1637
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.810
<v Speaker 3>like they would show the reruns.</v>

1638
00:38:55.811 --> 00:38:56.201
<v Speaker 3>So people go,</v>

1639
00:38:56.201 --> 00:38:56.291
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1640
00:38:56.291 --> 00:38:57.200
<v Speaker 3>this is a funny show.</v>

1641
00:38:57.201 --> 00:38:57.520
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1642
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.120
<v Speaker 3>they found it.</v>

1643
00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:58.720
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1644
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I remember Lou Morton,</v>

1645
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:00.311
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1646
00:39:00.311 --> 00:39:02.740
<v Speaker 3>one of our writers showing up at the huge show,</v>

1647
00:39:02.741 --> 00:39:07.060
<v Speaker 3>but the read table read the different number on his shirt every week when we</v>

1648
00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:08.950
<v Speaker 3>were in the real shit or when we're falling apart.</v>

1649
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.480
<v Speaker 3>The lowest number nine,</v>

1650
00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:12.790
<v Speaker 3>eight out of a hundred shows,</v>

1651
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.360
<v Speaker 3>eight was one day,</v>

1652
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.273
<v Speaker 3>no bullshit.</v>

1653
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:15.821

00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:16.811

00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:17.120

1658
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1659
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1660
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:19.241
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1661
00:39:19.241 --> 00:39:20.380
<v Speaker 3>you would draw it basically.</v>

1662
00:39:20.381 --> 00:39:21.850
<v Speaker 3>It basically a sweatshirt with a marker on it.</v>

1663
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious that he would just show up with this fucking number on his</v>

1664
00:39:25.121 --> 00:39:25.811
<v Speaker 3>shirt and I was like,</v>

1665
00:39:25.811 --> 00:39:26.610
<v Speaker 3>hey.</v>

1666
00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:26.951
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1667
00:39:26.951 --> 00:39:27.091
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1668
00:39:27.091 --> 00:39:30.490
<v Speaker 3>it's a source of pride when you can still be hanging on.</v>

1669
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.520
<v Speaker 3>One year that I thought we weren't going to get canceled was the year we got</v>

1670
00:39:33.521 --> 00:39:34.090
<v Speaker 3>canceled.</v>

1671
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:34.481
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1672
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:34.781
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1673
00:39:34.781 --> 00:39:35.614
<v Speaker 3>we're doing pretty good.</v>

1674
00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1675
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Well actually I have a ratings.</v>

1676
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:37.930
<v Speaker 3>We're all right.</v>

1677
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:38.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1678
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:39.380
<v Speaker 3>it's a five year show.</v>

1679
00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.213
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1680
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:42.910
<v Speaker 3>But much like the whole,</v>

1681
00:39:42.911 --> 00:39:45.250
<v Speaker 3>like we never really hit a hundred episodes.</v>

1682
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:49.060
<v Speaker 3>We got to like 97 97 because NBC didn't own it.</v>

1683
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.820
<v Speaker 3>So they did that with a bunch of shows they didn't own.</v>

1684
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 3>They do that on purpose for a year,</v>

1685
00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.410
<v Speaker 3>but four or five shows they cancelled at 97 episodes.</v>

1686
00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:57.071
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

1687
00:39:57.071 --> 00:39:57.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1688
00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:58.361
<v Speaker 3>Cause they,</v>

1689
00:39:58.361 --> 00:39:59.070
<v Speaker 3>cause there's,</v>

1690
00:39:59.070 --> 00:40:00.820
<v Speaker 3>it's a hundred it goes into syndication.</v>

1691
00:40:00.821 --> 00:40:01.291
<v Speaker 3>Is that right?</v>

1692
00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:02.124
<v Speaker 3>It used to be the rule.</v>

1693
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1694
00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.510

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.190
<v Speaker 3>anything doesn't really exist anymore.</v>

1696
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:09.880
<v Speaker 3>Well the weirdest one was the Charlie Sheen model that they did with that anger</v>

1697
00:40:09.881 --> 00:40:13.300

1699
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:18.850
<v Speaker 3>we order a hundred and they produced them all in the year.</v>

1700
00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.300

<v Speaker 3>Cause they just do the fingerprints.</v>

1758
00:41:44.331 --> 00:41:44.751
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

1759
00:41:44.751 --> 00:41:46.250
<v Speaker 3>And then they'd push it right into the line.</v>

1760
00:41:46.251 --> 00:41:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Sounded like venereal disease and nice people walk you.</v>

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.530
<v Speaker 3>clear not to pit Tsa pre with clear,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the nice people walk you all the way over to the,</v>

1765
00:41:57.170 --> 00:41:58.580
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

1766
00:41:58.780 --> 00:41:59.570
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

1767
00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:02.300
<v Speaker 3>the person you have the option of actually pissing on the people that you're</v>

1768
00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:05.110
<v Speaker 3>passing on their feet because they don't have any shoes on.</v>

1769
00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:05.511
<v Speaker 3>My God,</v>

1770
00:42:05.511 --> 00:42:06.231
<v Speaker 3>I have to get this.</v>

1771
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:07.064
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1772
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 3>that sounds fantastic.</v>

1773
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:08.924
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get that.</v>

1774
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:09.350
<v Speaker 3>But then it,</v>

1775
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:09.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1776
00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:10.760
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna go out to the company.</v>

1777
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:11.301
<v Speaker 3>You have to travel.</v>

1778
00:42:11.301 --> 00:42:12.660
<v Speaker 3>So no,</v>

1779
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.310
<v Speaker 3>not much.</v>

1780
00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:14.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean to Canada,</v>

1781
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:14.781
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't really matter.</v>

1782
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:15.614
<v Speaker 3>It's something country.</v>

1783
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1784
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:16.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1785
00:42:16.491 --> 00:42:17.660
<v Speaker 3>We will still in this country.</v>

1786
00:42:17.661 --> 00:42:18.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1787
00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Well you could always go through through the woods you had to Canada.</v>

1788
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

1789
00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:25.670
<v Speaker 3>People who taught border the border is a hundred a hundred yard clearcut is most</v>

1790
00:42:25.671 --> 00:42:28.610
<v Speaker 3>of the border with Canada is just a hundred yard clearcut and in the forest.</v>

1791
00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:30.110
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>

1792
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 3>it's actually cut cutting the trees down.</v>

1793
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:37.220
<v Speaker 3>It's like a hundred yards wide and that's the border all across.</v>

1794
00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:38.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not from what entity?</v>

1795
00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.153
<v Speaker 3>Natalie's it,</v>

1796
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.710
<v Speaker 3>it's actually easier to cross the border then the surrounding area.</v>

1797
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:43.071
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1798
00:42:43.071 --> 00:42:44.160
<v Speaker 3>Because the surrounding areas though.</v>

1799
00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:44.540
<v Speaker 3>Forest.</v>

1800
00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1801
00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:45.021
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1802
00:42:45.021 --> 00:42:45.530
<v Speaker 3>Do they,</v>

1803
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:47.600
<v Speaker 3>do they actually maintained that cut?</v>

1804
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1805
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1806
00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:48.770
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1807
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:53.390
<v Speaker 3>So every year someone's job is to cut down the trees for a hundred yard space</v>

1808
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:54.680
<v Speaker 3>between the United States and Canada.</v>

1809
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1810
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Why is most of the Canadian border just still that?</v>

1811
00:42:57.321 --> 00:42:57.890
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1812
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:59.510
<v Speaker 3>if you're a criminal and you cross here,</v>

1813
00:42:59.511 --> 00:43:00.830
<v Speaker 3>additional charges will apply.</v>

1814
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1815
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:02.690
<v Speaker 3>Cause now you've fled the country.</v>

1816
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:02.871
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1817
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:03.590
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen the,</v>

1818
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 3>you've seen the footage of,</v>

1819
00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 3>of refugees coming into Canada and the mounties meeting them and they were like,</v>

1820
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:10.221
<v Speaker 3>the mounties are just,</v>

1821
00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:13.460
<v Speaker 3>they're going now you understand that when you cross over here we will be</v>

1822
00:43:13.461 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 3>arresting you.</v>

1823
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.110
<v Speaker 3>There is look at the best of life.</v>

1824
00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1825
00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:18.410
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1826
00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:20.770
<v Speaker 3>The 49th parallel,</v>

1827
00:43:20.771 --> 00:43:21.310
<v Speaker 3>it says,</v>

1828
00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:22.070
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1829
00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:22.970
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1830
00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking crazy.</v>

1831
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.030
<v Speaker 3>I bet that's a,</v>

1832
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:28.970
<v Speaker 3>you need to passports to watch the there there America,</v>

1833
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:32.480
<v Speaker 3>there's where your terror should last the opposite of a wall.</v>

1834
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1835
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:34.960
<v Speaker 3>That's an actual welcoming pants actually.</v>

1836
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:35.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1837
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.250
<v Speaker 3>That shows how much we like Canada.</v>

1838
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1839
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.260
<v Speaker 3>Or how little you think about it.</v>

1840
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Make it easier to cross.</v>

1841
00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.210
<v Speaker 3>We'll make it really super easy.</v>

1842
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.820
<v Speaker 3>It's easier than the 100 yard stretch.</v>

1843
00:43:46.821 --> 00:43:47.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1844
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.690
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1845
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.790
<v Speaker 3>don't trip a really relax yourself.</v>

1846
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 3>You're about to hit paradise.</v>

1847
00:43:51.201 --> 00:43:51.740
<v Speaker 3>And most,</v>

1848
00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.990
<v Speaker 3>most of the visa overstays or Canadian,</v>

1849
00:43:55.070 --> 00:43:58.280
<v Speaker 3>which is the bulk of illegal immigration in America,</v>

1850
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.080
<v Speaker 3>is Canadians overstaying their visas.</v>

1851
00:44:00.081 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1852
00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.070
<v Speaker 3>I've done that.</v>

1853
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:01.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1854
00:44:01.281 --> 00:44:02.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a giant part of it,</v>

1855
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:02.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1856
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.901
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1857
00:44:02.901 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 3>we all overstay our welcome call British folks too.</v>

1858
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:05.780
<v Speaker 3>Definitely.</v>

1859
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1860
00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1861
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:08.210
<v Speaker 3>But no one cares.</v>

1862
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:10.670
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is they don't think about Canada.</v>

1863
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:14.420
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people in this country from a lot of other countries that just</v>

1864
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:15.680
<v Speaker 3>keep your fucking mouth shut.</v>

1865
00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:16.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1866
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.963
<v Speaker 3>No one knows.</v>

1867
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.631
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>

1868
00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:19.250
<v Speaker 3>whenever they say they know,</v>

1869
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:22.310
<v Speaker 3>like they take an estimate on how many illegal aliens might vats.</v>

1870
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:23.323
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

1871
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:23.691
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1872
00:44:23.691 --> 00:44:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1873
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:24.983
<v Speaker 3>Guest.</v>

1874
00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1875
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:27.080
<v Speaker 3>Well it's Kinda like,</v>

1876
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:27.770
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1877
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:28.690
<v Speaker 3>just thinking you actually had,</v>

1878
00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1879
00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:29.790
<v Speaker 3>was it,</v>

1880
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:30.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1881
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 3>Brian Cox on?</v>

1882
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1883
00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.600
<v Speaker 3>And he said when to talk about the,</v>

1884
00:44:33.601 --> 00:44:34.051
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>

1885
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:35.520
<v Speaker 3>the size of the universe.</v>

1886
00:44:35.521 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1887
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.930
<v Speaker 3>Most of it's just a guess based on the observable universe,</v>

1888
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:42.150
<v Speaker 3>based on the number of galaxies they can see.</v>

1889
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.460
<v Speaker 3>They're just guessing and how many galaxies there are.</v>

1890
00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.200
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the same as the illegal immigration.</v>

1891
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.140
<v Speaker 3>You're just going,</v>

1892
00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:47.973
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1893
00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:53.190
<v Speaker 3>if we can be more likely to be accurate with a illegal immigration than you are</v>

1894
00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:54.024
<v Speaker 3>with stars.</v>

1895
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:55.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1896
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1897
00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:56.880
<v Speaker 3>I think the star thing,</v>

1898
00:44:56.881 --> 00:44:57.870
<v Speaker 3>the problem is,</v>

1899
00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:58.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

1900
00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll butcher this,</v>

1901
00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:04.340
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's that literally we don't have the capability to look past 13</v>

1902
00:45:05.011 --> 00:45:06.630
<v Speaker 3>point whatever billion years.</v>

1903
00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:06.990
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1904
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.610
<v Speaker 3>The big band really look.</v>

1905
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1906
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:10.020
<v Speaker 3>So if they look and they go,</v>

1907
00:45:10.021 --> 00:45:10.251
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

1908
00:45:10.251 --> 00:45:10.301
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

1909
00:45:10.301 --> 00:45:14.760
<v Speaker 3>there's just like a big space and then you go 18 more billion years back,</v>

1910
00:45:14.761 --> 00:45:17.070
<v Speaker 3>there was a thriving community of galaxies,</v>

1911
00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:18.530
<v Speaker 3>galaxies,</v>

1912
00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:19.590
<v Speaker 3>that's distance and time.</v>

1913
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.370
<v Speaker 3>But then the,</v>

1914
00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 3>just the sheer vastness of the sky,</v>

1915
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:24.120
<v Speaker 3>they've only actually like,</v>

1916
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 3>like looked at a fraction of it.</v>

1917
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1918
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.930
<v Speaker 3>talking to a guy like him is so amazing because you realize like,</v>

1919
00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:31.171
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1920
00:45:31.171 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 3>well there's different kinds of humans.</v>

1921
00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:33.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1922
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:33.541
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1923
00:45:33.541 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 3>there's humans that are actually studying these insanely complicated equations</v>

1924
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:41.460
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to prove that the very nature of reality itself.</v>

1925
00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:45.000
<v Speaker 3>And then there's champs like me who are just listening going,</v>

1926
00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:45.391
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1927
00:45:45.391 --> 00:45:45.800
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

1928
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1929
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.621
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1930
00:45:46.621 --> 00:45:47.454
<v Speaker 3>So Real,</v>

1931
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.293
<v Speaker 3>real big.</v>

00:45:50.161 --> 00:45:50.994
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1934
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:53.220
<v Speaker 3>How do we know it started?</v>

1935
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.390
<v Speaker 3>There was a bang.</v>

1936
00:45:54.590 --> 00:45:55.410
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1937

1938
00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.030
<v Speaker 3>but I guess Brian Cox,</v>

1939
00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1940
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:05.390
<v Speaker 3>he's innovative and that he is an astrophysicist and he looks like a young David</v>

1941
00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Cassidy and he's a musician.</v>

1953
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.350

<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>

1957

2032
00:47:46.751 --> 00:47:47.710
<v Speaker 3>so effective.</v>

2033
00:47:47.711 --> 00:47:52.711
<v Speaker 3>It's so important because most of that stuff is so dry and so difficult to wrap</v>

2034
00:47:52.871 --> 00:47:53.651
<v Speaker 3>your head around.</v>

2045
00:48:08.231 --> 00:48:11.980
<v Speaker 3>He loves talking about it so much that it becomes infectious cause there's a lot</v>

2046
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 3>of that stuff that's very difficult to follow when you try to read the papers.</v>

2047
00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:21.550
<v Speaker 3>I read for Stephen Hawking books and I would zone out so much while I was trying</v>

2048
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:23.200
<v Speaker 3>to comprehend what was going on.</v>

2049
00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.090
<v Speaker 3>I had Lawrence Krauss on and a,</v>

2050
00:48:25.091 --> 00:48:27.760
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to get him to explain,</v>

2051
00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:28.903
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2052
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 3>some certain formulas and just,</v>

2053
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 3>even when he's explaining them to you,</v>

2054
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:37.870
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't seem to click like you,</v>

2055
00:48:37.871 --> 00:48:38.830
<v Speaker 3>you really have to,</v>

2056
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.770
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those things you,</v>

2057
00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.230
<v Speaker 3>it's like someone trying to explain French words to you by only speaking to you</v>

2058
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:45.064
<v Speaker 3>in French.</v>

2059
00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:46.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2060
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2061
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.800
<v Speaker 3>but I don't speak French.</v>

2062
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:48.101
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

2063
00:48:48.101 --> 00:48:48.281
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2064
00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:49.290
<v Speaker 3>well you're fucked.</v>

2065
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:55.070
<v Speaker 3>Like soon as you say infinity that that's only a mathematical idea.</v>

2066
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:56.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2067
00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I mean how can anything be infinite?</v>

2068
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:00.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2069
00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.113
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2070
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.320
<v Speaker 3>well there's minute math you can say it.</v>

2071
00:49:03.321 --> 00:49:06.940
<v Speaker 3>Like you can say that a straight line goes on forever and two parallel lines</v>

2072
00:49:06.941 --> 00:49:07.870
<v Speaker 3>will never intersect.</v>

2073
00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:09.370
<v Speaker 3>Pi As there theoretically,</v>

2074
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:14.890
<v Speaker 3>you know it never ends well why is that difficult to grasp though?</v>

2075
00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:16.000
<v Speaker 3>That's the real question.</v>

2076
00:49:16.001 --> 00:49:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Like why is,</v>

2077
00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:22.050
<v Speaker 3>why do we need everything to be defined by a very obvious beginning and an end?</v>

2078
00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's in everything we experienced has the beginning of that biologically</v>

2079
00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:28.090
<v Speaker 3>as we expand as time,</v>

2080
00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:29.650
<v Speaker 3>even in that time doesn't,</v>

2081
00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:32.230
<v Speaker 3>is not experienced everywhere the same way.</v>

2082
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:32.471
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2083
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:33.910
<v Speaker 3>time is experienced at all.</v>

2084
00:49:33.911 --> 00:49:38.580
<v Speaker 3>If you're not sentient true or what is tire Zona there,</v>

2085
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:39.250
<v Speaker 3>whack it off.</v>

2086
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.000
<v Speaker 3>It's different.</v>

2087
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.420
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

2088
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.300
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

2089
00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I always wondered if like there was a reason why we wanted things to have a</v>

2090
00:49:45.761 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 3>beginning and an end.</v>

2091
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.890
<v Speaker 3>Like is it because we have our life and our life has a beginning and an end all</v>

2092
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:55.891
<v Speaker 3>the lives of the people we know or we definitely are obsessed with a beginning</v>

2093
00:49:57.011 --> 00:49:59.870
<v Speaker 3>or an end or are we terrified of beginnings and ends thought too.</v>

2094
00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 3>That's why we create,</v>

2095
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:03.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2096
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:07.840
<v Speaker 3>God's and religions is because the idea that that life ends and that it's all</v>

2097
00:50:07.841 --> 00:50:08.674
<v Speaker 3>been for nothing,</v>

2098
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.060
<v Speaker 3>she's terrifying to people.</v>

2099
00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.110
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of that.</v>

2100
00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.513
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2101
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:16.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a little bit of like doing it to create order in the community and</v>

2102
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:19.240
<v Speaker 3>there's a little bit of people find mushrooms and they need an explanation.</v>

2103
00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:20.910
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck their feelings.</v>

2104
00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2105
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:26.190
<v Speaker 3>brains are constructed in such a way that we need an end or else you don't</v>

2106
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:27.351
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

2107
00:50:27.351 --> 00:50:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Where am I now?</v>

2108
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:28.370
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2109
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:29.203
<v Speaker 3>there's no end,</v>

2110
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 3>a very uninformed theory,</v>

2111
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:32.383
<v Speaker 3>which is that</v>

2112
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:38.540
<v Speaker 3>first off that everything is meaningless but that only the brain damaged or</v>

2113
00:50:38.541 --> 00:50:43.541
<v Speaker 3>capable of conceiving of meaninglessness because our brains are meaning machines</v>

2114
00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:49.040
<v Speaker 3>and that we evolved and it gave us an evolutionary advantage that we give</v>

2115
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:49.700
<v Speaker 3>meaning to things.</v>

2116
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

2117
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.040
<v Speaker 3>this is a table because we say it's a table.</v>

2118
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.750
<v Speaker 3>It's not a table to a cat.</v>

2119
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:59.150
<v Speaker 3>That's why cat will just get up and walk around on it from a mutual agreement.</v>

2120
00:50:59.151 --> 00:50:59.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2121
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.691
<v Speaker 3>we agree.</v>

2122
00:50:59.691 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 3>This is a table.</v>

2123
00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:03.620
<v Speaker 3>And that kind of meaning let us organize our lives,</v>

2124
00:51:03.621 --> 00:51:05.510
<v Speaker 3>let us be better hunters.</v>

2125
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.531
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2126
00:51:06.531 --> 00:51:06.971
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

2127
00:51:06.971 --> 00:51:08.570
<v Speaker 3>You know it constantly,</v>

2128
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:09.830
<v Speaker 3>it occurs to me and bothers me,</v>

2129
00:51:09.831 --> 00:51:13.700
<v Speaker 3>is that we decided not to drive into each other because we've painted a little</v>

2130
00:51:13.701 --> 00:51:15.440
<v Speaker 3>line on a road now in the middle.</v>

2131
00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:15.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2132
00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.500
<v Speaker 3>We've all agreed not to cross that line.</v>

2133
00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.001
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2134
00:51:19.001 --> 00:51:22.970
<v Speaker 3>We ascribe meaning to objects and that gave us an advantage over other animals.</v>

2135
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:25.640
<v Speaker 3>And so our brains just evolved.</v>

2136
00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 3>And then when we got to the point where we realize we're going to die,</v>

2137
00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:28.731
<v Speaker 3>we go,</v>

2138
00:51:28.731 --> 00:51:28.911
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2139
00:51:28.911 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 3>there's gotta be some meaning there too.</v>

2140
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:35.330
<v Speaker 3>So then we had to create myths that where do we go created meeting about our</v>

2141
00:51:35.331 --> 00:51:36.140
<v Speaker 3>lives?</v>

2142
00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 3>That's a very dangerous loop of there's no meaning to everything and nothing has</v>

2143
00:51:40.491 --> 00:51:41.810
<v Speaker 3>no mean nothing has meaning.</v>

2144
00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:46.160
<v Speaker 3>That's a dangerous loop for a person psychologically because you can get stuck</v>

2145
00:51:46.161 --> 00:51:48.080
<v Speaker 3>in that and you can really,</v>

2146
00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:51.650
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think you can because it's impossible to conceive of unless you are</v>

2147
00:51:51.651 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 3>seriously brain damaged.</v>

2148
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.331
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2149
00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:53.601
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2150
00:51:53.601 --> 00:51:55.520
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's impossible to conceive.</v>

2151
00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:55.780
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

2152
00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:56.150
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2153
00:51:56.150 --> 00:51:56.690
<v Speaker 3>you won't,</v>

2154
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:57.231
<v Speaker 3>you can imagine,</v>

2155
00:51:57.231 --> 00:51:58.580
<v Speaker 3>you can intellectually think about it,</v>

2156
00:51:58.581 --> 00:51:59.240
<v Speaker 3>but you can't,</v>

2157
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.410
<v Speaker 3>you can't grasp it.</v>

2158
00:52:00.411 --> 00:52:03.740
<v Speaker 3>Really living in the now kind of the same as life has no meaning,</v>

2159
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:06.140
<v Speaker 3>no office sing about the future.</v>

2160
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:07.293
<v Speaker 3>Thinking about,</v>

2161
00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.590
<v Speaker 3>you're not thinking about the fact that it has no meaning.</v>

2162
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:13.250
<v Speaker 3>You're enjoying life,</v>

2163
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.840
<v Speaker 3>you're enjoying experience,</v>

2164
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:18.410
<v Speaker 3>you're enjoying each interaction with people and you're enjoying your thoughts.</v>

2165
00:52:18.830 --> 00:52:19.261
<v Speaker 3>I think the,</v>

2166
00:52:19.261 --> 00:52:19.421
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2167
00:52:19.421 --> 00:52:20.930
<v Speaker 3>the problem that people have is like,</v>

2168
00:52:20.931 --> 00:52:21.680
<v Speaker 3>what's the point?</v>

2169
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:22.461
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

2170
00:52:22.461 --> 00:52:22.671
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>

2171
00:52:22.671 --> 00:52:23.091
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

2172
00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:23.871
<v Speaker 3>What's the point?</v>

2173
00:52:23.871 --> 00:52:24.460
<v Speaker 3>Thought?</v>

2174
00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's a weird loop.</v>

2175
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.120
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing is it doesn't really matter because you're going to create</v>

2176
00:52:29.121 --> 00:52:29.954
<v Speaker 3>a point anyway.</v>

2177
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.771
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2178
00:52:30.771 --> 00:52:31.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like there's,</v>

2179
00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.200
<v Speaker 3>I was an existential psychology they had,</v>

2180
00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:37.550
<v Speaker 3>there's like five different ways people ascribe meaning metaphysical meaning</v>

2181
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.510
<v Speaker 3>reproductive meaning,</v>

2182
00:52:38.511 --> 00:52:40.680
<v Speaker 3>biological meaning uh,</v>

2183
00:52:40.681 --> 00:52:43.270
<v Speaker 3>or creative meaning like the works you do right,</v>

2184
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.180
<v Speaker 3>that somehow you live on and all these different ways you're like a lot of</v>

2185
00:52:47.181 --> 00:52:51.290
<v Speaker 3>atheists are tend to be artists who believe that they live on through their work</v>

2186
00:52:51.620 --> 00:52:53.930
<v Speaker 3>and which is totally a stupid is believing in God.</v>

2187
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:54.561
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2188
00:52:54.561 --> 00:52:55.670
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely silly.</v>

2189
00:52:55.671 --> 00:52:59.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean obviously someone's going to enjoy your work but I think the real meaning</v>

2190
00:52:59.091 --> 00:53:02.240
<v Speaker 3>is in creating the work and then the fact that people are going to enjoy it if</v>

2191
00:53:02.241 --> 00:53:04.430
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it because you want it to live on forever,</v>

2192
00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:06.560
<v Speaker 3>you're a moron and good luck with that because there's no,</v>

2193
00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:08.390
<v Speaker 3>there's no forever the whole planet,</v>

2194
00:53:08.420 --> 00:53:11.390
<v Speaker 3>but I just think meaning is an inescapable product of the human mind.</v>

2195
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 3>The example,</v>

2196
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.513
<v Speaker 3>one example is like,</v>

2197
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.520
<v Speaker 3>like they did a study where they went all like into the jungles of the Amazon to</v>

2198
00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.680
<v Speaker 3>people who have never had any contact with the modern world and they drew a</v>

2199
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:25.470
<v Speaker 3>circle with two dots and a curved line and everyone sees a face.</v>

2200
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

2201
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.210
<v Speaker 4>Everyone sees a face.</v>

2202
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:30.450
<v Speaker 4>The only people who don't see a face or people who have been brain damaged and</v>

2203
00:53:30.451 --> 00:53:33.420
<v Speaker 4>can no longer form the meaning of those lines.</v>

2204
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:33.841
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2205
00:53:33.841 --> 00:53:34.530
<v Speaker 4>interesting.</v>

2206
00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:35.310
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>

2207
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:39.510
<v Speaker 4>there are people who suffer brain does not correspond to their own artwork</v>

2208
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:40.700
<v Speaker 4>because like the,</v>

2209
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:45.150
<v Speaker 4>our work is very similar to our artwork and the fact that stick figures and they</v>

2210
00:53:45.151 --> 00:53:47.550
<v Speaker 4>represent humans and the circle or does that's ahead.</v>

2211
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:47.851
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2212
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:48.600
<v Speaker 4>All that stuff.</v>

2213
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.330
<v Speaker 4>But they probably haven't had the happy face tee shirt.</v>

2214
00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.140
<v Speaker 4>I had lunch with Erich von Daniken last week.</v>

2215
00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:55.800
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2216
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.610
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2217
00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:57.690
<v Speaker 4>Very interesting.</v>

2218
00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.560
<v Speaker 4>Very weird.</v>

2219
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.990
<v Speaker 4>He's the guy who wrote chariots of the gods.</v>

2220
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:05.010
<v Speaker 4>He's in his eighties now fuck their house.</v>

2221
00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:05.610
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2222
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:06.990
<v Speaker 4>he was showing us slides.</v>

2223
00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:08.460
<v Speaker 4>What's the real story there?</v>

2224
00:54:08.461 --> 00:54:11.070
<v Speaker 4>I was wondering mostly nonsense,</v>

2225
00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:12.623
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately.</v>

2226
00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.320
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2227
00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:13.651
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2228
00:54:13.651 --> 00:54:14.400
<v Speaker 4>Mostly.</v>

2229
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.210
<v Speaker 4>Mostly what it is as evidence of law,</v>

2230
00:54:17.211 --> 00:54:18.090
<v Speaker 4>civilizations,</v>

2231
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 4>ancient civilizations that were incredibly advanced.</v>

2232
00:54:21.120 --> 00:54:25.680
<v Speaker 4>I follow the work of Graham Hancock and Randall Carlson and a few other people</v>

2233
00:54:25.681 --> 00:54:29.490
<v Speaker 4>that are being proven actually correct more and more,</v>

2234
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:32.400
<v Speaker 4>almost on a daily basis by new discoveries.</v>

2235
00:54:32.401 --> 00:54:33.700
<v Speaker 4>It show that the,</v>

2236
00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:37.710
<v Speaker 4>that civilization predates what we initially thought,</v>

2237
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:43.410
<v Speaker 4>that the initial thought was that somewhere around the great pyramids,</v>

2238
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 4>which is like 2,500 BC,</v>

2239
00:54:46.141 --> 00:54:47.730
<v Speaker 4>that was about as good as anybody got.</v>

2240
00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:49.800
<v Speaker 4>And you go back to like ancient Sumeria,</v>

2241
00:54:49.950 --> 00:54:51.720
<v Speaker 4>which is about 6,000 years ago.</v>

2242
00:54:51.721 --> 00:54:53.000
<v Speaker 4>And then that's basically it.</v>

2243
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:55.560
<v Speaker 4>What they're saying is that no,</v>

2244
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.810
<v Speaker 4>there was most likely a reset,</v>

2245
00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 4>a global reset of civilization due to a cataclysmic disaster.</v>

2246
00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:03.750
<v Speaker 4>And there's a shit ton of evidence.</v>

2247
00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:08.130
<v Speaker 4>There's massive evidence in the form of this nuclear glass that exist when</v>

2248
00:55:08.131 --> 00:55:09.660
<v Speaker 4>there's asteroidal impacts.</v>

2249
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:10.590
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2250
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:10.890
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2251
00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:14.490
<v Speaker 4>also there's a guy named doctor Robert Schoch is of the first guys to propose.</v>

2252
00:55:14.491 --> 00:55:16.740
<v Speaker 4>This is actually when he freaked me on the podcast.</v>

2253
00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:21.660
<v Speaker 4>He said there was a mass coronal ejection that most likely caused lightening</v>

2254
00:55:21.661 --> 00:55:24.000
<v Speaker 4>storms like a rainstorm,</v>

2255
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:28.410
<v Speaker 4>but lightning like that much lightning destroying the Glam and that the only</v>

2256
00:55:28.411 --> 00:55:31.560
<v Speaker 4>people that survived were people that could get under cover that could get into.</v>

2257
00:55:33.050 --> 00:55:38.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah and the mass extinction of 60 plus percent of the large mammals in a very</v>

2258
00:55:39.001 --> 00:55:42.060
<v Speaker 4>short window of time almost instantaneously in North America.</v>

2259
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.580
<v Speaker 4>The the end of the Ice Age,</v>

2260
00:55:44.760 --> 00:55:49.760
<v Speaker 4>like 10,000 plus years ago there was a mile high ice in most of North America,</v>

2261
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2262
00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:54.600
<v Speaker 4>Most of North American covered in ice and then gone and all these,</v>

2263
00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.280
<v Speaker 4>all these areas,</v>

2264
00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:58.800
<v Speaker 4>all these points of interest point to this one,</v>

2265
00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.570
<v Speaker 4>one moment in time.</v>

2266
00:56:00.571 --> 00:56:05.460
<v Speaker 4>That's somewhere between 10 and 12,000 years ago that some big event happened</v>

2267
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:10.170
<v Speaker 4>and that most likely just crippled civilization and then people had to rebuild</v>

2268
00:56:10.171 --> 00:56:15.060
<v Speaker 4>whatever people were around on that because it's also that they found like just</v>

2269
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:20.130
<v Speaker 4>looking at DNA that all of humanity at one point got wiped out except for like</v>

2270
00:56:20.131 --> 00:56:23.130
<v Speaker 4>one village that there was only that everyone is,</v>

2271
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.010
<v Speaker 4>everyone has</v>

2272
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:27.770
<v Speaker 3>descended from the same group of about 5,000 people.</v>

2273
00:56:27.771 --> 00:56:28.090
<v Speaker 3>That's well,</v>

2274
00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:32.890
<v Speaker 3>there was a super volcano that erupted somewhere around 70,000 years ago.</v>

2275
00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:37.830
<v Speaker 3>They think this is predating this cataclysmic disaster of 12,000 years ago that</v>

2276
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:41.410
<v Speaker 3>they are pretty sure wiped human beings down to a few thousand folks.</v>

2277
00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:42.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2278
00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.513
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's,</v>

2279
00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:46.210
<v Speaker 3>where's that?</v>

2280
00:56:46.210 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 3>That super volcano,</v>

2281
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.860
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2282
00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:50.260
<v Speaker 3>there's a supervolcano that knocked everybody down.</v>

2283
00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:51.890
<v Speaker 3>We'll find it.</v>

2284
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:52.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2285
00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:53.770
<v Speaker 3>We've got one under Yosemite,</v>

2286
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:54.633
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2287
00:56:56.250 --> 00:57:00.130
<v Speaker 3>Call Dara is going to get us all every six to 800,000 years.</v>

2288
00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:00.920
<v Speaker 3>It blows.</v>

2289
00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:01.300
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2290
00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:02.500
<v Speaker 3>That's why I don't go camping.</v>

2291
00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.740
<v Speaker 3>That's might not be the worst place to go.</v>

2292
00:57:05.900 --> 00:57:07.060
<v Speaker 3>Like go camping.</v>

2293
00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:08.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2294
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:09.370
<v Speaker 3>That way when it ends,</v>

2295
00:57:09.371 --> 00:57:09.971
<v Speaker 3>it ends quick.</v>

2296
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:11.380
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be living in New York,</v>

2297
00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:12.800
<v Speaker 3>which was choking on it.</v>

2298
00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:16.151
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst.</v>

2299
00:57:16.151 --> 00:57:18.250
<v Speaker 3>Watching people eat homeless folks in the street.</v>

2300
00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:18.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2301
00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:19.391
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

2302
00:57:19.391 --> 00:57:19.680
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2303
00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:21.010
<v Speaker 3>there's now in a place.</v>

2304
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:21.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2305
00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:22.270
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2306
00:57:22.270 --> 00:57:22.791
<v Speaker 3>it's awesome.</v>

2307
00:57:22.791 --> 00:57:23.200
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2308
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.230
<v Speaker 3>things that fly through space and zip by,</v>

2309
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:26.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2310
00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.600
<v Speaker 3>like they're,</v>

2311
00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.830
<v Speaker 3>they're just constantly finding these things.</v>

2312
00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:31.173
<v Speaker 3>That's the lights things,</v>

2313
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.350
<v Speaker 3>the Erich von Daniken thing.</v>

2314
00:57:32.351 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 3>I remember as a kid going,</v>

2315
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:38.230
<v Speaker 3>my problem was that they kept showing these massive paintings that can only be</v>

2316
00:57:38.231 --> 00:57:39.190
<v Speaker 3>seen from the sky.</v>

2317
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.850
<v Speaker 3>So therefore there must have been John for your aliens and I can,</v>

2318
00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:42.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2319
00:57:42.971 --> 00:57:45.040
<v Speaker 3>if you believe God is looking down on you,</v>

2320
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:47.410
<v Speaker 3>you're going to draw a big paintings for God to look at.</v>

2321
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:48.910
<v Speaker 3>So you don't need that.</v>

2322
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:49.261
<v Speaker 3>But now,</v>

2323
00:57:49.261 --> 00:57:49.870
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

2324
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:50.920
<v Speaker 3>But now I'm more,</v>

2325
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:51.641
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2326
00:57:51.641 --> 00:57:52.474
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2327
00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:57.650
<v Speaker 3>thing I've become obsessed with lately is there's a skepticism about Ufos.</v>

2328
00:57:59.200 --> 00:57:59.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2329
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:02.110
<v Speaker 3>That's why I want to talk to you about this because you told me that you've</v>

2330
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.110
<v Speaker 3>become obsessed with Ufos recently.</v>

2331
00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2332
00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:05.291
<v Speaker 3>Completely.</v>

2333
00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:06.124
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>

2334
00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:07.090
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2335
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:07.660
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

2336
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:08.110
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2337
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:08.321
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2338
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:10.870
<v Speaker 3>totally believe the UFO phenomenon is real.</v>

2339
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:11.741
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what it is,</v>

2340
00:58:11.741 --> 00:58:12.460
<v Speaker 3>but it's totally,</v>

2341
00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:13.450
<v Speaker 3>it has to be real.</v>

2342
00:58:13.451 --> 00:58:14.160
<v Speaker 3>Some things happened.</v>

2343
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

2344
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:17.140
<v Speaker 3>Because there's just way too much evidence that it is real.</v>

2345
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:17.830
<v Speaker 3>What evidence?</v>

2346
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:18.641
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2347
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:19.001
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2348
00:58:19.001 --> 00:58:19.834
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2349
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:20.950
<v Speaker 3>radar evidence,</v>

2350
00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:21.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2351
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.840
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

2352
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.370
<v Speaker 3>the [inaudible] locked on a Ufo,</v>

2353
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 3>that footage and also just,</v>

2354
00:58:26.471 --> 00:58:27.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2355
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.750
<v Speaker 3>like I know that friend of ours,</v>

2356
00:58:28.751 --> 00:58:30.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if she wants to say it,</v>

2357
00:58:30.131 --> 00:58:34.270
<v Speaker 3>but her father was an air traffic controller and he told her,</v>

2358
00:58:34.271 --> 00:58:34.630
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

2359
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2360
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.670
<v Speaker 3>every air traffic controller has seen something.</v>

2361
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:37.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2362
00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:41.140
<v Speaker 3>And I had another friend whose father was in a commercial pilot and she said,</v>

2363
00:58:41.141 --> 00:58:41.440
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2364
00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:45.280
<v Speaker 3>my dad said every single pilot has seen something and they've all been told not</v>

2365
00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:46.114
<v Speaker 3>to say anything about it.</v>

2366
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:49.410
<v Speaker 3>We have a couple of friends that say they were abducted.</v>

2367
00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2368
00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:50.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2369
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:54.820
<v Speaker 3>The abducted one is a little easier to wrap your head around because when you're</v>

2370
00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:55.420
<v Speaker 3>sleeping,</v>

2371
00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.660
<v Speaker 3>your brain is producing all sorts of indogenous psychedelic chemicals.</v>

2372
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2373
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:01.990
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of these experiences happen when you're sleeping.</v>

2374
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 3>Almost all of these experience,</v>

2375
00:59:03.341 --> 00:59:04.240
<v Speaker 3>when these people were abducted,</v>

2376
00:59:04.241 --> 00:59:05.320
<v Speaker 3>they're taken from their beds,</v>

2377
00:59:05.321 --> 00:59:06.340
<v Speaker 3>which is when they're dreaming.</v>

2378
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:06.971
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2379
00:59:06.971 --> 00:59:08.800
<v Speaker 3>it's just like there's some real clear,</v>

2380
00:59:08.801 --> 00:59:10.580
<v Speaker 3>easy steps to follow up on a fall,</v>

2381
00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Occam's razor and not,</v>

2382
00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.790
<v Speaker 3>you're not get crazy,</v>

2383
00:59:12.791 --> 00:59:13.601
<v Speaker 3>but it knocks those out,</v>

2384
00:59:13.601 --> 00:59:16.180
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't knock out like Barney and Betty Hill and all the people that are</v>

2385
00:59:16.181 --> 00:59:19.210
<v Speaker 3>abducted will fully conscious and that and that remember it without</v>

2386
00:59:19.211 --> 00:59:20.044
<v Speaker 3>hypnotherapy.</v>

2387
00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:21.440
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2388
00:59:21.441 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure about</v>

2389
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:23.150
<v Speaker 4>the abduction phenomenon,</v>

2390
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:25.250
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know Barney and Betty Hill.</v>

2391
00:59:25.251 --> 00:59:26.084
<v Speaker 4>I know the story,</v>

2392
00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:27.080
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know them,</v>

2393
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:31.760
<v Speaker 4>so I would have to know them because there's a lot of people that I've taught,</v>

2394
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:33.220
<v Speaker 4>like I did a show for Scifi,</v>

2395
00:59:33.221 --> 00:59:34.400
<v Speaker 4>I called Joe Rogan questions.</v>

2396
00:59:34.401 --> 00:59:36.920
<v Speaker 4>Everything that cured me.</v>

2397
00:59:37.330 --> 00:59:39.980
<v Speaker 4>It show cured me of a lot of my nonsense with,</v>

2398
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.520
<v Speaker 4>with conspiracies when we used to talk about,</v>

2399
00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:43.040
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

2400
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:43.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2401
00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:44.660
<v Speaker 4>that's definitely him all the time.</v>

2402
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2403
00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:45.261
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2404
00:59:45.261 --> 00:59:45.750
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

2405
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:47.540
<v Speaker 4>I needed to actually study it.</v>

2406
00:59:47.541 --> 00:59:48.770
<v Speaker 4>So for six months,</v>

2407
00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:50.360
<v Speaker 4>that's basically all I did.</v>

2408
00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I interviewed people and I like big foot believers,</v>

2409
00:59:54.831 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 4>Ufo believers.</v>

2410
00:59:56.810 --> 01:00:01.810
<v Speaker 4>And the one thing that they have in common is they all seem to be kind of lost</v>

2411
01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 4>and dependent upon this thing being real.</v>

2412
01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2413
01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Instead of being objective.</v>

2414
01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:11.960
<v Speaker 4>There's only one lady that I interviewed that saw big that really seemed to be</v>

2415
01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:12.794
<v Speaker 4>telling the truth,</v>

2416
01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:16.490
<v Speaker 4>but I think she saw bear bear's walk on two feet all the time.</v>

2417
01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.510
<v Speaker 4>They do it all the time.</v>

2418
01:00:17.511 --> 01:00:18.261
<v Speaker 4>It's video footage,</v>

2419
01:00:18.261 --> 01:00:19.430
<v Speaker 4>you to find it all the time.</v>

2420
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:21.380
<v Speaker 4>And she was in the Pacific northwest,</v>

2421
01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:23.000
<v Speaker 4>which is incredibly dense woods.</v>

2422
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.290
<v Speaker 4>You see something,</v>

2423
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:25.124
<v Speaker 4>you glimpse it.</v>

2424
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.630
<v Speaker 4>Look I was hunting once in,</v>

2425
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:27.021
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

2426
01:00:27.021 --> 01:00:30.350
<v Speaker 4>in Canada and Alberta and I thought I saw a wolf for like two seconds.</v>

2427
01:00:30.351 --> 01:00:31.184
<v Speaker 4>It was a squirrel.</v>

2428
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:32.110
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2429
01:00:32.110 --> 01:00:32.900
<v Speaker 4>Understand this.</v>

2430
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.880
<v Speaker 4>This is fucking not squirrel.</v>

2431
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2432
01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:37.480
<v Speaker 4>no I just saw far right.</v>

2433
01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:42.540
<v Speaker 4>I saw for cause it's really dense was cause I was looking for fucking wolves</v>

2434
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:43.910
<v Speaker 4>cause I was like,</v>

2435
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.830
<v Speaker 4>cause I know we did see one wolf.</v>

2436
01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:47.600
<v Speaker 4>It cross the roads.</v>

2437
01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:50.360
<v Speaker 4>Either wolf or coyote was hard to tell cause it was at dusk.</v>

2438
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:51.320
<v Speaker 4>It was very dark out.</v>

2439
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.453
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2440
01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:54.200
<v Speaker 4>when you're looking for something,</v>

2441
01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:56.150
<v Speaker 4>you think everything is that thing you're looking for.</v>

2442
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:56.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2443
01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:57.100
<v Speaker 4>So for like a,</v>

2444
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:57.950
<v Speaker 4>for a second,</v>

2445
01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.410
<v Speaker 4>huge thought that fucking squirrel was a wolf.</v>

2446
01:01:00.411 --> 01:01:00.891
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

2447
01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:01.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2448
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Well the expectation and perception are very linked.</v>

2449
01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2450
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:04.700
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2451
01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:09.700
<v Speaker 4>Well this us that they found that that 50% of everything you see is a product of</v>

2452
01:01:10.251 --> 01:01:10.800
<v Speaker 4>memory.</v>

2453
01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2454
01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:11.880
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

2455
01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.370
<v Speaker 4>that when you observe something,</v>

2456
01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.900
<v Speaker 4>they've done frm Mris and that most of the activity in the brain is in the</v>

2457
01:01:17.901 --> 01:01:18.530
<v Speaker 4>memory centers,</v>

2458
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:19.071
<v Speaker 4>not in the,</v>

2459
01:01:19.071 --> 01:01:19.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2460
01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.300
<v Speaker 4>visual sneakers.</v>

2461
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:20.931
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

2462
01:01:20.931 --> 01:01:22.450
<v Speaker 4>Only about 50% of the activities,</v>

2463
01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.400
<v Speaker 4>individual centers of the brain.</v>

2464
01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:24.710
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2465
01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:25.191
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2466
01:01:25.191 --> 01:01:25.280
<v Speaker 4>the</v>

2467
01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.113
<v Speaker 2>thing is very,</v>

2468
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:26.490
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2469
01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:27.900
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

2470
01:01:27.930 --> 01:01:32.550
<v Speaker 2>I went and saw Carl Sagan speak at u of t at the University of Toronto and I was</v>

2471
01:01:32.551 --> 01:01:32.761
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2472
01:01:32.761 --> 01:01:33.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2473
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:38.510
<v Speaker 2>14 but he did an equation on the board of the possibility of alien life other</v>

2474
01:01:41.071 --> 01:01:42.120
<v Speaker 2>than us in the universe.</v>

2475
01:01:42.690 --> 01:01:44.850
<v Speaker 2>And it came to the smallest.</v>

2476
01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:45.181
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2477
01:01:45.181 --> 01:01:47.310
<v Speaker 2>he spent the whole time writing on this chalkboard.</v>

2478
01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:48.960
<v Speaker 2>It was fascinating.</v>

2479
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>They actually came up with a number at the end and it was such a small,</v>

2480
01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.250
<v Speaker 2>he says there is,</v>

2481
01:01:56.490 --> 01:01:58.290
<v Speaker 2>there is something out there,</v>

2482
01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:03.860
<v Speaker 2>but they are so far away that they'll,</v>

2483
01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:06.660
<v Speaker 2>that unless they can go faster than the speed of light,</v>

2484
01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.750
<v Speaker 2>which he said was impossible at the time.</v>

2485
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:10.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2486
01:02:10.380 --> 01:02:11.213
<v Speaker 2>The Seventies.</v>

2487
01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2488
01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:12.693
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2489
01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:14.430
<v Speaker 2>there's no way we've seen them.</v>

2490
01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:15.301
<v Speaker 2>That's what he said.</v>

2491
01:02:15.301 --> 01:02:20.250
<v Speaker 2>So if some other beings have conquered speed of light thing,</v>

2492
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 3>then maybe we could see them.</v>

2493
01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:22.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2494
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:27.980
<v Speaker 3>But that's a thing with the exact problem with his skepticism in general is like</v>

2495
01:02:29.281 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

2496
01:02:29.730 --> 01:02:30.563
<v Speaker 3>that it,</v>

2497
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:31.141
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2498
01:02:31.141 --> 01:02:31.320
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2499
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:32.190
<v Speaker 3>like the skeptics,</v>

2500
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.150
<v Speaker 3>skeptics of the,</v>

2501
01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:34.470
<v Speaker 3>of the 19th century,</v>

2502
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 3>the ones who said germs don't exist.</v>

2503
01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:36.360
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2504
01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Cause we can't see them.</v>

2505
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:37.550
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2506
01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:41.190
<v Speaker 3>and people who said germs did exist were ridiculed and laughed out of the trade.</v>

2507
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2508
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:44.910
<v Speaker 3>And I agree with you completely.</v>

2509
01:02:44.911 --> 01:02:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Just because you can't see it or it isn't happening.</v>

2510
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.660
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean it can't happen.</v>

2511
01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.820
<v Speaker 3>And even since Sagans Day be,</v>

2512
01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.910
<v Speaker 3>there had been no exoplanets discovered then we now though,</v>

2513
01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.120
<v Speaker 3>there are literally trillions and trillions of sure planet earth,</v>

2514
01:02:57.121 --> 01:02:57.954
<v Speaker 3>like planets.</v>

2515
01:02:58.650 --> 01:02:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2516
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.480
<v Speaker 3>well they just speculate as to the existence of them outside of our sources and</v>

2517
01:03:02.481 --> 01:03:03.260
<v Speaker 3>before the,</v>

2518
01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:04.920
<v Speaker 3>the real problem is that if some,</v>

2519
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:07.140
<v Speaker 3>there's a leap and a leap,</v>

2520
01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:12.141
<v Speaker 3>a technological leap that opens the doors to massive innovation that once this</v>

2521
01:03:12.811 --> 01:03:13.740
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>

2522
01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.180
<v Speaker 3>once this happens in this,</v>

2523
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:20.360
<v Speaker 3>and then all this stuff sort of exponentially expands in terms of technological</v>

2524
01:03:20.851 --> 01:03:21.684
<v Speaker 3>possibilities,</v>

2525
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:26.840
<v Speaker 3>all you would need is a few hundred years and you have an unrecognizable set of</v>

2526
01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 3>technology.</v>

2527
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:30.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2528
01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:30.600
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2529
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.670
<v Speaker 3>You know what were talking about certain,</v>

2530
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:33.091
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2531
01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:33.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2532
01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:36.690
<v Speaker 3>anti matter idea that they're still trying to figure out,</v>

2533
01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:38.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2534
01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:43.060
<v Speaker 3>that's an insane sorts of energy you have never even experienced.</v>

2535
01:03:43.741 --> 01:03:44.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2536
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:45.323
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2537
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.010
<v Speaker 3>with the,</v>

2538
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:50.400
<v Speaker 3>with us grain of sand and you can run a city and it was that big.</v>

2539
01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:52.290
<v Speaker 3>And then there's also the theory,</v>

2540
01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:53.370
<v Speaker 3>there's recent one,</v>

2541
01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:55.350
<v Speaker 3>that space time itself doesn't exist.</v>

2542
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:56.781
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>

2543
01:03:56.781 --> 01:04:01.370
<v Speaker 3>the speed of light barrier becomes moot because that is,</v>

2544
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.690
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's the holographic quantum hologram there.</v>

2545
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:06.480
<v Speaker 3>Quantum holographic theory of the universe.</v>

2546
01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Sounds like Talbot's book.</v>

2547
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:09.421
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2548
01:04:09.421 --> 01:04:11.220
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember holographic universe,</v>

2549
01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

2550
01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:12.271
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2551
01:04:12.271 --> 01:04:12.990
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

2552
01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:16.170
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that the universe is basically just a geometry that,</v>

2553
01:04:16.590 --> 01:04:19.530
<v Speaker 3>that when you look at it from a certain angle seems three dimensional and it</v>

2554
01:04:19.531 --> 01:04:19.961
<v Speaker 3>folds on,</v>

2555
01:04:19.961 --> 01:04:21.180
<v Speaker 3>it folds into itself.</v>

2556
01:04:21.210 --> 01:04:22.043
<v Speaker 3>So you could,</v>

2557
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.510
<v Speaker 3>and it's traveled through the wormhole thing.</v>

2558
01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:25.501
<v Speaker 3>It's not even that,</v>

2559
01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:26.370
<v Speaker 3>it's the idea that,</v>

2560
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2561
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.460
<v Speaker 3>that space time is an illusion is,</v>

2562
01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:30.303
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2563
01:04:30.450 --> 01:04:31.070
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>

2564
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.070
<v Speaker 3>that it doesn't really exist.</v>

2565
01:04:32.071 --> 01:04:32.881
<v Speaker 3>And that's why,</v>

2566
01:04:32.881 --> 01:04:33.180
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2567
01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:33.421
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2568
01:04:33.421 --> 01:04:33.660
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2569
01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:34.493
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2570
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:35.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2571
01:04:35.010 --> 01:04:36.720
<v Speaker 3>entanglement is possible.</v>

2572
01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:37.501
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2573
01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:37.981
<v Speaker 3>the idea that,</v>

2574
01:04:37.981 --> 01:04:38.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2575
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:38.581
<v Speaker 3>spooky,</v>

2576
01:04:38.581 --> 01:04:39.900
<v Speaker 3>spooky action at a distance.</v>

2577
01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:40.470
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2578
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:42.870
<v Speaker 3>That a quantum entanglement.</v>

2579
01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:44.613
<v Speaker 3>The reason that,</v>

2580
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2581
01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:45.811
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2582
01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:46.644
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2583
01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:47.311
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

2584
01:04:47.311 --> 01:04:47.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2585
01:04:47.491 --> 01:04:51.630
<v Speaker 3>Adam's on opposite ends of the universe can be affect each other instantaneously</v>

2586
01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.810
<v Speaker 3>is cause they're not really at an opposite ends of the universe.</v>

2587
01:04:54.811 --> 01:04:55.860
<v Speaker 3>They're really right next to each other.</v>

2588
01:04:55.861 --> 01:04:57.930
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like they're at opposite ends of the universe.</v>

2589
01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Because our ability to perceive as basically based on what we have to do to stay</v>

2590
01:05:03.661 --> 01:05:05.040
<v Speaker 3>alive on this planet.</v>

2591
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:07.590
<v Speaker 3>So our meager little chimp brains,</v>

2592
01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:08.970
<v Speaker 3>you have trying to,</v>

2593
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:12.810
<v Speaker 3>trying to quantify all of these things that are around us all the time.</v>

2594
01:05:12.811 --> 01:05:16.920
<v Speaker 3>So we put them into this sort of three dimensional box of movement and,</v>

2595
01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.580
<v Speaker 3>and that the entire,</v>

2596
01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:23.440
<v Speaker 3>the entire universe could be a compact thing that projects itself like a</v>

2597
01:05:23.441 --> 01:05:25.480
<v Speaker 3>hologram onto a screen.</v>

2598
01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:28.260
<v Speaker 4>I love these kinds of conversations because I'm clearly too stupid to really</v>

2599
01:05:28.261 --> 01:05:29.580
<v Speaker 4>understand what I don't understand.</v>

2600
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:32.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't listen anything I just said and I don't understand you too.</v>

2601
01:05:32.691 --> 01:05:33.990
<v Speaker 4>So how stupid does that make me?</v>

2602
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:34.681
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2603
01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:35.700
<v Speaker 4>we don't understand each other.</v>

2604
01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.193
<v Speaker 4>We're all the same.</v>

2605
01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:38.363
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2606
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:42.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it'd be interesting to do it like a documentary or something about,</v>

2607
01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:43.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2608
01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:44.330
<v Speaker 3>about euphology.</v>

2609
01:05:44.330 --> 01:05:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Cause if one thing is the assumption that they're extra terrestrial is an</v>

2610
01:05:46.731 --> 01:05:47.564
<v Speaker 3>assumption.</v>

2611
01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:53.830
<v Speaker 3>But the thing that intrigues me is the power of ridicule to silence.</v>

2612
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Even the most intelligent people in our community from examining something like</v>

2613
01:05:57.981 --> 01:06:01.370
<v Speaker 3>the ridicule kept doctors from accepting germs.</v>

2614
01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.150
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2615
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:03.110
<v Speaker 3>Cause they didn't want to,</v>

2616
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.260
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want to be ridiculed by their peers.</v>

2617
01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.300
<v Speaker 3>And even now you've got people that will,</v>

2618
01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:13.330
<v Speaker 3>like Michael Shermer will cling to the most absurd explanations for phenomena</v>

2619
01:06:14.031 --> 01:06:16.550
<v Speaker 3>like the f 16 a radar footage.</v>

2620
01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:17.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2621
01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:18.230
<v Speaker 3>what did he,</v>

2622
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:19.510
<v Speaker 3>what was a Michael Shermer,</v>

2623
01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.480
<v Speaker 3>I can't even remember,</v>

2624
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:21.050
<v Speaker 3>but it was,</v>

2625
01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:22.100
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty,</v>

2626
01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:26.120
<v Speaker 3>it really went to great lengths that entailed having to basically,</v>

2627
01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2628
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:31.790
<v Speaker 3>diminish any respect you have for any of the people who reported on the events.</v>

2629
01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:36.590
<v Speaker 3>It had to go and had to go into character assassination in order to eliminate</v>

2630
01:06:36.591 --> 01:06:36.990
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2631
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.411
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2632
01:06:37.411 --> 01:06:38.970
<v Speaker 4>he loves the best way to kill an idea.</v>

2633
01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:42.210
<v Speaker 4>He's a professional skeptic and I like Michael a lot and he's been on the</v>

2634
01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:43.160
<v Speaker 4>podcast may times,</v>

2635
01:06:43.161 --> 01:06:43.440
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2636
01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.020
<v Speaker 4>I actually had him debate Randall Carlson and,</v>

2637
01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:46.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2638
01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:51.980
<v Speaker 4>Graham Hancock about these ancient civilizations and it wasn't very good for</v>

2639
01:06:52.021 --> 01:06:52.320
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2640
01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:52.970
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2641
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:54.720
<v Speaker 4>or some swanky moments.</v>

2642
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Cause skeptics are believers.</v>

2643
01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:57.880
<v Speaker 4>Well the problem is they're leaving.</v>

2644
01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:58.861
<v Speaker 4>Even Scott,</v>

2645
01:06:58.861 --> 01:07:01.020
<v Speaker 4>the problem is being a skeptic itself,</v>

2646
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.700
<v Speaker 4>it's a stupid way to look at the world.</v>

2647
01:07:03.270 --> 01:07:05.010
<v Speaker 4>You're actually sure about something.</v>

2648
01:07:05.011 --> 01:07:06.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean you shouldn't be objective.</v>

2649
01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:07.330
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2650
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:08.190
<v Speaker 4>Be Skeptical.</v>

2651
01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.510
<v Speaker 4>Being skeptical is like,</v>

2652
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:10.160
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2653
01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2654
01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:13.530
<v Speaker 4>But I know for sure that that's not true,</v>

2655
01:07:14.010 --> 01:07:18.900
<v Speaker 4>but it serves a massive purpose for people that really don't understand things</v>

2656
01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:19.900
<v Speaker 4>and he can explain it to you.</v>

2657
01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:21.300
<v Speaker 4>And with actual science,</v>

2658
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:24.690
<v Speaker 4>as long as the actual science is being used and it's not,</v>

2659
01:07:24.691 --> 01:07:26.910
<v Speaker 4>character assassination is not mockery.</v>

2660
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:27.743
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

2661
01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:28.530
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

2662
01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:31.560
<v Speaker 4>There's certain people that are just debunkers.</v>

2663
01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.330
<v Speaker 4>They can call themselves skeptics,</v>

2664
01:07:33.331 --> 01:07:34.890
<v Speaker 4>but they're not looking at things like,</v>

2665
01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:35.191
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2666
01:07:35.191 --> 01:07:36.330
<v Speaker 4>maybe that is effective.</v>

2667
01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that is healthy.</v>

2668
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:39.150
<v Speaker 4>That is interesting and no,</v>

2669
01:07:39.151 --> 01:07:40.200
<v Speaker 4>they don't look at it that way.</v>

2670
01:07:40.201 --> 01:07:41.010
<v Speaker 4>They're looking at it,</v>

2671
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:45.630
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to pick it apart and that's fine if you can pick it apart,</v>

2672
01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:46.710
<v Speaker 4>but if you cannot,</v>

2673
01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:49.170
<v Speaker 4>you have to be objective about the fact that,</v>

2674
01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:52.830
<v Speaker 4>oh well this is a very interesting phenomenon and this is what we know about</v>

2675
01:07:52.831 --> 01:07:53.581
<v Speaker 4>science is that,</v>

2676
01:07:53.581 --> 01:07:55.200
<v Speaker 4>and this is what we know about this thing.</v>

2677
01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:56.490
<v Speaker 4>And right now we have,</v>

2678
01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:57.870
<v Speaker 4>we have a weird conundrum.</v>

2679
01:07:57.980 --> 01:07:59.550
<v Speaker 4>Did chariots of the gods,</v>

2680
01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.590
<v Speaker 3>did he work on Danica was,</v>

2681
01:08:01.591 --> 01:08:04.400
<v Speaker 3>he was he hundred percent</v>

2682
01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:06.620
<v Speaker 4>he's all is still in all in.</v>

2683
01:08:06.770 --> 01:08:07.371
<v Speaker 4>I asked him,</v>

2684
01:08:07.371 --> 01:08:08.121
<v Speaker 4>the first thing I asked him,</v>

2685
01:08:08.121 --> 01:08:08.331
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2686
01:08:08.331 --> 01:08:11.260
<v Speaker 4>what is it the desperately have to go pee go.</v>

2687
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.600
<v Speaker 4>The first thing I asked him was what is the most piece of evidence?</v>

2688
01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:17.690
<v Speaker 4>Does the,</v>

2689
01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:18.051
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2690
01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:20.030
<v Speaker 4>and he pointed to this,</v>

2691
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:20.864
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2692
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:24.980
<v Speaker 4>a Mayan stone plaque that's in Pelinka.</v>

2693
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:26.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna have you ever seen it?</v>

2694
01:08:26.511 --> 01:08:27.344
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>

2695
01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:28.670
<v Speaker 4>it's this book.</v>

2696
01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:29.840
<v Speaker 4>It's a god,</v>

2697
01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:31.310
<v Speaker 4>a one of their,</v>

2698
01:08:31.311 --> 01:08:32.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2699
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:36.020
<v Speaker 4>one of their former kings that is lying on his back and he's,</v>

2700
01:08:36.021 --> 01:08:38.150
<v Speaker 4>it looks like he's moving some,</v>

2701
01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:38.781
<v Speaker 4>see Jamie,</v>

2702
01:08:38.781 --> 01:08:39.860
<v Speaker 4>see if we could find that thing.</v>

2703
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.420
<v Speaker 4>It's this really cool,</v>

2704
01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:42.440
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2705
01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:47.440
<v Speaker 4>carving that they found that looks like there's a guy who is in a seat and it</v>

2706
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:50.390
<v Speaker 4>looks like there's fire behind his back.</v>

2707
01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:51.730
<v Speaker 4>And you could say,</v>

2708
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:56.240
<v Speaker 4>you could say that he's manipulating controls on a ship and he's,</v>

2709
01:08:56.290 --> 01:08:56.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2710
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:58.250
<v Speaker 4>shooting a rocket into the heaven.</v>

2711
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.370
<v Speaker 4>I would like to see what the s,</v>

2712
01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:03.980
<v Speaker 4>the mainstream version of that is because it also,</v>

2713
01:09:03.981 --> 01:09:04.970
<v Speaker 4>it could just be art,</v>

2714
01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:06.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2715
01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:06.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm imagining being,</v>

2716
01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:07.610
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2717
01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:08.720
<v Speaker 4>it could be that they,</v>

2718
01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:12.380
<v Speaker 4>they knew about certain things being propelled by fire.</v>

2719
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:13.150
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>

2720
01:09:13.150 --> 01:09:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2721
01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:14.293
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2722
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:15.680
<v Speaker 4>So if you see this,</v>

2723
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.221
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2724
01:09:16.221 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 4>that's a big ass stretch to say,</v>

2725
01:09:17.841 --> 01:09:18.980
<v Speaker 4>that guy's in a spaceship.</v>

2726
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck that is.</v>

2727
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:22.710
<v Speaker 4>He's sitting down can alter kind of.</v>

2728
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:23.660
<v Speaker 4>He could.</v>

2729
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2730
01:09:24.111 --> 01:09:26.270
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't look like he's looking through an Ip.</v>

2731
01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2732
01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.553
<v Speaker 4>What's true,</v>

2733
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:28.881
<v Speaker 4>but what does that mean?</v>

2734
01:09:28.881 --> 01:09:29.750
<v Speaker 4>Is it a telescope?</v>

2735
01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:31.060
<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's just kind of telescope.</v>

2736
01:09:31.061 --> 01:09:32.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean they just an astronomer.</v>

2737
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2738
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.311
<v Speaker 4>it is possible.</v>

2739
01:09:34.311 --> 01:09:35.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they had telescopes.</v>

2740
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:39.080
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it telescope was even invented till no.</v>

2741
01:09:39.081 --> 01:09:40.520
<v Speaker 4>Do they even have glass at that point?</v>

2742
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:41.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

2743
01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:43.160
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't know if the Mayans did.</v>

2744
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:44.030
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2745
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.330
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2746
01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:47.900
<v Speaker 4>but that was his number one piece of evidence was wow.</v>

2747
01:09:47.980 --> 01:09:48.411
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2748
01:09:48.411 --> 01:09:49.790
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of silly.</v>

2749
01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean when we were kids in the 70s the,</v>

2750
01:09:52.270 --> 01:09:52.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2751
01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.393
<v Speaker 4>big foot,</v>

2752
01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2753
01:09:54.081 --> 01:09:57.170
<v Speaker 4>and cherry to the gods and everything was so new.</v>

2754
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 4>It look at this image,</v>

2755
01:09:58.580 --> 01:09:59.510
<v Speaker 4>look at the bottom of it.</v>

2756
01:09:59.511 --> 01:10:02.180
<v Speaker 4>Even the part where the flame supposed to be coming out from below him.</v>

2757
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:04.423
<v Speaker 4>Where's the flame?</v>

2758
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:06.140
<v Speaker 4>The flame is the shit.</v>

2759
01:10:06.141 --> 01:10:06.621
<v Speaker 4>The very,</v>

2760
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:07.520
<v Speaker 4>very bottom.</v>

2761
01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.121
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>

2762
01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:09.740
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even sure I buy that.</v>

2763
01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 4>If you were going to draw fire,</v>

2764
01:10:11.691 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 4>you do a really shitty job.</v>

2765
01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:13.860
<v Speaker 4>If that's your fire,</v>

2766
01:10:13.861 --> 01:10:15.350
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't really look like fire to me.</v>

2767
01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.910
<v Speaker 4>Like it could be anything.</v>

2768
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.883
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2769
01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:19.251
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2770
01:10:19.251 --> 01:10:19.381
<v Speaker 4>If,</v>

2771
01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:20.570
<v Speaker 4>if that's fire,</v>

2772
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.490
<v Speaker 4>like what is all the stuff around them?</v>

2773
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:23.420
<v Speaker 4>What's all that stuff?</v>

2774
01:10:23.421 --> 01:10:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Is that that looked kind of mechanical though,</v>

2775
01:10:25.041 --> 01:10:25.251
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2776
01:10:25.251 --> 01:10:26.750
<v Speaker 4>It looks like there's bolts does,</v>

2777
01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:27.830
<v Speaker 4>if they have a fire,</v>

2778
01:10:27.831 --> 01:10:29.210
<v Speaker 4>God maybe they drew the fire.</v>

2779
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:30.043
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

2780
01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:32.720
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a monkey kind of face with titties.</v>

2781
01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Monkey's got some titties.</v>

2782
01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:34.251
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2783
01:10:34.251 --> 01:10:34.940
<v Speaker 4>now I get it.</v>

2784
01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:35.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2785
01:10:35.420 --> 01:10:36.253
<v Speaker 4>And then the monkeys,</v>

2786
01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.310
<v Speaker 4>is that his teeth?</v>

2787
01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.620
<v Speaker 4>It's the first tutors arms actually.</v>

2788
01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:40.340
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2789
01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:40.760
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

2790
01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:41.593
<v Speaker 4>It could be armed.</v>

2791
01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:45.290
<v Speaker 4>But that's the point is it's so open to interpretation.</v>

2792
01:10:45.291 --> 01:10:48.500
<v Speaker 4>There's so much that you could see if you're looking to see,</v>

2793
01:10:48.501 --> 01:10:51.410
<v Speaker 4>but what I do see is this guy who's,</v>

2794
01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:55.880
<v Speaker 4>he's reclining and chilling and it looks like he's looking through something.</v>

2795
01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:58.040
<v Speaker 4>What's that thing hanging across him?</v>

2796
01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.690
<v Speaker 4>You see that thing across his arm.</v>

2797
01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:01.350
<v Speaker 4>You know what the fuck that is.</v>

2798
01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.170
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing.</v>

2799
01:11:03.171 --> 01:11:04.970
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody knows what the fuck that is.</v>

2800
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.601
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

2801
01:11:05.601 --> 01:11:10.601
<v Speaker 4>so for him to say that this was the number one most compelling evidence,</v>

2802
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.971
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2803
01:11:10.971 --> 01:11:12.320
<v Speaker 4>where people getting high at this point.</v>

2804
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:13.170
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2805
01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:17.160
<v Speaker 4>so I'm in that could be just some guy got high and LSD carve something.</v>

2806
01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:17.461
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2807
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:17.760
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

2808
01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:18.161
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

2809
01:11:18.161 --> 01:11:18.630
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2810
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:21.630
<v Speaker 4>taking different kinds of plants that have like search,</v>

2811
01:11:21.631 --> 01:11:22.464
<v Speaker 4>like acid in them.</v>

2812
01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:23.670
<v Speaker 4>There was a,</v>

2813
01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:25.320
<v Speaker 4>I had a great tour,</v>

2814
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2815
01:11:26.010 --> 01:11:28.140
<v Speaker 4>in teaching Eatsa we,</v>

2816
01:11:28.141 --> 01:11:28.471
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2817
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:33.180
<v Speaker 4>went through and we hired a guide who was a professor who was fantastic.</v>

2818
01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:34.200
<v Speaker 4>It was really good.</v>

2819
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.980
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

2820
01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:39.000
<v Speaker 4>he was really loved Mayan civilization is super passionate about it.</v>

2821
01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:41.640
<v Speaker 4>And then when he found out that I'd read a bunch of books on and he was really</v>

2822
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:42.331
<v Speaker 4>excited about it.</v>

2823
01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:43.260
<v Speaker 4>So he took us to these,</v>

2824
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:44.850
<v Speaker 4>all these different areas.</v>

2825
01:11:44.851 --> 01:11:47.280
<v Speaker 4>But there was one area where they had this like,</v>

2826
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.830
<v Speaker 4>like hall where they would just get fucked up.</v>

2827
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:50.641
<v Speaker 4>And he was like,</v>

2828
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:51.000
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2829
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.230
<v Speaker 4>this is where they would do their,</v>

2830
01:11:52.231 --> 01:11:53.280
<v Speaker 4>their psychedelics.</v>

2831
01:11:53.870 --> 01:11:56.190
<v Speaker 4>They would take different forms of plants.</v>

2832
01:11:56.370 --> 01:11:59.490
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of different plants like a morning glory seeds.</v>

2833
01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:00.001
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

2834
01:12:00.001 --> 01:12:00.211
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2835
01:12:00.211 --> 01:12:01.470
<v Speaker 4>Morning glory seeds.</v>

2836
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:02.670
<v Speaker 4>The same ones you find today.</v>

2837
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2838
01:12:03.450 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Speaker 4>They actually try to mute them.</v>

2839
01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.280
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people don't know that morning glory seeds actually contain what is the</v>

2840
01:12:10.771 --> 01:12:11.730
<v Speaker 4>active compound?</v>

2841
01:12:11.731 --> 01:12:14.370
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a cousin of LSD.</v>

2842
01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:15.241
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

2843
01:12:15.241 --> 01:12:18.330
<v Speaker 4>it's something psychoactive that's very closely related.</v>

2844
01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:20.400
<v Speaker 4>And what you would do would do is they would make it,</v>

2845
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:21.660
<v Speaker 4>they would take the morning glory seeds.</v>

2846
01:12:21.661 --> 01:12:22.410
<v Speaker 4>They would,</v>

2847
01:12:22.410 --> 01:12:27.270
<v Speaker 4>they would soak them and I think they would smash them and make a cake and bake</v>

2848
01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:27.590
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2849
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:29.460
<v Speaker 4>So they have Lsa ls,</v>

2850
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:31.410
<v Speaker 4>Lsa less surgical acid.</v>

2851
01:12:31.411 --> 01:12:31.621
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2852
01:12:31.621 --> 01:12:32.321
<v Speaker 4>Is that lower surgery?</v>

2853
01:12:32.321 --> 01:12:33.600
<v Speaker 4>Casad concentrated.</v>

2854
01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:34.200
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2855
01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:34.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2856
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:35.460
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2857
01:12:35.460 --> 01:12:37.280
<v Speaker 4>so when you fly this,</v>

2858
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:39.950
<v Speaker 4>they've engineered morning glory seeds.</v>

2859
01:12:39.980 --> 01:12:43.320
<v Speaker 4>Many of them to not be is psychoactive.</v>

2860
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:47.850
<v Speaker 4>They've done things to them because a lot of people in the 70s were getting high</v>

2861
01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:49.140
<v Speaker 4>off morning glory seeds.</v>

2862
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:49.411
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2863
01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:50.100
<v Speaker 4>isn't that funny?</v>

2864
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:50.341
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2865
01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:51.420
<v Speaker 4>Terence Mckenna,</v>

2866
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:54.390
<v Speaker 4>who's one of my favorite psychedelic authors,</v>

2867
01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:57.390
<v Speaker 4>that was his first psychedelic trip who was a young band.</v>

2868
01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:59.070
<v Speaker 4>He ate morning glory seeds.</v>

2869
01:12:59.071 --> 01:13:00.780
<v Speaker 4>He bought them and smashed them up.</v>

2870
01:13:00.781 --> 01:13:03.310
<v Speaker 4>Teens trying to get high sick and after eating flowers,</v>

2871
01:13:03.311 --> 01:13:04.144
<v Speaker 4>seeds</v>

2872
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:06.630
<v Speaker 4>today show what years that,</v>

2873
01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:07.493
<v Speaker 4>that's so funny.</v>

2874
01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:09.780
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2875
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:10.730
<v Speaker 4>They bought flowers.</v>

2876
01:13:10.731 --> 01:13:11.580
<v Speaker 4>Seeds recently.</v>

2877
01:13:11.610 --> 01:13:12.840
<v Speaker 4>They've probably heard me talk about it.</v>

2878
01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:13.681
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2879
01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:14.890
<v Speaker 4>that's baby rose.</v>

2880
01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:16.560
<v Speaker 4>That's a funny morning.</v>

2881
01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:16.891
<v Speaker 4>Glory.</v>

2882
01:13:16.891 --> 01:13:17.131
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2883
01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:17.341
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2884
01:13:17.341 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 4>Those are morning glory ones.</v>

2885
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:19.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2886
01:13:19.260 --> 01:13:19.740
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2887
01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.573
<v Speaker 4>but see,</v>

2888
01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:21.930
<v Speaker 4>smoking banana peels,</v>

2889
01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why they're getting sick.</v>

2890
01:13:24.330 --> 01:13:25.320
<v Speaker 4>They're probably pussies.</v>

2891
01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:26.880
<v Speaker 4>Too many little bitches.</v>

2892
01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:27.660
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2893
01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:31.080
<v Speaker 4>apparently these seeds contain [inaudible] surgical acid,</v>

2894
01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:32.730
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] LSA,</v>

2895
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.500
<v Speaker 4>which closely resembles LSD.</v>

2896
01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:37.140
<v Speaker 4>But see all of them don't have that.</v>

2897
01:13:37.141 --> 01:13:37.351
<v Speaker 4>No one.</v>

2898
01:13:37.351 --> 01:13:39.810
<v Speaker 4>They say they got sick with vomiting.</v>

2899
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.191
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2900
01:13:40.191 --> 01:13:40.870
<v Speaker 4>they had a bad trip.</v>

2901
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:41.820
<v Speaker 4>And introspection.</v>

2902
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.940
<v Speaker 4>Introspection is sickening.</v>

2903
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:45.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2904
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:47.190
<v Speaker 4>that's the worst part.</v>

2905
01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:49.591
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

2906
01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:51.870
<v Speaker 4>apparently that's how a lot of the Mayans,</v>

2907
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 4>a lot of the Mayans used to take Lsa.</v>

2908
01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:56.370
<v Speaker 4>They used to take this stuff.</v>

2909
01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:59.790
<v Speaker 4>They used to take morning glory seeds and Mckenna said that when he did it,</v>

2910
01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:02.260
<v Speaker 4>he saw a lot of uh,</v>

2911
01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:02.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2912
01:14:02.730 --> 01:14:06.540
<v Speaker 4>like classic Mayan iconography.</v>

2913
01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:10.020
<v Speaker 4>He saw like a lot of imagery till maybe that's just how it reacts with the</v>

2914
01:14:10.021 --> 01:14:10.590
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

2915
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:11.720
<v Speaker 4>It could a,</v>

2916
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:12.520
<v Speaker 4>there's sauce.</v>

2917
01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:12.820
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2918
01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:14.710
<v Speaker 4>that's a really plausible theory.</v>

2919
01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:18.480
<v Speaker 4>There's another theory that's a little more slippery and this one is a very woo</v>

2920
01:14:18.481 --> 01:14:19.000
<v Speaker 4>woo.</v>

2921
01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
<v Speaker 4>And the idea is that every experience that you have,</v>

2922
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:24.160
<v Speaker 4>like say if you take mushrooms,</v>

2923
01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:25.023
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

2924
01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:25.451
<v Speaker 4>every,</v>

2925
01:14:25.451 --> 01:14:26.710
<v Speaker 4>when you're eating mushrooms,</v>

2926
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:30.600
<v Speaker 4>you're not just having an experience where your brain is interacting with the</v>

2927
01:14:30.601 --> 01:14:31.181
<v Speaker 4>substance,</v>

2928
01:14:31.181 --> 01:14:36.181
<v Speaker 4>but you are in fact experiencing all of the people that have ever interacted</v>

2929
01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:38.440
<v Speaker 4>with this trip.</v>

2930
01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:39.601
<v Speaker 4>So that,</v>

2931
01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:43.360
<v Speaker 4>that's one of the reasons why silicide been is so potentially potent,</v>

2932
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.640
<v Speaker 4>is that you're not just accessing,</v>

2933
01:14:45.641 --> 01:14:47.500
<v Speaker 4>we're talking about morning glory seeds.</v>

2934
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:47.801
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2935
01:14:47.801 --> 01:14:48.280
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2936
01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.490
<v Speaker 4>And other people getting high on morning glory seeds and this was something that</v>

2937
01:14:51.491 --> 01:14:52.324
<v Speaker 4>the Mayans did.</v>

2938
01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:52.810
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>

2939
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:54.370
<v Speaker 4>I remember we did that when I was in high school.</v>

2940
01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:54.580
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2941
01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.410
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>

2942
01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:55.900
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2943
01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:58.380
<v Speaker 4>but their exit lanes lot the thought will,</v>

2944
01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:00.340
<v Speaker 4>the Mckenna was saying that when he did it,</v>

2945
01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:01.600
<v Speaker 4>he saw all this,</v>

2946
01:15:01.601 --> 01:15:02.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2947
01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:07.020
<v Speaker 4>I think he said either mine or a gypsum iconography saw a lot of like images</v>

2948
01:15:07.451 --> 01:15:10.660
<v Speaker 4>that were very similar to like these ancient civilizations.</v>

2949
01:15:10.661 --> 01:15:14.770
<v Speaker 4>And the thought is that either this is what's it's doing to your brain or the</v>

2950
01:15:14.771 --> 01:15:19.360
<v Speaker 4>more woo woo thought is that when you are having a psychedelic experience,</v>

2951
01:15:19.570 --> 01:15:22.000
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're consuming something like a fungus,</v>

2952
01:15:22.001 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 4>like a psilocybin,</v>

2953
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:27.190
<v Speaker 4>that you're not just having this experience where this chemicals interacting</v>

2954
01:15:27.191 --> 01:15:28.024
<v Speaker 4>with your brain,</v>

2955
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:31.690
<v Speaker 4>but you're entering into the realm of all the previous experiences that human</v>

2956
01:15:31.691 --> 01:15:32.590
<v Speaker 4>beings have had with this,</v>

2957
01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:37.330
<v Speaker 4>which is one of the reasons why silicide and has such a rich history.</v>

2958
01:15:37.570 --> 01:15:37.931
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2959
01:15:37.931 --> 01:15:38.290
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2960
01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:38.470
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2961
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:41.860
<v Speaker 4>these are incredibly potent experiences when you do take psilocybin.</v>

2962
01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:47.100
<v Speaker 4>And then also Iowasca I lost when you take that people see Jaguars and snakes</v>

2963
01:15:49.511 --> 01:15:50.410
<v Speaker 4>and all these different things.</v>

2964
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:53.710
<v Speaker 4>And so the thought behind that is that you are interacting with all the</v>

2965
01:15:53.711 --> 01:15:56.890
<v Speaker 4>experiences that all these different people have had with these,</v>

2966
01:15:56.891 --> 01:15:58.840
<v Speaker 4>with these various substances.</v>

2967
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:59.141
<v Speaker 4>Is it,</v>

2968
01:15:59.141 --> 01:16:00.880
<v Speaker 4>what's genetic inside you?</v>

2969
01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2970
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2971
01:16:02.411 --> 01:16:03.050
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

2972
01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:03.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2973
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:04.103
<v Speaker 4>it's all just stored.</v>

2974
01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:04.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2975
01:16:04.570 --> 01:16:06.190
<v Speaker 4>That's all just speculating.</v>

2976
01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:08.860
<v Speaker 4>But that what's interesting is that Mckenna said that,</v>

2977
01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2978
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:10.623
<v Speaker 4>ketamine,</v>

2979
01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:12.520
<v Speaker 4>which at the time when he was alive,</v>

2980
01:16:12.521 --> 01:16:13.420
<v Speaker 4>he died in the early,</v>

2981
01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:14.890
<v Speaker 4>I think early two thousands.</v>

2982
01:16:14.891 --> 01:16:15.724
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2983
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:18.250
<v Speaker 4>I think he died like early two thousands,</v>

2984
01:16:18.690 --> 01:16:19.390
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2985
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:24.310
<v Speaker 4>that ketamine was a weird drug to take cause it seemed like no one had taken it</v>

2986
01:16:24.311 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 4>yet that you would take it and it's like you were in an empty office building.</v>

2987
01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.190
<v Speaker 4>Like it's all built but there's no one in the building.</v>

2988
01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:34.920
<v Speaker 4>Whereas if you're taking LSD or if you're taking psilocybin,</v>

2989
01:16:34.930 --> 01:16:35.410
<v Speaker 4>you've this,</v>

2990
01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:37.900
<v Speaker 4>all these experiences that people had.</v>

2991
01:16:37.901 --> 01:16:42.901
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the drug itself or the compound itself absorbs the experiences of</v>

2992
01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:46.180
<v Speaker 4>the user and transfers them to the next users.</v>

2993
01:16:47.130 --> 01:16:47.581
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

2994
01:16:47.581 --> 01:16:48.790
<v Speaker 4>we will buy this.</v>

2995
01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:49.900
<v Speaker 4>I like that idea though.</v>

2996
01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:50.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2997
01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.790
<v Speaker 4>You do something that's as potent is like silicide and you,</v>

2998
01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:55.510
<v Speaker 4>you're open a fucking anything.</v>

2999
01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:56.920
<v Speaker 4>Like if that's possible,</v>

3000
01:16:56.921 --> 01:17:00.350
<v Speaker 4>if you can eat five grams of mushrooms and that happens like Goddamn it,</v>

3001
01:17:00.351 --> 01:17:00.501
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

3002
01:17:00.501 --> 01:17:01.450
<v Speaker 4>I'll take whatever you got.</v>

3003
01:17:01.451 --> 01:17:02.260
<v Speaker 4>What else you got?</v>

3004
01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:03.093
<v Speaker 4>What else do you tell me?</v>

3005
01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:04.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck this is.</v>

3006
01:17:04.421 --> 01:17:05.980
<v Speaker 4>Like what is this and that's,</v>

3007
01:17:05.981 --> 01:17:06.221
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3008
01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:06.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3009
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.561
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

3010
01:17:06.561 --> 01:17:10.460
<v Speaker 4>you talked about psilocybin can treat intractable depression.</v>

3011
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:11.160
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3012
01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 3>People take,</v>

3013
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>it opens up doors in your brain,</v>

3014
01:17:13.551 --> 01:17:14.121
<v Speaker 3>then you take it.</v>

3015
01:17:14.121 --> 01:17:16.970
<v Speaker 3>One will always stay close silicide trip.</v>

3016
01:17:16.971 --> 01:17:18.020
<v Speaker 3>And then for like six months,</v>

3017
01:17:18.021 --> 01:17:19.340
<v Speaker 3>their depression is completely gone.</v>

3018
01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:20.240
<v Speaker 3>And My,</v>

3019
01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:21.290
<v Speaker 3>my parents had a,</v>

3020
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:25.280
<v Speaker 3>had a friend who was a experimented on in Canada as a,</v>

3021
01:17:25.281 --> 01:17:26.114
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3022
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:27.260
<v Speaker 3>with the LSD.</v>

3023
01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.080
<v Speaker 3>So she lost her mind eventually.</v>

3024
01:17:30.081 --> 01:17:30.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3025
01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:30.591
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

3026
01:17:30.591 --> 01:17:31.280
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3027
01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.520
<v Speaker 3>she didn't know at the time he was in government.</v>

3028
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.940
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

3029
01:17:34.940 --> 01:17:37.100
<v Speaker 3>the CIA was experimenting on Canada,</v>

3030
01:17:37.101 --> 01:17:38.810
<v Speaker 3>on Canadians of course.</v>

3031
01:17:38.990 --> 01:17:42.570
<v Speaker 3>And she was wanting to get across that clearcut doleful Muslin.</v>

3032
01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:43.413
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3033
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:44.240
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

3034
01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Back then it was harder there.</v>

3035
01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:47.180
<v Speaker 3>There was a same rob.</v>

3036
01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3037
01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.553
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't get over it.</v>

3038
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:49.070
<v Speaker 3>That's his thing.</v>

3039
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.660
<v Speaker 3>They had,</v>

3040
01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:50.960
<v Speaker 3>they had the full cooperation of the,</v>

3041
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:53.090
<v Speaker 3>it was the defund Baker I think.</v>

3042
01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:53.950
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3043
01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:54.910
<v Speaker 3>He does know that Ted's kids,</v>

3044
01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:56.180
<v Speaker 3>NC swore the Unabomber.</v>

3045
01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.153
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3046
01:17:57.230 --> 01:17:58.790
<v Speaker 3>I know about the beauty bumper part.</v>

3047
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:02.080
<v Speaker 3>He was a part of the lst Harvard Studies Alessi he was in,</v>

3048
01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:03.770
<v Speaker 3>so this is kind of the same,</v>

3049
01:18:03.771 --> 01:18:04.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3050
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:04.730
<v Speaker 3>same deal.</v>

3051
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:05.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3052
01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.170
<v Speaker 3>They cooked that guy's brain.</v>

3053
01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:06.410
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3054
01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:06.921
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3055
01:18:06.921 --> 01:18:07.461
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

3056
01:18:07.461 --> 01:18:08.750
<v Speaker 3>there's a documentary about it.</v>

3057
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:09.620
<v Speaker 3>It's really interesting.</v>

3058
01:18:09.621 --> 01:18:14.240
<v Speaker 3>He was like a 16 year old kid when he first went to Harvard because he was so</v>

3059
01:18:14.241 --> 01:18:16.160
<v Speaker 3>fucking smart that uh,</v>

3060
01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:16.650
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

3061
01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:20.680
<v Speaker 3>it was entering to Harvard at 16 years of age and um,</v>

3062
01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.240
<v Speaker 3>there was a psychologist that,</v>

3063
01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:23.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3064
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:27.350
<v Speaker 3>was working at Harvard at the time that he is,</v>

3065
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:30.890
<v Speaker 3>he's been photograph with and was friends with and he was a part of this</v>

3066
01:18:30.891 --> 01:18:31.280
<v Speaker 3>program.</v>

3067
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:36.280
<v Speaker 3>This guy was notoriously ruthless with his application of Lsd to young people.</v>

3068
01:18:37.401 --> 01:18:37.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3069
01:18:37.581 --> 01:18:38.720
<v Speaker 3>he just gave it a shot.</v>

3070
01:18:38.750 --> 01:18:39.940
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what it does,</v>

3071
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:41.030
<v Speaker 3>fries them forever.</v>

3072
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:42.740
<v Speaker 3>But here's the thing,</v>

3073
01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:44.720
<v Speaker 3>and I've been thinking about this a lot lately.</v>

3074
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:47.510
<v Speaker 3>I think that he was on to something,</v>

3075
01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:49.890
<v Speaker 3>and this is what he was on to what he was onto.</v>

3076
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:53.180
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to kill people that were creating technology because he felt like</v>

3077
01:18:53.181 --> 01:18:55.280
<v Speaker 3>technology is going to be the end of humans.</v>

3078
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

3079
01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:56.773
<v Speaker 3>He's right.</v>

3080
01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:57.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3081
01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:58.433
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3082
01:18:59.410 --> 01:18:59.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3083
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3084
01:18:59.900 --> 01:19:00.733
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3085
01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:02.920
<v Speaker 3>Definitely as fuck on acid.</v>

3086
01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:06.170
<v Speaker 3>Then probably gave him a fucking coffee cup full of acid at 16.</v>

3087
01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3088
01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean who knows how much they were.</v>

3089
01:19:07.671 --> 01:19:09.380
<v Speaker 3>They didn't know what the doses were.</v>

3090
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:11.060
<v Speaker 3>They were just experimenting with people.</v>

3091
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.280
<v Speaker 3>Cause I,</v>

3092
01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.520
<v Speaker 3>Ken Keyes leary role part of that.</v>

3093
01:19:13.521 --> 01:19:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

3094
01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:14.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3095
01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:15.141
<v Speaker 3>A few weeks ago,</v>

3096
01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:17.690
<v Speaker 3>and I read an article online and at the bottom it said,</v>

3097
01:19:17.691 --> 01:19:19.330
<v Speaker 3>this article has been written by a,</v>

3098
01:19:19.331 --> 01:19:20.164
<v Speaker 3>a program,</v>

3099
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:21.440
<v Speaker 3>not by human.</v>

3100
01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3101
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.230
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3102
01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3103
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3104
01:19:23.240 --> 01:19:23.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3105
01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:24.820
<v Speaker 3>I arts paint,</v>

3106
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:25.723
<v Speaker 3>paintings,</v>

3107
01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.380
<v Speaker 3>paintings done by Ai.</v>

3108
01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:29.090
<v Speaker 3>Like a symphony.</v>

3109
01:19:29.091 --> 01:19:29.241
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3110
01:19:29.241 --> 01:19:30.910
<v Speaker 3>he lives in Bombay on what's happening.</v>

3111
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.620
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3112
01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:32.720
<v Speaker 3>it's coming in it now.</v>

3113
01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:37.700
<v Speaker 3>Once they figure out a way to make a reality that's indiscernible from the</v>

3114
01:19:37.701 --> 01:19:39.170
<v Speaker 3>reality that we're currently experiencing,</v>

3115
01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:40.004
<v Speaker 3>which is just,</v>

3116
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.180
<v Speaker 3>it's around the corner.</v>

3117
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:41.351
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3118
01:19:41.351 --> 01:19:42.184
<v Speaker 3>That's only like,</v>

3119
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:46.220
<v Speaker 3>or happened 2 billion years ago and we're just living in it.</v>

3120
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:48.590
<v Speaker 3>Only know what's in front of you.</v>

3121
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:49.731
<v Speaker 3>And you know what I mean?</v>

3122
01:19:49.731 --> 01:19:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3123
01:19:50.010 --> 01:19:50.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3124
01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:50.900
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3125
01:19:50.900 --> 01:19:52.040
<v Speaker 3>and if you've done the,</v>

3126
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.551
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3127
01:19:52.551 --> 01:19:53.384
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3128
01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:54.351
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3129
01:19:54.351 --> 01:19:54.711
<v Speaker 3>what is it,</v>

3130
01:19:54.711 --> 01:19:56.210
<v Speaker 3>the oculus stuff and all that.</v>

3131
01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:00.470
<v Speaker 3>I mean we have a HTC vive and the back and see hazing.</v>

3132
01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:01.280
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3133
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:01.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3134
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:02.150
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

3135
01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 3>But your emotions,</v>

3136
01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:04.124
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>

3137
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:04.963
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're there.</v>

3138
01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:05.893
<v Speaker 3>It's no different.</v>

3139
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.620
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3140
01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:07.361
<v Speaker 3>It's very similar.</v>

3141
01:20:07.361 --> 01:20:08.850
<v Speaker 3>There's one where you jump off a building.</v>

3142
01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:09.780
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever tried that one?</v>

3143
01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:10.290
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3144
01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:14.700
<v Speaker 3>You go out in the diving board and a on a high rise and step off.</v>

3145
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:15.151
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3146
01:20:15.151 --> 01:20:15.600
<v Speaker 3>well they are.</v>

3147
01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.660
<v Speaker 3>They're using it to treat PTSD</v>

3148
01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:20.293
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

3149
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:24.020
<v Speaker 3>it's going to happen yet.</v>

3150
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 3>Once they figure out a way to give you some experiences that you can't tell</v>

3151
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:31.020
<v Speaker 3>whether or not those experiences or were real or not,</v>

3152
01:20:31.290 --> 01:20:32.970
<v Speaker 3>then the aliens or feel they'll,</v>

3153
01:20:33.150 --> 01:20:35.580
<v Speaker 3>they'll land and they'll interact.</v>

3154
01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.110
<v Speaker 3>It is really is the matrix,</v>

3155
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:42.260
<v Speaker 3>but I think that artificial life and art and an intelligence that is sentient,</v>

3156
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:45.030
<v Speaker 3>that is also completely autonomous,</v>

3157
01:20:45.031 --> 01:20:46.830
<v Speaker 3>that can run itself and decide for itself.</v>

3158
01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:48.630
<v Speaker 3>It's only a matter of time.</v>

3159
01:20:49.170 --> 01:20:50.310
<v Speaker 3>It's not a matter of,</v>

3160
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:54.510
<v Speaker 3>this is not like hg wells science fiction 200 years ago.</v>

3161
01:20:54.511 --> 01:20:55.530
<v Speaker 3>Like we're just guessing.</v>

3162
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.720
<v Speaker 3>This is like you could see it coming.</v>

3163
01:20:57.750 --> 01:20:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3164
01:20:58.350 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 3>They already have machine learning.</v>

3165
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:03.900
<v Speaker 3>They already have certain artificial intelligence that guesses certain things</v>

3166
01:21:03.901 --> 01:21:04.950
<v Speaker 3>about you and,</v>

3167
01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.260
<v Speaker 3>but Siri is still a dumb cunt.</v>

3168
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:08.941
<v Speaker 3>What's better?</v>

3169
01:21:08.941 --> 01:21:09.500
<v Speaker 3>Big Spear.</v>

3170
01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:10.930
<v Speaker 3>Siri tried Bixby.</v>

3171
01:21:11.650 --> 01:21:14.790
<v Speaker 3>Is Samsung's version of Siri yet?</v>

3172
01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:16.440
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>

3173
01:21:16.441 --> 01:21:17.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3174
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.530
<v Speaker 3>That's all.</v>

3175
01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:18.151
<v Speaker 3>Never use it.</v>

3176
01:21:18.151 --> 01:21:19.210
<v Speaker 3>I have a sense on the phone.</v>

3177
01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.040
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3178
01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.180
<v Speaker 3>It's incredibly effective yet,</v>

3179
01:21:21.181 --> 01:21:22.020
<v Speaker 3>but it has a terrible voice.</v>

3180
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Kept that button to map it out to anything else.</v>

3181
01:21:25.170 --> 01:21:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Is it the voice of Bill Beck speak?</v>

3182
01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:27.430
<v Speaker 3>Cause that'd be really cool.</v>

3183
01:21:27.431 --> 01:21:27.781
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3184

3187
01:21:36.451 --> 01:21:37.284
<v Speaker 3>I'd never</v>

3188
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:43.170
<v Speaker 3>utility and did the end forgot about that.</v>

3189
01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:43.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3190
01:21:43.441 --> 01:21:46.170

3191
01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:46.960
<v Speaker 3>but he never,</v>

3192
01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3193

3197
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.910
<v Speaker 3>She seems real nice.</v>

3198
01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:51.270
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

3199
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:52.560
<v Speaker 3>She seems lonely too.</v>

3200
01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.520
<v Speaker 3>Seeing what's right in front of you.</v>

3201
01:21:56.521 --> 01:21:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Didn't get it.</v>

3202
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:57.301
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3203
01:21:57.301 --> 01:21:58.530
<v Speaker 3>how will you not with her man?</v>

3204
01:21:58.531 --> 01:21:59.970
<v Speaker 3>She's so nice to your kid.</v>

3205
01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.740
<v Speaker 3>You guys are biggest sweet family.</v>

3206
01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:03.640
<v Speaker 3>Very Long.</v>

3207
01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.473
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3208
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.690
<v Speaker 3>maybe if he'd gotten like five or six more seasons,</v>

3209
01:22:06.770 --> 01:22:08.100
<v Speaker 3>whoever is on Netflix or something.</v>

3210
01:22:08.101 --> 01:22:08.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3211
01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:09.480
<v Speaker 3>it would have pushed that angle.</v>

3212
01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3213
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.240
<v Speaker 3>I started watching a magician a little bit.</v>

3214
01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:13.340
<v Speaker 3>You've seen that?</v>

3215
01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.200
<v Speaker 3>What does that speak show?</v>

3216
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

3217
01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:16.330
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

3218
01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:17.130
<v Speaker 3>One of the worst of all,</v>

3219
01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:20.310
<v Speaker 3>it was one of the CBS movie mysteries.</v>

3220
01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:23.930
<v Speaker 3>It was like with Colombo and was terrible on every level.</v>

3221
01:22:24.330 --> 01:22:24.481
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3222
01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:25.314
<v Speaker 3>He was the magician.</v>

3223
01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:28.980
<v Speaker 3>He was his magic to solve crimes would know what the Magic,</v>

3224
01:22:29.370 --> 01:22:29.491
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3225
01:22:29.491 --> 01:22:30.240
<v Speaker 3>that's hilarious.</v>

3226
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:30.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3227
01:22:30.630 --> 01:22:31.920
<v Speaker 3>How do you solve crimes with magic?</v>

3228
01:22:31.921 --> 01:22:33.930
<v Speaker 3>You don't do magic.</v>

3229
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3230
01:22:34.410 --> 01:22:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3231
01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.080
<v Speaker 3>and you pretend you're solving crimes and then someone else solves a crime.</v>

3232
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:37.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3233
01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:38.550
<v Speaker 3>It was probably a producer's idea.</v>

3234
01:22:38.551 --> 01:22:39.150
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3235
01:22:39.150 --> 01:22:39.470
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

3236
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.660
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3237
01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:40.860
<v Speaker 3>I got to like match guys.</v>

3238
01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Here's the show.</v>

3239
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:43.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm a magician who solves crime.</v>

3240
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.903
<v Speaker 3>Sell it.</v>

3241
01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:45.931
<v Speaker 3>I've got another meeting,</v>

3242
01:22:45.931 --> 01:22:47.190
<v Speaker 3>I've got to go and he leaves.</v>

3243
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:49.363
<v Speaker 3>I got to show it.</v>

3244
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:50.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3245
01:22:50.850 --> 01:22:52.110
<v Speaker 3>I had a pit crews.</v>

3246
01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:53.220
<v Speaker 3>They gave me a pitch once.</v>

3247
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:53.510
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3248
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.050
<v Speaker 3>it was a guy who was immortal.</v>

3249
01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:56.640
<v Speaker 3>He was an Egyptian.</v>

3250
01:22:57.030 --> 01:22:58.290
<v Speaker 3>This was a pitch to me.</v>

3251
01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.750
<v Speaker 3>It was going to play this guy who was a mortal far.</v>

3252
01:23:00.751 --> 01:23:01.560
<v Speaker 3>It's good casting.</v>

3253
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:01.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3254
01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:02.593
<v Speaker 3>Mortal.</v>

3255
01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:04.100
<v Speaker 3>He got,</v>

3256
01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:05.320
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3257
01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.220
<v Speaker 3>Happened back then.</v>

3258
01:23:06.221 --> 01:23:09.310
<v Speaker 3>And a woman put a curse on me because I was like banging her sister or something</v>

3259
01:23:09.311 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

3260
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:10.833
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

3261
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 3>the curse was that you would live forever.</v>

3262
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:14.860
<v Speaker 3>So here I was,</v>

3263
01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 3>many thousands of years later,</v>

3264
01:23:16.271 --> 01:23:19.450
<v Speaker 3>I had to pretend that I was a regular person and I could never die.</v>

3265
01:23:19.451 --> 01:23:20.680
<v Speaker 3>And that was the Sitcom.</v>

3266
01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:21.850
<v Speaker 3>It was calm.</v>

3267
01:23:21.850 --> 01:23:22.683
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3268
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:23.580
<v Speaker 3>it was a sitcom.</v>

3269
01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:25.660
<v Speaker 3>It was the dumbest idea I've ever heard in my life.</v>

3270
01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:26.021
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

3271
01:23:26.021 --> 01:23:28.540
<v Speaker 3>As a one hour to solve crimes,</v>

3272
01:23:28.541 --> 01:23:28.950
<v Speaker 3>because I know,</v>

3273
01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:31.180
<v Speaker 3>I knew it was going to be a problem when I met the guy and he was wearing</v>

3274
01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:31.811
<v Speaker 3>bowling shoes,</v>

3275
01:23:31.811 --> 01:23:32.830
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't going bowling.</v>

3276
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:35.880
<v Speaker 3>That means ask those fuckers</v>

3277
01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:38.643
<v Speaker 3>shoes.</v>

3278
01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.360
<v Speaker 3>My shoes are interesting.</v>

3279
01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:41.261
<v Speaker 3>Wait a second.</v>

3280
01:23:41.261 --> 01:23:42.094
<v Speaker 3>I used to do that.</v>

3281
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:44.201
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3282
01:23:44.201 --> 01:23:46.240
<v Speaker 3>do you remember when there was the writer teams,</v>

3283
01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:48.730
<v Speaker 3>but it was always the one guy who was the typer and the other guy was really</v>

3284
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:49.560
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

3285
01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:50.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3286
01:23:50.230 --> 01:23:54.040
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of those teams and those teams would branch off and one of those</v>

3287
01:23:54.041 --> 01:23:56.260
<v Speaker 3>guys would get a lot of money and then the,</v>

3288
01:23:56.261 --> 01:23:56.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3289
01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:59.730
<v Speaker 3>they were the time you got the wrong guy,</v>

3290
01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.073
<v Speaker 3>paid the fucking,</v>

3291
01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:02.700
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3292
01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:03.610
<v Speaker 3>we paid the typer.</v>

3293
01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.320
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of that with the teams.</v>

3294
01:24:05.321 --> 01:24:09.370
<v Speaker 3>The teams always seem to be like one really talented person who's kind of may be</v>

3295
01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:10.750
<v Speaker 3>introspective and weird.</v>

3296
01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:11.890
<v Speaker 3>And I eventually figured out,</v>

3297
01:24:11.891 --> 01:24:12.011
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3298
01:24:12.011 --> 01:24:15.460
<v Speaker 3>I can just hire a typist and he got rid of that guy.</v>

3299
01:24:15.461 --> 01:24:16.900
<v Speaker 3>But then that guy got a big development deal.</v>

3300
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Remember development deals.</v>

3301
01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:19.991
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

3302
01:24:19.991 --> 01:24:20.860
<v Speaker 3>I had so many of them.</v>

3303
01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:27.940
<v Speaker 3>I had one one year where they gave me a shit ton of money and we never did</v>

3304
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:28.803
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

3305
01:24:29.470 --> 01:24:31.480
<v Speaker 3>All the money I had three months,</v>

3306
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.760
<v Speaker 3>I had about four right after news radio.</v>

3307
01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:34.260
<v Speaker 3>Did you?</v>

3308
01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:35.093
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3309
01:24:35.140 --> 01:24:38.110
<v Speaker 3>And they create smaller and smaller networks each time.</v>

3310
01:24:38.650 --> 01:24:38.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3311
01:24:38.881 --> 01:24:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3312
01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:40.120
<v Speaker 3>You get down to the CW,</v>

3313
01:24:40.121 --> 01:24:41.020
<v Speaker 3>you know you've got an issue.</v>

3314
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:42.700
<v Speaker 3>I might have to actually write something.</v>

3315
01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:43.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3316
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:44.590
<v Speaker 3>no cooking channel.</v>

3317
01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:46.750
<v Speaker 3>So what is this obsessing?</v>

3318
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:48.080
<v Speaker 3>What is your,</v>

3319
01:24:48.110 --> 01:24:51.070
<v Speaker 3>your more recent obsessing about Ufo was,</v>

3320
01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:52.060
<v Speaker 3>what's the origin of this?</v>

3321
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Part of it is just the fact that that the evidence,</v>

3322
01:24:57.310 --> 01:25:01.180
<v Speaker 3>just the evidence itself says you have to take this seriously and yet no one</v>

3323
01:25:01.181 --> 01:25:03.130
<v Speaker 3>does a or very,</v>

3324
01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:03.881
<v Speaker 3>very few people do.</v>

3325
01:25:03.881 --> 01:25:05.680
<v Speaker 3>And even like the,</v>

3326
01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:09.640
<v Speaker 3>again that [inaudible] 16 footage that even Neil degrasse Tyson who is a great</v>

3327
01:25:09.641 --> 01:25:11.200
<v Speaker 3>skeptic said,</v>

3328

3330
01:25:13.540 --> 01:25:13.751
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3331
01:25:13.751 --> 01:25:13.841
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3332
01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:16.810
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to look at the possibility of some,</v>

3333
01:25:17.230 --> 01:25:18.760
<v Speaker 3>a non human intelligence,</v>

3334
01:25:18.761 --> 01:25:21.460
<v Speaker 3>that f 16 stuff is pretty compelling.</v>

3335
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>What is the episode STD stuff?</v>

3336
01:25:24.190 --> 01:25:24.961
<v Speaker 3>That's the stuff that,</v>

3337
01:25:24.961 --> 01:25:25.360
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3338
01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:26.800
<v Speaker 3>to the stars academy put out.</v>

3339
01:25:26.801 --> 01:25:28.660
<v Speaker 3>It was the CIA Tom Delonge.</v>

3340
01:25:29.050 --> 01:25:29.883
<v Speaker 3>He's crazy,</v>

3341
01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:31.540
<v Speaker 3>but I had never met on the podcast.</v>

3342
01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3343

<v Speaker 3>What do you see?</v>

3345
01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:38.140
<v Speaker 3>And he said she's a very nice guy and a brilliant musician and he's a loon.</v>

3346
01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:38.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3347
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:41.440
<v Speaker 3>I've never met a fucking full on believer.</v>

3348
01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean he left blink one 82 to go do this to the stars academy.</v>

3349
01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:46.181
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>

3350
01:25:46.181 --> 01:25:48.550
<v Speaker 3>he said the biggest Goddamn rock band on the planet.</v>

3351
01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:49.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3352
01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:54.330
<v Speaker 3>Here's something interesting about this and this was pointed out like by,</v>

3353
01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:55.913
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3354
01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:56.501
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3355
01:25:56.501 --> 01:26:01.000
<v Speaker 3>A film video film by fighter jet shows an unknown object near San Diego video</v>

3356
01:26:01.001 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 3>from 2004 was released by the US Department of Defense.</v>

3357
01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:05.473
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3358
01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 4>while the way it moves,</v>

3359
01:26:07.850 --> 01:26:10.100
<v Speaker 4>there's something about the way it moves is really weird.</v>

3360
01:26:10.101 --> 01:26:10.520
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

3361
01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:11.590
<v Speaker 4>Can't yet though.</v>

3362
01:26:12.690 --> 01:26:15.620
<v Speaker 4>One of the pilots told the you immediate the object was not from this world.</v>

3363
01:26:15.910 --> 01:26:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

3364
01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:17.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3365
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.541
<v Speaker 4>And here's the thing.</v>

3366
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:18.291
<v Speaker 4>It's like the skeptics,</v>

3367
01:26:18.291 --> 01:26:19.580
<v Speaker 4>in order to dismiss it,</v>

3368
01:26:19.581 --> 01:26:21.070
<v Speaker 4>they have to go well event.</v>

3369
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:22.820
<v Speaker 4>They have to make arguments like that.</v>

3370
01:26:22.821 --> 01:26:25.880
<v Speaker 4>Jet Fighters are not better observers than anyone else.</v>

3371
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:29.120
<v Speaker 4>Pull up Mick wards take on that mic ward,</v>

3372
01:26:29.121 --> 01:26:30.770
<v Speaker 4>the guy who he runs deep,</v>

3373
01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:31.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3374
01:26:31.410 --> 01:26:31.670
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3375
01:26:31.670 --> 01:26:32.131
<v Speaker 4>what does it met?</v>

3376
01:26:32.131 --> 01:26:36.800
<v Speaker 4>A bunk metabolic can runs a debunking site and he's another one of those guys</v>

3377
01:26:36.801 --> 01:26:38.930
<v Speaker 4>that is all in with the,</v>

3378
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:45.200
<v Speaker 4>the conventional explanation goes way out of his way to not look at anything</v>

3379
01:26:45.201 --> 01:26:47.580
<v Speaker 4>that could be blockers.</v>

3380
01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:48.471
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3381
01:26:48.471 --> 01:26:48.830
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

3382
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:49.760
<v Speaker 4>Comes Razor says,</v>

3383
01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:54.620
<v Speaker 4>you know that if you have to go to great lengths to dismiss something,</v>

3384
01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

3385
01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:55.760
<v Speaker 4>that's not falling.</v>

3386
01:26:55.760 --> 01:27:00.290
<v Speaker 4>Ockham's razor Ockham's razor says if the jet pilot says he saw this,</v>

3387
01:27:00.291 --> 01:27:01.124
<v Speaker 4>he saw it.</v>

3388
01:27:01.190 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 4>I think he had an interesting take on it though.</v>

3389
01:27:03.201 --> 01:27:07.640
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things is there's a time during the video where the pilot shifted</v>

3390
01:27:07.641 --> 01:27:09.950
<v Speaker 4>from one x to two x,</v>

3391
01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.030
<v Speaker 4>which makes the image move more because you're,</v>

3392
01:27:14.031 --> 01:27:15.110
<v Speaker 4>you have magnification.</v>

3393
01:27:15.111 --> 01:27:20.090
<v Speaker 4>Like have you ever used magnifying glasses by knows like if you use a 15 x by</v>

3394
01:27:20.091 --> 01:27:22.010
<v Speaker 4>knows it's very difficult to hold in the state yet,</v>

3395
01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:22.933
<v Speaker 4>but six,</v>

3396
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:23.391
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

3397
01:27:23.391 --> 01:27:24.920
<v Speaker 4>you can kind of look at things in the distance.</v>

3398
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:25.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3399
01:27:25.670 --> 01:27:26.031
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

3400
01:27:26.031 --> 01:27:27.990
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have about,</v>

3401
01:27:27.991 --> 01:27:28.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3402
01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:32.630
<v Speaker 4>about $3 million worth of stabilization equipment on your jet walked on to this</v>

3403
01:27:32.631 --> 01:27:33.051
<v Speaker 4>object.</v>

3404
01:27:33.051 --> 01:27:33.560
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3405
01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.330
<v Speaker 4>Which is why that stays in Loc.</v>

3406
01:27:35.540 --> 01:27:37.550
<v Speaker 4>He had an explanation though that was kind of interesting.</v>

3407
01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:41.210
<v Speaker 4>And when it breaks free of the lock and how does that got unbelievable.</v>

3408
01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:43.010
<v Speaker 4>Just take off or something like that.</v>

3409
01:27:43.011 --> 01:27:43.341
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

3410
01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:44.090
<v Speaker 4>at one point just the,</v>

3411
01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:47.900
<v Speaker 4>you just breaks free the lock and that's almost impossible.</v>

3412
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:52.010
<v Speaker 4>I have a glide sound possible for anything that manage bills to do what?</v>

3413
01:27:52.011 --> 01:27:54.020
<v Speaker 4>The quality of cameras today.</v>

3414
01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Why is this footage so shitty?</v>

3415
01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:57.410
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3416
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:59.150
<v Speaker 4>that this is infrared footage footage?</v>

3417
01:27:59.160 --> 01:27:59.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3418
01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:00.011
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3419
01:28:00.011 --> 01:28:00.231
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3420
01:28:00.231 --> 01:28:00.891
<v Speaker 4>do you need this?</v>

3421
01:28:00.891 --> 01:28:02.210
<v Speaker 4>When you're shooting at things in the sky,</v>

3422
01:28:02.211 --> 01:28:03.530
<v Speaker 4>you can't rely on [inaudible].</v>

3423
01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:05.630
<v Speaker 4>When you're looking at heat,</v>

3424
01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.490
<v Speaker 4>you can't hate sickness visually.</v>

3425
01:28:07.491 --> 01:28:08.180
<v Speaker 4>It's so far.</v>

3426
01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.350
<v Speaker 4>It's so far.</v>

3427
01:28:09.351 --> 01:28:11.150
<v Speaker 4>It would be the rabbit hole.</v>

3428
01:28:11.151 --> 01:28:13.870
<v Speaker 4>How to debunk conspiracy theories using fact logic and research.</v>

3429
01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:14.960
<v Speaker 4>So what is he saying?</v>

3430
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.423
<v Speaker 4>What is he saying?</v>

3433
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:22.310
<v Speaker 4>He said a for all.</v>

3434
01:28:22.311 --> 01:28:24.500
<v Speaker 4>We made sure you are talking about the right video.</v>

3435
01:28:24.501 --> 01:28:26.780
<v Speaker 4>There's two that are confused here.</v>

3436
01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:28.220
<v Speaker 4>We're talking about the gimbal video,</v>

3437
01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:30.410
<v Speaker 4>which is not from the Nimitz incident.</v>

3438
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:31.460
<v Speaker 4>Just discussed here.</v>

3439
01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:32.720
<v Speaker 4>So scroll down a little bit.</v>

3440
01:28:34.330 --> 01:28:34.610
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3441
01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 4>the gimbal video is an okay.</v>

3442
01:28:36.861 --> 01:28:37.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3443
01:28:37.041 --> 01:28:37.970
<v Speaker 4>that's the one we're looking at.</v>

3444
01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:41.810
<v Speaker 4>It's an unknown date and location from an up from unknown pilots.</v>

3445
01:28:41.811 --> 01:28:42.380
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

3446
01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 4>The tick tock one are young pilots.</v>

3447
01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:45.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3448
01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.910
<v Speaker 4>that's 2004.</v>

3449
01:28:46.911 --> 01:28:47.121
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3450
01:28:47.121 --> 01:28:48.200
<v Speaker 4>That's David forever.</v>

3451
01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:48.950
<v Speaker 4>The media is discussed.</v>

3452
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:49.783
<v Speaker 4>These videos,</v>

3453
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:52.040
<v Speaker 4>Tom Delonge to the stars.</v>

3454
01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:53.720
<v Speaker 4>The link contains the frames.</v>

3455
01:28:53.721 --> 01:28:54.554
<v Speaker 4>What's he saying?</v>

3456
01:28:55.190 --> 01:28:55.791
<v Speaker 4>Keep going.</v>

3457
01:28:55.791 --> 01:28:56.301
<v Speaker 4>Keep going.</v>

3458
01:28:56.301 --> 01:28:57.134
<v Speaker 4>Keep going.</v>

3459
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:58.400
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3460
01:28:58.401 --> 01:28:59.690
<v Speaker 4>the black shape or on the object.</v>

3461
01:28:59.691 --> 01:29:02.400
<v Speaker 4>Some kind of infrared flare glare.</v>

3462
01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:05.730
<v Speaker 3>We know that the shape of a very bright infrared source,</v>

3463
01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:09.690
<v Speaker 3>like the engine of a plane can be much bigger than the object itself is</v>

3464
01:29:09.691 --> 01:29:10.200
<v Speaker 3>explained here.</v>

3465
01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:10.501
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

3466
01:29:10.501 --> 01:29:13.150
<v Speaker 3>so this is like a flare that that'll explain the move.</v>

3467
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:14.063
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3468
01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:16.110
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't explain again.</v>

3469
01:29:16.111 --> 01:29:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Ockham's razor is,</v>

3470
01:29:18.090 --> 01:29:18.361
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3471
01:29:18.361 --> 01:29:19.194
<v Speaker 3>so this guy does,</v>

3472
01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:22.170
<v Speaker 3>this guy is saying it looks nothing like it.</v>

3473
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3474
01:29:24.210 --> 01:29:25.230
<v Speaker 3>even if it is a jet,</v>

3475
01:29:25.270 --> 01:29:28.380
<v Speaker 3>a chats not capable of breaking free from the lock,</v>

3476
01:29:28.381 --> 01:29:28.650
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3477
01:29:28.650 --> 01:29:29.461
<v Speaker 3>To lock onto it.</v>

3478
01:29:29.461 --> 01:29:30.420
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at that,</v>

3479
01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:31.800
<v Speaker 3>you can see the jet,</v>

3480
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.360
<v Speaker 3>his own example.</v>

3481
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:34.350
<v Speaker 3>Debunks is debunking.</v>

3482
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Need not be moving.</v>

3483
01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:37.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3484
01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:38.850
<v Speaker 3>The video need not be moving.</v>

3485
01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:44.320
<v Speaker 3>The assumption that this guy doing probably a few hours research has come up</v>

3486
01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 3>with something that is more credible than a trained fighter pilot who was there</v>

3487
01:29:49.951 --> 01:29:51.000
<v Speaker 3>and visually seeing it.</v>

3488
01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:53.040
<v Speaker 3>What do you think it and tracking if you had to guess.</v>

3489
01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:53.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3490
01:29:53.960 --> 01:29:54.793
<v Speaker 3>Let's get crazy.</v>

3491
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>

3492
01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:56.820
<v Speaker 3>It is another,</v>

3493
01:29:56.820 --> 01:30:01.200
<v Speaker 3>it is an intelligent craft is a craft being piloted intelligently.</v>

3494
01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Why aren't they talking to us?</v>

3495

01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:48.840
<v Speaker 3>those were the days we thought that they would communicate like it wasn't there</v>

3571
01:31:48.850 --> 01:31:52.320
<v Speaker 3>a whole rash of them that were seen over Washington DC.</v>

<v Speaker 3>he has,</v>

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3580
01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:01.620
<v Speaker 2>essentially,</v>

3581
01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:03.160
<v Speaker 2>and then at the end of their explanation was,</v>

3582
01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:03.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3583
01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:04.150
<v Speaker 2>Nothing,</v>

3584
01:32:04.150 --> 01:32:06.130
<v Speaker 2>nothing particularly important.</v>

3585
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:06.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3586
01:32:06.670 --> 01:32:08.740
<v Speaker 2>we have a mutual friend who claims,</v>

3587
01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I won't say her name but she can now cause I,</v>

3588
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I wrote her off as a lunatic when I first started it.</v>

3589
01:32:13.531 --> 01:32:13.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3590
01:32:13.631 --> 01:32:17.260
<v Speaker 2>Well she was claiming to be adopted and then I,</v>

3591
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:20.740
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a show with her years ago and she just telling us the story.</v>

3592
01:32:21.130 --> 01:32:21.641
<v Speaker 2>We're all like a,</v>

3593
01:32:21.641 --> 01:32:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

3594
01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:22.571
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty funny.</v>

3595
01:32:22.571 --> 01:32:22.961
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

3596
01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:27.130
<v Speaker 2>and then they took a scoop out of my back and I'm like a scoop.</v>

3597
01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:31.240
<v Speaker 2>They took a scoop out of your back and she showed on her back shoulder.</v>

3598
01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:32.890
<v Speaker 2>There was a hexagon,</v>

3599
01:32:32.891 --> 01:32:35.500
<v Speaker 2>old diamond shaped scoop out of her back.</v>

3600
01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:37.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3601
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:39.660
<v Speaker 2>a divot that hexagon.</v>

3602
01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.301
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3603
01:32:40.301 --> 01:32:41.680
<v Speaker 2>That was clearly,</v>

3604
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:44.020
<v Speaker 2>clearly and no scar tissue.</v>

3605
01:32:44.050 --> 01:32:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Maybe she's a crazy bitch.</v>

3606
01:32:45.071 --> 01:32:46.870
<v Speaker 2>No scar tissue man know how to make this story.</v>

3607
01:32:47.470 --> 01:32:48.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3608
01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 2>give myself a little punch,</v>

3609
01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.150
<v Speaker 2>but I have a hole punch back there.</v>

3610
01:32:51.610 --> 01:32:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Worked at a bookstore at the time years ago when I went into the alien section</v>

3611
01:32:55.811 --> 01:32:57.320
<v Speaker 2>was the world's biggest bookstore in Toronto.</v>

3612
01:32:57.321 --> 01:32:58.154
<v Speaker 2>It was the name of it.</v>

3613
01:32:58.270 --> 01:33:01.390
<v Speaker 2>And of course I went to the alien section and just look all this crap up</v>

3614
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:02.291
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

3615
01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:04.390
<v Speaker 2>And there are other people with the scope.</v>

3616
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Well there's a lot of other people with stories and some of them have like</v>

3617
01:33:09.431 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 2>little pieces of something in their body.</v>

3618
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:13.150
<v Speaker 2>I remember you talking to me about this many,</v>

3619
01:33:13.151 --> 01:33:13.781
<v Speaker 2>many years ago.</v>

3620
01:33:13.781 --> 01:33:14.071
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3621
01:33:14.071 --> 01:33:15.430
<v Speaker 2>oh well Dave's interested.</v>

3622
01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 2>It was like implants.</v>

3623
01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:20.080
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about people that have alien implants in their body.</v>

3624
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.903
<v Speaker 2>And that's the things I,</v>

3625
01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:22.833
<v Speaker 2>to me it's just,</v>

3626
01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:28.120
<v Speaker 2>I guess the thing that I'm kind of obsessed with now is just the cause we're</v>

3627
01:33:28.121 --> 01:33:28.870
<v Speaker 2>comedians.</v>

3628
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:29.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3629
01:33:29.410 --> 01:33:31.570
<v Speaker 2>And the power of ridicule,</v>

3630
01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:32.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3631
01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:33.730
<v Speaker 2>to silence,</v>

3632
01:33:33.731 --> 01:33:36.130
<v Speaker 2>debate is unbelievably potent.</v>

3633
01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:36.760
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3634
01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.020
<v Speaker 2>And we're part of that.</v>

3635
01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.570
<v Speaker 2>We're part of the machinery that was used very,</v>

3636
01:33:40.571 --> 01:33:45.430
<v Speaker 2>very consciously by the government to silence any inquiry.</v>

3637
01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.121
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3638
01:33:46.121 --> 01:33:46.570
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>

3639
01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:46.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3640
01:33:46.781 --> 01:33:47.400
<v Speaker 2>feeding it,</v>

3641
01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3642
01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:52.680
<v Speaker 2>feeding the story the right way to late night talk show hosts made it so that</v>

3643
01:33:53.171 --> 01:33:54.340
<v Speaker 2>nobody would talk about it.</v>

3644
01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:58.210
<v Speaker 2>So do you think that the government consciously fed those ideas to like Johnny</v>

3645
01:33:58.210 --> 01:33:59.043
<v Speaker 2>Carson and those folks?</v>

3646
01:33:59.830 --> 01:34:01.030
<v Speaker 2>There's documentation of a,</v>

3647
01:34:01.031 --> 01:34:01.660
<v Speaker 2>of a pro,</v>

3648
01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:02.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3649
01:34:02.110 --> 01:34:03.160
<v Speaker 2>of that they,</v>

3650
01:34:03.161 --> 01:34:03.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3651
01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:04.391
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

3652
01:34:04.391 --> 01:34:05.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3653
01:34:05.170 --> 01:34:08.740
<v Speaker 2>to make the UFO phenomena ridiculous.</v>

3654
01:34:08.741 --> 01:34:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they did that to avoid mass hysteria?</v>

3655
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're the government and you know,</v>

3656
01:34:13.571 --> 01:34:15.870
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing out there but you see these people freaking out,</v>

3657
01:34:15.871 --> 01:34:16.030
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

3658
01:34:16.030 --> 01:34:16.301
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3659
01:34:16.301 --> 01:34:17.134
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3660
01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:17.711
<v Speaker 2>we've looked,</v>

3661
01:34:17.711 --> 01:34:19.810
<v Speaker 2>we've used all of our military might,</v>

3662
01:34:19.811 --> 01:34:22.930
<v Speaker 2>all of our scientific power and we don't see shit,</v>

3663
01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:23.771
<v Speaker 2>I'm not buying this,</v>

3664
01:34:23.771 --> 01:34:24.880
<v Speaker 2>but these people are freaking out.</v>

3665
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:27.910
<v Speaker 2>This has the real potential to get out of hand and go sideways on us.</v>

3666
01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Let's just start making fun of this.</v>

3667
01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3668
01:34:30.130 --> 01:34:30.701
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3669
01:34:30.701 --> 01:34:31.534
<v Speaker 2>Cause uh,</v>

3670
01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.930
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more likely that there's something there that they feel powerless</v>

3671
01:34:34.931 --> 01:34:35.764
<v Speaker 2>to control.</v>

3672
01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:39.910
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Kennedy was taken down into the basement of whatever and shown the</v>

3673
01:34:39.911 --> 01:34:44.911
<v Speaker 2>alien sitting there is what I say about aliens with in regards to Trump.</v>

3674
01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:46.031
<v Speaker 2>If this,</v>

3675
01:34:46.031 --> 01:34:48.360
<v Speaker 2>anybody that would fucking tell us it's him,</v>

3676
01:34:48.361 --> 01:34:48.970
<v Speaker 2>I'll tweet it,</v>

3677
01:34:48.970 --> 01:34:49.331
<v Speaker 2>tweet it,</v>

3678
01:34:49.331 --> 01:34:49.811
<v Speaker 2>immediately,</v>

3679
01:34:49.811 --> 01:34:50.644
<v Speaker 2>tweet it,</v>

3680
01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:51.993
<v Speaker 2>tweet it.</v>

3681
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.860
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] are real.</v>

3682
01:34:53.861 --> 01:34:55.360
<v Speaker 2>But CNN is fake.</v>

3683
01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.353
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3684
01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.193
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3685
01:34:58.650 --> 01:34:59.483
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3686
01:34:59.810 --> 01:35:00.643
<v Speaker 3>It's still,</v>

3687
01:35:00.690 --> 01:35:04.890
<v Speaker 3>he is the failing New York Times sales defined Ufo</v>

3688
01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:11.300
<v Speaker 3>at area 51 if the government does have the evidence they are never going to show</v>

3689
01:35:11.301 --> 01:35:12.134
<v Speaker 3>it to Trump.</v>

3690
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:13.130
<v Speaker 3>That's the problem.</v>

3691
01:35:13.131 --> 01:35:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck's the point being president if you can't find it,</v>

3692
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:20.770
<v Speaker 3>if I knew that to become president meant you get all the access to Ufos,</v>

3693
01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:21.613
<v Speaker 3>I might go.</v>

3694
01:35:21.730 --> 01:35:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3695
01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:22.790
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3696
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:23.623
<v Speaker 3>That's all very good.</v>

3697
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:24.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to try for that.</v>

3698
01:35:24.591 --> 01:35:26.270
<v Speaker 3>The presidents who have tried haven't gotten there.</v>

3699
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:26.571
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3700
01:35:26.571 --> 01:35:27.320
<v Speaker 3>no one gets it.</v>

3701
01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:28.100
<v Speaker 3>Like Jimmy Carter.</v>

3702
01:35:28.100 --> 01:35:29.400
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Carter said he was,</v>

3703
01:35:29.401 --> 01:35:29.960
<v Speaker 3>he he's,</v>

3704
01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:31.190
<v Speaker 3>he had a Ufo experience.</v>

3705
01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:31.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3706
01:35:31.371 --> 01:35:32.204
<v Speaker 3>He saw something.</v>

3707
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:37.220
<v Speaker 3>He said he saw something but see that was back in the 70s where everybody was</v>

3708
01:35:37.221 --> 01:35:38.054
<v Speaker 3>seeing shit.</v>

3709
01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:39.830
<v Speaker 3>They were all talking about things.</v>

3710
01:35:39.831 --> 01:35:43.700
<v Speaker 3>It was part of the zeitgeists people were legit like after close encounters of</v>

3711
01:35:43.701 --> 01:35:44.370
<v Speaker 3>the third kind,</v>

3712
01:35:44.370 --> 01:35:47.990
<v Speaker 3>especially people who are legitimately thinking that aliens were going to come.</v>

3713
01:35:48.330 --> 01:35:48.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3714
01:35:48.630 --> 01:35:53.510
<v Speaker 2>He proposed such a possible scenario and that movie was so good.</v>

3715
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:56.570
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't anything you expected it was going to be.</v>

3716
01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:57.620
<v Speaker 2>But like here I was going to say,</v>

3717
01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.950
<v Speaker 2>here's like another example is like the Rendlesham like that explanation of the</v>

3718
01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:02.480
<v Speaker 2>sixteens locked,</v>

3719
01:36:02.750 --> 01:36:03.583
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3720
01:36:03.650 --> 01:36:04.483
<v Speaker 2>footage,</v>

3721
01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3722
01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.560
<v Speaker 2>like Rendlesham forest where the,</v>

3723
01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:11.810
<v Speaker 2>they claimed that these American soldiers in the woods,</v>

3724
01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:12.673
<v Speaker 2>out in England,</v>

3725
01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:14.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3726
01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:16.190
<v Speaker 2>mistook the light,</v>

3727
01:36:16.191 --> 01:36:21.191
<v Speaker 2>a light house light for a spacecraft that they were within 20 feet of a craft</v>

3728
01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:26.210
<v Speaker 2>that they saw and took notes on different lines of yeah.</v>

3729
01:36:26.211 --> 01:36:26.750
<v Speaker 2>They walk,</v>

3730
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:28.250
<v Speaker 2>not even like right up against it.</v>

3731
01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:30.570
<v Speaker 2>And they wrote down notes,</v>

3732
01:36:30.571 --> 01:36:34.020
<v Speaker 2>saw like different sort of hieroglyphs on the ship itself described it's</v>

3733
01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:34.930
<v Speaker 2>described the,</v>

3734
01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:35.810
<v Speaker 2>the feel of it,</v>

3735
01:36:35.811 --> 01:36:37.820
<v Speaker 2>this electrostatic feel of being around it.</v>

3736
01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And the official explanation was they missed,</v>

3737
01:36:41.491 --> 01:36:46.220
<v Speaker 2>took a lighthouse several miles away for this spacecraft.</v>

3738
01:36:46.730 --> 01:36:48.530
<v Speaker 2>So outcomes razor against us.</v>

3739
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:53.450
<v Speaker 2>That's hard to believe that these trained observers and that's the other thing.</v>

3740
01:36:53.451 --> 01:36:56.060
<v Speaker 2>They always tried to dismiss the idea that trained observers are better</v>

3741
01:36:56.061 --> 01:36:56.894
<v Speaker 2>observers.</v>

3742
01:36:57.330 --> 01:36:58.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3743
01:36:58.100 --> 01:36:59.720
<v Speaker 2>but they are better observers.</v>

3744
01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

3745
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:01.730
<v Speaker 2>In the age of,</v>

3746
01:37:01.730 --> 01:37:02.150
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3747
01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Today where everyone has a high definition camera in their pocket.</v>

3748
01:37:06.741 --> 01:37:07.370
<v Speaker 2>Have you taken,</v>

3749
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:10.010
<v Speaker 2>have you taken a photograph of the moon on your,</v>

3750
01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:10.873
<v Speaker 2>on your phones?</v>

3751
01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:12.320
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't look like the moon.</v>

3752
01:37:12.350 --> 01:37:12.880
<v Speaker 2>What's true,</v>

3753
01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:13.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3754
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:14.300
<v Speaker 2>There's no details.</v>

3755
01:37:14.410 --> 01:37:15.740
<v Speaker 2>It comes out of the lung.</v>

3756
01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:17.090
<v Speaker 2>The lenses are too wide,</v>

3757
01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:18.260
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

3758
01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:19.430
<v Speaker 2>but I'll comes.</v>

3759
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:20.211
<v Speaker 2>Razors has all right,</v>

3760
01:37:20.211 --> 01:37:22.610
<v Speaker 2>they saw something but they,</v>

3761
01:37:22.710 --> 01:37:23.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3762
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:26.690
<v Speaker 2>cause what is the likelihood that trained observers who have been on this base</v>

3763
01:37:26.691 --> 01:37:31.310
<v Speaker 2>for years on this night would mistake a lighthouse that they've seen every night</v>

3764
01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:34.100
<v Speaker 2>for the entire time they've been on this base for a Ufo?</v>

3765
01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:36.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3766
01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:39.320
<v Speaker 2>what is the likelihood that that explanation is correct?</v>

3767
01:37:39.350 --> 01:37:40.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of that store.</v>

3768
01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:40.911
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3769
01:37:40.911 --> 01:37:41.744
<v Speaker 2>Rendlesham forest.</v>

3770
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:42.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3771
01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:42.560
<v Speaker 2>How'd he say it?</v>

3772
01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Bent Woods or incurring some Rendlesham and r.</v>

3773
01:37:46.461 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>E.</v>

3774
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>N.</v>

3775
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>D.</v>

3776
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>L.</v>

3777
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>E.</v>

3778
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>S.</v>

3779
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>H.</v>

3780
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>

3781
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.450
<v Speaker 2>M.</v>

3782
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Rendlesham forest was bandwidths.</v>

3783
01:37:51.501 --> 01:37:53.720
<v Speaker 2>It was two nights to get character actor on Colombo.</v>

3784
01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Where are you up?</v>

3785
01:37:54.460 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Where and</v>

3786
01:37:56.060 --> 01:37:56.370
<v Speaker 3>it was a,</v>

3787
01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:57.990
<v Speaker 3>and it's a nuclear installations.</v>

3788
01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:02.550
<v Speaker 3>Rendlesham forest and nuclear installations are always ripe with Ufo stories.</v>

3789
01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:03.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3790
01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:05.033
<v Speaker 3>What year was this?</v>

3791
01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:05.611
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3792
01:38:05.611 --> 01:38:06.460
<v Speaker 3>this was in the 80s.</v>

3793
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:07.260
<v Speaker 3>80?</v>

3794
01:38:07.260 --> 01:38:07.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3795
01:38:07.710 --> 01:38:08.520
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>

3796
01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:09.353
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>

3797
01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.000
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>

3798
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:10.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3799
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.920
<v Speaker 3>and it said,</v>

3800
01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.540
<v Speaker 3>obviously the obvious explanation is not the explanation.</v>

3801
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:16.260
<v Speaker 3>The only thing you can accept is that these observers saw something.</v>

3802
01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:17.820
<v Speaker 3>You described it accurately.</v>

3803
01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Is it something that had crashed,</v>

3804
01:38:19.411 --> 01:38:20.280
<v Speaker 3>if you want to say that?</v>

3805
01:38:20.281 --> 01:38:20.490
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3806
01:38:20.490 --> 01:38:21.510
<v Speaker 3>it came down was,</v>

3807
01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:22.613
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

3808
01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:23.071
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3809
01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:24.790
<v Speaker 3>landed in the forest and,</v>

3810
01:38:25.090 --> 01:38:25.923
<v Speaker 3>and took off.</v>

3811
01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.290
<v Speaker 3>What do you think of the rotten king case the night before that?</v>

3812
01:38:28.291 --> 01:38:28.651
<v Speaker 3>Roswell.</v>

3813
01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:29.450
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3814
01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:30.840
<v Speaker 3>I think it's probably true.</v>

3815
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:31.580
<v Speaker 3>Real.</v>

3816
01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:32.610
<v Speaker 3>You're all in?</v>

3817
01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.000
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3818
01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:33.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3819
01:38:33.210 --> 01:38:34.043
<v Speaker 3>David,</v>

3820
01:38:34.130 --> 01:38:34.660
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3821
01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:35.640
<v Speaker 3>because the interesting,</v>

3822
01:38:35.650 --> 01:38:36.091
<v Speaker 3>but again,</v>

3823
01:38:36.091 --> 01:38:36.660
<v Speaker 3>because the,</v>

3824
01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.250
<v Speaker 3>because the cover stories for our,</v>

3825
01:38:38.251 --> 01:38:41.070
<v Speaker 3>so much less believable then an alien.</v>

3826
01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:41.401
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3827
01:38:41.401 --> 01:38:42.420
<v Speaker 3>I used to have a joke about it.</v>

3828
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:43.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3829
01:38:43.100 --> 01:38:47.610
<v Speaker 3>They put it on the paper that they have recovered a crashed Ufo and alien bodies</v>

3830
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:48.780
<v Speaker 3>and the next day set up,</v>

3831
01:38:48.781 --> 01:38:49.381
<v Speaker 3>we made a mistake.</v>

3832
01:38:49.381 --> 01:38:50.214
<v Speaker 3>It was just a balloon.</v>

3833
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.903
<v Speaker 3>What about,</v>

3834
01:38:52.830 --> 01:38:53.760
<v Speaker 3>what about the aliens?</v>

3835
01:38:56.010 --> 01:38:56.880
<v Speaker 3>They're Mexicans.</v>

3836
01:38:56.881 --> 01:38:57.714
<v Speaker 3>They were drinking,</v>

3837
01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.030
<v Speaker 3>apparently they thought the balloons up,</v>

3838
01:38:59.120 --> 01:38:59.953
<v Speaker 3>Yada.</v>

3839
01:39:00.570 --> 01:39:01.590
<v Speaker 3>He got a little crazy.</v>

3840
01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:04.320
<v Speaker 3>We just invented some new stuff.</v>

3841
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3842
01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Out of nowhere.</v>

3843
01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:06.390
<v Speaker 3>And then 30 years later they go,</v>

3844
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:06.780
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3845
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:07.260
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

3846
01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:10.830
<v Speaker 3>they were high altitude a dummies that we were dropping.</v>

3847
01:39:10.890 --> 01:39:11.341
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

3848
01:39:11.341 --> 01:39:13.320
<v Speaker 3>To test how they would fall.</v>

3849
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.720
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

3850
01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:15.900
<v Speaker 3>we have lasers and visibility cloaks.</v>

3851
01:39:16.020 --> 01:39:16.451
<v Speaker 3>Well the,</v>

3852
01:39:16.451 --> 01:39:20.700
<v Speaker 3>they showed up again the next day with a bunch of weather balloons.</v>

3853
01:39:20.701 --> 01:39:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Scraps.</v>

3854
01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:21.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3855
01:39:21.610 --> 01:39:22.171
<v Speaker 3>Like look,</v>

3856
01:39:22.171 --> 01:39:22.670
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

3857
01:39:22.670 --> 01:39:22.890
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3858
01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:23.760
<v Speaker 3>What the guy holding it up.</v>

3859
01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:27.570
<v Speaker 3>Like what they don't tell you is that they flew the wreckage out to Wright</v>

3860
01:39:27.570 --> 01:39:30.510
<v Speaker 3>Patterson air force in two separate planes and the Truman met them there.</v>

3861
01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.433
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3862
01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:32.060
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3863
01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:32.340
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3864
01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:33.173
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

3865
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.020
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3866
01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:37.140
<v Speaker 3>the more rational separate planes the morning because they were worried that one</v>

3867
01:39:37.141 --> 01:39:39.150
<v Speaker 3>would crash the weather,</v>

3868
01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.140
<v Speaker 3>the weather balloon thing is not as rational as something weird happened.</v>

3869
01:39:43.230 --> 01:39:43.711
<v Speaker 3>I listened to,</v>

3870
01:39:43.711 --> 01:39:48.060
<v Speaker 3>I want it to be alien so bad I questioned myself.</v>

3871
01:39:48.180 --> 01:39:49.230
<v Speaker 3>So that's my problem.</v>

3872
01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:50.520
<v Speaker 3>I want to do that stuff.</v>

3873
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:51.181
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

3874
01:39:51.181 --> 01:39:51.570
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3875
01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:52.980
<v Speaker 3>I won't like,</v>

3876
01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:56.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll be skeptical about stuff that just seems crazy or people that you know,</v>

3877
01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:57.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3878
01:39:57.120 --> 01:40:00.000
<v Speaker 3>sort of ascribe some sort of metaphysical explanation for all this.</v>

3879
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.780
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3880
01:40:00.780 --> 01:40:01.230
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

3881
01:40:01.230 --> 01:40:02.700
<v Speaker 3>my thing is just,</v>

3882
01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:06.360
<v Speaker 3>well if the preponderance of the evidence says something happened but doesn't</v>

3883
01:40:06.361 --> 01:40:07.380
<v Speaker 3>tell you what happened,</v>

3884
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.690
<v Speaker 3>then you still have to believe something happened.</v>

3885
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:13.590
<v Speaker 3>Not knowing what happened isn't evidence that it didn't happen and yet you're</v>

3886
01:40:13.591 --> 01:40:15.510
<v Speaker 3>still a flat earthers yeah.</v>

3887
01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:17.730
<v Speaker 3>Have you looked outside?</v>

3888
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:20.010
<v Speaker 3>It's seems flat.</v>

3889
01:40:20.020 --> 01:40:20.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3890
01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Have you studied Hashtag faith spaces fake?</v>

3891
01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:24.601
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3892
01:40:24.601 --> 01:40:25.070
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3893
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Just lived into people dumber.</v>

3894
01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:30.450
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are so dumb.</v>

3895
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.850
<v Speaker 3>You think the earth is flat and this people that,</v>

3896
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.020
<v Speaker 3>that are so dumb,</v>

3897
01:40:34.021 --> 01:40:37.440
<v Speaker 3>they make fun of the people that are dumber than them.</v>

3898
01:40:37.740 --> 01:40:38.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3899
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3900
01:40:38.850 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 3>They think that that space is fake spaces fake.</v>

3901
01:40:41.790 --> 01:40:42.623
<v Speaker 3>There's no space,</v>

3902
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.033
<v Speaker 3>no space.</v>

3903
01:40:44.130 --> 01:40:44.963
<v Speaker 3>And it's basically,</v>

3904

<v Speaker 3>well that's the holographic theory.</v>

3959
01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:09.710
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3960
01:42:09.710 --> 01:42:10.543
<v Speaker 4>a flat earth there.</v>

3961
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.831
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3962
01:42:11.831 --> 01:42:12.640
<v Speaker 4>he was.</v>

3963
01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:15.130
<v Speaker 4>And he was a computer programmer.</v>

3964
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:16.180
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3965

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3966
01:42:16.930 --> 01:42:20.880

3967
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:23.920
<v Speaker 4>Not Working at NASA the whole time while he,</v>

3968
01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:25.840
<v Speaker 4>while he drove me crazy,</v>

3969
01:42:26.380 --> 01:42:27.213
<v Speaker 4>he drove me.</v>

3970
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:28.270
<v Speaker 4>He knew what he was doing it.</v>

3971
01:42:28.271 --> 01:42:29.560
<v Speaker 4>I think it's doing it on purpose.</v>

3972
01:42:29.561 --> 01:42:29.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3973

01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.271

01:42:31.271 --> 01:42:33.670
<v Speaker 4>So I bet you're one of those guys that believes the Earth's round,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3978
01:42:34.781 --> 01:42:37.570

3979
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:38.650
<v Speaker 4>They picked me up at the airport.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3981
01:42:39.370 --> 01:42:39.740

01:42:40.481 --> 01:42:41.440
<v Speaker 4>it's so beautiful.</v>

3984
01:42:41.441 --> 01:42:43.270
<v Speaker 4>The sunset over the curvature of the earth.</v>

3985
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:44.313
<v Speaker 4>That's how it started.</v>

3986
01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:45.953
<v Speaker 4>I think of us went up.</v>

3987
01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:48.370
<v Speaker 4>Not really the curvature of the earth.</v>

3988
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:50.530
<v Speaker 4>That's how it started.</v>

3989
01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.450
<v Speaker 4>And he will not stop.</v>

3990
01:42:52.510 --> 01:42:52.711
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3991
01:42:52.711 --> 01:42:54.790
<v Speaker 4>my point where I was,</v>

3992
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:55.743
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

3993
01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:57.730
<v Speaker 4>I think I tore my clothes off.</v>

3994
01:43:00.850 --> 01:43:02.140
<v Speaker 4>He made me sell insane.</v>

3995
01:43:02.141 --> 01:43:03.580
<v Speaker 4>There's so many of them now and you know,</v>

3996
01:43:03.581 --> 01:43:03.991
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

3997
01:43:03.991 --> 01:43:07.090
<v Speaker 4>we've uncovered the origins of it are what we think the origins of it.</v>

3998
01:43:07.091 --> 01:43:09.070
<v Speaker 4>It was a troll from four Chan,</v>

3999
01:43:09.610 --> 01:43:12.880
<v Speaker 4>four Chan was fucking around and they started promoting this idea that the earth</v>

4000
01:43:12.881 --> 01:43:13.661
<v Speaker 4>is actually the flower.</v>

4001
01:43:13.661 --> 01:43:16.390
<v Speaker 4>It started that a lot of things start from that sense.</v>

4002
01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:19.000
<v Speaker 4>That's where the free bleeding movement started from.</v>

4003
01:43:19.150 --> 01:43:19.931
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that is.</v>

4004
01:43:19.931 --> 01:43:24.370
<v Speaker 4>Women are expressing their power by not controlling their menstrual cycle with</v>

4005
01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:25.630
<v Speaker 4>pads or tampons.</v>

4006
01:43:25.631 --> 01:43:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Just bleeding into their pants to show their power.</v>

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:29.021
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4008
01:43:29.021 --> 01:43:30.700
<v Speaker 4>They did it on four Chan as a joke,</v>

4009
01:43:30.701 --> 01:43:32.080
<v Speaker 4>and the women started doing it in real life.</v>

4010
01:43:32.081 --> 01:43:32.590
<v Speaker 4>For Real.</v>

4011
01:43:32.590 --> 01:43:32.831
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4012
01:43:32.831 --> 01:43:34.120
<v Speaker 4>They thought that thought it was like,</v>

4013
01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:35.410
<v Speaker 4>this is a way to like,</v>

4014
01:43:35.650 --> 01:43:37.450
<v Speaker 4>these people were disgusted by menstrual blood.</v>

4015
01:43:38.210 --> 01:43:39.043
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4016

4020
01:43:48.311 --> 01:43:49.670
<v Speaker 4>It makes me want to start one four.</v>

4021
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:50.650
<v Speaker 4>Chan is the best.</v>

4022
01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:51.111
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>

4023
01:43:51.111 --> 01:43:52.070
<v Speaker 4>they're so good at that.</v>

4024
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:55.760
<v Speaker 4>They're so good at starting these goofy ass fucking little movements and then</v>

4025
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:57.200
<v Speaker 4>getting people behind it.</v>

4026
01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:58.310
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>

4027

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:00.771

4034
01:44:01.521 --> 01:44:03.080
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a bunch of really smart people.</v>

4035
01:44:03.230 --> 01:44:03.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4036
01:44:03.650 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 4>some of them not so smart,</v>

4037
01:44:04.761 --> 01:44:07.430
<v Speaker 4>but some of them really smart that are stuck at their desks and they're bored as</v>

4038
01:44:07.431 --> 01:44:10.290
<v Speaker 4>shit with some computer job somewhere and they think of,</v>

4039
01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:11.331
<v Speaker 4>in the meantime,</v>

4040
01:44:11.331 --> 01:44:12.950
<v Speaker 4>they just decided to fuck with people.</v>

4041
01:44:13.070 --> 01:44:13.903
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4042

<v Speaker 4>the free bleeding movement,</v>

4044
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:24.020
<v Speaker 4>which was also started by four Chan Four Chan started this movement where women</v>

4045
01:44:24.021 --> 01:44:27.200
<v Speaker 4>would express their power by not controlling their menstrual cycle by just</v>

4046
01:44:27.201 --> 01:44:29.270
<v Speaker 4>letting the blood leak out into their pants.</v>

4047
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:34.100
<v Speaker 4>And they did it as a joke that four Chan did and women started actually doing</v>

4048
01:44:34.101 --> 01:44:34.250
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

4049
01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Caught on.</v>

4050
01:44:34.850 --> 01:44:35.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4051
01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.010
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of these things.</v>

4052
01:44:37.250 --> 01:44:38.930
<v Speaker 4>It's so hard to mock,</v>

4053
01:44:39.010 --> 01:44:39.581
<v Speaker 4>but it's so,</v>

4054
01:44:39.581 --> 01:44:43.220
<v Speaker 4>so hard to figure out like what is mockery and what's real.</v>

4055
01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:43.761
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4056
01:44:43.761 --> 01:44:45.260
<v Speaker 4>What is parody and what's,</v>

4057
01:44:45.330 --> 01:44:46.163
<v Speaker 4>what's,</v>

4058
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:47.263
<v Speaker 4>what's the onion?</v>

4059
01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:48.440
<v Speaker 4>The onion is,</v>

4060
01:44:48.650 --> 01:44:49.483
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4061
01:44:49.940 --> 01:44:50.680
<v Speaker 4>have you,</v>

4062
01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.940
<v Speaker 4>do you know that James Lindsey,</v>

4063
01:44:53.150 --> 01:44:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Peter Boghossian was how the woman's name,</v>

4064
01:44:55.131 --> 01:44:58.280
<v Speaker 4>the one one that we didn't meet the grievance studies hoaxes.</v>

4065
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:59.383
<v Speaker 4>Do you know</v>

4066
01:45:01.670 --> 01:45:05.810
<v Speaker 4>Peter but goes in as a professor at University of Portland and um,</v>

4067
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:07.940
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the school he's in Portland.</v>

4068
01:45:08.230 --> 01:45:08.960
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4069
01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:10.580
<v Speaker 4>and he decided to,</v>

4070
01:45:10.581 --> 01:45:11.930
<v Speaker 4>with these other academics,</v>

4071
01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.110
<v Speaker 4>publish these fake papers on like,</v>

4072
01:45:15.111 --> 01:45:15.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4073
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:16.743
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4074
01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:18.890
<v Speaker 4>rape and dog parks and like,</v>

4075
01:45:18.891 --> 01:45:19.340
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4076
01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:20.060
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4077
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:20.420
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4078
01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:21.253
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4079
01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:22.940
<v Speaker 4>cis normative,</v>

4080
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:24.800
<v Speaker 4>like different,</v>

4081
01:45:24.801 --> 01:45:26.030
<v Speaker 4>like [inaudible] what happened?</v>

4082
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:27.440
<v Speaker 4>No people loved them.</v>

4083
01:45:28.130 --> 01:45:30.720
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous things like fat bodybuilding,</v>

4084
01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:31.880
<v Speaker 4>like bodybuilding contest,</v>

4085
01:45:31.881 --> 01:45:32.870
<v Speaker 4>a contest for fat.</v>

4086
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:36.770
<v Speaker 4>People like to talk about the impairment with the importance of these things,</v>

4087
01:45:36.771 --> 01:45:40.850
<v Speaker 4>like things that you would read and you would think would be obviously a parody.</v>

4088
01:45:40.851 --> 01:45:41.684
<v Speaker 4>Someone's fucking around.</v>

4089
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.801
<v Speaker 4>They submit these,</v>

4090
01:45:42.801 --> 01:45:44.930
<v Speaker 4>these academic journals not only get published,</v>

4091
01:45:44.931 --> 01:45:46.580
<v Speaker 4>but they get praised for,</v>

4092
01:45:46.610 --> 01:45:47.960
<v Speaker 4>for their scholarship,</v>

4093
01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:49.970
<v Speaker 4>and then they came out and said,</v>

4094
01:45:49.971 --> 01:45:50.091
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

4095
01:45:50.091 --> 01:45:51.110
<v Speaker 4>we were fucking with you guys.</v>

4096
01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:51.944
<v Speaker 4>This is all Joe.</v>

4097
01:45:52.170 --> 01:45:52.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4098
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:53.780
<v Speaker 4>It's out there and you know,</v>

4099
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:55.310
<v Speaker 4>you guys love these papers,</v>

4100
01:45:55.311 --> 01:45:56.144
<v Speaker 4>you morons,</v>

4101
01:45:56.150 --> 01:45:57.700
<v Speaker 4>and that this is problem.</v>

4102
01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:02.740
<v Speaker 4>Part of the problem with the humanities today is that things are so sideways in</v>

4103
01:46:02.871 --> 01:46:03.531
<v Speaker 4>terms of like,</v>

4104
01:46:03.531 --> 01:46:04.850
<v Speaker 4>it's so difficult to find out what's,</v>

4105
01:46:05.210 --> 01:46:07.010
<v Speaker 4>what's parody and what's reality.</v>

4106
01:46:07.130 --> 01:46:07.963
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4107
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:10.183
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

4108
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.580
<v Speaker 4>It's an insane time is insane as it gets.</v>

4109
01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4110
01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:15.043
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4111
01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:15.381
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4112
01:46:15.381 --> 01:46:15.831
<v Speaker 4>Then it gets,</v>

4113
01:46:15.831 --> 01:46:17.000
<v Speaker 4>it says very unsettling.</v>

4114
01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:20.930
<v Speaker 4>It's fine to not know if someone's having me on or not.</v>

4115
01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:21.810
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4116
01:46:21.810 --> 01:46:22.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4117
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4118
01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:23.420
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

4119
01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:28.540
<v Speaker 4>all the structures that used that for good or for bad would filter things down</v>

4120
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:30.283
<v Speaker 4>are gone.</v>

4121
01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:31.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4122
01:46:31.130 --> 01:46:31.461
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4123
01:46:31.461 --> 01:46:31.881
<v Speaker 4>like we,</v>

4124
01:46:31.881 --> 01:46:32.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4125
01:46:32.151 --> 01:46:35.930
<v Speaker 4>everything was handed over to powerful people who filtered what we were given to</v>

4126
01:46:35.931 --> 01:46:36.764
<v Speaker 4>know.</v>

4127
01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:37.581
<v Speaker 4>There used to be,</v>

4128
01:46:37.581 --> 01:46:37.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4129
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:41.570
<v Speaker 4>an agreement of common sense that used to hang around.</v>

4130
01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.950
<v Speaker 4>I think the cure is fine reading and I think we're going to accept that cure</v>

4131
01:46:46.130 --> 01:46:46.460
<v Speaker 4>because I,</v>

4132
01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:46.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4133
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 4>Ilan is working on some sort of neural link things.</v>

4134
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:51.870
<v Speaker 3>The only way we'll know if someone's telling them the truth.</v>

4135
01:46:52.710 --> 01:46:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good.</v>

4136
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.280
<v Speaker 3>We're going to accept it and we're going to give in and we're gonna we're,</v>

4137
01:46:56.281 --> 01:46:57.540
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be able to,</v>

4138
01:46:57.740 --> 01:46:59.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll take it another step further.</v>

4139
01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.320
<v Speaker 3>I think they're going to create a universal language.</v>

4140
01:47:01.321 --> 01:47:02.430
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking about this a lot.</v>

4141
01:47:02.670 --> 01:47:06.600
<v Speaker 3>I think there's going to be a universal language that probably is a augmented</v>

4142
01:47:06.601 --> 01:47:07.081
<v Speaker 3>reality,</v>

4143
01:47:07.081 --> 01:47:12.081
<v Speaker 3>some augmented reality language shapes or some kind of symbolism that is</v>

4144
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:16.650
<v Speaker 3>something that we agreed to and we're probably not going to accept it because</v>

4145
01:47:16.651 --> 01:47:17.131
<v Speaker 3>we're old.</v>

4146
01:47:17.131 --> 01:47:17.401
<v Speaker 3>We're like,</v>

4147
01:47:17.401 --> 01:47:18.570
<v Speaker 3>fuck this next generation.</v>

4148
01:47:18.571 --> 01:47:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Our kids,</v>

4149
01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:20.280
<v Speaker 3>maybe even our kids,</v>

4150
01:47:20.281 --> 01:47:20.971
<v Speaker 3>kids are kids.</v>

4151
01:47:20.971 --> 01:47:23.310
<v Speaker 3>Kids are going to be the first people to adopt it and then it's going to be</v>

4152
01:47:23.311 --> 01:47:28.311
<v Speaker 3>universal worldwide and with augmented reality and some sort of ability to</v>

4153
01:47:29.911 --> 01:47:33.240
<v Speaker 3>interact with each other through kind of bandwidth.</v>

4154
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I remember the first time I heard about cochlear implants as the first thing</v>

4155
01:47:36.901 --> 01:47:37.621
<v Speaker 3>that popped in my head is,</v>

4156
01:47:37.621 --> 01:47:38.520
<v Speaker 3>this is the start.</v>

4157
01:47:38.660 --> 01:47:38.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4158
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:42.240
<v Speaker 3>This is the interface now officially a,</v>

4159
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:43.123
<v Speaker 3>you're a sidebar.</v>

4160
01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.311
<v Speaker 3>Cochlear implant.</v>

4161
01:47:44.311 --> 01:47:45.140
<v Speaker 3>You are a Cyborg.</v>

4162
01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

4163
01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:46.290
<v Speaker 3>he's a $600 one.</v>

4164
01:47:46.291 --> 01:47:47.700
<v Speaker 3>People with apple watches on,</v>

4165
01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:48.400
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4166
01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:49.530
<v Speaker 3>You're wearing an apple watch.</v>

4167
01:47:49.531 --> 01:47:50.011
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you,</v>

4168
01:47:50.011 --> 01:47:50.341
<v Speaker 3>what do you,</v>

4169
01:47:50.341 --> 01:47:50.761
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

4170
01:47:50.761 --> 01:47:53.610
<v Speaker 3>You have a computer that's constantly strapped to you all the time,</v>

4171
01:47:53.630 --> 01:47:55.470
<v Speaker 3>is you monitoring your heart rate,</v>

4172
01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

4173
01:47:56.041 --> 01:47:58.110
<v Speaker 3>and then we've been sitting here and,</v>

4174
01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:58.973
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4175
01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:00.000
<v Speaker 3>when we don't know something,</v>

4176
01:48:00.001 --> 01:48:03.030
<v Speaker 3>accessing the entire store of human knowledge,</v>

4177
01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.150
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's our sidebar,</v>

4178
01:48:05.070 --> 01:48:07.530
<v Speaker 3>we're accessing all of human knowledge in an instant.</v>

4179
01:48:07.531 --> 01:48:07.980
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

4180
01:48:07.980 --> 01:48:08.813
<v Speaker 3>Anytime we will not.</v>

4181
01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:11.400
<v Speaker 3>That was Elan's other thing that he said on the podcast.</v>

4182
01:48:11.401 --> 01:48:12.360
<v Speaker 3>You're already a Cyborg.</v>

4183
01:48:12.361 --> 01:48:13.050
<v Speaker 3>You have a phone.</v>

4184
01:48:13.050 --> 01:48:13.381
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>

4185
01:48:13.381 --> 01:48:14.520
<v Speaker 3>it's not in your body,</v>

4186
01:48:14.521 --> 01:48:15.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's something you're holding onto.</v>

4187
01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:16.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4188
01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:17.520
<v Speaker 3>It's calming.</v>

4189
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:18.690
<v Speaker 3>It's voluntary cyborg.</v>

4190
01:48:18.691 --> 01:48:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Did you guys read the third wave years ago?</v>

4191
01:48:20.370 --> 01:48:21.170
<v Speaker 3>Was that a book here?</v>

4192
01:48:21.170 --> 01:48:24.060
<v Speaker 3>I forgot it now know that was the protection of all this.</v>

4193
01:48:24.480 --> 01:48:24.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4194
01:48:24.721 --> 01:48:29.721
<v Speaker 3>and the early eighties and it was a prediction and the one thing a third way</v>

4195
01:48:31.321 --> 01:48:33.480
<v Speaker 3>predicted was that the next generation,</v>

4196
01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:35.190
<v Speaker 3>the first line in it,</v>

4197
01:48:35.191 --> 01:48:35.901
<v Speaker 3>I remember it was at,</v>

4198
01:48:35.901 --> 01:48:36.960
<v Speaker 3>it's all about information.</v>

4199
01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4200
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:39.540
<v Speaker 3>It's all going to be about sharing information.</v>

4201
01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:42.090
<v Speaker 3>You know that someone's going to figure out a way to share information.</v>

4202
01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:42.241
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4203
01:48:42.241 --> 01:48:44.040
<v Speaker 3>that's when I saw the cochlear implant.</v>

4204
01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:44.641
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

4205
01:48:44.641 --> 01:48:44.821
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4206
01:48:44.821 --> 01:48:45.960
<v Speaker 3>if you're all right,</v>

4207
01:48:45.961 --> 01:48:46.794
<v Speaker 3>so your,</v>

4208
01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:51.510
<v Speaker 3>your brain is interpreting an electronic signal as information directly.</v>

4209
01:48:51.540 --> 01:48:53.460
<v Speaker 3>It's bypassing the ear entirely.</v>

4210
01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:54.150
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

4211
01:48:54.150 --> 01:48:57.180
<v Speaker 3>and it's just a neuronal connection and does that will,</v>

4212
01:48:57.270 --> 01:49:00.660
<v Speaker 3>that eventually is how we will access the Internet,</v>

4213
01:49:00.661 --> 01:49:03.090
<v Speaker 3>will access the Internet as though it is our own thoughts.</v>

4214
01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:06.120
<v Speaker 3>It will be as easily as I remember your name.</v>

4215
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:09.930
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember any other fact that is on record the matrix and we'll all be</v>

4216
01:49:09.931 --> 01:49:11.130
<v Speaker 3>part of the same.</v>

4217
01:49:11.250 --> 01:49:11.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4218
01:49:11.431 --> 01:49:11.731
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

4219
01:49:11.731 --> 01:49:13.080
<v Speaker 3>We won't be sitting in pods somewhere.</v>

4220
01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:14.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4221
01:49:14.020 --> 01:49:17.040
<v Speaker 3>I think it speak for yourself and initially will be like a peripheral thing.</v>

4222
01:49:17.041 --> 01:49:19.860
<v Speaker 3>You'd be able to tap into it or not as you as you wish,</v>

4223
01:49:20.100 --> 01:49:21.930
<v Speaker 3>but I think as time goes on,</v>

4224
01:49:21.931 --> 01:49:23.490
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be more and more integrated.</v>

4225
01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.380
<v Speaker 3>Just like distinguished it from your own mind.</v>

4226
01:49:25.381 --> 01:49:29.250
<v Speaker 3>Like you used to have to go to a computer that was hardwired into the wall and</v>

4227
01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:31.380
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to dial up to get online.</v>

4228
01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:31.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4229
01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:33.420
<v Speaker 3>Now everything's instantaneous.</v>

4230
01:49:33.421 --> 01:49:34.141
<v Speaker 3>This in your phone,</v>

4231
01:49:34.141 --> 01:49:35.060
<v Speaker 3>and this isn't me.</v>

4232
01:49:35.130 --> 01:49:36.990
<v Speaker 3>I remember when we were on news radio,</v>

4233
01:49:37.020 --> 01:49:41.370
<v Speaker 3>I first got an apple computer and got online and I was fucking fascinated.</v>

4234
01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:42.600
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't believe,</v>

4235
01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:43.660
<v Speaker 3>and the two comp you serve,</v>

4236
01:49:43.670 --> 01:49:45.330
<v Speaker 3>this is how we got to bring it all around.</v>

4237
01:49:45.510 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 3>The first thing I did was download reports,</v>

4238
01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:49.840
<v Speaker 4>downloading Ufo,</v>

4239
01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:50.770
<v Speaker 4>like a Dork,</v>

4240
01:49:50.771 --> 01:49:52.000
<v Speaker 4>like learning all these things.</v>

4241
01:49:52.001 --> 01:49:52.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4242
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:57.270
<v Speaker 4>Well I remember the first chat with somebody I remember in 1993 and it was 95</v>

4243
01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:59.111
<v Speaker 4>office computer.</v>

4244
01:49:59.111 --> 01:50:02.260
<v Speaker 4>First Time I had an Newsradio was the first time I had an email account.</v>

4245
01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:03.401
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

4246
01:50:03.401 --> 01:50:04.480
<v Speaker 4>And getting on online.</v>

4247
01:50:04.570 --> 01:50:05.880
<v Speaker 4>I know and I mean,</v>

4248
01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:06.041
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4249
01:50:06.041 --> 01:50:08.590
<v Speaker 4>at first I think I went to the Lubes site sure.</v>

4250
01:50:08.591 --> 01:50:10.480
<v Speaker 4>To see what was on there and you know,</v>

4251
01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:15.100
<v Speaker 4>watch Hieronymus Bosch painting download in about 30 minutes</v>

4252
01:50:16.690 --> 01:50:17.290
<v Speaker 4>and then that was,</v>

4253
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:17.571
<v Speaker 4>I was going,</v>

4254
01:50:17.571 --> 01:50:17.991
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

4255
01:50:17.991 --> 01:50:19.830
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm at the Lou.</v>

4256
01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:23.800
<v Speaker 4>Why remember you had a program on your laptop,</v>

4257
01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:28.860
<v Speaker 4>this was like 96 you had a program on your laptop that kept crashing,</v>

4258
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:33.210
<v Speaker 4>but when it worked it was amazing because we give you the news as a screen</v>

4259
01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:34.053
<v Speaker 4>saver,</v>

4260
01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:35.800
<v Speaker 4>as a screen saver.</v>

4261
01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:40.820
<v Speaker 4>The news would just come up constantly in a constant flow of news edge with</v>

4262
01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:43.270
<v Speaker 4>technologies and I wish that still existed.</v>

4263
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:44.170
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist anymore.</v>

4264
01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think it was Wifi.</v>

4265
01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:48.460
<v Speaker 4>I think you owe me again my head,</v>

4266
01:50:48.461 --> 01:50:50.680
<v Speaker 4>an ISD n line in my house,</v>

4267
01:50:51.190 --> 01:50:56.190
<v Speaker 4>I remember which gave me 128 kilobits per second years ahead of everybody I knew</v>

4268
01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.300
<v Speaker 4>I had a t one line installed in my house.</v>

4269
01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:03.690
<v Speaker 4>I remember it like it was like I need those.</v>

4270
01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:04.060
<v Speaker 4>The only,</v>

4271
01:51:04.060 --> 01:51:05.290
<v Speaker 4>I lived in the woods.</v>

4272
01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:09.010
<v Speaker 4>It was the only way I could get like really high speed Internet access had carve</v>

4273
01:51:09.011 --> 01:51:11.290
<v Speaker 4>a fucking hole in the ground and give me a business pipe.</v>

4274
01:51:11.340 --> 01:51:11.770
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

4275
01:51:11.770 --> 01:51:13.420
<v Speaker 4>Now five g's around the corner,</v>

4276
01:51:13.421 --> 01:51:14.254
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

4277
01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:16.480
<v Speaker 4>five t's facet.</v>

4278
01:51:16.481 --> 01:51:19.290
<v Speaker 4>If they say it's going to be hundreds of times faster than everything.</v>

4279
01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:20.133
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

4280
01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:21.240
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4281
01:51:21.300 --> 01:51:21.620
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4282
01:51:21.620 --> 01:51:23.090
<v Speaker 4>it's like to a,</v>

4283
01:51:23.130 --> 01:51:24.760
<v Speaker 4>to a fiber optic link.</v>

4284
01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:25.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4285
01:51:25.300 --> 01:51:25.860
<v Speaker 4>On your phone.</v>

4286
01:51:25.860 --> 01:51:26.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4287
01:51:26.290 --> 01:51:30.010
<v Speaker 4>I think cds or those are gone now forever not saved just in case.</v>

4288
01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:31.553
<v Speaker 4>Just to shit.</v>

4289
01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:31.871
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4290
01:51:31.871 --> 01:51:35.200
<v Speaker 4>the real question is like where are we storing all this stuff if we're only</v>

4291
01:51:35.201 --> 01:51:38.390
<v Speaker 4>storing it in one zero was like we were talking about the demise of civilization</v>

4292
01:51:38.391 --> 01:51:39.340
<v Speaker 4>and they pass that up.</v>

4293
01:51:39.341 --> 01:51:39.790
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4294
01:51:39.790 --> 01:51:40.623
<v Speaker 4>But that's what,</v>

4295
01:51:40.630 --> 01:51:42.220
<v Speaker 4>that's what probably,</v>

4296
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:43.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4297
01:51:43.091 --> 01:51:44.350
<v Speaker 4>every society probably,</v>

4298
01:51:44.351 --> 01:51:46.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they reached that 10,000 years ago,</v>

4299
01:51:46.841 --> 01:51:51.400
<v Speaker 4>but I think every society probably reaches some point where everything is just</v>

4300
01:51:51.401 --> 01:51:53.260
<v Speaker 4>ones and Zeros on a database somewhere,</v>

4301
01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:53.561
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4302
01:51:53.561 --> 01:51:54.620
<v Speaker 4>and then it crashes.</v>

4303
01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:55.960
<v Speaker 4>It's a physical place,</v>

4304
01:51:55.961 --> 01:51:56.291
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4305
01:51:56.291 --> 01:51:57.730
<v Speaker 4>Where this stuff exists.</v>

4306
01:51:57.790 --> 01:51:57.891
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4307
01:51:57.891 --> 01:51:58.724
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

4308
01:51:58.740 --> 01:52:01.660
<v Speaker 4>all our email accounts exists somewhere was huge.</v>

4309
01:52:01.661 --> 01:52:03.550
<v Speaker 4>Children's with Internet exchanges.</v>

4310
01:52:04.290 --> 01:52:05.123
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

4311
01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:06.120
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4312
01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:06.251
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4313
01:52:06.251 --> 01:52:07.570
<v Speaker 4>that's absolutely the case.</v>

4314
01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.470
<v Speaker 4>But also if something happens in the grid goes down and we,</v>

4315
01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:13.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're hit right?</v>

4316
01:52:13.061 --> 01:52:15.910
<v Speaker 4>If a manatee yeah,</v>

4317
01:52:15.970 --> 01:52:19.360
<v Speaker 4>for sure of what what Dr Robert Schoch was talking about.</v>

4318
01:52:19.361 --> 01:52:23.650
<v Speaker 4>If there's a fucking lightning storm that he really torches buildings and starts</v>

4319
01:52:23.651 --> 01:52:24.550
<v Speaker 4>everything on fire,</v>

4320
01:52:24.940 --> 01:52:26.440
<v Speaker 4>good luck accessing all that shit.</v>

4321
01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:27.400
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

4322
01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.710
<v Speaker 4>if human beings just skip a generation,</v>

4323
01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:32.670
<v Speaker 4>like we have a generation of turmoil and chaos and,</v>

4324
01:52:32.830 --> 01:52:35.050
<v Speaker 4>and then we slowly rebuild civilization.</v>

4325
01:52:35.200 --> 01:52:37.180
<v Speaker 4>How many of those people are gonna Understand Computer Code?</v>

4326
01:52:37.181 --> 01:52:38.770
<v Speaker 4>How many of these people are gonna Understand Linux?</v>

4327
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:42.280
<v Speaker 4>How many of these people that are coming up without any education from a formal</v>

4328
01:52:42.281 --> 01:52:43.114
<v Speaker 4>university,</v>

4329
01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:46.160
<v Speaker 4>no Internet connection whatsoever for perhaps</v>

4330
01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:46.971
<v Speaker 3>hundreds of years.</v>

4331
01:52:46.971 --> 01:52:49.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like the resetting of civilization you talked about earlier.</v>

4332
01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:49.860
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

4333
01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:50.870
<v Speaker 3>Start all over again.</v>

4334
01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:51.950
<v Speaker 3>And that's when the aliens come.</v>

4335
01:52:51.951 --> 01:52:53.240
<v Speaker 3>Cause they know we can't do anything.</v>

4336
01:52:53.241 --> 01:52:55.360
<v Speaker 3>Withdraw Shit on cloud tap type.</v>

4337
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:56.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4338
01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:59.360
<v Speaker 3>They wait until we can't take pictures anymore and then they come back and</v>

4339
01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:00.090
<v Speaker 3>reengineer.</v>

4340
01:53:00.090 --> 01:53:00.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4341
01:53:00.530 --> 01:53:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Right now they're just relying on the fact that nobody can frame a shot.</v>

4342
01:53:03.711 --> 01:53:04.544
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4343
01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:09.950
<v Speaker 3>the weirdest thing about the alien theory was that they came down and</v>

4344
01:53:09.951 --> 01:53:12.800
<v Speaker 3>genetically manipulated lower hominids.</v>

4345
01:53:13.090 --> 01:53:14.870
<v Speaker 3>That's the species.</v>

4346
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:15.910
<v Speaker 3>That's the weirder ones.</v>

4347
01:53:16.160 --> 01:53:17.330
<v Speaker 3>Or that they are,</v>

4348
01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:17.871
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

4349
01:53:17.871 --> 01:53:18.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4350
01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:18.321
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4351
01:53:18.321 --> 01:53:21.860
<v Speaker 3>later evolved version of us coming back to check on us.</v>

4352
01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>

4353
01:53:22.490 --> 01:53:23.050
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

4354
01:53:23.050 --> 01:53:23.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4355
01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:24.890
<v Speaker 3>And that's the other thing too,</v>

4356
01:53:24.891 --> 01:53:29.780
<v Speaker 3>is about that archetypal image of the alien with the gray hair.</v>

4357
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:32.840
<v Speaker 3>And the big black eyes is that if you go,</v>

4358
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:34.820
<v Speaker 3>you go down from Australia,</v>

4359
01:53:34.821 --> 01:53:38.300
<v Speaker 3>pithy kiss to home modern homosapien.</v>

4360
01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:39.320
<v Speaker 3>If you make this connect,</v>

4361
01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.120
<v Speaker 3>you see this hunched over,</v>

4362
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:42.470
<v Speaker 3>very hairy,</v>

4363
01:53:42.471 --> 01:53:43.790
<v Speaker 3>almost champ,</v>

4364
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:46.700
<v Speaker 3>like humanoid and then standing up.</v>

4365
01:53:46.701 --> 01:53:47.090
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

4366
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:51.290
<v Speaker 3>but losing all of his hair and the head is much larger doubling of the human</v>

4367
01:53:51.291 --> 01:53:53.270
<v Speaker 3>brain size over a period of 2 million years.</v>

4368
01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:53.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4369
01:53:53.650 --> 01:53:54.483
<v Speaker 3>where's that going?</v>

4370
01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:55.491
<v Speaker 3>Is that going to keep going?</v>

4371
01:53:55.491 --> 01:53:55.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4372
01:53:55.641 --> 01:53:56.270
<v Speaker 3>if it keeps going,</v>

4373
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:57.110
<v Speaker 3>this is what you're going to get.</v>

4374
01:53:57.111 --> 01:54:00.410
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna get a fee feeble thing with a giant head.</v>

4375
01:54:00.411 --> 01:54:01.520
<v Speaker 3>And that's what these aliens are.</v>

4376
01:54:01.521 --> 01:54:03.620
<v Speaker 3>They're always feeble with giant heads.</v>

4377
01:54:03.650 --> 01:54:04.250
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

4378
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4379
01:54:04.820 --> 01:54:05.481
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>

4380
01:54:05.481 --> 01:54:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4381
01:54:06.110 --> 01:54:06.771
<v Speaker 3>and if they left,</v>

4382
01:54:06.771 --> 01:54:06.981
<v Speaker 3>left,</v>

4383
01:54:06.981 --> 01:54:08.930
<v Speaker 3>they've been living off earth for a long time.</v>

4384
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4385
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.651
<v Speaker 3>Then,</v>

4386
01:54:09.651 --> 01:54:09.831
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4387
01:54:09.831 --> 01:54:10.361
<v Speaker 3>you're buddies.</v>

4388
01:54:10.361 --> 01:54:10.860
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4389
01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:11.860
<v Speaker 3>they're very out of shape.</v>

4390
01:54:11.960 --> 01:54:12.111
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

4391
01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:13.880
<v Speaker 3>they also have no penises or Vaginas,</v>

4392
01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:17.160
<v Speaker 3>so they realize that saves a lot of times.</v>

4393
01:54:17.720 --> 01:54:19.160
<v Speaker 3>That gives you time to get stuff done.</v>

4394
01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:19.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

4395
01:54:19.860 --> 01:54:22.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm already there and it's more of a meritocracy.</v>

4396
01:54:22.930 --> 01:54:24.830
<v Speaker 3>You're not banging people based on their tits and ass.</v>

4397
01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:26.930
<v Speaker 3>You don't have that anymore.</v>

4398
01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:29.090
<v Speaker 3>There's no more that you just more wasted time.</v>

4399
01:54:29.150 --> 01:54:29.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4400
01:54:29.391 --> 01:54:32.720
<v Speaker 3>Just sharing your thoughts transparently through the air.</v>

4401
01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:33.350
<v Speaker 3>No worries.</v>

4402
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:35.840
<v Speaker 3>You don't need an orb like in the woody Allen movie.</v>

4403
01:54:36.430 --> 01:54:38.090
<v Speaker 3>Don't even need to pick things up anymore.</v>

4404
01:54:38.091 --> 01:54:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Everything's telekinetic.</v>

4405
01:54:39.170 --> 01:54:39.570
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4406
01:54:39.570 --> 01:54:41.300
<v Speaker 3>Using that giant head to move shit around.</v>

4407
01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Never have to leave your house like your pod.</v>

4408
01:54:44.630 --> 01:54:47.980
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy that worked supposedly a pan.</v>

4409
01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:50.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you really worked at area 51 but the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4417
01:54:58.191 --> 01:54:59.024
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of those,</v>

4418
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.830
<v Speaker 3>it can't,</v>

4419
01:54:59.830 --> 01:55:00.663
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

4420
01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:02.840
<v Speaker 3>it's just dealing with him as an individual to go,</v>

4421
01:55:02.841 --> 01:55:03.111
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

4422
01:55:03.111 --> 01:55:03.944
<v Speaker 3>this guy isn't,</v>

4423
01:55:04.670 --> 01:55:05.550
<v Speaker 3>he isn't a,</v>

4424
01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:10.370
<v Speaker 3>the firebrand Ufo believer that some people want them to be and he's not the</v>

4425
01:55:10.371 --> 01:55:11.960
<v Speaker 3>lunatic that other people want it to be.</v>

4426
01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:15.290
<v Speaker 3>But he didn't tell the truth about his education.</v>

4427
01:55:15.291 --> 01:55:15.501
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4428
01:55:15.501 --> 01:55:16.251
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the case?</v>

4429
01:55:16.251 --> 01:55:16.460
<v Speaker 3>There's isn't.</v>

4430
01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:16.970
<v Speaker 3>There's some,</v>

4431
01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:18.380
<v Speaker 3>some finagling about,</v>

4432
01:55:18.530 --> 01:55:18.921
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4433
01:55:18.921 --> 01:55:21.050
<v Speaker 3>Well definitely like the records of his education,</v>

4434
01:55:21.110 --> 01:55:21.501
<v Speaker 3>if they,</v>

4435
01:55:21.501 --> 01:55:22.670
<v Speaker 3>if he was telling the truth,</v>

4436
01:55:22.671 --> 01:55:24.380
<v Speaker 3>those records aren't around anymore.</v>

4437
01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:25.011
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

4438
01:55:25.011 --> 01:55:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4439
01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.450
<v Speaker 3>So if he was telling the truth,</v>

4440
01:55:26.451 --> 01:55:28.190
<v Speaker 3>somebody expunged and yet,</v>

4441
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.611
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>

4442
01:55:28.611 --> 01:55:29.361
<v Speaker 3>and he's basically,</v>

4443
01:55:29.361 --> 01:55:30.021
<v Speaker 3>his argument is,</v>

4444
01:55:30.021 --> 01:55:30.740
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

4445
01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:32.270
<v Speaker 3>if I didn't have this education,</v>

4446
01:55:32.630 --> 01:55:35.180
<v Speaker 3>why was I hired to do this job?</v>

4447
01:55:35.210 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

4448
01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:36.793
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

4449
01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:37.101
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4450
01:55:37.101 --> 01:55:39.400
<v Speaker 3>I was hired to do this research by the government and,</v>

4451
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:42.080
<v Speaker 3>and they have their records of me doing the research.</v>

4452
01:55:42.770 --> 01:55:45.480
<v Speaker 3>So why did they let me do this research for all these years if I didn't have the</v>

4453
01:55:45.481 --> 01:55:46.410
<v Speaker 3>education to do it?</v>

4454
01:55:46.650 --> 01:55:48.600
<v Speaker 3>But wouldn't there be someone that went to school with him?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think there aren't people.</v>

4476
01:56:06.450 --> 01:56:06.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4477
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:07.051
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4479
01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:08.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

4480

<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

4482
01:56:09.351 --> 01:56:10.440
<v Speaker 3>you enjoyed the documentary.</v>

4483
01:56:10.441 --> 01:56:11.520
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember what the name of it is?</v>

4484
01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:12.680
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4485
01:56:12.710 --> 01:56:12.990

4486
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:13.471
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

4487
01:56:13.471 --> 01:56:14.041
<v Speaker 3>what is it called?</v>

4488
01:56:14.041 --> 01:56:15.890
<v Speaker 3>Bob Lewis are the guy who,</v>

4489
01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:16.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4490
01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:16.771
<v Speaker 3>it's a new,</v>

4491
01:56:16.771 --> 01:56:16.981
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

4492
01:56:16.981 --> 01:56:17.460
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4493
01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 3>somebody emailed me about that.</v>

4494
01:56:19.180 --> 01:56:19.471
<v Speaker 3>I'll say it.</v>

4495
01:56:19.471 --> 01:56:20.304
<v Speaker 3>And the guy who made it,</v>

4496
01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:21.060
<v Speaker 3>that's a real problem.</v>

4497
01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:21.930
<v Speaker 3>Like Ufo,</v>

4498
01:56:22.080 --> 01:56:24.630
<v Speaker 3>even this one is a fairly rational documentary,</v>

4499
01:56:24.631 --> 01:56:25.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

4500
01:56:25.290 --> 01:56:26.123
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4501
01:56:27.090 --> 01:56:28.170
<v Speaker 3>but there's so bad.</v>

4502
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:29.461
<v Speaker 3>Even this one,</v>

4503
01:56:29.461 --> 01:56:29.910
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

4504
01:56:29.910 --> 01:56:31.830
<v Speaker 3>it's just got just bad filmmaking.</v>

4505
01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:32.840
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

4506
01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Bobby's our area 51 and flying saucers.</v>

4507
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:36.863
<v Speaker 3>That's the,</v>

4508
01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:38.940
<v Speaker 3>the title 4.1.</v>

4509
01:56:38.970 --> 01:56:39.390
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

4510
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:40.050
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4511
01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:41.190
<v Speaker 3>Jeremy Cor.</v>

4513
01:56:41.950 --> 01:56:42.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4514
01:56:42.250 --> 01:56:43.410
<v Speaker 3>I think he's the gentleman.</v>

4515
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:43.711
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4516
01:56:43.711 --> 01:56:44.720
<v Speaker 3>And it's really accepted it all.</v>

4517
01:56:44.780 --> 01:56:47.020
<v Speaker 3>But it has like Mickey Rourke doing voiceovers,</v>

01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:49.720
<v Speaker 3>voiceovers at some point.</v>

4519

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.800
<v Speaker 3>a barfly so doing it as book Koski that would be fine.</v>

4521
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:57.540
<v Speaker 3>It's got 20% on rotten tomatoes,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and I know what I saw is one sort of tracing the,</v>

4534
01:57:18.961 --> 01:57:19.794
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4535

01:57:21.061 --> 01:57:21.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

4537
01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:25.740
<v Speaker 3>the disclosure hearings at the Press Club in Washington.</v>

4538
01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:26.041
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're going to bring me back in.</v>

4540
01:57:26.841 --> 01:57:27.330

01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:27.630
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

4542
01:57:27.630 --> 01:57:28.560
<v Speaker 3>I love the man.</v>

4543
01:57:28.561 --> 01:57:29.610
<v Speaker 3>I really wish they were real.</v>

4544
01:57:29.611 --> 01:57:32.430
<v Speaker 3>But I'm telling you my experience talking to these people.</v>

4545
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:34.160
<v Speaker 3>When I did that Scifi show,</v>

4546
01:57:34.161 --> 01:57:34.500
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

4547
01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:34.710
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

4548
01:57:34.710 --> 01:57:36.150
<v Speaker 3>this is all nonsense.</v>

4549
01:57:36.510 --> 01:57:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4550
01:57:37.050 --> 01:57:37.883
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

4551
01:57:38.910 --> 01:57:41.160
<v Speaker 3>that maybe those people were nonsense.</v>

4552
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:43.770
<v Speaker 3>But the train military,</v>

4553
01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:46.350
<v Speaker 3>air traffic controllers,</v>

4554
01:57:46.351 --> 01:57:47.184
<v Speaker 3>the pilots,</v>

4555
01:57:47.410 --> 01:57:48.243
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

4556
01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:49.560
<v Speaker 3>Government officials.</v>

4557
01:57:49.561 --> 01:57:49.821
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

4560
01:57:50.821 --> 01:57:51.590
<v Speaker 3>Fif.</v>

4561
01:57:51.590 --> 01:57:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4562
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:54.990
<v Speaker 3>the governor of Arizona is one of the guys in,</v>

4563
01:57:54.991 --> 01:57:55.561
<v Speaker 3>I know what I saw.</v>

4564
01:57:55.561 --> 01:57:56.394
<v Speaker 3>And out of the blue.</v>

4565
01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:56.671
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

4566
01:57:56.671 --> 01:58:00.010
<v Speaker 3>He was the king either was told to like mock it,</v>

4567
01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:01.050
<v Speaker 3>brought it out,</v>

4568
01:58:01.050 --> 01:58:03.430
<v Speaker 3>guy dressed like alien.</v>

4569
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:04.320
<v Speaker 3>These documents,</v>

4570
01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:06.900
<v Speaker 3>he talks about how much he deeply regrets doing that.</v>

4571
01:58:06.901 --> 01:58:07.980
<v Speaker 3>And this is from out of the blue?</v>

4572
01:58:08.070 --> 01:58:08.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

4573
01:58:08.370 --> 01:58:09.570
<v Speaker 3>really interesting.</v>

4574
01:58:09.810 --> 01:58:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Deeply grip.</v>

4575
01:58:10.380 --> 01:58:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Maybe now it was not a governor anymore.</v>

4576
01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:13.650
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to get a new angle and his career.</v>

4577
01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:14.670
<v Speaker 3>But he basically said,</v>

4578
01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:15.503
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

4579
01:58:15.840 --> 01:58:19.740
<v Speaker 3>tens of thousands of people saw these craft and we lied.</v>

4580
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:20.470
<v Speaker 3>We came out,</v>

4581
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:21.303
<v Speaker 3>we lied.</v>

4582
01:58:21.650 --> 01:58:24.300
<v Speaker 3>And he did he say who directed him to lie?</v>

4583
01:58:24.690 --> 01:58:25.171
<v Speaker 3>He didn't really,</v>

4584
01:58:25.171 --> 01:58:26.450
<v Speaker 3>he didn't say he was really directed dude.</v>

4585
01:58:26.451 --> 01:58:30.210
<v Speaker 3>He said he felt like people were in a state of panic and he thought he could</v>

4586
01:58:30.211 --> 01:58:32.940
<v Speaker 3>relieve some of the fear by making a joke of it.</v>

4587
01:58:32.941 --> 01:58:37.470
<v Speaker 3>And he said he really regret he really just wanted to make relax people cause he</v>

4588
01:58:37.471 --> 01:58:37.681
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

4589
01:58:37.681 --> 01:58:38.730
<v Speaker 3>he didn't know what else to do.</v>

4590
01:58:38.731 --> 01:58:39.390
<v Speaker 3>He said he didn't,</v>

4591
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:40.050
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

4592
01:58:40.050 --> 01:58:40.883
<v Speaker 3>I saw it,</v>

4593
01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 3>everyone else saw it.</v>

4594
01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:43.413
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4595
01:58:43.420 --> 01:58:44.890
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know how to calm people down.</v>

4596
01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:49.570
<v Speaker 2>So I made this joke and he said he regrets it to this day.</v>

4597
01:58:49.610 --> 01:58:54.410
<v Speaker 4>There's another thing about these UFO experiences and alien experiences where</v>

4598
01:58:54.411 --> 01:58:55.730
<v Speaker 4>people really dive into them.</v>

4599
01:58:55.731 --> 01:58:57.920
<v Speaker 4>Third seems to be the AC,</v>

4600
01:58:57.921 --> 01:59:00.860
<v Speaker 4>the atheists version of religion to a lot of these folks.</v>

4601
01:59:00.861 --> 01:59:01.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4602
01:59:01.510 --> 01:59:02.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4603
01:59:02.230 --> 01:59:02.861
<v Speaker 2>Which again,</v>

4604
01:59:02.861 --> 01:59:03.130
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

4605
01:59:03.130 --> 01:59:04.240
<v Speaker 2>that I dismiss,</v>

4606
01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:04.960
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

4607
01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4608
01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:08.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's likely to be the case.</v>

4609
01:59:08.861 --> 01:59:11.080
<v Speaker 2>That they're here to save us or they're not.</v>

4610
01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:12.050
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4611
01:59:12.050 --> 01:59:12.883
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4612
01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:13.430
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4613
01:59:13.430 --> 01:59:13.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>

4614
01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:14.211
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4615
01:59:14.211 --> 01:59:16.190
<v Speaker 4>the people that are believers that are really into it,</v>

4616
01:59:16.220 --> 01:59:20.030
<v Speaker 4>it seems to be that instead of focusing on a deity,</v>

4617
01:59:20.031 --> 01:59:22.380
<v Speaker 4>they're focusing on an alien civilization.</v>

4618
01:59:22.381 --> 01:59:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Transferring it to</v>

4619
01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:26.930
<v Speaker 4>daddy will save us.</v>

4620
01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:27.350
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4621

02:02:32.451 --> 02:02:33.284
<v Speaker 4>it was always,</v>

4741

4744
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.541
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a,</v>

4745
02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:46.541
<v Speaker 4>there's a video on youtube where they show the stabilized image of this animal</v>

4746
02:02:46.731 --> 02:02:47.720
<v Speaker 4>moving across the,</v>

4747
02:02:47.730 --> 02:02:47.991
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

4748
02:02:47.991 --> 02:02:48.411
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

4749
02:02:48.411 --> 02:02:52.340
<v Speaker 4>I've been to that area where they saw that thing that's really interesting cause</v>

4750
02:02:52.341 --> 02:02:53.510
<v Speaker 4>it's in your show that yet.</v>

4751
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:56.920
<v Speaker 4>But there's still like people like anthropologists who will still say the,</v>

4752
02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:57.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4753
02:02:57.321 --> 02:03:01.520
<v Speaker 4>that there's clear evidence that Kendall and structure of this big foot fucking</v>

4754
02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:01.960
<v Speaker 4>sanctuary,</v>

4755
02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.080
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't match human.</v>

4756
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:05.040
<v Speaker 4>If there's a single thing that makes sense,</v>

4757
02:03:05.041 --> 02:03:05.590
<v Speaker 4>the vibe,</v>

4758
02:03:05.590 --> 02:03:06.060
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's there,</v>

4759
02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:07.490
<v Speaker 4>but it's not a single thing.</v>

4760
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:09.163
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4761
02:03:09.190 --> 02:03:10.023
<v Speaker 4>There has to be community.</v>

4762
02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:11.390
<v Speaker 4>The compelling,</v>

4763
02:03:11.480 --> 02:03:15.230
<v Speaker 4>interesting aspect of big foot is that there was an animal called</v>

4764
02:03:15.231 --> 02:03:19.640
<v Speaker 4>gigantopithecus that existed as recently as a hundred thousand years ago,</v>

4765
02:03:19.641 --> 02:03:24.440
<v Speaker 4>and they found teeth in the 1920s and apothecary shop and China that we're an</v>

4766
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:25.700
<v Speaker 4>unknown hominid.</v>

4767
02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:26.930
<v Speaker 4>And then they were like,</v>

4768
02:03:26.931 --> 02:03:27.830
<v Speaker 4>where'd you get these?</v>

4769
02:03:27.831 --> 02:03:31.610
<v Speaker 4>And then they found the area where they found them and they started discovering</v>

4770
02:03:31.611 --> 02:03:32.001
<v Speaker 4>more.</v>

4771
02:03:32.001 --> 02:03:33.590
<v Speaker 4>And they've found some job,</v>

4772
02:03:33.591 --> 02:03:36.170
<v Speaker 4>bone fragments and some various bones.</v>

4773
02:03:36.190 --> 02:03:36.740
<v Speaker 4>He see this,</v>

4774
02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:37.430
<v Speaker 4>look at this,</v>

4775
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:38.180
<v Speaker 4>look at that guy.</v>

4776
02:03:38.180 --> 02:03:39.013
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

4777
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:40.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean get the funk out.</v>

4778
02:03:40.940 --> 02:03:41.450
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

4779
02:03:41.450 --> 02:03:43.160
<v Speaker 4>That's the guy that's amazing.</v>

4780
02:03:43.161 --> 02:03:43.820
<v Speaker 4>That's him.</v>

4781
02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:44.580
<v Speaker 4>And he admits it.</v>

4782
02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:45.413
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4783
02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:45.950
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4784
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:46.610
<v Speaker 4>Same.</v>

4785
02:03:46.610 --> 02:03:48.110
<v Speaker 4>He admits it and got to talk to him.</v>

4786
02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:51.050
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking him talked about it.</v>

4787
02:03:51.051 --> 02:03:51.800
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

4788
02:03:51.800 --> 02:03:52.760
<v Speaker 4>told the story.</v>

4789
02:03:52.761 --> 02:03:53.211
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>

4790
02:03:53.211 --> 02:03:53.541
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

4791
02:03:53.541 --> 02:03:53.781
<v Speaker 4>ready.</v>

4792
02:03:53.781 --> 02:03:55.340
<v Speaker 4>Go start walking on shape.</v>

4793
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:56.240
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4794
02:03:56.420 --> 02:04:01.420
<v Speaker 4>So put that guy in a big old stupid fucking furry suit and you have big foot and</v>

4795
02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:02.841
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>

4796
02:04:02.841 --> 02:04:04.070
<v Speaker 4>It's 100% him.</v>

4797
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:05.143
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4798
02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:07.010
<v Speaker 4>so does that mean there's not one out there?</v>

4799
02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:07.251
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4800
02:04:07.251 --> 02:04:11.060
<v Speaker 4>So Jai can't apathic this was a real animal that they think was a bipedal</v>

4801
02:04:11.061 --> 02:04:16.061
<v Speaker 4>hominid that lived somewhere around a hundred thousand years ago for sure.</v>

4802
02:04:16.190 --> 02:04:20.240
<v Speaker 4>But most likely coincide lived alongside human beings for eons.</v>

4803
02:04:20.241 --> 02:04:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4804
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:24.520
<v Speaker 4>And this thing was an eight to 10 foot tall and North Sea.</v>

4805
02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:24.801
<v Speaker 4>She,</v>

4806
02:04:24.801 --> 02:04:26.090
<v Speaker 4>if you get an image of,</v>

4807
02:04:26.091 --> 02:04:26.420
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4808
02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:31.420
<v Speaker 4>the photo of a recreation of a Chai can't tow pikas next to a modern human</v>

4809
02:04:32.451 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 4>being.</v>

4810
02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:33.493
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting.</v>

4811
02:04:33.710 --> 02:04:35.300
<v Speaker 4>It was huge.</v>

4812
02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:38.730
<v Speaker 4>A huge buy fossil record of it.</v>

4813
02:04:38.780 --> 02:04:39.590
<v Speaker 4>It's a real thing.</v>

4814
02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:39.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4815
02:04:39.900 --> 02:04:40.051
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4816
02:04:40.051 --> 02:04:40.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean it makes sense.</v>

4817
02:04:40.981 --> 02:04:41.814
<v Speaker 4>Like if a gorilla,</v>

4818
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:42.030
<v Speaker 4>we would,</v>

4819
02:04:42.030 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 4>it was a girl was like 500 pounds.</v>

4820
02:04:43.771 --> 02:04:43.951
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4821
02:04:43.951 --> 02:04:48.030
<v Speaker 4>the gorillas are considered mythical creatures until like 18,</v>

4822
02:04:48.031 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 4>19.</v>

4823
02:04:48.750 --> 02:04:48.871
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4824
02:04:48.871 --> 02:04:49.411
<v Speaker 4>scroll up,</v>

4825
02:04:49.411 --> 02:04:49.711
<v Speaker 4>Jamie.</v>

4826
02:04:49.711 --> 02:04:51.480
<v Speaker 4>There's a better image right above you,</v>

4827
02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:55.590
<v Speaker 4>or was it even the 1900 says grills were first just like officially discovered</v>

4828
02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:55.921
<v Speaker 4>does.</v>

4829
02:04:55.921 --> 02:04:59.430
<v Speaker 4>So there's a better one where that shows up with the,</v>

4830
02:04:59.440 --> 02:05:01.620
<v Speaker 4>the fake bigfoot wrapped around his</v>

4831
02:05:03.290 --> 02:05:04.123
<v Speaker 4>keeps crawling.</v>

4832
02:05:04.860 --> 02:05:05.191
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

4833
02:05:05.191 --> 02:05:06.024
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4834
02:05:06.260 --> 02:05:06.531
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4835
02:05:06.531 --> 02:05:06.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4836
02:05:06.630 --> 02:05:06.940
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

4837
02:05:06.940 --> 02:05:07.650
<v Speaker 4>that's a good one.</v>

4838
02:05:07.650 --> 02:05:07.861
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4839
02:05:07.861 --> 02:05:08.370
<v Speaker 4>there is,</v>

4840
02:05:08.370 --> 02:05:09.090
<v Speaker 4>that's the guy.</v>

4841
02:05:09.090 --> 02:05:09.780
<v Speaker 4>That's the guy.</v>

4842
02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:11.280
<v Speaker 4>So that's what that thing looked like.</v>

4843
02:05:11.590 --> 02:05:12.900
<v Speaker 4>So if you saw that in the woods,</v>

4844
02:05:12.901 --> 02:05:13.201
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>

4845
02:05:13.201 --> 02:05:14.910
<v Speaker 4>holy fuck and shit.</v>

4846
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:15.480
<v Speaker 4>Hell yeah.</v>

4847
02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:16.380
<v Speaker 4>Eight foot tall,</v>

4848
02:05:16.381 --> 02:05:19.650
<v Speaker 4>gigantic hairy ape creature.</v>

4849
02:05:19.710 --> 02:05:21.510
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't touch it like that guys touching on.</v>

4850
02:05:21.530 --> 02:05:22.363
<v Speaker 4>He's a plant.</v>

4851
02:05:22.530 --> 02:05:23.363
<v Speaker 4>That's his buddy.</v>

4852
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:27.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you see dudes from Russia with bears and shit,</v>

4853
02:05:29.040 --> 02:05:29.191
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

4854
02:05:29.191 --> 02:05:30.330
<v Speaker 4>so that's a real animal.</v>

4855
02:05:30.331 --> 02:05:35.310
<v Speaker 4>So that's probably why there's so many mythological stories about this thing.</v>

4856
02:05:35.311 --> 02:05:38.160
<v Speaker 4>And the native Americans have more than a hundred different names for these</v>

4857
02:05:38.161 --> 02:05:41.700
<v Speaker 4>creatures along the various tribes signed that they thought was extinct for</v>

4858
02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:42.573
<v Speaker 4>around,</v>

4859
02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:43.560
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4860
02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:44.393
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4861
02:05:44.630 --> 02:05:46.200
<v Speaker 4>Armored plated fish,</v>

4862
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:46.710
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4863
02:05:46.710 --> 02:05:46.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4864
02:05:46.921 --> 02:05:47.341
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>

4865
02:05:47.341 --> 02:05:50.760
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of animals that mean that's cryptozoology in a nutshell.</v>

4866
02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:53.970
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of animals that we think are extinct that probably aren't,</v>

4867
02:05:53.971 --> 02:05:55.860
<v Speaker 4>but that one is very unlikely one,</v>

4868
02:05:56.370 --> 02:05:57.060
<v Speaker 4>cause it's,</v>

4869
02:05:57.060 --> 02:05:57.451
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4870
02:05:57.451 --> 02:05:59.790
<v Speaker 4>it needed an enormous supply of food.</v>

4871
02:05:59.791 --> 02:06:00.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4872
02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:00.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4873
02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:01.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a huge,</v>

4874
02:06:01.501 --> 02:06:02.340
<v Speaker 4>huge animal.</v>

4875
02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4876
02:06:02.910 --> 02:06:07.770
<v Speaker 4>But the thing about it is that the sightings occur all in the Pacific northwest,</v>

4877
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:10.340
<v Speaker 4>which if you follow the Bering land mass,</v>

4878
02:06:10.620 --> 02:06:13.080
<v Speaker 4>that's where they would have come across.</v>

4879
02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:14.730
<v Speaker 4>If they came across with humans,</v>

4880
02:06:14.731 --> 02:06:18.030
<v Speaker 4>they would've come across into Alaska where there's a lot of sightings and down</v>

4881
02:06:18.031 --> 02:06:20.180
<v Speaker 4>into the Pacific northwest where there's a lot of sightings.</v>

4882
02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:20.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4883
02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:22.230
<v Speaker 4>But there's sightings all over the country now.</v>

4884
02:06:22.530 --> 02:06:25.470
<v Speaker 4>But is there any fossil record outside of Africa specific?</v>

4885
02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:25.860
<v Speaker 4>I get up.</v>

4886
02:06:25.860 --> 02:06:26.490
<v Speaker 4>I think it's new.</v>

4887
02:06:26.490 --> 02:06:26.700
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4888
02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:26.971
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4889
02:06:26.971 --> 02:06:27.480
<v Speaker 4>there's not.</v>

4890
02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:27.691
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4891
02:06:27.691 --> 02:06:28.410
<v Speaker 4>there's not.</v>

4892
02:06:28.410 --> 02:06:29.243
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4893
02:06:29.310 --> 02:06:29.551
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4894
02:06:29.551 --> 02:06:29.970
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>

4895
02:06:29.970 --> 02:06:31.410
<v Speaker 4>it's a Asia actually.</v>

4896
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Asia is where they find them.</v>

4897
02:06:33.090 --> 02:06:33.271
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4898
02:06:33.271 --> 02:06:34.104
<v Speaker 4>It's not even Africa.</v>

4899
02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:35.520
<v Speaker 4>Ironically.</v>

4900
02:06:36.810 --> 02:06:37.643
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4901
02:06:37.890 --> 02:06:38.723
<v Speaker 4>Asians are tiny.</v>

4902
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.410
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4903
02:06:39.410 --> 02:06:39.660
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

4904
02:06:39.660 --> 02:06:40.110
<v Speaker 4>Tiny piece.</v>

4905
02:06:40.110 --> 02:06:40.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4906
02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:41.251
<v Speaker 4>it's not a person,</v>

4907
02:06:41.251 --> 02:06:42.084
<v Speaker 4>not this one.</v>

4908
02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:42.601
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

4909
02:06:42.601 --> 02:06:43.170
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4910
02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:43.680
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4911
02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:47.250
<v Speaker 4>it's compelling in the sense that there was a bunch of different kinds of</v>

4912
02:06:47.251 --> 02:06:48.870
<v Speaker 4>hominids that existed.</v>

4913
02:06:49.150 --> 02:06:49.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4914
02:06:49.690 --> 02:06:50.230
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4915
02:06:50.230 --> 02:06:53.010
<v Speaker 4>we now know that we interbred with neanderthals.</v>

4916
02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:53.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4917
02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:53.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4918
02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:54.480
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

4919
02:06:54.480 --> 02:06:56.940
<v Speaker 4>most of us have Mandy total DNA in us.</v>

4920
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.480
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

4921
02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:57.630
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4922
02:06:57.630 --> 02:06:58.770
<v Speaker 4>most white folks,</v>

4923
02:06:59.040 --> 02:06:59.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4924
02:06:59.790 --> 02:07:00.630
<v Speaker 4>which is interesting,</v>

4925
02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:01.200
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4926
02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:01.741
<v Speaker 4>Because it was,</v>

4927
02:07:01.741 --> 02:07:02.670
<v Speaker 4>it was the opposite.</v>

4928
02:07:02.700 --> 02:07:04.680
<v Speaker 4>If it was a black people had it,</v>

4929
02:07:04.681 --> 02:07:06.540
<v Speaker 4>it would be a really controversial subject,</v>

4930
02:07:06.570 --> 02:07:06.810
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4931
02:07:06.810 --> 02:07:07.920
<v Speaker 4>But instead it's dumb.</v>

4932
02:07:07.921 --> 02:07:08.754
<v Speaker 4>White people like me,</v>

4933
02:07:09.090 --> 02:07:13.230
<v Speaker 4>I have 57% more in the end are tall DNA than the average person.</v>

4934
02:07:14.010 --> 02:07:14.371
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

4935
02:07:14.371 --> 02:07:16.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna argue that neither.</v>

4936
02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:16.681
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

4937
02:07:16.681 --> 02:07:16.991
<v Speaker 4>I knew,</v>

4938
02:07:16.991 --> 02:07:18.240
<v Speaker 4>I knew something was off.</v>

4939
02:07:18.241 --> 02:07:20.040
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure my Indiana till count is low.</v>

4940
02:07:21.180 --> 02:07:22.020
<v Speaker 4>You'd be surprised.</v>

4941
02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:23.270
<v Speaker 4>The clubby carrier,</v>

4942
02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:25.013
<v Speaker 4>I got rid of that problem.</v>

4943
02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:26.580
<v Speaker 4>But that's a European thing.</v>

4944
02:07:26.610 --> 02:07:27.780
<v Speaker 4>A lot of Europeans,</v>

4945
02:07:27.781 --> 02:07:28.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4946
02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:29.610
<v Speaker 4>in a breadwinner and he has to tell us by the way,</v>

4947
02:07:29.611 --> 02:07:31.960
<v Speaker 4>that a way longer run than we have a,</v>

4948
02:07:32.070 --> 02:07:32.251
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

4949
02:07:32.251 --> 02:07:33.150
<v Speaker 4>they call it Nice Europe.</v>

4950
02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:33.410
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

4951
02:07:33.410 --> 02:07:33.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4952
02:07:33.570 --> 02:07:37.000
<v Speaker 4>wait before they were around for hundred thousand years on change.</v>

4953
02:07:37.001 --> 02:07:42.001
<v Speaker 4>I mean homosapiens have only been around all 300,000 shares and our ego says,</v>

4954
02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:42.821
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4955
02:07:42.821 --> 02:07:44.230
<v Speaker 4>he usurped and we,</v>

4956
02:07:44.370 --> 02:07:44.680
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

4957
02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:46.180
<v Speaker 4>we drove them into extinction.</v>

4958
02:07:46.690 --> 02:07:47.291
<v Speaker 4>And in fact,</v>

4959
02:07:47.291 --> 02:07:47.411
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4960
02:07:47.411 --> 02:07:49.340
<v Speaker 4>we just made them into extinction.</v>

4961
02:07:52.590 --> 02:07:53.470
<v Speaker 4>Just dilute it up.</v>

4962
02:07:54.260 --> 02:07:54.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4963
02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:55.331
<v Speaker 4>We were ruined.</v>

4964
02:07:55.331 --> 02:07:55.960
<v Speaker 4>Their purity.</v>

4965
02:07:55.960 --> 02:07:56.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4966
02:07:56.120 --> 02:07:57.550
<v Speaker 4>We probably drugged them a neutered them.</v>

4967
02:07:57.820 --> 02:07:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4968
02:07:58.300 --> 02:07:59.980
<v Speaker 4>Probably once we figured out how to do that.</v>

4969
02:08:00.090 --> 02:08:00.430
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

4970
02:08:00.430 --> 02:08:01.210
<v Speaker 4>which is early.</v>

4971
02:08:01.210 --> 02:08:02.320
<v Speaker 4>Do you know about that?</v>

4972
02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:04.450
<v Speaker 4>A hobbit person thing that they found?</v>

4973
02:08:04.451 --> 02:08:05.570
<v Speaker 4>The island of Flores.</v>

4974
02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:10.190
<v Speaker 4>That's another one that they didn't know until that it's free fee.</v>

4975
02:08:10.850 --> 02:08:13.390
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I think just the name of it.</v>

4976
02:08:13.391 --> 02:08:15.580
<v Speaker 4>It's a tiny little person like thing.</v>

4977
02:08:15.880 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 4>There was like three feet tall and had large feet.</v>

4978
02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:20.440
<v Speaker 4>What are you guys looking at?</v>

4979
02:08:20.441 --> 02:08:22.090
<v Speaker 4>Me Not Bro.</v>

4980
02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:22.451
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4981
02:08:22.451 --> 02:08:24.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying we all have our own genetic,</v>

4982
02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:25.120
<v Speaker 4>his style.</v>

4983
02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:30.120
<v Speaker 4>That was a real thing that recently an image and that that existed.</v>

4984
02:08:32.350 --> 02:08:32.591
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4985
02:08:32.591 --> 02:08:35.980
<v Speaker 4>Homo florensiensis that's it.</v>

4986
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4987
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:40.300
<v Speaker 4>and they existed as recently as 14,000 years ago.</v>

4988
02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Found.</v>

4989
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:41.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4990
02:08:41.460 --> 02:08:41.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4991
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:42.670
<v Speaker 4>They coexist.</v>

4992
02:08:42.670 --> 02:08:44.170
<v Speaker 4>They coexisted with modern humans.</v>

4993
02:08:44.580 --> 02:08:47.860
<v Speaker 4>You and they think modern humans might have wiped them out because they were</v>

4994
02:08:47.861 --> 02:08:48.694
<v Speaker 4>probably,</v>

4995
02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:51.430
<v Speaker 4>they think there's some cannibal at not cannibalism,</v>

4996
02:08:51.431 --> 02:08:53.500
<v Speaker 4>but they preyed upon our children and stuff like that.</v>

4997
02:08:53.501 --> 02:08:54.334
<v Speaker 4>They hate us.</v>

4998
02:08:54.670 --> 02:08:55.503
<v Speaker 4>They hate us.</v>

4999
02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:57.480
<v Speaker 4>They were eating us well.</v>

5000
02:08:57.700 --> 02:08:58.590
<v Speaker 4>There was one of those,</v>

5001
02:08:58.630 --> 02:08:59.590
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I've read,</v>

5002
02:08:59.591 --> 02:09:01.660
<v Speaker 4>the speculation was that they might have a,</v>

5003
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:05.560
<v Speaker 4>there might've been an issue with them like invading and trying to see,</v>

5004
02:09:05.561 --> 02:09:05.741
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5005
02:09:05.741 --> 02:09:08.500
<v Speaker 4>like chimps have stolen babies and eating them.</v>

5006
02:09:08.890 --> 02:09:09.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5007
02:09:09.610 --> 02:09:11.230
<v Speaker 4>it's a really common thing.</v>

5008
02:09:11.231 --> 02:09:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Actually.</v>

5009
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:13.120
<v Speaker 4>Babies are delicious.</v>

5010
02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:15.640
<v Speaker 4>Well that's why people like lamb,</v>

5011
02:09:15.641 --> 02:09:16.474
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately.</v>

5012
02:09:18.490 --> 02:09:18.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5013
02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:19.780
<v Speaker 4>well exactly.</v>

5014
02:09:20.200 --> 02:09:20.651
<v Speaker 4>Well that was,</v>

5015
02:09:20.651 --> 02:09:25.510
<v Speaker 4>I heard it was a company that that produced a Vegan version of human flesh.</v>

5016
02:09:26.130 --> 02:09:30.490
<v Speaker 4>I just trying to sell to people in Papua New Guinea that's disgusting.</v>

5017
02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:32.710
<v Speaker 4>No longer allowed to eat human flesh.</v>

5018
02:09:32.711 --> 02:09:33.640
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

5019
02:09:34.330 --> 02:09:38.650
<v Speaker 4>I read this thing about people in New Guinea that were cannibals and they were</v>

5020
02:09:38.651 --> 02:09:42.340
<v Speaker 4>talking to them after World War II and they were trying to figure out how the</v>

5021
02:09:42.341 --> 02:09:43.300
<v Speaker 4>Europeans,</v>

5022
02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:47.380
<v Speaker 4>once they found out how many people were killed during World War II,</v>

5023
02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:50.650
<v Speaker 4>they were trying to figure out how the Europeans man to eat that much meat.</v>

5024
02:09:51.430 --> 02:09:51.761
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5025
02:09:51.761 --> 02:09:52.690
<v Speaker 4>And then they told them no,</v>

5026
02:09:52.691 --> 02:09:54.100
<v Speaker 4>they don't eat the people they killed.</v>

5027
02:09:54.101 --> 02:09:55.150
<v Speaker 4>And they were horrified.</v>

5028
02:09:55.540 --> 02:09:56.860
<v Speaker 4>They were like in waste,</v>

5029
02:09:56.890 --> 02:09:58.210
<v Speaker 4>you waste all that.</v>

5030
02:09:58.211 --> 02:09:59.830
<v Speaker 4>All the people that kill in battle.</v>

5031
02:10:00.150 --> 02:10:00.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5032
02:10:00.630 --> 02:10:01.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5033
02:10:01.420 --> 02:10:01.960
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

5034
02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:02.200
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

5035
02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:02.381
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5036
02:10:02.381 --> 02:10:02.980
<v Speaker 4>it would be hard.</v>

5037
02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:03.131
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5038
02:10:03.131 --> 02:10:03.710
<v Speaker 4>Well that's it.</v>

5039
02:10:03.710 --> 02:10:04.400
<v Speaker 4>That's a waste.</v>

5040
02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.110
<v Speaker 4>When it was a way to look at it and then they believe they absorbed the noble</v>

5041
02:10:08.111 --> 02:10:09.310
<v Speaker 4>qualities of their enemy,</v>

5042
02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:12.400
<v Speaker 4>only the good spots by eating certain spots.</v>

5043
02:10:12.401 --> 02:10:12.820
<v Speaker 4>You donate.</v>

5044
02:10:12.820 --> 02:10:12.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5045
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:13.470
<v Speaker 4>Have some if,</v>

5046
02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:13.810
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

5047
02:10:13.810 --> 02:10:14.261
<v Speaker 4>if you're,</v>

5048
02:10:14.261 --> 02:10:14.970
<v Speaker 4>if you killed someone,</v>

5049
02:10:14.970 --> 02:10:16.450
<v Speaker 4>a battle who you thought was truly,</v>

5050
02:10:16.451 --> 02:10:17.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5051
02:10:17.230 --> 02:10:18.250
<v Speaker 4>a great warrior,</v>

5052
02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.410
<v Speaker 4>that's what brings you back to the whole Ufo thing.</v>

5053
02:10:20.411 --> 02:10:21.720
<v Speaker 4>That makes it so compelling to me.</v>

5054
02:10:21.730 --> 02:10:26.730
<v Speaker 4>So we have really serious protocols for dealing with uncontacted tribes.</v>

5055
02:10:26.950 --> 02:10:29.380
<v Speaker 4>We don't engage with uncontacted tribes.</v>

5056
02:10:29.381 --> 02:10:29.920
<v Speaker 4>And we find,</v>

5057
02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:31.660
<v Speaker 4>I mean we almost universally at green,</v>

5058
02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:34.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean when the loggers do</v>

5059
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:36.470
<v Speaker 3>in the Amazon assholes and mean people,</v>

5060
02:10:36.471 --> 02:10:36.841
<v Speaker 3>but the,</v>

5061
02:10:36.841 --> 02:10:37.061
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5062
02:10:37.061 --> 02:10:39.050
<v Speaker 3>the idea in the scientific communities,</v>

5063
02:10:39.051 --> 02:10:40.430
<v Speaker 3>we should leave these people alone.</v>

5064
02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:42.770
<v Speaker 3>And so when they find these uncontacted tribes,</v>

5065
02:10:42.771 --> 02:10:44.210
<v Speaker 3>whether it's North Sentinel Island,</v>

5066
02:10:44.211 --> 02:10:46.880
<v Speaker 3>where that missionary was killed recently or the Amazon,</v>

5067
02:10:46.881 --> 02:10:50.090
<v Speaker 3>when they're going through these jungles and finding these small bands of</v>

5068
02:10:50.091 --> 02:10:50.924
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

5069
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:52.700
<v Speaker 3>they overwhelmingly,</v>

5070
02:10:52.701 --> 02:10:56.900
<v Speaker 3>everybody wants to back off and leave him alone and they are so close to us.</v>

5071
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:58.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean they are human beings.</v>

5072
02:10:58.041 --> 02:10:59.150
<v Speaker 3>They are Homo Sapiens,</v>

5073
02:10:59.151 --> 02:10:59.841
<v Speaker 3>they have tools,</v>

5074
02:10:59.841 --> 02:11:01.190
<v Speaker 3>they have civilization,</v>

5075
02:11:01.191 --> 02:11:01.881
<v Speaker 3>they have law,</v>

5076
02:11:01.881 --> 02:11:04.640
<v Speaker 3>they have all these different things that live in these communities.</v>

5077
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:05.570
<v Speaker 3>They're us.</v>

5078
02:11:05.570 --> 02:11:06.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5079
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:06.860
<v Speaker 3>And we back off,</v>

5080
02:11:07.070 --> 02:11:08.660
<v Speaker 3>imagine what aliens.</v>

5081
02:11:08.690 --> 02:11:10.310
<v Speaker 3>Imagine what aliens would do.</v>

5082
02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:11.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in an engine.</v>

5083
02:11:11.241 --> 02:11:11.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5084
02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:12.020
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

5085
02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:13.050
<v Speaker 3>That's their consciousness,</v>

5086
02:11:13.090 --> 02:11:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>

5087
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:16.670
<v Speaker 3>Cause they don't want it screws up the human flesh alternative.</v>

5088
02:11:16.730 --> 02:11:18.770
<v Speaker 3>That healthy human flesh alternative.</v>

5089
02:11:18.830 --> 02:11:19.663
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

5090
02:11:20.150 --> 02:11:20.983
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5091
02:11:21.910 --> 02:11:26.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a hoax from like all fortunate one who from Burger I'd be tobacco food,</v>

5092
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:29.630
<v Speaker 3>Burger Fried.</v>

5093
02:11:29.630 --> 02:11:29.781
<v Speaker 3>Who?</v>

5094
02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:30.614
<v Speaker 3>Food Burger.</v>

5095
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Once you see Tofu processed,</v>

5096
02:11:34.011 --> 02:11:34.400
<v Speaker 3>you let it go.</v>

5097
02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:35.233
<v Speaker 3>Oh this is,</v>

5098
02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:36.150
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

5099
02:11:36.150 --> 02:11:37.730
<v Speaker 3>is this really good for you?</v>

5100
02:11:37.731 --> 02:11:38.210
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

5101
02:11:38.210 --> 02:11:40.670
<v Speaker 3>This is so processed man.</v>

5102
02:11:40.730 --> 02:11:42.530
<v Speaker 3>So fucking slots,</v>

5103
02:11:42.531 --> 02:11:45.710
<v Speaker 3>like reduced to nothing that's and then formed again.</v>

5104
02:11:45.740 --> 02:11:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Can I just eat soybeans?</v>

5105
02:11:47.360 --> 02:11:48.860
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is this?</v>

5106
02:11:48.980 --> 02:11:52.370
<v Speaker 3>What you can do is you can buy a bag of frozen.</v>

5107
02:11:52.640 --> 02:11:53.510
<v Speaker 3>That's the way to go.</v>

5108
02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Don't fucking Tofu rose tasting toothpaste tube.</v>

5109
02:11:58.160 --> 02:11:59.480
<v Speaker 3>Well it tastes like nothing.</v>

5110
02:11:59.481 --> 02:11:59.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5111
02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's weird.</v>

5112
02:12:01.750 --> 02:12:03.020
<v Speaker 3>So weird choice.</v>

5113
02:12:03.200 --> 02:12:03.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5114
02:12:03.421 --> 02:12:03.741
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

5115
02:12:03.741 --> 02:12:04.220
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

5116
02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:04.371
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5117
02:12:04.371 --> 02:12:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I can't stand anything made from Tofu.</v>

5118
02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:08.660
<v Speaker 3>But I think that if aliens did see us there,</v>

5119
02:12:08.690 --> 02:12:12.410
<v Speaker 3>they would probably take a hands off approach if we weren't totally ruining</v>

5120
02:12:12.411 --> 02:12:13.244
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

5121
02:12:13.280 --> 02:12:15.570
<v Speaker 3>Like if we didn't have some anti matter weapons,</v>

5122
02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:20.780
<v Speaker 3>some black hole weapon that we're just going to just fucking nuke on New Mexico</v>

5123
02:12:20.781 --> 02:12:22.580
<v Speaker 3>just to see how it works happen.</v>

5124
02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:24.800
<v Speaker 3>And if they saw,</v>

5125
02:12:25.250 --> 02:12:28.070
<v Speaker 3>if they saw that it was going to burn a hole through the planet and kill</v>

5126
02:12:28.071 --> 02:12:28.790
<v Speaker 3>everything on,</v>

5127
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:33.790
<v Speaker 3>they might step in for a second before they launched cern glider and open up a</v>

5128
02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:41.360
<v Speaker 3>black hole that it will create a particle that would devour the fabric of the</v>

5129
02:12:41.361 --> 02:12:41.921
<v Speaker 3>university.</v>

5130
02:12:41.921 --> 02:12:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5131
02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:47.060
<v Speaker 3>It was a black hole that would expand and expand and expand and db did what we</v>

5132
02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:47.930
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

5133
02:12:47.930 --> 02:12:48.260
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

5134
02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:48.620
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

5135
02:12:48.620 --> 02:12:49.640
<v Speaker 3>maybe we restarted.</v>

5136
02:12:49.720 --> 02:12:50.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5137
02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:50.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5138
02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:51.950
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we were in a parallel universe.</v>

5139
02:12:53.720 --> 02:12:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we were knocked off our timeline into another place.</v>

5140
02:12:57.050 --> 02:12:58.220
<v Speaker 3>It makes less sense.</v>

5141
02:12:58.340 --> 02:12:58.551
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5142
02:12:58.551 --> 02:12:58.821
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

5143
02:12:58.821 --> 02:13:00.890
<v Speaker 3>It was the thing that was going around in the unit a little while.</v>

5144
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:04.490
<v Speaker 3>The evidence of multiple universities that we pop in and out of different</v>

5145
02:13:04.491 --> 02:13:04.990
<v Speaker 3>capacities.</v>

5146
02:13:04.990 --> 02:13:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5147
02:13:05.570 --> 02:13:06.650
<v Speaker 3>Like the fact that we,</v>

5148
02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:07.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a multiverse,</v>

5149
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:08.570
<v Speaker 3>the Ford logo,</v>

5150
02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:09.171
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

5151
02:13:09.171 --> 02:13:11.930
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember you recognize this part of the Ford logo and they see,</v>

5152
02:13:11.931 --> 02:13:13.990
<v Speaker 3>most people never noticed it.</v>

5153
02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird little squiggle in the AF.</v>

5154
02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:16.490
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

5155
02:13:16.490 --> 02:13:17.323
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5156
02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:20.210
<v Speaker 3>The Fedex thing blows people's minds to,</v>

5157
02:13:20.300 --> 02:13:21.133
<v Speaker 3>what's that?</v>

5158
02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:23.420
<v Speaker 3>The Arrow one arrow.</v>

5159
02:13:23.780 --> 02:13:24.613
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

5160
02:13:26.630 --> 02:13:27.560
<v Speaker 3>Bring ups Fedex.</v>

5161
02:13:27.650 --> 02:13:30.920
<v Speaker 3>If you'll never not see the Arrow again.</v>

5162
02:13:30.930 --> 02:13:31.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5163
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:32.640
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with the Ford logo.</v>

5164
02:13:32.850 --> 02:13:33.683
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's</v>

5165
02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:35.700
<v Speaker 3>perceptions.</v>

5166
02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:36.300
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5167
02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:36.930
<v Speaker 3>hmm.</v>

5168
02:13:36.930 --> 02:13:38.040
<v Speaker 3>And sit there the whole time.</v>

5169
02:13:38.041 --> 02:13:38.874
<v Speaker 3>And I did.</v>

5170
02:13:39.150 --> 02:13:40.580
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know there was an arrow there.</v>

5171
02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:45.120
<v Speaker 3>People will insist that the Fedex Arrow is really,</v>

5172
02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:45.391
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

5173
02:13:45.391 --> 02:13:46.110
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

5174
02:13:46.110 --> 02:13:46.411
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5175
02:13:46.411 --> 02:13:47.850
<v Speaker 3>But that's an accidental error.</v>

5176
02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:48.753
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5177
02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:50.610
<v Speaker 3>you think they designed it in there?</v>

5178
02:13:51.100 --> 02:13:51.933
<v Speaker 3>Where's there?</v>

5179
02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:53.550
<v Speaker 3>They definitely designed it right there.</v>

5180
02:13:53.551 --> 02:13:53.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5181
02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:54.773
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

5182
02:13:55.080 --> 02:13:55.913
<v Speaker 3>The white part.</v>

5183
02:13:56.370 --> 02:13:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Now not,</v>

5184
02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 3>you'll never see it again or never not see it again.</v>

5185
02:13:59.870 --> 02:14:00.190
<v Speaker 3>Know.</v>

5186
02:14:00.190 --> 02:14:00.730
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

5187
02:14:00.730 --> 02:14:01.563
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

5188
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:03.960
<v Speaker 3>But I mean that could be like four years before it.</v>

5189
02:14:03.961 --> 02:14:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5190
02:14:04.210 --> 02:14:06.790
<v Speaker 3>Was the four eagle little squiggle in the f Jews.</v>

5191
02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Why is that a squiggle?</v>

5192
02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:09.630
<v Speaker 3>Why is it that's ridiculous?</v>

5193
02:14:09.820 --> 02:14:11.360
<v Speaker 3>It actually makes an effort like that.</v>

5194
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:17.320
<v Speaker 3>It actually spells fjord or forward toward fool.</v>

5195
02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Is that an eye?</v>

5196
02:14:18.691 --> 02:14:19.524
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

5197
02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:20.670
<v Speaker 3>Why would they squeak a lot?</v>

5198
02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:21.513
<v Speaker 3>Did they do that?</v>

5199
02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5200
02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:22.110
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

5201
02:14:22.110 --> 02:14:24.220
<v Speaker 3>they didn't use to do that in return.</v>

5202
02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:27.950
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

5203
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:28.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5204
02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:29.670
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

5205
02:14:29.670 --> 02:14:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5206
02:14:29.810 --> 02:14:33.810
<v Speaker 3>The people who insist that it died in jail.</v>

5207
02:14:33.811 --> 02:14:34.644
<v Speaker 3>In jail.</v>

5208
02:14:34.710 --> 02:14:36.870
<v Speaker 3>So was there always a squiggle?</v>

5209
02:14:36.871 --> 02:14:37.470
<v Speaker 3>When did,</v>

5210
02:14:37.470 --> 02:14:38.191
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

5211
02:14:38.191 --> 02:14:39.690
<v Speaker 3>Is that a real forward,</v>

5212
02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:40.553
<v Speaker 3>that little thing?</v>

5213
02:14:41.340 --> 02:14:42.780
<v Speaker 3>When did they make the squiggle?</v>

5214
02:14:43.230 --> 02:14:43.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5215
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:46.950
<v Speaker 3>That's normal because that's what I thought the Ford thing looked like until I</v>

5216
02:14:46.951 --> 02:14:49.440
<v Speaker 3>saw this maybe in a future that they stopped the squiggle.</v>

5217
02:14:49.441 --> 02:14:51.690
<v Speaker 3>At some point they must have more the opposite.</v>

5218
02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they add the squiggle,</v>

5219
02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:54.960
<v Speaker 3>bring up the squiggle without some on.</v>

5220
02:14:54.961 --> 02:14:56.280
<v Speaker 3>Or did you do the research?</v>

5221
02:14:56.330 --> 02:15:01.330
<v Speaker 3>What's a modern forward go to a 2019 Ford Mustang.</v>

5222
02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:03.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's see that.</v>

5223
02:15:04.110 --> 02:15:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Let's see if they'd have the squiggles.</v>

5224
02:15:05.431 --> 02:15:05.881
<v Speaker 3>A squiggle.</v>

5225
02:15:05.881 --> 02:15:07.290
<v Speaker 3>Now it does.</v>

5226
02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:11.550
<v Speaker 3>I think maybe some the squiggle asshole wanted to justify his existence by</v>

5227
02:15:11.551 --> 02:15:13.640
<v Speaker 3>ruining their beautiful logo.</v>

5228
02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:14.713
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5229
02:15:14.910 --> 02:15:15.743
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5230
02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:16.320
<v Speaker 3>well good.</v>

5231
02:15:16.320 --> 02:15:16.711
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

5232
02:15:16.711 --> 02:15:19.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean the logos do chain that does the squiggle squiggle.</v>

5233
02:15:20.080 --> 02:15:20.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5234
02:15:20.730 --> 02:15:21.750
<v Speaker 3>That's a new Mustang.</v>

5235
02:15:21.751 --> 02:15:22.980
<v Speaker 3>So the squiggle is a current,</v>

5236
02:15:23.790 --> 02:15:24.420
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

5237
02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:24.780
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

5238
02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:25.650
<v Speaker 3>The squiggles current.</v>

5239
02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:27.030
<v Speaker 3>It really doesn't fit.</v>

5240
02:15:27.330 --> 02:15:27.510
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5241
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:28.343
<v Speaker 3>it looks stupid.</v>

5242
02:15:28.850 --> 02:15:30.260
<v Speaker 3>It would look better without that stupid scores.</v>

5243
02:15:30.670 --> 02:15:31.471
<v Speaker 3>The only thing that's saving,</v>

5244
02:15:31.471 --> 02:15:31.771
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

5245
02:15:31.771 --> 02:15:32.101
<v Speaker 3>Squiggles it.</v>

5246
02:15:32.101 --> 02:15:33.480
<v Speaker 3>No one noticed it up until now.</v>

5247
02:15:33.850 --> 02:15:35.070
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm never an academic notice.</v>

5248
02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:36.540
<v Speaker 3>The Mandela effect,</v>

5249
02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:38.310
<v Speaker 3>I hate Mandela effect,</v>

5250
02:15:38.550 --> 02:15:41.850
<v Speaker 3>but that just seems like people fucking with something.</v>

5251
02:15:41.851 --> 02:15:42.684
<v Speaker 3>That's not broken.</v>

5252
02:15:43.140 --> 02:15:43.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5253
02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:44.370
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5254
02:15:44.370 --> 02:15:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5255
02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:46.040
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5256
02:15:46.110 --> 02:15:46.351
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

5257
02:15:46.351 --> 02:15:47.850
<v Speaker 3>let's just remember when they showed up,</v>

5258
02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:48.241
<v Speaker 3>reg.</v>

5259
02:15:48.241 --> 02:15:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Remember when they came up with a new coke?</v>

5260
02:15:50.130 --> 02:15:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Fuck God was up like a riot riot on their head and sort of a parallel universe.</v>

5261
02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:55.860
<v Speaker 3>It's just a stupid idea.</v>

5262
02:15:56.280 --> 02:15:57.330
<v Speaker 3>He just ruined coke.</v>

5263
02:15:58.200 --> 02:15:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Coke's made with real cocaine.</v>

5264
02:15:59.910 --> 02:16:00.743
<v Speaker 3>The original coke.</v>

5265
02:16:00.750 --> 02:16:01.021
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5266
02:16:01.021 --> 02:16:01.201
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5267
02:16:01.201 --> 02:16:01.680
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

5268
02:16:01.680 --> 02:16:02.131
<v Speaker 3>Today.</v>

5269
02:16:02.131 --> 02:16:02.551
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5270
02:16:02.551 --> 02:16:03.384
<v Speaker 3>I thought they,</v>

5271
02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:04.500
<v Speaker 3>they replaced it with caffeine.</v>

5272
02:16:04.530 --> 02:16:04.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5273
02:16:04.710 --> 02:16:05.760
<v Speaker 3>they use cocoa leaves.</v>

5274
02:16:05.810 --> 02:16:06.481
<v Speaker 3>Smacking the thesis.</v>

5275
02:16:06.481 --> 02:16:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Coca leaves for flavor.</v>

5276
02:16:07.651 --> 02:16:08.101
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5277
02:16:08.101 --> 02:16:08.731
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

5278
02:16:08.731 --> 02:16:09.564
<v Speaker 3>the company,</v>

5279
02:16:09.630 --> 02:16:09.961
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

5280
02:16:09.961 --> 02:16:10.890
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

5281
02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:13.740
<v Speaker 3>The company that makes the coke,</v>

5282
02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:17.850
<v Speaker 3>the company that uses the coca leaves that brings in the coca leaves to make</v>

5283
02:16:17.851 --> 02:16:22.320
<v Speaker 3>Coca Cola is the number one creator of medical grade cocaine.</v>

5284
02:16:22.800 --> 02:16:26.850
<v Speaker 3>They use that coca leave to also make medical grade cocaine.</v>

5285
02:16:26.851 --> 02:16:29.160
<v Speaker 3>There's no cocaine in Coca Cola,</v>

5286
02:16:29.170 --> 02:16:30.250
<v Speaker 3>but there is a flavor</v>

5287
02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:32.680
<v Speaker 4>that's a bunch of different four logos.</v>

5288
02:16:32.910 --> 02:16:33.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5289
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.860
<v Speaker 4>Over the years.</v>

5290
02:16:33.860 --> 02:16:34.030
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

5291
02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.800
<v Speaker 4>I just drink.</v>

5292
02:16:34.800 --> 02:16:35.620
<v Speaker 4>I drink diet coke.</v>

5293
02:16:35.620 --> 02:16:39.670
<v Speaker 4>Would you 1927 to 2003.</v>

5294
02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:40.220
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

5295
02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:40.770
<v Speaker 4>All of them,</v>

5296
02:16:40.770 --> 02:16:41.603
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

5297
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:42.160
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

5298
02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:43.510
<v Speaker 4>I like the one in 1903.</v>

5299
02:16:43.511 --> 02:16:44.500
<v Speaker 4>That's actually a pretty dope.</v>

5300
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.870
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5301
02:16:46.870 --> 02:16:48.730
<v Speaker 4>Google coke.</v>

5302
02:16:48.760 --> 02:16:51.940
<v Speaker 4>They use coca leaves to make Coca Cola.</v>

5303
02:16:51.970 --> 02:16:53.040
<v Speaker 4>They still do it.</v>

5304
02:16:53.041 --> 02:16:53.711
<v Speaker 4>Actually do.</v>

5305
02:16:53.711 --> 02:16:58.030
<v Speaker 4>And then the company does that because it makes cocaine because the,</v>

5306
02:16:58.230 --> 02:17:00.530
<v Speaker 4>yeah cause the recipe for herbal.</v>

5307
02:17:00.670 --> 02:17:02.410
<v Speaker 4>There's like a lot of herbs that go into coke.</v>

5308
02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:04.390
<v Speaker 4>Yes it's a flavor.</v>

5309
02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:06.760
<v Speaker 4>But the Diet coke is just chemicals.</v>

5310
02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:08.111
<v Speaker 4>It's all artificial.</v>

5311
02:17:08.111 --> 02:17:10.670
<v Speaker 4>I remember I was in school when the new coke thing happened and then he'll get</v>

5312
02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:14.880
<v Speaker 4>this advertising besides producing the cocoa flavor agent for Coca Cola.</v>

5313
02:17:14.881 --> 02:17:18.460
<v Speaker 4>The Stephan company extracts cocaine from the coca leaves which sells it to</v>

5314
02:17:18.890 --> 02:17:20.310
<v Speaker 4>Mallon crock.</v>

5315
02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:24.040
<v Speaker 4>A Saint Louis Missouri pharmaceutical manufacturer that is the only company in</v>

5316
02:17:24.041 --> 02:17:27.490
<v Speaker 4>the United States licensed to purify cocaine from medical use.</v>

5317
02:17:27.870 --> 02:17:28.780
<v Speaker 4>But I'll use,</v>

5318
02:17:29.980 --> 02:17:30.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5319
02:17:30.460 --> 02:17:31.060
<v Speaker 4>there you go.</v>

5320
02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:33.490
<v Speaker 4>So they're actually using actual coca leaves.</v>

5321
02:17:33.491 --> 02:17:34.324
<v Speaker 4>So someone,</v>

5322
02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:37.000
<v Speaker 4>I guarantee you if you follow the paperwork,</v>

5323
02:17:37.001 --> 02:17:38.920
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of cocaine hanging around guys,</v>

5324
02:17:38.921 --> 02:17:39.490
<v Speaker 4>additives,</v>

5325
02:17:39.490 --> 02:17:40.300
<v Speaker 4>residual.</v>

5326
02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:40.901
<v Speaker 4>Those guys,</v>

5327
02:17:40.901 --> 02:17:41.830
<v Speaker 4>they get a little bit here,</v>

5328
02:17:43.500 --> 02:17:44.500
<v Speaker 4>gives you a little pep me up.</v>

5329
02:17:44.540 --> 02:17:45.100
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

5330
02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:47.770
<v Speaker 4>That's what's amazing is that you're not allowed to chew the leaves cause</v>

5331
02:17:47.771 --> 02:17:49.690
<v Speaker 4>apparently chewing the leaves is really healthy.</v>

5332
02:17:50.170 --> 02:17:51.340
<v Speaker 4>You get flavonoids,</v>

5333
02:17:51.341 --> 02:17:52.870
<v Speaker 4>it's actually good for you.</v>

5334
02:17:52.871 --> 02:17:55.990
<v Speaker 4>And it gives you a pickup that's very similar to caffeine.</v>

5335
02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:56.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5336
02:17:56.560 --> 02:18:00.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's why people living in those forests been chewing them.</v>

5337
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.780
<v Speaker 4>What's this chain?</v>

5338
02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:08.740
<v Speaker 4>I just one of those weird things that pops up when you see a 90% of their sales</v>

5339
02:18:08.741 --> 02:18:08.981
<v Speaker 4>are done,</v>

5340
02:18:08.981 --> 02:18:09.611
<v Speaker 4>the United States,</v>

5341
02:18:09.611 --> 02:18:11.530
<v Speaker 4>but it's an Irish tax registered manufacturer.</v>

5342
02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

02:18:18.371 --> 02:18:20.110
<v Speaker 4>Tax Weasel moves.</v>

02:18:21.850 --> 02:18:22.900
<v Speaker 4>Taxes.</v>

5349
02:18:23.490 --> 02:18:28.120
<v Speaker 4>That's it bizarre when you find out this giant corporations that make billions</v>

5350
02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:28.121
<v Speaker 4>of dollars,</v>

5351
02:18:28.121 --> 02:18:30.790
<v Speaker 4>if they're all in Ireland and the weasel out of taxes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

5353
02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:32.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5354
02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:34.870
<v Speaker 4>How much did I say they don't believe in socialism?</v>

5355
02:18:34.930 --> 02:18:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Did you read that at many taxes I paid last year.</v>

5356
02:18:37.031 --> 02:18:38.550
<v Speaker 4>Amazon zero.</v>

5357
02:18:38.670 --> 02:18:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>

5358
02:18:39.490 --> 02:18:40.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5359
02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:41.013
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5360
02:18:41.200 --> 02:18:43.630
<v Speaker 4>it's nice that it exists and you know,</v>

5361
02:18:43.631 --> 02:18:46.050
<v Speaker 4>you get a one click and you have some toilet paper said Tom,</v>

5362
02:18:46.590 --> 02:18:48.190
<v Speaker 4>I'm happy to use their product.</v>

5363
02:18:48.250 --> 02:18:49.450
<v Speaker 4>And that's why they need,</v>

5364
02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:53.830
<v Speaker 4>that's why they needed $1 billion in tax breaks from the city of New York.</v>

5365
02:18:53.890 --> 02:18:55.020
<v Speaker 4>How does that work?</v>

5366
02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:56.100
<v Speaker 4>How does that work?</v>

5367
02:18:56.400 --> 02:18:57.850
<v Speaker 4>You could pay zero in taxes.</v>

5368
02:18:57.851 --> 02:18:58.510
<v Speaker 4>Zero.</v>

5369
02:18:58.510 --> 02:18:59.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5370
02:18:59.140 --> 02:19:01.060
<v Speaker 4>And why did they need those tax breaks in Long Island?</v>

5371
02:19:01.090 --> 02:19:04.450
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's why I feel like you fucking dummies.</v>

5372
02:19:04.451 --> 02:19:06.910
<v Speaker 4>You let Amazon fuck you over like that.</v>

5373
02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:09.100
<v Speaker 4>Or maybe that's why they're coming here.</v>

5374
02:19:09.101 --> 02:19:10.170
<v Speaker 4>All their money's in Ireland.</v>

5375
02:19:11.610 --> 02:19:12.730
<v Speaker 4>Ireland's doing great.</v>

5400
02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:56.930

02:19:56.960 --> 02:19:57.470

5408
02:20:00.201 --> 02:20:01.280
<v Speaker 2>I used to drink quite a bit.</v>

5409

02:20:04.190 --> 02:20:05.480
<v Speaker 2>now I do one night,</v>

5414
02:20:05.481 --> 02:20:06.590
<v Speaker 2>about four years ago,</v>

5415
02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:07.311
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5416

5417
02:20:10.830 --> 02:20:11.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5418
02:20:11.420 --> 02:20:11.810
<v Speaker 2>wound up,</v>

5419
02:20:11.810 --> 02:20:14.270
<v Speaker 2>I guess at a bar called the must downtown,</v>

5420
02:20:14.271 --> 02:20:15.500
<v Speaker 2>right around the corner from my apartment.</v>

5421
02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:18.470
<v Speaker 2>And I fell down on the patio,</v>

5422
02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:20.090
<v Speaker 2>just fell over like that.</v>

5423
02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:21.373
<v Speaker 2>I would call it our,</v>

5424
02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I would call it a dead fall backwards and landed back God and hit my head on</v>

5425
02:20:26.991 --> 02:20:27.350
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5426
02:20:27.350 --> 02:20:32.350
<v Speaker 2>on the stone patio with enough force that my brain gave me a black eye from the</v>

5427
02:20:32.511 --> 02:20:33.860
<v Speaker 2>inside of my head.</v>

5428
02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:35.150
<v Speaker 2>It's called cerebral hemorrhage,</v>

5429
02:20:35.151 --> 02:20:35.781
<v Speaker 2>chipping away at night.</v>

5430
02:20:35.781 --> 02:20:37.100
<v Speaker 2>I had a subdural Hematoma.</v>

5431
02:20:37.490 --> 02:20:39.500
<v Speaker 2>I was in the ICU for four days.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Can you just like total recall?</v>

5446
02:20:55.830 --> 02:20:57.170

5447
02:20:57.171 --> 02:20:59.090
<v Speaker 2>but Chrissy know Chrissy has the photos of all that.</v>

5448
02:20:59.120 --> 02:20:59.953
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5449
02:21:00.140 --> 02:21:00.441
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

5450
02:21:00.441 --> 02:21:01.430
<v Speaker 2>but the weird thing was,</v>

5451
02:21:01.760 --> 02:21:02.593
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5452
02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:03.720
<v Speaker 2>and then I decided I was all right,</v>

5453
02:21:03.721 --> 02:21:04.070
<v Speaker 2>what do I said?</v>

5454
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.221
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

5455
02:21:04.221 --> 02:21:05.054
<v Speaker 2>I got to quit drinking.</v>

5456
02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:06.090
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>

5457
02:21:06.090 --> 02:21:06.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5458
02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:06.921
<v Speaker 2>it'd be hard,</v>

5459
02:21:06.921 --> 02:21:07.670
<v Speaker 2>but I'll do it.</v>

5460
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:08.530
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5461
02:21:09.010 --> 02:21:13.400
<v Speaker 2>and I kept waiting for it to get hard to not drink and it never did.</v>

5462
02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not four years.</v>

5463
02:21:14.781 --> 02:21:15.950
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had a drink at four years.</v>

5464
02:21:16.470 --> 02:21:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5465
02:21:16.950 --> 02:21:17.783
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

5466
02:21:17.810 --> 02:21:18.410
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>

5467
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:19.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5468
02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:20.390
<v Speaker 2>But don't do anything.</v>

5469
02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

5470
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:21.700
<v Speaker 2>No Pot.</v>

5471
02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:22.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

5472
02:21:22.110 --> 02:21:22.340
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5473
02:21:22.340 --> 02:21:22.580
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

5474
02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:23.181
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could.</v>

5475
02:21:23.181 --> 02:21:23.870
<v Speaker 2>I don't like pot.</v>

5476
02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:24.703
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could enjoy it.</v>

5477
02:21:24.800 --> 02:21:25.633
<v Speaker 2>Don't you like about it?</v>

5478
02:21:25.730 --> 02:21:27.710
<v Speaker 2>And it makes me very quiet and paranoid.</v>

5479
02:21:27.711 --> 02:21:28.544
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite part.</v>

5480
02:21:30.290 --> 02:21:32.160
<v Speaker 2>And I like about it.</v>

5481
02:21:33.350 --> 02:21:35.050
<v Speaker 2>But you seem very lucid when you're on pot.</v>

5482
02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:37.310
<v Speaker 2>It seemed very and very communicative.</v>

5483
02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5484
02:21:38.030 --> 02:21:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Whereas when I had smoked pot,</v>

5485
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:40.370
<v Speaker 2>I can't put a sentence together.</v>

5486
02:21:40.390 --> 02:21:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5487
02:21:40.640 --> 02:21:41.473
<v Speaker 2>it must be friendly.</v>

5488
02:21:41.640 --> 02:21:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5489
02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:43.400
<v Speaker 2>It makes me very withdrawn.</v>

5490
02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:44.990
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol makes me friendly.</v>

5491
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:46.480
<v Speaker 2>So what that for me too.</v>

5492
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5493
02:21:46.651 --> 02:21:49.610
<v Speaker 2>We say the one thing I miss about drinking is the liking people</v>

5494
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:52.870
<v Speaker 2>like me more than,</v>

5495
02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:53.713
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5496
02:21:54.890 --> 02:21:55.340
<v Speaker 2>But I have,</v>

5497
02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:56.390
<v Speaker 2>because of this brain injury,</v>

5498
02:21:56.490 --> 02:21:59.450
<v Speaker 2>it never was hard to not drink.</v>

5499
02:21:59.451 --> 02:21:59.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

5500
02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:02.540
<v Speaker 2>my urge to drink was gone from getting knocked in the head.</v>

5501
02:22:02.541 --> 02:22:02.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5502
02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

5503
02:22:03.260 --> 02:22:05.960
<v Speaker 2>And also I noticed over the couple of years is it,</v>

5504
02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:07.460
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had any depression.</v>

5505
02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:08.390
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

5506
02:22:08.390 --> 02:22:09.051
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

5507
02:22:09.051 --> 02:22:09.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5508
02:22:09.820 --> 02:22:10.330
<v Speaker 2>just before,</v>

5509
02:22:10.330 --> 02:22:11.870
<v Speaker 2>I guess in like November,</v>

5510
02:22:11.871 --> 02:22:12.230
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

5511
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:13.030
<v Speaker 2>I talked to my doctors,</v>

5512
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:15.350
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to go off the antidepressants and see what happens.</v>

5513
02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:17.000
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

5514
02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:20.390
<v Speaker 2>so I've been like gradually weaned off and just this month took like the last</v>

5515
02:22:20.390 --> 02:22:21.650
<v Speaker 2>day antidepressants for about a month ago.</v>

5516
02:22:21.860 --> 02:22:23.870
<v Speaker 2>So how long has the weaning process,</v>

5517
02:22:23.950 --> 02:22:25.850
<v Speaker 2>it's like about three months and node.</v>

5518
02:22:26.090 --> 02:22:27.240
<v Speaker 3>How do you really addictive?</v>

5519
02:22:27.300 --> 02:22:28.133
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5520
02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:28.920
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5521
02:22:28.920 --> 02:22:30.570
<v Speaker 3>And how do you do it when you're weaning?</v>

5522
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:33.330
<v Speaker 3>It's just gradually reducing the dosage,</v>

5523
02:22:33.360 --> 02:22:34.320
<v Speaker 3>the daily dosage,</v>

5524
02:22:34.321 --> 02:22:38.010
<v Speaker 3>and then doing it every other day and then it's gone.</v>

5525
02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:39.090
<v Speaker 3>But they have a protocol.</v>

5526
02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5527
02:22:39.660 --> 02:22:40.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5528
02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:42.030
<v Speaker 3>And so did he discourage,</v>

5529
02:22:42.031 --> 02:22:43.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5532
02:22:44.731 --> 02:22:44.891

02:22:46.981 --> 02:22:47.251

02:22:47.251 --> 02:22:47.820

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5544
02:22:51.510 --> 02:22:52.343
<v Speaker 3>I guess so.</v>

5545
02:22:52.450 --> 02:22:54.510
<v Speaker 3>He had to think he had a reflector on his head.</v>

5546
02:22:54.570 --> 02:22:55.403
<v Speaker 3>That's all you need,</v>

5547
02:22:55.490 --> 02:22:57.150
<v Speaker 3>a lab coat.</v>

5548
02:22:57.240 --> 02:22:57.900
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>

5549
02:22:57.900 --> 02:22:58.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5550
02:22:58.290 --> 02:22:59.010
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>

5551
02:22:59.010 --> 02:23:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I think he lives in the neighborhood.</v>

5552
02:23:00.211 --> 02:23:01.560
<v Speaker 3>He's always walking around outside.</v>

5553
02:23:01.730 --> 02:23:02.490
<v Speaker 3>That's him.</v>

5554
02:23:02.490 --> 02:23:03.150
<v Speaker 3>That's a doctor.</v>

5555
02:23:03.150 --> 02:23:04.920
<v Speaker 3>So we did it.</v>

5556
02:23:04.921 --> 02:23:05.570
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

5557
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:06.750
<v Speaker 3>and so now I'm about a month,</v>

5558
02:23:07.370 --> 02:23:09.440
<v Speaker 3>about a month in without any antidepressants.</v>

5559
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:11.520
<v Speaker 3>What is the difference?</v>

5560
02:23:12.180 --> 02:23:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5561
02:23:13.800 --> 02:23:14.790

5562
02:23:14.791 --> 02:23:15.451
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's hard.</v>

5563
02:23:15.451 --> 02:23:16.500
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel different age.</v>

5568
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5576
02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:31.573
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>definitely more.</v>

5578
02:23:32.611 --> 02:23:33.630
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm more emotional.</v>

5579
02:23:34.330 --> 02:23:35.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5580
02:23:35.160 --> 02:23:36.390

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5585
02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:42.000
<v Speaker 3>hopefully I'm part of it.</v>

5586
02:23:42.001 --> 02:23:42.301
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking,</v>

5587
02:23:42.301 --> 02:23:44.670
<v Speaker 3>I hope it will help with writing cause I felt like I was having trouble coming</v>

5588
02:23:44.671 --> 02:23:45.540
<v Speaker 3>up with story ideas.</v>

5589
02:23:47.100 --> 02:23:48.750
<v Speaker 3>You do hug me too long now.</v>

5590
02:23:49.950 --> 02:23:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5591
02:23:50.340 --> 02:23:50.561
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5592
02:23:50.561 --> 02:23:51.720
<v Speaker 3>I'll always become a predator.</v>

5593
02:23:54.690 --> 02:23:55.523
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

5594
02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.330
<v Speaker 3>But I feel good about it.</v>

5595
02:23:57.420 --> 02:23:58.253
<v Speaker 3>The important thing.</v>

5596
02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:03.270
<v Speaker 3>So the only thing is emotions and you feel more creative,</v>

5597
02:24:03.271 --> 02:24:04.200
<v Speaker 3>you feel more in touch.</v>

5598
02:24:04.201 --> 02:24:04.920
<v Speaker 3>You don't know yet.</v>

5599
02:24:04.920 --> 02:24:05.341
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5600
02:24:05.341 --> 02:24:06.270
<v Speaker 3>And I don't even know if I feel,</v>

5601
02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:06.751
<v Speaker 3>I just know,</v>

5602
02:24:06.751 --> 02:24:08.550
<v Speaker 3>I definitely know that there's a,</v>

5603
02:24:09.750 --> 02:24:11.610
<v Speaker 3>there's a heightened emotionalism.</v>

5604
02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:14.590
<v Speaker 3>Has it affected your him provides us a little while at,</v>

5605
02:24:14.640 --> 02:24:15.473
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem to happen.</v>

5606
02:24:15.490 --> 02:24:16.350
<v Speaker 3>I was worried it would,</v>

5607
02:24:16.351 --> 02:24:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I was worried that I would be like,</v>

5608
02:24:19.380 --> 02:24:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I might not be able to go out and do those shows cause that'd be more,</v>

5609
02:24:22.270 --> 02:24:24.120
<v Speaker 3>I was worried it might be more moody and you know,</v>

5610
02:24:24.860 --> 02:24:25.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5611
02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:26.273
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5612
02:24:26.520 --> 02:24:29.100
<v Speaker 3>But it's so far it hasn't affected them.</v>

5613
02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:30.473
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

5614
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:33.690
<v Speaker 3>cause I went on them and news radio cause I couldn't work at one point.</v>

5615
02:24:33.691 --> 02:24:34.201
<v Speaker 3>I got to the point,</v>

5616
02:24:34.201 --> 02:24:34.321
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5617
02:24:34.321 --> 02:24:35.340
<v Speaker 3>It's couldn't work anymore.</v>

5618
02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:38.760
<v Speaker 3>And that's when I started going on anti depressants and it saved me,</v>

5619
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:39.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5620
02:24:39.210 --> 02:24:41.010
<v Speaker 3>so totally believe that people should get,</v>

5621
02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:42.660
<v Speaker 3>get on meds and stay on them.</v>

5622
02:24:42.810 --> 02:24:43.643
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5623
02:24:43.710 --> 02:24:44.011
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

5624
02:24:44.011 --> 02:24:45.330
<v Speaker 3>it definitely helps some people.</v>

5625
02:24:45.331 --> 02:24:47.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean it saved a couple of my friends for sure.</v>

5626
02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:48.060
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5627
02:24:48.060 --> 02:24:51.740
<v Speaker 3>There were suicidal and just really didn't know where to turn.</v>

5628
02:24:51.760 --> 02:24:54.870
<v Speaker 3>They got on the right ones and they had experiment.</v>

5629
02:24:55.290 --> 02:24:57.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I would've made it through the,</v>

5630
02:24:57.720 --> 02:24:58.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5631
02:24:58.080 --> 02:24:58.980
<v Speaker 3>the 2000.</v>

5632
02:24:59.630 --> 02:25:00.463
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5633
02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:01.120
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

5634
02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:04.170
<v Speaker 3>like we just lost Brody Stevens just died.</v>

5635
02:25:04.420 --> 02:25:04.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5636
02:25:04.650 --> 02:25:05.840
<v Speaker 3>He got off his meds.</v>

5637
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:06.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5638
02:25:06.450 --> 02:25:06.781
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

5639
02:25:06.781 --> 02:25:07.200
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5640
02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:07.570
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

5641
02:25:07.570 --> 02:25:10.640
<v Speaker 3>he didn't like the way it felt to be on them and you know,</v>

5642
02:25:10.730 --> 02:25:12.390
<v Speaker 3>so he's so hard.</v>

5643
02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:16.620
<v Speaker 3>That's such a hard one to take because everyone loved that guy.</v>

5644
02:25:16.621 --> 02:25:18.360
<v Speaker 3>And to think that everyone,</v>

5645
02:25:18.390 --> 02:25:18.571
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5646
02:25:18.571 --> 02:25:20.100
<v Speaker 3>he has no haters.</v>

5647
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:21.001
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

5648
02:25:21.001 --> 02:25:22.290
<v Speaker 3>A single person was like,</v>

5649
02:25:22.291 --> 02:25:23.190
<v Speaker 3>that guy was a dick.</v>

5650
02:25:23.350 --> 02:25:23.790
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5651
02:25:23.790 --> 02:25:23.941
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5652
02:25:23.941 --> 02:25:24.071
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5653
02:25:24.071 --> 02:25:24.161
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5654
02:25:24.161 --> 02:25:24.450
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

5655
02:25:24.450 --> 02:25:25.030
<v Speaker 3>no one.</v>

5656
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.841
<v Speaker 3>Everyone loved him.</v>

5657
02:25:25.841 --> 02:25:28.190
<v Speaker 3>And it hit everybody really hard from close friends to people.</v>

5658
02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:29.140
<v Speaker 3>Just knew him a little bit.</v>

5659
02:25:29.141 --> 02:25:30.370
<v Speaker 3>Like I knew him just a little bit.</v>

5660
02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:31.750
<v Speaker 3>He was so sweet,</v>

5661
02:25:31.751 --> 02:25:33.070
<v Speaker 3>but he was so,</v>

5662
02:25:33.310 --> 02:25:34.930
<v Speaker 3>so tortured.</v>

5663
02:25:34.931 --> 02:25:36.580
<v Speaker 3>He was just in pain all the time.</v>

5664
02:25:36.581 --> 02:25:37.414
<v Speaker 3>And yeah,</v>

5665
02:25:37.630 --> 02:25:38.463
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

5666
02:25:38.470 --> 02:25:43.330
<v Speaker 3>it's so strange that you think the thing that people like most is for other</v>

5667
02:25:43.331 --> 02:25:45.280
<v Speaker 3>people to love them and care about them.</v>

5668
02:25:45.281 --> 02:25:46.420
<v Speaker 3>And everybody loves Brody.</v>

5669
02:25:46.620 --> 02:25:47.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5670
02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:48.430
<v Speaker 3>But yet he couldn't,</v>

5671
02:25:48.870 --> 02:25:50.200
<v Speaker 3>it just couldn't go on.</v>

5672
02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:51.160
<v Speaker 3>But I never,</v>

5673
02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:53.860
<v Speaker 3>I've never known Brodie to have a relationship.</v>

5674
02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:56.950
<v Speaker 3>I've never known him to have a special someone in his life.</v>

5675
02:25:56.950 --> 02:25:57.631
<v Speaker 3>And I mean that,</v>

5676
02:25:57.631 --> 02:26:00.760
<v Speaker 3>that alone probably be very,</v>

5677
02:26:00.761 --> 02:26:01.850
<v Speaker 3>very depressed.</v>

5678
02:26:02.050 --> 02:26:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Well especially if,</v>

5679
02:26:03.180 --> 02:26:05.770
<v Speaker 3>if everyone loves you but you don't feel connected to any of them.</v>

5680
02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5681
02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Like how empty that rails and that's the core of depression name.</v>

5682
02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:11.923
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5683
02:26:12.190 --> 02:26:15.100
<v Speaker 3>But it's also the core of depression I had having had depression.</v>

5684
02:26:15.700 --> 02:26:19.780
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that hits you is that feeling that you just can't connect and</v>

5685
02:26:19.781 --> 02:26:20.141
<v Speaker 3>does it,</v>

5686
02:26:20.141 --> 02:26:23.170
<v Speaker 3>was yours coming about when your first marriage was breaking up?</v>

5687
02:26:23.500 --> 02:26:28.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean I had lifelong depression but I didn't get it treated until that point</v>

5688
02:26:28.450 --> 02:26:29.283
<v Speaker 3>when it was like,</v>

5689
02:26:29.380 --> 02:26:29.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5690
02:26:29.591 --> 02:26:30.424
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

5691
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:31.300
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5692
02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:34.990
<v Speaker 3>yeah cause of the marriage was breaking up and I had to fly to Africa twice in a</v>

5693
02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:36.100
<v Speaker 3>month to see my kids.</v>

5694
02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:39.730
<v Speaker 3>And you remember the time that like a protected a reporter from you?</v>

5695
02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I'll let the TCA,</v>

5696
02:26:41.890 --> 02:26:42.640
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

5697

5698
02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:46.370

5744
02:27:39.870 --> 02:27:43.630
<v Speaker 3>that I just went on antidepressants because I crashed really hard after that.</v>

5745
02:27:44.350 --> 02:27:45.280
<v Speaker 3>And it was like one the things about that.</v>

5746
02:27:45.310 --> 02:27:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I said you could go to work,</v>

5749
02:27:51.791 --> 02:27:53.910
<v Speaker 3>alcohol is like a crazy combination.</v>

5750
02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:58.910
<v Speaker 3>And then you got to that jet lag and the trauma of being separated from my kids.</v>

5751
02:27:59.840 --> 02:28:01.090
<v Speaker 3>The malaria pills on their own.</v>

02:28:19.511 --> 02:28:20.710

02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:21.703
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5765

<v Speaker 3>In the year you can just write them off.</v>

5774

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5776
02:28:32.330 --> 02:28:33.810
<v Speaker 3>Next year he's going to call it.</v>

5777
02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:35.300
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>

5778
02:28:35.300 --> 02:28:36.410
<v Speaker 3>if you are out there,</v>

5779
02:28:37.290 --> 02:28:37.970
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

5780
02:28:37.970 --> 02:28:39.190
<v Speaker 3>Get on meds and stay on them.</v>

5781
02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:39.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5782
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Like Brody should have stayed on his meds.</v>

5783
02:28:41.120 --> 02:28:41.570
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5784
02:28:41.570 --> 02:28:42.051
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5785
02:28:42.051 --> 02:28:42.884
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

5786
02:28:43.260 --> 02:28:48.260
<v Speaker 3>I wish we could have all known and how he was and how close he was to that.</v>

5787
02:28:48.770 --> 02:28:49.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5788
02:28:49.131 --> 02:28:49.850
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the thing.</v>

5789
02:28:49.850 --> 02:28:50.211
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

5790
02:28:50.211 --> 02:28:51.320
<v Speaker 3>people think like,</v>

5791
02:28:51.710 --> 02:28:52.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5792
02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:56.030
<v Speaker 3>like suicide things that if you're close to suicide,</v>

5793
02:28:56.031 --> 02:28:59.900
<v Speaker 3>it's the most rational choice you'll ever make when you're,</v>

5794
02:28:59.930 --> 02:29:00.950
<v Speaker 3>when you're that close.</v>

5795
02:29:01.310 --> 02:29:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

5796
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:05.030
<v Speaker 3>It just seems like the most sensible way to the issue this because it's</v>

5797
02:29:05.031 --> 02:29:06.260
<v Speaker 3>otherwise it's too much pain.</v>

5798
02:29:06.290 --> 02:29:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5799
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:08.420
<v Speaker 3>I heard someone describe it as,</v>

5800
02:29:08.421 --> 02:29:08.930
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5801
02:29:08.930 --> 02:29:10.760
<v Speaker 3>it's not even on a commercial decision burning.</v>

5802
02:29:10.761 --> 02:29:12.200
<v Speaker 3>It's jumping out of a burning building.</v>

5803
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:16.430
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's that choice into the burning building or,</v>

5804
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:17.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5805
02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:18.170
<v Speaker 3>What's that feeling right where you go,</v>

5806
02:29:18.171 --> 02:29:19.610
<v Speaker 3>this is not an emotional decision.</v>

5807
02:29:19.611 --> 02:29:19.761
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5808
02:29:19.761 --> 02:29:20.594
<v Speaker 3>there's no choice.</v>

5809
02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:22.910
<v Speaker 3>I've had two friends hang themselves this year.</v>

5810
02:29:23.060 --> 02:29:23.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5811
02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:24.313
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

5812
02:29:24.350 --> 02:29:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5813
02:29:24.940 --> 02:29:25.830
<v Speaker 3>I mean that,</v>

5814
02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:26.751
<v Speaker 3>that is,</v>

5815
02:29:26.751 --> 02:29:28.430
<v Speaker 3>I never thought I would ever say that.</v>

5816
02:29:28.850 --> 02:29:29.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5817
02:29:29.380 --> 02:29:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I never thought that that would be a way that people would be going out either.</v>

5818
02:29:32.780 --> 02:29:33.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5819
02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:35.100
<v Speaker 3>I remember when we had Drake say there.</v>

5820
02:29:35.630 --> 02:29:36.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5821
02:29:36.170 --> 02:29:36.621
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5822
02:29:36.621 --> 02:29:37.454
<v Speaker 3>he was hard.</v>

5823
02:29:37.580 --> 02:29:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5824
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.940
<v Speaker 3>That was a hard one.</v>

5825
02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:41.120
<v Speaker 3>I knew Drake back in the,</v>

5826
02:29:41.150 --> 02:29:41.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5827
02:29:41.770 --> 02:29:44.180
<v Speaker 3>but essentially my open mic days.</v>

5828
02:29:44.210 --> 02:29:44.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5829
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:45.411
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>

5830
02:29:45.411 --> 02:29:48.460
<v Speaker 3>an established comedian in Boston and I was just starting out.</v>

5831
02:29:49.970 --> 02:29:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

5832
02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:54.380
<v Speaker 3>But so even though I'm happy that my brain injury,</v>

5833
02:29:54.830 --> 02:29:55.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

5834
02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:56.720
<v Speaker 3>Seems to have cured my depression.</v>

5835
02:29:56.750 --> 02:29:57.980
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking crazy.</v>

5836
02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:03.080
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the brain injury was responsible for Sam Kinison the car crash?</v>

5837
02:30:03.081 --> 02:30:03.231
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

5838
02:30:03.231 --> 02:30:03.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5839
02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:06.020
<v Speaker 3>We got hit by a car when he was a kid and became this wild man.</v>

5840
02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:06.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5841
02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:07.520
<v Speaker 3>Same thing with Roseanne.</v>

5842
02:30:07.521 --> 02:30:10.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the reasons why I wanted to have Roseanne on the podcast and talk</v>

5843
02:30:10.551 --> 02:30:11.180
<v Speaker 3>about her,</v>

5844
02:30:11.180 --> 02:30:12.140
<v Speaker 3>her issue with,</v>

5845
02:30:12.141 --> 02:30:12.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

5846
02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:15.560
<v Speaker 3>her television show and everything and her outbursts and all the crazy stuff she</v>

5847
02:30:15.561 --> 02:30:16.400
<v Speaker 3>says on Twitter.</v>

5848
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5849
02:30:16.900 --> 02:30:17.030
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

5850
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:20.060
<v Speaker 3>cause I know her and I know her past.</v>

5851
02:30:20.061 --> 02:30:22.070
<v Speaker 3>And so I right away at the beginning of the podcast,</v>

5852
02:30:22.071 --> 02:30:22.700
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

5853
02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:25.080
<v Speaker 3>let's get into what happened to you and it,</v>

5854
02:30:25.150 --> 02:30:26.720
<v Speaker 3>cause I don't think she talked about it that much.</v>

5855
02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:27.620
<v Speaker 3>She was hit by a car.</v>

5856
02:30:27.621 --> 02:30:30.650
<v Speaker 3>She was in a fucking Sikich is psychiatric corps for nine months.</v>

5857
02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5858
02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:34.400
<v Speaker 3>Like she was gone and she was never the same person to get on with this.</v>

5859
02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:35.600
<v Speaker 3>She was 15 years old.</v>

5860
02:30:36.040 --> 02:30:39.500
<v Speaker 3>She was walking across the street and someone had glare and their eyes from the</v>

5861
02:30:39.501 --> 02:30:41.750
<v Speaker 3>sun and didn't see her hit her with a car.</v>

5862
02:30:41.751 --> 02:30:42.584
<v Speaker 3>The fucking,</v>

5863
02:30:42.650 --> 02:30:44.270
<v Speaker 3>the hood ornament went into her head.</v>

5864
02:30:44.540 --> 02:30:44.811
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5865
02:30:44.811 --> 02:30:46.670
<v Speaker 3>she had a severe brain injury.</v>

5866
02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:49.160
<v Speaker 3>She couldn't count anymore.</v>

5867
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:50.480
<v Speaker 3>She couldn't do math anymore.</v>

5868
02:30:50.540 --> 02:30:51.200
<v Speaker 3>She was,</v>

5869
02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:55.280
<v Speaker 3>she was a very smart student before then and then crippled by it afterwards.</v>

5870
02:30:55.310 --> 02:30:55.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5871
02:30:55.640 --> 02:30:59.360
<v Speaker 3>And then for nine months she was in a psych ward and she talked about it.</v>

5872
02:30:59.550 --> 02:30:59.840
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5873
02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I wanted people to know like this is,</v>

5874
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:03.440
<v Speaker 3>anybody knows that they know now,</v>

5875
02:31:03.441 --> 02:31:05.330
<v Speaker 3>hopefully more than they knew then.</v>

5876
02:31:05.331 --> 02:31:07.100
<v Speaker 3>But people that work with her did,</v>

5877
02:31:07.101 --> 02:31:08.210
<v Speaker 3>so when they were writing her off,</v>

5878
02:31:08.211 --> 02:31:08.391
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

5879
02:31:08.391 --> 02:31:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>

5880
02:31:09.170 --> 02:31:11.390
<v Speaker 3>this is like taking a person with a broken leg and saying,</v>

5881
02:31:11.480 --> 02:31:11.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5882
02:31:11.931 --> 02:31:13.250
<v Speaker 3>I'm mad at you that you can't run.</v>

5883
02:31:13.850 --> 02:31:14.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5884
02:31:14.211 --> 02:31:14.940
<v Speaker 3>And this is the thing.</v>

5885
02:31:14.940 --> 02:31:16.070
<v Speaker 3>And like whatever your,</v>

5886
02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:16.580
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

5887
02:31:16.580 --> 02:31:19.570
<v Speaker 3>obviously Roseanne said some crazy and terrible and,</v>

5888
02:31:20.010 --> 02:31:21.630
<v Speaker 3>and messed up a lot of people's lives,</v>

5889
02:31:22.050 --> 02:31:24.480
<v Speaker 3>but she's also a genius.</v>

5890
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:26.110
<v Speaker 3>She's a comedic genius.</v>

5891
02:31:26.250 --> 02:31:30.630
<v Speaker 3>She also made that show one of the best shows on TV when it was originally on</v>

5892
02:31:30.631 --> 02:31:30.820
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

5893
02:31:30.820 --> 02:31:32.040
<v Speaker 3>she's always done crazy shit.</v>

5894
02:31:32.070 --> 02:31:34.590
<v Speaker 3>You remember once you grabbed her crotch and spit when she did the national</v>

5895
02:31:34.591 --> 02:31:35.670
<v Speaker 3>anthem and everybody hated her,</v>

5896
02:31:35.671 --> 02:31:36.580
<v Speaker 3>then they went crazy.</v>

5897
02:31:36.581 --> 02:31:39.090
<v Speaker 3>And this is like early two thousands she did that.</v>

5898
02:31:39.091 --> 02:31:40.290
<v Speaker 3>She was always wild.</v>

5899
02:31:40.291 --> 02:31:42.000
<v Speaker 3>But that was why she was so good as a calm.</v>

5900
02:31:42.010 --> 02:31:43.070
<v Speaker 3>That was her appeal.</v>

5901
02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:44.700
<v Speaker 3>She did not give a fuck.</v>

5902
02:31:44.730 --> 02:31:45.563
<v Speaker 3>I'm predictable.</v>

5903
02:31:46.050 --> 02:31:46.661
<v Speaker 3>Just wild.</v>

5904
02:31:46.661 --> 02:31:49.130
<v Speaker 3>And that is like Kinison and it came out of head injuries,</v>

5905
02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:49.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5906
02:31:49.850 --> 02:31:51.390
<v Speaker 3>really well.</v>

5907
02:31:51.391 --> 02:31:54.870
<v Speaker 3>There was the famous story of the guy who was I guess working in a mine.</v>

5908
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:56.130
<v Speaker 3>There was an explosion and uh,</v>

5909
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:59.910
<v Speaker 3>like rebar went through his brain and they said before that he was the nicest</v>

5910
02:31:59.911 --> 02:32:01.350
<v Speaker 3>guy and after that he became,</v>

5911
02:32:01.351 --> 02:32:02.670
<v Speaker 3>they said he became evil.</v>

5912
02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:03.990
<v Speaker 3>He was just an evil person.</v>

5913
02:32:04.590 --> 02:32:07.050
<v Speaker 3>After this rebar went through the brain and a,</v>

5914
02:32:07.051 --> 02:32:11.100
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's also happens and whether the Texas school book depository shooter</v>

5915
02:32:11.250 --> 02:32:11.650
<v Speaker 3>and were not,</v>

5916
02:32:11.650 --> 02:32:12.770
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't school book depository,</v>

5917
02:32:13.870 --> 02:32:14.703
<v Speaker 3>Texas Tower,</v>

5918
02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:17.970
<v Speaker 3>the Texas Tower shooter to Texas Tower shooter had a brain tumor.</v>

5919
02:32:18.520 --> 02:32:19.860
<v Speaker 3>They found that out after he died.</v>

5920
02:32:19.861 --> 02:32:20.310
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

5921
02:32:20.310 --> 02:32:20.500
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

5922
02:32:20.500 --> 02:32:21.333
<v Speaker 3>this is what it was.</v>

5923
02:32:21.480 --> 02:32:24.150
<v Speaker 3>But you also have people who have suffered brain injuries and come out of it</v>

5924
02:32:24.151 --> 02:32:25.260
<v Speaker 3>being able to speak French.</v>

5925
02:32:25.261 --> 02:32:25.640
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5926
02:32:25.640 --> 02:32:26.040

<v Speaker 3>I know oral spray paint it.</v>

5931
02:32:29.190 --> 02:32:30.660
<v Speaker 3>They probably have a brain injury,</v>

5932
02:32:32.660 --> 02:32:33.770
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

5933
02:32:34.590 --> 02:32:38.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll be able to like suddenly can paint photo realistic paintings.</v>

5934
02:32:38.150 --> 02:32:38.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5935
02:32:38.730 --> 02:32:39.270
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

5936
02:32:39.270 --> 02:32:41.220
<v Speaker 3>I never had any artistic ability before,</v>

5937
02:32:41.221 --> 02:32:43.830
<v Speaker 3>but they have a brain injury and it unlocks it.</v>

5938
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:47.430
<v Speaker 3>All I got was sobriety at to call shake sample.</v>

5939
02:32:48.090 --> 02:32:48.871
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing though.</v>

5940
02:32:48.871 --> 02:32:50.100
<v Speaker 3>It does happen for real.</v>

5941
02:32:50.130 --> 02:32:50.641
<v Speaker 3>Well they don't.</v>

5942
02:32:50.641 --> 02:32:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5943
02:32:51.030 --> 02:32:52.560
<v Speaker 3>they can learn it quicker I think.</v>

5944
02:32:52.561 --> 02:32:55.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they know it and don't come out knowing it.</v>

5945
02:32:55.730 --> 02:32:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5946
02:32:55.920 --> 02:33:00.390
<v Speaker 3>the piano I've heard peanut field like literally could sit down and knew what to</v>

5947
02:33:00.391 --> 02:33:00.840
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

5948
02:33:00.840 --> 02:33:01.051
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5949
02:33:01.051 --> 02:33:02.250
<v Speaker 3>there's certain things that happened,</v>

5950
02:33:02.251 --> 02:33:02.461
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5951
02:33:02.461 --> 02:33:04.800
<v Speaker 3>If people have certain spectrum issues,</v>

5952
02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:05.221
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

5953
02:33:05.221 --> 02:33:07.080
<v Speaker 3>Where there are far better at mathematics,</v>

5954
02:33:07.350 --> 02:33:09.520
<v Speaker 3>far worse at social interactions,</v>

5955
02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:10.560
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

5956
02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:15.560
<v Speaker 3>there's pathways that are more lubed for you to figure things out that aren't as</v>

5957
02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:21.260
<v Speaker 3>confused by social issues or social stigmas or just normal human communication.</v>

5958
02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:24.830
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's people in history,</v>

5959
02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:25.330
<v Speaker 3>a lot of them are,</v>

5960

<v Speaker 3>a lot of them,</v>

5961
02:33:26.190 --> 02:33:28.890
<v Speaker 3>a lot of super fucking geniuses are on spectrum.</v>

5962
02:33:28.890 --> 02:33:30.840
<v Speaker 3>Einstein didn't speak till he was five.</v>

5967
02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:34.530
<v Speaker 3>they thought he was,</v>

5968
02:33:34.530 --> 02:33:35.700
<v Speaker 3>he was mentally retarded.</v>

5969

6023
02:34:33.311 --> 02:34:34.390
<v Speaker 2>I was preparing cause I,</v>

6024
02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:37.270

6032
02:34:46.090 --> 02:34:48.040
<v Speaker 2>How far did you get a,</v>

6033
02:34:48.041 --> 02:34:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I went to a year and a half without drinking.</v>

6034
02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:51.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that's pretty good.</v>

6035
02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6036

<v Speaker 2>I hate it.</v>

6037
02:34:53.030 --> 02:34:53.740
<v Speaker 2>Hated it.</v>

6038
02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:54.820
<v Speaker 2>Hated every minute of it.</v>

6042
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:57.311
<v Speaker 2>every day.</v>

6043
02:34:57.311 --> 02:34:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would be nice to drink every day.</v>

6044
02:35:00.490 --> 02:35:02.050
<v Speaker 2>He just hung in there for a few hundred days.</v>

6045
02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:02.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6046

6048
02:35:04.030 --> 02:35:04.863
<v Speaker 2>but like this time,</v>

6049
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:05.710
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

6050
02:35:05.710 --> 02:35:06.161
<v Speaker 2>But even now,</v>

6051
02:35:06.161 --> 02:35:07.000
<v Speaker 2>like I'll still let go.</v>

6052
02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:07.833
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

6053
02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:08.440

02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:08.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6055
02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I do miss the taste of Scotch,</v>

6056
02:35:10.720 --> 02:35:11.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6057
02:35:11.160 --> 02:35:14.530
<v Speaker 2>because you've worked so hard to learn to like it and you know,</v>

6058
02:35:14.700 --> 02:35:15.970
<v Speaker 2>you really like Scott.</v>

6059
02:35:17.230 --> 02:35:19.810
<v Speaker 2>What are the positive benefits of not drinking,</v>

6060
02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:21.160
<v Speaker 2>of not drinking?</v>

6061
02:35:21.580 --> 02:35:22.413
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6062
02:35:22.450 --> 02:35:23.283
<v Speaker 2>you don't hit me.</v>

6063
02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:24.393
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

6064
02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:25.660
<v Speaker 2>But that's the only positive for you,</v>

6065
02:35:25.661 --> 02:35:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Paul.</v>

6066
02:35:26.050 --> 02:35:26.471
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

6067
02:35:26.471 --> 02:35:28.480
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were really affect me.</v>

6068
02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

6069
02:35:29.780 --> 02:35:30.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6070
02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.560
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

6071
02:35:32.561 --> 02:35:33.394
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6072
02:35:33.790 --> 02:35:34.750
<v Speaker 2>not that,</v>

6073
02:35:34.751 --> 02:35:36.150
<v Speaker 2>that I don't do anything to,</v>

6074
02:35:36.210 --> 02:35:36.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6075
02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:39.910
<v Speaker 2>unknowingly embarrass my daughter if I need to embarrass my daughter.</v>

6076
02:35:39.911 --> 02:35:41.470
<v Speaker 2>Now it's deliberate,</v>

6077
02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:42.753
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

6078
02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:43.603
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6079
02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:44.590
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

6080
02:35:44.590 --> 02:35:44.831
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6081
02:35:44.831 --> 02:35:45.580
<v Speaker 2>this mostly just,</v>

6082
02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:46.413
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

6083
02:35:46.510 --> 02:35:46.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6084
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:48.010
<v Speaker 2>remembering things,</v>

6085
02:35:48.011 --> 02:35:50.200
<v Speaker 2>knowing where I was the night before.</v>

6086
02:35:50.770 --> 02:35:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't drink and I embarrassed my son every single day by walking around.</v>

6087
02:35:55.170 --> 02:35:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

6088
02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Just and just,</v>

6089
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:58.480
<v Speaker 2>just being next to them.</v>

6090
02:35:58.481 --> 02:35:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6091
02:35:58.840 --> 02:35:59.141
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

6092
02:35:59.141 --> 02:35:59.830
<v Speaker 2>come on dad.</v>

6093
02:35:59.830 --> 02:36:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you think you are a genetic alcoholic or is this like a learn thing?</v>

6094
02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:04.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6095
02:36:04.661 --> 02:36:07.600
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say cause I mean obviously alcoholism runs in my family,</v>

6096
02:36:07.630 --> 02:36:09.190
<v Speaker 2>but is that just because you know,</v>

6097
02:36:09.191 --> 02:36:11.170
<v Speaker 2>we were raised by a horrible alcoholic.</v>

6098
02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's genetically genetic?</v>

6099
02:36:15.220 --> 02:36:17.830
<v Speaker 2>It's probably genetic predisposition to it.</v>

6100
02:36:18.020 --> 02:36:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6101
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:21.130
<v Speaker 2>I think there's genetic connections to almost all behavior.</v>

6102
02:36:21.160 --> 02:36:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6103
02:36:21.730 --> 02:36:22.330
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

6104
02:36:22.330 --> 02:36:22.541
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6105
02:36:22.541 --> 02:36:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>

6106
02:36:23.010 --> 02:36:23.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6107
02:36:23.650 --> 02:36:23.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6108
02:36:23.831 --> 02:36:24.664
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's a,</v>

6109
02:36:24.670 --> 02:36:26.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of real freewill.</v>

6110
02:36:26.570 --> 02:36:27.403
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

6111
02:36:27.820 --> 02:36:30.880
<v Speaker 2>I've come to that more and more as I get older.</v>

6112
02:36:30.881 --> 02:36:32.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean I battle with it.</v>

6113
02:36:32.051 --> 02:36:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Cause obviously there are conscious choices that you can make and yeah,</v>

6114
02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:39.960
<v Speaker 2>especially when you really make an effort to move into a certain path of the way</v>

6115
02:36:40.481 --> 02:36:41.950
<v Speaker 2>of the thinking and believing.</v>

6116
02:36:41.951 --> 02:36:43.660
<v Speaker 2>But what's causing that,</v>

6117
02:36:43.720 --> 02:36:44.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6118
02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:47.230
<v Speaker 2>how much of his life experience you can make conscious efforts to,</v>

6119
02:36:47.470 --> 02:36:51.100
<v Speaker 2>I guess ameliorate the influences of your genes.</v>

6120
02:36:51.610 --> 02:36:51.971
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

6121
02:36:51.971 --> 02:36:52.540
<v Speaker 2>it's like you could,</v>

6122
02:36:52.540 --> 02:36:53.440
<v Speaker 2>you could live healthy,</v>

6123
02:36:53.441 --> 02:36:57.760
<v Speaker 2>eat healthy and avoid risks and you're still going to probably die around 110 at</v>

6124
02:36:57.761 --> 02:36:58.211
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>

6125
02:36:58.211 --> 02:36:59.800
<v Speaker 2>At best if everything goes great,</v>

6126
02:36:59.830 --> 02:37:02.140
<v Speaker 2>unless some new advanced medicine,</v>

6127
02:37:02.260 --> 02:37:03.660
<v Speaker 2>we're going farther that guys come on.</v>

6128
02:37:03.810 --> 02:37:06.190
<v Speaker 2>We very well could we very well could.</v>

6129
02:37:06.191 --> 02:37:06.401
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

6130
02:37:06.401 --> 02:37:08.380
<v Speaker 2>I had David Sinclair from Harvard on,</v>

6131
02:37:08.890 --> 02:37:09.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6132
02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:14.050
<v Speaker 2>two weeks ago who's a life extension specialist who fascinating shit.</v>

6133
02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:16.250
<v Speaker 2>We've got to stop those telex and I'm snapping</v>

6134
02:37:16.250 --> 02:37:16.610
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

6135
02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:17.443
<v Speaker 3>I remember the,</v>

6136
02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:17.960
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

6137
02:37:17.960 --> 02:37:19.700
<v Speaker 3>the notion because people will always talk about it.</v>

6138
02:37:19.701 --> 02:37:19.821
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

6139
02:37:19.821 --> 02:37:22.310
<v Speaker 3>human lifespan is we used to live to be 40 on air,</v>

6140
02:37:22.460 --> 02:37:25.670
<v Speaker 3>but human lifespan hasn't changed at all since,</v>

6141
02:37:25.671 --> 02:37:26.840
<v Speaker 3>since essentially,</v>

6142
02:37:26.841 --> 02:37:27.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6143
02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:28.453
<v Speaker 3>the beginnings of,</v>

6144
02:37:28.460 --> 02:37:31.370
<v Speaker 3>of human beings hasn't changed at all.</v>

6145
02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:32.630
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

6146
02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:36.080
<v Speaker 3>the oldest possible lifespan is still exactly the same as it was,</v>

6147
02:37:36.590 --> 02:37:37.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6148
02:37:37.050 --> 02:37:37.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

6149
02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:38.480
<v Speaker 3>50,000 years,</v>

6150
02:37:39.350 --> 02:37:39.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6151
02:37:39.980 --> 02:37:40.813
<v Speaker 3>and has just,</v>

6152
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:41.990
<v Speaker 3>it's just more people,</v>

6153
02:37:41.991 --> 02:37:43.750
<v Speaker 3>fewer people are dying young frack,</v>

6154
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:44.270
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

6155
02:37:44.270 --> 02:37:46.670
<v Speaker 3>More people are living close to their potential.</v>

6156
02:37:46.700 --> 02:37:48.590
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of that is infant mortality.</v>

6157
02:37:48.591 --> 02:37:50.270
<v Speaker 3>If you look at the actual statistics,</v>

6158
02:37:50.271 --> 02:37:51.590
<v Speaker 3>the reason why it's so low,</v>

6159
02:37:51.980 --> 02:37:54.660
<v Speaker 3>it's not necessarily that no one lived to be 65 back.</v>

6160
02:37:56.780 --> 02:37:58.820
<v Speaker 3>Babies died thousands of years ago.</v>

6161
02:37:58.821 --> 02:38:00.530
<v Speaker 3>People did live to be over a hundred,</v>

6162
02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:01.760
<v Speaker 3>but back then,</v>

6163
02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:04.370
<v Speaker 3>scratch your foot and then died two weeks later.</v>

6164
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:05.200
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

6165
02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:05.980
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6166
02:38:05.980 --> 02:38:06.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6167
02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:09.800
<v Speaker 3>But maximum human lifespan hasn't changed at all.</v>

6168
02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:12.350
<v Speaker 3>And that's the thing that maybe is going to start changing.</v>

6169
02:38:12.351 --> 02:38:13.400
<v Speaker 3>Do you exercise at all?</v>

6170
02:38:13.610 --> 02:38:14.330
<v Speaker 3>Never.</v>

6171
02:38:14.330 --> 02:38:14.631
<v Speaker 3>Never,</v>

6172
02:38:14.631 --> 02:38:15.430
<v Speaker 3>ever in your life.</v>

6173
02:38:15.430 --> 02:38:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

6174
02:38:15.850 --> 02:38:16.311
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

6175
02:38:16.311 --> 02:38:17.600
<v Speaker 3>as a kid I liked sports.</v>

6176
02:38:17.840 --> 02:38:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Never like go for a hike or anything.</v>

6177
02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:20.570
<v Speaker 3>Very rarely.</v>

6178
02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Very refill.</v>

6179
02:38:21.600 --> 02:38:22.250
<v Speaker 3>Really good.</v>

6180
02:38:22.250 --> 02:38:23.060
<v Speaker 3>I probably would,</v>

6181
02:38:23.060 --> 02:38:23.360
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

6182
02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:24.680
<v Speaker 3>It would relieve a lot of tension.</v>

6183
02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:25.140
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

6184
02:38:25.140 --> 02:38:26.030
<v Speaker 3>just a little height,</v>

6185
02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:26.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6186
02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:28.250
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do anything crazy.</v>

6187
02:38:28.430 --> 02:38:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

6188
02:38:28.790 --> 02:38:28.941
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6189
02:38:28.941 --> 02:38:29.480
<v Speaker 3>I keep meaning,</v>

6190
02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:30.320
<v Speaker 3>especially now that I'm,</v>

6191
02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:32.600
<v Speaker 3>I think not just getting older,</v>

6192
02:38:32.601 --> 02:38:33.560
<v Speaker 3>but actually old.</v>

6193
02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:34.453
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6194
02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:36.140
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually old dude.</v>

6195
02:38:36.141 --> 02:38:37.400
<v Speaker 3>We were young when we met.</v>

6196
02:38:37.430 --> 02:38:38.510
<v Speaker 3>I know old people.</v>

6197
02:38:38.511 --> 02:38:39.170
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

6198
02:38:39.170 --> 02:38:40.670
<v Speaker 3>If a kid sees us like,</v>

02:38:43.430 --> 02:38:44.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6209
02:38:50.450 --> 02:38:51.210

02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:06.513
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6269
02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:08.710
<v Speaker 3>stop doing stand up once you got the television.</v>

6270
02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:09.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6271
02:40:09.790 --> 02:40:10.623
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

6272
02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:11.533
<v Speaker 3>I love that guy.</v>

6273
02:40:12.020 --> 02:40:12.853
<v Speaker 3>I don't see him enough.</v>

6274
02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

6275
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:15.870
<v Speaker 4>it's cool to see you two guys together.</v>

6276
02:40:16.410 --> 02:40:17.243
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

6277
02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:17.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6278
02:40:17.970 --> 02:40:18.803
<v Speaker 4>cause that's,</v>

6279
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:20.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say it's a lifetime ago,</v>

6280
02:40:21.200 --> 02:40:22.030
<v Speaker 4>last a lifetime,</v>

6281
02:40:22.030 --> 02:40:23.730
<v Speaker 4>but those are in your,</v>

6282
02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:25.290
<v Speaker 4>in 20s and 30s.</v>

6283
02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:26.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6284
02:40:26.170 --> 02:40:28.860
<v Speaker 4>I was a totally different human being when I was 27.</v>

6285
02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:30.810
<v Speaker 4>You were 100%.</v>

6286
02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:31.673
<v Speaker 4>What's,</v>

6287
02:40:32.310 --> 02:40:32.700
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

6288
02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:33.810
<v Speaker 4>I guess it was crazy.</v>

6289
02:40:33.990 --> 02:40:34.650
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

6290
02:40:34.650 --> 02:40:36.150
<v Speaker 4>I was completely insane.</v>

6291
02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:36.690
<v Speaker 4>What,</v>

6292
02:40:36.690 --> 02:40:37.140
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

6293
02:40:37.140 --> 02:40:39.030
<v Speaker 4>what was the switch for you?</v>

6294
02:40:39.870 --> 02:40:40.051
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6295
02:40:40.051 --> 02:40:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I've got older and wiser and realize how fucking stupid it was.</v>

6296
02:40:43.081 --> 02:40:43.740
<v Speaker 4>But also,</v>

6297
02:40:43.740 --> 02:40:44.041
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6298
02:40:44.041 --> 02:40:46.260
<v Speaker 4>I was only a few years removed from fighting.</v>

6299
02:40:46.710 --> 02:40:46.981
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6300
02:40:46.981 --> 02:40:49.290
<v Speaker 4>when I first started doing a news radio,</v>

6301
02:40:49.291 --> 02:40:54.291
<v Speaker 4>it was only like five years removed from my last fight and I still was sparring.</v>

6302
02:40:56.220 --> 02:40:57.990
<v Speaker 4>So it's still getting hit in the head a lot.</v>

6303
02:40:58.050 --> 02:41:01.470
<v Speaker 4>Would you like come in to work with a face full of bruises?</v>

6304
02:41:01.650 --> 02:41:01.831
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6305
02:41:01.831 --> 02:41:02.700
<v Speaker 4>not that bad.</v>

6306
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:07.050
<v Speaker 4>I started doing Jujitsu somewhere around news radio to run 96 so that was like,</v>

6307
02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:10.740
<v Speaker 4>I stopped really s kickboxing very much after that.</v>

6308
02:41:11.130 --> 02:41:14.760
<v Speaker 4>And then I think I stopped entirely when I was like 30 I just realized like,</v>

6309
02:41:14.761 --> 02:41:15.630
<v Speaker 4>this is got to stop.</v>

6310
02:41:15.660 --> 02:41:16.590
<v Speaker 4>I gotta stop doing this.</v>

6311
02:41:16.620 --> 02:41:17.431
<v Speaker 4>So you weren't smart,</v>

6312
02:41:17.431 --> 02:41:21.030
<v Speaker 4>you like this fit guy that just left it all behind or where you were always did</v>

6313
02:41:21.031 --> 02:41:21.864
<v Speaker 4>you always keep it up?</v>

6314
02:41:22.170 --> 02:41:23.580
<v Speaker 4>I work out for sanity.</v>

6315
02:41:23.750 --> 02:41:26.250
<v Speaker 4>I've always worked out for hand and a lot of people that do that,</v>

6316
02:41:26.251 --> 02:41:27.084
<v Speaker 4>I need it,</v>

6317
02:41:27.300 --> 02:41:27.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6318
02:41:27.811 --> 02:41:29.280
<v Speaker 4>for whatever it is.</v>

6319
02:41:29.281 --> 02:41:34.281
<v Speaker 4>And also like my personality was sort of forged by having these moments of</v>

6320
02:41:36.481 --> 02:41:39.030
<v Speaker 4>clarity after extreme exertion.</v>

6321
02:41:39.300 --> 02:41:39.481
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6322
02:41:39.481 --> 02:41:40.280
<v Speaker 4>there was those sort of,</v>

6323
02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:41.640
<v Speaker 4>my personnel was formed that way.</v>

6324
02:41:41.641 --> 02:41:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Like if I had a problem,</v>

6325
02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:44.520
<v Speaker 4>if I had something that I was dealing with,</v>

6326
02:41:44.521 --> 02:41:47.610
<v Speaker 4>I would just blow it out at the gym and then I'd have a better look at it and</v>

6327
02:41:47.611 --> 02:41:50.040
<v Speaker 4>probably wind up calling somebody in apologizing or so.</v>

6328
02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:50.820
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

6329
02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:54.120
<v Speaker 4>It's like a rush of oxygen to the brain.</v>

6330
02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:54.541
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6331
02:41:54.541 --> 02:41:54.870
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6332
02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:56.070
<v Speaker 4>Russell Rush of oxygen,</v>

6333
02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:57.750
<v Speaker 4>the brain and maybe even more important,</v>

6334
02:41:57.780 --> 02:42:01.950
<v Speaker 4>more important that a draining of excess energy.</v>

6335
02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:02.280
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

6336
02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Because I think,</v>

6337
02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:03.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6338
02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:04.380
<v Speaker 4>once you,</v>

6339
02:42:04.380 --> 02:42:06.390
<v Speaker 4>if you develop a certain way,</v>

6340
02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:11.600
<v Speaker 4>like I did martial arts literally most of my adult life and growing life up</v>

6341
02:42:11.701 --> 02:42:12.534
<v Speaker 4>until that point.</v>

6342
02:42:12.750 --> 02:42:13.740
<v Speaker 4>And so my,</v>

6343
02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:19.020
<v Speaker 4>my body had sort of developed with this need for that exertion in order to have</v>

6344
02:42:19.021 --> 02:42:19.854
<v Speaker 4>clarity.</v>

6345
02:42:20.310 --> 02:42:23.040
<v Speaker 4>And so I just am like this is my formula.</v>

6346
02:42:23.070 --> 02:42:24.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm sticking with it so I never let it go.</v>

6347
02:42:24.810 --> 02:42:29.460
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that you did stick that you've never gone away from that.</v>

6348
02:42:29.490 --> 02:42:30.323
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

6349
02:42:31.170 --> 02:42:32.490
<v Speaker 4>I won't think right.</v>

6350
02:42:32.550 --> 02:42:33.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't think right.</v>

6351
02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:34.241
<v Speaker 4>I think we,</v>

6352
02:42:34.241 --> 02:42:37.320
<v Speaker 4>I think so much better when I exercise.</v>

6353
02:42:37.321 --> 02:42:38.460
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's no comparison.</v>

6354
02:42:38.461 --> 02:42:39.330
<v Speaker 4>It's like a pill.</v>

6355
02:42:39.450 --> 02:42:43.080
<v Speaker 4>I did this a sober October fitness challenge,</v>

6356
02:42:43.081 --> 02:42:44.300
<v Speaker 4>things with my friends uh,</v>

6357
02:42:44.380 --> 02:42:45.930
<v Speaker 4>in October and uh,</v>

6358
02:42:45.931 --> 02:42:47.160
<v Speaker 4>we went crazy.</v>

6359
02:42:47.161 --> 02:42:49.680
<v Speaker 4>We were working on like three hours a day cause we were wearing these heart</v>

6360
02:42:49.681 --> 02:42:50.251
<v Speaker 4>monitors.</v>

6361
02:42:50.251 --> 02:42:53.130
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things that I wrecked cause we were trying to like get a certain</v>

6362
02:42:53.131 --> 02:42:54.950
<v Speaker 4>score and whoever got the highest score one,</v>

6363
02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:58.350
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I recognize from that was that the more I did in terms of</v>

6364
02:42:58.351 --> 02:42:58.801
<v Speaker 4>cardio,</v>

6365
02:42:58.801 --> 02:42:59.900
<v Speaker 4>especially the,</v>

6366
02:43:00.090 --> 02:43:01.890
<v Speaker 4>the last things bothered me,</v>

6367
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:03.810
<v Speaker 4>the middle or more clarity I had,</v>

6368
02:43:03.811 --> 02:43:05.040
<v Speaker 4>the more peaceful I felt,</v>

6369
02:43:05.041 --> 02:43:06.060
<v Speaker 4>the more at ease.</v>

6370
02:43:06.061 --> 02:43:07.530
<v Speaker 4>I felt no more,</v>

6371
02:43:07.531 --> 02:43:09.120
<v Speaker 4>no one internal chatter.</v>

6372
02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:10.133
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6373
02:43:10.620 --> 02:43:11.201
<v Speaker 4>I just think,</v>

6374
02:43:11.201 --> 02:43:11.530
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

6375
02:43:11.530 --> 02:43:12.100
<v Speaker 4>for whatever</v>

6376
02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:12.310
<v Speaker 2>reason,</v>

6377
02:43:12.310 --> 02:43:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean everyone has their own biological makeup.</v>

6378
02:43:14.831 --> 02:43:15.664
<v Speaker 2>And for me,</v>

6379
02:43:16.030 --> 02:43:16.570
<v Speaker 2>my boss,</v>

6380
02:43:16.570 --> 02:43:21.150
<v Speaker 2>my biological makeup is entirely dependent on the health benefits from it as if</v>

6381
02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:21.851
<v Speaker 2>it's a giant.</v>

6382
02:43:21.851 --> 02:43:22.510
<v Speaker 2>But for me,</v>

6383
02:43:22.510 --> 02:43:24.860
<v Speaker 2>my mind actually choose.</v>

6384
02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:25.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6385
02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:25.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6386
02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:28.210
<v Speaker 2>a friend of mine said that sitting is the new smoking.</v>

6387
02:43:28.590 --> 02:43:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6388
02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I think we say that,</v>

6389
02:43:29.510 --> 02:43:30.071
<v Speaker 2>that does that.</v>

6390
02:43:30.071 --> 02:43:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Does that make it good for you?</v>

6391
02:43:31.931 --> 02:43:32.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a compression of your,</v>

6392
02:43:33.020 --> 02:43:34.270
<v Speaker 2>your disks for sure.</v>

6393
02:43:34.570 --> 02:43:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Especially your lower back.</v>

6394
02:43:35.951 --> 02:43:37.360
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't have good posture,</v>

6395
02:43:37.361 --> 02:43:38.194
<v Speaker 2>it's not good,</v>

6396
02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:40.210
<v Speaker 2>but you can mitigate it with exercise.</v>

6397
02:43:40.270 --> 02:43:40.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

6398
02:43:40.580 --> 02:43:40.811
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

6399
02:43:40.811 --> 02:43:42.460
<v Speaker 2>you gotta make sure that you don't only sit,</v>

6400
02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:43.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6401
02:43:43.781 --> 02:43:45.970
<v Speaker 2>stretch yourself out and take a yoga class.</v>

6402
02:43:46.540 --> 02:43:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I should be writing this down.</v>

6403
02:43:47.650 --> 02:43:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Seriously.</v>

6404
02:43:48.450 --> 02:43:49.400

6435
02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Every school at some point had when the one hot girl was scoliosis who had the</v>

6436
02:44:43.850 --> 02:44:44.683
<v Speaker 2>headgear.</v>

6437
02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:46.353
<v Speaker 2>Every school,</v>

6438
02:44:47.950 --> 02:44:50.110
<v Speaker 2>she didn't have the headgear on and she's really hot.</v>

6439
02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:51.760
<v Speaker 2>They had to have headgear scoliosis.</v>

6440
02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:54.670
<v Speaker 2>They tried to straighten it out and back then it had metal,</v>

6441
02:44:55.090 --> 02:44:56.740
<v Speaker 2>like metal rods</v>

6442
02:44:58.750 --> 02:44:58.991
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>

6443

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

6444
02:44:59.290 --> 02:45:00.640
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was a broken neck.</v>

6445
02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:01.961
<v Speaker 2>Scoliosis.</v>

6446
02:45:01.961 --> 02:45:02.561
<v Speaker 2>That's a neck.</v>

6447
02:45:02.561 --> 02:45:02.751
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

6448
02:45:02.751 --> 02:45:05.700
<v Speaker 2>I got a girl that had a whole chest thing,</v>

6449
02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:10.120
<v Speaker 2>big plastic that she had to wear to keep it like spine street.</v>

6450
02:45:10.170 --> 02:45:11.470
<v Speaker 2>She didn't wear it for like two years or something.</v>

6451
02:45:11.480 --> 02:45:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Didn't work.</v>

6452
02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:12.941
<v Speaker 2>I sure.</v>

6453
02:45:12.941 --> 02:45:13.481
<v Speaker 2>I guess I don't,</v>

6454
02:45:13.481 --> 02:45:13.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean shit,</v>

6455
02:45:13.901 --> 02:45:14.770
<v Speaker 2>he didn't stay in touch.</v>

6456
02:45:15.370 --> 02:45:16.203
<v Speaker 2>What do they do with it?</v>

6457
02:45:16.880 --> 02:45:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6458
02:45:17.390 --> 02:45:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I still the same thing and I had a meeting with the specialist and he's like,</v>

6459
02:45:22.721 --> 02:45:25.480
<v Speaker 2>well I like operating on people.</v>

6460
02:45:27.100 --> 02:45:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

6461
02:45:27.640 --> 02:45:28.473
<v Speaker 2>that's what I do.</v>

6462
02:45:29.210 --> 02:45:30.470
<v Speaker 2>That's why I got into this.</v>

6463
02:45:30.770 --> 02:45:32.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm like cutting them when they're asleep,</v>

6464
02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:33.641
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

6465
02:45:33.641 --> 02:45:36.490
<v Speaker 2>you could do some exercises and some uh,</v>

6466
02:45:36.491 --> 02:45:36.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

6467
02:45:36.971 --> 02:45:39.160
<v Speaker 2>physical therapy and stuff to alleviate it.</v>

6468
02:45:39.610 --> 02:45:42.400
<v Speaker 2>And if it gets so bad down the road,</v>

6469
02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I could maybe help you out with some rods.</v>

6470
02:45:46.090 --> 02:45:50.500
<v Speaker 2>So there you went in there because there was an initial issue I had,</v>

6471
02:45:50.530 --> 02:45:52.510
<v Speaker 2>I had like issues when I was young.</v>

6472
02:45:52.511 --> 02:45:54.460
<v Speaker 2>When I used to do like track and field and stuff,</v>

6473
02:45:54.461 --> 02:45:58.870
<v Speaker 2>I would get like a pain in an area and then it Kinda went away most of my life.</v>

6474
02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Then I started golfing and then they go off more and more and then one day I</v>

6475
02:46:02.981 --> 02:46:03.814
<v Speaker 2>didn't warm up.</v>

6476
02:46:04.190 --> 02:46:05.023
<v Speaker 2>I did a,</v>

6477
02:46:05.080 --> 02:46:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I did a twist and it just freaking,</v>

6485
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:21.740
<v Speaker 2>That's a strange look.</v>

02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:37.040
<v Speaker 2>it is androgynous phase.</v>

6497
02:46:37.270 --> 02:46:38.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6498
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.481
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

6499
02:46:38.481 --> 02:46:42.680
<v Speaker 2>I just got to suck it up and exercise and get a strong core and I should be</v>

6500
02:46:42.681 --> 02:46:43.010
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>

6501
02:46:43.010 --> 02:46:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Take Yoga as I got to do that.</v>

6502
02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:45.871
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

6503
02:46:45.871 --> 02:46:46.050
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

6504
02:46:46.050 --> 02:46:48.560
<v Speaker 2>I keep hearing for old people all the time.</v>

6505
02:46:49.130 --> 02:46:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Did you just start it as an old person?</v>

6506
02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:51.451
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6507
02:46:51.451 --> 02:46:55.500
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do when I was younger and then I didn't do it seriously until about</v>

6508
02:46:55.501 --> 02:46:56.281
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

6509
02:46:56.281 --> 02:46:57.300
<v Speaker 4>four years ago.</v>

6510
02:46:57.570 --> 02:47:00.620
<v Speaker 4>Then it's do it and now we do it because you always did martial arts and</v>

6511
02:47:00.700 --> 02:47:03.660
<v Speaker 4>obviously like yoga was for people that just were too lazy for martial arts.</v>

6512
02:47:03.690 --> 02:47:04.950
<v Speaker 4>No yogas.</v>

6513
02:47:04.980 --> 02:47:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Yoga does some things that really enhance martial arts in because the hot yoga</v>

6514
02:47:09.301 --> 02:47:09.780
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

6515
02:47:09.780 --> 02:47:09.991
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6516
02:47:09.991 --> 02:47:10.824
<v Speaker 4>I like that stuff.</v>

6517
02:47:11.160 --> 02:47:12.300
<v Speaker 4>That seems like torture to me.</v>

6518
02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:13.290
<v Speaker 4>It is a little bit of torture,</v>

6519
02:47:13.291 --> 02:47:16.140
<v Speaker 4>but it's really good for you because your body produces heat shock proteins that</v>

6520
02:47:16.141 --> 02:47:17.700
<v Speaker 4>are similar to when you go into a sauna.</v>

6521
02:47:18.270 --> 02:47:20.190
<v Speaker 4>It feel great when you come out of there and you feel great,</v>

6522
02:47:20.191 --> 02:47:21.870
<v Speaker 4>but it's also really good for inflammation.</v>

6523
02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:24.360
<v Speaker 4>Just the act of doing it in cell itself,</v>

6524
02:47:24.390 --> 02:47:28.080
<v Speaker 4>in the extreme heat like sauna would be amazing for you to for that reason.</v>

6525
02:47:28.110 --> 02:47:28.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6526
02:47:28.580 --> 02:47:29.380
<v Speaker 4>when heat shocked,</v>

6527
02:47:29.380 --> 02:47:32.460
<v Speaker 4>but there's a woman named Doctor Rhonda Patrick That's a regular on the show.</v>

6528
02:47:32.461 --> 02:47:34.320
<v Speaker 4>I have her on all the time and she's genius.</v>

6529
02:47:34.560 --> 02:47:39.560
<v Speaker 4>She's a huge believer in sauna and they did a study and what was it like Sweden</v>

6530
02:47:40.411 --> 02:47:45.411
<v Speaker 4>or some shit where they took people with a regular sauna use versus not.</v>

6531
02:47:46.351 --> 02:47:50.520
<v Speaker 4>And the regular sauna use had a 40% decrease in all cause mortality.</v>

6532
02:47:50.700 --> 02:47:51.481
<v Speaker 4>Heart attack,</v>

6533
02:47:51.481 --> 02:47:52.314
<v Speaker 4>stroke,</v>

6534
02:47:52.350 --> 02:47:53.183
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>

6535
02:47:53.250 --> 02:47:53.730
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

6536
02:47:53.730 --> 02:47:54.450
<v Speaker 4>Because you're,</v>

6537
02:47:54.450 --> 02:47:58.050
<v Speaker 4>when you're regular using it 20 minutes a day for four days a week,</v>

6538
02:47:58.320 --> 02:48:01.830
<v Speaker 4>what they're essentially saying is that your body producing those heat shock</v>

6539
02:48:01.831 --> 02:48:04.230
<v Speaker 4>proteins and those sidechains 20 minutes of Yoga.</v>

6540
02:48:04.231 --> 02:48:04.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6541
02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:04.691
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6542
02:48:04.691 --> 02:48:04.760
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6543
02:48:04.760 --> 02:48:05.010
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

6544
02:48:05.010 --> 02:48:05.290
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

6545
02:48:05.290 --> 02:48:05.730
<v Speaker 4>Heat,</v>

6546
02:48:05.730 --> 02:48:06.300
<v Speaker 4>heat,</v>

6547
02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:06.670
<v Speaker 4>sauna.</v>

6548
02:48:06.670 --> 02:48:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Just sitting in a sauna going on out here,</v>

6549
02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:11.100
<v Speaker 4>sit in the Sauna,</v>

6550
02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:16.100
<v Speaker 4>20 minutes that just doing that is a fee because almost all ailments and issues</v>

6551
02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:18.560
<v Speaker 4>and deal with inflammation.</v>

6552
02:48:18.600 --> 02:48:18.870
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

6553
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6554
02:48:19.380 --> 02:48:19.771
<v Speaker 2>Well I,</v>

6555
02:48:19.771 --> 02:48:20.150
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

6556
02:48:20.150 --> 02:48:20.560
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6557
02:48:20.560 --> 02:48:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I have to pinch nerves right now and like herniated discs and uh,</v>

6558
02:48:27.660 --> 02:48:28.530
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

6559
02:48:28.531 --> 02:48:29.190
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

6560
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:30.960
<v Speaker 2>like on the couch for like two months.</v>

6561
02:48:30.961 --> 02:48:32.010
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't sell it from your injury?</v>

6562
02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6563
02:48:32.670 --> 02:48:33.360
<v Speaker 2>no I don't.</v>

6564
02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was,</v>

6565
02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:35.101
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it was from,</v>

6566
02:48:35.101 --> 02:48:35.741
<v Speaker 2>but it was a,</v>

6567
02:48:35.741 --> 02:48:36.391
<v Speaker 2>it may have been,</v>

6568
02:48:36.391 --> 02:48:36.811
<v Speaker 2>it may have been,</v>

6569
02:48:36.811 --> 02:48:37.330
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>

6570
02:48:37.330 --> 02:48:38.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6571
02:48:38.130 --> 02:48:39.720
<v Speaker 2>like one day it just started my arm,</v>

6572
02:48:39.750 --> 02:48:42.810
<v Speaker 2>my arm started hurting and pin pointing towards your neck.</v>

6573
02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:43.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6574
02:48:43.291 --> 02:48:44.430
<v Speaker 2>It's like somewhere in here,</v>

6575
02:48:44.450 --> 02:48:45.283
<v Speaker 2>the herniated disc.</v>

6576
02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:46.233
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

6577
02:48:47.670 --> 02:48:48.770
<v Speaker 2>Is your lower right?</v>

6578
02:48:49.140 --> 02:48:49.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6579
02:48:49.770 --> 02:48:49.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6580
02:48:49.951 --> 02:48:50.820
<v Speaker 2>That's your lower back.</v>

6581
02:48:50.821 --> 02:48:51.654
<v Speaker 2>But the uh,</v>

6582
02:48:52.090 --> 02:48:52.510
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

6583
02:48:52.510 --> 02:48:53.281
<v Speaker 2>I like from my arm,</v>

6584
02:48:53.281 --> 02:48:53.910
<v Speaker 2>her two months,</v>

6585
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:54.450
<v Speaker 2>my arm,</v>

6586
02:48:54.450 --> 02:48:54.931
<v Speaker 2>my arm,</v>

6587
02:48:54.931 --> 02:48:57.390
<v Speaker 2>my arm felt like it was going to explode.</v>

6588
02:48:57.970 --> 02:49:00.630
<v Speaker 2>It felt like there was this pressure building up in it and it was literally like</v>

6589
02:49:00.631 --> 02:49:00.860
<v Speaker 2>Blake,</v>

6590
02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:04.880
<v Speaker 2>he was going to explode and I was getting like a,</v>

6591
02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:05.760
<v Speaker 2>what do they call,</v>

6592
02:49:05.760 --> 02:49:06.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6593
02:49:06.250 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 2>the kind of the shots you get when</v>

6594
02:49:07.990 --> 02:49:09.650
<v Speaker 3>you're having an epidural.</v>

6595
02:49:09.660 --> 02:49:11.670
<v Speaker 3>I was getting epidural shots that were doing nothing.</v>

6596
02:49:11.671 --> 02:49:13.410
<v Speaker 3>I was taking 16 Advil a day.</v>

6597
02:49:13.440 --> 02:49:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

6598
02:49:13.930 --> 02:49:14.763
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

6599
02:49:15.580 --> 02:49:16.413
<v Speaker 3>take that.</v>

6600
02:49:16.570 --> 02:49:18.390
<v Speaker 3>And I was getting no pain relief.</v>

6601
02:49:19.770 --> 02:49:22.020
<v Speaker 3>And then I started using CBD.</v>

6602
02:49:22.290 --> 02:49:23.670
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>

6603
02:49:23.730 --> 02:49:25.320
<v Speaker 3>and like that,</v>

6604
02:49:25.321 --> 02:49:26.154
<v Speaker 3>it was gone.</v>

6605
02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Amazing.</v>

6606
02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:27.953
<v Speaker 3>And even now it's like,</v>

6607
02:49:27.970 --> 02:49:28.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6608
02:49:28.230 --> 02:49:28.621
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>

6609
02:49:28.621 --> 02:49:30.720
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do anything for two solid months.</v>

6610
02:49:30.721 --> 02:49:31.740
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't get off the couch.</v>

6611
02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:33.030
<v Speaker 3>CVD is incredible.</v>

6612
02:49:33.150 --> 02:49:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6613
02:49:33.630 --> 02:49:36.090
<v Speaker 3>I use that stuff so much that I got the rubbing stuff.</v>

6614
02:49:36.091 --> 02:49:36.770
<v Speaker 3>That's great too.</v>

6615
02:49:36.770 --> 02:49:39.030
<v Speaker 3>It makes it better for about two days.</v>

6616
02:49:39.031 --> 02:49:40.220
<v Speaker 3>My friend Hahn's though,</v>

6617
02:49:40.370 --> 02:49:42.420
<v Speaker 3>he told me he has a shortage,</v>

6618
02:49:42.450 --> 02:49:46.230
<v Speaker 3>recent shoulder surgery and he said everybody likes to use the rub stuff,</v>

6619
02:49:46.231 --> 02:49:49.320
<v Speaker 3>but you really should take it with the edible stuff like oil,</v>

6620
02:49:49.321 --> 02:49:52.320
<v Speaker 3>oral CBD and rub stuff works together.</v>

6621
02:49:52.350 --> 02:49:52.910
<v Speaker 3>Smoking.</v>

6622
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:53.430
<v Speaker 3>I started,</v>

6623
02:49:53.430 --> 02:49:54.570
<v Speaker 3>I had the cream.</v>

6624
02:49:54.610 --> 02:49:54.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

6625
02:49:54.760 --> 02:49:56.000
<v Speaker 3>just pop a pill.</v>

6626
02:49:56.220 --> 02:49:59.070
<v Speaker 3>I seem seen green that I've rubbed and then I started using the tincture with</v>

6627
02:49:59.071 --> 02:49:59.550
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

6628
02:49:59.550 --> 02:50:00.151
<v Speaker 3>We have some here.</v>

6629
02:50:00.151 --> 02:50:05.151
<v Speaker 3>If you want some case in the back that that case is given to us by a stay.</v>

6630
02:50:06.300 --> 02:50:06.900
<v Speaker 3>He'd we'd,</v>

6631
02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:07.051
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

6632
02:50:07.051 --> 02:50:10.460
<v Speaker 3>the big chest chest of marijuana.</v>

6633
02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:11.250
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of,</v>

6634
02:50:11.250 --> 02:50:12.270
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy and here's the thing.</v>

6635
02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:15.600
<v Speaker 3>Turn lights on and off tincture along with the the cream.</v>

6636
02:50:15.650 --> 02:50:15.900
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

6637
02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:16.381
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

6638
02:50:16.381 --> 02:50:17.610

02:50:21.751 --> 02:50:24.960
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't bend my hand and it's like that's gone.</v>

6644
02:50:25.160 --> 02:50:25.800
<v Speaker 3>Automation.</v>

<v Speaker 3>My arthritis in my knees completely gone.</v>

6648
02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:30.900
<v Speaker 3>It'll go away even further if we cut out sugar.</v>

6649
02:50:31.430 --> 02:50:32.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6650
02:50:32.090 --> 02:50:33.240
<v Speaker 3>that sugar and bread.</v>

6651
02:50:33.450 --> 02:50:34.920
<v Speaker 3>I did that and I felt fantastic.</v>

6652
02:50:34.940 --> 02:50:36.450
<v Speaker 3>That's the sugar was gone crazy.</v>

6653
02:50:36.451 --> 02:50:37.284
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

6654
02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:38.850
<v Speaker 3>Pours in ourselves our whole lives.</v>

6655
02:50:38.910 --> 02:50:39.241
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>

6656
02:50:39.241 --> 02:50:40.700
<v Speaker 3>that is a poison sugar.</v>

6657
02:50:40.710 --> 02:50:40.931
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

6658
02:50:40.931 --> 02:50:41.610
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

6659
02:50:41.610 --> 02:50:42.930
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing when I quit drinking,</v>

6660
02:50:42.931 --> 02:50:43.890
<v Speaker 3>I wanted more sugar.</v>

6661
02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:44.621
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

6662
02:50:44.621 --> 02:50:45.720
<v Speaker 3>he has one effect because I,</v>

6663
02:50:45.721 --> 02:50:47.160
<v Speaker 3>I've never had a sweet tooth really,</v>

6664
02:50:47.161 --> 02:50:47.640
<v Speaker 3>but one the,</v>

6665
02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:48.331
<v Speaker 3>when I quit drinking,</v>

6666
02:50:48.331 --> 02:50:50.400
<v Speaker 3>I suddenly was craving that chocolate.</v>

6667
02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:52.140
<v Speaker 3>Of course it makes sense.</v>

6668
02:50:52.440 --> 02:50:53.910
<v Speaker 3>I should go back to zero sugar.</v>

6669
02:50:53.911 --> 02:50:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I went zero sugar for a while and it felt amazing.</v>

6670
02:50:56.191 --> 02:50:57.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm just like a little tiny bits here and there.</v>

6671
02:50:58.260 --> 02:50:59.093
<v Speaker 3>Do you do zero?</v>

6672
02:50:59.160 --> 02:50:59.940
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

6673
02:50:59.940 --> 02:51:03.990
<v Speaker 3>I had dessert Saturday night and had a big old cake with ice cream on it after</v>

6674
02:51:03.991 --> 02:51:04.824
<v Speaker 3>dinner.</v>

6675
02:51:05.700 --> 02:51:10.700
<v Speaker 3>So no checker when a date with the wife at Mastro's we have this big fat steak</v>

6676
02:51:11.011 --> 02:51:14.310
<v Speaker 3>and then I got this butter cake with it sounds like ice cream and oh,</v>

6677
02:51:14.311 --> 02:51:14.911
<v Speaker 3>it was delicious.</v>

6678
02:51:14.911 --> 02:51:15.450
<v Speaker 3>That was great.</v>

6679
02:51:15.450 --> 02:51:16.283
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

6680
02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:17.693
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

6681
02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:18.690
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>

6682
02:51:18.690 --> 02:51:19.620
<v Speaker 3>That sounds amazing.</v>

6683
02:51:19.950 --> 02:51:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I say no to that.</v>

6684
02:51:20.760 --> 02:51:21.593
<v Speaker 3>That sounds amazing.</v>

6685
02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:23.220
<v Speaker 3>And occasionally you got to say fuck it,</v>

6686
02:51:24.430 --> 02:51:25.350
<v Speaker 3>but I just,</v>

6687
02:51:25.650 --> 02:51:26.580
<v Speaker 3>for the most part,</v>

6688
02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:28.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm on like an 80 20 diet.</v>

6689
02:51:28.530 --> 02:51:30.360
<v Speaker 3>80% of it is super healthy.</v>

6690
02:51:30.660 --> 02:51:32.910
<v Speaker 3>And then the 20% is occasionally I'm on Goff.</v>

6691
02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:33.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
