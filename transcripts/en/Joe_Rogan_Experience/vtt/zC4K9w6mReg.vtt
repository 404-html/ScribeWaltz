<v Speaker 1>Everybody else was looking to kill them.</v>

2
00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:08.251
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else is looking at take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people in this world just want to </v>

3
00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:10.450
<v Speaker 1>get by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to be healthy.</v>

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>They want to have children and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>those children be happy and want to get </v>

5
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>through the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to get through the fucking </v>

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.551
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are led by people who are </v>

7
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:20.551
<v Speaker 1>profiting off of the drama.</v>

8
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:23.800
<v Speaker 2>That's the real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why this podcast is so important</v>

9
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 2>and not to be melodramatic is to go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the success of this podcast and the </v>

10
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:34.261
<v Speaker 2>success of vice and all this stuff is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's because all of the other shit </v>

11
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:38.521
<v Speaker 2>out there is bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the whole thing is what happens </v>

12
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 2>in mainstream media and the news cycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>is crap and what's happening here and </v>

13
00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 2>the reason why you have so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to you and supporting you.</v>

14
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why vice is growing so </v>
<v Speaker 2>rapidly is because we're just regular </v>

15
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 2>dudes were regular guys just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 2>we like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like mma fighting me,</v>

17
00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 2>like having a few drinks with you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

18
00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 2>And you go out there in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

19
00:00:59.531 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the fucking rationality?</v>

20
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:07.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did these fuckers have nuclear </v>

21
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:07.591
<v Speaker 2>weapons?</v>

22
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Why the fuck is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the fucking world sinking?</v>

23
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 2>And we're not doing something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

24
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a Jesus on the cross.</v>

25
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to be that guy.</v>

26
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going out in the world and </v>
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>

27
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 2>holy fuck someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say it's the end of the world is </v>

28
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 2>because I went to cashmere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to the Indian side of cashmere.</v>

29
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.170
<v Speaker 2>The Indians said if we have another </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mumbai attack,</v>

30
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 2>we will attack Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I went to Pakistan.</v>

31
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.040
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you still sending these?</v>

32
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 2>You're training the ISI in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you still sending these guys in </v>

33
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 2>India?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've said that if you still,</v>

34
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:47.131
<v Speaker 2>if you send them in again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to attack you and they're </v>

35
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.131
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

36
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 2>because we're going to win and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

37
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to fucking win.</v>

38
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.300
<v Speaker 2>You're going to new kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all going to die.</v>

39
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I keep saying there,</v>

40
00:01:54.371 --> 00:01:55.990
<v Speaker 2>and it's the same thing in China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing.</v>

41
00:01:55.991 --> 00:02:00.991
<v Speaker 2>Even the funny shit that we do is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the absurdity of the modern </v>

42
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:05.311
<v Speaker 2>condition that's the world has become </v>
<v Speaker 2>insane and I'm saying where all the </v>

43
00:02:05.311 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 2>adults say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but where's the rationality?</v>

44
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Where's just two regular guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

45
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 2>we're just sitting here in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

46
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

47
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 2>in with a beautiful oak table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a few drinks and so many people </v>

48
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 2>are resonating with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're just two dudes talking.</v>

49
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is there's so many people,</v>

50
00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resonate,</v>

51
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:25.300
<v Speaker 2>resonate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>resonate.</v>

52
00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:30.301
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everyone just coming out of the </v>

53
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:30.301
<v Speaker 2>pond going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second,</v>

54
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:32.230
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck's going on?</v>

55
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.360
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all rational people.</v>

56
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:36.190
<v Speaker 2>We're all smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have the Internet.</v>

57
00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:36.880
<v Speaker 2>We use fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

58
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 2>all this shit's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on?</v>

59
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 2>And I think that the answers are </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying because you know what?</v>

60
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Nobody has an answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well it's just this,</v>

61
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:46.660
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

62
00:02:46.661 --> 00:02:51.661
<v Speaker 2>and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really going to happen because </v>

63
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:51.661
<v Speaker 2>it's that and it's just this guy doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

64
00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Brian Cowen for Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

65
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 2>is it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the regional thing,</v>

66
00:02:57.301 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times</v>

67
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.540
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>D,</v>

68
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.660
<v Speaker 1>refuted that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.220
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not true.</v>

70
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Like there is no rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer is more terrifying than the </v>

71
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.270
<v Speaker 2>question is why aren't they fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do they have nukes?</v>

72
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.540
<v Speaker 2>Because we gave them because we're crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're crazy because we so rushed</v>

73
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 3>now had money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They needed to nukes.</v>

74
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:16.020
<v Speaker 3>We hadn't needed money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

75
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 3>Chucka boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chucka boom.</v>

76
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.730
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what to stay scary real.</v>

77
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.690
<v Speaker 2>The real scary story is Canada had this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that can do reactor,</v>

78
00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:28.691
<v Speaker 2>the failsafe react to the most safe </v>
<v Speaker 2>reactor on her fucking beautiful </v>

79
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:31.661
<v Speaker 2>reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The titanic and reactors and Canada is </v>

80
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:31.661
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

81
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:32.390
<v Speaker 2>we're the largest donator of 48.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Canadian by the way,</v>

82
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.940
<v Speaker 2>and we're the largest foreign foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>donate as a foreign aid and then we gave</v>

83
00:03:37.941 --> 00:03:41.330
<v Speaker 2>the reactors to Pakistan and we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now whatever you do,</v>

84
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.570
<v Speaker 2>don't do anything bad with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

85
00:03:44.571 --> 00:03:45.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course not.</v>

86
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.870
<v Speaker 2>And you're sitting there going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

87
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.420
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck were you fucking thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada giving them fucking reactors.</v>

88
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.840
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck were you thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so silly.</v>

89
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 2>The reactive thing is a real freak out </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me and I talk about my act like I </v>

90
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.860
<v Speaker 2>don't know if I'm allowed to swear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

<v Speaker 3>These dudes go to the Congo and his </v>
<v Speaker 3>underwear.</v>

104
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.520

<v Speaker 2>it's going fucking crazy.</v>

110
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.200
<v Speaker 2>The only way I would go to the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was if someone absolutely showed me,</v>

111
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.360
<v Speaker 2>we're going to find the apes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see one of those eight giant.</v>

112
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.370
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Their podcasts are popular and it's,</v>

214
00:09:12.521 --> 00:09:16.690
<v Speaker 3>it's instead of you going through this </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional system of not being about </v>

215
00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:22.180
<v Speaker 3>the value of your contribution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but rather being about like who's hot </v>

<v Speaker 3>and who's not,</v>

00:10:17.391 --> 00:10:21.290
<v Speaker 2>the poor getting poorer and what we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do is bring back journalism in</v>

236
00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:26.291
<v Speaker 2>the sense that journalism is saying this</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit is fucked up and we collectively </v>

237
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.520
<v Speaker 2>have to solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you have kids.</v>

238
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:30.260
<v Speaker 2>I have kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our kids are gonna be fucked.</v>

239
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:35.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I run through these various scenarios in</v>

240
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:40.931
<v Speaker 3>my head about the future of humanity and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that gives me hope is the</v>

241
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.130
<v Speaker 3>access to ideas and information that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>available today.</v>

242
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Just for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I know about me with a phone,</v>

243
00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:54.850
<v Speaker 3>I can pretty much answer almost any </v>
<v Speaker 3>question I have about anything in the </v>

244
00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:58.820
<v Speaker 3>world and within a couple of hours of </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting there and reading shit,</v>

245
00:10:58.821 --> 00:10:59.760
<v Speaker 3>all you need is a goddamn.</v>

246
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:01.930
<v Speaker 2>You're a guy that doesn't have to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

247
00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to take your time out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to pay all this money to </v>

248
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>set this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much money?</v>

249
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

250
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.290
<v Speaker 2>It's fairly reasonable and it's hard and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's money and it's time of your day and</v>

251
00:11:11.291 --> 00:11:16.291
<v Speaker 2>you're setting up this shit by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More people should be doing it and more </v>

252
00:11:16.331 --> 00:11:17.890
<v Speaker 2>people should be doing shit because</v>

253
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.310
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

254
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.380
<v Speaker 3>the way I think about it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

255
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:23.390
<v Speaker 3>we were doing it at my house and then we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing it.</v>

256
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:27.680
<v Speaker 3>Brian's place that he set up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's quite studios in the ice house.</v>

257
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.840
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found out about it,</v>

258
00:11:29.841 --> 00:11:31.940
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I doing my shit in my house?</v>

259
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:32.680
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

260
00:11:32.681 --> 00:11:34.430
<v Speaker 3>let's take this to the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

261
00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:39.670
<v Speaker 3>So I was inspired by like Brian Putting </v>
<v Speaker 3>together this crazy studio that's using </v>

262
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.260
<v Speaker 3>it for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

263
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.320
<v Speaker 3>how long have been there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian?</v>

264
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a year anniversary month.</v>

265
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:45.810
<v Speaker 3>Bob Fisher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You beautiful motherfucker.</v>

266
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.160
<v Speaker 3>You the guy who owns that place is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>such a sweetie.</v>

267
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.120
<v Speaker 3>They're all sweeties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the wages are sweeties,</v>

268
00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:54.260
<v Speaker 3>but everybody's nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at what you built</v>

269
00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I've got to say everybody out there </v>

270
00:11:59.260 --> 00:11:59.390
<v Speaker 1>should take this as an example because </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody can do shit.</v>

271
00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

272
00:12:00.381 --> 00:12:01.640
<v Speaker 1>you're doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do shit.</v>

273
00:12:01.641 --> 00:12:02.600
<v Speaker 1>You're doing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

274
00:12:02.601 --> 00:12:07.601
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where I want to sort of </v>

275
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:08.350
<v Speaker 1>straightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I.</v>

276
00:12:08.351 --> 00:12:10.190
<v Speaker 1>it's not like I don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

277
00:12:10.191 --> 00:12:15.191
<v Speaker 1>there's no motivation to do this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>than joy other than fun other than the </v>

278
00:12:15.191 --> 00:12:17.810
<v Speaker 1>fact that I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love talking to guys like you.</v>

279
00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how else would I organize a three hour </v>

280
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>conversation with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

281
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.850
<v Speaker 1>the only way to make it enticing is I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fucking broadcast online to get </v>

282
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:29.960
<v Speaker 1>to meet someone like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like tomorrow we're doing that.</v>

283
00:12:29.961 --> 00:12:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John McAfee,</v>

284
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.910
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the virus guy who is,</v>

285
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in believes on the run.</v>

286
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 1>We're doing that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't get to talk to that guy in </v>

287
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 1>real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would he talk to me?</v>

288
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.710
<v Speaker 1>But you tell more truth here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

289
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Your podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then Msnbc and Fox put together.</v>

290
00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:49.250
<v Speaker 2>And I've got to say that's the future of</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalism,</v>

291
00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:49.800
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

292
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.170
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's people,</v>

293
00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:56.171
<v Speaker 2>regular people like you and me who </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually give a shit and who have </v>

294
00:12:56.171 --> 00:12:57.330
<v Speaker 2>actually learned stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because you go around the world</v>

295
00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.370
<v Speaker 1>and UC Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go around the world and should we see </v>

296
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:02.370
<v Speaker 1>this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we go,</v>

297
00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is ridiculous.</v>

298
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change is incredibly difficult,</v>

299
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 1>incredibly difficult for people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

300
00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly difficult for systems of</v>
<v Speaker 1>government or systems monitoring systems</v>

301
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:17.851
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Change is incredibly hard and resisted </v>

302
00:13:17.851 --> 00:13:21.061
<v Speaker 1>tooth and claw and the people that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in Msnbc and CNN and all these </v>

303
00:13:22.301 --> 00:13:27.301
<v Speaker 1>people that perpetrate all this nonsense</v>
<v Speaker 1>journals and I don't fault them,</v>

304
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't because as a guy who's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

305
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.440
<v Speaker 1>this is my position as a guy who's been </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the system of television before.</v>

306
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I've been on two different TV shows that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on a sitcom for five years,</v>

307
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.360
<v Speaker 1>and then I was on fear factor for six </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

308
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.840
<v Speaker 1>I kind of see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a pretty good view of the whole</v>

309
00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:47.230
<v Speaker 1>system of creating things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

310
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:52.650
<v Speaker 1>It's insurmountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It either has to collapse or be absorbed</v>

311
00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:55.660
<v Speaker 1>by the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the only options,</v>

312
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.630
<v Speaker 1>but it as it stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bureaucratic.</v>

313
00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:01.330
<v Speaker 1>There's too many people involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much decision making.</v>

314
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too different.</v>

315
00:14:02.641 --> 00:14:05.980
<v Speaker 1>It's too expensive and difficult to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>together a fucking Sitcom.</v>

316
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:08.030
<v Speaker 1>If</v>

317
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:11.130
<v Speaker 2>you look at your audience and you look </v>
<v Speaker 2>at what you're doing and,</v>

318
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:16.270
<v Speaker 2>and other people like you are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have millions and millions of </v>

319
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:16.550
<v Speaker 2>followers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say this,</v>

320
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.570
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

321
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.330
<v Speaker 2>you have as many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

322
00:14:20.331 --> 00:14:21.610
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

323
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>you have an audience that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>willing to do shit and willing to </v>

324
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.430
<v Speaker 2>participate and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

325
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.511
<v Speaker 2>they tweet and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the facebook and then get on the </v>

326
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:32.150
<v Speaker 2>socials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would say this is like,</v>

327
00:14:32.151 --> 00:14:35.240
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an aging at 67,</v>

328
00:14:35.241 --> 00:14:40.241
<v Speaker 2>68,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people are dying and you're going </v>

329
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:40.241
<v Speaker 2>to die out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the future.</v>

330
00:14:40.241 --> 00:14:44.720
<v Speaker 2>And what you're doing is you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to put my flag in the sand and</v>

331
00:14:44.721 --> 00:14:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

332
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have you been in TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been successful.</v>

333
00:14:48.471 --> 00:14:50.090
<v Speaker 2>You're still on TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still successful.</v>

334
00:14:50.091 --> 00:14:50.630
<v Speaker 2>You're killing it.</v>

335
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.410
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet still,</v>

336
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.810
<v Speaker 2>you'll take your time out of your day to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come here and say,</v>

337
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.240
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to do some funny stuff.</v>

338
00:14:57.241 --> 00:14:58.860
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna do some regular stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna do this and that.</v>

339
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.370
<v Speaker 2>But we're going to try to fucking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least say,</v>

340
00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:04.350
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's going on with mcafee.</v>

341
00:15:04.351 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 2>This is what's going on in Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is going on.</v>

342
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:07.680
<v Speaker 2>Whenever you have me on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have other people on.</v>

343
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.420
<v Speaker 2>And I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

344
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:14.450
<v Speaker 2>that is the future of journalism because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the only way today that we're </v>

345
00:15:14.851 --> 00:15:15.690
<v Speaker 2>going to get to the truth.</v>

346
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

347
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with everything you just said.</v>

348
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.670
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why do it is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like you are out there.</v>

349
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.880
<v Speaker 1>The reason why I'm so committed to doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a podcast like this and the reason why </v>

350
00:15:28.951 --> 00:15:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Brian and are committed to keeping them </v>
<v Speaker 1>free is we,</v>

351
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:38.080
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we benefit from it just as much as </v>

352
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.361
<v Speaker 1>everyone else does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We benefit from it from our own </v>

353
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:41.361
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

354
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Brian and I were just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation theory today,</v>

355
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:43.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

356
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.760
<v Speaker 1>and it's because it's brought up by so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many brilliant people in the podcast </v>

357
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:48.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.990
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had these like freaky discussions </v>

359
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:52.990
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

360
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.660
<v Speaker 1>this podcast has been an incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing.</v>

361
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't ever take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only can I,</v>

362
00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel like I can take any </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for it.</v>

363
00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't take any accolades for it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because all it is,</v>

364
00:16:03.461 --> 00:16:04.430
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

365
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.160
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

366
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

367
00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:07.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like completely like a conduit.</v>

368
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And I feel like if I can tune into guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you or had less trout on last year,</v>

369
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.010
<v Speaker 1>last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>survivor man,</v>

370
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had Alex Grey,</v>

371
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:22.070
<v Speaker 1>the brilliant visionary artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can get a forum where these people </v>

372
00:16:22.321 --> 00:16:27.321
<v Speaker 1>can talk through the Internet and reach </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these other people like I who else </v>

373
00:16:28.081 --> 00:16:29.890
<v Speaker 1>has that opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also you had it,</v>

374
00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:31.500
<v Speaker 1>you would do it if anybody else had </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

375
00:16:31.501 --> 00:16:36.501
<v Speaker 1>They would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're thinking in your right mind </v>

376
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:37.080
<v Speaker 1>and you had a million people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention or whatever the fuck it</v>

377
00:16:37.081 --> 00:16:41.580
<v Speaker 1>is now and you knew some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd want to tell people some shit.</v>

378
00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.000
<v Speaker 2>But I'm allowed to say it's admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And listen,</v>

379
00:16:45.001 --> 00:16:50.001
<v Speaker 2>that's not nearly as admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're chilling here in the fucking </v>

380
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:53.091
<v Speaker 2>valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian and I are in the air condition </v>

381
00:16:53.091 --> 00:16:53.820
<v Speaker 2>studio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're out there and Mumbai to out there</v>

382
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.850
<v Speaker 2>and I'd like to say is life is good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

383
00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.420
<v Speaker 2>In our life has been good and we got to </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of get out of jail free card.</v>

384
00:17:00.421 --> 00:17:03.810
<v Speaker 2>When I got out of college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to say I'm never going to live in</v>

385
00:17:03.811 --> 00:17:07.830
<v Speaker 2>a house as nice as my parents or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or drive a car is nice to my parents and</v>

386
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.640
<v Speaker 2>gen x generation sort of got to get out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of jail free card,</v>

387
00:17:11.641 --> 00:17:15.120
<v Speaker 2>but Gen y is going to have to pay the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bill and you know,</v>

388
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

389
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.800
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so saying,</v>

390
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.460
<v Speaker 2>I think it's our responsibility to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>we know the fucking problems.</v>

391
00:17:20.461 --> 00:17:25.461
<v Speaker 2>We know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know that this is a fucking problem </v>

392
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:26.190
<v Speaker 2>and we have to go out there and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

393
00:17:26.191 --> 00:17:27.990
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the solutions.</v>

394
00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:29.400
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not Jesus on the cross,</v>

395
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.490
<v Speaker 2>but at least people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why.</v>

396
00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:37.500
<v Speaker 2>This is what gives me hope is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people fundamentally I believe are good.</v>

397
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.800
<v Speaker 2>And I also believe people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally smart and people </v>

398
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:42.810
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally want to do the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

399
00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people fundamentally want to be </v>

400
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:47.880
<v Speaker 1>good because love fields better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate.</v>

401
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Like if I have a little tiny dispute</v>

402
00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:51.880
<v Speaker 3>in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about you,</v>

403
00:17:51.881 --> 00:17:56.881
<v Speaker 3>but the way I feel about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if like amongst my circle of </v>

404
00:17:56.881 --> 00:17:58.120
<v Speaker 3>friends or amongst people I do business </v>
<v Speaker 3>with or work with,</v>

405
00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.960
<v Speaker 3>if there's any sort of a tiny dispute,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a ripple in my force and I don't</v>

406
00:18:01.961 --> 00:18:06.961
<v Speaker 3>like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like that feeling and I want to </v>

407
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.050
<v Speaker 3>resolve it is lovingly and as kindly and</v>
<v Speaker 3>as apologetically as I can.</v>

408
00:18:08.051 --> 00:18:13.051
<v Speaker 3>I always feel like that and some people </v>
<v Speaker 3>never get to a position where they </v>

409
00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:18.091
<v Speaker 3>really feel at peace with their place in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world and how they interact with </v>

410
00:18:18.091 --> 00:18:18.610
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't.</v>

411
00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's because they're too in debt</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they're in a fucking terrible </v>

412
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.520
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood or they grew up with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy mother.</v>

413
00:18:24.670 --> 00:18:27.550
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You took a bad career path,</v>

414
00:18:27.551 --> 00:18:32.551
<v Speaker 3>stuck in a fucking abusive job position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the fuck it is that locks you </v>

415
00:18:32.551 --> 00:18:33.550
<v Speaker 3>into your reality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your existence.</v>

416
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.960
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult for people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a torturous position to look at </v>

417
00:18:40.751 --> 00:18:45.751
<v Speaker 3>possibilities and options and to look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the possibility and options that this </v>

418
00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:48.460
<v Speaker 3>might not be the correct way to live </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and that in reality,</v>

419
00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:53.461
<v Speaker 3>my narrow minded view has sent me on </v>
<v Speaker 3>this insurmountable path of ultimate </v>

420
00:18:53.951 --> 00:18:58.951
<v Speaker 3>failure and there's no way to accumulate</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough shit in this life if you're a </v>

421
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:00.100
<v Speaker 3>temporary being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no way.</v>

422
00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.590
<v Speaker 3>So if that is a focus of your existence </v>
<v Speaker 3>to accumulate,</v>

423
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.700
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean you shouldn't enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>some shit.</v>

424
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean you shouldn't like get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking Samsung Galaxy s three and go </v>

425
00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all that shit's bad ass too.</v>

426
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:12.480
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

427
00:19:12.481 --> 00:19:17.481
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality of like something like when </v>

428
00:19:17.481 --> 00:19:17.481
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you hear people talk about,</v>

429
00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 3>I was having a conversation with someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they started talking about the law </v>

430
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 3>of attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

431
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:22.960
<v Speaker 3>it's the law of attraction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You bring it into your life.</v>

432
00:19:22.961 --> 00:19:23.990
<v Speaker 3>It's the law of attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

433
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:28.620
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe babies die and drive bys too.</v>

434
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:33.650
<v Speaker 1>Like what's real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's realistic is let's look at this </v>

435
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.230
<v Speaker 1>whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality that we exist in.</v>

436
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be honest about it and say we woke </v>

437
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:42.870
<v Speaker 1>up in the middle of a dream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

438
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.310
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American,</v>

439
00:19:44.311 --> 00:19:49.311
<v Speaker 1>the whoever the fuck you are with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese man who 50 years old who wakes </v>

440
00:19:49.861 --> 00:19:52.470
<v Speaker 1>up and his alarm clock goes off today </v>
<v Speaker 1>and looked at this world.</v>

441
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.010
<v Speaker 1>This world woke up in motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people,</v>

442
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.540
<v Speaker 1>there's too many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

443
00:19:57.541 --> 00:20:00.540
<v Speaker 1>there's too many of them to ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate that no one can.</v>

444
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 1>No one understands what I fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody saying.</v>

445
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:07.510
<v Speaker 1>There's too many different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no universal acknowledgement of </v>

446
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:11.721
<v Speaker 1>our plight and we are headed to doom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately.</v>

447
00:20:11.761 --> 00:20:16.761
<v Speaker 1>There's no way if we continue along a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain path that it doesn't completely </v>

448
00:20:16.861 --> 00:20:21.861
<v Speaker 1>exploded in our face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's overpopulation or whether </v>

449
00:20:21.861 --> 00:20:24.951
<v Speaker 1>it's pollution or nuclear disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of stops along </v>

450
00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:28.050
<v Speaker 1>the way until the whole thing ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

451
00:20:28.051 --> 00:20:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I think I agree with you and I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our generation,</v>

452
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 1>yours and mine has come out of the pond </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've had a good life and I love.</v>

453
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I love this country because I came down </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and build your country better.</v>

454
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.510
<v Speaker 1>I know I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Shit hits the fan.</v>

455
00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving to Canada for fucking sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care if it's Montreal.</v>

456
00:20:46.171 --> 00:20:47.710
<v Speaker 1>I'll deal with that snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it.</v>

457
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Toronto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll get a snowblower in the warm coat,</v>

458
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.780
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is is you sit there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

459
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:55.780
<v Speaker 2>we came out of the pond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We realized that shit is happening.</v>

460
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to live a good life.</v>

461
00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I want shit to get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precisely because I've had such a good </v>

462
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.370
<v Speaker 2>life and I'm not a doom and gloom guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a party guy liked to drink.</v>

463
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.140
<v Speaker 2>I like to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to eat.</v>

464
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:13.170
<v Speaker 2>I like to do stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to learn or to go to all these </v>

465
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:13.300
<v Speaker 2>different places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I'm like,</v>

466
00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

467
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 2>These guys want to nuke each other or </v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on the world to sinking or hey,</v>

468
00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This shit's happening.</v>

469
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:24.871
<v Speaker 2>This is going to fuck everybody up is </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I like my life is because I like</v>

470
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:28.930
<v Speaker 2>guys like us because I like where we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotten to date.</v>

471
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.380
<v Speaker 2>The problem with it is is that you sit </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and you say,</v>

472
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:37.381
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want the next generation to not </v>

473
00:21:37.381 --> 00:21:38.320
<v Speaker 2>have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not be able to go outside,</v>

474
00:21:38.321 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 2>swimming the river,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go fishing and do all that stuff and and</v>

475
00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:41.890
<v Speaker 2>bright.</v>

476
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Now we're at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're at literally just sort of breaking</v>

477
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:47.180
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're at that inflection point of,</v>

478
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.070
<v Speaker 2>of we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can fix it,</v>

479
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 2>we can solve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're smart,</v>

480
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:53.980
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to do it,</v>

481
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.700
<v Speaker 2>and if you follow this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you do.</v>

482
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.890
<v Speaker 2>The people who follow you and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

483
00:21:59.891 --> 00:22:04.891
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at what they say on </v>

484
00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:04.891
<v Speaker 2>twitter and you look at what they say on</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>

485
00:22:04.891 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 2>people are fucking angry and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>down and they're happy.</v>

486
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:09.490
<v Speaker 2>He want to do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not ready.</v>

487
00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:11.140
<v Speaker 2>They're not represented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the thing is,</v>

488
00:22:11.141 --> 00:22:13.420
<v Speaker 2>is what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially globally,</v>

489
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.480
<v Speaker 2>let alone in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's happening globally is that </v>

490
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.711
<v Speaker 2>the people with the power or </v>
<v Speaker 2>disenfranchised because the systems that</v>

491
00:22:23.021 --> 00:22:28.021
<v Speaker 2>are in place are set up as such,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can't be represented.</v>

492
00:22:28.031 --> 00:22:32.620
<v Speaker 2>So what this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this is true grassroots democracy.</v>

493
00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.740
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope to God it continues and gets </v>

494
00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:38.590
<v Speaker 2>bigger and bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was making a joke earlier,</v>

495
00:22:38.591 --> 00:22:40.690
<v Speaker 2>this is the first podcast from here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

496
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to look back 20 years from now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and say this was the first podcast that </v>

497
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 2>changed the world because this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>root of journalism,</v>

498
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:49.090
<v Speaker 2>which is the root of democracy.</v>

499
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the people that are in the </v>

500
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:55.730
<v Speaker 1>position of power that are doing these </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible things,</v>

501
00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:00.260
<v Speaker 1>we really need to figure out how to heal</v>
<v Speaker 1>those motherfuckers.</v>

502
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I think we have to figure out how to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>them the fuck out.</v>

503
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.660
<v Speaker 1>You got to get them the fuck out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also get them the fuck out.</v>

504
00:23:06.661 --> 00:23:09.780
<v Speaker 1>We got to discourage that type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior in the future.</v>

505
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be a real hippie and a </v>

506
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:19.940
<v Speaker 1>total idealist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would say that there's gotta be a </v>

507
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.271
<v Speaker 1>way that almost everybody can change and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that these people that are in this </v>

508
00:23:23.271 --> 00:23:26.630
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these positions of power that are </v>

509
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:29.060
<v Speaker 1>looking at things like war and economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks on countries embargoes or all </v>

510
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:36.330
<v Speaker 1>these different various things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people do that really can cause </v>

511
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.530
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable irreparable harm to </v>
<v Speaker 1>communities and families and like,</v>

512
00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:41.640
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to figure out a way to get those</v>

513
00:23:41.641 --> 00:23:43.860
<v Speaker 1>people to look at things differently and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

514
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:49.130
<v Speaker 1>your motivation is off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your motivation is based on many shitty </v>

515
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:53.860
<v Speaker 1>primate shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's based on some ancient primate shit </v>

516
00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.400
<v Speaker 1>while you were running away from Jaguars</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you had to be the most vicious </v>

517
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.290
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker to survive and that stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself today.</v>

518
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Millions of years later in the male </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance mentality and that mentality </v>

519
00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.530
<v Speaker 1>is not best suited for attacks against </v>
<v Speaker 1>your fellow man and it can be conquered.</v>

520
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:11.210
<v Speaker 1>It can be conquered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be understood.</v>

521
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.920
<v Speaker 1>It can be understood in your mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will be happier person if you do not</v>

522
00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:19.610
<v Speaker 1>behave in that manner and you won't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>any happier if you get more money.</v>

523
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a certain amount of money where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter.</v>

524
00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

525
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I've got to say also that if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and say I want real people.</v>

526
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I want people like me who have had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drink too many,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not a robot.</v>

533
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm flawed and fucked up and I've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>through crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well see,</v>

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.240
<v Speaker 1>to increase harmony,</v>

547
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.720
<v Speaker 2>to spread the love to use as you were </v>

<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

554
00:25:42.421 --> 00:25:43.830
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was in Pakistan,</v>

555

<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

00:26:48.031 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

577
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you I lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do this.</v>

578
00:26:51.451 --> 00:26:53.490
<v Speaker 2>I have two of the most popular channels </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Youtube.</v>

579
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 2>People just upload shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just fucking happens.</v>

580
00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 2>It's not like government policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not propaganda.</v>

581
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:02.190
<v Speaker 2>It's not this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that they don't fucking get it.</v>

582
00:27:02.191 --> 00:27:05.100
<v Speaker 2>And if you just actually just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look dude,</v>

583
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.280
<v Speaker 2>here's the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the reality of the situation,</v>

584
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:13.430
<v Speaker 2>which no buddy does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole fucked up thing is </v>

585
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.930
<v Speaker 2>nobody sits there and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually what happens.</v>

586
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.620
<v Speaker 2>This is the truth.</v>

587
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:18.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not saying you're incorrect.</v>

588
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's you,</v>

589
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.900
<v Speaker 3>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your motherfucker.</v>

590
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.880
<v Speaker 3>Y'All fucking channel does it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>

591
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.980
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's guys like you,</v>

592
00:27:25.981 --> 00:27:30.981
<v Speaker 3>there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the congressmen that are coming </v>

593
00:27:30.981 --> 00:27:30.981
<v Speaker 3>up like Daniel Seaman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the congressional representative,</v>

594
00:27:30.981 --> 00:27:35.460
<v Speaker 3>or a candidate rather who is completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>honest and well read.</v>

595
00:27:35.461 --> 00:27:36.710
<v Speaker 3>And the young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

596
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.720
<v Speaker 3>there's a whole group of people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming up now.</v>

597
00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.840
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>broadcasting,</v>

598
00:27:42.841 --> 00:27:44.760
<v Speaker 3>whether it's the young Turks or whether </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

599
00:27:44.761 --> 00:27:45.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

600
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.200
<v Speaker 3>any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a number,</v>

601
00:27:46.201 --> 00:27:49.050
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Alex Jones to a large extent,</v>

602
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:54.051
<v Speaker 3>a lot of what Alex Jones says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although absolutely ridiculed in the 19 </v>

603
00:27:54.051 --> 00:27:56.130
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows to be true in 2012.</v>

604
00:27:56.131 --> 00:28:01.131
<v Speaker 3>I've been Alex's friend for a long </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking time and a lot of people think </v>

605
00:28:01.131 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 3>he's crazy and he's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why they think he's crazy.</v>

606
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.320
<v Speaker 3>But he's crazy in a beautiful way.</v>

607
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.650
<v Speaker 3>And he's right a lot of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's sort of,</v>

608
00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:13.190
<v Speaker 3>that's sort of understood now and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's enough information now that </v>

609
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:14.370
<v Speaker 3>people have their head collectively </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocked sideways.</v>

610
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.420
<v Speaker 3>I think the whole United States is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

611
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:23.570
<v Speaker 3>there's something I tweeted yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 3>that someone tweeted me and I've read </v>

612
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.571
<v Speaker 3>tweeted it was 33 different conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 3>theories that turned out to be correct.</v>

613
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 3>And when you go and look at them and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

614
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.330
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

615
00:28:30.331 --> 00:28:33.090
<v Speaker 3>this is just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is sort of how it's always been.</v>

616
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:38.270
<v Speaker 3>So what we have to do is figuring out </v>
<v Speaker 3>how to get these people that are </v>

617
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 3>thinking this way and this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>position of power where they,</v>

618
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:45.860
<v Speaker 3>whatever group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however many agree to do something </v>

619
00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.910
<v Speaker 3>totally a moral and for profit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess that's really the only real </v>

620
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:50.310
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever it comes down to it,</v>

621
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:55.820
<v Speaker 3>we have to figure out how to reach </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like that and to let them know </v>

622
00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:59.511
<v Speaker 3>that this is a false pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mind is locked in some nonsensical </v>

623
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:05.931
<v Speaker 3>thinking that is based on the predatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>instincts of animals that had to survive</v>

624
00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:11.160
<v Speaker 3>from fucking cougars and Jaguars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bears and shit.</v>

625
00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:16.370
<v Speaker 3>There was a ruthlessness that's designed</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the DNA to make sure that the </v>

626
00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:21.351
<v Speaker 3>animal procreates and that can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>overcome and that we have to understand </v>

627
00:29:21.351 --> 00:29:25.821
<v Speaker 3>that the only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only way to true happiness is to </v>

628
00:29:25.821 --> 00:29:28.551
<v Speaker 3>look at each other collectively as if </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's us living another life and you look</v>

629
00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:31.410
<v Speaker 3>at every person you meet because if it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>you living with,</v>

630
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.110
<v Speaker 2>but also just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

631
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:33.770
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

632
00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you 100 percent because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounds like hippie.</v>

633
00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:36.960
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

634
00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:37.480
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

635
00:29:37.481 --> 00:29:38.890
<v Speaker 2>but you look at you and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

636
00:29:38.891 --> 00:29:40.390
<v Speaker 2>here's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:42.580
<v Speaker 2>ufc came up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taekwondo,</v>

638
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.980
<v Speaker 2>Chevy's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fighting guy.</v>

639
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:48.990
<v Speaker 2>You know all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously we're two guys here sitting </v>

640
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:48.990
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not hippies.</v>

641
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.610
<v Speaker 2>But what we're coming to is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is saying,</v>

642
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.780
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we came up,</v>

643
00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.850
<v Speaker 2>we came up hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we fought,</v>

644
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:57.760
<v Speaker 2>we did all this stuff and now we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>realizing this shit.</v>

645
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:58.840
<v Speaker 2>And we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

646
00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:01.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen this.</v>

647
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:06.660
<v Speaker 2>We've learned from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why to go back to it is I don't </v>

648
00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.060
<v Speaker 2>want politicians representing me who </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand this.</v>

649
00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is I came up hard.</v>

650
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.130
<v Speaker 2>I came up from the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned this shit,</v>

651
00:30:15.131 --> 00:30:20.131
<v Speaker 2>I learned that the hard way by going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these places and what I've realized is </v>

652
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:25.290
<v Speaker 2>exactly what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is unless we've overcome our base </v>

653
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:26.590
<v Speaker 2>desire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I hate you,</v>

654
00:30:26.591 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fucking bomb you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all dead.</v>

655
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.750
<v Speaker 2>We're all dead because now it's not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>knife.</v>

656
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.240
<v Speaker 2>It's not a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not an RPG.</v>

657
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a new kid or fucking warhead.</v>

658
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.080
<v Speaker 2>And when we start fucking trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking be alpha male with a nuclear </v>

659
00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.430
<v Speaker 2>warhead like Achy Yukon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're fucking.</v>

660
00:30:45.431 --> 00:30:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Where's that guy is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still alive.</v>

661
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.650
<v Speaker 2>He's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still alive.</v>

662
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:55.140
<v Speaker 2>He's in Pakistan Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's the reason why there's the </v>

663
00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.170
<v Speaker 2>proliferation of nuclear fucking.</v>

664
00:30:56.250 --> 00:31:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Does he have technology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 bitches around him just dancing in </v>

665
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.340
<v Speaker 1>their underwear at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think so,</v>

666
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.030
<v Speaker 1>but no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be a fucking man with it.</v>

667
00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:09.190
<v Speaker 1>At least if you've got to be at concord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a fucking old school cafe.</v>

668
00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:14.040
<v Speaker 2>He has a bunch of Isi guys around him at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all times because those guys,</v>

669
00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:19.130
<v Speaker 2>those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the ISI is the CIA of Pakistan and </v>

670
00:31:19.471 --> 00:31:24.471
<v Speaker 2>they started the Taliban and they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guys who are basically running </v>

671
00:31:24.471 --> 00:31:28.041
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan and they are the guys who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming increasingly radicalized and </v>

672
00:31:28.041 --> 00:31:29.100
<v Speaker 2>they're the guys who were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are going to bomb India,</v>

673
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:36.810
<v Speaker 2>needed to get those people on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we need to do is just say,</v>

674
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.070
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to blow up the world.</v>

675
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.660
<v Speaker 2>You cannot do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

676
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.270
<v Speaker 2>if we had politicians who were doing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right thing,</v>

677
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:50.480
<v Speaker 2>you would go to India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Pakistan and say you're not </v>

678
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:53.511
<v Speaker 2>allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which means that we have to say Russia </v>

679
00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:53.511
<v Speaker 2>is not allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not allowed.</v>

680
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because again,</v>

681
00:31:55.141 --> 00:32:00.141
<v Speaker 2>to go back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're playing roulette and double </v>

682
00:32:00.141 --> 00:32:02.370
<v Speaker 2>zero means the end of the fucking world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be playing fucking relax.</v>

683
00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 2>And so take that double zero off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking</v>

684
00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.670
<v Speaker 1>board police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're playing Russian roulette,</v>

685
00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.700
<v Speaker 1>you have five chances to not get shot in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head when you're playing world </v>

686
00:32:14.701 --> 00:32:19.701
<v Speaker 1>dominance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how many opportunities you </v>

687
00:32:19.701 --> 00:32:19.701
<v Speaker 1>have to start a nuclear war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

688
00:32:19.701 --> 00:32:21.800
<v Speaker 1>It's really not a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a question of,</v>

689
00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.880
<v Speaker 1>of when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a question of when.</v>

690
00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a whole lot of chambers.</v>

691
00:32:25.831 --> 00:32:30.831
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole thing is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous because it's people locked up</v>

692
00:32:31.171 --> 00:32:36.171
<v Speaker 1>in this idea that somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 1>conquering makes things better and then </v>

693
00:32:36.171 --> 00:32:39.800
<v Speaker 1>somehow under the controlling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources makes things better.</v>

694
00:32:39.801 --> 00:32:44.801
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all these observations now from </v>

695
00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:44.801
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

696
00:32:44.801 --> 00:32:47.990
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to what's going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan about minerals,</v>

697
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.320
<v Speaker 1>minerals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how long they've known that </v>

698
00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.661
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an incredible deposit and mineral </v>

699
00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:55.661
<v Speaker 1>minerals from Congo.</v>

700
00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>

701
00:32:56.741 --> 00:33:01.741
<v Speaker 2>What's happening now in the Congo is 100</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent due to Colton.</v>

702
00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.840
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't be fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't have all the money,</v>

703
00:33:04.841 --> 00:33:07.030
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't have tram Colton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colton.</v>

704
00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Colton is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a rarer thing wrong that makes all </v>

705
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.020
<v Speaker 2>your iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your Samsung,</v>

706
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.320
<v Speaker 2>your ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all need Colton,</v>

707
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually work.</v>

708
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:24.340
<v Speaker 2>And the majority of Colton actually is </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Congo.</v>

709
00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:29.050
<v Speaker 2>And so what's happened now is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>continual warfare,</v>

710
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

711
00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.690
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe now the sixth bloodiest war in</v>

712
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:36.370
<v Speaker 2>the history of humanity is all happening</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of ipads,</v>

713
00:33:36.371 --> 00:33:37.540
<v Speaker 2>iphones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>samsungs,</v>

714
00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.610
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're buying them.</v>

715
00:33:39.611 --> 00:33:41.410
<v Speaker 2>This is the whole thing were </v>
<v Speaker 2>disconnected.</v>

716
00:33:41.411 --> 00:33:42.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I grew up thinking,</v>

717
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:44.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever happens in Africa,</v>

718
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.460
<v Speaker 2>in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's their problem,</v>

719
00:33:45.461 --> 00:33:47.260
<v Speaker 2>not my problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you realize,</v>

720
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:52.290
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fucking war is happening because I </v>

721
00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.290
<v Speaker 2>have an iphone five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

722
00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.720
<v Speaker 2>that's the reality of the situation.</v>

723
00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.570
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of analogous to the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

724
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:03.350
<v Speaker 1>If you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

725
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:06.770
<v Speaker 1>that sounds gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippie and gay at the same time.</v>

726
00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:10.240
<v Speaker 1>So we're really having a love fest to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up a confused dude</v>

727
00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:11.660
<v Speaker 2>in the new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the new</v>

728
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.060
<v Speaker 1>studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human.</v>

729
00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:18.340
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the human experience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at where we're at right now at </v>

730
00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:23.431
<v Speaker 1>the highest levels and let's perceive at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest levels are innovation and </v>

731
00:34:23.431 --> 00:34:27.331
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that the fact that we can broadcast </v>

732
00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:30.121
<v Speaker 1>this with minimal cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's kind of sucking right </v>

733
00:34:30.121 --> 00:34:30.690
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful att and t the.</v>

734
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Why'd you get DSL?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

735
00:34:33.461 --> 00:34:34.570
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a fucking.</v>

736
00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Who did this manager handle this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

737
00:34:36.171 --> 00:34:38.030
<v Speaker 1>does this business manager?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

738
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.100
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never met him.</v>

739
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a young kid do that shit.</v>

740
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I got shit I need to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not one of them.</v>

741
00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.830
<v Speaker 1>You've thrown me off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where was I?</v>

742
00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Minerals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything Metro's earlier.</v>

743
00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the.</v>

744
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Is it important that I finished my </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence?</v>

745
00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.600
<v Speaker 1>I have nothing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen of grandstanding.</v>

746
00:34:58.601 --> 00:35:03.601
<v Speaker 1>Clearly I'm trying to somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>project project better ideas through </v>

747
00:35:04.451 --> 00:35:09.451
<v Speaker 1>whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three whiskey and marijuana allegedly </v>

748
00:35:09.451 --> 00:35:12.730
<v Speaker 1>allegedly don't think it's necessarily a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad thing.</v>

749
00:35:12.731 --> 00:35:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounded like Colin Quinn there.</v>

750
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.120
<v Speaker 2>You've got to irrigate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

751
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.570
<v Speaker 2>irrigate the mine.</v>

752
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>

753
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 1>People don't drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been drunk.</v>

754
00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't really like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nor do I trust you.</v>

755
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:25.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest.</v>

756
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I trust drunks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even trust dry drunks.</v>

757
00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I trust her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just saying that because I'm here.</v>

758
00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

759
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

760
00:35:31.731 --> 00:35:32.390
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

761
00:35:32.391 --> 00:35:34.970
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate sober people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

762
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 1>but if you have not a least experienced </v>
<v Speaker 1>whiskey with all the people raving about</v>

763
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:44.541
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you not dive in the water so at </v>

764
00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:44.541
<v Speaker 1>least once?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How stubborn are you?</v>

765
00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:46.650
<v Speaker 1>You've never had a drop of alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you partying with?</v>

766
00:35:46.651 --> 00:35:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ridiculous.</v>

767
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 1>If your friends have kept you from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop of alcohol,</v>

768
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 1>they're assholes.</v>

769
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.350
<v Speaker 2>It's usually people that have had too </v>
<v Speaker 2>many drops of alcohol.</v>

770
00:35:55.351 --> 00:35:57.280
<v Speaker 2>It seems like everyone I know is in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour.</v>

771
00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

772
00:35:58.631 --> 00:36:03.631
<v Speaker 1>The issue is slightly biological and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I'm willing to </v>

773
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:05.020
<v Speaker 1>admit 100 percent because I have friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I trust dearly,</v>

774
00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.890
<v Speaker 1>like Fitzsimmons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg Fitzsimmons is greg and I have been</v>

775
00:36:08.891 --> 00:36:11.740
<v Speaker 1>friends since we were in our early </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties.</v>

776
00:36:11.741 --> 00:36:16.741
<v Speaker 1>I think we met when I was 21 and Greg </v>
<v Speaker 1>was probably the same age greg has </v>

777
00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:17.650
<v Speaker 1>always had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

778
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:22.540
<v Speaker 1>He's a legit alcoholic and it's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of he could have a drink today and</v>

779
00:36:22.541 --> 00:36:25.210
<v Speaker 1>he could be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there will be a pole,</v>

780
00:36:25.211 --> 00:36:29.680
<v Speaker 1>a biological pool that's reinforced by </v>
<v Speaker 1>his relatives.</v>

781
00:36:29.681 --> 00:36:34.681
<v Speaker 1>It's reinforced by generations and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have many friends that have this issue </v>

782
00:36:34.681 --> 00:36:36.670
<v Speaker 1>and I do not discount it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Tate Fletcher,</v>

783
00:36:36.671 --> 00:36:39.550
<v Speaker 1>he's a brilliant guy and tate has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with substances.</v>

784
00:36:39.551 --> 00:36:40.870
<v Speaker 1>He cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

785
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.650
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

786
00:36:41.651 --> 00:36:43.930
<v Speaker 1>could you even like take a look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a baby hit of a joint?</v>

787
00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:49.110
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe or I could wake up in an alleyway </v>

788
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 1>naked and not know what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and I'm not willing to make </v>

789
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:52.840
<v Speaker 1>that jump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not willing to take that chance.</v>

790
00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.650
<v Speaker 1>There's biological weirdness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People fucking get.</v>

791
00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:59.380
<v Speaker 1>They die from peanuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

792
00:36:59.381 --> 00:37:01.510
<v Speaker 1>A person can be allergic to peanuts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

793
00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:06.550
<v Speaker 1>I would never discount that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that generally speaking,</v>

794
00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:12.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a mentality of non chance taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring bullshit that comes with the.</v>

795
00:37:14.861 --> 00:37:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I've never had a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>

796
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a few examples that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary,</v>

797
00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:24.541
<v Speaker 1>like Penn Jillette has never had a drop </v>
<v Speaker 1>of alcohol and the only time he's ever </v>

798
00:37:24.541 --> 00:37:27.010
<v Speaker 1>had any sort of medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been injured after surgery,</v>

799
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:28.540
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a painkiller,</v>

800
00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.520
<v Speaker 1>but he's a brilliant guy and I love </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to him.</v>

801
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the rare examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people that have never even been </v>

802
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.550
<v Speaker 1>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never.</v>

803
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:38.950
<v Speaker 1>You never tried to get laid when it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous.</v>

804
00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 1>You've never tried to pick up a girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

805
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:45.711
<v Speaker 1>There's no way medically you can get an </v>
<v Speaker 1>erection if you've never been 21 years </v>

806
00:37:46.121 --> 00:37:48.250
<v Speaker 1>old and thrown up in the backseat of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cab.</v>

807
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are you and who do you party with?</v>

808
00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.590
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

809
00:37:53.591 --> 00:37:58.591
<v Speaker 2>to go back to the people we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>to is it's a way to sort of distance </v>

810
00:37:58.961 --> 00:38:03.961
<v Speaker 2>yourself from all the norms and to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to question what the fuck's </v>

811
00:38:04.541 --> 00:38:09.541
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think and maybe some conspiracy </v>

812
00:38:09.541 --> 00:38:09.541
<v Speaker 2>theories are not true and maybe some </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't true,</v>

813
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:11.680
<v Speaker 2>but at least we have to question them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

814
00:38:11.681 --> 00:38:13.180
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot that aren't true,</v>

815
00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.690
<v Speaker 2>but for sure there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have to question them.</v>

816
00:38:15.691 --> 00:38:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the whole thing.</v>

817
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.630
<v Speaker 2>We have to question shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our.</v>

818
00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:23.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what we are as humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to fucking shit.</v>

819
00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.900
<v Speaker 2>And we also have to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we get better?</v>

820
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:32.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a funny thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not endorsing alcohol </v>

821
00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:36.361
<v Speaker 1>consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a certain humility that </v>

822
00:38:36.361 --> 00:38:36.361
<v Speaker 1>comes from being an drunk.</v>

823
00:38:36.361 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 3>Will you step back and kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

824
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.690
<v Speaker 3>you just realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

825
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:42.010
<v Speaker 3>this is all fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

826
00:38:42.011 --> 00:38:45.070
<v Speaker 3>like Tony Bourdain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know Anthony Bourdain,</v>

827
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I've had the pleasure of having on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast.</v>

828
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.350
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy,</v>

829
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.600
<v Speaker 3>just like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a regular dude,</v>

830
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:57.660
<v Speaker 3>you talk to them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a certain like having a </v>

831
00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.390
<v Speaker 3>drink with you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a drink with him,</v>

832
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.740
<v Speaker 3>having a drink with anyone who's just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real guy.</v>

833
00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:07.830
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who's where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's a moment that comes when </v>

834
00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:08.110
<v Speaker 3>you've had a couple of drinks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look at each other.</v>

835
00:39:08.111 --> 00:39:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

836
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.650
<v Speaker 2>we're fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

837
00:39:10.651 --> 00:39:13.620
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a perfect example of a dude.</v>

838
00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a cooking show on the travel </v>

839
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.770
<v Speaker 2>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well before that,</v>

840
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:19.890
<v Speaker 2>he's a chef.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a chef.</v>

841
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:21.660
<v Speaker 2>Wrote a book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the book,</v>

842
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:26.730
<v Speaker 2>it's told truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the hell happens in </v>

843
00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:27.420
<v Speaker 2>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

844
00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:32.450
<v Speaker 2>But he had it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a cooking show on the travel </v>

845
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.450
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing in nothing,</v>

846
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:37.190
<v Speaker 2>and he turned it into a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>statement and he turned it into trying </v>

847
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:38.790
<v Speaker 2>to tell the truth and he turned it into </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to eat some food,</v>

848
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:42.360
<v Speaker 2>but what the fuck is really going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with real people?</v>

849
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think again,</v>

850
00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:46.410
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole movement.</v>

851
00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:47.430
<v Speaker 2>There's you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's him,</v>

852
00:39:47.431 --> 00:39:48.090
<v Speaker 2>there's me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

853
00:39:48.091 --> 00:39:50.160
<v Speaker 2>but there's like $100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

854
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:55.580
<v Speaker 2>There's millions of this now because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology and I think that you know him</v>

855
00:39:57.601 --> 00:40:00.810
<v Speaker 2>and I believe he built the travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel on his.</v>

856
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.970
<v Speaker 2>What about Bert Kreischer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you feel about Bert?</v>

857
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Bert?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bert Dot com.</v>

858
00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:07.200
<v Speaker 2>Just to finish with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Anthony Bourdain.</v>

859
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:12.470
<v Speaker 2>I would say that that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy went out into the world and,</v>

860
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:18.200
<v Speaker 2>and talked about shit that you should </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about on a channel that would never</v>

861
00:40:19.471 --> 00:40:21.690
<v Speaker 2>talk about that shit otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a channel by the way.</v>

862
00:40:21.691 --> 00:40:24.630
<v Speaker 2>That's very conservative on by script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

863
00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:27.390
<v Speaker 2>Which is the server scripts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scripts.</v>

864
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So travel channels on prescriptions,</v>

865
00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:35.370
<v Speaker 2>pps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a very Christian fundamentalist and</v>

866
00:40:35.371 --> 00:40:40.371
<v Speaker 2>he takes a lot of heat and he gets a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shit and they tell them not to do </v>

867
00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:40.371
<v Speaker 2>stuff and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>

868
00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:45.261
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do it anyway because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to fucking tell the truth and I </v>

869
00:40:45.261 --> 00:40:46.260
<v Speaker 2>got to give it up to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a lot of fun</v>

870
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.560
<v Speaker 3>in their defense and their defense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do understand that the travel channel </v>

871
00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:55.441
<v Speaker 3>has started to try to reevaluate their </v>
<v Speaker 3>position and maybe reach out because I </v>

872
00:40:55.481 --> 00:41:00.481
<v Speaker 3>heard they're interested in Arusha fear </v>
<v Speaker 3>because some of their executive saw him </v>

873
00:41:00.481 --> 00:41:02.030
<v Speaker 3>kill at the dcm product and so they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

874
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.010
<v Speaker 2>But bordain ordain me like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

876
00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.190
<v Speaker 2>DRIPS is super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super conservative.</v>

877
00:41:07.191 --> 00:41:12.191
<v Speaker 2>Super Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their poster child is a dude who goes </v>

878
00:41:12.191 --> 00:41:13.220
<v Speaker 2>out in the world and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will eat some food.</v>

879

<v Speaker 2>We'll cook some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to tell you the fucking </v>

880
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:18.221
<v Speaker 2>truth about what's going on.</v>

881
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:18.221
<v Speaker 2>He.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

882

<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you some cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to show you some cool music.</v>

<v Speaker 2>are going to talk about what's really </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on</v>

885
00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.090
<v Speaker 3>and people are going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

886
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.570
<v Speaker 3>watch the travel channel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

887
00:41:30.830 --> 00:41:32.500
<v Speaker 3>I Bert Kreischer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love him to death.</v>

888
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 3>I would totally watch any show that</v>

889
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.040
<v Speaker 1>he's on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never watch the travel channel </v>

890
00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.040
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Bourdain was never.</v>

891
00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:43.000
<v Speaker 1>I never even thought about watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how I even tuned into his </v>

892
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.390
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspected I was just channel surfing.</v>

893
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just flipping through channels and</v>

894
00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:52.090
<v Speaker 1>all the sudden there's this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Vietnam and how much he </v>

895
00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:52.400
<v Speaker 1>loves Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember going,</v>

896
00:41:52.430 --> 00:41:57.430
<v Speaker 1>who is this crazy fuck my barrier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>camels and he's loving it.</v>

897
00:41:58.750 --> 00:42:00.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most importantly,</v>

898
00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:05.891
<v Speaker 1>he approaches the whole thing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this really palpable feeling of humility</v>

899
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:11.210
<v Speaker 1>and honesty and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pie drunkenness on occasion and it's,</v>

900
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

901
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:14.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not just admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enticing,</v>

902
00:42:14.811 --> 00:42:16.610
<v Speaker 1>it's attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It pulls me,</v>

903
00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like your shows all of your shows,</v>

904
00:42:19.071 --> 00:42:21.650
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out about vice because of the,</v>

905
00:42:21.651 --> 00:42:24.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Heinemann x a episode.</v>

906
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:29.500
<v Speaker 1>The guy who lives in the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where does he live in northeast Alaska </v>

907
00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:29.900
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

908
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.590
<v Speaker 1>He lives in the most remote part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

909
00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.090
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lives.</v>

910
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:37.880
<v Speaker 1>He's the most remote human being in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

911
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:38.930
<v Speaker 1>There's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

912
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I have a message board on my website and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the message board is before twitter,</v>

913
00:42:43.341 --> 00:42:45.940
<v Speaker 1>it's been around since like 1998.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

914
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.930
<v Speaker 1>my friend Andrew started the message </v>
<v Speaker 1>board and it's been this incredible like</v>

915
00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.980
<v Speaker 1>magnet for fucking Weirdos and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool people.</v>

916
00:42:55.220 --> 00:43:00.220
<v Speaker 1>But what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's been really fascinating that </v>

917
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 1>twitter is sort of surpassed it in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because of the sheer access.</v>

918
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:08.530
<v Speaker 1>But what my message board became was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just this strange area where cool shit </v>

919
00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:13.100
<v Speaker 1>would be drawn to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they would post these things,</v>

920
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.820
<v Speaker 1>these threads about shit you would never</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out on your own.</v>

921
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Just the average person is not connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>to community.</v>

922
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:21.470
<v Speaker 1>You're never gonna find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

923
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.990
<v Speaker 1>why would you even look at [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot com?</v>

924
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Why would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you be googling that would </v>

925
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.060
<v Speaker 1>connect you to a series?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone put up this,</v>

926
00:43:29.061 --> 00:43:34.061
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this link to this video and I watched </v>

927
00:43:34.061 --> 00:43:36.221
<v Speaker 1>this guy that's got frozen caribou </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging from a fucking tree and he saw </v>

928
00:43:36.221 --> 00:43:39.230
<v Speaker 1>them and cooking them and your guys that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were there,</v>

929
00:43:39.231 --> 00:43:44.231
<v Speaker 1>which is blown away by the experience of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with this dude lives in a </v>

930
00:43:44.231 --> 00:43:48.251
<v Speaker 1>100 foot square shack in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>most hostile environment,</v>

931
00:43:50.091 --> 00:43:55.091
<v Speaker 1>known demand and to see that he was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only was he not a loon but that he was,</v>

932
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.920
<v Speaker 1>there was no narration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narration was just sort of </v>

933
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:02.920
<v Speaker 1>describing how they got there and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on,</v>

934
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:07.720
<v Speaker 1>but it was never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was never any judgment on people or </v>

935
00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the scenario and w w what I found really</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about it,</v>

936
00:44:10.641 --> 00:44:13.310
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to know a guy with all the.</v>

937
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:18.410
<v Speaker 1>And Hind mole has lived here for 65 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

938
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:23.030
<v Speaker 1>He used content wondering the frozen </v>
<v Speaker 1>countryside,</v>

939
00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.560
<v Speaker 1>hoping to spot a Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is He happy?</v>

940
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Only high mode truly knows you didn't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

941
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:31.730
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

942
00:44:31.731 --> 00:44:36.731
<v Speaker 1>you instead inserted intelligent people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a alternative sort of a situation.</v>

943
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:38.670
<v Speaker 1>This sounds like a Bologna.</v>

944
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:44.050
<v Speaker 2>No Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking watch this one live is,</v>

945
00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:53.110
<v Speaker 2>it's because we practice it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A type of journalism called immersion </v>

946
00:44:53.110 --> 00:44:55.070
<v Speaker 2>isn't where we go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We immerse ourselves in the actual story</v>

947
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:58.220
<v Speaker 2>and we just pressed record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys changed this podcast?</v>

948
00:44:58.330 --> 00:44:58.450
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

949
00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I want you to know that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent that,</v>

950
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:06.501
<v Speaker 1>that episode and the subsequent episodes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I watched all the devil you guys </v>

951
00:45:06.501 --> 00:45:09.420
<v Speaker 1>changed because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is a fucking.</v>

952
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:11.190
<v Speaker 1>You're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're there,</v>

953
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:15.000
<v Speaker 1>you're actually there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know you're really going to write.</v>

954
00:45:15.001 --> 00:45:17.830
<v Speaker 1>When I was making fun of kissing </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's Dick,</v>

955
00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:24.580
<v Speaker 2>but I will say talking about twitter is </v>
<v Speaker 2>after I do this podcast,</v>

956
00:45:24.611 --> 00:45:29.611
<v Speaker 2>you get so much response from people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>give a shit and people who are saying </v>

957
00:45:32.380 --> 00:45:34.930
<v Speaker 2>this shit like the truth and it blew my </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind and this and that,</v>

958
00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:36.890
<v Speaker 2>and you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

959
00:45:36.891 --> 00:45:38.370
<v Speaker 2>we're guys just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

960
00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.500
<v Speaker 2>talking about shit and whatever and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going,</v>

961
00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:46.530
<v Speaker 2>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned more on that podcast and Fox </v>

962
00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:49.771
<v Speaker 2>and MSNBC and CNN and everybody all put </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and that's the tragedy.</v>

963
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:51.400
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great.</v>

964
00:45:51.401 --> 00:45:56.401
<v Speaker 2>For us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the tragedy because we're just </v>

965
00:45:56.401 --> 00:45:56.401
<v Speaker 2>regular dudes going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

966
00:45:56.401 --> 00:45:58.760
<v Speaker 2>this is what the fuck is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't think it's a tragedy,</v>

967
00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.100
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the the,</v>

968
00:46:00.101 --> 00:46:03.340
<v Speaker 1>the normal chain of progression and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's a natural.</v>

969
00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural system and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to be you unless you've </v>

970
00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:13.010
<v Speaker 1>seen burt reynolds get a crazy facelift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

971
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to be you until you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen all the most preposterous shit that</v>

972
00:46:19.691 --> 00:46:24.691
<v Speaker 1>people have done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to be you until you read </v>

973
00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:28.600
<v Speaker 1>all the crazy accounts of nonsensical </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence on the Internet,</v>

974
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:33.630
<v Speaker 1>either the crazy revolutions in Arab </v>
<v Speaker 1>spring and all over the world and all </v>

975
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.921
<v Speaker 1>the things you physically experienced by</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually being in these places where </v>

976
00:46:37.921 --> 00:46:41.761
<v Speaker 1>there are chaotic events that are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncontrollable by the population</v>

977
00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:47.930
<v Speaker 2>out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't mean anything unless </v>

978
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:50.660
<v Speaker 2>people watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean anything unless there's </v>

979
00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:50.660
<v Speaker 2>an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>

980
00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:50.890
<v Speaker 1>The you're compelled like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

981
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:56.030
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even take credit for what </v>

982
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.460
<v Speaker 1>you're doing because you're compelled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're compelled by the natural order of</v>

983
00:46:57.461 --> 00:47:02.461
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The natural order of the universe is to </v>

984
00:47:02.461 --> 00:47:05.251
<v Speaker 1>move in and in a progressive direction </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the more understanding and more </v>

985
00:47:05.251 --> 00:47:08.500
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive and lightened direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all of our ideas.</v>

986
00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:12.190
<v Speaker 1>The idea is not to maintain the science </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 17 hundreds.</v>

987
00:47:12.191 --> 00:47:14.620
<v Speaker 1>The idea is to figure out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

988
00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:19.830
<v Speaker 1>how to get on Mars and create an </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere so we can have a new plan in </v>

989
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:23.371
<v Speaker 1>case someone gets hit by an asteroid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ideas that are consistently move </v>

990
00:47:23.371 --> 00:47:27.181
<v Speaker 1>forward and I think we're just caught in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the struggle of that happening and my </v>

991
00:47:28.091 --> 00:47:30.040
<v Speaker 1>real hope for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the world.</v>

992
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

993
00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit about a gi.</v>

994
00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:37.840
<v Speaker 1>The people that believe that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifest reality.</v>

995
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:42.840
<v Speaker 1>They know the secret and the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your own mind and the more you </v>

996
00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:43.990
<v Speaker 1>focus on things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe maybe,</v>

997
00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:49.020
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just the fact that you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to what you could do </v>

998
00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 1>positively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what impacts the world.</v>

999
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:56.670
<v Speaker 1>And positively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we've got to figure out how to do </v>

1000
00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:00.090
<v Speaker 1>is to change the mindset of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and the people that are in </v>

1001
00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:04.261
<v Speaker 1>positions of power instead of fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and attacking them and try to </v>

1002
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:09.450
<v Speaker 1>understand the fact that the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>animal is incorrect,</v>

1003
00:48:09.460 --> 00:48:12.160
<v Speaker 1>doubly frustrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's going on.</v>

1004
00:48:12.161 --> 00:48:17.161
<v Speaker 1>We have these fucking bodies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same as pre internet pre </v>

1005
00:48:17.951 --> 00:48:22.951
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prix cars and planes and it's all </v>

1006
00:48:22.951 --> 00:48:26.551
<v Speaker 1>happened so quickly all around us that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't had the chance to really as </v>

1007
00:48:27.791 --> 00:48:29.590
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a super organism,</v>

1008
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:34.400
<v Speaker 1>taken all of the knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>distribute it in a way that w,</v>

1009
00:48:34.401 --> 00:48:39.401
<v Speaker 1>w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w where we we govern over the </v>

1010
00:48:39.401 --> 00:48:41.350
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of the population in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair and ethical way.</v>

1011
00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:46.351
<v Speaker 1>That keeps everybody happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think ultimately that that is a </v>

1012
00:48:46.351 --> 00:48:48.370
<v Speaker 1>possible scenario for sure.</v>

1013
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:50.060
<v Speaker 2>It has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has to be.</v>

1014
00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:52.020
<v Speaker 2>If we don't believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're really fucked.</v>

1015
00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:54.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was saying doom and gloom.</v>

1016
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is doom and gloom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is positive because as long</v>

1017
00:48:58.291 --> 00:49:03.291
<v Speaker 2>as we know what the fuck is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can work towards doing something </v>

1018
00:49:03.291 --> 00:49:06.471
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is is we didn't know what </v>

1019
00:49:06.471 --> 00:49:06.860
<v Speaker 2>the fuck was going on because nobody </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking told.</v>

1020
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.110
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfect way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a perfectly describing it.</v>

1021
00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:15.500
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is that we were living </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some crazy movie.</v>

1022
00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:21.860
<v Speaker 1>We since the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have been locked into some sort of </v>

1023
00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:26.150
<v Speaker 1>crazy version of the world that is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways based on fiction and the real </v>

1024
00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:31.680
<v Speaker 1>issue is whether the war of the worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when the war of the worlds.</v>

1025
00:49:31.681 --> 00:49:32.190
<v Speaker 1>You've got to Piss.</v>

1026
00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:33.830
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to go.</v>

1027
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1028
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:37.070
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing in your head?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go and get a drink of it.</v>

1029
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want you to say that.</v>

1030
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:42.490
<v Speaker 1>The war of the worlds freaked fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people out.</v>

1031
00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:45.700
<v Speaker 1>If you don't know what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orson Welles in like,</v>

1032
00:49:45.701 --> 00:49:48.190
<v Speaker 1>who knows when the fuck it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex wants to get out of here,</v>

1033
00:49:48.191 --> 00:49:49.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

1034
00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:54.600
<v Speaker 1>Take a seat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about your previous </v>

1035
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:54.600
<v Speaker 1>commitments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not as interesting.</v>

1036
00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.470
<v Speaker 1>The war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war of the worlds was the first time</v>

1037
00:49:56.471 --> 00:50:01.471
<v Speaker 1>where human beings were able to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricked into thinking by Orson Welles </v>

1038
00:50:04.451 --> 00:50:09.451
<v Speaker 1>that there was an attack by alien beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people freaked out and it's really </v>

1039
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:14.500
<v Speaker 1>difficult to discern how much of it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit,</v>

1040
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.810
<v Speaker 1>how I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it actually happened because</v>

1041
00:50:16.811 --> 00:50:19.750
<v Speaker 1>they say there were suicides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what the actual statistics,</v>

1042
00:50:19.751 --> 00:50:24.751
<v Speaker 1>where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the 19 thirties or </v>

1043
00:50:24.751 --> 00:50:27.571
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality which is that human </v>

1044
00:50:27.571 --> 00:50:28.010
<v Speaker 1>beings were not prepared for</v>

1045
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.490
<v Speaker 3>the information that was coming at them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were in prepared.</v>

1046
00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:36.230
<v Speaker 3>That wasn't an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't a regular part of their life</v>

1047
00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:41.380
<v Speaker 3>where they had grown accustomed to </v>
<v Speaker 3>having this fakery planted on them.</v>

1048
00:50:41.661 --> 00:50:44.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not like today with the onion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1049
00:50:44.051 --> 00:50:47.210
<v Speaker 3>like every now and then I'll retweet an </v>
<v Speaker 3>article and it turns out to be like some</v>

1050
00:50:47.211 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 3>new fake onion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some,</v>

1051
00:50:49.420 --> 00:50:52.910
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of dudes who like think that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>onion is cool.</v>

1052
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:55.370
<v Speaker 3>So they create their own bullshit news </v>
<v Speaker 3>story.</v>

1053
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 3>Those motherfuckers and your retweet </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1054
00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.760
<v Speaker 3>But that's to be expected that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1055
00:51:00.761 --> 00:51:05.761
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people that existed before the </v>

1056
00:51:05.761 --> 00:51:09.311
<v Speaker 3>internet or before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are the people that sort of set </v>

1057
00:51:09.311 --> 00:51:11.060
<v Speaker 3>this scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They set the momentum of our culture and</v>

1058
00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:14.960
<v Speaker 3>they did not have access this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have now.</v>

1059
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:20.110
<v Speaker 3>The idea that we're so hung up on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>brilliant wisdom of some people that </v>

1060
00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:23.390
<v Speaker 3>lived in the 17 hundreds and created the</v>
<v Speaker 3>declaration of independence,</v>

1061
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:25.280
<v Speaker 3>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was written on fucking hemp.</v>

1062
00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.530
<v Speaker 3>The first drafts that the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're committed to the ideology,</v>

1063
00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:31.170
<v Speaker 3>these people that lived,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have</v>

1064
00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:35.290
<v Speaker 2>car cars or 2000 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when religion started.</v>

1065
00:51:35.291 --> 00:51:37.360
<v Speaker 2>And ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else is a cult.</v>

1066
00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:42.690
<v Speaker 2>But 2000 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when we knew what the fuck was </v>

1067
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:42.690
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1068
00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I've got to juggle my act about Romney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a cult when you know who wrote</v>

1069
00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:47.080
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we can.</v>

1070
00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not like we have to go back to some</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shit they found in Qumran that </v>

1071
00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:52.990
<v Speaker 2>was written on animal skins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1072
00:51:52.991 --> 00:51:54.960
<v Speaker 2>this is like we know the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1073
00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:57.610
<v Speaker 2>his name is Joseph Smith and he was only</v>
<v Speaker 2>14.</v>

1074
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is not that confusing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking cult man,</v>

1075
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:06.430
<v Speaker 2>but he found the book of Latter Day </v>
<v Speaker 2>saints in his backyard.</v>

1076
00:52:06.460 --> 00:52:11.460
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's beautiful about the Mormon </v>

1077
00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:14.041
<v Speaker 2>culture is that what I've learned from </v>
<v Speaker 2>my personal experiences is that there </v>

1078
00:52:14.041 --> 00:52:16.700
<v Speaker 2>are certain people in this life and </v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't</v>

1079
00:52:16.770 --> 00:52:21.770
<v Speaker 3>feel it's justified to lie to people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's certain people who do get by </v>

1080
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:26.380
<v Speaker 3>better if they follow like at least a </v>
<v Speaker 3>scaffolding of morality.</v>

1081
00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:31.650
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some sort of something that lets them </v>

1082
00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.511
<v Speaker 3>believe that at the very top there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Cherry and that cherries God and he's </v>

1083
00:52:34.511 --> 00:52:35.050
<v Speaker 3>right up there on top of the whipped </v>
<v Speaker 3>cream and you just got to get.</v>

1084
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the problem is that if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at this,</v>

1085
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.260
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about global warming </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier and you say,</v>

1086
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:44.150
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1087
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Shit's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world is thinking we're not going to</v>

1088
00:52:47.841 --> 00:52:50.570
<v Speaker 2>believe in that because of God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

1089
00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:55.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to die and your kids </v>

1090
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:55.600
<v Speaker 2>are going to die and it's going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad if we don't just say,</v>

1091
00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:59.040
<v Speaker 2>this is the thing that is bad that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in a sense.</v>

1092
00:52:59.230 --> 00:53:04.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's gotten whatever and they </v>

1093
00:53:04.230 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's this yearning to have.</v>

1094
00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:08.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a rational being who has a plan </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all of us.</v>

1095
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact of the matter is is we are </v>

1096
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.290
<v Speaker 2>creating our reality and we are not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rational entity.</v>

1097
00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Humanity isn't rational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humanity is irrational and complex and </v>

1098
00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:25.301
<v Speaker 2>fucked up and weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at some point somebody has got to </v>

1099
00:53:25.301 --> 00:53:25.301
<v Speaker 2>come up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1100
00:53:25.301 --> 00:53:26.680
<v Speaker 2>rational and where we given.</v>

1101
00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:31.900
<v Speaker 2>But there are certain things that we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>which are self destructive.</v>

1102
00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:34.630
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to stop.</v>

1103
00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:39.780
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have the ability to destroy the </v>

1104
00:53:40.151 --> 00:53:41.710
<v Speaker 2>fucking world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is my world,</v>

1105
00:53:41.711 --> 00:53:43.660
<v Speaker 2>you're destroying my world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1106
00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.240
<v Speaker 2>And you're halfway across the world over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1107
00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:51.070
<v Speaker 2>If that's even a possibility that no is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer,</v>

1108
00:53:51.250 --> 00:53:52.720
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to let that happen.</v>

1109
00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.670
<v Speaker 2>So that's why I keep preaching on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1110
00:53:54.671 --> 00:53:59.671
<v Speaker 2>Because when I went there and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton said it's the end of the </v>

1111
00:53:59.671 --> 00:53:59.671
<v Speaker 2>world by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went,</v>

1112
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:03.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when he left the presidency,</v>

1113
00:54:03.341 --> 00:54:08.341
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the reason why cargo was more </v>

1114
00:54:08.341 --> 00:54:09.670
<v Speaker 2>between India and Pakistan was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>glimpse of the end of the world.</v>

1115
00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.960
<v Speaker 2>And then he got his dick sucked by young</v>
<v Speaker 2>and old.</v>

1116
00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:15.820
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

1117
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:18.900
<v Speaker 3>that's why it takes blows house of </v>
<v Speaker 3>interns.</v>

1118
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:22.830
<v Speaker 3>So why not at least enjoy that sweet </v>
<v Speaker 3>release,</v>

1119
00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:23.370
<v Speaker 3>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drink,</v>

1120
00:54:23.371 --> 00:54:25.700
<v Speaker 3>and be merry phase,</v>

1121
00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:27.950
<v Speaker 2>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drink,</v>

1122
00:54:27.951 --> 00:54:30.410
<v Speaker 2>and be merry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with that is,</v>

1123
00:54:30.411 --> 00:54:31.940
<v Speaker 2>is when we went back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we realized,</v>

1124
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:34.580
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking way worse than when he said</v>

1125
00:54:34.581 --> 00:54:36.830
<v Speaker 2>it was the end of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hold on,</v>

1126
00:54:36.831 --> 00:54:38.030
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is,</v>

1127
00:54:38.031 --> 00:54:40.130
<v Speaker 2>is though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is we can stop it.</v>

1128
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:43.580
<v Speaker 2>We can say fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>

1129
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.810
<v Speaker 2>We can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just have to say there is,</v>

1130
00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.580
<v Speaker 2>there can be no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1131
00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intercontinental ballistic or nuclear </v>

1132
00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:54.590
<v Speaker 2>warheads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There can be no,</v>

1133
00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:59.320
<v Speaker 2>because what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so everybody understands what </v>

1134
00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.890
<v Speaker 2>you're saying then is as long as that </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology is there,</v>

1135
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:04.700
<v Speaker 2>it will go to Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will go to Pakistan,</v>

1136
00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:08.090
<v Speaker 2>it will go to Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will go to Libya,</v>

1137
00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:11.930
<v Speaker 2>it will go because the technology is </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1138
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:17.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens when Kadafi now could </v>

1139
00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:19.901
<v Speaker 2>fee is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what happens when Kadafi has </v>

1140
00:55:19.901 --> 00:55:22.390
<v Speaker 2>warheads?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when a que con has </v>

1141
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.390
<v Speaker 2>warheads?</v>

1142
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.640
<v Speaker 2>What happens when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Iran has words,</v>

1143
00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:27.880
<v Speaker 2>when Israel attacks Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it can have a nuclear around </v>

1144
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:33.910
<v Speaker 2>what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will happen when they attacked </v>

1145
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:34.130
<v Speaker 2>around?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows.</v>

1146
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:39.190
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows what will happen when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they attack rent and it's going to be a </v>

1147
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:40.190
<v Speaker 2>fucking catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

1148
00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:44.230
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing zero compared to what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in India,</v>

1149
00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel and Palestine is like,</v>

1150
00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.840
<v Speaker 2>you know like I guess when you're like </v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

1151
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:55.880
<v Speaker 2>21 and you have that one couple that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just won't fucking break up and they </v>

1152
00:55:56.421 --> 00:55:58.970
<v Speaker 2>keep fighting and they keep asking you </v>
<v Speaker 2>for advice.</v>

1153
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.630
<v Speaker 2>What do you think I should tell her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro?</v>

1154
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:02.310
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's tiller and I'm like,</v>

1155
00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:05.000
<v Speaker 2>I think you should fucking run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's people now.</v>

1156
00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.390
<v Speaker 3>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of them that use that as a</v>

1157
00:56:10.391 --> 00:56:11.280
<v Speaker 3>distraction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1158
00:56:11.340 --> 00:56:16.340
<v Speaker 3>Don't they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They aren't all conflicts ultimately </v>

1159
00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:20.521
<v Speaker 3>some form of distraction because if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the Israelis looked at the </v>

1160
00:56:21.071 --> 00:56:26.071
<v Speaker 3>Palestinians that are suffering and </v>
<v Speaker 3>these poor people that are trying to </v>

1161
00:56:26.071 --> 00:56:26.071
<v Speaker 3>make</v>

1162
00:56:26.071 --> 00:56:26.071
<v Speaker 2>this sort of</v>

1163
00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 3>home for themselves in this Gaza region </v>
<v Speaker 3>is very dangerous and hostile region.</v>

1164
00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.880
<v Speaker 3>What if they treated them all as </v>
<v Speaker 3>Israelis?</v>

1165
00:56:34.881 --> 00:56:39.881
<v Speaker 3>What if they treated them all as just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fellow humans would if instead of </v>

1166
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:42.770
<v Speaker 3>lumping them into groups based on </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideology and who believes what old crazy</v>

1167
00:56:42.771 --> 00:56:47.771
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if they just looked at him as </v>

1168
00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:49.920
<v Speaker 3>things that could be cousins that I mean</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would instantly changed the whole </v>

1169
00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:53.681
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that we need to exist in a </v>

1170
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:55.040
<v Speaker 3>conflict scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the problem?</v>

1171
00:56:55.041 --> 00:56:57.680
<v Speaker 3>That's the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't agree with that.</v>

1172
00:56:57.681 --> 00:57:02.681
<v Speaker 3>I have a neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know this motherfucker and </v>

1173
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:02.681
<v Speaker 3>he wanted me to chop down my trees,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's still nice.</v>

1174
00:57:02.681 --> 00:57:05.160
<v Speaker 3>I say hi to him when I drive by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a convert.</v>

1175
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.970
<v Speaker 3>The only conversation I've ever had with</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy was a conflict,</v>

1176
00:57:07.971 --> 00:57:08.990
<v Speaker 3>but I don't hate the dude.</v>

1177
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:10.460
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want them to be happy.</v>

1178
00:57:10.461 --> 00:57:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Just don't be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me alone your mother fucker.</v>

1179
00:57:12.441 --> 00:57:13.340
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you a hug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come here,</v>

1180
00:57:13.341 --> 00:57:15.290

<v Speaker 3>let's go have a drink.</v>

1182
00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what we should treat.</v>

1183
00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:22.900
<v Speaker 3>The whole world can approach other human</v>
<v Speaker 3>beings like that.</v>

1184
00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 3>It's just we have to get past this </v>
<v Speaker 3>ingrained scenario that we have in our </v>

1185
00:57:28.731 --> 00:57:33.731
<v Speaker 3>head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is that war is a part of nature </v>

1186
00:57:33.731 --> 00:57:34.010
<v Speaker 3>and nature is unsurmountable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1187
00:57:34.011 --> 00:57:35.900
<v Speaker 3>it is what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to accept,</v>

1188
00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:41.290
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna want to be philanders and </v>

1189
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:42.680
<v Speaker 3>you know there's going to be conquest </v>
<v Speaker 3>and swords and fucking rocket.</v>

1190
00:57:42.681 --> 00:57:42.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1191
00:57:42.810 --> 00:57:47.810
<v Speaker 2>but if you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to Mexico and you see what's </v>

1192
00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:47.810
<v Speaker 2>happening there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's the rule of the thug.</v>

1193
00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:49.380
<v Speaker 2>If you go to Pakistan as the rule of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>

1194
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:51.000
<v Speaker 2>if you go to Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the fuck.</v>

1195
00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because conflict breeds lowest common </v>

1196
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:59.871
<v Speaker 2>denominator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It breeds I have a gun and I'm willing </v>

1197
00:57:59.871 --> 00:57:59.871
<v Speaker 2>to shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1198
00:57:59.910 --> 00:58:02.490
<v Speaker 2>And whoever that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those aren't high thinking people.</v>

1199
00:58:02.491 --> 00:58:04.830
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't people thinking we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to save the world.</v>

1200
00:58:04.831 --> 00:58:06.510
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't people thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1201
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:10.110
<v Speaker 2>the world is thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't people thinking we could,</v>

1202
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:12.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy the environment by,</v>

1203
00:58:13.230 --> 00:58:16.320
<v Speaker 2>by having a new kid or standup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they're thinking is,</v>

1204
00:58:16.321 --> 00:58:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to gain power because I have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of guys,</v>

1205
00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:22.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young guys,</v>

1206
00:58:22.531 --> 00:58:27.531
<v Speaker 2>you generally young men with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at what's happening in </v>

1207
00:58:27.531 --> 00:58:30.531
<v Speaker 2>Europe right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what's terrifying is you go to </v>

1208
00:58:30.531 --> 00:58:30.531
<v Speaker 2>Spain and you say Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1209
00:58:30.531 --> 00:58:32.790
<v Speaker 2>old country educated country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1210
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.780
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

1211
00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Fifty percent of young people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>unemployed,</v>

1212
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:41.010
<v Speaker 2>so you've taken away their future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just shooting.</v>

1213
00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:44.400
<v Speaker 2>Their 6 million people came out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking shut the whole country.</v>

1214
00:58:44.401 --> 00:58:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Then that's people who are pissed off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really pissed off.</v>

1215
00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.410
<v Speaker 2>While you were filming there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

1216
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Riots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1217
00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:52.390
<v Speaker 2>what would they have?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1218
00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:54.510
<v Speaker 2>there about us anti-austerity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

1219
00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:59.560
<v Speaker 2>it's young people saying we're fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean there's riots in Paris and </v>

1220
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.270
<v Speaker 2>how sturdy means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

1221
00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:01.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1222
00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Spain is fucked economically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economically.</v>

1223
00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:07.320
<v Speaker 2>What's happening there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's really terrifying is that</v>

1224
00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:08.760
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1225
00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.760
<v Speaker 2>in so prolonged economic crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the recession.</v>

1226
00:59:12.090 --> 00:59:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time this happened was the </v>

1227
00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:17.090
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what happened?</v>

1228
00:59:17.090 --> 00:59:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Because of the depression was the rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>of radical political solutions.</v>

1229
00:59:19.321 --> 00:59:24.321
<v Speaker 2>I eat communism or fascism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now what's happened is you have the </v>

1230
00:59:24.651 --> 00:59:26.570
<v Speaker 2>rise of the Communist Party in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1231
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:27.680
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Greece,</v>

1232
00:59:27.681 --> 00:59:29.540
<v Speaker 2>and to counteract that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the golden dawn,</v>

1233
00:59:29.541 --> 00:59:32.830
<v Speaker 2>which are full on fascists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who now are,</v>

1234
00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:33.640
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

1235
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 percent of the government.</v>

1236
00:59:35.331 --> 00:59:37.660
<v Speaker 2>Did you say the Golden Dawn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Golden Dawn are?</v>

1237
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard.</v>

1238
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.940
<v Speaker 2>The Golden Dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>

1239
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:43.370
<v Speaker 2>They do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say the golden dawn will pretend because</v>

1240
00:59:43.371 --> 00:59:44.330
<v Speaker 2>it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>

1241
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:45.330
<v Speaker 2>Golden Dawn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1242
00:59:45.331 --> 00:59:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do the.</v>

1243
00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.430
<v Speaker 2>They do the Nazi salute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had the swastika</v>

1244
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.140
<v Speaker 3>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine if they had a big fucking thing.</v>

1245
00:59:51.141 --> 00:59:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Other shirt was a big golden day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Frothy dogs.</v>

1246
00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Would it be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would it be hard or would that be </v>

1247
00:59:59.380 --> 00:59:59.380
<v Speaker 3>offensive for a military would have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like,</v>

1248
00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:04.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the support of the military </v>

1249
01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:05.890
<v Speaker 2>and the police and everywhere we went </v>
<v Speaker 2>was anti immigration,</v>

1250
01:00:05.891 --> 01:00:07.240
<v Speaker 2>anti EU,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti this.</v>

1251
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.100
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's happening in Europe.</v>

1252
01:00:09.101 --> 01:00:12.550
<v Speaker 2>This is what's terrifying is because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an economic crisis,</v>

1253
01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:14.740
<v Speaker 2>you have the rise of communist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascist.</v>

1254
01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:19.770
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in France you have a very far left </v>

1255
01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:23.101
<v Speaker 2>government and the second party is from </v>
<v Speaker 2>national fascist and you sit there and </v>

1256
01:00:23.101 --> 01:00:23.590
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1257
01:00:23.591 --> 01:00:26.680
<v Speaker 2>the exact same political situation </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1258
01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.390
<v Speaker 2>That started World War Two is happening </v>
<v Speaker 2>today in Europe,</v>

1259
01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.820
<v Speaker 2>not fucking Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not Pakistan,</v>

1260
01:00:33.821 --> 01:00:35.260
<v Speaker 2>not India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>

1261
01:00:35.770 --> 01:00:38.350
<v Speaker 2>and it's happening in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's happening in Scandinavia,</v>

1262
01:00:38.351 --> 01:00:40.030
<v Speaker 2>it's happening in Spain and happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italy.</v>

1263
01:00:40.031 --> 01:00:45.031
<v Speaker 2>It's happening in Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening in all these countries </v>

1264
01:00:45.031 --> 01:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>and you sit there and everyone just </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching as exactly the same fucking </v>

1265
01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:49.780
<v Speaker 2>thing that started World War II to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>t,</v>

1266
01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.420
<v Speaker 2>to the fucking teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>riots in the streets,</v>

1267
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.720
<v Speaker 2>ultra right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultra left wing parties fighting each </v>

1268
01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.781
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical parties getting more and more </v>

1269
01:01:00.781 --> 01:01:00.781
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're just saying,</v>

1270
01:01:00.781 --> 01:01:04.210
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck do we have to do to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to relive it again.</v>

1271
01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.910
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly the same thing that started</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1272
01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.720
<v Speaker 3>a natural cycle of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1273
01:01:10.721 --> 01:01:13.640
<v Speaker 3>if you look at societies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can look at cultures and you look at</v>

1274
01:01:13.641 --> 01:01:17.460
<v Speaker 3>this rise and fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you go to the Acropolis and you see</v>

1275
01:01:17.461 --> 01:01:20.740
<v Speaker 3>the ancient Greek ruins and you wonder </v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck why?</v>

1276
01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:24.710
<v Speaker 3>Why are these regular houses like really</v>
<v Speaker 3>close to this incredible structure?</v>

1277
01:01:24.711 --> 01:01:27.110
<v Speaker 3>What happened is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this inevitable?</v>

1278
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:32.230
<v Speaker 3>Do are we in this constant state of </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing consciousness and one of the </v>

1279
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:38.620
<v Speaker 3>big wrestling matches of trying to sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of innovate and accomplish higher levels</v>

1280
01:01:39.351 --> 01:01:39.720
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1281
01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.880
<v Speaker 3>of society and culture is that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to meet some sort of opposition</v>

1282
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:50.860
<v Speaker 3>and if you don't meet opposition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you won't have the motivation to really </v>

1283
01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.971
<v Speaker 3>accelerate things as fast as the </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology around you is accelerating </v>

1284
01:01:54.971 --> 01:01:57.650
<v Speaker 3>and completely get out of hand like it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is right now.</v>

1285
01:01:57.920 --> 01:02:02.920
<v Speaker 3>It is right now with with dictators and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy fucks controlling nuclear weapons </v>

1286
01:02:03.411 --> 01:02:06.500
<v Speaker 3>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like those things have to be</v>

1287
01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:09.650
<v Speaker 3>in place in order to motivate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest levels of thinking.</v>

1288
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.200
<v Speaker 2>You know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1289
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:13.850
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cliche is those who don't understand</v>

1290
01:02:13.851 --> 01:02:18.851
<v Speaker 2>history are doomed to repeat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's interesting is when you go talk </v>

1291
01:02:18.851 --> 01:02:21.490
<v Speaker 2>to young people in Europe and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that this is exactly the same</v>

1292
01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:24.890
<v Speaker 2>thing that happened at the start of </v>
<v Speaker 2>world war two.</v>

1293
01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:26.950
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't you know,</v>

1294
01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.490
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and they don't understand history.</v>

1295
01:02:30.491 --> 01:02:34.000
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is they don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>war and if you ever go look at war,</v>

1296
01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:37.840
<v Speaker 2>and this is where I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rack is war isn't the manly,</v>

1297
01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:41.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my shoulder nicked by a,</v>

1298
01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:46.260
<v Speaker 2>by a bullet or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come back with a purple heart or is a </v>

1299
01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.590
<v Speaker 2>catheter bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>War is I don't walk again,</v>

1300
01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:52.591
<v Speaker 2>war is I'm irradiated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>War is I'm fucked up in the brain for </v>

1301
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:52.591
<v Speaker 2>the rest of my life.</v>

1302
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:55.150
<v Speaker 2>And those who don't understand war are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doomed to repeat it.</v>

1303
01:02:55.151 --> 01:02:56.650
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1304
01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:58.930
<v Speaker 2>hawks and people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to war,</v>

1305
01:02:58.931 --> 01:03:00.760
<v Speaker 2>let's go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to war,</v>

1306
01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>go see a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking tragic.</v>

1307
01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.960
<v Speaker 2>It's tragic from start to fucking finish</v>
<v Speaker 2>its babies with no fucking fathers.</v>

1308
01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:13.870
<v Speaker 2>It's every man fucking killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rape.</v>

1309
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:14.860
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1310
01:03:14.861 --> 01:03:17.690
<v Speaker 2>in some cases in Africa cannibalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1311
01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:22.740
<v Speaker 2>it's literally the lowest form of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we are as humanity and people who say,</v>

1312
01:03:22.781 --> 01:03:24.250
<v Speaker 2>let's go to fucking war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to war.</v>

1313
01:03:24.251 --> 01:03:29.251
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should fucking realize that before </v>

1314
01:03:29.251 --> 01:03:29.251
<v Speaker 2>you go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young dudes,</v>

1315
01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:34.310
<v Speaker 2>you know that we know are going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>back and their dick isn't going to work </v>

1316
01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:34.310
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking shit.</v>

1317
01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:34.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1319
01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:40.810
<v Speaker 2>that's what these people are proposing </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Europe,</v>

1320
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.000
<v Speaker 2>in India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Pakistan,</v>

1321
01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:45.070
<v Speaker 2>in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Southeast Asia,</v>

1322
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>in some cases in South America and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some cases here,</v>

1323
01:03:48.550 --> 01:03:49.840
<v Speaker 2>that's what people are proposing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1324
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just like to take anyone who </v>

1325
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 2>wants to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go to war.</v>

1326
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:59.371
<v Speaker 2>I'd like to take them to a war zone </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you take people to a war </v>

1327
01:03:59.371 --> 01:03:59.371
<v Speaker 2>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first you puke,</v>

1328
01:03:59.371 --> 01:04:00.600
<v Speaker 2>then you cry and then you freaked the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck up.</v>

1329
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:06.240
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think in positions of power </v>

1330
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:06.240
<v Speaker 1>actually go to war zones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

1331
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the what are some must.</v>

1332
01:04:09.381 --> 01:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

1333
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:13.040
<v Speaker 2>you see photos you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't see what it really does.</v>

1334
01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>So you don't see the reason why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why I do what I do is because</v>

1335
01:04:20.961 --> 01:04:25.961
<v Speaker 2>I've been to war zones and I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that makes your stomach turn and </v>

1336
01:04:25.961 --> 01:04:30.941
<v Speaker 2>you'll never sleep right again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you see what war really </v>

1337
01:04:30.941 --> 01:04:32.960
<v Speaker 2>fucking doesn't talk to marines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked to rangers and talked to guys who</v>

1338
01:04:32.961 --> 01:04:37.961
<v Speaker 2>come back from war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to them before they go and then </v>

1339
01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:41.381
<v Speaker 2>talk to them when they come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a completely different fucking </v>

1340
01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:41.381
<v Speaker 2>conversation I have</v>

1341
01:04:41.381 --> 01:04:43.000
<v Speaker 1>and it's very similar to people that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know that had been to jail.</v>

1342
01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:46.180
<v Speaker 1>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend.</v>

1343
01:04:46.690 --> 01:04:51.690
<v Speaker 1>We were friends when I was a teenager </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was always crazy and he just </v>

1344
01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:56.821
<v Speaker 1>vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know what happened because I </v>

1345
01:04:56.821 --> 01:04:56.821
<v Speaker 1>just knew him from the martial arts gym </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I trained at,</v>

1346
01:04:56.830 --> 01:05:01.270
<v Speaker 1>but he came back three years later with </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these crazy scars all over his body.</v>

1347
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>He had been a prison and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different human being.</v>

1348
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>It was like before he was as lovable </v>
<v Speaker 1>troublemaker and three years later the </v>

1349
01:05:10.661 --> 01:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>lovable troublemaker was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a psycho.</v>

1350
01:05:13.631 --> 01:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy who had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would fight for survival.</v>

1351
01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>He was a wild animal.</v>

1352
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 2>You won't come back normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't come back.</v>

1353
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1354
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I've met friends that have gone to war </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

1355
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

1356
01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>I've had quite a few friends that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the military and went over and came </v>

1357
01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:30.750
<v Speaker 1>back including a buddy of mine who went </v>
<v Speaker 1>over as a mercenary.</v>

1358
01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1359
01:05:31.801 --> 01:05:36.801
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird conversation when you're </v>

1360
01:05:36.801 --> 01:05:36.801
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1361
01:05:36.801 --> 01:05:37.080
<v Speaker 1>sitting down on the curb somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go on.</v>

1362
01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.370
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So would you have to do.</v>

1363
01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:41.030
<v Speaker 1>What was it like what would you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1364
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:43.300
<v Speaker 1>how much they pay you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to do it again?</v>

1365
01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.460
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done.</v>

1366
01:05:44.550 --> 01:05:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>

1367
01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:51.770
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's realities in this world that I </v>

1368
01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:54.561
<v Speaker 1>think most people in their day to day </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence do not consider as a part of </v>

1369
01:05:54.841 --> 01:05:58.590
<v Speaker 1>the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those realities are real problem.</v>

1370
01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:02.790
<v Speaker 1>The real problem for our culture because</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only are they disgusting but they're</v>

1371
01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>unknown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're avoidable there.</v>

1372
01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Most of them are avoidable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a distorted perception of what </v>

1373
01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:10.560
<v Speaker 1>can be done with the resources that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have in place.</v>

1374
01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.420
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the sort of perception </v>

<v Speaker 2>if you go over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you go over from our </v>
