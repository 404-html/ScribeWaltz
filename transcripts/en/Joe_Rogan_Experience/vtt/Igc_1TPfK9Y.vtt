1
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're alive.</v>

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:07.440
<v Speaker 1>How are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

4
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks for being here,</v>

5
00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:09.510
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really appreciate it.</v>

6
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>It is the coolest thing I've done really</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that far back.</v>

8
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>I watched your ted talk on what was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>word that you used?</v>

10
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:24.741
<v Speaker 1>A Leicester Land and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it felt hopeless,</v>

11
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.270
<v Speaker 1>like if people don't know what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about because you just give like</v>

12
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.113
<v Speaker 1>a brief synopsis of the way you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing how completely completely </v>

13
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:35.994
<v Speaker 1>rigged our election system is and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually takes to be elected and how </v>

14
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:47.481
<v Speaker 1>much of the time they spend is involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in raising money and why.</v>

15
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a system where we have a </v>

16
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:52.554
<v Speaker 1>money primary and then we have a regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>election and in the money primary to </v>

17
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>compete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta raise tons of money to be able</v>

18
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>to fund your campaign.</v>

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.430
<v Speaker 1>And when you raise that money you raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>it from a tiny,</v>

20
00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.264
<v Speaker 1>tiny fraction of the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So unless in the Ted talk about lesser </v>

21
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:10.344
<v Speaker 1>known and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>imagine a place called Lester land where</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically it's the lesters who rule.</v>

23
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.823
<v Speaker 1>And by the lesters I mean the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportion of people named Lester as in </v>

24
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>the United States right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's about 150,000</v>

25
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Americans named Lester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of them.</v>

26
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 1>But here we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Leicester.</v>

27
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a world ruled by Lester land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.353
<v Speaker 1>because that's essentially the world we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have because of the way we fund our </v>

29
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:38.544
<v Speaker 1>campaigns because there's about 150,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>men who give even just the maximum </v>

30
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:44.874
<v Speaker 1>contribution to one political candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you ask who the number of people </v>

31
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>who give the maximum contribution over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the course of a campaign,</v>

32
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>meaning in the primary and the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>election,</v>

33
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:54.834
<v Speaker 1>it's about 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans in 2014 who gave them maximum </v>

34
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:01.340
<v Speaker 1>contribution to one political campaigns.</v>

35
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.340
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is it's a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny fraction who are the most important</v>

36
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>funders of political campaigns and </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates for Congress.</v>

37
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Members of Congress spend 30 to 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of their time sucking up to this</v>

38
00:02:16.651 --> 00:02:18.690
<v Speaker 1>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny fraction.</v>

39
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.943
<v Speaker 1>And so is it any surprise that you see </v>
<v Speaker 1>congress bending over backwards to keep </v>

40
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>those guys happy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they know without those people,</v>

41
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a shot at getting back </v>
<v Speaker 1>into congress.</v>

42
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>And the way you were describing it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were saying it as lester land,</v>

43
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if we were this screwed up.</v>

44
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>That was essentially what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.550
<v Speaker 1>But we're more screwed up lester land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.463
<v Speaker 1>we're more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a disturbing video because I </v>

47
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>was realized there was emerging as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>were speaking.</v>

48
00:02:49.021 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

49
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>is it that bad?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

51
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since that video have come to think it's</v>

52
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>even worse.</v>

53
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>So like clearance land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>it could be worse because it's even </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller number.</v>

55
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the number of Super </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pac donors,</v>

56
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really critical super packed hundred</v>

57
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.883
<v Speaker 1>about a hundred people who gave more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than half of the Super Pac money in the </v>

58
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.250
<v Speaker 1>last presidential election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,</v>

59
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is a really tiny,</v>

60
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>tiny number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.023
<v Speaker 1>but what this tiny number represents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we fund campaigns is the </v>

62
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary inequality on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>

63
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But since,</v>

64
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.353
<v Speaker 1>since I was focused on the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've more recently started thinking </v>

65
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>about the other screwed up dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about gerrymandering.</v>

66
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gerrymander districts in America,</v>

67
00:03:40.361 --> 00:03:41.194
<v Speaker 1>so that about 85 percent of the house </v>
<v Speaker 1>seats in the United States Congress are </v>

68
00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:46.894
<v Speaker 1>safe seats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means if you're a republican in a </v>

69
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>safe seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic district,</v>

70
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>your views just never mattered to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congressperson,</v>

71
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.593
<v Speaker 1>cause that vote of a Republican will </v>
<v Speaker 1>never determine who's in Congress or a </v>

72
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Democrat and Republican district.</v>

73
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>That's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

74
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean those congress </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not afraid about reelection.</v>

75
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.313
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are afraid about whether there'll </v>

76
00:04:09.041 --> 00:04:09.874
<v Speaker 1>be reluctant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're afraid not of a Democrat </v>

77
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:12.604
<v Speaker 1>running against a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they afraid of an even more extreme </v>

78
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>republican running against the incumbent</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican.</v>

79
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:18.634
<v Speaker 1>So what those incumbents in those safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>seat districts do is they obsess about </v>

80
00:04:24.761 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>what the extremists in their own party </v>
<v Speaker 1>cares about.</v>

81
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.133
<v Speaker 1>So the extremists on the left and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right have this ability to leverage </v>

82
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.594
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary influence inside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>House of Representatives simply because </v>

83
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>we've decided to gerrymander these </v>
<v Speaker 1>districts to create these safe seats.</v>

84
00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>So those extremists are a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lester's too.</v>

85
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.940
<v Speaker 1>There are more of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more democratic than lester land,</v>

86
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.253
<v Speaker 1>but they too have enormous influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>over ordinary people in most ordinary </v>

87
00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>people's views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then to these congress people just don't</v>

88
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:56.614
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That feels hopeless for a dummy like me </v>

89
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.740
<v Speaker 1>sit on the outside looking at this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

90
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:07.741
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is this deeply entrenched with.</v>

91
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess it's not technically </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption because it's all legal,</v>

92
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's an entanglement with money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>with influence that.</v>

93
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you unwind this?</v>

94
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that point is really critical.</v>

95
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 1>It's not technically illegal and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means is that people are engaged in</v>

96
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:34.390
<v Speaker 1>this or not doing wrong things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just playing by the rules,</v>

97
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.433
<v Speaker 1>their plan with the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that the system has become </v>

98
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 1>corrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When did it start?</v>

99
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.363
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the moment the United </v>

100
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 1>States Congress begins to fall apart in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a really dramatic and interesting way is</v>

101
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>when Newt Gingrich becomes speaker of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house.</v>

102
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>So when the Republicans take control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress in [inaudible] 95,</v>

103
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>so the first time</v>

104
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans have taken control of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the House of Representatives in 40 </v>

105
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:01.364
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the house becomes incredibly </v>

106
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each election,</v>

107
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is up for grabs.</v>

108
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:06.104
<v Speaker 2>Who's going to control the house?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Gingrich turns his members in the </v>

109
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 2>House into perpetual fundraisers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's basically we got raise the money to</v>

110
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 2>defend ourselves next time around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the Democrats followed suit.</v>

111
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.633
<v Speaker 2>So the Democrats turned their members </v>
<v Speaker 2>into perpetual fundraisers and they </v>

112
00:06:22.431 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 2>changed the rules about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who gets to be chairman of committees?</v>

113
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 2>It's no longer like who's the person </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the most experience,</v>

114
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:28.904
<v Speaker 2>with the most insight increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes who raises the most money and </v>

115
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know about the Democratic Party.</v>

116
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:35.624
<v Speaker 2>The Republicans don't talk to me much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Democratic Party increasingly </v>

117
00:06:37.611 --> 00:06:38.444
<v Speaker 2>changes its focus from what are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies that our members care about </v>

118
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:44.834
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to do to make sure </v>

119
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.770
<v Speaker 2>that you as a member meet your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundraising target?</v>

120
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.993
<v Speaker 2>And so from 95 until today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the institution becomes an institution </v>

121
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 2>focused on the game of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>reelected.</v>

122
00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.043
<v Speaker 2>I'm Jim Cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Democrat from Tennessee who went to </v>

123
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Congress first in 1983.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So He's been there for a long time.</v>

124
00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.333
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cooper says Capitol Hill has become a </v>

125
00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 2>kind of farm league forK street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

126
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 2>So what he means by that is members go </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

127
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.453
<v Speaker 2>they learn how to raise money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they become focused obsessively on </v>

128
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.473
<v Speaker 2>raising money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that they're </v>

129
00:07:18.231 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 2>really focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's how do they go from Capitol Hill to</v>

130
00:07:22.251 --> 00:07:25.310
<v Speaker 2>becoming a lobbyist because that's where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real money is.</v>

131
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 2>A member of Congress gets paid about as </v>
<v Speaker 2>much as the students.</v>

132
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:32.100
<v Speaker 2>I educate at the Harvard law school in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their first year as Lawyers Co.</v>

133
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 2>So to ordinary americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of money,</v>

134
00:07:34.281 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 2>but two people on capitol hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem like a lot of money,</v>

135
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 2>but then they go and become a lobbyist.</v>

136
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 2>They can make 10 timeS that as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobbyist.</v>

137
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.493
<v Speaker 2>And so what cooper says is you have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>institution which has become so focused </v>

138
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:51.281
<v Speaker 2>on the money that it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>institution for producing influence that</v>

139
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:54.164
<v Speaker 2>can be sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And first the congressmen are basically </v>

140
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.003
<v Speaker 2>sucking up to the people who wAnt to buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence and then the congressman </v>

141
00:08:00.471 --> 00:08:01.304
<v Speaker 2>become the people buying influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves because they're working as </v>

142
00:08:03.321 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists for these important interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're in the rigged game.</v>

143
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:10.760
<v Speaker 2>They understand how it gets rigged and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they work to rig it.</v>

144
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

145
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.770
<v Speaker 2>They see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see this as their,</v>

146
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 2>their business plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's their honeypot.</v>

147
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there is,</v>

148
00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:18.203
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the district is outside of </v>

149
00:08:19.701 --> 00:08:20.534
<v Speaker 2>Washington dc and Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's some ungodly number of </v>

150
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 2>wealthy people per capita where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

151
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 2>there's more lobbyists in that area than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else in the United States.</v>

152
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 2>And that's this giant collection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth,</v>

153
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

154
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Washington dc is an incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperous place.</v>

155
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:39.640
<v Speaker 2>And anybody who's been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

156
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.533
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long who've seen it for a long </v>

157
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:42.410
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>

158
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 2>I clerked there in the early 19 nineties</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was pretty grungy place,</v>

159
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's a really opulent city now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the golden city on the hill,</v>

160
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.603
<v Speaker 2>you know the ahs and the reason for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the amount of money that's been </v>

161
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.474
<v Speaker 2>poured into that district for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>purpose of buying influence to buy </v>

162
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:01.404
<v Speaker 2>legislation that makes it so these </v>
<v Speaker 2>inCumbent dinosaur corporations that </v>

163
00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 2>have protected themselves against </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition across tHe country can,</v>

164
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can continue to profit.</v>

165
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird place though because even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though it's incredibly wealthy,</v>

166
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:19.300
<v Speaker 2>it's also incredibly poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a vast different extra.</v>

167
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 2>The spectrum is really wide because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that was when in the nineties was</v>

168
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the marion barry time,</v>

169
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:26.664
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

170
00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:27.533
<v Speaker 2>so that was when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he won as mayor again when he </v>

171
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 2>came back after being arrested for </v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking crack and people are like,</v>

172
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:37.880
<v Speaker 2>whatever little crack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.190
<v Speaker 2>It was an ugly place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That and it's becoming,</v>

174
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grotesque place now from the,</v>

175
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 2>from the standpoint of the principles of</v>
<v Speaker 2>what america's supposed to be.</v>

176
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the privilege.</v>

177
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:48.954
<v Speaker 2>There are not people who are privileged </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they've elon musk like and </v>

178
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.813
<v Speaker 2>rented a great new product or they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked incredibly hard and competitive </v>

179
00:09:57.271 --> 00:09:58.104
<v Speaker 2>marketplace and succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're privileged because they've </v>

180
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:01.224
<v Speaker 2>leveraged influence in a corrupt system </v>
<v Speaker 2>to to profit and the people who are </v>

181
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 2>failing their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

182
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 2>a lot of reasons they're failing is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a competitive,</v>

183
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.160
<v Speaker 2>powerful economy that gives them the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities right now because that,</v>

184
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 2>that district,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington dc,</v>

185
00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.553
<v Speaker 2>because it's got no effective </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation is one of the worst </v>

186
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 2>represented districts in the country.</v>

187
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:23.993
<v Speaker 2>So essentially this all started out with</v>
<v Speaker 2>new green gingrich's group and they </v>

188
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.603
<v Speaker 2>decided to spend so much time </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on fundraising and then </v>

189
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 2>once that became successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone else followed suit.</v>

190
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

191
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 2>So the game became no longer how do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>legislate for America,</v>

192
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.333
<v Speaker 2>but how do we rally our troops to raise </v>
<v Speaker 2>the money we need to win in the next </v>

193
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.690
<v Speaker 2>election?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The game is just about the election.</v>

194
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

195
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:48.870
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother lives in hilton head,</v>

196
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 2>which is of course a very republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>district,</v>

197
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.340
<v Speaker 2>but they elected their first democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Cunningham and joe.</v>

198
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.920
<v Speaker 2>My moTher loved him and wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>support him.</v>

199
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:00.260
<v Speaker 2>My mother is a republican,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here he was.</v>

200
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.103
<v Speaker 2>She wanted to support a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I sent a check for on her behalf to </v>

201
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:06.780
<v Speaker 2>this democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day he was elected,</v>

202
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 2>he started raising money for the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>

203
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.973
<v Speaker 2>his whole focus from that moment on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now we started a big membership </v>

204
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:14.094
<v Speaker 2>organization or are they going to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>members to sort of help him sort of get </v>

205
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 2>back to congress the next time around.</v>

206
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:18.953
<v Speaker 2>Their sole focus is the elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is really different in the 19 </v>

207
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:25.230
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:27.630
<v Speaker 2>they would go to Washington for 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>

209
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:28.464
<v Speaker 2>they would do the work of governing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then for six months they do the work of </v>

210
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.800
<v Speaker 2>politicking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

211
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.713
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

212
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.223
<v Speaker 2>to a year and a half they could figure </v>
<v Speaker 2>out how to solve the problems of </v>

213
00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:38.154
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then for half a year they figured </v>

214
00:11:39.061 --> 00:11:42.060
<v Speaker 2>out how to get reelected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's no longer the game.</v>

215
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.020
<v Speaker 2>The game now is from day one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we raise the funds?</v>

216
00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 2>We need to make sure we can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>reelected.</v>

217
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.193
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with the democrats extraordinary </v>

218
00:11:51.361 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 2>turnaround in this last election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you be damn sure.</v>

219
00:11:53.801 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

220
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.640
<v Speaker 1>exactly the obsessive focus that we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be going into 20 slash 20.</v>

221
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>And if there's no other viable </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative,</v>

222
00:12:00.941 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>this is a game that they have to play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good people have to play at this point.</v>

223
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you can have the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who say,</v>

224
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.463
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to play this game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are some famous people who </v>

225
00:12:10.481 --> 00:12:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to play this game.</v>

226
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 1>Know alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasional cortez.</v>

227
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean she doesn't have to raise money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure,</v>

228
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.930
<v Speaker 1>and people on the right to you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are the famous people in,</v>

229
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to worry about this,</v>

230
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:27.931
<v Speaker 1>but the ordinary congress person knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the way the system is right now,</v>

231
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:29.043
<v Speaker 1>they've got an obsessive focus on how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise money in what they know that that </v>

232
00:12:32.741 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 1>means is they develop a sixth sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a constant awareness about how what they</v>

233
00:12:37.211 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 1>do will affect their ability to raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

234
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>becoming the words of the x files,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape shifters,</v>

235
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:43.713
<v Speaker 1>as they constantly adjust their views in</v>
<v Speaker 1>light of what they know will help them </v>

236
00:12:46.121 --> 00:12:46.954
<v Speaker 1>to raise money.</v>

237
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:48.273
<v Speaker 1>There was a congressman leslie burned </v>
<v Speaker 1>democrat from Virginia who describes </v>

238
00:12:51.231 --> 00:12:53.320
<v Speaker 1>that when she went to congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was told by a colleague,</v>

239
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.610
<v Speaker 1>quote always leaned to the green than to</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarify.</v>

240
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:58.301
<v Speaker 1>She went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:01.770
<v Speaker 1>he was not an environmentalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the point is like,</v>

242
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.703
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your heart of hearts which way you </v>

243
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>got to go to make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're good and you're smart,</v>

244
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:11.110
<v Speaker 1>you'd never say anything to indicate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's operating,</v>

245
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:15.280
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes you're not so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the tax bill,</v>

246
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:17.890
<v Speaker 1>the leading up to the passage of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last tax cut,</v>

247
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>the one point $6,000,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>gift to corporations and wealthy people,</v>

248
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>primarily a congressman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York stood on the floor of the house</v>

249
00:13:26.051 --> 00:13:26.770
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

250
00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:30.310
<v Speaker 1>my donors have told me that if we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver on this,</v>

251
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I should never call him again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should never call them again.</v>

252
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's basically as simple and clear as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

253
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>You don't reduce our taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever ask us for more money.</v>

254
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reality of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington has become.</v>

255
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.483
<v Speaker 1>Now once this gets started and it moves </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this direction that we don't have a </v>

256
00:13:49.391 --> 00:13:50.224
<v Speaker 1>long history of this to understand the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the waves and the ins and the outs of </v>

257
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:55.150
<v Speaker 1>the tide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>

258
00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.870
<v Speaker 1>this is just what it is and it keeps </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving in the same general direction.</v>

259
00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 1>How would that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ever stop?</v>

260
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.253
<v Speaker 1>How would there ever be some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reform that puts this back into a </v>

261
00:14:04.711 --> 00:14:06.520
<v Speaker 1>position where it makes sense and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tenable?</v>

262
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

263
00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I've been in this business for about 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years now in the business of like trying</v>

264
00:14:13.001 --> 00:14:18.001
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what can we do to reform </v>
<v Speaker 1>this corrupted system and you know,</v>

265
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:21.880
<v Speaker 1>part of me feels as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's hopeless,</v>

266
00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:22.714
<v Speaker 1>but part of me feels like it's the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>hopeful moments we've seen because like </v>

267
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:29.200
<v Speaker 1>a decade ago when I would go around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

268
00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:30.034
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got this really corrupted system and </v>

269
00:14:31.001 --> 00:14:31.834
<v Speaker 1>like money is people saying no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about we just have to </v>

270
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.850
<v Speaker 1>focus on getting the people we want </v>
<v Speaker 1>elected.</v>

271
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:39.450
<v Speaker 1>And if we get the people we want to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

272
00:14:39.451 --> 00:14:42.640
<v Speaker 1>we'll get the policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're past now,</v>

273
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.310
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody realizes that until we </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix this broken congress,</v>

274
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:49.683
<v Speaker 1>nothing else can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like this is the most </v>

275
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:52.250
<v Speaker 1>important</v>

276
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.270
<v Speaker 2>issue out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

277
00:14:53.271 --> 00:14:54.104
<v Speaker 2>you could think climate change or </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare or jobs or comp competitive </v>

278
00:14:56.531 --> 00:14:57.364
<v Speaker 2>mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could think those are the important </v>

279
00:14:58.191 --> 00:14:59.024
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what people are increasingly seeing </v>

280
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:04.340
<v Speaker 2>is that this is the first issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we don't fix this,</v>

281
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:05.713
<v Speaker 2>we don't fix anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's really encouraging to me is </v>

282
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:13.961
<v Speaker 2>that that frame is increasingly being </v>
<v Speaker 2>embraced by important leaders.</v>

283
00:15:14.051 --> 00:15:14.920
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

284
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:15.803
<v Speaker 2>about six years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think nancy pelosi was on jon </v>

285
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:21.890
<v Speaker 2>stewart's show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the daily show,</v>

286
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.390
<v Speaker 2>and stuart said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

287
00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.460
<v Speaker 2>the whole system is corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nancy pelosi's no,</v>

288
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

289
00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 2>the system's not corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People in the system are corrupt,</v>

290
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:29.954
<v Speaker 2>but the system is not corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And jon stewart just had a field day </v>

291
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:34.280
<v Speaker 2>because of how ridiculous that statement</v>
<v Speaker 2>is now.</v>

292
00:15:34.281 --> 00:15:38.810
<v Speaker 2>But now nancy polosi is gonna introduce </v>
<v Speaker 2>this hr one,</v>

293
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:40.933
<v Speaker 2>the most ambitious and comprehensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>reform package that Washington I think </v>

294
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:48.560
<v Speaker 2>has ever seen.</v>

295
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is unbelievable in its breadth.</v>

296
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.583
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it has public funding of </v>

297
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:58.190
<v Speaker 2>congressional campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that congressmen don't spend 30 to 70</v>

298
00:15:58.191 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 2>percent of their time sucking up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesters.</v>

299
00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.380
<v Speaker 2>It has a mandate to end gerrymandering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political partisan gerrymandering,</v>

300
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.920
<v Speaker 2>exercising congress's power under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution to tell the states,</v>

301
00:16:09.921 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 2>clean this mess up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has an incredible,</v>

302
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:16.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ethics package to kind of close,</v>

303
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:20.870
<v Speaker 2>block the revolving door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So congressmen are not running off the k</v>

304
00:16:20.871 --> 00:16:24.920
<v Speaker 2>street and it has an incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>restoration of voting rights.</v>

305
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:27.500
<v Speaker 2>The rest voter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a restoration of voting rights act,</v>

306
00:16:27.501 --> 00:16:28.334
<v Speaker 2>automatic voter registration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most comprehensive package of </v>

307
00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.413
<v Speaker 2>political reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the civil rights bill of the </v>

308
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:35.114
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course nobody outside of </v>

309
00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:37.454
<v Speaker 2>Washington has heard anything about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because most people look at what </v>

310
00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:41.504
<v Speaker 2>Washington does and says it's just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>game the democrats are playing to </v>

311
00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:45.350
<v Speaker 2>embarrass the republicans.</v>

312
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.130
<v Speaker 2>How will they stop congressmen from </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming lobbyists?</v>

313
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.301
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>

314
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.330
<v Speaker 2>they do a and then build loopholes into </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

315
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:55.580
<v Speaker 2>but one thing they can do is they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically say,</v>

316
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:57.850
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once your congressman,</v>

317
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 2>you can't be a lobbyist for five years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and five years or whatever the time is.</v>

318
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.010
<v Speaker 2>But the more fundamental factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

319
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.560
<v Speaker 2>if you change the way you fund </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigns,</v>

320
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.493
<v Speaker 2>if it was no longer the lobbyists who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are kind of channeling the money in or </v>

321
00:17:11.481 --> 00:17:15.590
<v Speaker 2>that we're getting their clients to </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel the money and then it's not like</v>

322
00:17:15.591 --> 00:17:18.980
<v Speaker 2>there wouldn't be lobbyists anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just wouldn't be so well paid.</v>

323
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:22.550
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't be as valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they're not as valuable,</v>

324
00:17:22.551 --> 00:17:23.384
<v Speaker 2>it's not as valuable for them to pay the</v>
<v Speaker 2>congressmen and incredible amount of </v>

325
00:17:25.761 --> 00:17:27.880
<v Speaker 2>money to become a lobbyist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

326
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:28.723
<v Speaker 2>they would become almost like lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy wonks that kind of go to capitol </v>

327
00:17:31.821 --> 00:17:32.654
<v Speaker 2>hill and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what will happen if you adopt </v>

328
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:35.720
<v Speaker 2>this legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

329
00:17:35.721 --> 00:17:37.460
<v Speaker 2>that's an important part of the process.</v>

330
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.920
<v Speaker 2>but they wouldn't be the mockers in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

331
00:17:39.921 --> 00:17:42.320
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't be the people who called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shots.</v>

332
00:17:42.321 --> 00:17:44.960
<v Speaker 2>And so the value of their services would</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall.</v>

333
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 2>And if the value of their services fell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it wouldn't so much sense to go and</v>

334
00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:51.114
<v Speaker 2>become a lobbyist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you'd come home and be a doctor </v>

335
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:53.724
<v Speaker 2>again or come home and like be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>businessperson again or do whatever you </v>

336
00:17:56.071 --> 00:17:56.904
<v Speaker 2>want back in your district.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think if you change the way you </v>

337
00:17:59.761 --> 00:18:00.594
<v Speaker 2>fund campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would change 70 percent of the </v>

338
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:05.790
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would just fix it right then.</v>

339
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.860
<v Speaker 2>And these other things are good </v>
<v Speaker 2>additions,</v>

340
00:18:07.861 --> 00:18:08.694
<v Speaker 2>but not as critical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But without changing the way you fund </v>

341
00:18:10.681 --> 00:18:11.514
<v Speaker 2>campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all of these other changes are </v>

342
00:18:13.531 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 2>relevant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't get over the money.</v>

343
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.240
<v Speaker 2>You always hear the phrase take money </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of politics.</v>

344
00:18:18.241 --> 00:18:21.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a constant phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really possible now.</v>

345
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.710
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think it's really good point</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't the point isn't to get money out.</v>

346
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.680
<v Speaker 2>The point is to get money that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent a tiny fraction of the special</v>

347
00:18:31.681 --> 00:18:35.460
<v Speaker 2>interests controlling how congress </v>
<v Speaker 2>people think.</v>

348
00:18:35.461 --> 00:18:36.294
<v Speaker 2>So I think today a congressman from </v>
<v Speaker 2>California rogue kahana is going to </v>

349
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.603
<v Speaker 2>introduce a bill that he hopes will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually part of whatever this big </v>

350
00:18:44.431 --> 00:18:45.264
<v Speaker 2>reform packages that would create a way </v>
<v Speaker 2>of funding campaigns where everybody </v>

351
00:18:48.991 --> 00:18:52.450
<v Speaker 2>gets a voucher or a set of vouchers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

352
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.303
<v Speaker 2>seattle has done this for city elections</v>
<v Speaker 2>where everybody gets for $25 vouchers </v>

353
00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:02.520
<v Speaker 2>that are only usable to fund campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a candidate comes around and tries to</v>

354
00:19:02.821 --> 00:19:03.654
<v Speaker 2>persuade you to give him or her the </v>
<v Speaker 2>voucher and then they take that voucher </v>

355
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:07.680
<v Speaker 2>and they use it to fund campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

356
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:08.873
<v Speaker 2>If roca han is bill passed and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 2>had vouchers to use to fund </v>

357
00:19:11.911 --> 00:19:12.744
<v Speaker 2>congressional campaigns and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea is basically you take the </v>

358
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:17.004
<v Speaker 2>rebate of the first $50 of your taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which every american pays at least $50 </v>

359
00:19:21.271 --> 00:19:22.110
<v Speaker 2>to the federal government.</v>

360
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.943
<v Speaker 2>You take that first $50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you give it back and you give it in the </v>

361
00:19:24.421 --> 00:19:25.254
<v Speaker 2>form of a voucher and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take this voucher and help fund </v>

362
00:19:28.081 --> 00:19:28.914
<v Speaker 2>campaigns with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congressmen would still be raising </v>

363
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:31.914
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd still be spending a lot of time </v>

364
00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:35.603
<v Speaker 2>raising money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they wouldn't be raising money from </v>

365
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:40.590
<v Speaker 2>the tiny fraction of the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be raising money from everybody.</v>

366
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.390
<v Speaker 2>And so the point is that you would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>using that money to spread the influence</v>

367
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.553
<v Speaker 2>in the way that democracy is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread the influence to every american </v>

368
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:54.270
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to the influence in a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny fraction of the one percent.</v>

369
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.733
<v Speaker 2>So that wouldn't get less money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that could be more money in the </v>

370
00:19:58.021 --> 00:19:58.854
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't be corrupting money </v>

371
00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.030
<v Speaker 2>because it would be money that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratically accountable,</v>

372
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.283
<v Speaker 2>but the lesters of the world would </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably try to put the kibosh on that </v>

373
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:08.910
<v Speaker 2>before it ever got movement.</v>

374
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:09.361
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

375
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:12.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest block to anything like hr,</v>

376
00:20:12.471 --> 00:20:13.304
<v Speaker 2>one happening is that the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential people in Washington have </v>

377
00:20:18.031 --> 00:20:19.830
<v Speaker 2>the most to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

378
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.090
<v Speaker 2>The lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

379
00:20:21.091 --> 00:20:21.924
<v Speaker 2>the value of the industry of lobbying </v>
<v Speaker 2>just collapses and those people are </v>

380
00:20:25.411 --> 00:20:29.970
<v Speaker 2>going to fight like hell to block it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is why as wonderful as it is to me</v>

381
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:32.640
<v Speaker 2>to see somebody like nancy polosi take </v>
<v Speaker 2>up the charge and say,</v>

382
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:33.474
<v Speaker 2>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a package of reform and it's </v>

383
00:20:34.681 --> 00:20:37.410
<v Speaker 2>going to be the first thing we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fix democracy first.</v>

384
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.150
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's true?</v>

385
00:20:39.151 --> 00:20:43.830
<v Speaker 2>What's obvious about this is without a </v>
<v Speaker 2>president taking up the charge,</v>

386
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 2>it's never gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's most depressing to</v>

387
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:49.570
<v Speaker 1>is that right now in the democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>

388
00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:50.404
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any candidate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>president who's making reform a even an </v>

389
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:57.010
<v Speaker 1>important issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone a primary issue.</v>

390
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.490
<v Speaker 1>And of courSe we had a president who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>elected under the drain,</v>

391
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:01.324
<v Speaker 1>the swamp slogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course nobody believes he has an </v>

392
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 1>implant or have any intent to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything to drain that swamp.</v>

393
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.313
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping that having him in office is </v>

394
00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 1>such a that the whole thing was such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cluster fuck and that so many people are</v>

395
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:16.354
<v Speaker 1>so disturbed that it's going to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>people more politically active and more </v>

396
00:21:19.031 --> 00:21:22.300
<v Speaker 1>aware of the consequences of having </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like that in office.</v>

397
00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:23.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually weirdly unifying because </v>

398
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 1>even though the democrats are not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this right now,</v>

399
00:21:31.301 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 1>which is really depressing to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

400
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.753
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have these things that we know we </v>

401
00:21:35.591 --> 00:21:36.424
<v Speaker 1>disagree about and we like fueled the </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics of hate as we kind of yell at </v>

402
00:21:42.221 --> 00:21:43.420
<v Speaker 1>each other about these things.</v>

403
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.410
<v Speaker 1>BuT there's a set of issues that we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree about and the,</v>

404
00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:48.353
<v Speaker 1>and the most important set of issues we </v>
<v Speaker 1>all agree about is the deeply corrupted </v>

405
00:21:51.311 --> 00:21:52.144
<v Speaker 1>nature of this government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a poll done by university </v>

406
00:21:54.071 --> 00:21:55.550
<v Speaker 1>of Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of 2016,</v>

407
00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:56.883
<v Speaker 1>asking about anger and frustration with </v>
<v Speaker 1>government found the highest level of </v>

408
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:05.020
<v Speaker 1>frustration in the history of polling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they asked the reasons why</v>

409
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:07.660
<v Speaker 1>they were so angry and so disaffected </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their government,</v>

410
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:11.350
<v Speaker 1>the reasons people gave were all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same things like the influence of money,</v>

411
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:14.800
<v Speaker 1>the influence of lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parties care more about corporations</v>

412
00:22:14.801 --> 00:22:15.634
<v Speaker 1>and about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then then we broke them down about </v>

413
00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Speaker 1>how to republicans think about this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the democrats think about this.</v>

414
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:24.010
<v Speaker 1>There was no statistical difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between republicans and democrats.</v>

415
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the democrats were more </v>

416
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:27.124
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the republicans and the </v>

417
00:22:28.121 --> 00:22:31.030
<v Speaker 1>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're at like 80 and 90 percent.</v>

418
00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:31.863
<v Speaker 1>So literally 84 percent of americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>would say it is big money that is </v>

419
00:22:34.961 --> 00:22:37.690
<v Speaker 1>corrupting the way our congress </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>

420
00:22:37.691 --> 00:22:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here is common ground.</v>

421
00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:41.253
<v Speaker 1>And what was so extraordinarY about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 election is watched a republican </v>

422
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 1>candidates stand on a debate stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In september of twentY 15,</v>

423
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.133
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump stood on a debate stage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointed to every one of those kennedy's </v>

424
00:22:52.181 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I own all of you.</v>

425
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.333
<v Speaker 1>I've given all of you money and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>The way the system works and the system </v>

426
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:57.724
<v Speaker 1>is corrupt and he called super pacs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>abomination and he attacked the idea of </v>

427
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:06.271
<v Speaker 1>money in politics and so what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>signaled is that republicans to could be</v>

428
00:23:06.521 --> 00:23:11.440
<v Speaker 1>rallied to this cause of addressing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply corrupted political system.</v>

429
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 1>If only we could find the candidates who</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do it,</v>

430
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.420
<v Speaker 1>and I think what Donald Trump has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>is teed up this moment where we can step</v>

431
00:23:19.421 --> 00:23:20.111
<v Speaker 1>back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

432
00:23:20.111 --> 00:23:24.910
<v Speaker 1>we disagree about a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's gmo or climate change,</v>

433
00:23:24.911 --> 00:23:27.250
<v Speaker 1>whether it's healthcare for all or </v>
<v Speaker 1>college for all,</v>

434
00:23:27.251 --> 00:23:28.760
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We disagree about a loving.</v>

435
00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:32.560
<v Speaker 1>We got to work a lot of things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here is something we all agree about</v>

436
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.190
<v Speaker 1>and we should be smart enough to realize</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't fix this,</v>

437
00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:39.940
<v Speaker 1>the none of the things we're arguing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about matter.</v>

438
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:40.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

439
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.793
<v Speaker 1>It's not serious to stand on a debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and say you you support single </v>

440
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:46.214
<v Speaker 1>payer healthcare</v>

441
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.103
<v Speaker 2>without also saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but first we're going to fix this </v>

442
00:23:49.551 --> 00:23:50.384
<v Speaker 2>corrupted system because there's no way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get single payer healthcare in a </v>

443
00:23:53.421 --> 00:23:54.254
<v Speaker 2>world where doctors and pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies and insurance companies are </v>

444
00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:57.644
<v Speaker 2>funding elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say you're goIng to get </v>

445
00:23:59.301 --> 00:24:00.134
<v Speaker 2>climate change legislation in America </v>
<v Speaker 2>without addressing the corrupting </v>

446
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:04.634
<v Speaker 2>influence of money in politics because </v>
<v Speaker 2>the oil camp that the dirty energy </v>

447
00:24:07.461 --> 00:24:11.630
<v Speaker 2>industry has an enormous opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>block this,</v>

448
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:13.710
<v Speaker 2>changed through the way we fund </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>

449
00:24:13.711 --> 00:24:14.544
<v Speaker 2>So this is a moment where we should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to get everybody in this political </v>

450
00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:19.670
<v Speaker 2>system to step back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

451
00:24:19.671 --> 00:24:22.070
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The system is broken.</v>

452
00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:22.904
<v Speaker 2>We can see as broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing we have to do is to fix </v>

453
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.220
<v Speaker 2>the broken congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if we fix that congress,</v>

454
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:29.593
<v Speaker 2>then we have a chance to have an </v>
<v Speaker 2>argument about what policy makes sense </v>

455
00:24:31.911 --> 00:24:33.770
<v Speaker 2>for America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we each have our views,</v>

456
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:34.970
<v Speaker 2>but no views are different.</v>

457
00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.880
<v Speaker 2>But the thing we don't agree about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should be able to agree on.</v>

458
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.493
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's a universal agreement amongst </v>

459
00:24:41.031 --> 00:24:41.864
<v Speaker 2>republicans and democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that funding and that money and that </v>

460
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this is what's ruining politics.</v>

461
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:51.740
<v Speaker 2>The people that are donating all this </v>
<v Speaker 2>moneY,</v>

462
00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

463
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:57.980
<v Speaker 2>the lesters of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what could they possibly do to stop this</v>

464
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:01.550
<v Speaker 2>reform and what's their reaction to this</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of reform?</v>

465
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>YeAh.</v>

466
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.610
<v Speaker 2>So let me be clear about one really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important thing.</v>

467
00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:07.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I say republicans and democrats,</v>

468
00:25:07.641 --> 00:25:11.090
<v Speaker 2>what I mean as people in the districts </v>
<v Speaker 2>across America,</v>

469
00:25:11.091 --> 00:25:14.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean in Washington like mitch </v>
<v Speaker 2>mcconnell is,</v>

470
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.330
<v Speaker 2>I think the focus of evil in the modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

471
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Mitch mcconnell will block any reform </v>
<v Speaker 2>here at all.</v>

472
00:25:21.831 --> 00:25:22.341
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

473
00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:23.174
<v Speaker 2>nancy polozi can offer what she wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'll never get through the senate </v>

474
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:28.380
<v Speaker 2>because mitch mcconnell and so there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>many republicans in Washington.</v>

475
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.440
<v Speaker 2>We're going to block any reform.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

476
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:31.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you ask,</v>

477
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:32.594
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the republicans in Washington and the </v>

478
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:37.130
<v Speaker 2>lesters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can they do to stop it?</v>

479
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the game,</v>

480
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:42.110
<v Speaker 2>the game strategy's clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've deployed it before,</v>

481
00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.073
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

482
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

483
00:25:43.991 --> 00:25:45.320
<v Speaker 2>they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll say things like,</v>

484
00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:48.890
<v Speaker 2>this is welfare for politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

485
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.920
<v Speaker 2>this is just corrupting free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't believe in the first amendment</v>

486
00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:58.460
<v Speaker 2>if you don't believe that the koch </v>
<v Speaker 2>brothers or the soros is,</v>

487
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:02.000
<v Speaker 2>have the right to spend unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money and political speech.</v>

488
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think the Way around that fight</v>

489
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.453
<v Speaker 2>is to agree free speech is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental value and nothing of the </v>

490
00:26:12.831 --> 00:26:16.820
<v Speaker 2>reforms I support would like try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrict people's ability to speak.</v>

491
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:20.480
<v Speaker 2>What we're talking about is congressman </v>
<v Speaker 2>raising money.</v>

492
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.540
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about inDividuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking in the marketplaCe.</v>

493
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:24.950
<v Speaker 2>So you have a very loud voice.</v>

494
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:25.783
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your voice is heard by millions and </v>

495
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.083
<v Speaker 2>nothing in our constitution should </v>
<v Speaker 2>permit the goVernment to be able to </v>

496
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:32.593
<v Speaker 2>suppress you at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so long as you're within the bounds of </v>

497
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:39.680
<v Speaker 2>decency or at least not decency because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a bound boundary.</v>

498
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.730
<v Speaker 2>This thought guests obeys often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least if you're not,</v>

499
00:26:43.731 --> 00:26:45.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading false rumors and causing great</v>

500
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:47.640
<v Speaker 2>harm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is,</v>

501
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 2>even though this free speech needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>protected,</v>

502
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.490
<v Speaker 2>we still should be able to focus on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence,</v>

503
00:26:56.491 --> 00:26:57.324
<v Speaker 2>the economy of influence congressmen </v>
<v Speaker 2>live under when they spend 30 to 70 </v>

504
00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 2>percent of the time sucking up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lesters to fund their campaigns.</v>

505
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.173
<v Speaker 2>That should be a focus of regulation </v>
<v Speaker 2>without the first amendment getting in </v>

506
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:10.194
<v Speaker 2>the way because we want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress filled with people who care </v>

507
00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:12.924
<v Speaker 2>about what their voters want now with </v>
<v Speaker 2>their funders want the framers didn't </v>

508
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:20.640
<v Speaker 2>create a constitution to replicate an </v>
<v Speaker 2>aristocracy.</v>

509
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.473
<v Speaker 2>They were fighting and aristocracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a system where there was a </v>

510
00:27:24.151 --> 00:27:24.984
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the house of lords that had to ask the </v>

511
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 2>aristocracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>

512
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.860
<v Speaker 2>And everything could be blocked if the </v>
<v Speaker 2>aristocracy didn't like it.</v>

513
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:32.694
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've replicated that system more </v>

514
00:27:33.931 --> 00:27:36.300
<v Speaker 2>efficiently in America than they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

515
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.313
<v Speaker 2>Because we have a system where both the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house of representatives and the senate </v>

516
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:40.763
<v Speaker 2>is filled with people who are obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a single question what to my </v>

517
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:45.144
<v Speaker 2>funders want?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if they can't answer that question </v>

518
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.693
<v Speaker 2>in a way that supports the legislation </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're not going to support the </v>

519
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:53.634
<v Speaker 2>legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if it's important for them to block </v>

520
00:27:55.471 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 2>legislation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will block legislation.</v>

521
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.760
<v Speaker 2>And that's the dynamic of Washington </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

522
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Francis fukuyama describes our </v>
<v Speaker 2>government as a veto ocracy veto ocracy.</v>

523
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 2>And what he means by that is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many places were influenced.</v>

524
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.293
<v Speaker 2>Powerful influence can block the ability</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the government to do something that </v>

525
00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:17.490
<v Speaker 2>it just can't do anything anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

526
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:18.803
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequence of allowing this </v>

527
00:28:20.671 --> 00:28:25.260
<v Speaker 2>corruption of money to be so deeply </v>
<v Speaker 2>woven into our political system.</v>

528
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.350
<v Speaker 2>Is it possible to fix?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

529
00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.460
<v Speaker 2>it is possible to fix because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>

530
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.470
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hr one plus roca,</v>

531
00:28:35.471 --> 00:28:38.820
<v Speaker 2>honda's bill all perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutional.</v>

532
00:28:38.821 --> 00:28:40.410
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't have to amend the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution to do it.</v>

533
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I think that bill alone would solve 80 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the problem.</v>

534
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.013
<v Speaker 2>The possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem isn't like conceiving of </v>

535
00:28:47.431 --> 00:28:48.264
<v Speaker 2>what changes have to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is how do you build the </v>

536
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:50.844
<v Speaker 2>political movement to get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what that takes is leaders willing </v>

537
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:54.594
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to fix this corrupted democracy </v>

538
00:28:57.931 --> 00:29:00.600
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And leaders who stopped,</v>

539
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.453
<v Speaker 2>like pretending that we can get like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>christmas list of great changes in </v>

540
00:29:06.961 --> 00:29:08.970
<v Speaker 2>government without fixing this democracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

541
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:09.391
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

542
00:29:09.391 --> 00:29:10.224
<v Speaker 2>bernie published last month in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington post list of the 10 things </v>

543
00:29:15.271 --> 00:29:16.104
<v Speaker 2>that should happen in the first hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>days in the next democratic </v>

544
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:20.730
<v Speaker 2>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 great ideas.</v>

545
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.410
<v Speaker 2>Not a single one of those ideas address </v>
<v Speaker 2>the corruption of our political system.</v>

546
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.553
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just,</v>

547
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.250
<v Speaker 2>it was just a christmas list of all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that the progressives want.</v>

548
00:29:30.251 --> 00:29:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Did you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a progressive.</v>

549
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:32.154
<v Speaker 2>I want some of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is like what things were </v>

550
00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:34.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

551
00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:35.223
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like a trillion dollar </v>

552
00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:39.930
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single pair healthcare free college,</v>

553
00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:40.801
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

554
00:29:40.801 --> 00:29:41.634
<v Speaker 2>all things that bernie is pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has made so salad and things that I </v>

555
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 2>think it's great that he has made sale </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet.</v>

556
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a hero and like making these issues</v>

557
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:49.174
<v Speaker 2>central to at least the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what frustrates me is that instead </v>

558
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:56.560
<v Speaker 2>of focusing our anger on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>billionaires,</v>

559
00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:57.394
<v Speaker 2>which he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to focus more anger on the </v>

560
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 2>congressman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the politicians,</v>

561
00:30:01.211 --> 00:30:03.100
<v Speaker 2>which he does not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

562
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:05.440
<v Speaker 2>the guy's been in congress romas 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years now,</v>

563
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.280
<v Speaker 2>and so it might be natural for him not </v>
<v Speaker 2>to notice that the people around him are</v>

564
00:30:09.281 --> 00:30:10.114
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>

565
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:11.023
<v Speaker 3>Is it a natural thing or do you think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's possibly aware of the </v>

566
00:30:14.661 --> 00:30:17.720
<v Speaker 3>consequences of stirring up that hornets</v>
<v Speaker 3>nest?</v>

567
00:30:17.721 --> 00:30:20.600
<v Speaker 3>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if anybody has a right to complain,</v>

568
00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:24.920
<v Speaker 3>when the dnc conspired to rig the </v>
<v Speaker 3>primaries against him,</v>

569
00:30:24.921 --> 00:30:25.754
<v Speaker 3>he's the number one guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He should be screaming from the </v>

570
00:30:27.771 --> 00:30:29.690
<v Speaker 3>rooftops.</v>
<v Speaker 3>YoU're dealing with a corrupt system and</v>

571
00:30:29.691 --> 00:30:31.310
<v Speaker 3>thiS is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't.</v>

572
00:30:31.311 --> 00:30:32.144
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he didn't do that while hillary </v>

573
00:30:34.371 --> 00:30:36.620
<v Speaker 3>clinton was running for president and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>knew it.</v>

574
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.290
<v Speaker 3>He knew he hAd been screwed out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>primaries.</v>

575
00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:42.290
<v Speaker 3>He knew they had conspired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he knew it was all illegal,</v>

576
00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.750
<v Speaker 3>and he kind of just kept his mouth shut.</v>

577
00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:45.421
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

578
00:30:45.421 --> 00:30:46.254
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

579
00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.900
<v Speaker 2>that was a responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was a kind of.</v>

580
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.113
<v Speaker 2>I was a person reflecting on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrendous outcome if he took hillary </v>

581
00:30:57.211 --> 00:31:00.060
<v Speaker 2>clinton down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think he restrained himself,</v>

582
00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not perfectly.</v>

583
00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is,</v>

584
00:31:02.041 --> 00:31:04.290
<v Speaker 2>after it was clear he was not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the nominee,</v>

585
00:31:04.291 --> 00:31:07.710
<v Speaker 2>he still continued to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption around hillary,</v>

586
00:31:07.711 --> 00:31:11.730
<v Speaker 2>which donald then picked up and turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a weapon against her.</v>

587
00:31:11.731 --> 00:31:13.200
<v Speaker 2>But I think he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he recognized,</v>

588
00:31:13.201 --> 00:31:14.034
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as every responsible politician does </v>

589
00:31:15.571 --> 00:31:16.260
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

590
00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:19.440
<v Speaker 2>it's not just about him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about the future of America.</v>

591
00:31:19.441 --> 00:31:22.530
<v Speaker 2>So when he restrained himself and didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to take the whole system down,</v>

592
00:31:22.531 --> 00:31:26.430
<v Speaker 2>then I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm talking about now,</v>

593
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:27.773
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about when you've got the </v>
<v Speaker 2>house of representatives talking about </v>

594
00:31:30.331 --> 00:31:33.180
<v Speaker 2>fundamental reform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be the first thing they take up.</v>

595
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:36.750
<v Speaker 2>We at least ought to have a presidential</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign where candidates are saying,</v>

596
00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:39.630
<v Speaker 2>hell yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing we will do is to end the</v>

597
00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:40.464
<v Speaker 2>corruption that makes it impossible for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this congress to function and stop </v>

598
00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:44.034
<v Speaker 2>pretending like we can get all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful things given to us by santa </v>

599
00:31:48.271 --> 00:31:52.110
<v Speaker 2>claus without fixing this first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta do the hard work of convincing</v>

600
00:31:52.111 --> 00:31:54.900
<v Speaker 2>America that there is a solution because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:55.783
<v Speaker 2>the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most of America is where you </v>

602
00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:57.983
<v Speaker 2>started this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of America thinks it's deeply </v>

603
00:32:00.511 --> 00:32:02.730
<v Speaker 2>corrupted and there's nothing that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be done.</v>

604
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.790
<v Speaker 2>They're half right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is deeply corrupted,</v>

605
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing that can be done.</v>

606
00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.830
<v Speaker 2>We can do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>

607
00:32:10.831 --> 00:32:14.460
<v Speaker 2>I think we can solve almost 80 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

608
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.720
<v Speaker 2>I still think there's constitutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes that might be necessary.</v>

609
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:19.583
<v Speaker 2>And I've been working like how do we get</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutional changes and talking to </v>

610
00:32:22.501 --> 00:32:23.510
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

611
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.913
<v Speaker 2>my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course has about one 1000th of </v>

612
00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:28.223
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1000000th of the people listening to </v>

613
00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.870
<v Speaker 2>yours does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is your podcast?</v>

614
00:32:30.871 --> 00:32:32.640
<v Speaker 2>So people can listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another Way.</v>

615
00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.773
<v Speaker 2>so season two is released today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about an article five </v>

616
00:32:35.941 --> 00:32:36.774
<v Speaker 2>convention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but season one was about how to think </v>

617
00:32:38.131 --> 00:32:40.110
<v Speaker 2>about the 2020.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

618
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:41.591
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

619
00:32:41.591 --> 00:32:42.424
<v Speaker 1>I think that we might have to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutional change anD I have been </v>

620
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:47.330
<v Speaker 1>supporting the efforts to think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

621
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 1>But while we've got to do is to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>people a sense that there's something we</v>

622
00:32:51.141 --> 00:32:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Can do before we amend the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

623
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.920
<v Speaker 1>we did a poll and found 96 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>americans believe it important to reduce</v>

624
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:00.854
<v Speaker 1>the influence of money in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety one percent didn't think it was </v>

625
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:06.110
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the politics of resignation.</v>

626
00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.473
<v Speaker 1>If you'd gone to Egypt under mubarak and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd start the average person in the </v>

627
00:33:10.761 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 1>street and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

628
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.550
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bark.</v>

629
00:33:13.551 --> 00:33:14.750
<v Speaker 1>They would've said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.090
<v Speaker 1>we hate mubarak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then say,</v>

631
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.180
<v Speaker 1>well why aren't you doing anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

632
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:19.160
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because nothing can be done.</v>

633
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>african americans in 1900 and America,</v>

634
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.090
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about jim crow?</v>

635
00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.000
<v Speaker 1>We hate jim crow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you doing anything about it?</v>

636
00:33:26.001 --> 00:33:27.440
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's nothing to be done about</v>

637
00:33:27.441 --> 00:33:27.681
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

638
00:33:27.681 --> 00:33:30.830
<v Speaker 1>that's how americans think about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>political corruption.</v>

639
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.670
<v Speaker 1>They hate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's deeply unjust,</v>

640
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.040
<v Speaker 1>inconsistent with what they thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>America was about.</v>

641
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:38.743
<v Speaker 1>But they don't do anything about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't think there's </v>

642
00:33:40.491 --> 00:33:44.750
<v Speaker 1>anything to be done about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where leaders have a role and</v>

643
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:45.584
<v Speaker 1>what we need our leaders running for </v>
<v Speaker 1>president right now to begin to explain </v>

644
00:33:48.621 --> 00:33:52.460
<v Speaker 1>to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we could do if only we built</v>

645
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:53.294
<v Speaker 1>the power to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing the most important </v>

646
00:33:56.661 --> 00:33:57.494
<v Speaker 1>opposition here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lobbyist in wAshington are going to </v>

647
00:33:59.481 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 1>be an incredibly difficult group to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeat,</v>

648
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.570
<v Speaker 1>but we can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we do that,</v>

649
00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.130
<v Speaker 1>every other issue becomes easier to </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolve in a sensible way.</v>

650
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no public support for </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobbyists,</v>

651
00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:13.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

652
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.143
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no people out there that are </v>

653
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:15.374
<v Speaker 1>super psyched that lobbyists are out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and exerting their influence on </v>

654
00:34:18.981 --> 00:34:19.814
<v Speaker 1>our world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they obviously have enormous </v>

655
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:27.690
<v Speaker 1>financial backing behind them and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have incredible influence in our,</v>

656
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:32.570
<v Speaker 1>in our culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you had some magic wand,</v>

657
00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.560
<v Speaker 1>you could wave across this system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix it,</v>

658
00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:40.790
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't removing lobbyists be one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first things that you would do?</v>

659
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.900
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

660
00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:42.983
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why so?</v>

661
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.903
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because look,</v>

662
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress,</v>

663
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.843
<v Speaker 1>especially in the current government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislates on a whole bunch of issues </v>

664
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:50.833
<v Speaker 1>that they don't have a clue about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know squat diddly about 99 </v>

665
00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:56.360
<v Speaker 1>percent of what they're legislating </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>

666
00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.523
<v Speaker 1>They need information and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other things gingrich did was to </v>

667
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:05.270
<v Speaker 1>completely macerate congress's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>information service.</v>

668
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:06.104
<v Speaker 1>They used to have a really powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>information service to help congressmen </v>

669
00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 1>figure things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of that's basically gone,</v>

670
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Speaker 1>so they rely on outsiders to come in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>help them understand it.</v>

671
00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Now my view is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

672
00:35:16.611 --> 00:35:17.444
<v Speaker 1>that's an imperfect system because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's great inequality among the </v>

673
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:21.524
<v Speaker 1>quality of lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if all lobbyists were doing was </v>

674
00:35:24.801 --> 00:35:28.220
<v Speaker 1>providing information like congressmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what's going to happen.</v>

675
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.113
<v Speaker 1>If you pass this bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these jobs will disappear or this </v>

676
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:36.830
<v Speaker 1>lead will reappear in the water system </v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's all they were doing.</v>

677
00:35:36.831 --> 00:35:38.220
<v Speaker 1>That's really valuable thing.</v>

678
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:39.083
<v Speaker 2>Information to the congress to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>congress decide what to do is an </v>

679
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:42.804
<v Speaker 2>essential part of making democracy work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The part of lobbying that is the </v>

680
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 2>corrupting part where they become the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mockers for the money,</v>

681
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.080
<v Speaker 2>not so much that they give it directly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

682
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:54.923
<v Speaker 2>they call their clients and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need everybody at the c level in </v>

683
00:35:57.871 --> 00:35:59.940
<v Speaker 2>your corporation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Descend $2,700</v>

684
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:04.260
<v Speaker 2>to this person and they steer it like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that when they become the kInd of source</v>

685
00:36:04.261 --> 00:36:09.261
<v Speaker 2>of a resource for members of congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when they have thIs influence,</v>

686
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.570
<v Speaker 2>which is not related to their argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

687
00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:16.350
<v Speaker 2>I've met lobbyists who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who hate the system as it is right now.</v>

688
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.820
<v Speaker 2>They'll say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

689
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:21.120
<v Speaker 2>I want a system where I win because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas are good,</v>

690
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:22.523
<v Speaker 2>my arguments are better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a system where I win </v>

691
00:36:24.481 --> 00:36:25.314
<v Speaker 2>because I'm able to channel more money </v>
<v Speaker 2>than that guy because that's not a </v>

692
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:28.914
<v Speaker 2>democracy like at democracy should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These representatives are listening to </v>

693
00:36:31.201 --> 00:36:32.034
<v Speaker 2>us and then they do the right thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on what they think helps their </v>

694
00:36:35.431 --> 00:36:36.264
<v Speaker 2>constituents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not how much they're going to raise if </v>

695
00:36:38.071 --> 00:36:39.180
<v Speaker 2>they do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over that.</v>

696
00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:44.490
<v Speaker 2>How many lobbyists are there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

697
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.110
<v Speaker 2>I can't answer that question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

698
00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:47.333
<v Speaker 2>one of the big problems we've got is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the law has been weakened in </v>

699
00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:52.260
<v Speaker 2>registering lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

700
00:36:52.261 --> 00:36:53.094
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have tens of thousands of people who </v>

701
00:36:54.151 --> 00:36:54.984
<v Speaker 2>are functioning effectively of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists but don't have to call </v>

702
00:36:56.731 --> 00:36:57.564
<v Speaker 2>themselves lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have these members of congress who </v>

703
00:36:59.941 --> 00:37:00.774
<v Speaker 2>go to government relations departments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they oversee the government </v>

704
00:37:04.591 --> 00:37:05.424
<v Speaker 2>relations department as long as they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't go on to capitol hill and shake </v>

705
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:08.394
<v Speaker 2>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead set up the meetings on </v>

706
00:37:10.021 --> 00:37:12.210
<v Speaker 2>capitol hill with lower people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shaking hands.</v>

707
00:37:12.211 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 2>They're not called lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at the lobbying numbers,</v>

708
00:37:15.691 --> 00:37:16.524
<v Speaker 2>it looks like we peaked in lobbying </v>
<v Speaker 2>about three years ago and now are </v>

709
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:19.674
<v Speaker 2>declining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what that is in fact is that the </v>

710
00:37:21.961 --> 00:37:26.790
<v Speaker 2>rules have been interpreted or allowed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be unenforced so that many people who</v>

711
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:30.180
<v Speaker 2>are lobbyists actually aren't actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning as lobbyists today.</v>

712
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.223
<v Speaker 2>So they are lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't wear the label is </v>

713
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:34.440
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do they call themselves?</v>

714
00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Government relations people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Experts.</v>

715
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

716
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:39.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they aren't.</v>

717
00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 2>They say they're not technically </v>
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists.</v>

718
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.410
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

719
00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I got into a huge fight with Scott </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown.</v>

720
00:37:47.851 --> 00:37:52.851
<v Speaker 2>You remember Scott Brown who ran a for </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a senator in Massachusetts.</v>

721
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:58.620
<v Speaker 2>He ran under tea party ticket and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this amazing republican to win as a</v>

722
00:37:58.621 --> 00:38:01.890
<v Speaker 2>senator in Massachusetts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Elizabeth Warren,</v>

723
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:04.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm defeated him in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

724
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.770
<v Speaker 2>in the election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years into his term,</v>

725
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.343
<v Speaker 2>he then went to Massachusetts to New </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hampshire and ran for senate and I was </v>

726
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:15.930
<v Speaker 2>helping a republican in New Hampshire </v>
<v Speaker 2>who was a reformer running for senate,</v>

727
00:38:15.931 --> 00:38:19.750
<v Speaker 2>and we've referred to him as a lobbyist </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he went ballistic.</v>

728
00:38:19.751 --> 00:38:21.030
<v Speaker 2>He saId,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a lobbyist,</v>

729
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:23.700
<v Speaker 2>and then he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not technically a lobbyist.</v>

730
00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.810
<v Speaker 2>He's a government relations person who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like calling people on capitol hill.</v>

731
00:38:27.811 --> 00:38:30.420
<v Speaker 2>He used to be with the senate trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get them to do things for him,</v>

732
00:38:30.421 --> 00:38:34.410
<v Speaker 2>but he hasn't quite a technical labia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so merely because the irs wouldn't refer</v>

733
00:38:34.411 --> 00:38:35.244
<v Speaker 2>to them as a lobbyist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he thought it was outrageous and fraud </v>

734
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.920
<v Speaker 2>for me to refer to them as what we all </v>
<v Speaker 2>know he is,</v>

735
00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:45.250
<v Speaker 2>which is a lobbyist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So lobbyists,</v>

736
00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.560
<v Speaker 2>being a lobbyist is not defined by your </v>
<v Speaker 2>actions.</v>

737
00:38:47.561 --> 00:38:48.394
<v Speaker 2>It's defined by your label.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's defined by did you have to fill </v>

738
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 2>something out to be alumni as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you are a lobbyist,</v>

739
00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:56.643
<v Speaker 2>according to the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got all sorts of obligations of </v>

740
00:38:58.241 --> 00:39:01.150
<v Speaker 2>reporting who you're spending your time </v>
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>

741
00:39:01.151 --> 00:39:03.580
<v Speaker 2>What you're spending money on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government relations,</v>

742
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.013
<v Speaker 2>government relations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people at a certain level that do </v>

743
00:39:06.671 --> 00:39:07.504
<v Speaker 2>certain things aren't caught lobbyists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet they have the exact same </v>

744
00:39:09.491 --> 00:39:13.570
<v Speaker 2>function even more because they've got </v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of people working for them.</v>

745
00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.660
<v Speaker 2>They can deploy in their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their work of doing lobbying.</v>

746
00:39:17.770 --> 00:39:21.640
<v Speaker 2>How would that ever be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you ever put a dam up there?</v>

747
00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.450
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

748
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:25.363
<v Speaker 2>you only put a dam up there if you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got the political will to make it </v>

749
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:29.404
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

750
00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.570
<v Speaker 2>You only get the political will to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>it happen.</v>

751
00:39:31.571 --> 00:39:32.404
<v Speaker 2>If you have a political process that </v>
<v Speaker 2>focuses America on this deeply </v>

752
00:39:35.441 --> 00:39:37.360
<v Speaker 2>corrupting problem and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>god damn it,</v>

753
00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:40.630
<v Speaker 2>we have to fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you had that will,</v>

754
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.190
<v Speaker 2>if you said we're just going to fix </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

755
00:39:42.191 --> 00:39:43.770
<v Speaker 2>and you had like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

756
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.740
<v Speaker 2>the geeks then go down the list of 25 </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that have to happen to make it so</v>

757
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:48.574
<v Speaker 2>we have our congress is worried about </v>
<v Speaker 2>being representative of America as </v>

758
00:39:52.331 --> 00:39:55.870
<v Speaker 2>opposed to representative of the lesters</v>
<v Speaker 2>in America.</v>

759
00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.960
<v Speaker 2>We could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not rocket science.</v>

760
00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:00.520
<v Speaker 2>It really is not that hard.</v>

761
00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.330
<v Speaker 2>You got to think carefully about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of incentives you're producing.</v>

762
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:05.164
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to sketch the full plan </v>

763
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:08.284
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's possible it is constitutional </v>

764
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:14.320
<v Speaker 2>to do it and if we just built the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political will to to get there,</v>

765
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:16.600
<v Speaker 2>we could do it and the only way build </v>
<v Speaker 2>the political will.</v>

766
00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.560
<v Speaker 2>It's really important right now because </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now people,</v>

767
00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.693
<v Speaker 2>especially people like you need to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying to every one of the politicians </v>

768
00:40:24.671 --> 00:40:25.504
<v Speaker 2>who is going to be sucking up to try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be on your show to try to have a chance </v>

769
00:40:27.971 --> 00:40:28.804
<v Speaker 2>to get their voice out the class a few </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the people who are listening to your </v>

770
00:40:31.481 --> 00:40:32.314
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important to people like you to </v>

771
00:40:33.461 --> 00:40:33.761
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

772
00:40:33.761 --> 00:40:35.230
<v Speaker 2>what are you going to do about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>

773
00:40:35.650 --> 00:40:39.460
<v Speaker 2>this problem in particular?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a priority or is it like one of 12</v>

774
00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:40.270
<v Speaker 2>things on your list?</v>

775
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:41.103
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I imagine it's 11 for bernie or 12 </v>

776
00:40:42.461 --> 00:40:44.440
<v Speaker 2>somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the question isn't,</v>

777
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.470
<v Speaker 2>isn't on the list because every one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them is going to say,</v>

778
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I support reform.</v>

779
00:40:49.301 --> 00:40:51.910
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you going to bring America around so</v>

780
00:40:51.911 --> 00:40:56.080
<v Speaker 2>that America thinks on day one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what will happen.</v>

781
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 2>Whatever else happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to happen,</v>

782
00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:03.810
<v Speaker 2>and my view is if there were a democrat </v>
<v Speaker 2>running for president who said,</v>

783
00:41:03.971 --> 00:41:06.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on,</v>

784
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:07.173
<v Speaker 2>we're going to fix this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the trumpers who were draining the </v>

785
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:11.104
<v Speaker 2>swamp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the 25 percent of that base </v>

786
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:13.594
<v Speaker 2>that's drained the swamp is come with me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that guy did not drain the </v>

787
00:41:17.111 --> 00:41:18.790
<v Speaker 2>swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy filled the swamp.</v>

788
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:20.123
<v Speaker 2>Swamp monsters are bigger and more and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more vital now than now than they ever </v>

789
00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:25.300
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but come with me.</v>

790
00:41:25.301 --> 00:41:26.134
<v Speaker 2>We actually will do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a way to break this </v>

791
00:41:28.391 --> 00:41:29.224
<v Speaker 2>election so that it becomes an election </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the unity around this recognition </v>

792
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.123
<v Speaker 2>rather than the disunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the screaming laughed against </v>

793
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:38.061
<v Speaker 2>the screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

794
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:38.990
<v Speaker 2>which is the way things.</v>

795
00:41:39.570 --> 00:41:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Now we're evolving to a person on sit </v>
<v Speaker 3>down on the outside who doesn't have any</v>

796
00:41:42.931 --> 00:41:43.764
<v Speaker 3>involvement in politics like myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seemed so unbelievably complicated </v>

797
00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:50.880
<v Speaker 3>that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It exhausts you when you start examining</v>

798
00:41:50.881 --> 00:41:53.550
<v Speaker 3>it and trying to pay attention to it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the system will works.</v>

799
00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the recent past,</v>

800
00:41:57.331 --> 00:42:01.530
<v Speaker 3>there was something that was changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>that allows corporations to donate money</v>

801
00:42:01.531 --> 00:42:03.480
<v Speaker 3>the same way that an individual would.</v>

802
00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in 2010,</v>

803
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:07.583
<v Speaker 2>the United States supreme court decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>a case called citizens united and </v>

804
00:42:11.011 --> 00:42:11.844
<v Speaker 2>citizens united said that you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>limit limit a corporation's ability to </v>

805
00:42:15.871 --> 00:42:20.070
<v Speaker 2>spend money independently of a political</v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign,</v>

806
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.980
<v Speaker 2>so corporations not allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contribute directly,</v>

807
00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.383
<v Speaker 2>but that's not worth that much because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're only allowed to give a total of </v>

808
00:42:26.191 --> 00:42:27.024
<v Speaker 2>$5,400</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a candidate over the course of the </v>

809
00:42:29.131 --> 00:42:29.964
<v Speaker 2>life of his campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what citizens united said is that </v>

810
00:42:32.721 --> 00:42:33.554
<v Speaker 2>the constitution protects the right of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the corporation to engage in political </v>

811
00:42:37.051 --> 00:42:39.270
<v Speaker 2>speech independent of a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>

812
00:42:39.271 --> 00:42:40.104
<v Speaker 2>So if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if some congressmen is running for </v>

813
00:42:42.001 --> 00:42:42.834
<v Speaker 2>congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exxon corporation can come in and spend </v>

814
00:42:45.241 --> 00:42:48.450
<v Speaker 2>a million dollars to say why that </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressman is a good congressman or why</v>

815
00:42:48.451 --> 00:42:49.920
<v Speaker 2>that congressmen the terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressman,</v>

816
00:42:49.921 --> 00:42:51.660
<v Speaker 2>but they have a constitutional right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

817
00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when that happened,</v>

818
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:57.600
<v Speaker 2>there are a bunch of us who were chicken</v>
<v Speaker 2>littles about this,</v>

819
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:58.463
<v Speaker 2>who said this is the end of democracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because these corporations are just </v>

820
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:01.493
<v Speaker 2>going to spend unbelievable amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money in the political process like </v>

821
00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:07.050
<v Speaker 2>spending their money to effect the </v>
<v Speaker 2>results,</v>

822
00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:07.943
<v Speaker 2>and that was not correct because what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened is corporations quickly </v>

823
00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:16.110
<v Speaker 2>discovered the high price of free </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

824
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:16.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

825
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.640
<v Speaker 2>So corporations like target back day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

826
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.573
<v Speaker 2>anti gay candidate for governor and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden found their stores being </v>

827
00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.403
<v Speaker 2>picketed across the country because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people were furious that they would be </v>

828
00:43:31.111 --> 00:43:32.790
<v Speaker 2>supporting such a candidate for </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor.</v>

829
00:43:32.791 --> 00:43:33.624
<v Speaker 2>So corporates to quickly found that it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not cheap to engage in political speech </v>

830
00:43:36.991 --> 00:43:38.670
<v Speaker 2>in the marketplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't want to do it like that.</v>

831
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.863
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to find a way to channel </v>

832
00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:45.951
<v Speaker 2>their money into dark money </v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations or into what evolved after</v>

833
00:43:46.951 --> 00:43:49.020
<v Speaker 2>citizens united,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something called super pacs.</v>

834
00:43:49.830 --> 00:43:52.230
<v Speaker 2>Super pacs were created not by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme court.</v>

835
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.860
<v Speaker 2>Superpacs were created by a lower court </v>
<v Speaker 2>that said,</v>

836
00:43:55.861 --> 00:43:56.694
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can spend unlimited amounts of </v>

837
00:43:58.111 --> 00:43:58.944
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be allowed to give unlimited </v>

838
00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:04.050
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money to an independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>political action committee.</v>

839
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:09.230
<v Speaker 2>That was the super pac supreme court has</v>
<v Speaker 2>never ruled on that question.</v>

840
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:11.543
<v Speaker 2>We have a case that we're taking up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska that's trying to appeal to the </v>

841
00:44:15.121 --> 00:44:15.954
<v Speaker 2>supreme court to get them to actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>decide whether super pacs are mandated </v>

842
00:44:19.231 --> 00:44:20.064
<v Speaker 2>by the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's different about this case as </v>

843
00:44:22.231 --> 00:44:25.320
<v Speaker 2>the argument we're making is to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservatives.</v>

844
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:28.590
<v Speaker 2>What we're saying is the framers of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>

845
00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.513
<v Speaker 2>we're obsessed with corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the issue they were </v>

846
00:44:31.501 --> 00:44:35.700
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly trying to avoid and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't focused on bribery.</v>

847
00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.520
<v Speaker 2>They were focused on institutional </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>

848
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:39.354
<v Speaker 2>These institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became unconnected to their purpose </v>

849
00:44:41.970 --> 00:44:42.803
<v Speaker 2>representing americans and what our view</v>
<v Speaker 2>is is you know these conservatives on </v>

850
00:44:46.351 --> 00:44:47.184
<v Speaker 2>the supreme court,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like neil gorsuch or justice thomas or </v>

851
00:44:51.451 --> 00:44:52.284
<v Speaker 2>brett kavanaugh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who say that we interpret the </v>

852
00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:56.250
<v Speaker 2>constitution of the way the framers </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have interpreted it.</v>

853
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.050
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make the argument to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

854
00:44:58.051 --> 00:45:01.770
<v Speaker 2>which is there is no doubt the framers </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the constitution would have looked at</v>

855
00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:04.350
<v Speaker 2>these super pacs and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are an abomination.</v>

856
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:05.783
<v Speaker 2>These are outrageous from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of that democracy they were </v>

857
00:45:09.211 --> 00:45:10.044
<v Speaker 2>trying to create and those justices </v>
<v Speaker 2>should at least one of them be willing </v>

858
00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:15.504
<v Speaker 2>to stand up and defend the framers </v>
<v Speaker 2>values against this modern corruption </v>

859
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:21.323
<v Speaker 2>and if just one of them voted with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>four liberals who've already said they </v>

860
00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:26.034
<v Speaker 2>think super pacs are an abomination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we could have a way to end the </v>

861
00:45:29.821 --> 00:45:30.654
<v Speaker 2>superpacs in this system and that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be an enormous benefit </v>

862
00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 2>because they've become so powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the courts alone can't save us.</v>

863
00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.673
<v Speaker 2>Even If you ended superpacs tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have lester land because the </v>

864
00:45:45.751 --> 00:45:48.900
<v Speaker 2>super pacs are not what I was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about and less julian when I was talking</v>

865
00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:49.734
<v Speaker 2>about less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julian was giving two candidates </v>

866
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:51.894
<v Speaker 2>directly and the small number of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would still be giving two candidates </v>

867
00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:59.781
<v Speaker 2>directly and the only way to solve that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is for congress to pass new laws.</v>

868
00:46:00.271 --> 00:46:02.010
<v Speaker 2>That changed the way campaigns get </v>
<v Speaker 2>funded.</v>

869
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:03.443
<v Speaker 2>That's the sort of thing hr one is </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to do as a sort of thing roca </v>

870
00:46:05.851 --> 00:46:06.684
<v Speaker 2>honda's trying to do with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the sort of thing that we don't </v>

871
00:46:08.731 --> 00:46:09.564
<v Speaker 2>have a precedent to support right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have democratic presidential </v>

872
00:46:11.491 --> 00:46:12.324
<v Speaker 2>candidates who are making it the </v>
<v Speaker 2>champion issue right now and it won't </v>

873
00:46:15.301 --> 00:46:16.290
<v Speaker 2>get done unless they do,</v>

874
00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:17.243
<v Speaker 3>but it seems complicated to people when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you try to explain campaign finance and </v>

875
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:22.014
<v Speaker 3>you try to explain contributions to </v>
<v Speaker 3>candidates and contributions to sitting </v>

876
00:46:25.201 --> 00:46:27.240
<v Speaker 3>senators and congressmen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

877
00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.133
<v Speaker 3>It's complicated and there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 3>different things to think about when </v>

878
00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:33.690
<v Speaker 3>you're discussing this that to a person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's on the outside,</v>

879
00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:35.220
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you fix this?</v>

880
00:46:35.221 --> 00:46:37.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are the laws now?</v>

881
00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:38.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did they get that way?</v>

882
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

883
00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.713
<v Speaker 3>well how about make it so they can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>give them money and there's all these </v>

884
00:46:43.211 --> 00:46:45.600
<v Speaker 3>like real simplistic views of it from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outside,</v>

885
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:46.973
<v Speaker 3>but it seems that it at the very least </v>
<v Speaker 3>limiting the amount of money that </v>

886
00:46:51.631 --> 00:46:53.880
<v Speaker 3>someone's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the maximum amount of money</v>

887
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:54.860
<v Speaker 3>someone can give to a county</v>

888
00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.880
<v Speaker 2>right now in the primary and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

889
00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:00.160
<v Speaker 2>It's $5,400,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$2,700</v>

890
00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:01.473
<v Speaker 2>in each and that goes up according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflation and that's pretty small </v>

891
00:47:04.781 --> 00:47:08.020
<v Speaker 2>potatoes compared to what the super pacs</v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing,</v>

892
00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:08.943
<v Speaker 2>reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have these people running who </v>

893
00:47:10.631 --> 00:47:11.464
<v Speaker 2>expect they're going to raise the money </v>
<v Speaker 2>to run their office from their direct </v>

894
00:47:13.751 --> 00:47:14.584
<v Speaker 2>contributions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're counting on the super pacs </v>

895
00:47:16.481 --> 00:47:17.314
<v Speaker 2>to come in and spends ungodly amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money like tens of millions of dollars </v>

896
00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:23.990
<v Speaker 2>to support their candidate or to oppose </v>
<v Speaker 2>their up their opponent,</v>

897
00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:29.730
<v Speaker 2>and so the supporters for those super </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't even tiny.</v>

898
00:47:30.611 --> 00:47:34.720
<v Speaker 2>There's are the adolfs in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People named adolf this tiny,</v>

899
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:35.583
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny number of people who are </v>

900
00:47:36.401 --> 00:47:39.640
<v Speaker 2>contributing to those to those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're right,</v>

901
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:40.743
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

902
00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:41.743
<v Speaker 2>there is no reason why most americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>should understand the complexities of </v>

903
00:47:44.621 --> 00:47:46.780
<v Speaker 2>campaign finance law and they don't need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

904
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:47.703
<v Speaker 2>What they need to ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we have a system of integrity in the </v>

905
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:55.000
<v Speaker 2>way we select representatives and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

906
00:47:55.001 --> 00:47:55.834
<v Speaker 2>if you're not brain dead in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe the answer to that question </v>

907
00:47:57.851 --> 00:47:58.684
<v Speaker 2>is no.</v>

908
00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.170
<v Speaker 2>We do not have a system of integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no representational integrity.</v>

909
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.153
<v Speaker 2>It is corrupted in all the obvious raise</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like nobody should be forced to </v>

910
00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:11.320
<v Speaker 2>study campaign finance in order to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an entitlement to say,</v>

911
00:48:11.321 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 2>hell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hell no.</v>

912
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:16.780
<v Speaker 2>This system has got to end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think you're right.</v>

913
00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:18.070
<v Speaker 2>If we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

914
00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:18.943
<v Speaker 2>people are forced to like articulate all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 34 different changes that have to </v>

915
00:48:21.551 --> 00:48:22.840
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're never going to get there,</v>

916
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:23.913
<v Speaker 2>but let's not go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just start and end with it is a </v>

917
00:48:25.901 --> 00:48:30.580
<v Speaker 2>corrupted system and we want politicians</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fix it and if they don't fix it,</v>

918
00:48:30.581 --> 00:48:32.770
<v Speaker 2>we'll throw them out until we get the </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians who do.</v>

919
00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 2>And if we could build That as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

920
00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:38.740
<v Speaker 2>the recognition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the core message of 20 slash 20,</v>

921
00:48:38.741 --> 00:48:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a real shot because </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've primed the republican party.</v>

922
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.983
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of people in that party </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are now so disgusted with the </v>

923
00:48:46.541 --> 00:48:47.860
<v Speaker 2>corruption of the system.</v>

924
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.320
<v Speaker 2>Not necessarily mitch mcconnell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he loves it,</v>

925
00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.333
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ordinary republican voters and the </v>

926
00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:57.670
<v Speaker 2>democrats have now committed themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fixing this corrupted system.</v>

927
00:48:58.070 --> 00:48:58.903
<v Speaker 2>This is the moment to do that and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have to get into the details of </v>

928
00:49:01.481 --> 00:49:02.314
<v Speaker 2>how much you should be allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contribute to say there is a way to fix </v>

929
00:49:04.901 --> 00:49:07.000
<v Speaker 2>this that would give us a representative</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy,</v>

930
00:49:07.001 --> 00:49:09.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe not again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the first time wise,</v>

931
00:49:09.761 --> 00:49:12.100
<v Speaker 2>mitch mcconnell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so uniquely evil.</v>

932
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:13.503
<v Speaker 2>This guy has had it in his dna from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first moment he went to Washington to </v>

933
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:26.670
<v Speaker 2>end any regulation of money in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He engineered the selection of the fec,</v>

934
00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:31.203
<v Speaker 2>the federal election commission </v>
<v Speaker 2>commissioners so that they would block </v>

935
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.570
<v Speaker 2>basically every enforcement action with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ftc.</v>

936
00:49:37.571 --> 00:49:41.650
<v Speaker 2>The fcc does nothing now because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commission that has half republicans and</v>

937
00:49:41.651 --> 00:49:42.484
<v Speaker 2>half democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if the republicans disagree from the </v>

938
00:49:44.771 --> 00:49:46.600
<v Speaker 2>democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then nothing gets done.</v>

939
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:48.063
<v Speaker 2>They can't enforce the most simple rules</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore because mitch mcconnell is </v>

940
00:49:50.891 --> 00:49:54.340
<v Speaker 2>populated the fec with people who don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in campaign finance rules.</v>

941
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:55.503
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>citizens united this decision that said </v>

942
00:49:56.921 --> 00:49:57.754
<v Speaker 2>corporations could give unlimited </v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of money to independent </v>

943
00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:02.980
<v Speaker 2>political speaking says one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest decisions of the supreme court.</v>

944
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:06.100
<v Speaker 2>And he said he was gonna fight like hell</v>
<v Speaker 2>to defend it.</v>

945
00:50:06.101 --> 00:50:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And when this proposed hr one was raised</v>
<v Speaker 2>to him,</v>

946
00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:11.013
<v Speaker 2>mitch mcconnell said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not a chance in hell this will </v>

947
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.233
<v Speaker 2>ever even get a debate in the senate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This man is obsessed with the idea that </v>

948
00:50:18.491 --> 00:50:23.491
<v Speaker 2>money should have the power in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington that it has right now.</v>

949
00:50:23.801 --> 00:50:26.290
<v Speaker 2>And people are talking about reforming </v>
<v Speaker 2>it are the enemy.</v>

950
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:27.183
<v Speaker 2>And so you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about mitch mcconnell is he's </v>

951
00:50:29.481 --> 00:50:30.314
<v Speaker 2>actually an incredibly smart man and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an incredibly smart strategist and </v>

952
00:50:34.251 --> 00:50:36.320
<v Speaker 2>he's been playing this game for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

953
00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:37.683
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

954
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:38.703
<v Speaker 2>and I think he's like responsible for 85</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of the judicial structure that </v>

955
00:50:41.991 --> 00:50:43.820
<v Speaker 2>makes it possible for this to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>blocked.</v>

956
00:50:43.821 --> 00:50:44.654
<v Speaker 2>There's an amazing series to debates </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened 20 years ago between john </v>

957
00:50:47.871 --> 00:50:48.704
<v Speaker 2>mccain and mitch mcconnell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was when congress was passing </v>

958
00:50:51.711 --> 00:50:53.420
<v Speaker 2>something called the mccain feingold </v>
<v Speaker 2>law,</v>

959
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:55.910
<v Speaker 2>which was the last great effort to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this problem.</v>

960
00:50:55.911 --> 00:50:58.910
<v Speaker 2>And it was flawed and a bunch of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was an important success.</v>

961
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Mitch mcconnell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm stood on the floor of the senate and</v>

962
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:06.140
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mr mccain says that,</v>

963
00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the senate,</v>

964
00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:07.934
<v Speaker 2>we can't say mr again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the senator from Arizona has said </v>

965
00:51:10.251 --> 00:51:13.370
<v Speaker 2>that the system is corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want him to name the corrupt people,</v>

966
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:15.193
<v Speaker 2>and mccain stands up and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking about particular </v>

967
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:18.530
<v Speaker 2>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about the system.</v>

968
00:51:18.531 --> 00:51:21.350
<v Speaker 2>It's the system's corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then mcconnell,</v>

969
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:22.840
<v Speaker 2>almost clueless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

970
00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:25.730
<v Speaker 2>if the system's corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there must be corrupt people.</v>

971
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.980
<v Speaker 2>If there's not corrupt people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the system's not corrupt.</v>

972
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.280
<v Speaker 2>So the only corruption he could imagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>was corruption where somebody was taking</v>

973
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:34.154
<v Speaker 2>a bribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if that's the only corruption we're </v>

974
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:36.524
<v Speaker 2>allowed to remedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the whole system of influence we </v>

975
00:51:40.851 --> 00:51:45.050
<v Speaker 2>have right now is not to be touched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

976
00:51:45.051 --> 00:51:45.884
<v Speaker 2>I think mccain's point was you can have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a system filled with lots of honor's </v>

977
00:51:48.841 --> 00:51:52.580
<v Speaker 2>congress people and lots of honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>senators who never engage in bribery,</v>

978
00:51:53.540 --> 00:51:54.373
<v Speaker 2>but they know how to bob and weave and </v>
<v Speaker 2>bend and speak and say the right things </v>

979
00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 2>to attract the right kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's as much corruption as bribery</v>

980
00:52:03.381 --> 00:52:06.140
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And mccain's view was we had to end it.</v>

981
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:07.543
<v Speaker 2>So he was the last great republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter for reform of this corrupted </v>

982
00:52:12.411 --> 00:52:13.790
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'd been many,</v>

983
00:52:13.791 --> 00:52:14.624
<v Speaker 2>before barry goldwater was an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>vocal opponent to the role of money in </v>

984
00:52:18.681 --> 00:52:19.514
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think what we have to do is to </v>

985
00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:26.460
<v Speaker 2>find a way to revive that and to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leverage from this president's assertion</v>

986
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.733
<v Speaker 2>that this is a corrupt system and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to change the system into actually </v>

987
00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:34.220
<v Speaker 2>building the political power to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>that change happen.</v>

988
00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:38.010
<v Speaker 3>Another thing that's very weird is it </v>
<v Speaker 3>every four years or so,</v>

989
00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.950
<v Speaker 3>there's this cry to eliminate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>electoral college.</v>

990
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:42.333
<v Speaker 3>Every four years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people realized that the battleground </v>

991
00:52:44.730 --> 00:52:45.563
<v Speaker 3>states are so critical and that so much </v>
<v Speaker 3>money is being spent on the small </v>

992
00:52:49.591 --> 00:52:50.424
<v Speaker 3>handful of states because they give you </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the electoral votes and this is how </v>

993
00:52:53.551 --> 00:52:55.370
<v Speaker 3>you win an election,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then people say,</v>

994
00:52:55.371 --> 00:52:56.131
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is that?</v>

995
00:52:56.131 --> 00:52:58.200
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should be one person,</v>

996
00:52:58.201 --> 00:52:59.034
<v Speaker 3>one vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are we really that divided as a nation </v>

997
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.823
<v Speaker 3>that we need to isolate ourselves into </v>
<v Speaker 3>these small little lines in the dirt </v>

998
00:53:05.191 --> 00:53:08.820
<v Speaker 3>where this part is worth this amount and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that parts worth that amount.</v>

999
00:53:08.821 --> 00:53:09.654
<v Speaker 3>And so everybody plays this weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>electoral college game and then you get </v>

1000
00:53:13.891 --> 00:53:14.724
<v Speaker 3>a situation like what just happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>where hillary clinton wins the popular </v>

1001
00:53:17.881 --> 00:53:18.714
<v Speaker 3>vote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not the president because the </v>

1002
00:53:19.411 --> 00:53:21.720
<v Speaker 3>electoral college is what makes </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

1003
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way you just described this </v>

1004
00:53:23.731 --> 00:53:26.370
<v Speaker 2>problem is exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people have to think about it.</v>

1005
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:27.550
<v Speaker 2>The problem isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1006
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:30.900
<v Speaker 2>it is a bad thing that the loser wins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1007
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 2>That's just not the way elections </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to work.</v>

1008
00:53:33.691 --> 00:53:36.090
<v Speaker 2>So that's happened twice in our </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime.</v>

1009
00:53:36.750 --> 00:53:37.770
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1010
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.950
<v Speaker 2>it happened 100 years before that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's going to happen more frequently</v>

1011
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:43.020
<v Speaker 2>going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can show that demographically,</v>

1012
00:53:43.021 --> 00:53:43.854
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is that in every </v>

1013
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.113
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the presidential candidates are focused </v>

1014
00:53:51.181 --> 00:53:53.460
<v Speaker 2>on just 14 states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The battleground states,</v>

1015
00:53:53.461 --> 00:53:58.461
<v Speaker 2>the purple states and those 14 states </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the only states that matter to those</v>

1016
00:53:59.071 --> 00:53:59.904
<v Speaker 2>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what scholars have demonstrated as </v>

1017
00:54:02.161 --> 00:54:02.994
<v Speaker 2>the presidents and campaigns bend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves and their policies to make </v>

1018
00:54:06.691 --> 00:54:07.524
<v Speaker 2>those states happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those states don't represent </v>

1019
00:54:10.201 --> 00:54:11.430
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're older,</v>

1020
00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.160
<v Speaker 2>they're wider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're industry is kind of 19th century</v>

1021
00:54:14.161 --> 00:54:14.994
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

1022
00:54:15.090 --> 00:54:15.923
<v Speaker 2>There are seven and a half times the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of people in America working in </v>

1023
00:54:18.451 --> 00:54:23.340
<v Speaker 2>solar energy as mine coal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you never hear about solar energy In</v>

1024
00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 2>a presidential campaign because those </v>
<v Speaker 2>people live in California and Texas.</v>

1025
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:28.920
<v Speaker 2>They don't matter to the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 2>election,</v>

1026
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:31.740
<v Speaker 2>which you hear about his coal mining </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the 50,000</v>

1027
00:54:31.741 --> 00:54:35.310
<v Speaker 2>coal miners left in America happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live in these battleground states.</v>

1028
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:36.443
<v Speaker 2>So this is just a product of the way the</v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral college or the way states </v>

1029
00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.760
<v Speaker 2>count their votes to allocate their </v>
<v Speaker 2>electors.</v>

1030
00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Something called the winner take all </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1031
00:54:47.070 --> 00:54:47.903
<v Speaker 2>So all but two states say that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>winner of the popular vote gets all of </v>

1032
00:54:52.471 --> 00:54:54.940
<v Speaker 2>the electoral votes for that state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>

1033
00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:55.923
<v Speaker 2>in 2000 in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Bush won that state based on a </v>

1034
00:54:59.581 --> 00:55:00.414
<v Speaker 2>stop to recount by 531 votes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goT all the electoral college votes </v>

1035
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:08.220
<v Speaker 2>in that state even though he just barely</v>
<v Speaker 2>won that state.</v>

1036
00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:09.533
<v Speaker 2>And so winner take all is what makes it </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that it doesn't make sense for </v>

1037
00:55:12.931 --> 00:55:13.764
<v Speaker 2>anybody to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pay any attention to any of the non </v>

1038
00:55:16.381 --> 00:55:17.214
<v Speaker 2>battleground states and penn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of your tiMe in the battleground </v>

1039
00:55:19.441 --> 00:55:20.274
<v Speaker 2>states in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>99 percent of campaign spending was in </v>

1040
00:55:23.911 --> 00:55:25.650
<v Speaker 2>14 states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90,</v>

1041
00:55:25.680 --> 00:55:28.950
<v Speaker 2>99 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>95 percent of time,</v>

1042
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:30.263
<v Speaker 2>But the only reason they were not 99 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent in those battleground states as </v>

1043
00:55:33.241 --> 00:55:34.074
<v Speaker 2>the other five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were in New York and California </v>

1044
00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:36.390
<v Speaker 2>raising money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>RighT?</v>

1045
00:55:36.391 --> 00:55:37.224
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this is a system designed to give </v>

1046
00:55:40.351 --> 00:55:42.150
<v Speaker 2>power to these battleground states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>

1047
00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:42.984
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is it something the constitution </v>

1048
00:55:45.271 --> 00:55:46.104
<v Speaker 2>requires?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is absolutely </v>

1049
00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.044
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The constitution does not say how the </v>

1050
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:51.414
<v Speaker 2>states will allocate their electors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and indeed when states started adopting </v>

1051
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:56.963
<v Speaker 2>this winner take all system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many thought it was an outrageous </v>

1052
00:56:00.661 --> 00:56:03.570
<v Speaker 2>perversion of the constitutional design.</v>

1053
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:07.770
<v Speaker 2>So jeff to jefferson was outraged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he said,</v>

1054
00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:09.240
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some states are going to do it.</v>

1055
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:13.380
<v Speaker 2>Then all states have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're a state that allocates</v>

1056
00:56:13.381 --> 00:56:14.214
<v Speaker 2>all of your electrodes to the winner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have more power than </v>

1057
00:56:16.531 --> 00:56:18.840
<v Speaker 2>your neighboring states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You only gets half the electrodes to the</v>

1058
00:56:18.841 --> 00:56:19.674
<v Speaker 2>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So very quickly there was a race to the </v>

1059
00:56:20.911 --> 00:56:22.740
<v Speaker 2>bottom and that's kind of where it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck.</v>

1060
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:25.270
<v Speaker 2>And so the question is now what we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do about it.</v>

1061
00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:26.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two big reform efforts out </v>

1062
00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:29.044
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is called the national </v>

1063
00:56:30.851 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 2>popular vote compact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I should say,</v>

1064
00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:35.404
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine amending the </v>

1065
00:56:35.831 --> 00:56:38.440
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it takes three fourths of the states</v>

1066
00:56:38.441 --> 00:56:39.274
<v Speaker 2>to change the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And three fourths of the states are not </v>

1067
00:56:41.711 --> 00:56:44.050
<v Speaker 2>going to agree with abolishing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral college.</v>

1068
00:56:44.051 --> 00:56:46.810
<v Speaker 2>So this is not going to happen anytime </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon through the constitution.</v>

1069
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.290
<v Speaker 2>But there are two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without amending the constitution,</v>

1070
00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:52.920
<v Speaker 2>we could fix this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Won the national popular vote pro.</v>

1071
00:56:52.990 --> 00:56:55.330
<v Speaker 2>A compact is basically states who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1072
00:56:55.331 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 2>we're going to pledge our electors to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the winner of the national popular vote.</v>

1073
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:04.690
<v Speaker 2>So the state looks at who won the </v>
<v Speaker 2>national popular vote,</v>

1074
00:57:04.691 --> 00:57:05.524
<v Speaker 2>and then picks the slate of electors </v>
<v Speaker 2>from their state with a party of the </v>

1075
00:57:09.161 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 2>person who won the national popular </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote.</v>

1076
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:12.243
<v Speaker 2>So in a state like New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the republican won the national </v>

1077
00:57:15.341 --> 00:57:16.174
<v Speaker 2>popular vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though most people in New York are </v>

1078
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:18.154
<v Speaker 2>democratic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would allocate their electrodes to </v>

1079
00:57:19.661 --> 00:57:22.210
<v Speaker 2>the republican vice versa in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1080
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 2>that's the way that system would work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1081
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:28.840
<v Speaker 2>I personally liked the system because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the idea of one person,</v>

1082
00:57:28.841 --> 00:57:29.674
<v Speaker 2>one vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's vote is an american citizen </v>

1083
00:57:30.881 --> 00:57:32.530
<v Speaker 2>for the american president should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>equal.</v>

1084
00:57:32.531 --> 00:57:33.364
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't matter that you're having to </v>

1085
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:36.940
<v Speaker 2>live in Wyoming versus Pennsylvania </v>
<v Speaker 2>versus New York.</v>

1086
00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:38.573
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are people who are worried </v>

1087
00:57:39.221 --> 00:57:42.910
<v Speaker 2>about this because they fear that it'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>become a kind of flyover democracy.</v>

1088
00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:47.940
<v Speaker 2>But the only places that candidates will</v>
<v Speaker 2>care about will be places like la or New</v>

1089
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:52.300
<v Speaker 2>York or chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually don't think that's right,</v>

1090
00:57:52.301 --> 00:57:53.134
<v Speaker 2>but I get the understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're wrong about the way the </v>

1091
00:57:54.941 --> 00:57:55.774
<v Speaker 2>campaigns work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I understand why they're anxious </v>

1092
00:57:56.681 --> 00:57:57.514
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then that leads to the alternative </v>

1093
00:57:58.991 --> 00:58:00.280
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something,</v>

1094
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my group equal citizens.us</v>

1095
00:58:02.861 --> 00:58:05.610
<v Speaker 2>is litigating this right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1096
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:08.830
<v Speaker 2>we're just trying to declare this winner</v>
<v Speaker 2>take all system,</v>

1097
00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:13.390
<v Speaker 2>violates the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it basically says that if you're</v>

1098
00:58:13.391 --> 00:58:16.810
<v Speaker 2>a republican in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your vote never matters.</v>

1099
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.793
<v Speaker 2>If you're a democrat in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your vote never matters because we just </v>

1100
00:58:20.021 --> 00:58:20.854
<v Speaker 2>count your vote up and then we throw it </v>
<v Speaker 2>away because we allocate all the </v>

1101
00:58:23.861 --> 00:58:27.040
<v Speaker 2>electors to the dominant party in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

1102
00:58:27.610 --> 00:58:30.390
<v Speaker 2>And so we've got david boies is our </v>
<v Speaker 2>chief litigate,</v>

1103
00:58:30.391 --> 00:58:33.610
<v Speaker 2>or we've got a case in California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

1104
00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:34.803
<v Speaker 2>South Carolina and Massachusetts asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>the courts to declare a winner take all </v>

1105
00:58:38.981 --> 00:58:39.814
<v Speaker 2>unconstitutional and instead say that </v>
<v Speaker 2>electrons have to be allocated </v>

1106
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:43.833
<v Speaker 2>proportionally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you get 40 percent of the vote in </v>

1107
00:58:45.581 --> 00:58:47.180
<v Speaker 2>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get 40 percent of the electorate.</v>

1108
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.480
<v Speaker 2>If you get 50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get 50 percent of doctors.</v>

1109
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:50.853
<v Speaker 2>And what that would do overnight is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would make every state in the nation </v>

1110
00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:56.913
<v Speaker 2>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there'd be a reason for a democrat </v>

1111
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.890
<v Speaker 2>to go to Texas because you're not going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get all the electoral votes.</v>

1112
00:59:02.891 --> 00:59:04.570
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to get a half the </v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral votes,</v>

1113
00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.330
<v Speaker 2>but you'll get 40 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 45 percent.</v>

1114
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:08.830
<v Speaker 2>And that could matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1115
00:59:08.831 --> 00:59:11.590
<v Speaker 2>or a republican would go to California </v>
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1116
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:13.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get all the votes in</v>

1117
00:59:13.241 --> 00:59:14.860
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to get a lot.</v>

1118
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.420
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of republicans in </v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

1119
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:17.643
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so this change would immediately make </v>

1120
00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:20.344
<v Speaker 2>every state in play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But unlike the national popular vote </v>

1121
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:24.613
<v Speaker 2>alternatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many people who look at this </v>

1122
00:59:26.031 --> 00:59:28.550
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this will be better because small states</v>

1123
00:59:28.551 --> 00:59:31.430
<v Speaker 2>would still have a pretty important role</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an elector as an elector.</v>

1124
00:59:31.431 --> 00:59:34.130
<v Speaker 2>And if I can get it from Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to care about Arizona if I can</v>

1125
00:59:34.131 --> 00:59:35.960
<v Speaker 2>get it from Arkansas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>care about Arkansas.</v>

1126
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.333
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not going to just be the big </v>

1127
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:41.540
<v Speaker 2>states are the big population centers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be every state.</v>

1128
00:59:42.050 --> 00:59:43.900
<v Speaker 2>And so if we can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1129
00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:44.773
<v Speaker 2>a court to say this violates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution and then you could have </v>

1130
00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:52.790
<v Speaker 2>states forest to allocate their electors</v>
<v Speaker 2>proportionally.</v>

1131
00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:53.653
<v Speaker 2>And if they did that and then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem that you identified at the </v>

1132
00:59:56.871 --> 00:59:57.704
<v Speaker 2>start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is the problem could be </v>

1133
00:59:59.541 --> 01:00:00.374
<v Speaker 2>solved overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would no longer have these </v>

1134
01:00:01.371 --> 01:00:04.190
<v Speaker 2>battleground states deciding everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd ever president.</v>

1135
01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:05.024
<v Speaker 2>Who cares about getting elected by all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of America and that would be incredible </v>

1136
01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:12.920
<v Speaker 2>improvement though that seems like in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and of itself would be a game changer</v>

1137
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.140
<v Speaker 2>if they could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would change a lot.</v>

1138
01:00:15.141 --> 01:00:17.090
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1139
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:22.160
<v Speaker 2>you said you don't think that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible that we would ever vote out the</v>

1140
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 2>electoral college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is there a support for the electoral</v>

1141
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:27.650
<v Speaker 2>college?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a good argument for it?</v>

1142
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.823
<v Speaker 2>So there is support for the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everY state have a role and there's a </v>

1143
01:00:36.921 --> 01:00:40.220
<v Speaker 2>support for the idea that small states </v>
<v Speaker 2>get to kind of thumb on the scale,</v>

1144
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.440
<v Speaker 2>which is what the electoral college </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

1145
01:00:42.441 --> 01:00:44.840
<v Speaker 2>So there is some supportive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most people,</v>

1146
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:48.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of people don't like the idea</v>

1147
01:00:48.261 --> 01:00:52.160
<v Speaker 2>that the president is not chosen from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of voters.</v>

1148
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.863
<v Speaker 2>So most people would oppose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is to change the </v>

1149
01:00:55.551 --> 01:01:00.551
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need the state legislatures or state</v>

1150
01:01:00.621 --> 01:01:05.240
<v Speaker 2>conventions to agree with the change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what many states,</v>

1151
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.640
<v Speaker 2>at least thIrteen states I fear would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1152
01:01:07.641 --> 01:01:10.430
<v Speaker 2>is that we actually win more under this </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1153
01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Then we lose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're not going to change the system,</v>

1154
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:14.543
<v Speaker 2>and so unless you get like some </v>
<v Speaker 2>overwhelmingly popular movement to </v>

1155
01:01:18.171 --> 01:01:19.310
<v Speaker 2>support it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or again,</v>

1156
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can imagine a presidential candidate</v>

1157
01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:25.160
<v Speaker 2>who kind of made fixing this part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy part of the plan too.</v>

1158
01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:26.653
<v Speaker 2>I don't see how you're going to build a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political movement to get there or </v>

1159
01:01:28.411 --> 01:01:30.620
<v Speaker 2>another way of putting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

1160
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:35.120
<v Speaker 2>this national popular vote compact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is going around state to state and</v>

1161
01:01:35.121 --> 01:01:37.760
<v Speaker 2>getting states to join right now has </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a hundred.</v>

1162
01:01:37.810 --> 01:01:38.643
<v Speaker 2>And so the way this works is that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>the equivalent of 270 electoral votes </v>

1163
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.310
<v Speaker 2>have been committed than the compact </v>
<v Speaker 2>kicks in.</v>

1164
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.720
<v Speaker 2>So when they get to 270,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem goes away.</v>

1165
01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:52.940
<v Speaker 2>You know the problem of this electoral </v>
<v Speaker 2>college goes away because add to 70,</v>

1166
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.863
<v Speaker 2>according to the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the winner of the popular vote wins the </v>

1167
01:01:55.941 --> 01:01:56.774
<v Speaker 2>electoral college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They right now have 172 electors </v>

1168
01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:01.550
<v Speaker 2>pledged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1169
01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.384
<v Speaker 2>So they have less than 100 more to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is they've got to </v>

1170
01:02:05.391 --> 01:02:10.391
<v Speaker 2>convince states to join the compact and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of.</v>

1171
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:14.120
<v Speaker 2>They kind of hit this red wall now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because many republicans thing,</v>

1172
01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>the only way to win the presidency is </v>
<v Speaker 2>through the electoral college.</v>

1173
01:02:16.911 --> 01:02:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many state legislatures,</v>

1174
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.003
<v Speaker 2>why do they believe that?</v>

1175
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:21.923
<v Speaker 1>I think many republicans just think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're great benefit is from the </v>

1176
01:02:24.961 --> 01:02:25.794
<v Speaker 1>electoral college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising because the </v>

1177
01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:27.774
<v Speaker 1>battleground states are primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>republican because the base number of </v>

1178
01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>republican states is sell high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1179
01:02:32.401 --> 01:02:33.234
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these small rural states get </v>

1180
01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:38.760
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately more electors than </v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

1181
01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:39.594
<v Speaker 1>Like California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming gets three electors </v>

1182
01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

1183
01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they liked the system as it is.</v>

1184
01:02:45.571 --> 01:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look back and you say,</v>

1185
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:48.143
<v Speaker 1>well they got George Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he didn't win the national </v>

1186
01:02:50.221 --> 01:02:51.054
<v Speaker 1>vote and they got Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he didn't win the national </v>

1187
01:02:52.891 --> 01:02:53.724
<v Speaker 1>vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not hard for me to understand why </v>

1188
01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:56.400
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1189
01:02:56.401 --> 01:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're right about this.</v>

1190
01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:00.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2004,</v>

1191
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:02.603
<v Speaker 1>if 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>votes had switched to john kerry in </v>

1192
01:03:05.221 --> 01:03:06.054
<v Speaker 1>Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then john kerry would have won the </v>

1193
01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:13.851
<v Speaker 1>electoral college but lost the popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote and if that had happened in 2004,</v>

1194
01:03:14.191 --> 01:03:15.024
<v Speaker 1>I think the electoral college would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dead today because a republican won in </v>

1195
01:03:18.571 --> 01:03:21.390
<v Speaker 1>2000 a democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ron in 2004 people would say,</v>

1196
01:03:21.391 --> 01:03:22.710
<v Speaker 1>this system is just crazy.</v>

1197
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 1>We got to get rid of this system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now people think,</v>

1198
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:27.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>republicans benefit from this,</v>

1199
01:03:27.511 --> 01:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>so I'm a republican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to block the change.</v>

1200
01:03:29.731 --> 01:03:30.564
<v Speaker 1>And if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's never going to happen at a </v>

1201
01:03:31.951 --> 01:03:32.784
<v Speaker 1>constitutional level because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution requires three fourths of </v>

1202
01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:39.210
<v Speaker 1>the states to support the reform and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcement of the as the Donald Trump</v>

1203
01:03:39.211 --> 01:03:41.000
<v Speaker 1>one without having the popular one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1204
01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1205
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:43.583
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no hypocrisy that touches this </v>

1206
01:03:46.231 --> 01:03:47.670
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But remember,</v>

1207
01:03:47.671 --> 01:03:48.504
<v Speaker 1>in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there was a moment for about 10 </v>

1208
01:03:52.171 --> 01:03:55.170
<v Speaker 1>minutes when the national media was </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting that,</v>

1209
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:58.650
<v Speaker 1>that romney was going to win the popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote,</v>

1210
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but barack obama was going to be elected</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the electoral college.</v>

1211
01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Trump started tweeting vigorously about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how this is a denial of democracy.</v>

1212
01:04:06.151 --> 01:04:10.380
<v Speaker 1>We have to march on Washington to end </v>
<v Speaker 1>this banana republic like system because</v>

1213
01:04:10.381 --> 01:04:12.510
<v Speaker 1>the electoral college was the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible thing in the world.</v>

1214
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:13.673
<v Speaker 1>And of course after 2016 he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>different views about the electoral </v>

1215
01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:16.880
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1216
01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't old enough to understand what </v>
<v Speaker 1>was going on during watergate.</v>

1217
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Year was that?</v>

1218
01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70.</v>

1219
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.353
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1220
01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:26.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the break In happens in the lead up to </v>

1221
01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:28.614
<v Speaker 1>the 72 election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he eventually resigned after </v>

1222
01:04:30.871 --> 01:04:31.704
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is our watergate this moment </v>

1223
01:04:33.511 --> 01:04:34.344
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cohen's going to go to jail for </v>

1224
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

1225
01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:38.443
<v Speaker 1>he's testifying against trump and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are testifying and they're </v>

1226
01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>calling him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they call him?</v>

1227
01:04:43.081 --> 01:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>Coconspirator number one is that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual official individually.</v>

1228
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:52.431
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very unusual moment for us to,</v>

1229
01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.960
<v Speaker 1>to be watching this all unfold and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see this slow dissection,</v>

1230
01:04:58.321 --> 01:05:03.321
<v Speaker 1>what mueller seems to be doing is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly closing off all the escape routes</v>

1231
01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:08.130
<v Speaker 1>and slowly circling the troops around </v>
<v Speaker 1>this one area that he's trying to,</v>

1232
01:05:08.220 --> 01:05:09.840
<v Speaker 1>that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's attacking.</v>

1233
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1234
01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:14.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a brillianT tactician.</v>

1235
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1236
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1237
01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>and so I think it's that</v>

1238
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.990
<v Speaker 2>the worst for Donald Trump has yet to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come.</v>

1239
01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:21.923
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I do think the parallel is </v>

1240
01:05:23.351 --> 01:05:24.184
<v Speaker 2>watergate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a really important </v>

1241
01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:25.960
<v Speaker 2>difference here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1242
01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm old enough to remember watergate.</v>

1243
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.583
<v Speaker 2>I was like 12 or 13 minutes happened and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my uncle happened to be the lawyer who </v>

1244
01:05:33.461 --> 01:05:34.294
<v Speaker 2>worked in the house of representatives </v>
<v Speaker 2>convincing the house of representatives </v>

1245
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:37.924
<v Speaker 2>to vote the articles of impeachment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he and that weekend when nixon </v>

1246
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:42.850
<v Speaker 2>resigned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came to visit us.</v>

1247
01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:45.340
<v Speaker 2>We lived in the Kentucky part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>

1248
01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:47.860
<v Speaker 2>that kind of right wing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle part of the state.</v>

1249
01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.890
<v Speaker 2>He came to visit us and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1250
01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.960
<v Speaker 2>he told me this was gonna happen and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the event.</v>

1251
01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 2>That was the weekend that I decided I </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to become a lawyer.</v>

1252
01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:56.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

1253
01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:58.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the big difference between these two</v>

1254
01:05:58.811 --> 01:05:59.644
<v Speaker 2>times is that when that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way most people got access to news </v>

1255
01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:06.453
<v Speaker 2>was three television networks every day </v>
<v Speaker 2>they watched the news at the same time </v>

1256
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 2>because there was nothing else on.</v>

1257
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:14.373
<v Speaker 2>And those three television networks kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of shot right down the middle and told </v>

1258
01:06:17.051 --> 01:06:18.620
<v Speaker 2>the story as they saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1259
01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:19.653
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of the walter cronkite era </v>

1260
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:24.760
<v Speaker 2>of news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as this story broke,</v>

1261
01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.240
<v Speaker 2>they just reported it as they saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as they saw it,</v>

1262
01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:32.050
<v Speaker 2>it was a pretty damning indictment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the precedent.</v>

1263
01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.573
<v Speaker 2>And what's amazing is he walked the </v>
<v Speaker 2>polling among republicans and their </v>

1264
01:06:36.761 --> 01:06:40.900
<v Speaker 2>support for the president six months </v>
<v Speaker 2>before the president resigns.</v>

1265
01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:42.880
<v Speaker 2>The poll says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among republicans,</v>

1266
01:06:42.881 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 2>he has about an 83 percent support rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when he resigns,</v>

1267
01:06:46.841 --> 01:06:49.540
<v Speaker 2>his support rate among republicans is </v>
<v Speaker 2>about 50 percent.</v>

1268
01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:50.523
<v Speaker 2>And that's because the news,</v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers and television had like told </v>

1269
01:06:54.371 --> 01:06:57.220
<v Speaker 2>everybody the same story and americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing the same story.</v>

1270
01:06:57.221 --> 01:06:58.054
<v Speaker 2>It came to the same view that there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something deeply corrupted by this </v>

1271
01:07:00.191 --> 01:07:01.024
<v Speaker 2>president and he had to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't live in that news environment </v>

1272
01:07:03.611 --> 01:07:04.444
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

1273
01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:05.943
<v Speaker 2>We live in an environment where half of </v>
<v Speaker 2>America lives in one news world and the </v>

1274
01:07:09.701 --> 01:07:10.534
<v Speaker 2>other half of America lives in another </v>
<v Speaker 2>news world and the half of America </v>

1275
01:07:12.581 --> 01:07:13.414
<v Speaker 2>living in the breitbart fox news world </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not being told the stories that the </v>

1276
01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:20.260
<v Speaker 2>people living in the msnbc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>npr,</v>

1277
01:07:20.290 --> 01:07:24.340
<v Speaker 2>news universe are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in this world,</v>

1278
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.700
<v Speaker 2>the opportunity for americans to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the facts,</v>

1279
01:07:27.701 --> 01:07:28.534
<v Speaker 2>the same facts and have a reflective </v>
<v Speaker 2>judgment about it and come to a view </v>

1280
01:07:31.121 --> 01:07:36.121
<v Speaker 2>that this president on a needs to resign</v>
<v Speaker 2>or be impeached.</v>

1281
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he should be impeached,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's,</v>

1282
01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.300
<v Speaker 2>that's a separate question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1283
01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.740
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not possible.</v>

1284
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:43.570
<v Speaker 2>and that's what's so terrifying about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1285
01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.600
<v Speaker 2>When you live in a democracy where we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't all live in the same universe,</v>

1286
01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:51.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know the same facts.</v>

1287
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:52.563
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you knit together a public that </v>

1288
01:07:54.581 --> 01:07:58.150
<v Speaker 2>can address these critical issues of </v>
<v Speaker 2>national import?</v>

1289
01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:58.801
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

1290
01:07:58.801 --> 01:08:00.700
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think our biggest challenge,</v>

1291
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:01.031
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1292
01:08:01.031 --> 01:08:02.410
<v Speaker 2>it gets grayer than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1293
01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.244
<v Speaker 2>With characters like sean hannity that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they separate the line between not just </v>

1294
01:08:08.290 --> 01:08:09.123
<v Speaker 2>being some sort of a political pundit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually campaigning for the </v>

1295
01:08:12.731 --> 01:08:14.920
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing up at speeches,</v>

1296
01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:16.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing</v>

1297
01:08:16.730 --> 01:08:17.563
<v Speaker 1>the crowd making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making these big statements in support </v>

1298
01:08:20.151 --> 01:08:20.984
<v Speaker 1>of the president is very strange to </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch because I don't remember that at </v>

1299
01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:25.160
<v Speaker 1>any point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1300
01:08:25.190 --> 01:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think the thing we need to realize</v>

1301
01:08:28.701 --> 01:08:29.534
<v Speaker 1>is it is the future because it pays </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable news pays tremendously when these </v>

1302
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>people become partisan hacks inside of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics of hate,</v>

1303
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:41.383
<v Speaker 1>which is the current politics of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>both the democratic and republican </v>

1304
01:08:44.001 --> 01:08:44.834
<v Speaker 1>parties and the cable news stations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They build tribes who are deeply loyal </v>

1305
01:08:49.131 --> 01:08:49.964
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the loyalty to those tribes </v>

1306
01:08:51.651 --> 01:08:55.730
<v Speaker 1>translates into advertising dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the business model of cable.</v>

1307
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:59.540
<v Speaker 1>So sean hannity looks to old geezers </v>
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>

1308
01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.560
<v Speaker 1>like an abomination from the perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what news should be like.</v>

1309
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:06.080
<v Speaker 1>But from the standpoint of what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future is going to be,</v>

1310
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>he is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then it becomes a question like,</v>

1311
01:09:09.261 --> 01:09:13.340
<v Speaker 1>how do we knit together a democracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>given there will be people like the sean</v>

1312
01:09:13.341 --> 01:09:15.020
<v Speaker 1>hannity's on cable television.</v>

1313
01:09:15.450 --> 01:09:16.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1314
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.490
<v Speaker 1>I've began to talk about the slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy movement,</v>

1315
01:09:19.491 --> 01:09:20.300
<v Speaker 1>which I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1316
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I think I pointed to you as part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1317
01:09:22.251 --> 01:09:23.084
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's a need to begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how do we build political </v>

1318
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:26.834
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not through broadcast television but </v>

1319
01:09:29.931 --> 01:09:30.764
<v Speaker 1>through something else that gives people</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chance to think in more than 32nd </v>

1320
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:35.720
<v Speaker 1>bites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1321
01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:37.730
<v Speaker 1>and podcasting I think is a core part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1322
01:09:37.820 --> 01:09:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Is it entirely possiBle that something </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be profitable that does shoot down</v>

1323
01:09:42.381 --> 01:09:45.440
<v Speaker 1>the middle because people are so tired </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this cnn,</v>

1324
01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:48.890
<v Speaker 1>fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar distribution of information.</v>

1325
01:09:48.891 --> 01:09:50.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when the elections were going</v>

1326
01:09:50.721 --> 01:09:51.554
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would flip back and forth between the </v>

1327
01:09:53.481 --> 01:09:56.530
<v Speaker 1>two channels and it was like two </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative universes.</v>

1328
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:59.360
<v Speaker 1>There are different worlds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different worlds of focus,</v>

1329
01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:02.240
<v Speaker 1>different worlds of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're projecting.</v>

1330
01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1331
01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.870
<v Speaker 1>buT I don't think the point is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be down the middle.</v>

1332
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:07.603
<v Speaker 1>I think it has to be deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what I think is so powerful </v>

1333
01:10:09.771 --> 01:10:12.080
<v Speaker 1>about podcasting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

1334
01:10:12.081 --> 01:10:14.660
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you get people to listen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1335
01:10:14.661 --> 01:10:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you talk about an idea for an hour or </v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>

1336
01:10:17.421 --> 01:10:18.254
<v Speaker 1>some of them three hours is astonishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally astonishing in an age where </v>

1337
01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:24.013
<v Speaker 1>the most a cable news channel will </v>
<v Speaker 1>allocate to a new store is a minute and </v>

1338
01:10:27.861 --> 01:10:28.730
<v Speaker 1>a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two minutes,</v>

1339
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:30.170
<v Speaker 1>three minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1340
01:10:30.171 --> 01:10:32.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the context of the tweet,</v>

1341
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:37.130
<v Speaker 1>thinking of cable news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't afford to go deep on anything</v>

1342
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>and everything they're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about are the things they can talk about</v>

1343
01:10:40.551 --> 01:10:43.670
<v Speaker 1>sensibly in 25 seconds or 30 seconds or </v>
<v Speaker 1>40 seconds.</v>

1344
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:44.990
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1345
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:45.824
<v Speaker 1>because you've lived this life of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>having deep conversations about things </v>

1346
01:10:48.141 --> 01:10:52.010
<v Speaker 1>that are important is that it sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes more than 30 seconds to understand</v>

1347
01:10:52.011 --> 01:10:53.120
<v Speaker 1>something always.</v>

1348
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the point is if we have media that's</v>

1349
01:10:55.611 --> 01:10:59.930
<v Speaker 1>focused at the 32nd chunk and that's how</v>
<v Speaker 1>America understands the issues.</v>

1350
01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:00.793
<v Speaker 1>We're never gonna get anywhere and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only way to get to get someplace is to </v>

1351
01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:08.480
<v Speaker 1>begin to have conversations that are at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hour long chunk or the two hour long</v>

1352
01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:09.314
<v Speaker 1>chuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not important that that be </v>

1353
01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:14.400
<v Speaker 1>neutral or balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if it's balanced.</v>

1354
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:15.653
<v Speaker 1>I care that it is attempting to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious and in depth understanding the </v>

1355
01:11:19.621 --> 01:11:20.454
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't care if keto wants to have </v>

1356
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:22.913
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to tell us the deep story of </v>

1357
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:27.270
<v Speaker 1>iron randy and economics or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

1358
01:11:27.271 --> 01:11:28.290
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

1359
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important that people start</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about these issues in a richer,</v>

1360
01:11:32.461 --> 01:11:33.294
<v Speaker 1>deeper way and I think the challenge we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have now is how do we begin to produce </v>

1361
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:38.813
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing that the world of walter </v>

1362
01:11:41.101 --> 01:11:44.220
<v Speaker 1>cronkite is never coming back and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a good thing,</v>

1363
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:45.900
<v Speaker 1>but it is just never coming back.</v>

1364
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:50.550
<v Speaker 1>And the world of sean hannity is a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will destroy democracy.</v>

1365
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:53.610
<v Speaker 1>So how do we rebuild democracy outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that and you know,</v>

1366
01:11:53.611 --> 01:11:55.480
<v Speaker 1>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to pick the three things that</v>

1367
01:11:55.481 --> 01:11:58.410
<v Speaker 1>have the most hopeful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think podcasting is number one.</v>

1368
01:11:58.890 --> 01:12:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the reflective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep,</v>

1369
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:02.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>

1370
01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:04.440
<v Speaker 1>playful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the end,</v>

1371
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:07.290
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the hour long segment of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

1372
01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:09.180
<v Speaker 1>you understand something you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand before.</v>

1373
01:12:09.181 --> 01:12:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think comedy like comedy television,</v>

1374
01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:14.363
<v Speaker 1>like brings pEople into understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in a way that's not possible on </v>

1375
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:19.590
<v Speaker 1>fox news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1376
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:20.483
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as number two I think shows like </v>

1377
01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:25.700
<v Speaker 1>homeland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you watch homeland,</v>

1378
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:26.843
<v Speaker 1>watched it until the redheaded guy died </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that went through this dark </v>

1379
01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:33.840
<v Speaker 1>period in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the recent seasons or just unfucking</v>

1380
01:12:33.841 --> 01:12:34.674
<v Speaker 1>believable and because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable because they are such a </v>

1381
01:12:38.071 --> 01:12:42.180
<v Speaker 1>deep rich understanding of the tensions </v>
<v Speaker 1>at issue.</v>

1382
01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:43.043
<v Speaker 1>Like you won't understand the Iran </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear deal watched the last season </v>

1383
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:52.260
<v Speaker 1>because after watching that season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like understand the tensions between</v>

1384
01:12:52.261 --> 01:12:56.100
<v Speaker 1>the cia and the president and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going on with Israel.</v>

1385
01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:57.383
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that if you imagine </v>

1386
01:12:58.860 --> 01:12:59.693
<v Speaker 1>television shows aspiring to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story in an entertaining way and in a </v>

1387
01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.170
<v Speaker 1>way that brings people in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they voluntarily want to watch it.</v>

1388
01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.590
<v Speaker 1>But that in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of watching a season,</v>

1389
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:11.424
<v Speaker 1>you understand something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand the current season's about </v>

1390
01:13:13.081 --> 01:13:14.080
<v Speaker 1>the Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1391
01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:15.083
<v Speaker 1>struggle and I can't wait to watch it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's going to be a richer </v>

1392
01:13:17.581 --> 01:13:20.070
<v Speaker 1>understanding of that story than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything on television.</v>

1393
01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch house of cards?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did up until the season.</v>

1394
01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Did you quit at this season?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the season.</v>

1395
01:13:26.971 --> 01:13:30.380
<v Speaker 1>I was very disappointed by watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>episode one and I said this,</v>

1396
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:31.223
<v Speaker 1>it seems like they gave it to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>different writers and it's this </v>

1397
01:13:32.871 --> 01:13:33.440
<v Speaker 1>craziness.</v>

1398
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.273
<v Speaker 1>It just seemed like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody just got ahold of it and </v>

1399
01:13:37.161 --> 01:13:37.994
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll take it and I want to write it my </v>

1400
01:13:39.061 --> 01:13:40.140
<v Speaker 1>own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1401
01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:41.610
<v Speaker 1>But even in the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1402
01:13:41.611 --> 01:13:42.444
<v Speaker 1>the striking thing about house of cards </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it made it seem like stuff actually </v>

1403
01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:47.200
<v Speaker 1>could happen in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1404
01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.061
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1405
01:13:48.061 --> 01:13:48.894
<v Speaker 1>that's really powerful guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frank underwood actually can actually </v>

1406
01:13:50.941 --> 01:13:54.120
<v Speaker 1>get important bills passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember watching that same.</v>

1407
01:13:54.150 --> 01:13:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just completely not the truth.</v>

1408
01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.520
<v Speaker 1>This is just not the way the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

1409
01:13:59.521 --> 01:14:00.354
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be good if it worked like that </v>

1410
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:02.724
<v Speaker 1>because at least it could do stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way it actually works is that </v>

1411
01:14:05.971 --> 01:14:08.280
<v Speaker 1>these guys would be scurrying around </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out,</v>

1412
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:09.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the tentacles of funders are </v>

1413
01:14:10.651 --> 01:14:14.980
<v Speaker 1>directing them to do and the tentacles </v>
<v Speaker 1>of funders added together would be don't</v>

1414
01:14:14.981 --> 01:14:15.760
<v Speaker 1>do anything.</v>

1415
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:20.760
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you're there to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what it did is sort of highlight the</v>

1416
01:14:22.181 --> 01:14:23.014
<v Speaker 1>influences these people experience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it showed how deeply entrenched </v>

1417
01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:30.100
<v Speaker 1>everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1418
01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:31.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to talk it down at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1419
01:14:31.871 --> 01:14:32.704
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want a million different things like </v>

1420
01:14:35.021 --> 01:14:35.854
<v Speaker 1>this on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just something that gives people just </v>

1421
01:14:38.471 --> 01:14:40.240
<v Speaker 1>give them a richer understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1422
01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:42.700
<v Speaker 1>an understanding period because for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most part,</v>

1423
01:14:42.701 --> 01:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>what people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go to school,</v>

1424
01:14:44.711 --> 01:14:45.544
<v Speaker 1>you learn about democracy and our system</v>
<v Speaker 1>of representative government and then </v>

1425
01:14:49.361 --> 01:14:50.194
<v Speaker 1>you become an adult and you forget most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you learned and then you hear </v>

1426
01:14:53.501 --> 01:14:57.080
<v Speaker 1>something about the electoral college </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the popular vote and you know,</v>

1427
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:59.440
<v Speaker 1>and then you see bills getting passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1428
01:14:59.441 --> 01:15:00.274
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that and this and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff you learn at school is so </v>

1429
01:15:03.041 --> 01:15:03.874
<v Speaker 1>politically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>IT can't actually give you an </v>

1430
01:15:05.351 --> 01:15:06.280
<v Speaker 1>understanding of anything.</v>

1431
01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Like you actually taught kids in high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school the way congress worked.</v>

1432
01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.513
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the school board would go crazy and </v>

1433
01:15:12.791 --> 01:15:13.081
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1434
01:15:13.081 --> 01:15:13.231
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1435
01:15:13.231 --> 01:15:14.064
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't talk down american democracy </v>

1436
01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:17.590
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the truth is not teachable.</v>

1437
01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:18.693
<v Speaker 1>The only way to get people to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is to expose it to them in a way </v>

1438
01:15:21.551 --> 01:15:23.260
<v Speaker 1>that they want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1439
01:15:23.261 --> 01:15:25.750
<v Speaker 1>my point is that's not going to be fox </v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

1440
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:27.783
<v Speaker 1>Fox news can never cover it at the depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the interest level that it needs to </v>

1441
01:15:30.341 --> 01:15:32.920
<v Speaker 1>be covered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be things like what you do</v>

1442
01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:38.700
<v Speaker 1>or things like what great television can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is our system of government analogous</v>

1443
01:15:38.741 --> 01:15:39.574
<v Speaker 1>to like taking like dos or windows 95 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and just continuing </v>

1444
01:15:44.711 --> 01:15:45.544
<v Speaker 1>to patch it and never revisit it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never come up with a new operating </v>

1445
01:15:48.191 --> 01:15:48.910
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1446
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:49.743
<v Speaker 1>I think the better analogy is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>operating system that has been taken </v>

1447
01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:58.560
<v Speaker 1>over by malware virus because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>innocent,</v>

1448
01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:01.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dos,</v>

1449
01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:01.893
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a fun system and that like </v>

1450
01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:03.993
<v Speaker 1>cranked to a halt after awhile when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to pile more and more on </v>

1451
01:16:06.371 --> 01:16:07.204
<v Speaker 1>top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was just kind of the limits of </v>

1452
01:16:08.201 --> 01:16:09.034
<v Speaker 1>what it could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing malicious in its </v>

1453
01:16:11.081 --> 01:16:12.410
<v Speaker 1>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1454
01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:14.770
<v Speaker 1>but there's something malicious in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

1455
01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:19.830
<v Speaker 1>There are people who are eagerly focused</v>
<v Speaker 1>on how to make sure our government can't</v>

1456
01:16:20.351 --> 01:16:23.290
<v Speaker 1>govern because if our government can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>govern,</v>

1457
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.390
<v Speaker 1>they win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1458
01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:31.030
<v Speaker 1>the koch brothers have this amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse bipolar character.</v>

1459
01:16:31.031 --> 01:16:31.864
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about the ideals of </v>

1460
01:16:32.711 --> 01:16:33.544
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is their interventions </v>

1461
01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:40.000
<v Speaker 1>make it so we don't have an epa that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulate their companies.</v>

1462
01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:40.953
<v Speaker 1>So basically we have environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy that leaves their companies </v>

1463
01:16:43.781 --> 01:16:44.614
<v Speaker 1>alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they can make tons of money </v>

1464
01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:47.314
<v Speaker 1>by polluting our environment without </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever having to pay the consequence of </v>

1465
01:16:50.051 --> 01:16:50.170
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1466
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:54.490
<v Speaker 1>And what they want is not change of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular kind except for tax cuts.</v>

1467
01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:57.380
<v Speaker 1>What they want is nothing to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1468
01:16:57.610 --> 01:16:58.443
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the kind of malware that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken over the system of our government </v>

1469
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:04.510
<v Speaker 1>has blocked the ability to government to</v>
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

1470
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.750
<v Speaker 1>and rather than having leaders at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center who say,</v>

1471
01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:08.584
<v Speaker 1>hold it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just pause for a second and </v>

1472
01:17:10.611 --> 01:17:11.444
<v Speaker 1>realize this is a fucking broken system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have politicians that continue to </v>

1473
01:17:14.601 --> 01:17:15.434
<v Speaker 1>pretend as if everything's working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to elect more democrats </v>

1474
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:19.790
<v Speaker 1>and we'll get what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1475
01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:21.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm voting online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would be the pitfalls of that and </v>

1476
01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.920
<v Speaker 1>why hasn't that been implemented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can bank online,</v>

1477
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:31.490
<v Speaker 1>why can't you vote online?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

1478
01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the tech,</v>

1479
01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:33.933
<v Speaker 1>the experts who are disinterested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning they're not working for default </v>

1480
01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:38.713
<v Speaker 1>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would tell you that we don't yet have </v>

1481
01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 1>the infrastructure to be able to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>confident about this.</v>

1482
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of people working on,</v>

1483
01:17:46.190 --> 01:17:51.190
<v Speaker 1>I think really great open source </v>
<v Speaker 1>implementations that that could be,</v>

1484
01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:52.933
<v Speaker 1>could eventually produce the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence that we need to have to be </v>

1485
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:56.114
<v Speaker 1>able to vote online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't foreclose it in the long </v>

1486
01:17:59.811 --> 01:18:01.490
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what we've seen in the short</v>

1487
01:18:01.491 --> 01:18:02.324
<v Speaker 1>run is that when we turn to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>proprietary providers of technology to </v>

1488
01:18:07.791 --> 01:18:10.640
<v Speaker 1>enable us to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give us shit.</v>

1489
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1490
01:18:11.470 --> 01:18:12.860
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at these voting machines.</v>

1491
01:18:12.861 --> 01:18:17.861
<v Speaker 1>There was a recent story about his 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>year old who was able to,</v>

1492
01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:19.673
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within like 15 minutes hack into the </v>

1493
01:18:21.321 --> 01:18:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Florida election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1494
01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:24.793
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1495
01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.130
<v Speaker 1>system and change the results from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1496
01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.720
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one candidate to another.</v>

1497
01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:31.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1498
01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.880
<v Speaker 1>the companies that build these </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies are not filled with a bunch</v>

1499
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:37.070
<v Speaker 1>of rocket science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're really good,</v>

1500
01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:39.890
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go work for google or </v>
<v Speaker 1>for facebook or something like that.</v>

1501
01:18:39.890 --> 01:18:40.723
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the proprietary software has all of </v>

1502
01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:47.340
<v Speaker 1>these bugs and holes and intended back </v>
<v Speaker 1>doors built into it.</v>

1503
01:18:47.341 --> 01:18:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Intended back towards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1504
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:49.760
<v Speaker 1>because they need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1505
01:18:49.761 --> 01:18:52.910
<v Speaker 1>the company itself needs a simple way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get into check or to fix things,</v>

1506
01:18:52.911 --> 01:18:53.744
<v Speaker 1>but then they worry about the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people will get back doors to be </v>

1507
01:18:56.241 --> 01:18:58.760
<v Speaker 1>able to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the argument for diebold system</v>

1508
01:18:58.761 --> 01:19:03.761
<v Speaker 1>that did have a third party entrance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tons of allegations about that.</v>

1509
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see the documentary hacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracies?</v>

1510
01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Is that disturbing to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredibly.</v>

1511
01:19:09.501 --> 01:19:10.334
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much I believe about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a well because I've seen so much </v>

1512
01:19:14.271 --> 01:19:18.500
<v Speaker 1>that contradicts some of the claims </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the extent to which there was real</v>

1513
01:19:18.501 --> 01:19:21.650
<v Speaker 1>differences in the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember at that election really being</v>

1514
01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.100
<v Speaker 1>anxious about it because it seemed to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Ohio in particular,</v>

1515
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:30.020
<v Speaker 1>a really compelling case was made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some something weird going on,</v>

1516
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.450
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is not so much the particulars</v>

1517
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.500
<v Speaker 1>of a particular election.</v>

1518
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:34.633
<v Speaker 1>It's recognizing that if you turn this </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to proprietary software companies </v>

1519
01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.090
<v Speaker 1>who are going to build these closed </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems,</v>

1520
01:19:41.091 --> 01:19:41.924
<v Speaker 1>nobody can inspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to trust them and you </v>

1521
01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:45.584
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think they are intending to make </v>

1522
01:19:47.541 --> 01:19:48.374
<v Speaker 1>themselves vulnerable to the russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just going to make themselves </v>

1523
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:51.314
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to the russians and there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative systems like open source </v>

1524
01:19:54.171 --> 01:19:55.004
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something I know some people are </v>

1525
01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:58.190
<v Speaker 1>building right now that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually could get us there.</v>

1526
01:19:58.450 --> 01:20:02.180
<v Speaker 1>An open source system like linux based,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that would go onto your phone.</v>

1527
01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.553
<v Speaker 1>Well it could be on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point about the open source is </v>

1528
01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:06.980
<v Speaker 1>that anybody can inspect the</v>

1529
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:10.950
<v Speaker 2>and be confident that the code is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it says.</v>

1530
01:20:10.951 --> 01:20:11.784
<v Speaker 2>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1531
01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:13.043
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying about being on your </v>
<v Speaker 3>phone as the biometrics that we use on </v>

1532
01:20:15.311 --> 01:20:16.144
<v Speaker 3>our phone today or some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>secure in terms of like being able to </v>

1533
01:20:19.961 --> 01:20:20.794
<v Speaker 3>establish that it's you that's making </v>
<v Speaker 3>that vote like iris scanners that you </v>

1534
01:20:23.381 --> 01:20:25.180
<v Speaker 3>have on the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a samsung note,</v>

1535
01:20:25.181 --> 01:20:27.550
<v Speaker 3>nine that has an iris scanner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>checks my eyeballs.</v>

1536
01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:30.610
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're my iphone checks my face.</v>

1537
01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:31.780
<v Speaker 3>takes the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1538
01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:32.643
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're pretty amazing fingerprints </v>

1539
01:20:34.541 --> 01:20:35.374
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the fact that this is probably in </v>

1540
01:20:38.561 --> 01:20:41.890
<v Speaker 3>terms of our own personal security in </v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of information,</v>

1541
01:20:42.010 --> 01:20:42.843
<v Speaker 3>this is probably the most secure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our smartphones are probably the most </v>

1542
01:20:45.251 --> 01:20:47.080
<v Speaker 3>secure devices we've ever possessed.</v>

1543
01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.110
<v Speaker 2>So on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1544
01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:54.490
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I say I agree with you </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the long run we should imagine a</v>

1545
01:20:54.491 --> 01:20:56.200
<v Speaker 2>world where to be trivially easy to </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote,</v>

1546
01:20:56.201 --> 01:21:01.201
<v Speaker 2>just like it's easy for me to venmo you </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a cash app,</v>

1547
01:21:01.331 --> 01:21:03.010
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's your favorite here.</v>

1548
01:21:03.011 --> 01:21:03.844
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1549
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:05.123
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money that should be the way the future </v>

1550
01:21:06.221 --> 01:21:07.660
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>

1551
01:21:07.661 --> 01:21:08.494
<v Speaker 2>we need to realize that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies are also incredibly </v>

1552
01:21:11.801 --> 01:21:12.634
<v Speaker 2>insecure in the sense that there is now </v>
<v Speaker 2>a commercial market to exploit a </v>

1553
01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.400
<v Speaker 2>insecurities inside of these phones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1554
01:21:21.401 --> 01:21:21.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1555
01:21:21.810 --> 01:21:25.180
<v Speaker 2>these companies basically have bounties </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they post on the web,</v>

1556
01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:26.293
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For people who will come forward and </v>

1557
01:21:27.611 --> 01:21:30.880
<v Speaker 2>find certain holes and hacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And once they get those hacks,</v>

1558
01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:32.853
<v Speaker 2>they use them to leverage power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And governments play this game all the </v>

1559
01:21:36.971 --> 01:21:37.691
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1560
01:21:37.691 --> 01:21:42.691
<v Speaker 2>there's a pretty strong argument that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the murder was a product of one of these</v>

1561
01:21:43.751 --> 01:21:44.584
<v Speaker 2>exploits which was then going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>revealed and the need to cover up the </v>

1562
01:21:48.161 --> 01:21:50.050
<v Speaker 2>fact that there was such an exploit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1563
01:21:50.170 --> 01:21:51.460
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know this.</v>

1564
01:21:51.461 --> 01:21:52.570
<v Speaker 2>What is this about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's.</v>

1565
01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.190
<v Speaker 2>So the basic idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1566
01:21:54.490 --> 01:21:56.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these companies and many of them,</v>

1567
01:21:56.290 --> 01:21:57.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most prominent ones here,</v>

1568
01:21:57.881 --> 01:21:58.714
<v Speaker 2>israeli companies who facilitate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability of governments to buy access to </v>

1569
01:22:03.821 --> 01:22:05.200
<v Speaker 2>your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1570
01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:07.770
<v Speaker 2>And the standard way in which this has </v>
<v Speaker 2>done is to,</v>

1571
01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:11.770
<v Speaker 2>is to pierce the security by sending you</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you click on it,</v>

1572
01:22:11.771 --> 01:22:12.604
<v Speaker 2>it then embeds itself in the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no way you see it in a way </v>

1573
01:22:15.821 --> 01:22:18.650
<v Speaker 2>that it can be blocked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>

1574
01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:19.653
<v Speaker 2>there's rumors now that in fact we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got something more than that going on </v>

1575
01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:22.804
<v Speaker 2>where all they need to do is get your </v>
<v Speaker 2>telephone number and they're able to </v>

1576
01:22:24.221 --> 01:22:26.290
<v Speaker 2>hack into the system to get access to </v>
<v Speaker 2>your phone.</v>

1577
01:22:26.680 --> 01:22:27.513
<v Speaker 2>But the point is these companies have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>market now for selling this type of </v>

1578
01:22:34.180 --> 01:22:34.810
<v Speaker 2>insecurity.</v>

1579
01:22:34.810 --> 01:22:35.643
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sell the ability for you to get access </v>

1580
01:22:37.541 --> 01:22:39.210
<v Speaker 2>here and the story that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1581
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a lot of reasons to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1582
01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:43.673
<v Speaker 2>to be absolutely confident about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>except that I trust the person who's </v>

1583
01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.880
<v Speaker 2>inside the security world that says this</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

1584
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knoW,</v>

1585
01:22:50.221 --> 01:22:53.330
<v Speaker 2>the story is that this is part of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in the [inaudible] context,</v>

1586
01:22:53.331 --> 01:22:57.370
<v Speaker 2>that the saudis have exploited this in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that was going to be revealed.</v>

1587
01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:01.330
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the simple solution to that eventual</v>

1588
01:23:01.331 --> 01:23:03.910
<v Speaker 2>revelation was to remove the person who </v>
<v Speaker 2>would reveal it.</v>

1589
01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:04.870
<v Speaker 2>And that's why.</v>

1590
01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:06.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1591
01:23:06.821 --> 01:23:07.654
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point about the recognize at these </v>

1592
01:23:08.591 --> 01:23:12.130
<v Speaker 1>funds on the one hand for the ordinary </v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1593
01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:14.080
<v Speaker 1>it's more secure than anything you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever had,</v>

1594
01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:15.453
<v Speaker 1>but in the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>systematically it's building insecurity </v>

1595
01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:22.540
<v Speaker 1>into our lives in a way that can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited by powerful people.</v>

1596
01:23:23.470 --> 01:23:25.240
<v Speaker 1>And for most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't matter.</v>

1597
01:23:25.241 --> 01:23:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Like most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary,</v>

1598
01:23:27.220 --> 01:23:29.320
<v Speaker 1>ordinary joes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1599
01:23:29.410 --> 01:23:30.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

1600
01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:30.933
<v Speaker 1>they're never going to be vulnerable </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody's going to spend a </v>

1601
01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:35.320
<v Speaker 1>million dollars to get a hack against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual person.</v>

1602
01:23:35.321 --> 01:23:36.154
<v Speaker 1>When I hear that from a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifying why they don't worry about </v>

1603
01:23:38.891 --> 01:23:39.970
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it drives me crazy.</v>

1604
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.190
<v Speaker 1>I can't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they going to do?</v>

1605
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:44.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm a clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about me,</v>

1606
01:23:45.010 --> 01:23:45.843
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what we're doing when we're </v>

1607
01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:47.913
<v Speaker 1>talking about right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if we have a system where </v>

1608
01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:50.224
<v Speaker 1>systematically powerful people can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>push a button and like find a way to </v>

1609
01:23:53.710 --> 01:23:56.760
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can control anybody jamal custodian,</v>

1610
01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:02.380
<v Speaker 1>then we've got a system that no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it possible for ordinary people to</v>

1611
01:24:02.381 --> 01:24:03.820
<v Speaker 1>stand up to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1612
01:24:03.850 --> 01:24:05.850
<v Speaker 1>that's basically what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is the,</v>

1613
01:24:05.890 --> 01:24:06.723
<v Speaker 1>this is a structure that allows powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>people if it is insecure to protect </v>

1614
01:24:11.081 --> 01:24:14.200
<v Speaker 1>themselves because they can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage that against us.</v>

1615
01:24:14.201 --> 01:24:14.921
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1616
01:24:14.921 --> 01:24:15.754
<v Speaker 1>this is a completely an focused problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like nobody is talking about this </v>

1617
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:23.440
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the market for this commercialized x</v>

1618
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:28.660
<v Speaker 1>security exploits is hugely important </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've got to find a way to,</v>

1619
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.613
<v Speaker 1>to address it.</v>

1620
01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:36.420
<v Speaker 1>So is it feasible that as technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>advances and as the security advances as</v>

1621
01:24:39.191 --> 01:24:41.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the biometrics that we have today</v>

1622
01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:45.010
<v Speaker 1>are far greater than the passwords that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we use just a few years ago,</v>

1623
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:48.850
<v Speaker 1>that there could be something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't exploit,</v>

1624
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:49.953
<v Speaker 1>especially considering open source </v>
<v Speaker 1>variance where they can be checked by </v>

1625
01:24:53.111 --> 01:24:53.900
<v Speaker 1>the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.520
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1627
01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:57.533
<v Speaker 1>so the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not the kind of particular </v>

1628
01:24:59.351 --> 01:25:02.230
<v Speaker 1>technologies working the way you intend </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to work.</v>

1629
01:25:02.430 --> 01:25:03.263
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got great biometric </v>

1630
01:25:04.061 --> 01:25:04.894
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are really good at making sure in </v>

1631
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:11.440
<v Speaker 1>the ordinary case that you're the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>person using your phone.</v>

1632
01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:17.330
<v Speaker 1>The problem iS the code is so big and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated that there's always going to</v>

1633
01:25:19.241 --> 01:25:20.074
<v Speaker 1>be little bugs inside the code and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>these exploits are are like coders who </v>

1634
01:25:25.391 --> 01:25:26.224
<v Speaker 1>like poke at the code looking for these </v>
<v Speaker 1>little hooks and they link one hook to </v>

1635
01:25:31.421 --> 01:25:32.254
<v Speaker 1>another hook to another hook and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they find the way in to exploit the </v>

1636
01:25:34.571 --> 01:25:36.670
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the exploits are never.</v>

1637
01:25:37.020 --> 01:25:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Well I shouldn't say never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another story.</v>

1638
01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:40.600
<v Speaker 1>It's important to recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about that a second,</v>

1639
01:25:40.601 --> 01:25:43.870
<v Speaker 1>but the exploits are not in the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>case intended by anybody.</v>

1640
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:45.123
<v Speaker 1>It's just the un.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the natural consequence of </v>

1641
01:25:47.411 --> 01:25:48.244
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1642
01:25:48.370 --> 01:25:53.170
<v Speaker 1>literally hundreds or millions of lines </v>
<v Speaker 1>of code that go into making this machine</v>

1643
01:25:53.171 --> 01:25:54.004
<v Speaker 1>work and that's what's beinG exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a world like the </v>

1644
01:25:56.771 --> 01:25:59.650
<v Speaker 1>iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is mono culture,</v>

1645
01:25:59.830 --> 01:26:00.341
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1646
01:26:00.341 --> 01:26:01.174
<v Speaker 1>everybody has the same operatinG system </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it seemed versions of the </v>

1647
01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:04.070
<v Speaker 1>operating system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find</v>

1648
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.903
<v Speaker 2>an exploit in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ios and apple doesn't know about </v>

1649
01:26:08.571 --> 01:26:09.430
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1650
01:26:09.490 --> 01:26:11.660
<v Speaker 2>and you can exploit it for six months or</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year.</v>

1651
01:26:11.661 --> 01:26:12.494
<v Speaker 2>You can do a lot of damage to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's lives before anybody gets </v>

1652
01:26:15.441 --> 01:26:16.610
<v Speaker 2>around to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to blocking it.</v>

1653
01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1654
01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:18.733
<v Speaker 2>that's even in the best case where </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's working hard to make their </v>

1655
01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:24.110
<v Speaker 2>system as secure as it can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be,</v>

1656
01:26:24.111 --> 01:26:24.944
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this period after the nine </v>

1657
01:26:28.491 --> 01:26:30.580
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 when there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1658
01:26:30.650 --> 01:26:31.483
<v Speaker 2>very strong and credible allegations </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the United States government went </v>

1659
01:26:33.471 --> 01:26:36.260
<v Speaker 2>around to these technology companies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

1660
01:26:36.261 --> 01:26:39.470
<v Speaker 2>we need you to build back doors into </v>
<v Speaker 2>your technology.</v>

1661
01:26:39.471 --> 01:26:40.304
<v Speaker 2>So we can track down the terrorists and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's strong allegations that in fact </v>

1662
01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:48.881
<v Speaker 2>many of the most important technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies complied and what they quickly</v>

1663
01:26:49.101 --> 01:26:49.934
<v Speaker 2>discovered is that the backdoor is </v>
<v Speaker 2>intended for the United States </v>

1664
01:26:52.311 --> 01:26:53.144
<v Speaker 2>government trying to attack terrorists </v>
<v Speaker 2>were being exploited by the chinese </v>

1665
01:26:55.731 --> 01:26:58.250
<v Speaker 2>trying to steal trade secrets from </v>
<v Speaker 2>american company.</v>

1666
01:26:58.251 --> 01:26:59.084
<v Speaker 2>So this infrastructure that was intended</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be secure to protect american </v>

1667
01:27:02.061 --> 01:27:02.894
<v Speaker 2>companies so that they could do their </v>
<v Speaker 2>work without being asked for an </v>

1668
01:27:06.891 --> 01:27:07.724
<v Speaker 2>espionage on top of them became an </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure of espionage again </v>

1669
01:27:10.881 --> 01:27:15.170
<v Speaker 2>because it's so complicated to get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly right.</v>

1670
01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.460
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1671
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:21.460
<v Speaker 2>the return from exploit is so huge that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can just expect the market is always</v>

1672
01:27:21.861 --> 01:27:22.694
<v Speaker 2>going to supply it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was the other example that you're </v>

1673
01:27:24.381 --> 01:27:25.214
<v Speaker 2>going to bring up that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the idea was that the intended </v>

1674
01:27:27.390 --> 01:27:30.770
<v Speaker 2>backdoors that turn out to be exploited </v>
<v Speaker 2>for other purposes,</v>

1675
01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:33.403
<v Speaker 3>but isn't the system itself like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you deal with the hanging chads or pay </v>

1676
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:40.520
<v Speaker 3>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their counters ridiculous.</v>

1677
01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:43.790
<v Speaker 3>You're living giving it up to human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

1678
01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:46.700
<v Speaker 3>The potential for errors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Massive,</v>

1679
01:27:46.770 --> 01:27:49.040
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to count things up or the potential</v>

1680
01:27:49.041 --> 01:27:49.874
<v Speaker 3>for corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The decision to ignore certain </v>

1681
01:27:51.921 --> 01:27:53.250
<v Speaker 3>collections,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>

1682
01:27:53.251 --> 01:27:54.620
<v Speaker 3>this has all been documented,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1683
01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:55.623
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of this follows from the fact </v>

1684
01:27:57.401 --> 01:27:59.020
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bizarrely in America,</v>

1685
01:27:59.021 --> 01:28:02.020
<v Speaker 2>unlike most mature democracies around </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

1686
01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.830
<v Speaker 2>make the running of elections a partisan</v>
<v Speaker 2>event like,</v>

1687
01:28:05.831 --> 01:28:06.664
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>republicans in a district or democrats </v>

1688
01:28:08.801 --> 01:28:10.960
<v Speaker 2>in a district control the voting </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems.</v>

1689
01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Like why the hell would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we have like people who,</v>

1690
01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:19.510
<v Speaker 2>who self identity and professional </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework is nonpartisan,</v>

1691
01:28:19.540 --> 01:28:21.700
<v Speaker 2>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like election commission.</v>

1692
01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.541
<v Speaker 2>That's about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1693
01:28:22.541 --> 01:28:26.830
<v Speaker 2>it's above the partisan bow so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no incentive in Georgia,</v>

1694
01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:28.023
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the government to allocate money to </v>

1695
01:28:30.761 --> 01:28:31.594
<v Speaker 2>fix voting machines just in republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>districts and not in democratic </v>

1696
01:28:34.361 --> 01:28:39.160
<v Speaker 2>districts or there's no incentive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shut down a voting polling place,</v>

1697
01:28:39.161 --> 01:28:39.994
<v Speaker 2>which they did in Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making it so that people in that area </v>

1698
01:28:41.861 --> 01:28:44.020
<v Speaker 2>would have to go huge distance to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>able to vote,</v>

1699
01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:45.273
<v Speaker 2>were to create it so that it takes seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours to vote in some districts and 20 </v>

1700
01:28:48.161 --> 01:28:49.390
<v Speaker 2>minutes to vote in other districts.</v>

1701
01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:50.223
<v Speaker 2>There's no incentive to do that if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>job is simply to make it possible for </v>

1702
01:28:53.681 --> 01:28:55.910
<v Speaker 2>people to vote efficiently and if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure you and,</v>

1703
01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.773
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and reward you based on how easy have </v>

1704
01:28:59.171 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 2>you made it for people in this state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>devote easily and efficiently.</v>

1705
01:29:02.730 --> 01:29:03.563
<v Speaker 2>We don't get that kind of efficiencY.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't get that kind of innovation </v>

1706
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:08.730
<v Speaker 2>because it's a rigged game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1707
01:29:08.731 --> 01:29:10.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have people who,</v>

1708
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:14.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure many of these people are above </v>
<v Speaker 2>partisan motivation,</v>

1709
01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:15.653
<v Speaker 2>but we also know that many of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people are deeply motivated by partisan </v>

1710
01:29:18.031 --> 01:29:18.864
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially at that kind of middle level </v>

1711
01:29:20.581 --> 01:29:21.414
<v Speaker 2>of party politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if theY can set it up so that their </v>

1712
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:25.164
<v Speaker 2>side winds because of the way they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>played the game for allocating voting </v>

1713
01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:30.780
<v Speaker 2>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then more power to them.</v>

1714
01:29:30.781 --> 01:29:31.614
<v Speaker 2>And that'S exactly what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Georgia with this recent governor's </v>

1715
01:29:33.661 --> 01:29:34.494
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That kind of outrageous that the man </v>

1716
01:29:36.271 --> 01:29:37.104
<v Speaker 2>running the election system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary of state does not resign from </v>

1717
01:29:41.341 --> 01:29:42.174
<v Speaker 2>this job as he runs for governor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the governorship is decided in such </v>

1718
01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:49.950
<v Speaker 2>a very close way by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1719
01:29:50.100 --> 01:29:54.270
<v Speaker 2>the decisions that he made about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to throw people off.</v>

1720
01:29:54.271 --> 01:29:58.590
<v Speaker 2>The voting roles are which allocations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of voting system technology will be made</v>

1721
01:29:58.591 --> 01:29:59.424
<v Speaker 2>across the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a product or just making it </v>

1722
01:30:00.951 --> 01:30:03.060
<v Speaker 2>political.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could make it non political and might</v>

1723
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:04.980
<v Speaker 2>not have all of these kinds of problems</v>

1724
01:30:05.910 --> 01:30:06.743
<v Speaker 3>dealing with this very unique landscape </v>
<v Speaker 3>now of google and facebook and twitter </v>

1725
01:30:11.581 --> 01:30:12.414
<v Speaker 3>And instagram and all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>social media groups that have a vested </v>

1726
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:20.760
<v Speaker 3>interest in a specific narrative being </v>
<v Speaker 3>portrayed.</v>

1727
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:24.000
<v Speaker 3>And spi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing specifically is,</v>

1728
01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:26.190
<v Speaker 3>and this is being addressed right now in</v>
<v Speaker 3>congress,</v>

1729
01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:31.460
<v Speaker 3>is the discrimination against </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative voices and there's a lot of</v>

1730
01:30:31.981 --> 01:30:32.814
<v Speaker 3>denial that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's also a lot of evidence that </v>

1731
01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.473
<v Speaker 3>that is the case and that they feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have some moral or ethical </v>

1732
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:40.374
<v Speaker 3>obligation to suppress certain </v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative voices for whatever reason </v>

1733
01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:49.860
<v Speaker 3>and push the narrative of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of progressive and liberal voices.</v>

1734
01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:52.860
<v Speaker 3>This is a very strange thing because </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1735
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:53.783
<v Speaker 3>the amount of influence that something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like google or facebook has today is </v>

1736
01:30:57.511 --> 01:31:02.511
<v Speaker 3>arguably as great or greater than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>sean hannity's of the world and the cnns</v>

1737
01:31:03.931 --> 01:31:04.780
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1738
01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.800
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the traditional news outlets.</v>

1739
01:31:07.900 --> 01:31:09.130
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So no doubt.</v>

1740
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.863
<v Speaker 2>There's a big debate about whether they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were more important in 2016 than the </v>

1741
01:31:15.431 --> 01:31:17.230
<v Speaker 2>cable stations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My colleague yoke,</v>

1742
01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.870
<v Speaker 2>benkler has a book that argues pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerfully.</v>

1743
01:31:19.871 --> 01:31:20.704
<v Speaker 2>I think that it was actually the cable </v>
<v Speaker 2>stations that were more responsible for </v>

1744
01:31:23.381 --> 01:31:26.770
<v Speaker 2>the result then the facebooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but whether in 2016 they are,</v>

1745
01:31:26.771 --> 01:31:29.770
<v Speaker 2>the more powerful someday in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are going to be more powerful.</v>

1746
01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:31.720
<v Speaker 2>Certainly powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1747
01:31:32.130 --> 01:31:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

1748
01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:38.290
<v Speaker 2>the question is what we mean by bias or </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination here.</v>

1749
01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:38.891
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1750
01:31:38.891 --> 01:31:39.724
<v Speaker 2>in 2017 in the fall it was revealed that</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook was selling ads for people who </v>

1751
01:31:45.551 --> 01:31:48.460
<v Speaker 2>wanted to target quote jew haters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1752
01:31:48.461 --> 01:31:51.460
<v Speaker 2>So you could go and you could buy ads </v>
<v Speaker 2>for jew haters.</v>

1753
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:53.440
<v Speaker 2>Now there was never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did that work?</v>

1754
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:54.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1755
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1756
01:31:54.581 --> 01:31:57.460
<v Speaker 2>they have lots of categories you get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pick when you buy facebook ads,</v>

1757
01:31:57.490 --> 01:32:00.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberals or people who people over 60</v>

1758
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:01.023
<v Speaker 1>white armor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was one of the categories that was </v>

1759
01:32:02.441 --> 01:32:04.750
<v Speaker 1>exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could buy ads for jew haters.</v>

1760
01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:06.750
<v Speaker 1>There was an actual category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1761
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:07.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1762
01:32:07.690 --> 01:32:08.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there was never a time that a </v>

1763
01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:11.524
<v Speaker 1>facebook engineer or a marketing person </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided we ought to create a jew hater </v>

1764
01:32:15.251 --> 01:32:16.090
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1765
01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:20.860
<v Speaker 1>This is not a decision of any human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the product of the machine,</v>

1766
01:32:20.861 --> 01:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the ai that was developing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>categories based on what they saw people</v>

1767
01:32:24.431 --> 01:32:25.264
<v Speaker 1>happen to be interested in and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw up categories to see what sticks </v>

1768
01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:31.210
<v Speaker 1>and then certain categories stick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they run with them.</v>

1769
01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:33.220
<v Speaker 1>So it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>

1770
01:32:33.460 --> 01:32:34.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were the,</v>

1771
01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti defamation league,</v>

1772
01:32:36.101 --> 01:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>

1773
01:32:37.331 --> 01:32:42.331
<v Speaker 1>facebook is discriminating to encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>jew haters.</v>

1774
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:47.260
<v Speaker 1>But from another perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like the machines doing it,</v>

1775
01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:48.820
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1776
01:32:48.821 --> 01:32:49.654
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to what extent do you want to say </v>

1777
01:32:50.501 --> 01:32:51.550
<v Speaker 1>facebook is doing it?</v>

1778
01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And I Think that's off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's often what you're going to see in</v>

1779
01:32:54.791 --> 01:32:55.624
<v Speaker 1>this argument about whether they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote biasing the system against one </v>

1780
01:32:58.781 --> 01:32:59.770
<v Speaker 1>side or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1781
01:32:59.771 --> 01:33:00.604
<v Speaker 1>like this hilarious a hearing that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just held on capital hill two days ago </v>

1782
01:33:05.770 --> 01:33:06.603
<v Speaker 1>where a great congressman lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you don't want negative ad </v>

1783
01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:13.640
<v Speaker 1>results in the suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then don't do bad things.</v>

1784
01:33:13.641 --> 01:33:14.510
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1785
01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:15.281
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1786
01:33:15.281 --> 01:33:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I think this is quite fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really funny.</v>

1787
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:20.230
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like nobody's intent.</v>

1788
01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.420
<v Speaker 1>We should just explain that to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who don't know what we're talking about.</v>

1789
01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1790
01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:23.673
<v Speaker 1>so there was an argument about whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>google was tilting the ads to embarrass </v>

1791
01:33:27.700 --> 01:33:32.700
<v Speaker 1>one side or the other and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was a congressman from Iowa,</v>

1792
01:33:34.211 --> 01:33:35.044
<v Speaker 1>everybody like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the guy who didn't know that </v>

1793
01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:39.060
<v Speaker 1>google didn't make the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1794
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:40.030
<v Speaker 1>he got embarrassed.</v>

1795
01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:41.440
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was thIs,</v>

1796
01:33:41.441 --> 01:33:41.981
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1797
01:33:41.981 --> 01:33:42.814
<v Speaker 1>the exchange was basically here I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to show you a demonstration and </v>

1798
01:33:44.891 --> 01:33:49.210
<v Speaker 1>they put it in a certain name and </v>
<v Speaker 1>congressman smith and then up comes this</v>

1799
01:33:49.211 --> 01:33:52.460
<v Speaker 1>are referenced to his race baiting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1800
01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.313
<v Speaker 1>outraged by this and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one theory is you've got google </v>

1801
01:33:56.321 --> 01:33:58.990
<v Speaker 1>engineers down there saying let's get </v>
<v Speaker 1>congressman smith so we're going to make</v>

1802
01:33:58.991 --> 01:34:01.150
<v Speaker 1>it so every time you put smith in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>upcoming race baiting,</v>

1803
01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:02.510
<v Speaker 1>but google's response was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1804
01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:04.113
<v Speaker 1>we don't do individualized search </v>
<v Speaker 1>results like we give people what we </v>

1805
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:07.624
<v Speaker 1>think people want based on what they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done in the past and what they've shown </v>

1806
01:34:10.841 --> 01:34:13.240
<v Speaker 1>interest in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what's producing this,</v>

1807
01:34:13.241 --> 01:34:14.074
<v Speaker 1>hits the machine that's producing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>result and that let congress lou come </v>

1808
01:34:17.561 --> 01:34:19.960
<v Speaker 1>back with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like the connections,</v>

1809
01:34:19.961 --> 01:34:20.794
<v Speaker 1>than just don't enable them to be made </v>
<v Speaker 1>by doing things like don't do things </v>

1810
01:34:23.711 --> 01:34:24.850
<v Speaker 1>like race baiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1811
01:34:24.980 --> 01:34:27.340
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want negative search </v>
<v Speaker 1>results,</v>

1812
01:34:27.341 --> 01:34:29.590
<v Speaker 1>don't do negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty.</v>

1813
01:34:29.910 --> 01:34:30.743
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I do think tHat there's a really </v>

1814
01:34:31.871 --> 01:34:32.704
<v Speaker 1>hard problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say it's the machine is doing </v>

1815
01:34:36.221 --> 01:34:37.160
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1816
01:34:37.630 --> 01:34:41.170
<v Speaker 1>what's the future gonna be like when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can just say it's not my problem,</v>

1817
01:34:41.171 --> 01:34:43.830
<v Speaker 1>it's the machine that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just facebook though when,</v>

1818
01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:44.913
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or google rather when you're talking </v>

1819
01:34:47.111 --> 01:34:47.944
<v Speaker 1>about twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter has a different issue and their </v>

1820
01:34:50.981 --> 01:34:51.814
<v Speaker 1>issue is there's accusations of shadow </v>
<v Speaker 1>banning that they have decided that </v>

1821
01:34:56.141 --> 01:34:58.190
<v Speaker 1>they're going to silent voices</v>

1822
01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:59.023
<v Speaker 3>or make that much more difficult to find</v>
<v Speaker 3>or eliminate them from certain people's </v>

1823
01:35:02.751 --> 01:35:04.300
<v Speaker 3>feeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1824
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:06.190
<v Speaker 3>and they're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1825
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:09.920
<v Speaker 3>the allegation that they're doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>based on their own personal preferences,</v>

1826
01:35:09.921 --> 01:35:10.754
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their beliefs that they're progressive </v>

1827
01:35:13.581 --> 01:35:14.414
<v Speaker 3>ideology wants them to lean left and </v>
<v Speaker 3>somehow or another distribute that </v>

1828
01:35:21.411 --> 01:35:24.020
<v Speaker 3>information in a much more left leaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1829
01:35:24.570 --> 01:35:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And I hear these and I don't not an </v>
<v Speaker 2>expert on what they're doing.</v>

1830
01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:32.510
<v Speaker 2>And I wouldn't be surprised if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1831
01:35:32.610 --> 01:35:33.443
<v Speaker 2>certain complaints come in about certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeds and they say we're going to take </v>

1832
01:35:35.281 --> 01:35:37.740
<v Speaker 2>these off and that's the allegation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they haven't denied that.</v>

1833
01:35:38.910 --> 01:35:39.720
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1834
01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:42.080
<v Speaker 2>quite frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these feeds,</v>

1835
01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:43.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alex Jones stuff,</v>

1836
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:44.730
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1837
01:35:44.731 --> 01:35:45.564
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of your news show is </v>

1838
01:35:48.451 --> 01:35:49.284
<v Speaker 2>that somebody takes a gun to a pizza </v>
<v Speaker 2>shop in chicago in Washington to try to </v>

1839
01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.210
<v Speaker 2>prove that hillary clinton is running a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sex slave operation in the basement.</v>

1840
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:58.343
<v Speaker 2>There's something wrong with what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on their child second child sex </v>

1841
01:36:01.501 --> 01:36:02.334
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1842
01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:03.293
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I understand why they feel like </v>

1843
01:36:04.561 --> 01:36:06.770
<v Speaker 2>they're a responsible there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1844
01:36:06.810 --> 01:36:09.390
<v Speaker 2>it was recognized in the very beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These companies have said we're going to</v>

1845
01:36:09.391 --> 01:36:12.930
<v Speaker 2>try to create a certain kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment like so facebook required.</v>

1846
01:36:12.931 --> 01:36:13.764
<v Speaker 2>You identify yourself so that under the </v>
<v Speaker 2>shadows of anonymity you wouldn't be </v>

1847
01:36:17.191 --> 01:36:20.010
<v Speaker 2>causing wreaking lots of havoc inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>the system.</v>

1848
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:21.263
<v Speaker 2>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the more fundamental problem </v>

1849
01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:24.840
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I've said so far,</v>

1850
01:36:24.841 --> 01:36:26.640
<v Speaker 2>people like google and facebook might </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1851
01:36:26.641 --> 01:36:27.474
<v Speaker 2>here's stuff they're going to hate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The more fundamental problem here is </v>

1852
01:36:31.351 --> 01:36:32.184
<v Speaker 2>that we have no antitrust enforcement of</v>
<v Speaker 2>any of these companies against any of </v>

1853
01:36:35.281 --> 01:36:36.114
<v Speaker 2>these companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've allowed them to become so </v>

1854
01:36:37.981 --> 01:36:42.510
<v Speaker 2>incredibly powerful without any </v>
<v Speaker 2>justification under the law.</v>

1855
01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:43.593
<v Speaker 3>Isn't the issue though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this was never anticipated that </v>

1856
01:36:45.701 --> 01:36:48.310
<v Speaker 3>this is when they created twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they didn't think of it?</v>

1857
01:36:48.311 --> 01:36:49.144
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be some voice of </v>

1858
01:36:50.290 --> 01:36:53.380
<v Speaker 3>distribution of information that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>unprecedenteD worldwide,</v>

1859
01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.090
<v Speaker 3>but that's what it is.</v>

1860
01:36:55.190 --> 01:36:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1861
01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:57.373
<v Speaker 2>they didn't expect no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't expect it to work exactly </v>

1862
01:36:59.871 --> 01:37:00.704
<v Speaker 2>the way it worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the antitrust law has from the </v>

1863
01:37:02.781 --> 01:37:03.614
<v Speaker 2>beginning had standards that should have</v>
<v Speaker 2>said we need to step in and certain </v>

1864
01:37:05.811 --> 01:37:06.890
<v Speaker 2>places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

1865
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:07.783
<v Speaker 2>in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook is facing a pretty powerful </v>

1866
01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 2>competitive threat from instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1867
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:19.820
<v Speaker 2>the question is what they're gonna do </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's cooler to be instagram.</v>

1868
01:37:19.821 --> 01:37:20.654
<v Speaker 2>It's kids are using it much with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth rate is much faster in an </v>

1869
01:37:24.831 --> 01:37:27.260
<v Speaker 2>ordinary competitive market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they would do is they would build a</v>

1870
01:37:27.261 --> 01:37:30.020
<v Speaker 2>better product to compete with </v>
<v Speaker 2>instagram.</v>

1871
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:31.423
<v Speaker 2>Their response was to write a check for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a billion dollars and they bought </v>

1872
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:37.070
<v Speaker 2>instagram and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they've bought a whole bunch of.</v>

1873
01:37:37.071 --> 01:37:38.810
<v Speaker 2>Other companies clearly have whatsapp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

1874
01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:43.820
<v Speaker 2>was a very important competitor in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People believe they're really secure way</v>

1875
01:37:44.271 --> 01:37:47.760
<v Speaker 2>to communicate to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They by boston dynamics to have that.</v>

1876
01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:49.070
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>

1877
01:37:49.570 --> 01:37:50.403
<v Speaker 2>There's a wikipedia page that has like </v>
<v Speaker 2>endless list of companies that they've </v>

1878
01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.680
<v Speaker 2>bought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're buying robots.</v>

1879
01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

1880
01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:01.920
<v Speaker 2>Funnel if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is antitrust law in any of</v>

1881
01:38:02.761 --> 01:38:03.594
<v Speaker 2>these moments should have in </v>
<v Speaker 2>historically would have stepped in and </v>

1882
01:38:06.451 --> 01:38:07.320
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

1883
01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:08.393
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't buy your way into complete </v>

1884
01:38:10.741 --> 01:38:11.574
<v Speaker 2>dominance of these markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the biggest changes </v>

1885
01:38:15.511 --> 01:38:16.344
<v Speaker 2>that's happened in the last 20 years is </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the antitrust department has Just </v>

1886
01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.440
<v Speaker 2>shot up its doors and just stopped doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>its work.</v>

1887
01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:23.453
<v Speaker 2>So if we had a more Competitive internet</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where companies had to </v>

1888
01:38:30.241 --> 01:38:34.110
<v Speaker 2>compete against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have companies that try to compete</v>

1889
01:38:34.111 --> 01:38:34.944
<v Speaker 2>by protecting your privacy differently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by refusing to sell your information </v>

1890
01:38:37.891 --> 01:38:40.230
<v Speaker 2>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have lots of pressure on companies</v>

1891
01:38:40.231 --> 01:38:41.064
<v Speaker 2>like facebook to behave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not because idiot senators who don't </v>

1892
01:38:43.981 --> 01:38:46.560
<v Speaker 2>know how facebook works or calling them </v>
<v Speaker 2>before hearings,</v>

1893
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.753
<v Speaker 2>but because the market itself is </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating the competition that drives </v>

1894
01:38:50.431 --> 01:38:53.340
<v Speaker 2>them to behave in a way that actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>conforms with what consumers want.</v>

1895
01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:54.533
<v Speaker 2>So I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are real questions and important </v>

1896
01:38:57.031 --> 01:38:57.864
<v Speaker 2>questions to figure out are they biasing</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one way or the other and if they're </v>

1897
01:39:00.451 --> 01:39:03.510
<v Speaker 2>biasing systematically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a really important problem,</v>

1898
01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:07.800
<v Speaker 2>but the solution to that problem might </v>
<v Speaker 2>not be more government regulation.</v>

1899
01:39:08.040 --> 01:39:08.873
<v Speaker 2>The solution to that problem might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments making sure we have the </v>

1900
01:39:11.041 --> 01:39:11.874
<v Speaker 2>right kind of competition going on here </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that they can't get away with </v>

1901
01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:15.894
<v Speaker 2>behaving</v>

1902
01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.080
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would be that right?</v>

1903
01:39:17.081 --> 01:39:17.914
<v Speaker 3>Comic effect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google bought it and they actually sold </v>

1904
01:39:20.501 --> 01:39:21.860
<v Speaker 3>it last year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1905
01:39:22.510 --> 01:39:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably sold to the russians,</v>

1906
01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.720
<v Speaker 3>the Japanese,</v>
<v Speaker 3>japanese.</v>

1907
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:32.050
<v Speaker 3>These like what would be the right kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of competition?</v>

1908
01:39:32.051 --> 01:39:34.000
<v Speaker 3>It would have to be something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>balances it out,</v>

1909
01:39:34.001 --> 01:39:34.834
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some sort of a right wing social </v>

1910
01:39:36.551 --> 01:39:37.384
<v Speaker 3>media platform,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those tend to get infested with </v>

1911
01:39:40.211 --> 01:39:44.230
<v Speaker 3>trolls and four chan type people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then as soon as you say,</v>

1912
01:39:44.410 --> 01:39:46.300
<v Speaker 3>we're not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have any regulation.</v>

1913
01:39:46.420 --> 01:39:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I Mean the idea would be right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say,</v>

1914
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:51.190
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>google and facebook,</v>

1915
01:39:51.191 --> 01:39:53.110
<v Speaker 3>they are so progressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They lean left,</v>

1916
01:39:53.111 --> 01:39:57.970
<v Speaker 3>they suppress conservative voices and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't believe in freedom of speech,</v>

1917
01:39:57.971 --> 01:39:58.804
<v Speaker 3>so we're going to create a right wing </v>
<v Speaker 3>platform that allows freedom of speech </v>

1918
01:40:02.831 --> 01:40:03.664
<v Speaker 3>and doesn't suppress conservative voices</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know what happens to those </v>

1919
01:40:06.161 --> 01:40:06.994
<v Speaker 3>things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get infested by four chan people </v>

1920
01:40:09.941 --> 01:40:13.090
<v Speaker 3>and the pepe the frog people and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>start saying racist things.</v>

1921
01:40:13.210 --> 01:40:14.860
<v Speaker 3>If I could say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say anything,</v>

1922
01:40:15.190 --> 01:40:19.330
<v Speaker 3>anything means anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's a real problem in today's day</v>

1923
01:40:19.331 --> 01:40:20.164
<v Speaker 3>and age because there's a lot of bored </v>
<v Speaker 3>people out there and they get excited </v>

1924
01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:23.583
<v Speaker 3>about a platform where they can say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that they know is completely </v>

1925
01:40:27.161 --> 01:40:30.760
<v Speaker 3>outrageous under an anonymous screen </v>
<v Speaker 3>name and people think,</v>

1926
01:40:30.761 --> 01:40:31.594
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is indicative of a person's actual </v>

1927
01:40:32.771 --> 01:40:35.140
<v Speaker 3>real beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

1928
01:40:35.290 --> 01:40:36.123
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's board people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to fuck with people and they're </v>

1929
01:40:38.771 --> 01:40:39.604
<v Speaker 3>trying to get a rise out of folks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know that if they write a bunch of </v>

1930
01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:43.213
<v Speaker 3>words and heil hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's going to get a reaction and </v>

1931
01:40:46.091 --> 01:40:48.310
<v Speaker 3>then they'll check it every couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes to see what kind of,</v>

1932
01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.110
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at all these people getting mad.</v>

1933
01:40:50.111 --> 01:40:52.510
<v Speaker 3>Ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what happens.</v>

1934
01:40:52.630 --> 01:40:53.463
<v Speaker 3>So incredibly progressive tea tends to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you think of someone as being </v>

1935
01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:02.080
<v Speaker 3>progressive or be having a progressive </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice,</v>

1936
01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.570
<v Speaker 3>you tend to think of being inclusive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1937
01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:05.913
<v Speaker 3>not supporting homophobia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being open to all sorts of different </v>

1938
01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:13.930
<v Speaker 3>marginalized groups rights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you think of conservative,</v>

1939
01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:14.973
<v Speaker 3>you open the door for a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are rejected by these progressive </v>

1940
01:41:19.751 --> 01:41:23.200
<v Speaker 3>groups and they Might not necessarily be</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservative,</v>

1941
01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:26.950
<v Speaker 3>but they are not welcome in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>progressive spaces.</v>

1942
01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:29.060
<v Speaker 3>So they come out to these new places and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1943
01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.330
<v Speaker 3>it turns into a dumpster fire.</v>

1944
01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:33.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

1945
01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:36.590
<v Speaker 2>the stoRy you just described is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story of cable television.</v>

1946
01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Cable television is that at a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>point people like robert roger ailes and</v>

1947
01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:46.850
<v Speaker 2>murdoch's decided that we didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough conservative media out there.</v>

1948
01:41:47.300 --> 01:41:50.480
<v Speaker 2>And so they funded not just magazines </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the new republic,</v>

1949
01:41:50.481 --> 01:41:53.700
<v Speaker 2>but they funded the beginning of cable </v>
<v Speaker 2>television and um,</v>

1950
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:54.743
<v Speaker 2>and that created this bifurcation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>media with cable television and one </v>

1951
01:42:00.201 --> 01:42:02.150
<v Speaker 2>could make these observations about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1952
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:03.103
<v Speaker 2>this is what you'll have done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clare's book is all about like what the </v>

1953
01:42:04.791 --> 01:42:05.624
<v Speaker 2>nature of truth is on cable television </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the right is different from what it </v>

1954
01:42:08.871 --> 01:42:09.704
<v Speaker 2>is on the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's all fair and I don't </v>

1955
01:42:13.071 --> 01:42:13.904
<v Speaker 2>think anybody has a clear sense of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right answer looks like in this </v>

1956
01:42:17.901 --> 01:42:18.800
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1957
01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.480
<v Speaker 2>the reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1958
01:42:20.481 --> 01:42:23.000
<v Speaker 2>facebook is a technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here,</v>

1959
01:42:23.090 --> 01:42:24.890
<v Speaker 2>facebook friends are going to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate me for this,</v>

1960
01:42:24.891 --> 01:42:25.724
<v Speaker 2>but here facebook is a technology to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploit insecurity for the purpose of </v>

1961
01:42:29.901 --> 01:42:31.730
<v Speaker 2>selling ads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it does.</v>

1962
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:35.090
<v Speaker 2>What it does is make you feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've checked and you're like,</v>

1963
01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:38.270
<v Speaker 2>why didn't she like that photograph or </v>
<v Speaker 2>why isn't he friended me?</v>

1964
01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:39.493
<v Speaker 2>And so you constantly engage because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly trying to feed this </v>

1965
01:42:45.260 --> 01:42:50.210
<v Speaker 2>feedback and that is exploiting tristan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tristan harris.</v>

1966
01:42:50.211 --> 01:42:53.540
<v Speaker 2>HiS work Is really a powerful here is </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploiting your insecurity.</v>

1967
01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:54.633
<v Speaker 3>Is that really what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I've always thought about it as </v>

1968
01:42:55.971 --> 01:42:56.804
<v Speaker 3>being a fast food version of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nutrients that we're missing in an </v>

1969
01:43:00.201 --> 01:43:01.430
<v Speaker 3>actual real community.</v>

1970
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:02.263
<v Speaker 2>That's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the right way to think </v>

1971
01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:04.744
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just in the same way that fast food </v>

1972
01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:07.293
<v Speaker 2>companies figure out how to exploit the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain chemistry that makes it so that </v>

1973
01:43:11.591 --> 01:43:13.310
<v Speaker 2>you eat chicken wings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1974
01:43:13.570 --> 01:43:17.020
<v Speaker 2>barbecue chicken wings because they know</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's going to feed that kind of</v>

1975
01:43:17.021 --> 01:43:19.240
<v Speaker 2>addiction and just like gaming </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

1976
01:43:19.660 --> 01:43:23.740
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to tweak the game so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd know how to get the addiction out</v>

1977
01:43:23.741 --> 01:43:24.574
<v Speaker 2>of your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This company is really great at getting </v>

1978
01:43:28.631 --> 01:43:29.464
<v Speaker 2>you to like turnover as much as you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>to them to builD you into this quote </v>

1979
01:43:33.460 --> 01:43:35.230
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are they doing that?</v>

1980
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:36.423
<v Speaker 2>Not because mark zuckerberg has come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of freaky guy who wants to </v>

1981
01:43:38.711 --> 01:43:39.544
<v Speaker 2>know your secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because the more you turn over to </v>

1982
01:43:41.711 --> 01:43:42.544
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the better their ads are in feeding you </v>

1983
01:43:45.491 --> 01:43:46.324
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is a technology for the purpose </v>

1984
01:43:48.761 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 2>of engendering advertising and so that</v>

1985
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.810
<v Speaker 1>advertising gets really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

1986
01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:54.831
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1987
01:43:54.831 --> 01:43:57.620
<v Speaker 1>you could say that facebook is tilted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

1988
01:43:57.621 --> 01:43:58.454
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is there is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary amount of exploitation of </v>

1989
01:44:01.191 --> 01:44:04.550
<v Speaker 1>the advertising inside of facebook to </v>
<v Speaker 1>feed information to the right.</v>

1990
01:44:04.551 --> 01:44:06.210
<v Speaker 1>In this last election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as much,</v>

1991
01:44:06.570 --> 01:44:08.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm Kathleen Hall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jayman says book about this.</v>

1992
01:44:08.811 --> 01:44:09.644
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite amazing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>documenting and that's because it's </v>

1993
01:44:13.461 --> 01:44:14.294
<v Speaker 1>gotten really good at being able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>segment markets on the basis of what </v>

1994
01:44:16.701 --> 01:44:18.440
<v Speaker 1>people know or care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1995
01:44:18.441 --> 01:44:21.020
<v Speaker 1>not because anybody planned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wrote jew hater,</v>

1996
01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:23.570
<v Speaker 1>but because the ai is smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that out,</v>

1997
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.823
<v Speaker 1>and so when you build this technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is driven to the purpose of making </v>

1998
01:44:29.301 --> 01:44:30.134
<v Speaker 1>it easier to sell ads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you produced this world that has no </v>

1999
01:44:34.731 --> 01:44:37.880
<v Speaker 1>necessary connection to figure people </v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out what the truth is.</v>

2000
01:44:37.881 --> 01:44:39.110
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of cable television.</v>

2001
01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:42.860
<v Speaker 1>Cable television is about building </v>
<v Speaker 1>really loyal community,</v>

2002
01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:44.990
<v Speaker 1>building the tribal sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

2003
01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:48.140
<v Speaker 1>If telling the truth did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would tell the truth.</v>

2004
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:51.620
<v Speaker 1>If not telling the truth does that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will not tell the truth.</v>

2005
01:44:51.860 --> 01:44:54.410
<v Speaker 1>The question is not whether you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth or not.</v>

2006
01:44:54.411 --> 01:44:57.170
<v Speaker 1>The question is what builds the </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising base.</v>

2007
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:58.363
<v Speaker 1>And so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this reality that we have these </v>

2008
01:45:00.111 --> 01:45:03.040
<v Speaker 1>platforms that are ad driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2009
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:08.390
<v Speaker 1>distort or constructs drives that </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform to develop in certain ways.</v>

2010
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:10.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think it's important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

2011
01:45:10.641 --> 01:45:11.474
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we could create a competitive </v>

2012
01:45:12.411 --> 01:45:13.244
<v Speaker 1>environment where there were different </v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms available once that we're not </v>

2013
01:45:15.891 --> 01:45:19.630
<v Speaker 1>focused on driving ads and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that again,</v>

2014
01:45:19.730 --> 01:45:23.540
<v Speaker 1>I think they fund those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the reason why something like</v>

2015
01:45:23.541 --> 01:45:26.510
<v Speaker 1>google or facebook has gotten so big is </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of so much money behind it?</v>

2016
01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:27.373
<v Speaker 1>Well two things because they've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to get so big and because so </v>

2017
01:45:29.721 --> 01:45:31.130
<v Speaker 1>much money behind it stopped them.</v>

2018
01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:33.370
<v Speaker 1>The antitrust departments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2019
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:35.000
<v Speaker 1>antitrust department would step in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2020
01:45:35.001 --> 01:45:36.830
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become too successful.</v>

2021
01:45:36.890 --> 01:45:39.770
<v Speaker 1>The way you're buying up competitors is </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing to us.</v>

2022
01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

2023
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:42.350
<v Speaker 1>the thing of the difference in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>

2024
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:44.810
<v Speaker 1>you've become so successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one sentence.</v>

2025
01:45:44.900 --> 01:45:45.733
<v Speaker 1>And what we want to do in America is </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged companies to become </v>

2026
01:45:47.631 --> 01:45:49.010
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in,</v>

2027
01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:49.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovators and markets working that's </v>

2028
01:45:51.381 --> 01:45:52.214
<v Speaker 1>really great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've bought your competitor is a </v>

2029
01:45:54.981 --> 01:45:55.814
<v Speaker 1>separate statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you have a bunch of money because </v>

2030
01:45:57.441 --> 01:46:00.410
<v Speaker 1>the stock is so valuable because people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think you're the future of money,</v>

2031
01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:05.150
<v Speaker 1>but then you turn and use that money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy a competitor's.</v>

2032
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:06.310
<v Speaker 1>What do you put in up jamie?</v>

2033
01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.560
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the total number of they've spent</v>

2034
01:46:08.590 --> 01:46:09.820
<v Speaker 3>in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2035
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:12.250
<v Speaker 3>I think it was seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saw the company as they bought.</v>

2036
01:46:12.370 --> 01:46:13.181
<v Speaker 3>Scroll back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2037
01:46:13.181 --> 01:46:15.880
<v Speaker 3>don't move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Total cost of acquisitions.</v>

2038
01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:18.650
<v Speaker 3>What does that $23,000,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Billion,</v>

2039
01:46:18.710 --> 01:46:20.290
<v Speaker 3>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Twenty $3,000,000,000</v>

2040
01:46:20.291 --> 01:46:24.220
<v Speaker 3>more than the gross domestic product of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Fiji.</v>

2041
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Zimbabwe and mild dbs combined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>19 billion of that was for that one.</v>

2042
01:46:28.330 --> 01:46:29.840
<v Speaker 3>What's app?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2043
01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:31.690
<v Speaker 3>19 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2044
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2045
01:46:34.780 --> 01:46:35.613
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is when you're talking </v>

2046
01:46:36.941 --> 01:46:37.774
<v Speaker 1>about acquisitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not necessarily talking about </v>

2047
01:46:39.641 --> 01:46:41.500
<v Speaker 1>companies that are succeeding because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so good.</v>

2048
01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

2049
01:46:43.331 --> 01:46:45.460
<v Speaker 1>when you say what are the alternatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to look like?</v>

2050
01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:48.340
<v Speaker 1>It's a really hard question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have some of it in real space.</v>

2051
01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.240
<v Speaker 1>Like we understand</v>

2052
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:54.030
<v Speaker 2>npr has a different set of incentives </v>
<v Speaker 2>from fox news.</v>

2053
01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.560
<v Speaker 2>We understand podcasts have a different </v>
<v Speaker 2>set of incentives from youtube videos,</v>

2054
01:46:58.710 --> 01:46:59.543
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do videos of a different kind of </v>

2055
01:47:01.111 --> 01:47:03.540
<v Speaker 2>constraint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you did a three hour youtube video,</v>

2056
01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:05.813
<v Speaker 2>you would not live in the same way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to live in the context of </v>

2057
01:47:08.731 --> 01:47:11.030
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we do do a three hour youtube video,</v>

2058
01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:11.873
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't get the success that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>gets because it's a three hour youtube </v>

2059
01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:15.804
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because people are committed to </v>

2060
01:47:16.801 --> 01:47:19.200
<v Speaker 2>your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know these guys like a carry it</v>

2061
01:47:19.201 --> 01:47:20.034
<v Speaker 2>around and like when you get to a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it sounds like it's going to be </v>

2062
01:47:22.261 --> 01:47:24.780
<v Speaker 2>interesting to see what's on the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they flip up the video.</v>

2063
01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:25.943
<v Speaker 2>But.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know the average successful </v>

2064
01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:30.630
<v Speaker 2>youtube video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you do a political youtube video,</v>

2065
01:47:30.631 --> 01:47:32.490
<v Speaker 2>you're told you can't be more than two </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a half minutes.</v>

2066
01:47:32.520 --> 01:47:36.120
<v Speaker 2>Then you've lost people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the point is the environments.</v>

2067
01:47:36.350 --> 01:47:37.880
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily think that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>correct.</v>

2068
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:39.163
<v Speaker 3>Jordan peterson is doing a lot of really</v>
<v Speaker 3>long youtube videos that are very </v>

2069
01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:42.830
<v Speaker 3>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't hurt as podcasts.</v>

2070
01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.273
<v Speaker 3>There's a hunger right now for unedited </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought and not edited in under an </v>

2071
01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:52.453
<v Speaker 3>uncensored in terms of language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in terms of no one influencing what </v>

2072
01:47:55.581 --> 01:47:56.414
<v Speaker 3>you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you decided to do a podcast or a </v>

2073
01:47:58.611 --> 01:47:59.444
<v Speaker 3>thing on youtube and no one was leaning </v>
<v Speaker 3>over your shoulder with an agenda or a </v>

2074
01:48:03.711 --> 01:48:04.544
<v Speaker 3>guideline to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real hunger for that because </v>

2075
01:48:06.861 --> 01:48:11.810
<v Speaker 3>people feel like what you've described </v>
<v Speaker 3>about facebook and cable news,</v>

2076
01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:13.460
<v Speaker 3>that they're essentially just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sell you things,</v>

2077
01:48:13.461 --> 01:48:16.100
<v Speaker 3>keep you on the hook so they can profit </v>
<v Speaker 3>from you.</v>

2078
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:18.920
<v Speaker 3>There's a real hunger for someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>not doing that.</v>

2079
01:48:18.980 --> 01:48:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2080
01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:24.260
<v Speaker 3>This is why I feel like there's got to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a market for news in that regard.</v>

2081
01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Like an actual unbiased,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uncensored,</v>

2082
01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:30.980
<v Speaker 3>raw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truly objective centrist news station.</v>

2083
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:33.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2084
01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:34.333
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the slow democracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement that podcast feeds because the </v>

2085
01:48:38.541 --> 01:48:39.374
<v Speaker 2>reality is if you had a simple way to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching in every second of your two </v>

2086
01:48:46.281 --> 01:48:47.720
<v Speaker 2>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three hour podcasts,</v>

2087
01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:52.700
<v Speaker 2>what was working and what was not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be really hard for you to resist.</v>

2088
01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.860
<v Speaker 2>I would resist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2089
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:55.820
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't pay attention to the thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a second car to you.</v>

2090
01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.730
<v Speaker 3>I've already been faced with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2091
01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:59.400
<v Speaker 3>People have said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2092
01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:02.110
<v Speaker 3>well this is when people start tuning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Throw that away.</v>

2093
01:49:02.170 --> 01:49:03.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2094
01:49:03.311 --> 01:49:04.144
<v Speaker 2>I know friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chris hayes will tell you about life on </v>

2095
01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:10.320
<v Speaker 2>msnbc where it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

2096
01:49:10.330 --> 01:49:12.220
<v Speaker 2>that's because of advertiser dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2097
01:49:12.221 --> 01:49:13.054
<v Speaker 2>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point is the way to this is my whole </v>

2098
01:49:15.371 --> 01:49:16.204
<v Speaker 2>point about this platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this platform is in advertising driven </v>

2099
01:49:18.401 --> 01:49:19.320
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2100
01:49:19.450 --> 01:49:20.283
<v Speaker 2>That fact steers it in a certain way and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saying we need to build alternative </v>

2101
01:49:24.761 --> 01:49:25.594
<v Speaker 2>platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was what you're building and the </v>

2102
01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:27.593
<v Speaker 2>in the pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like advertising is not </v>

2103
01:49:28.421 --> 01:49:29.254
<v Speaker 2>important to your stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you start with talking about </v>

2104
01:49:32.261 --> 01:49:34.060
<v Speaker 2>certain products that help sponsor what </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing.</v>

2105
01:49:34.061 --> 01:49:36.490
<v Speaker 2>So it's not anti market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all for market.</v>

2106
01:49:36.491 --> 01:49:37.324
<v Speaker 2>But the point is it allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop the content in a way that's not </v>

2107
01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:42.033
<v Speaker 2>micromanaged by the advertising dollar </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the are the market incentive and </v>

2108
01:49:46.151 --> 01:49:47.980
<v Speaker 2>that's critically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2109
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.813
<v Speaker 3>also other people's incentive to get you</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do things in a way that they will </v>

2110
01:49:52.661 --> 01:49:56.440
<v Speaker 3>feel they feel will be more profitable </v>
<v Speaker 3>so that everybody gains.</v>

2111
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:58.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have those other people.</v>

2112
01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:00.190
<v Speaker 3>So there's no one else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I,</v>

2113
01:50:00.191 --> 01:50:02.050
<v Speaker 3>but if I've done television shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>

2114
01:50:02.051 --> 01:50:02.884
<v Speaker 3>when you do television shows before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>will have meetings with producers and </v>

2115
01:50:05.981 --> 01:50:09.250
<v Speaker 3>they will have notes and they will tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>you that this is hurting our bottom line</v>

2116
01:50:09.251 --> 01:50:13.390
<v Speaker 3>and this is not good for that or we have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to emphasize more of this or the network</v>

2117
01:50:13.391 --> 01:50:14.224
<v Speaker 3>wants that and it's really just about </v>
<v Speaker 3>accentuating your ability to make more </v>

2118
01:50:17.561 --> 01:50:18.394
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2119
01:50:18.490 --> 01:50:19.323
<v Speaker 3>Which is why we have to build these </v>
<v Speaker 3>alternatives that can compete with the </v>

2120
01:50:22.781 --> 01:50:24.850
<v Speaker 3>advertising driven platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2121
01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:29.770
<v Speaker 3>if you could get a really entertaining </v>
<v Speaker 3>news show on youtube or I mean,</v>

2122
01:50:29.771 --> 01:50:32.310
<v Speaker 3>I guess the young turks sorta tried </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that,</v>

2123
01:50:32.680 --> 01:50:36.910
<v Speaker 3>but they leaned so hard left a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they attract an extraordinary number</v>

2124
01:50:36.911 --> 01:50:37.960
<v Speaker 3>of people and that's good.</v>

2125
01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2126
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 3>we have this image of like new shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a version of walter cronkite.</v>

2127
01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you know,</v>

2128
01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:50.560
<v Speaker 3>the cupbearer report is a new show or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

2129
01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:51.394
<v Speaker 3>Who's someone is mocking it as they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>delivering you the input that they're </v>

2130
01:50:53.051 --> 01:50:56.020
<v Speaker 3>giving you the information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who's objective.</v>

2131
01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.610
<v Speaker 3>I would like someone who's really </v>
<v Speaker 3>objective,</v>

2132
01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:58.713
<v Speaker 3>who talks about the negative </v>
<v Speaker 3>applications of whatever law or bill </v>

2133
01:51:01.661 --> 01:51:04.690
<v Speaker 3>it's being discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what would be bad for everyone,</v>

2134
01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:07.810
<v Speaker 3>what would be good for democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 3>republicans,</v>

2135
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:09.250
<v Speaker 3>poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rich people.</v>

2136
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:10.263
<v Speaker 3>You don't get that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no version of that available </v>

2137
01:51:12.341 --> 01:51:13.174
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>every version leans towards whatever </v>

2138
01:51:15.431 --> 01:51:18.670
<v Speaker 3>platform they're on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's fox news or msnbc.</v>

2139
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:22.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think not for want of trying.</v>

2140
01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:25.120
<v Speaker 3>I just think the world doesn't support </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2141
01:51:25.610 --> 01:51:26.443
<v Speaker 3>but the world doesn't support it because</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people are so tribal because </v>

2142
01:51:30.311 --> 01:51:31.144
<v Speaker 3>they want to be either on the fox news </v>
<v Speaker 3>camp or they want to be in the msnbc </v>

2143
01:51:34.361 --> 01:51:35.194
<v Speaker 3>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really feel like there's a lot of </v>

2144
01:51:37.211 --> 01:51:41.400
<v Speaker 3>people that just aren't being </v>
<v Speaker 3>represented and folks like me who just.</v>

2145
01:51:41.410 --> 01:51:43.120
<v Speaker 3>I want to know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is happening?</v>

2146
01:51:43.150 --> 01:51:45.040
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is this the Case?</v>

2147
01:51:45.220 --> 01:51:46.053
<v Speaker 3>Why is this leaning in this direction?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the real motivation behind this </v>

2148
01:51:49.841 --> 01:51:50.674
<v Speaker 3>bill?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the real motivation behind these </v>

2149
01:51:52.001 --> 01:51:52.834
<v Speaker 3>actions?</v>

2150
01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:53.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2151
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:55.723
<v Speaker 2>and the question is whether you're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get it from a single person who </v>

2152
01:51:58.781 --> 01:51:59.614
<v Speaker 2>purports to be quote objective or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're going to get it from </v>

2153
01:52:02.501 --> 01:52:05.770
<v Speaker 2>three or four people like reading across</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different perspectives.</v>

2154
01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:08.710
<v Speaker 2>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was obsessed with the soviet union and</v>

2155
01:52:08.711 --> 01:52:12.490
<v Speaker 2>in 1982 I went to the soviet union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2156
01:52:12.940 --> 01:52:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I guess I was 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just turned 21 and,</v>

2157
01:52:17.370 --> 01:52:19.420
<v Speaker 2>and I was hitchhiking through eastern </v>
<v Speaker 2>europe.</v>

2158
01:52:19.421 --> 01:52:20.254
<v Speaker 2>And then I went through the soviet union</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was on a train from leningrad to </v>

2159
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:27.160
<v Speaker 2>moscow and a sitting next to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor.</v>

2160
01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:29.950
<v Speaker 2>I always seem to be followed by people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who spoke english.</v>

2161
01:52:29.951 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 2>But this guy spoke english and he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

2162
01:52:31.811 --> 01:52:32.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2163
01:52:32.951 --> 01:52:36.910
<v Speaker 2>we have a better system of free speech </v>
<v Speaker 2>and soviet union than you do in America.</v>

2164
01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:38.260
<v Speaker 2>How dare he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh?</v>

2165
01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:40.330
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whaT the hell could that possibly mean?</v>

2166
01:52:41.110 --> 01:52:41.681
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2167
01:52:41.681 --> 01:52:44.620
<v Speaker 2>when you wake up in the mornings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2168
01:52:44.621 --> 01:52:45.141
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2169
01:52:45.141 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 2>when you wake up in the morning,</v>

2170
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.863
<v Speaker 1>you read the New York times or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington post or the wall street </v>

2171
01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:51.380
<v Speaker 1>journal and you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2172
01:52:51.381 --> 01:52:55.820
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know when we read our newspapers,</v>

2173
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:56.683
<v Speaker 1>everybody's lying to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to read seven or eight </v>

2174
01:52:59.091 --> 01:52:59.924
<v Speaker 1>newspapers and triangulate on the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes us a more critical free </v>

2175
01:53:05.181 --> 01:53:08.570
<v Speaker 1>speech society that America is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2176
01:53:08.571 --> 01:53:10.300
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of funny at the time because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2177
01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:13.550
<v Speaker 1>you realize they didn't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a kernel of truth to that.</v>

2178
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:14.623
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when my dad gets an email that says </v>

2179
01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:19.213
<v Speaker 1>barack obama's a muslim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes from the time when you just </v>

2180
01:53:22.821 --> 01:53:25.070
<v Speaker 1>believe what's printed even though it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not printed,</v>

2181
01:53:25.071 --> 01:53:27.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just an email.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he just kind of like,</v>

2182
01:53:27.411 --> 01:53:29.480
<v Speaker 1>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of muslim.</v>

2183
01:53:29.850 --> 01:53:30.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2184
01:53:30.981 --> 01:53:34.160
<v Speaker 1>my kid gets an email that says barack </v>
<v Speaker 1>obama is a muslim.</v>

2185
01:53:34.160 --> 01:53:34.940
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2186
01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:35.773
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2187
01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:37.880
<v Speaker 1>what else mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he's going to be like,</v>

2188
01:53:37.881 --> 01:53:40.010
<v Speaker 1>yo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to see different views.</v>

2189
01:53:40.011 --> 01:53:43.160
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that in some sense we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a culture,</v>

2190
01:53:43.161 --> 01:53:45.160
<v Speaker 1>especially among our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2191
01:53:45.300 --> 01:53:49.010
<v Speaker 1>or at least one hopes where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that everything is partial.</v>

2192
01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you gotta you gotta do a lot of work</v>

2193
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:55.250
<v Speaker 1>to Poland to knit it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the end that might be a better.</v>

2194
01:53:55.780 --> 01:53:56.613
<v Speaker 1>I might be a better ecology for </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing democracy and truth than one </v>

2195
01:54:00.591 --> 01:54:01.161
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2196
01:54:01.161 --> 01:54:05.510
<v Speaker 1>you've got to trust the source to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective in this case.</v>

2197
01:54:05.870 --> 01:54:08.390
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2198
01:54:08.391 --> 01:54:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I do definitely agree that young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>are more skeptical and more aware of the</v>

2199
01:54:12.831 --> 01:54:15.980
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of fuckery today than ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

2200
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Here's a funny story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael sherman,</v>

2201
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:20.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>michael shermer,</v>

2202
01:54:20.661 --> 01:54:22.430
<v Speaker 1>who is a professional skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2203
01:54:22.730 --> 01:54:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I get a dm from him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

2204
01:54:25.690 --> 01:54:29.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a story about you on bc.</v>

2205
01:54:29.490 --> 01:54:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2206
01:54:31.371 --> 01:54:34.790
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the british bbc is a story about</v>

2207
01:54:34.791 --> 01:54:35.624
<v Speaker 1>you on bbc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to log into your twitter to </v>

2208
01:54:38.721 --> 01:54:40.610
<v Speaker 1>read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I look at that.</v>

2209
01:54:40.611 --> 01:54:42.440
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of bullshit?</v>

2210
01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:43.730
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you get hacked?</v>

2211
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:45.900
<v Speaker 1>so I sent him a message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2212
01:54:45.901 --> 01:54:47.030
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get hacked.</v>

2213
01:54:47.300 --> 01:54:50.480
<v Speaker 1>They send him the message and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2214
01:54:50.481 --> 01:54:52.620
<v Speaker 1>There's a story about me and he logged </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

2215
01:54:52.621 --> 01:54:54.860
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking professional skeptic.</v>

2216
01:54:54.861 --> 01:54:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got him.</v>

2217
01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:57.920
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he's older now.</v>

2218
01:54:58.150 --> 01:54:58.850
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2219
01:54:58.850 --> 01:55:02.270
<v Speaker 1>I think guys that didn't grow up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2220
01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.760
<v Speaker 1>they don't or they don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricksters.</v>

2221
01:55:05.150 --> 01:55:06.290
<v Speaker 1>They don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2222
01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:08.240
<v Speaker 1>the ways of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a nightmare for him.</v>

2223
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.193
<v Speaker 1>He'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean his whole system was screwed up </v>

2224
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:13.810
<v Speaker 1>and he had a j.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time it would make,</v>

2225
01:55:14.050 --> 01:55:15.500
<v Speaker 1>make a tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would get deleted.</v>

2226
01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Like it was really bad and I will email </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and go,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is the way we live.</v>

2230
01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:24.313
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just you grow up with one system </v>

2231
01:55:26.241 --> 01:55:28.400

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

2237
01:55:42.710 --> 01:55:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean this is amazing,</v>

<v Speaker 3>My whole family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They left a message.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's very sad.</v>

2249
01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:16.763
<v Speaker 3>It's very sad because a lot of them are </v>
<v Speaker 3>lonely and they don't have a lot of </v>

2250
01:56:20.671 --> 01:56:21.504
<v Speaker 3>companionship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they get these messages and they </v>

<v Speaker 3>don't know who to turn to to explain it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to</v>

<v Speaker 1>so is there a reason to be hopeful here?</v>

2255
01:56:29.391 --> 01:56:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger kids.</v>

2256
01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:32.873
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that makes me really </v>

2257
01:56:34.611 --> 01:56:37.490
<v Speaker 1>hopeful is places like reddit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so which forms are you going?</v>

2259
01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:44.980
<v Speaker 3>I know there's some really bad stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some of them are</v>

2260
01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.570
<v Speaker 1>great though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many of them are great.</v>

2261
01:56:46.571 --> 01:56:47.404
<v Speaker 1>But the point is what the greatness can </v>
<v Speaker 1>inheres in there demonstrating </v>

2262
01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:54.160
<v Speaker 1>incredible talents out there in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that,</v>

2263
01:56:54.161 --> 01:56:56.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 seventies just would have been</v>

2264
01:56:56.471 --> 01:56:57.304
<v Speaker 1>invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you kind of looked at the world in </v>

2265
01:56:58.331 --> 01:56:59.164
<v Speaker 1>the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I remember the 19 seventies you </v>

2266
01:57:00.731 --> 01:57:02.380
<v Speaker 1>kind of thought they were great people </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the top,</v>

2267
01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:04.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all in television and,</v>

2268
01:57:05.170 --> 01:57:09.430
<v Speaker 1>and everybody else was kind of a troll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what red hat does every day,</v>

2269
01:57:09.450 --> 01:57:09.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2270
01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm obsessed with certain of these feats</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjuster.</v>

2271
01:57:12.581 --> 01:57:13.480
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2272
01:57:13.481 --> 01:57:15.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you read them like,</v>

2273
01:57:15.010 --> 01:57:18.430
<v Speaker 1>here's just some joe schmo out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's taken a bunch of data and data is</v>

2274
01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:19.181
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2275
01:57:19.181 --> 01:57:22.090
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated something amazing by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way he's built it.</v>

2276
01:57:22.570 --> 01:57:27.310
<v Speaker 1>And yoU get the sense that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>filled with these incredibly talented,</v>

2277
01:57:27.311 --> 01:57:29.930
<v Speaker 1>smart people everywhere who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2278
01:57:29.950 --> 01:57:30.783
<v Speaker 1>many of them just have too much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is they're out there </v>

2279
01:57:33.221 --> 01:57:36.250
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you ask why should we be hopeful?</v>

2280
01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:39.190
<v Speaker 1>It's that we develop these critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes.</v>

2281
01:57:39.191 --> 01:57:40.024
<v Speaker 1>We have this ability to think across.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the army is filled with so many </v>

2282
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:47.530
<v Speaker 1>incredibly talented people and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet surfaces it.</v>

2283
01:57:47.531 --> 01:57:50.980
<v Speaker 1>It makes it possible for us to at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach them.</v>

2284
01:57:51.040 --> 01:57:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the question is can we use this</v>

2285
01:57:54.161 --> 01:57:54.994
<v Speaker 1>power leverage is power and actually do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something with the forces of evil that </v>

2286
01:57:58.660 --> 01:57:59.380
<v Speaker 1>now control.</v>

2287
01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:03.430
<v Speaker 3>I had an interesting moment last night </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the ice house comedy club where there</v>

2288
01:58:03.431 --> 01:58:04.264
<v Speaker 3>was a drunk couple in the front row that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking really loud and they were </v>

2289
01:58:06.701 --> 01:58:07.534
<v Speaker 3>annoying all the people around them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were kind of chime in and heckling </v>

2290
01:58:10.181 --> 01:58:11.014
<v Speaker 3>and raising their hands and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 3>they got kicked out and it was pretty </v>

2291
01:58:15.071 --> 01:58:16.900
<v Speaker 3>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody was having a good time.</v>

2292
01:58:16.901 --> 01:58:18.040
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty crazy.</v>

2293
01:58:18.041 --> 01:58:18.874
<v Speaker 3>Even as they were getting kicked out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rest of the audience was having a </v>

2294
01:58:20.621 --> 01:58:22.930
<v Speaker 3>good time because we're making fun of </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2295
01:58:23.170 --> 01:58:25.570
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as these people were getting kicked out,</v>

2296
01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:29.020
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is basically us.</v>

2297
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:30.303
<v Speaker 3>Most of us are cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a hundred and 50 people in here </v>

2298
01:58:33.911 --> 01:58:34.744
<v Speaker 3>and out of 150 people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred 48 of them are having a great </v>

2299
01:58:38.531 --> 01:58:40.720
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's drinking.</v>

2300
01:58:40.721 --> 01:58:45.721
<v Speaker 3>and and where all these comedians and no</v>
<v Speaker 3>one wants any extraordinary attention,</v>

2301
01:58:46.301 --> 01:58:49.630
<v Speaker 3>no one wants any special attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to people fucked it up.</v>

2302
01:58:49.630 --> 01:58:52.690
<v Speaker 3>Now if you were next to those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would say,</v>

2303
01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:54.640
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the crowd there sucks.</v>

2304
01:58:54.940 --> 01:58:55.773
<v Speaker 3>The people are always yelling things out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're drunks and they hackle will </v>

2305
01:58:59.111 --> 01:58:59.944
<v Speaker 3>because that those two people required </v>
<v Speaker 3>an exorbitant amount of attention that </v>

2306
01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:05.050
<v Speaker 3>they asked for more attention than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone else.</v>

2307
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:08.650
<v Speaker 3>And if you use that bias sample group </v>
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>

2308
01:59:08.651 --> 01:59:09.484
<v Speaker 3>well this is the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The crowd is these drunk people that </v>

2309
01:59:12.311 --> 01:59:13.144
<v Speaker 3>yelled at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2310
01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:14.073
<v Speaker 3>the fast majority of the crowd are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really polite fund people out having a </v>

2311
01:59:17.861 --> 01:59:18.694
<v Speaker 3>good time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they approached it with the perfect </v>

2312
01:59:20.561 --> 01:59:22.870
<v Speaker 3>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the world.</v>

2313
01:59:22.871 --> 01:59:24.550
<v Speaker 3>This is the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the world is.</v>

2314
01:59:24.551 --> 01:59:28.390
<v Speaker 3>There's a small percentage of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that fuck things up for everybody.</v>

2315
01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:32.290
<v Speaker 3>And I think that this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is in terms of politics,</v>

2316
01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:34.480
<v Speaker 3>in terms of business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of everything,</v>

2317
01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:35.710
<v Speaker 3>is that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2318
01:59:35.711 --> 01:59:37.090
<v Speaker 3>in terms of the net for sure.</v>

2319
01:59:37.210 --> 01:59:40.360
<v Speaker 3>And I think the net is the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of that.</v>

2320
01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:41.313
<v Speaker 3>If you're a person that gets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If something happens to you and people </v>

2321
01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:50.080
<v Speaker 3>started attacking you online for it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just noticed the number of people</v>

2322
01:59:50.081 --> 01:59:52.210
<v Speaker 3>thAt say you're involved in some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>a story,</v>

2323
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:53.383
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say maybe there's a million people that </v>

2324
01:59:55.691 --> 02:00:00.310
<v Speaker 3>know about this story and you get a 150 </v>
<v Speaker 3>people send you mean things.</v>

2325
02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.890
<v Speaker 3>You think at the end of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>150 people a unit.</v>

2326
02:00:03.160 --> 02:00:07.060
<v Speaker 3>You don't notice that it's a hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just see All these messages and it's</v>

2327
02:00:07.061 --> 02:00:08.050
<v Speaker 3>an.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unmanageable.</v>

2328
02:00:08.051 --> 02:00:09.130
<v Speaker 3>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

2329
02:00:09.131 --> 02:00:10.600
<v Speaker 3>everyone hates me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2330
02:00:10.750 --> 02:00:11.583
<v Speaker 3>a hundred and 50 people have decided to </v>
<v Speaker 3>take action and make you feel bad </v>

2331
02:00:15.101 --> 02:00:15.934
<v Speaker 3>because they feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a small number in terms of the </v>

2332
02:00:18.251 --> 02:00:21.190
<v Speaker 3>overall number of human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you are louis,</v>

2333
02:00:21.191 --> 02:00:23.620
<v Speaker 3>c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>k and it's coming at you,</v>

2334
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holy shit.</v>

2335
02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:26.860
<v Speaker 3>The world fucking hates me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2336
02:00:26.861 --> 02:00:28.060
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

2337
02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:29.133
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the situation that we're in </v>

2338
02:00:31.271 --> 02:00:34.870
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just have so many voices.</v>

2339
02:00:35.170 --> 02:00:38.410
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible though because out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all those voices,</v>

2340
02:00:38.411 --> 02:00:39.244
<v Speaker 3>as long as you're not personally trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure it out and filter it yourself </v>

2341
02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:46.360
<v Speaker 3>with your own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is completely impossible,</v>

2342
02:00:46.690 --> 02:00:49.090
<v Speaker 3>but if you could just look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>objectives from afar,</v>

2343
02:00:50.080 --> 02:00:50.913
<v Speaker 3>this is going to work itself out in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>far better way than has ever happened </v>

2344
02:00:52.901 --> 02:00:53.734
<v Speaker 3>before in our past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's never been this many voices and </v>

2345
02:00:56.351 --> 02:00:57.184
<v Speaker 3>our pastor has been like you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about a select few voices that </v>

2346
02:00:59.701 --> 02:01:00.534
<v Speaker 3>walter cronkite's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whoever it is at the top and then </v>

2347
02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:04.443
<v Speaker 3>everyone else sort of had to wait for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the narrative to be spelled out for </v>

2348
02:01:07.721 --> 02:01:08.350
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>RighT.</v>

2349
02:01:08.350 --> 02:01:09.880
<v Speaker 3>That's not the case anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

2350
02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:11.110
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and again,</v>

2351
02:01:11.111 --> 02:01:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the best of times and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>worst of times.</v>

2352
02:01:12.940 --> 02:01:13.773
<v Speaker 3>So it's the best of times because all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these new voices are bringing all sorts </v>

2353
02:01:17.411 --> 02:01:18.244
<v Speaker 3>of great perspective and insight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence to the story that wasn't </v>

2354
02:01:22.151 --> 02:01:23.710
<v Speaker 3>there before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's great.</v>

2355
02:01:24.430 --> 02:01:25.263
<v Speaker 3>The problem is is if the infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 3>that used to be there to kind of bring </v>

2356
02:01:29.561 --> 02:01:30.394
<v Speaker 3>us up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bring us all up to kind of basic level </v>

2357
02:01:32.471 --> 02:01:33.304
<v Speaker 3>so that we understood the facts </v>
<v Speaker 3>disappears so they don't have anything </v>

2358
02:01:37.001 --> 02:01:39.770
<v Speaker 3>that kind of makes it so that we all </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand what's at issue and what's at</v>

2359
02:01:39.771 --> 02:01:40.070
<v Speaker 3>stake</v>

2360
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>and what the facts are so that we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>act as a democracy in a sensible way.</v>

2361
02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Then the question is how do we run a </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy?</v>

2362
02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:48.913
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if we could have all these </v>

2363
02:01:49.521 --> 02:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2364
02:01:50.781 --> 02:01:51.614
<v Speaker 1>I like to think about the difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the culture channel and the </v>

2365
02:01:53.511 --> 02:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>democracy channels and the culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

2366
02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:56.473
<v Speaker 1>This is the best of times by orders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>magnitude and the stuff on television </v>

2367
02:01:59.751 --> 02:02:00.584
<v Speaker 1>today is a billion times better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything from the 19 seventies in 19 </v>

2368
02:02:04.170 --> 02:02:05.003
<v Speaker 1>eighties and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a product of this incredible </v>

2369
02:02:07.821 --> 02:02:08.654
<v Speaker 1>competition and the fact that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>have anything and any niche market and </v>

2370
02:02:12.501 --> 02:02:13.334
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to do it and that's </v>

2371
02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:16.513
<v Speaker 1>what's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you turn to the democracy </v>

2372
02:02:18.231 --> 02:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same fragmentation,</v>

2373
02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:21.733
<v Speaker 1>the same niche market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same reality of us all living in </v>

2374
02:02:24.321 --> 02:02:25.154
<v Speaker 1>these different universes means we can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>address problems as a democracy with </v>

2375
02:02:29.841 --> 02:02:30.950
<v Speaker 1>even the same facts.</v>

2376
02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's a real problem because if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>all live in our own fact universe,</v>

2377
02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:36.963
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to save face the same real </v>

2378
02:02:38.361 --> 02:02:39.194
<v Speaker 1>problems in the same real earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're not going to decide them in </v>

2379
02:02:42.111 --> 02:02:45.260
<v Speaker 1>any sensible way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And How you solve that problem is really</v>

2380
02:02:45.261 --> 02:02:46.910
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we're not going back.</v>

2381
02:02:46.911 --> 02:02:49.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank god we're not going back to the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>

2382
02:02:49.311 --> 02:02:50.144
<v Speaker 1>It's just not going to be the case that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are three channels we get to </v>

2383
02:02:52.521 --> 02:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not going to happen.</v>

2384
02:02:54.510 --> 02:02:57.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's a great thing because we've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this amazing culture,</v>

2385
02:02:57.381 --> 02:03:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but what do we do on the democracy side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we build a democracy?</v>

2386
02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:02.533
<v Speaker 1>Recognizing that everybody's not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spend all their time geeking out </v>

2387
02:03:04.791 --> 02:03:07.160
<v Speaker 1>about campaign finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reform legislation.</v>

2388
02:03:07.470 --> 02:03:08.303
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I think we need to think </v>

2389
02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:13.040
<v Speaker 1>about these other ways to bring people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to some sense of understanding.</v>

2390
02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:14.293
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brian calendar and a hunter mats were </v>

2391
02:03:17.181 --> 02:03:18.890
<v Speaker 1>the first people that brought me into </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2392
02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:19.724
<v Speaker 1>Like they put me on their podcast and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember like not even knowing when he </v>

2393
02:03:23.451 --> 02:03:26.570
<v Speaker 1>did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the length of that conversation and</v>

2394
02:03:26.571 --> 02:03:28.580
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to cut this down to?</v>

2395
02:03:28.581 --> 02:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Like six minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes.</v>

2396
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:32.360
<v Speaker 1>HoW long did you guys talk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we talked for an hour,</v>

2397
02:03:32.420 --> 02:03:33.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we're already done two hours </v>

2398
02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:35.930
<v Speaker 1>and 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy shit.</v>

2399
02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:37.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was a time warp in this row.</v>

2400
02:03:37.850 --> 02:03:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that.</v>

2401
02:03:39.741 --> 02:03:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2402
02:03:40.731 --> 02:03:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but I remember thinking like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle,</v>

2403
02:03:42.741 --> 02:03:45.740
<v Speaker 1>like I stopped and I thought whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

2404
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:47.930
<v Speaker 1>this is the changing of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

2405
02:03:47.931 --> 02:03:51.470
<v Speaker 1>And as opposed to those panel shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two talking heads for each other.</v>

2406
02:03:51.480 --> 02:03:52.313
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're on these cable </v>
<v Speaker 1>television shows and you've got 30 </v>

2407
02:03:54.021 --> 02:03:56.110
<v Speaker 1>seconds to say something and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

2408
02:03:56.420 --> 02:03:58.910
<v Speaker 1>you linked it before and I think this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really the key.</v>

2409
02:03:59.310 --> 02:04:00.143
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2410
02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:00.993
<v Speaker 1>it's exactly like diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we recognize that we have been pUt </v>

2411
02:04:05.541 --> 02:04:06.374
<v Speaker 1>into a world right now where we all eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty food because it's been designed </v>

2412
02:04:10.041 --> 02:04:11.720
<v Speaker 1>to make it so tasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we love it,</v>

2413
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:14.150
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only way we reformed that,</v>

2414
02:04:14.240 --> 02:04:16.460
<v Speaker 1>if individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one by one,</v>

2415
02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>began to decide to eat the right stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2416
02:04:19.220 --> 02:04:20.053
<v Speaker 1>You've got to Decide to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage in the right kind of healthy </v>

2417
02:04:23.391 --> 02:04:24.224
<v Speaker 1>behavior to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to survive in this world </v>

2418
02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:26.953
<v Speaker 1>because the incentives of the market are</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sell you stuff that doesn't </v>

2419
02:04:30.291 --> 02:04:33.170
<v Speaker 1>necessarily do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing with the information</v>

2420
02:04:33.171 --> 02:04:34.004
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why the slow food movement is </v>

2421
02:04:36.441 --> 02:04:37.274
<v Speaker 1>like the slow democracy movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the slow food movement is how do </v>

2422
02:04:40.081 --> 02:04:43.800
<v Speaker 1>you produce food that's actually healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that feeds you.</v>

2423
02:04:43.860 --> 02:04:47.430
<v Speaker 1>It feeds your body in the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the slo democracy movement,</v>

2424
02:04:47.431 --> 02:04:48.264
<v Speaker 1>how do you feed a democracy and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements to that have got to be context </v>

2425
02:04:52.111 --> 02:04:57.111
<v Speaker 1>where people are free to get deeper than</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds and if we don't build more of</v>

2426
02:04:57.931 --> 02:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>those we're gonna have.</v>

2427
02:04:59.290 --> 02:05:01.860
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a really desperate </v>
<v Speaker 1>time for democracy.</v>

2428
02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:02.694
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have what we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the rise of authoritarians </v>

2429
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:05.183
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you foresee the possibility of </v>

2430
02:05:08.251 --> 02:05:09.084
<v Speaker 1>alternative social media outlets sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewing all the issues that people do </v>

2431
02:05:15.181 --> 02:05:19.620
<v Speaker 1>have with google or facebook or twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>or any of these,</v>

2432
02:05:19.650 --> 02:05:20.483
<v Speaker 1>what are perceived to be biased sources </v>
<v Speaker 1>of information and coming up with </v>

2433
02:05:24.211 --> 02:05:27.810
<v Speaker 1>something that has clear protections in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

2434
02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:28.713
<v Speaker 1>Sort of like the founding fathers did </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they established our system of </v>

2435
02:05:32.161 --> 02:05:33.720
<v Speaker 1>government that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

2436
02:05:33.930 --> 02:05:35.430
<v Speaker 1>we don't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

2437
02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:40.460
<v Speaker 1>let's organize that as we're starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure that this doesn't doesn't ever</v>

2438
02:05:40.591 --> 02:05:43.220
<v Speaker 1>turn into some sort of an echo chamber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2439
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I am way above my pay grade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2440
02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:49.170
<v Speaker 1>but what I know gets us there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

2441
02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:50.993
<v Speaker 1>I know that the only thing that has ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten us to the next great innovation </v>

2442
02:05:55.500 --> 02:05:58.470
<v Speaker 1>is the enforcement of competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why it's a problem when someone</v>

2443
02:05:58.471 --> 02:06:00.370
<v Speaker 1>like facebook absolutely buys in store.</v>

2444
02:06:00.410 --> 02:06:01.243
<v Speaker 1>What gave us the internet was </v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions by the government against </v>

2445
02:06:04.771 --> 02:06:05.604
<v Speaker 1>a t and t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the dominant </v>

2446
02:06:08.010 --> 02:06:12.000
<v Speaker 1>telecommunications company for more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>a century that finally said,</v>

2447
02:06:12.001 --> 02:06:14.730
<v Speaker 1>enough of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't leverage your power to control</v>

2448
02:06:14.731 --> 02:06:18.270
<v Speaker 1>all innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once that intervention happened,</v>

2449
02:06:18.630 --> 02:06:20.730
<v Speaker 1>people could layer on top of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>wires,</v>

2450
02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:24.660
<v Speaker 1>a new network called the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when they did that,</v>

2451
02:06:24.930 --> 02:06:28.590
<v Speaker 1>government said to companies like cable </v>
<v Speaker 1>television companies,</v>

2452
02:06:28.710 --> 02:06:29.281
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2453
02:06:29.281 --> 02:06:31.950
<v Speaker 1>you've got broadband across your cable </v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

2454
02:06:32.460 --> 02:06:36.870
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you get to decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>what applications go on that cable line.</v>

2455
02:06:37.290 --> 02:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hbs.</v>

2456
02:06:38.740 --> 02:06:39.573
<v Speaker 1>You mean near The cable company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say that there can't be </v>

2457
02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:46.110
<v Speaker 1>netflix on the cable or you can't slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>netflix down.</v>

2458
02:06:46.111 --> 02:06:46.944
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously they would want a slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>night fix down because netflix is a </v>

2459
02:06:50.371 --> 02:06:53.130
<v Speaker 1>competitor with their basic business </v>
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>

2460
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:54.263
<v Speaker 1>but the intervention to assure </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition created the opportunity for </v>

2461
02:06:58.441 --> 02:07:00.090
<v Speaker 1>these great new innovations.</v>

2462
02:07:00.120 --> 02:07:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Now nobody at the beginning of that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>any clue about what would come out of </v>

2463
02:07:04.351 --> 02:07:07.590
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All that they knew was that the only way</v>

2464
02:07:07.591 --> 02:07:10.560
<v Speaker 1>to get something new and create was to </v>
<v Speaker 1>assure competition.</v>

2465
02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:14.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's the commitment we've given up</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2000,</v>

2466
02:07:14.790 --> 02:07:17.730
<v Speaker 1>since George Bush became president in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2001,</v>

2467
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:19.103
<v Speaker 1>there's been no major enforcement action</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the antitrust department against any </v>

2468
02:07:22.471 --> 02:07:25.800
<v Speaker 1>of these companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a huge problem.</v>

2469
02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:29.100
<v Speaker 1>And until we rediscover the importance </v>
<v Speaker 1>of competition,</v>

2470
02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:32.760
<v Speaker 1>not because we're geniuses and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the future will bring,</v>

2471
02:07:32.761 --> 02:07:33.594
<v Speaker 1>but because we know from the past that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way the future comes is if you </v>

2472
02:07:36.791 --> 02:07:39.100
<v Speaker 1>guarantee competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless we do that,</v>

2473
02:07:39.101 --> 02:07:40.810
<v Speaker 1>we're never going to solve any of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

2474
02:07:41.410 --> 02:07:42.243
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ensuring competition is ensuring </v>

2475
02:07:43.721 --> 02:07:44.554
<v Speaker 1>innovations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensuring and anybody who doesn't want </v>

2476
02:07:46.631 --> 02:07:47.464
<v Speaker 1>competition wants to stifle innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's got to be thought to be a </v>

2477
02:07:49.871 --> 02:07:52.270
<v Speaker 1>selfish proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the basic.</v>

2478
02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:54.750
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic argument and competition law,</v>

2479
02:07:54.920 --> 02:07:55.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's competition law got taken over </v>

2480
02:07:56.681 --> 02:08:00.850
<v Speaker 1>by a bunch of chicago economists who </v>
<v Speaker 1>said the only question was efficiency or</v>

2481
02:08:00.851 --> 02:08:01.684
<v Speaker 1>consumer welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's another perspective that </v>

2482
02:08:04.631 --> 02:08:07.030
<v Speaker 1>libertarians like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luigi zingAles,</v>

2483
02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:07.893
<v Speaker 1>who's an economist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that university of chicago business </v>

2484
02:08:09.371 --> 02:08:10.930
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2485
02:08:11.110 --> 02:08:11.943
<v Speaker 1>and people who are not libertarians like</v>
<v Speaker 1>tim wu who's a professor at columbia </v>

2486
02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:16.173
<v Speaker 1>embrace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the idea of political </v>

2487
02:08:17.291 --> 02:08:18.124
<v Speaker 1>antitrust and the idea of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>antitrust is you should also worry if </v>

2488
02:08:22.151 --> 02:08:25.480
<v Speaker 1>companies are so big that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt the government,</v>

2489
02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:27.820
<v Speaker 1>like this is a dimension to worry about </v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

2490
02:08:28.330 --> 02:08:30.910
<v Speaker 1>because if they get to be so big that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can corrupt the government,</v>

2491
02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:31.773
<v Speaker 1>then you know that they will use that </v>
<v Speaker 1>power to protect themselves against </v>

2492
02:08:35.260 --> 02:08:37.660
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if an innovator comes,</v>

2493
02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:41.290
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't come with 50 lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does comes with a great idea.</v>

2494
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:42.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2495
02:08:42.520 --> 02:08:43.353
<v Speaker 1>elon musk saw this dramatically as he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing this incredible alternative </v>

2496
02:08:47.350 --> 02:08:50.140
<v Speaker 1>and tried to figure out how to sell it </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of states.</v>

2497
02:08:50.141 --> 02:08:50.974
<v Speaker 1>And then the lobbyists for the car </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies would go state by state and </v>

2498
02:08:53.591 --> 02:08:58.420
<v Speaker 1>forbid them from being able to sell cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a local dealership in the state.</v>

2499
02:08:58.450 --> 02:08:59.283
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a huge fight as the incumbent </v>

2500
02:09:01.061 --> 02:09:01.894
<v Speaker 1>industries leveraged their power over </v>
<v Speaker 1>government to protect themselves from </v>

2501
02:09:05.561 --> 02:09:07.990
<v Speaker 1>this new competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the,</v>

2502
02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:11.560
<v Speaker 1>this is the fight we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to make central again because if</v>

2503
02:09:11.561 --> 02:09:12.394
<v Speaker 1>we don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the dinosaurs will have the power </v>

2504
02:09:15.131 --> 02:09:18.730
<v Speaker 1>through this corrupted political system </v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect themselves against the future</v>

2505
02:09:19.210 --> 02:09:20.043
<v Speaker 1>and this is just the moment when we need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out how to make the future </v>

2506
02:09:22.301 --> 02:09:23.134
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad you're raising these warning </v>

2507
02:09:24.551 --> 02:09:27.040
<v Speaker 1>flags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like from talking to you that</v>

2508
02:09:27.041 --> 02:09:28.330
<v Speaker 1>you're fairly optimistic.</v>

2509
02:09:30.520 --> 02:09:32.500
<v Speaker 1>You're the first person who's ever said </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2510
02:09:32.600 --> 02:09:33.433
<v Speaker 1>Really feel like you're optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're perception of the internet and </v>

2511
02:09:37.390 --> 02:09:40.220
<v Speaker 1>the young people coming up and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2512
02:09:40.330 --> 02:09:43.480
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way information is being distributed</v>

2513
02:09:43.481 --> 02:09:44.314
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's so many people </v>

2514
02:09:45.581 --> 02:09:48.970
<v Speaker 1>participating in it and there's so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition even in that form.</v>

2515
02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's.</v>

2516
02:09:50.770 --> 02:09:51.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more voices now and there's a </v>

2517
02:09:53.621 --> 02:09:54.454
<v Speaker 1>lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look in the past when you had to be </v>

2518
02:09:56.291 --> 02:09:57.124
<v Speaker 1>selected in order to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very difficult to get through </v>

2519
02:10:00.701 --> 02:10:01.534
<v Speaker 1>that selection process and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the best voices that got </v>

2520
02:10:04.361 --> 02:10:05.194
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sometimes the most persistent and </v>

2521
02:10:07.121 --> 02:10:07.954
<v Speaker 1>the most influential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the reason why they got it to </v>

2522
02:10:09.761 --> 02:10:14.590
<v Speaker 1>be one of those people with the tie in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that block on those panel shows,</v>

2523
02:10:14.860 --> 02:10:16.540
<v Speaker 1>that's not the case anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2524
02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:18.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you've got kyle kalinsky,</v>

2525
02:10:18.881 --> 02:10:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you've got all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know these,</v>

2526
02:10:20.590 --> 02:10:21.700
<v Speaker 1>these people that are.</v>

2527
02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:24.680
<v Speaker 1>They don't necessarily fit in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2528
02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:25.983
<v Speaker 1>any traditional jimmy dore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't fit in any traditional role </v>

2529
02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:32.223
<v Speaker 1>on regular mainstream television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a pretty influential </v>

2530
02:10:34.731 --> 02:10:35.680
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

2531
02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:36.673
<v Speaker 1>And they're very polItically savvy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about things in a way </v>

2532
02:10:40.161 --> 02:10:41.780
<v Speaker 1>that they would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be.</v>

2533
02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:43.353
<v Speaker 1>it would be very hard to get a producer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sign off on the way a lot of these </v>

2534
02:10:46.131 --> 02:10:49.280
<v Speaker 1>guys communicate and some of the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they do be.</v>

2535
02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:50.900
<v Speaker 1>It would be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult,</v>

2536
02:10:50.901 --> 02:10:51.890
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're optimistic.</v>

2537
02:10:52.190 --> 02:10:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm very optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm optimistic in that space.</v>

2538
02:10:54.681 --> 02:10:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I guess everything outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beltway of Washington,</v>

2539
02:10:57.081 --> 02:10:57.914
<v Speaker 1>I'm optimistic about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think America has an incredible </v>

2540
02:11:00.651 --> 02:11:02.690
<v Speaker 1>capacity to innovate out of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

2541
02:11:03.290 --> 02:11:04.123
<v Speaker 1>What I fear and what I'm not sure any </v>
<v Speaker 1>rational person should be optimistic </v>

2542
02:11:07.071 --> 02:11:07.904
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you don't fight </v>

2543
02:11:09.201 --> 02:11:11.840
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I fear is Washington and um,</v>

2544
02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:13.093
<v Speaker 1>and so I've said many times like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>power of corruption in Washington might </v>

2545
02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:19.513
<v Speaker 1>be so great that it cannot be defeated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't affect what we should </v>

2546
02:11:24.411 --> 02:11:25.010
<v Speaker 1>be doing.</v>

2547
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:27.890
<v Speaker 1>We should be fighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not we think we can win.</v>

2548
02:11:28.100 --> 02:11:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Winning is not the only reason you </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>

2549
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:30.703
<v Speaker 1>You fight because it's the right thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and we need to rally because we </v>

2550
02:11:33.921 --> 02:11:34.754
<v Speaker 1>might be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could just be that if we got the </v>

2551
02:11:38.061 --> 02:11:40.420
<v Speaker 1>political forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could take them down and,</v>

2552
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:42.980
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's what we got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting up for it right now.</v>

2553
02:11:43.040 --> 02:11:43.873
<v Speaker 1>When you see people like tulsi gabbard </v>
<v Speaker 1>or will you see this young woman in New </v>

2554
02:11:48.050 --> 02:11:48.890
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alexandria,</v>

2555
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:51.200
<v Speaker 1>a casio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>casio cortez,</v>

2556
02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:52.483
<v Speaker 1>that to me that's very promising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people are leanIng in this </v>

2557
02:11:55.491 --> 02:11:57.230
<v Speaker 1>direction and that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're saying,</v>

2558
02:11:57.231 --> 02:11:58.670
<v Speaker 1>let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

2559
02:11:58.700 --> 02:12:02.120
<v Speaker 1>let's look at this in a different way </v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's see some new voices.</v>

2560
02:12:02.121 --> 02:12:02.954
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's hear people that are clearly not </v>

2561
02:12:05.181 --> 02:12:08.390
<v Speaker 1>influenced by corporate America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're clearly not.</v>

2562
02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:12.620
<v Speaker 1>They don't have all of their veins </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooked up to the matrix yet.</v>

2563
02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:17.030
<v Speaker 1>Now I tulsa I had known before your </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview with her,</v>

2564
02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:20.660
<v Speaker 1>your interview with her I think gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>people a incredible understanding of the</v>

2565
02:12:20.661 --> 02:12:21.950
<v Speaker 1>depth of her soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is deep.</v>

2566
02:12:22.070 --> 02:12:23.750
<v Speaker 1>How about when she tweeted to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

2567
02:12:23.751 --> 02:12:27.860
<v Speaker 1>making us Saudi Arabia is bitch is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting us America first so she can go.</v>

2568
02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:31.140
<v Speaker 1>She can both do the deep and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shallow.</v>

2569
02:12:31.141 --> 02:12:32.630
<v Speaker 1>She can do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2570
02:12:32.670 --> 02:12:33.503
<v Speaker 1>That is an unprecedented thing too </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what trump has done is he's </v>

2571
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:41.570
<v Speaker 1>opened up the door for this kind of very</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile communication,</v>

2572
02:12:41.571 --> 02:12:45.560
<v Speaker 1>but what he's also done is opened up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>door for it to come back at him.</v>

2573
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Not that he notices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>

2574
02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:48.850
<v Speaker 1>You're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly right.</v>

2575
02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:49.753
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the world notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I think is interesting about </v>

2576
02:12:51.621 --> 02:12:56.420
<v Speaker 1>alexandria is she is very disciplined </v>
<v Speaker 1>about saying,</v>

2577
02:12:56.570 --> 02:12:57.403
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to fix the system if we're </v>

2578
02:12:58.521 --> 02:12:59.930
<v Speaker 1>going to get any of these things done.</v>

2579
02:12:59.930 --> 02:13:02.120
<v Speaker 1>So I like to think about like alexandria</v>
<v Speaker 1>or versus bernie,</v>

2580
02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:05.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so she like every time she gets up there</v>

2581
02:13:05.361 --> 02:13:08.750
<v Speaker 1>and talks about her green energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new deal,</v>

2582
02:13:09.150 --> 02:13:09.983
<v Speaker 1>it's like you got to fix the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and then we're going to be able </v>

2583
02:13:12.051 --> 02:13:12.884
<v Speaker 1>to get this stuff as opposed to like </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting a list of 10 things you want to </v>

2584
02:13:16.221 --> 02:13:17.054
<v Speaker 1>do without anywhere even mentioning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that you're going to make these </v>

2585
02:13:20.271 --> 02:13:22.520
<v Speaker 1>things possible by pixeling fixing </v>
<v Speaker 1>political system.</v>

2586
02:13:22.521 --> 02:13:23.354
<v Speaker 1>I think we need new people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which this new congress is filled with </v>

2587
02:13:26.121 --> 02:13:27.980
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a hundred and seven members,</v>

2588
02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:29.113
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people running for congress who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote to speaker of the house and said </v>

2589
02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 1>they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the first thing is addressing of this</v>

2590
02:13:35.491 --> 02:13:37.770
<v Speaker 1>corrupt political system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nancy pelosi gave them,</v>

2591
02:13:37.771 --> 02:13:40.170
<v Speaker 1>not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all these other reforms to it.</v>

2592
02:13:40.171 --> 02:13:41.004
<v Speaker 1>That's hr one.</v>

2593
02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:45.270
<v Speaker 1>The younger people coming into congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realIzed the system is broken.</v>

2594
02:13:45.690 --> 02:13:46.523
<v Speaker 1>I fear the older people in congress have</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten so used to the system that they </v>

2595
02:13:49.171 --> 02:13:51.450
<v Speaker 1>don't even notice anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just how broken it is,</v>

2596
02:13:51.451 --> 02:13:54.150
<v Speaker 1>how outrageous it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they need to rage.</v>

2597
02:13:54.151 --> 02:13:56.400
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to rage against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaires or whatever,</v>

2598
02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:57.473
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need to focus the rage on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem and that problem is </v>

2599
02:14:00.811 --> 02:14:03.240
<v Speaker 1>congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't fix congress first,</v>

2600
02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:04.113
<v Speaker 1>nothing else matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing else will happen and we need to </v>

2601
02:14:06.721 --> 02:14:07.554
<v Speaker 1>build the movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think could actually be a </v>

2602
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:11.003
<v Speaker 1>movement that brings people on the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people on the left in to make that </v>

2603
02:14:14.431 --> 02:14:15.264
<v Speaker 1>change possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The philosophy that you have to have </v>

2604
02:14:17.611 --> 02:14:18.444
<v Speaker 1>darKness in order to inspire light and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some sort of a balance to </v>

2605
02:14:20.881 --> 02:14:21.714
<v Speaker 1>be achieved in this managing of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>two energies And that when you have an </v>

2606
02:14:27.061 --> 02:14:32.061
<v Speaker 1>administration that's clearly fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then people come along and say,</v>

2607
02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:33.953
<v Speaker 1>it's time that I get into politics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a difference and these are the </v>

2608
02:14:35.851 --> 02:14:39.180
<v Speaker 1>people that are motivated because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>see a need for change.</v>

2609
02:14:39.390 --> 02:14:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Whereas some people with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>

2610
02:14:42.311 --> 02:14:43.770
<v Speaker 1>so like I liked the way things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

2611
02:14:43.771 --> 02:14:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go pursue the private </v>
<v Speaker 1>sector.</v>

2612
02:14:45.571 --> 02:14:46.404
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do people see something </v>

2613
02:14:48.691 --> 02:14:50.460
<v Speaker 1>like what's happening with trump?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

2614
02:14:50.461 --> 02:14:52.980
<v Speaker 1>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to stop this.</v>

2615
02:14:52.981 --> 02:14:53.814
<v Speaker 1>This is not the America that I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people entering politics for </v>

2616
02:14:56.491 --> 02:14:57.324
<v Speaker 1>the best possible and I think people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the right have entered politics for the </v>

2617
02:15:00.841 --> 02:15:01.674
<v Speaker 1>best possible reason and people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left to the question is how quickly do </v>

2618
02:15:05.071 --> 02:15:05.904
<v Speaker 1>they get bent by the system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How quickly do they become part of the </v>

2619
02:15:09.421 --> 02:15:11.370
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dark side of the forest?</v>

2620
02:15:11.550 --> 02:15:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Because like when you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2621
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:17.410
<v Speaker 1>when you say members of congress spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>30 to 80 percent of them,</v>

2622
02:15:17.530 --> 02:15:18.363
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of the time raising money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that means they're </v>

2623
02:15:20.251 --> 02:15:21.840
<v Speaker 1>miserable most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2624
02:15:21.841 --> 02:15:25.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a way in which it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically rewarding for them.</v>

2625
02:15:25.650 --> 02:15:26.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2626
02:15:26.740 --> 02:15:27.573
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a member of congress right now is </v>

2627
02:15:28.831 --> 02:15:31.560
<v Speaker 1>a pretty miserable job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get much done.</v>

2628
02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:34.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you're spending all your time like </v>
<v Speaker 1>rats in a maze.</v>

2629
02:15:34.321 --> 02:15:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Like the bell goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to run to the floor.</v>

2630
02:15:36.900 --> 02:15:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Your aide tells you how your two votes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you vote and you leave from the floor.</v>

2631
02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:42.600
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing like what the framers </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined.</v>

2632
02:15:42.601 --> 02:15:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Like they were sitting on the floor </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to debate about ideas.</v>

2633
02:15:44.941 --> 02:15:45.774
<v Speaker 1>All that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only debate is debate to cspan as </v>

2634
02:15:48.410 --> 02:15:50.640
<v Speaker 1>like a speech to cspan and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

2635
02:15:50.690 --> 02:15:51.523
<v Speaker 1>and that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the life of a congressman is pretty </v>

2636
02:15:52.951 --> 02:15:54.650
<v Speaker 1>miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

2637
02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:58.200
<v Speaker 1>but when they fundraise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like pushups,</v>

2638
02:15:58.700 --> 02:16:00.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down and they're told,</v>

2639
02:16:00.931 --> 02:16:02.760
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to raise $20,000.</v>

2640
02:16:03.270 --> 02:16:05.550
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aid sit there and say call joe,</v>

2641
02:16:05.551 --> 02:16:08.850
<v Speaker 1>he cares about this and call fred and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>cares about that.</v>

2642
02:16:08.851 --> 02:16:10.800
<v Speaker 1>And you go through and when you hit your</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

2643
02:16:10.801 --> 02:16:11.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooray,</v>

2644
02:16:11.791 --> 02:16:13.860
<v Speaker 1>I did something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>

2645
02:16:13.861 --> 02:16:16.200
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you're accomplishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

2646
02:16:16.201 --> 02:16:17.034
<v Speaker 1>but the point is the psychology of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly makes you okay with the </v>

2647
02:16:21.931 --> 02:16:25.620
<v Speaker 1>system that you're in and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>you win in that system.</v>

2648
02:16:25.621 --> 02:16:26.454
<v Speaker 1>You've won under that system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so your openness to changing the </v>

2649
02:16:29.321 --> 02:16:30.190
<v Speaker 1>system becomes</v>

2650
02:16:30.190 --> 02:16:34.150
<v Speaker 2>really sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the critical moment right now</v>

2651
02:16:34.151 --> 02:16:34.984
<v Speaker 2>is to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to solidify the recognition this </v>

2652
02:16:37.510 --> 02:16:40.900
<v Speaker 2>congress is corrupted and we have to fix</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2653
02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:44.180
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing I'm worried about with hr</v>

2654
02:16:44.181 --> 02:16:47.020
<v Speaker 2>one is that it's gonna make it into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic issue.</v>

2655
02:16:47.021 --> 02:16:47.854
<v Speaker 2>It's like that democrats care about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the republicans are supposed to not </v>

2656
02:16:50.051 --> 02:16:50.884
<v Speaker 2>care about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The critical thing now is to get </v>

2657
02:16:51.971 --> 02:16:52.804
<v Speaker 2>republicans to support the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reform and then make it something other </v>

2658
02:16:56.291 --> 02:16:58.780
<v Speaker 2>than just a traditional tribal fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>between left and right.</v>

2659
02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:00.693
<v Speaker 2>Are you optimistiC?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was I correct in that I'm optimistic </v>

2660
02:17:05.381 --> 02:17:09.230
<v Speaker 2>about everything outside of the beltway </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm going to fight like hell to,</v>

2661
02:17:09.290 --> 02:17:10.123
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to prove that we can fix stuff inside </v>

2662
02:17:11.831 --> 02:17:12.664
<v Speaker 2>the beltway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you told me I had to bet on my </v>

2663
02:17:14.171 --> 02:17:16.810
<v Speaker 2>son or daughter's life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to tell you that.</v>

2664
02:17:16.811 --> 02:17:18.480
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to say I would never</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask you to do.</v>

2665
02:17:18.520 --> 02:17:19.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

2666
02:17:19.330 --> 02:17:20.610
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're clear.</v>

2667
02:17:21.190 --> 02:17:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really appreciate it.</v>

2668
02:17:22.841 --> 02:17:24.850
<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed talking to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do this again.</v>

2669
02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully you'll be right every time you</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask.</v>

2670
02:17:27.170 --> 02:17:28.060
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll do it.</v>

2671
02:17:28.061 --> 02:17:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate it.</v>
