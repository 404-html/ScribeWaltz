<v Speaker 1>He's over there taking motherfuckers </v>

74
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:01.324
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go down his tour list and you check </v>

75
00:03:02.751 --> 00:03:03.584
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check it with the papers of enemies of </v>

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>the state who been taken out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit fucking lines up,</v>

77
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I wasn't the specifics,</v>

78
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

79
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.983
<v Speaker 1>I got a little stone and I thought this </v>
<v Speaker 1>was what happened and I should have </v>

80
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>asked him about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true.</v>

81
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>But so he just started accusing them of </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a CIA has done to his face.</v>

82
00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I did it on a couple of radio shows and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

83
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is probably going to break it </v>
<v Speaker 1>open a little bit,</v>

84
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now he's,</v>

85
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.543
<v Speaker 1>he won't.</v>

86
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>Why will he confront me about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's true.</v>

87
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why is this new album all about him?</v>

88
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.993
<v Speaker 1>You heard the record.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just him talking to his son because </v>

89
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:40.950
<v Speaker 1>he's seeing shit at night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

90
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.670
<v Speaker 1>he seen the shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

91
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:43.683
<v Speaker 1>why do you write an album about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious about jill as like a serious </v>

92
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>talk to your child because you've seen </v>
<v Speaker 1>should go down.</v>

93
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:57.121
<v Speaker 1>You've seen motherfuckers tell you he </v>
<v Speaker 1>loves his kid and no one does that.</v>

94
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a reason to make a record.</v>

95
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 1>He says he's telling his kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warning him,</v>

96
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>don't do what I did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>and he's a hired government assassin and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm almost positive about this it.</v>

98
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.510
<v Speaker 1>But I'm also getting the truth out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

99
00:04:10.511 --> 00:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>What don't you worry he's going to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>you out for exposing them.</v>

100
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm talking about it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>now they know if he takes me out,</v>

101
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>we'll know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll then my story will be true.</v>

102
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.343
<v Speaker 1>That's what that guy thought in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that dude in Russia that was </v>

103
00:04:22.121 --> 00:04:23.190
<v Speaker 1>talking shit about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>about Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a,</v>

105
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>like a political rival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Putin that he thought because he was</v>

106
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>so public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd never take them out.</v>

107
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>They shot him with his girlfriend while </v>
<v Speaker 1>he was with his girlfriend.</v>

108
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.620
<v Speaker 1>They shot him in front of a government </v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

109
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.650
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't help my fucking anxiety for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>

110
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>They'll just get you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

111
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you go to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tour Russia.</v>

112
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

113
00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

114
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

115
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.510
<v Speaker 1>my facts aren't like 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

116
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>but from what I've seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't he talk to me about it?</v>

117
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Then you say,</v>
