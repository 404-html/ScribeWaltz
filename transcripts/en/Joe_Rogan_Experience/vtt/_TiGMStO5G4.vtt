WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.020
Five four,
three.
I was good that day,

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:08.850
but then the next day like oh live and we're live herb dean.

3
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:12.120
How are you sir?
I'm good.
How about yourself?
So glad we finally doing this.

4
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:15.950
You and I have talked about doing a podcast for the last like three years.
Yeah.

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.540
You know?
Yeah,
I'm,
I'm glad to be on it.
Yeah,

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.930
I ain't got what you talk to you for a little bit.
I think in,

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.980
I've said this before,

8
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.880
you have the hardest job in the sport other than the fighters does.
The fighters,

9
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.750
obviously they have the hardest job.
You have the second hardest job referees,

10
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:33.570
the second hardest job in the sport.
It's a fucking hard job.

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.950
You have so much responsibility.
Yeah,
I think you have a really hard job.

12
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.500
I think the talk,
how long do you talk more?
It's just hours.
Six hours,

13
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.140
six hours in.

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.180
Then sometimes there's not always something interesting to talk about and a or

15
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:52.080
sometimes yet,
so I think it's amazing to be able to talk about that.

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.130
It's not that easy.
It's not that hard.
Rather it's pretty easy.
I mean,

17
00:00:56.131 --> 00:00:59.260
it's just a bunch of stuff's happening and you're calling it,
and I'm,

18
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.710
I'm a blabber mouth so I can't shut the fuck up anyway.

19
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:04.330
So if there's spots where this,
it's not that interesting.

20
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.850
I find something interesting to say,
but it's not that it's,
you know,

21
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:13.230
in terms of like what,
what's happening is happening.
You know what I mean?

22
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:14.940
The guys getting hit it guys getting choked.

23
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.920
There's a lot of crazy action going on and it's really pretty easy if you're a

24
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:24.270
lifelong fan of martial arts,
like I call it,
you know,

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.000
as long as you're enthusiastic and you're interested in doing and you know,

26
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.750
you got to treat it with respect,
you've got to treat it for what it is.
You know,

27
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:34.350
you're trying to entertain people.
You're trying to,
uh,
use the,

28
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.290
your words in the most pleasing way possible.
You know,

29
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.570
you're trying to massage people's ears in a way,
you know,
you're trying to,

30
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.650
you trying to also represent what you're seeing and how special it is because

31
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.230
actually yeah,
I did it a little bit.
Not for real.
Like,
uh,

32
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.300
somehow I do this thing that was for these people,

33
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:56.690
Black Belt TV and I was with um,

34
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.060
dawn the Dragon Wilson and they're just like old fight and we're supposed to

35
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:01.260
come and take this old fight.

36
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.090
And that's why I think it's hard because I was horrible at it.

37
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.970
Old fights are harder because you might know what's already happened so you got

38
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:08.804
to play dumb.

39
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.830
And so it's like almost like you have to be an actor as well as commenting on a

40
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:17.680
fight.
I think it would be harder to call an old fight.
Yeah.

41
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.100
Because in the back of your head you'd be like,
I'm a big phony.

42
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.120
I know what's happening.
It's already happened.

43
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.390
I think they did that with some of the pride fights.
I sing,

44
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.150
I think some of the pride fights they uh,

45
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.330
they did the commentary after the action cause he might,

46
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:35.610
do you remember when pride would come on at like three o'clock in the morning

47
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.570
and we wouldn't get it to like a day later or something like that.

48
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.690
I remember one time I was the worst is when when your friends tells you,

49
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.710
cause you,
you,
you wait,
you don't look at the,
I remember I was training,

50
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.440
I think I went and I trained with savant in one time and I don't know if you

51
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:52.770
know him.
Sure.
Yeah.
And we had been in the car the whole time.
Really?
I was like,

52
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.010
well when I get home and watch pri and then right before he got dropped him off

53
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.890
at his house,
right before I get to the car he goes,
oh Vandelay Silva lost.

54
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.790
<v 1>Oh Oh.
Or something like that.
He said something like that.</v>

55
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.570
Yeah.
We would have to wait sometimes.

56
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:11.260
Like there was a couple events where I feel like it was like a week or something

57
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:15.880
crazy,
wasn't it?
So you had to like stay off the Internet for a week.

58
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.760
Which is,
which is good for me.
You know,
I could do it,
but yeah,

59
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.840
but you got to also avoid all your friends were a little internet fanatics.

60
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.330
They start talking and you're like,
stop.
Stop.
Yeah.
I don't,

61
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.420
I don't know who won yet.
These days it's so bad.

62
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:32.680
Like if I go and I do a comedy show on the night of like a big boxing match or

63
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.280
something like that,
like my text messages tell me like,

64
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.510
people start sending me to the,
they,
they can't wait to spoil shit to like,
Damn.

65
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:44.770
Galop can got robbed.
And I was like,
what?
What happened off?
Fuck.

66
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.080
And then I don't get to just watch it.

67
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:50.020
I want to just come home and hit the DVR and watch it.

68
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:54.130
I'll keep the fuck away from the news.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Let me get home.

69
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.560
But then all the text messages will get me,

70
00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.910
it's almost like I can't even read text messages.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
God dammit.

71
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.800
It's funny big.
You don't enjoy a fight,
even if it's a great fight as much.

72
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:07.840
If you don't know if you know what happened.

73
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.980
<v 2>Yeah,
no,
no,
no,
you're not.
No,
you're,
you want to watch it for the first time.</v>

74
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.000
<v 1>Yeah.
As it is.
Yeah.
Like I heard the gate,
she knocked out Barboza and I was like,</v>

75
00:04:16.001 --> 00:04:20.680
wow,
we didn't shoot that cod.
Oh my God.

76
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.000
Kate.
She's a savage.
He's a savage man.

77
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.490
He's got a special kind of savagery.
There's some,
you know,

78
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:32.920
like,
I guess it's all judged on a spectrum.

79
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.650
There's some dudes and it just so ferocious.

80
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.080
They're just so willing to lead into battle

81
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.900
<v 2>into it.
Yeah.
And to engage and yeah,
that guy,
just a gauges.</v>

82
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.560
It's a weird willingness to engage.
I'm all stuck.

83
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.530
Almost fearless willingness to engage it seems like,
like,
yeah.

84
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:51.980
When and when he's in there getting it,
that's when,
uh,

85
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.080
it seems like he's just at his happiest.
Right?
Yeah.
Crazy.
Yeah.

86
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.610
I wrapped up top like that.
Um,
I have sold,
like,
I refer a lot of fights in,
um,

87
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.410
and Russia.

88
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.740
So a I referee to fight with this guy,
um,

89
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.760
by lie of a Murat by Leia versus Solomon,

90
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.490
a man.
And it was for championship,
uh,
Aca.
Man,
these,

91
00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.010
these guys went to war.
He,
um,
he heard him early on and had him,

92
00:05:22.011 --> 00:05:25.580
you know,
almost put out and then he came back by ballet of loss,

93
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.570
but it was his is,
I mean,
as a older than him,
he's over 40,

94
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.530
pushing the pressure and made a really,
uh,
yeah,
but you can,

95
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.770
I saw that energy come out like when he was struggling through the hard times,

96
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.220
you could tell that like,
you know,
some sort of battle joy was on him.

97
00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:43.560
You know what I mean?
He's that Kinda Guy Battle Jato joy,
you know what I mean?

98
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.430
You hear it like,
oh,
he's in it,
you know,
battle joy's real shit.
Yeah.
Right.
Huh.

99
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.000
That'll joy Diego Sanchez is all full of battle droid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good example.

100
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.080
It didn't die with the Vikings as
people were experiencing battled

101
00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.650
<v 0>to I to this day.
Oh yeah.
There's my man right there.</v>

102
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.680
It is that he just look it up.

103
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.300
Fucking bodies covered in blood and you know,
and there's,
and happiest,

104
00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.290
the happiest they can be.
God Damn,
that dude's face is busted up.

105
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.420
Yeah.
It's,
um,
did you see the bare knuckle fighting having watched the,

106
00:06:18.421 --> 00:06:22.010
any of them?
Yeah.
I watched some exchanges between,
it's just,

107
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.710
it's hard to watch.
It's weird.
I was a big proponent of bare knuckle.

108
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:30.530
I was like they should fight bare knuckle cause it's ridiculous that you pad up

109
00:06:30.531 --> 00:06:34.520
only your gloves but you don't pat up your elbows,
knees.

110
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.960
But I'm

111
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.780
Jason ninth versus Artem low ball off was a,
it was a weird fight to watch man.

112
00:06:41.781 --> 00:06:45.740
I mean they beat the fuck out of each other.
I heard both came out of it.

113
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:47.330
Super cut up man.

114
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.670
Like a lifetime's worth of cuts in one fight.
Yeah.

115
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:56.310
And you,
you saw that.
It's like I think it's going to be a,
it looks like the,

116
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.350
she saw their faces that looks like it's going to be some long healing.
Yeah man.

117
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:02.900
I mean these guys beat the shit out of each other.

118
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:07.340
Bare knuckle and it's,
it is kind of weird that you do recognize,

119
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.060
first of all they're not really,
they're bare knuckle but they're not bear risks.

120
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:13.910
Like look how their hands are all wrapped up to prevent them from breaking.

121
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:18.770
Which is,
it's interesting.
It shows us how fragile our hands really are.

122
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.990
No,
no,
you gotta do.
And so that's why I,

123
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.350
I didn't really think that a bare knuckle was going to be that I knew,
uh,

124
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.410
that more,
uh,
intense.
But when I'm seeing some of these matches,

125
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.750
they are a really intense,
but at the end of the day,

126
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:36.170
I think the bottom line is still is the most dangerous weapons,
I think.

127
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:41.090
Where the elbows and knees,
right?
Yeah.
For cuts for sure.
And for damage.

128
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:44.740
I mean,
none of those needs that Jon Jones had a brand new barrel,
windmills,

129
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.350
elbows,
John,
John hit print it for sure.
Yeah.
No,

130
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.560
John's from the mount position from the top.

131
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:55.800
He's got some of the most horrific elbows of all time and not from even from the

132
00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:58.480
hat.
From the guard,
right?
Yeah.
From anywhere.
Yeah.

133
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.180
Remember Tito Ortiz never pass card.
Never pass card.

134
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.300
Just beat everybody up from inside of the guard.
Smashed him from,

135
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:08.090
and he was an expert.
Joe Shillings last fight.

136
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:12.410
He cut that dude up real bad.
All from inside.
The guard was horrible.

137
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:15.070
Ground and pound with his elbows.
Yeah.
Yeah.

138
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.020
But I think for the most damage it's like,

139
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.920
I think it's like a wheel kick to the head.
Yeah.
That's the most,

140
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:24.480
like when you remember when Barboza fought Adam.
Yeah.

141
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.430
That's like the most damage to the wheel kick to the head is,

142
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.400
and that's man that um,
yeah.
Who,
who used to do that?

143
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.810
We'll kick to the head or he just fought,
um,
guy.

144
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:40.730
He's from Canada.
Oh.
From Canada.
He just fought,
but he didn't do a wheel kick.

145
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.640
He didn't do it.
Um,
what was it he said kid,

146
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:48.641
everybody would have spinning back kick and he's a UFC guy or it's for a short

147
00:08:51.641 --> 00:08:55.640
dick guy.
Is it make Dessie John Mick?
Does he?
Yeah.
Mack does.

148
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.420
He's a taekwondo guy.
How many people?

149
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:01.110
He cut a couple of people with spinning back kick around probably.
I mean,

150
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:06.030
he's caught people with a lot of stuff.
He's got a full kicking arsenal.
But yeah,

151
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.230
originally I went to taekwondo background.
Yeah.
Um,
it's,
it's,

152
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.290
it's amazing that you're seeing all these different styles that it's still,

153
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:17.250
even all these years in,

154
00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.220
there's all these different styles of fighting like coke.

155
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.150
They're completely different.

156
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:24.240
You've got like the Ben aspirins style still just grab a hold of him.

157
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.700
You just superior wrestling,
beat his ass.

158
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.930
And then you got style vendor stocked full on,

159
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.340
super technical striker tricking.
You set traps,

160
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.230
you know,
like as a person who loves striking,
like,
uh,
it's a,

161
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.170
it's an interesting time,
you know,
there's so much variety.

162
00:09:43.171 --> 00:09:44.400
There's so much shit going on.

163
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.850
And it's so funny because so many things come back and they go back and forth

164
00:09:47.851 --> 00:09:49.950
and there's all these things that people are telling you,

165
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:52.320
you're not supposed to do this or this isn't going to work.

166
00:09:52.321 --> 00:09:55.020
And then someone comes up and shuts it all down to the end.

167
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:59.070
Now this is going to work.
And so it's,
it's,
it's,
so,
it's always so exciting.

168
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:03.500
How about that Russian dude?
What is his name?
The guy that only neck who oh yeah.

169
00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:07.680
With the fucking,
he gets people to [inaudible] from the mount.

170
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:12.580
Your mounting him and he kills you.
Yeah.
Yeah,
all the time,
right?
Yeah.
Zika,

171
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.680
what amount?
He gets it from,
from your guard.
He's in your garden,
Ezekiel's you.

172
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:21.720
And uh,
he's,
yeah,
and that's exactly the guy.
Like he's that guy who,
who,
uh,

173
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.560
everybody else that is a crazy grip.
The weight does it.

174
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:29.670
You can see how tight it is.
That is amazing that he does,

175
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:34.140
he has gripped like,
no,
cause he,
I mean he,
uh,
he does scarf,

176
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:36.540
chokes the scarf,
whole chokes the people he's done.

177
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:39.840
It took quite a few and I seen he laces it up a little different.

178
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.540
I think he did want to and uh,
but he,

179
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.440
he does stuff that nobody else does.
Carful chokes are legit.

180
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.620
You gotta remember like,
um,
Josh Barnett tapped out.

181
00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:54.090
Dean lister with Chuck.
He,
but he,
I think he's done to people with that.
Right?

182
00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:57.930
He's the,
did that one.
He did one guy in the UFC with it and,
uh,

183
00:10:57.931 --> 00:11:02.540
I think he did it to,
um,
to cro cop.
I've refereed him in Cro,
cop in Russia,

184
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.160
in Moscow.
And He,
uh,
he did on the cro cop.
Yeah.

185
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.580
That scarf all choke.
If you've got a real like you know,
like that guy,

186
00:11:10.581 --> 00:11:13.410
like only nick does that kind of death grip.
Yeah.
Those guys,

187
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:15.570
which brings us to the last fight,
man,

188
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:19.590
that's a death grip that Ben asked her.
If I,
dude,

189
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:21.270
I watched that fight.
Uh,

190
00:11:21.271 --> 00:11:25.800
I've watched that finished like 10 times trying to figure out what happened or

191
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.870
whether it was out or whether it wasn't out.

192
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:33.140
I was pretty convinced that at one point time he went out and then tomorrow

193
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:34.470
Uzman changed my mind.

194
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.950
Camaros [inaudible] showed the that we watched a video tape together.
He's like,

195
00:11:37.951 --> 00:11:41.550
no,
no,
he's giving a thumbs up.
And I'm like,
Shit.
Yeah.
Okay.

196
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:45.200
So I'm still cause the angles I've seen haven't been the best.

197
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.620
I'm trying to see this thumbs up.

198
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.250
Was the thumb going up or was a thumb and a thumbs up position going this way?

199
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.190
Right.
Like on the,
as the arm drops was of the Times.
Okay.
So when I give somebody

200
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:58.030
<v 2>a thumbs up,
like on a,
say somebody got a job.
Good job buddy.
Good job.</v>

201
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.790
That's what,
that's what I want to do.
You know,
so I mean,
I don't know.
Like,

202
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:05.320
I mean I saw one of them's,

203
00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:10.270
nobody's going to know whether he was conscious or unconscious.
What I saw,

204
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:13.480
I saw everything that would indicate I'm seeing that unconscious fighter.

205
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.550
I see an arm go limp for no reason whatsoever.
And um,

206
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.760
so that's what I'm,
that's what I'm have to work with because that's what,

207
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:23.710
you know,
we don't know what someone's feeling word I ever,

208
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:25.360
we just see if they're doing something,

209
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:28.030
it doesn't make sense and you see an arm go limp at that time,

210
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.700
you're going to assume that the person's unconscious.

211
00:12:30.701 --> 00:12:34.300
We assumed it as the broadcast team.
They can hear you guys.
And,
and,

212
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.670
and that I'm supposed to do certain things and like,

213
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:40.870
so here's the thing with that choke,
when I'm refereeing fights,
you know,

214
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:45.430
there's sometimes where,
you know,
some positions or anxiety like,
uh,

215
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.680
you know,
you see two guys going after her leg locks,

216
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:49.840
you see a noodle mess of legs and you know,
you got to,

217
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.620
you're going to have to help one guy out and figuring out who's tapping and make

218
00:12:53.621 --> 00:12:56.800
sure you're on the right arm.
When I see some chokes,
a rear naked choke,

219
00:12:56.801 --> 00:13:00.340
especially the guy in the back face up,
I take a sigh of relief.

220
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:03.310
My job just got so much easier.
This guy,
you know,

221
00:13:03.311 --> 00:13:07.690
it's not like he's going to go out and then a second take some extreme amount of

222
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:11.110
damage.
He may go out,
I'll have a second to make sure you're not even a second,

223
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:15.790
a half a breath to make sure he's okay and then let it go out.

224
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:20.680
And he's not going to take any other damage.
Bulldog choke.

225
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:25.180
We have anytime you have a choke where somebody where there's pressure on the

226
00:13:25.181 --> 00:13:29.230
neck and there's been been in the c spine backwards like that,
that's a,

227
00:13:29.231 --> 00:13:30.610
that's a rough situation for me.

228
00:13:30.611 --> 00:13:34.000
So I see someone go limp and I know that on top of it,

229
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:37.720
they're no longer putting tension on their neck and their neck is just be in
bed.

230
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.090
I can't,
I,
you know,

231
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.390
I can't see that I should do something different than that because that's the,

232
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:46.540
um,
I,
I like to talk to people about this.
I'd like to talk to people.

233
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:48.130
I have opinions about fights,

234
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:51.040
especially people who are interested in who they know what they talking about.

235
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.220
Because if I always have a situation,

236
00:13:54.221 --> 00:13:56.620
if I always have a mindset that I'm always doing the right thing,

237
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:59.470
I can't get better.
So I'm going to have to look at something and say,

238
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.530
was there a teachable moment there?
Is there a way I can learn from this?

239
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.940
And is there a way I could do something different?
And No,
I don't think.

240
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:11.260
I think with that same situation with the arm going limp with that type of a

241
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:14.530
choke on someone,
I don't know of a defense that requires the arm,

242
00:14:14.531 --> 00:14:16.840
you know what I mean?
I would think to arm should be doing something else.

243
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:21.670
I at this time I don't,
um,
I don't see that I should do something different.

244
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.280
You know,
I'm always interested and always looking and always,

245
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.870
I love these types of conversations,
but right now I can't think of,
you know,

246
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.900
they sell you something.
It was an amazing fight.
It was.
Yeah,
it was.
It wasn't,

247
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.220
I mean,
first of all,
it was the first time I seen,
I refereed been asking,

248
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:42.220
I don't think I'd refereed him before.
And you know,
when you're in his PR,

249
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:46.060
his pressure is something special.
It's not the normal.
And,
uh,

250
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.080
the way Robbie dealt with it and Ravi hadn't been,
he hadn't been trouble.

251
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.100
You know,
I was so close to stopping that

252
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.570
<v 0>fight when they're on the ground.
Yeah.
So many times.
Yeah.
With some bombs.
Yeah.</v>

253
00:14:56.571 --> 00:15:00.320
The,
the,
the amount of respect I have for those two athletes,
man.
It's like,

254
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.900
so that's,
so that's the thing is,
you know,

255
00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:06.560
we never want to see anything that could make you have a feeling that it's

256
00:15:06.561 --> 00:15:10.190
inconclusive,
but I can't think of what else I should have done.

257
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.810
But you know,
I mean especially for that,
that fight for those two guys,
you know,

258
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.010
you always want to,
yeah.
The people that have a feeling of conclusion there.

259
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:23.290
Well when we talked about on the phone when you brought up the,
the damage,

260
00:15:23.291 --> 00:15:25.610
the possible damage,
that knack with the bulldog choked,

261
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:30.260
he might be cutting off nerves and you might be bending the spine in a kind of a

262
00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:33.020
fucked up way.
I really hadn't considered that when,

263
00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:35.170
not when I was thinking of the choke,
when he grabbed a hold of them.

264
00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.060
I was just thinking it was a blood choke.
But you're right.

265
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.020
Like the way you lean in on a bulldog choke,
you lean back.
Yeah.

266
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:46.820
So a lot of pressure on the neck.
I've,
I've had,
uh,
some chokes where there,

267
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:49.280
uh,
I've,
I've refereed if I were a guy,

268
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.260
did one of these moves that you had to move for it?

269
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:56.240
A technique where he's been in the spine,
back twister.
It wasn't a twister.

270
00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.640
Um,
the,
I think guys have a name for it.

271
00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:01.790
You probably know the execution or is so that's what it was.
That's what it is.

272
00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.493
Explaining to people.

273
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.530
The what that is is like if a guy is a okay turn not to cut you off.
Okay.

274
00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.520
So for so long I've never really wanted to talk about it because people weren't

275
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.210
doing it.
This was years ago,
I saw it,
but now if there's a name for it,

276
00:16:14.211 --> 00:16:18.230
I guess it's okay.
But you hadn't seen a lot of people doing it before,
right?

277
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.570
Well,
we uh,
we started doing it in 10th planet,
uh,

278
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.810
a few years back.
It's,
I think people have done it.
What it is basically folks,

279
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:28.790
it's like a guillotine from the back.

280
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.690
It's like taking a route you ever like rear naked choke cooks,

281
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.500
but instead of choking guides this way,
which is how you would do it,

282
00:16:36.501 --> 00:16:41.390
which is a wrap your forum underneath his neck and wrap the other arm behind his

283
00:16:41.391 --> 00:16:42.590
head.
Instead of doing that,

284
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:47.000
you wrap your arm all the way around the front like a guillotine hold,

285
00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:51.530
but from the back and you have ungodly leverage.
Right.

286
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.670
It's ungodly.
How much pressure you can put on someone's neck.
And our friends,

287
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.160
Scott Epstein,
he uh,

288
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:01.940
he used quite a few times so we called it the executioner cause that it there,

289
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.330
oh actually I'm trying to find a picture of one.
I know this is,

290
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:10.010
this is the execution or choke.
This is a different choke out.
Uh,

291
00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.540
he calls it the executioner.
I looked that up and nothing came up.
I,
okay.

292
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:18.650
I think I might have a,
have a have it here for you.
The something like this.

293
00:17:18.651 --> 00:17:22.040
This is a little different.
This guy had arms in,
this is different,

294
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.250
but it's similar.
Yeah.
It's similar though.
That's similar.
Yeah.

295
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:30.110
You can have arms in,
yeah.
That's the same thing.
Yeah.
This is it.
That's 100% it.

296
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.250
So,
um,

297
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.200
I dunno what we're going to show people that either way it's a real bad place to

298
00:17:38.601 --> 00:17:42.920
be in because this guy got it.
Yeah,
that's okay.
That's got Epstein,

299
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.320
that's still the north shore south choke.

300
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.520
But what he would do if he wanted to do an execution or is he would get his hips

301
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.140
underneath the guy and get 'em back position.

302
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.510
This is just a really good,
uh,
north south chose.
So yeah.

303
00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:02.040
So what I saw was the guy who went north,
south and he,
ah,

304
00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.450
this was years ago at a king of the cage and,
and way out in Wisconsin.

305
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.410
And he had a,
wow,
this is a long,
long time ago.

306
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.250
He had north south and he sat up once he,

307
00:18:15.251 --> 00:18:17.230
he had the guy,
he sat up and pull it,

308
00:18:17.231 --> 00:18:21.600
the guy's body up onto him and almost a sitting position and then put hooks.

309
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:26.040
And then I've done it before where you all rolled the guy to the side and I'm

310
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:29.460
going just to walk it through and figure out how it worked.
Um,

311
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.000
he put hooks and I was sitting,
I was like,
okay,
this isn't illegal.

312
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.770
If I stop this fight,
it's not,
you know,
or this is not an illegal move,

313
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.480
but I don't want to see how this plays out.

314
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.480
And the guy got one hook in and almost a second hook was about to go in.

315
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.480
The guy tapped and when I pulled him off,
the guy couldn't move.

316
00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.500
His neck was fucked up.
Yeah.
He couldn't move.
Uh,
you know,

317
00:18:52.501 --> 00:18:54.740
he got some sort of standard,
I don't know what's going.
And he was,
he was,

318
00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.510
he couldn't move.
He was terrified.
I was terrified.
And,
uh,

319
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.860
then it kind of,
you know,
uh,
came back and came back and she says,

320
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:04.501
yeah,

321
00:19:04.501 --> 00:19:09.501
I know of several guys that have gotten paralyzed because of a defense,

322
00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:14.430
um,
from a guillotine or take your God now and when the tide,
yeah.
You know,

323
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:17.910
when someone gets you to your team.
Yeah,
I've heard of that.
Yeah.
So,

324
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.920
so that's why with some,
uh,
submissions,
you know,
especially some of the jokes,

325
00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:25.380
it's like,
okay,
things are slowing down and okay,

326
00:19:25.381 --> 00:19:29.010
things are going a little bit easier for me with that when things are not easy

327
00:19:29.011 --> 00:19:32.850
at all.
That's not something that I wanna.
Um,
I want to play.
What I think if,
uh,

328
00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.710
you know,
I've kind of disappointed with some,
some of people have a platform,

329
00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:39.510
I don't want to mention any names,

330
00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:41.790
but some people have a platform of kind of tossed it out.

331
00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:44.940
It was something sensational and say,
Oh,
look at this as it wrong or right.

332
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.490
I think that's a little irresponsible when it's some,
uh,

333
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.380
dangerous techniques like that.
Well,

334
00:19:49.381 --> 00:19:53.110
I think you really pointed that out about the neck and a very important word.

335
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.010
And I think that's something that people should really take into consideration.

336
00:19:56.011 --> 00:19:58.770
When you see someone you've seen people,
uh,

337
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:01.500
have you ever refereed someone regard cotton?
A twister?
Yeah.

338
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.400
It's a horrible place to be.
It,
yeah.
Dot.
So it's a horrible place to be.

339
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.151
It's so your,

340
00:20:06.151 --> 00:20:09.510
your neck is so fucked up and there's so much pressure and the fact that your,

341
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:12.980
that your left leg is isolated and your head's getting pulled through,

342
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:16.080
it feels like it's going to break it to fuck a place would be.

343
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:18.880
Even for the fact of the way it's set up,
because it's not like,
it's,

344
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:23.730
it's not like a fast thing that catches you off guard.
It's a long road to it.
So,

345
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:28.110
you know,
it's coming,
it's coming and you're like,
I'm doing this,

346
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:31.380
but I know how this is going to probably end.
And you're doing some little diff.

347
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:36.000
Yeah.
There's a chance.
I'm Joan Green Zombie.

348
00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.790
I think he got the first ever one on Leonard Garcia.

349
00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:39.830
I think that was the first day we'll get,

350
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:44.460
and that horrible dude that is so that it's so bad.

351
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:48.460
That feels so terrible.
Yeah.
And that,
that's uh,
he,

352
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:49.870
then there's def con four,

353
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.610
you take a rear naked choke grip from the twister position.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Yes.

354
00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.290
That just,
you just rip and dude's heads cleaned off.
It's a horrible,
you know,

355
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.190
all those crazy like catch wrestling,
neck manipulation.
Right,
right,
right.

356
00:21:03.191 --> 00:21:07.840
Those things to make my,
my neck hurt.
Just looking at them.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

357
00:21:07.841 --> 00:21:11.410
So anyway.
Yeah,
that's,
that's why I think,
you know,

358
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:14.170
you can't always say look at things as good or bad,
but you know,

359
00:21:14.171 --> 00:21:17.350
some situations I've seen referees and in that one I think is a difficult

360
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:21.070
situation.
Not so I've seen other harder situations,
but you know what I mean?

361
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.070
Like it's an unusual one.
Yeah.
I mean,

362
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:28.340
we've seen quite a few bulldog chokes that puts someone unconscious.
Uh,

363
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.560
most recently,
uh,
Raquel Pennington against Ashley.
Evan Smith.
Crazy,

364
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.300
crazy fight for cal Pennington.
So fucking tough.
I mean,
that was just,

365
00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:41.050
that was a crazy fight,
Matt.
It's just war and chaos.

366
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:43.780
And then with like one second to go,

367
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:47.110
she chokes her out and then lets her go and she's,

368
00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:51.340
she's asleep from the bulldog choke and Ashley Evan Smith steps up covered in

369
00:21:51.341 --> 00:21:55.390
blood.
I mean,
it's fucking crazy.
That was crazy.

370
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:57.760
But there's that one.
Um,

371
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.810
didn't Chris Lights out Lidell catch Tki in a bull dock choke?

372
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.350
I think he did a voice.
That's the title.
Yeah,

373
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:10.210
that's the,
yeah,
that one that looked really tight.
Yeah.

374
00:22:10.211 --> 00:22:12.170
Go forget that Goto.
Yeah,

375
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:17.180
that's the one that Carlos Newton chokes out pat Miletich cause this was for the

376
00:22:17.861 --> 00:22:21.970
title and he caught him in a bulldog choke and it's like,
that was what that was.

377
00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.350
I don't think we,
we had a name for it.

378
00:22:23.351 --> 00:22:25.480
I think we used to call it a school yard headlock,
but yeah.

379
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:27.850
Then somebody called it a bulldog choke at that time.

380
00:22:27.851 --> 00:22:29.640
I remember people were calling it both.
Oh.

381
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.660
Like they are already had that and I don't know if it had there.

382
00:22:31.661 --> 00:22:36.550
Maybe they gave it to,
but yeah,
it's a legit move.
Like it's a legit move.
Like if,

383
00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.780
especially if you're a band asker type dude,

384
00:22:38.781 --> 00:22:43.030
would that kind of grip someone's neck in that position?
Yeah.
It's horrible.

385
00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:46.030
Yeah.
That was,
um,

386
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.660
that's why I say that referees have the hardest job because you're,

387
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:53.020
you're in that situation.
You do have to take those things into consideration.

388
00:22:53.021 --> 00:22:57.160
What kind of damages is doing to this guy's neck?
Is he out?
His arm went limp.

389
00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.700
Okay.
When do I stop?
I gotta get,
I gotta save him.
Like,
yeah,

390
00:23:00.701 --> 00:23:02.620
know it that that is the tough part about it.
You know,

391
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:06.910
you were evaluating a situation is always there's different,
you know,

392
00:23:06.911 --> 00:23:10.000
and you're evaluating a threat to the person you're evaluating.

393
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:13.030
If there's a threat coming you how much,
how well can they deal with it?

394
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.360
There's a lot of stuff on,
on there and you know,
we take it really serious.

395
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:20.440
I take it really serious.
It's a,
to me it's,
um,
it's a,

396
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:22.600
I feel that I have a sacred trust.

397
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.280
I feel that it's one of these positions that like,
um,

398
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:27.880
our athletes are not stupid people.

399
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.270
A lot of them could be doing a lot of things with their life and they've chosen

400
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:34.090
this path to a,
and they take time from their family,

401
00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:37.750
they take time away from other careers where they could be progressing and all

402
00:23:37.751 --> 00:23:41.290
to meet their dreams and hopes.
And I need to balance that with their safety.

403
00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.890
So it's something I think about a lot,
you know what I mean?
I'm,
I'm a,

404
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.620
even in the way,
uh,
I talked to my friends,
you know what I mean?
To always,
uh,

405
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.980
you know,
I,
I'm always on,
I'm always working as a referee.

406
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.220
Anytime I'm out in the streets are with friends.
People are going to ask me,

407
00:23:55.221 --> 00:23:57.890
what do I think about this fight or who do I think can be better and I,

408
00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.980
because of this job you're doing,
you don't longer have the,

409
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:02.910
the luxury of having eat.

410
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.980
All of talking about mixed martial arts in the fun way about who's going to win

411
00:24:06.981 --> 00:24:09.620
and how's this going to happen?
Because who knows?
I might referee the fight,

412
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.170
right?

413
00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:12.830
And everyone's going to be on the Internet like hers referee in the fight and

414
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:17.570
we're having beers yesterday and guess what he told me.
Ah,
right,
right,
right,

415
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:21.440
right.
Yeah.
It's just,
you know,
so yeah,
I take it serious.
No,
you do it.

416
00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:24.500
I'm glad you have that attitude.
What does this one right here?
Oh yeah,

417
00:24:24.501 --> 00:24:26.920
this is awesome.
This is Carlos right here?
Yeah.
Yeah.

418
00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:31.100
In the transition he grabs the neck and it's a crazy visual too because the

419
00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:34.400
photograph,
the fruit to see the breaks right there,
right there,
I'm dies.

420
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:37.880
It's crazy.
Muscles and Carlos,
his arm and shoulder and neck.

421
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:43.070
Carlos Newton,
champion of the world
right there.

422
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:44.270
That moment and that crazy.

423
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:49.100
Carlos had some spectacular grappling real early on.
Man,

424
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.000
wild transition.
He was amazed.
Jitsu his,
uh,
his,

425
00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.960
his explosiveness is agility.
I mean,
he was just,
he was so athletic.

426
00:24:56.961 --> 00:25:01.010
He was doing stuff that no one else.
Yeah.
He also had a really high level,

427
00:25:01.011 --> 00:25:05.360
a submission game early on.
Yeah.
We're like in 96,
97,

428
00:25:05.361 --> 00:25:07.470
a lot of people didn't have that kind of a game.
And his,

429
00:25:07.471 --> 00:25:11.900
his submission game was tight.
The Matt Hughes one was crazy.
Remember that?
Yeah.

430
00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:12.800
Yeah.
That was crazy.

431
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:17.801
That a triangle choke where he had him up and he puts him to sleep.

432
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.540
And as they get up,
Matt Hughes,
like his,

433
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.400
you hear his car and are saying like,
stand up,
you won.
You won.
He's like,

434
00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:29.180
what happened?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
They'll double knockout.
Yeah.
I have that one.

435
00:25:29.181 --> 00:25:33.170
I have one of the king of the cage,
a double knock out those right here.
This is,

436
00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.990
look how God takes him strong.
He used was,

437
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:39.320
he was so fucking strong that if you build them up there,

438
00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:41.180
<v 3>okay.</v>

439
00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:45.630
<v 0>And Carlos is trying to,
so he's,
he's,
he squeezes,</v>

440
00:25:45.631 --> 00:25:49.070
he squeezes.
So Matt goes unconscious,
he's out cold,

441
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.450
he doesn't know what's going on and no one knows what's going on and they get,

442
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.580
they,
they,
so Carlos,

443
00:25:57.581 --> 00:26:01.240
his head hit the ground when he went down like that and then knocked him out.

444
00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:06.170
Right,
right,
right.
And then Matt woke up from the choke and then like you one go,

445
00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.100
Huh,
look twice.
It's great.

446
00:26:09.101 --> 00:26:12.760
That was a crazy scene that,
that scene was a tough one.
That was like,

447
00:26:12.761 --> 00:26:15.970
what do you do there?
Yeah.
Well that was like the thing about this Robbie Lawler,

448
00:26:15.971 --> 00:26:19.570
Penn Ashkan fight,
like,
Ooh,
mom was saying they got to run it back.

449
00:26:19.571 --> 00:26:24.430
And I was like,
it wouldn't be a bad thing to run it back.
I mean,
well,

450
00:26:24.431 --> 00:26:28.750
at the same time,
you know,
we got to be honest here,
like as far as running back.

451
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:29.910
<v 3>Okay.</v>

452
00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.300
<v 0>How many of the fights is that happened in the UFC?
Are there,</v>

453
00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:37.470
because it's exciting what people want to see.
Yeah,
most.
Right.

454
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:39.980
So Brock Lesnar DC is a perfect example,
right?

455
00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.380
So that's exciting and people want to see it and some of the assignment been

456
00:26:43.381 --> 00:26:44.220
generated by throwing

457
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:49.150
<v 1>me under the bus but code give the people another time.
I'm,
I'm taking,
I got,</v>

458
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.930
but yeah,
no.
So yeah,
I think um,
you know,
anytime that,
you know,

459
00:26:54.931 --> 00:26:58.410
the athletes get to do what they do and people are going to watch it again and

460
00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:01.260
people are going to be excited about it,
you know,
I don't know.

461
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.590
Well I don't think it's going to happen now.

462
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.310
At least not immediately cause a Mazda doll and Ben asked her and have a date

463
00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:12.540
for July.
They're going to do that July show in Vegas.
That's a great fight.

464
00:27:12.541 --> 00:27:17.020
I liked that fight a lot.
Right?
That,
that fights,
that's Mazda Dawson,

465
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:21.450
a new place,
man.
You could really tell he's something special right now.

466
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.690
Here's something really special.
When he knocked out till like that,
I was like,

467
00:27:24.691 --> 00:27:29.430
whoa.
We knocked out cowboy.
It was like,
wow.
Yeah,
no muscle doesn't beast.

468
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.410
He's so good man.

469
00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:35.400
And He seems like extra focused right now.
You know,
like,

470
00:27:35.401 --> 00:27:38.760
I think he's probably like,
what is he 35 somewhere in that range.

471
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.490
How old is his heart or am I swear though,

472
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.880
he's either 34 35 he's coming on to having them on the podcast soon.

473
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.630
It's 35 and November.
Yeah.
So he's at that stage of his career,

474
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.650
um,
where you kind of like,
look man,
how much more time do you got?

475
00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:00.660
Like realistically as a professional mixed martial arts fighter at 35 years of

476
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:03.480
age,
you know,
if you're Anderson Silvia,
you have like three more.

477
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.180
What do you have like three more years of his prime?
Two more years.

478
00:28:06.250 --> 00:28:11.040
Something like that tend to be 38 39 like that's kind of it,

479
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.080
you know,
unless you're doing something,

480
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.740
unless you're doing something to spice up the pot.
All right.
You know,

481
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:21.630
like 40 41 42 man.
Tough.
Tough to compete.

482
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:26.610
Tough to come on the Nache.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

483
00:28:26.611 --> 00:28:31.110
That's a,
that's a whole nother TJ thing is a bummer.
That's a bummer.

484
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.210
If you don't know what we're talking about.

485
00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:37.170
Tj Dillashaw tested positive for injectable EPO,

486
00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:40.830
which is a serious performance enhancing substance.

487
00:28:40.831 --> 00:28:44.700
And in some circumstances,
according to Jeff Novitsky,

488
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.600
it's given people strokes.
Um,
and I had heard this too,

489
00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:52.290
that like young guys doing like Tour de France type shit would have strokes

490
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.410
because they were taking too much apo.
Cause you know,

491
00:28:55.411 --> 00:29:00.090
like if you're supposed to take one,
take two,
fuck it
mentality,

492
00:29:00.091 --> 00:29:05.090
this mentality's anybody who's going to do that,
you know,
I shit turns your,

493
00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:08.000
your,
your blood to paint.
And I think that's what the,

494
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.890
I guess that's probably the discipline might have helped people were always

495
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:14.470
getting away with things beforehand,
right.
Is to try to,
uh,

496
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.610
maybe try to do it in a way where they,
uh,
won't get caught.

497
00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:21.480
But I think that's like,
it will have this much is good then.
Yeah.

498
00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:23.520
This is much more,
it's going to be better.
And,
yeah,

499
00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:25.920
and we know guys who've done that with TRT.
You know,

500
00:29:25.921 --> 00:29:29.790
there was a few TRT tests where they,
when TRT was legal,

501
00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:32.160
testosterone replacement therapy,
um,

502
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:36.990
where you would hear about guys tested in like 14 hundreds,
14,
70,
like,

503
00:29:36.991 --> 00:29:39.440
which is insane.
It's like superhuman.

504
00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.340
No person's ever lived that as 1400,
uh,

505
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:47.830
like as a natural walking around testosterone level.
That's crazy.
Hyper human.

506
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:51.550
But they just get these benefits from that with some of these people though who

507
00:29:51.551 --> 00:29:55.090
walk around naturally.
I wonder if they'd never been tested though.
That's true.

508
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.870
Some of these people I see walking around like genetic freaks.
They do.

509
00:29:58.871 --> 00:30:02.200
Looks like he was born on Stuart's.
Yeah,
there are some freaks,
man.

510
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.430
There's some legit genetic freaks to deny.
That would be crazy.

511
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:10.810
There's some people that just like,
Yo all Ramiro,
what in the fuck?

512
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.210
It doesn't matter how many steroids you take.

513
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:16.930
It doesn't matter what you do like to do look like that.

514
00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:21.160
You have to be a genetic freak and they're out there walking around.

515
00:30:21.161 --> 00:30:23.290
It's not fair.
Well Yo,
I was talking about,

516
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:28.490
he was saying go to Cuba genes.
Go see the jeans.
Yeah.

517
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:31.720
Little Cuba look around.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Mom

518
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.640
fight or from France to heavyweight.
From France.

519
00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:39.100
I mean he presents in Ghana for Francis.

520
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:42.530
And who wasn't a guy who used to be the one who had the,

521
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.290
the crazy fat would pat pat Barry.
Oh,
he checked Congo check Congo.

522
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:50.950
Adonis sculpted Greek statue.

523
00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.610
He's just always imagine like I want to go to where he comes from.

524
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.750
Just take a look around.
Probably super athletes.
Probably a lot of eaters.

525
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:04.960
Um,
the TJ thing,
apparently they went and tested his old fight.

526
00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:09.760
A piss with Cody too.
And that tested positive for EPO as well.

527
00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:14.050
And then Cody start freaking out.
Yeah,
that's right.
What do you do if they,

528
00:31:14.051 --> 00:31:17.680
if they go back,
like what if they decided to go back,
hey and say,
fuck it,

529
00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:22.420
let's test all the fights and it finds out that he was doing it like five,

530
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:26.250
six,
seven fights.
What do you do?
Well,
yeah.

531
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.460
Then what do you do if you,
uh,
but then it's a whole nother can of worms too.

532
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.820
Because like all the fights and then what about all because right,

533
00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.710
like when we get to test everybody chaplain's job and I were joking around last

534
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.050
night and I was like test them all and he's going,

535
00:31:41.051 --> 00:31:45.130
no one task him all test everything.
Let's find out,

536
00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.220
let's know what it was,
let's know what it was.
And he's like,

537
00:31:48.221 --> 00:31:53.200
what if they had pissed samples from you know,
10 years ago,

538
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.310
15 years ago?

539
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.440
Like what if they could use Usada style testing today from the past.

540
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:05.030
I'm so glad that all these things are above my pay grade to deal with that.
Yeah.

541
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.980
Yeah.
I mean if I was the guys in the office right now,

542
00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:11.950
the in charge of that program,

543
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.380
you have to really wonder where is the line.

544
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.380
You certainly want to test to guy for a fight that happened a week ago.

545
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.330
You certainly want to hold,

546
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:22.900
you know and check is if some new testing methods come out.

547
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:26.080
If there was a fight from a year ago,
you certainly would check that.

548
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:31.270
How many years back do you go though?
Yeah.
Especially if it's not expensive.
Like,

549
00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:36.271
what if it's easy and cheap to do a test run 500 tests on the last 500

550
00:32:36.911 --> 00:32:40.010
championship fights and then you have like 400 fights

551
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.810
<v 0>that you now have to like change the result of
yeah,</v>

552
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.010
I dunno.
I Dunno either.
Last night I was joking,

553
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.550
I was saying test them all.
I was taking the,

554
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:56.880
the fun position test them all.
I don't know about,

555
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:58.790
I mean look,

556
00:32:58.791 --> 00:33:03.440
we all know at one point in time performance enhancing drugs were a huge part of

557
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:07.670
mixed martial arts and that's why the UFC stepped up and decided to institute

558
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:09.110
this program.
It was a big part of it.

559
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:14.050
I think it's a big part of professional sports in general.
Sure.
100%.
Yeah.

560
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.680
And I think that,
um,
you know,
uh,
combat sports,
you know,

561
00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.980
has a government oversight that other sports don't have.

562
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.440
So I think that were con we're going to be,

563
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.780
it's going to be coming up regardless anyway.
So I think maybe that's why the,

564
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:31.130
you know,
the UFC took a position,
right?
Because I think of the other sports.

565
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.470
I mean guys,
you get caught doing things,

566
00:33:33.471 --> 00:33:37.700
but a lot of the other sports regulate themselves,
right?
Yeah.
I don't know.

567
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.750
I think the NFL regulates itself.
What did this Court House,
what are the sport,

568
00:33:41.751 --> 00:33:45.590
has a government body like athletic commission saying,
Hey,

569
00:33:45.591 --> 00:33:48.130
we're going to show up and do this or do that.
I don't know.

570
00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:51.410
Like what do they do with baseball?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Maybe.
I don't know.

571
00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:55.130
I don't know much about other sports,
but I didn't.
I remember,
I've never heard,

572
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:58.250
I've never heard of like a,
we all know about we,

573
00:33:58.251 --> 00:34:01.490
you know that's something different.
Our support is that the government involved

574
00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.030
<v 4>commission would not,
not it,
not like he's seen a government commission,</v>

575
00:34:05.031 --> 00:34:08.620
but they just,
yeah,
take revenue themselves.
A NFL would have a vote.

576
00:34:08.621 --> 00:34:11.140
They hand down a suspension.
They're not fair from this.

577
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:14.350
This guy suspension at that guy's suspension and baseball.

578
00:34:14.351 --> 00:34:15.670
They have like a three strike rule,

579
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:19.150
like the first time it's like somewhere in the 10 to 25 game range and then the

580
00:34:19.151 --> 00:34:21.190
second one is like half the season.
Third one,

581
00:34:21.450 --> 00:34:23.410
you're out for a whole year and if you do it again,
your band.

582
00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:23.651
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

583
00:34:23.651 --> 00:34:28.651
but there's no outside Ghana shows up and decides to just at the baseball or NFL

584
00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:31.130
and basketball on the side.

585
00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.850
You have a big moneymaker in your sport and then somebody outside of your

586
00:34:36.851 --> 00:34:39.790
company just comes along and says,
yeah,
I'm,
I'm a government by,

587
00:34:39.791 --> 00:34:42.880
they have the right to test this guy.
Yeah.
Like what happened with John Jones?

588
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:46.150
Yeah.
I mean that's,
that's a perfect example.

589
00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.450
I mean the UFC did not want John Jones to test positive.

590
00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:54.870
He is the biggest star right now other than Connor and Connor is not active and

591
00:34:55.271 --> 00:34:57.130
Jon Jones is fighting all the time.

592
00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.960
He wants to fight all the time that if the that's,

593
00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.120
but that's the only way you ever find out what's really going on is you hire a

594
00:35:04.121 --> 00:35:08.950
bunch of werewolves and they just let them loose.
Right.
Go check,

595
00:35:08.951 --> 00:35:13.060
Piss,
go,
go out there,
check,
check everyone.

596
00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:14.350
They checked the shit out of people.

597
00:35:14.351 --> 00:35:18.400
I was looking at this list of people that Holly Holmes been tested more than

598
00:35:18.401 --> 00:35:21.640
like I think,
I think Novitsky might've put it,
oh,

599
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:25.930
Steve Bay meo chick tweeted it because he'd been tested 38 times.
Really?
Yeah.

600
00:35:25.931 --> 00:35:30.460
Some people,
it's like in the forties,
cris Cyborg got tested a lot.
Yeah.

601
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.840
And Holly Holm got tested a lot,
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Holly Holm got tested a lot.

602
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.130
A lot of people got tested.
Um,
it's

603
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:42.060
<v 1>just a crazy numbers and a lot of them,</v>

604
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:46.320
I guarantee they're waking them up.
Yeah.
Know,
get 'em up like six in the morning.

605
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.580
This what I've heard,
I mean,
I don't know what they go by.

606
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:52.420
I've heard conversations a little bit.
It doesn't seem like it's all,

607
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.260
they want to make sure you're there so that you get there really early in the

608
00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:58.380
morning and fucked up.
You're supposed to tell him where you're supposed to,

609
00:35:58.381 --> 00:36:00.180
where you're going to be at and think,
yeah.
Yeah.

610
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.440
The problem is if you're training hard,
that eight to 10 is so huge.

611
00:36:04.441 --> 00:36:08.640
You might get hit with a punch if they wake you up after like six hours or five

612
00:36:08.641 --> 00:36:09.210
hours.

613
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:13.260
It's possible that a punch might connect on you that wouldn't have connected.

614
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:16.830
If you've got eight that's not,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's,
that's real.
That's real.

615
00:36:16.831 --> 00:36:21.150
That's real.
Everybody knows how you feel good in the gym and everybody,

616
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.790
even if you just lift weights,
there's days you feel good.

617
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:26.190
There's days you feel like crap.
I made sure I showed up here.
Well rested.

618
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:30.840
You look well rested and I'm hydrated when we get back.
I did.
I did hydrate.

619
00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.490
Yeah.
I Dunno.
It's just,
it's,

620
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:40.050
it's just not smart to stop athletes in the middle of their training camp at

621
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:41.060
wake him up.
Yeah.

622
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.580
I mean I get the testing but I feel like the testing so sophisticated,

623
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.780
you could get to them at noon.
Okay.
Just so you could get to them at noon.

624
00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.130
You got good testing now just so we don't we,
I mean I don't know that.

625
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:56.160
I don't know that either.
I'm talking shit cause I think the best time,

626
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:00.930
the best time is that,
you know,
maybe at the earliest earlier the better.
Right?

627
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.080
Maybe I don't know the thing about this EPO apparently,

628
00:37:04.081 --> 00:37:06.660
and this is what a Shahbaz telling me was that they didn't,

629
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.330
it didn't used to be a detectable,
uh,
the way it is now.
They've,

630
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.400
they've got these new methods of detection and a eps want to that apparently

631
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:20.670
from what I've read,
don't listen to me.
I'm not a doctor.
Um,

632
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:24.660
they can absolutely tell that you injected it.
It's uh,

633
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:28.170
it's injectable,
it comes in the injectable form.
That's what's in the body.

634
00:37:28.171 --> 00:37:33.030
So it was no chance of a tainted steroid or tainted a supplement.
Right,
right.

635
00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:37.710
It's definitely EPO.
So that's,
that's fucked up.

636
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.780
Cause apparently that stuff has a giant advantage.
Um,

637
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:42.660
it gives you an anabolic advantage.

638
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.140
It also gives you crazy recoup recuperative powers.

639
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.260
So like you could train really hard and then be ready to go the next day.

640
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.110
What do you think the answer is?
Because like for me,

641
00:37:52.111 --> 00:37:54.600
like this is all stuff that like,
to be honest,

642
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:59.240
I don't really pay that much attention to it because I don't have,
I lost them.

643
00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:03.360
It's out of my wheelhouse to deal with.
But also it's hard to have an answer.

644
00:38:03.361 --> 00:38:04.051
Like you said,
it's like,

645
00:38:04.051 --> 00:38:06.780
do we go back and keep testing them when these new things coming and says,

646
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:10.530
what do we do with the history tall?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just,
it's very interesting,

647
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:13.320
you know?
Yeah.
What do you do with the history books?
That's what you'd say.

648
00:38:13.321 --> 00:38:15.570
Look at what point if,
if you have samples,

649
00:38:15.571 --> 00:38:19.410
the date back 10 years to you do chest them all,
like what do you do?

650
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.410
I don't know.
I don't know how long they keep samples or how,

651
00:38:22.411 --> 00:38:27.110
who has them or how they,
you know,
what's the chain of command?
Um,

652
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:29.580
I don't know man.
It's just,

653
00:38:29.581 --> 00:38:33.430
but if you find out that TJ tested positive for the Cody fight to,
well,

654
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.970
Cody shirt has an argument there.
And what if it's the fight before that,

655
00:38:36.971 --> 00:38:39.790
what have you,
there's a lot of that was,
a lot of people have arguments.

656
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:42.610
There's a lot of guys.
Yeah.
So it's,
yeah,
it's a tough,

657
00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:47.611
to me it's a shame too because I'm a Tj fan and I think he's a phenomenal

658
00:38:47.771 --> 00:38:52.210
fighter and,
uh,
I,
um,
I'm a big fan of watching him perform.

659
00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:57.620
Um,
but just,
it taints his legacy.
It just does.
There's no way around it when,

660
00:38:57.690 --> 00:39:02.470
when you get caught cheating,
which is this stuff is,

661
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:06.430
does no way.
It's not cheating.
I mean,
this is just cheating,
right?
I mean,

662
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:10.590
this isn't any accident.
It taints your legacy.
Right.

663
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:14.950
And the guy had an amazing legacy,
you know,
two times bantamweight champion,

664
00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.660
one of the best pound for pound fighters,

665
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:19.600
the way he beat him and Barao I was like,
Holy Shit.

666
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:22.960
So he went out and fought Hanan Barao he was sparring with,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

667
00:39:22.961 --> 00:39:27.700
His stuff to stuff.
Some of his fights were amazing.
He's amazing.
Again,

668
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.510
it doesn't take away from the fact that he's amazing.
Tj did an amazing fighter,

669
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.220
but fuck man,

670
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.510
that to test positive for EPO and Henry.

671
00:39:37.511 --> 00:39:40.660
So Hutto foreigners is also crazy to watch the progression,

672
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.380
all the work he did and how much,
you know,
he was getting better every fight.

673
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.010
And so yeah,
but you've got to think like how much,

674
00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.540
like if you're on EPO,

675
00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:54.040
how much does that really allow you to train extra time?

676
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.650
How much does that allow you to recover?
What's the benefit?

677
00:39:56.651 --> 00:39:58.510
Like what is the quantifiable benefit?

678
00:39:58.511 --> 00:40:03.190
It must be pretty significant because there's a lot of,
you know,
the cyclists,

679
00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:05.860
a lot of,
lot of heavy duty endurance athletes use it.

680
00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:09.520
I almost want to try it,
you know,

681
00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:12.640
they say that these executives are trying it.

682
00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:16.750
They're doing EPO and entering into triathlons and shit like that.

683
00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.730
For bragging rights.
Yeah,
just assholes.
Assholes with money or taking EPO.

684
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:26.320
Like really I was reading the thing about an epidemic of a really a boost to

685
00:40:26.321 --> 00:40:27.220
that much like okay,

686
00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:29.650
you're going to take it and you're going to notice that you're able to like,

687
00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.920
like the other day you could barely finish a role,

688
00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:36.100
a loop around the rose bowl at three mile loop and then you started taking it

689
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:40.150
and you're good.
Get what,
five,
six miles.
And I wonder,
I wonder,

690
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:43.630
I think what it does is it raises your threshold if you're already an elite

691
00:40:43.631 --> 00:40:46.720
endurance athlete too.
I think for them that's what it is.

692
00:40:46.721 --> 00:40:48.550
It's like they're already looking for that extra edge.

693
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.910
So they're already an elite endurance athletes are already in the Tour de France

694
00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:56.550
and they take that APL and it's like,
well,
why just just Jackson mom.

695
00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.180
They could just do more work.
They have more oxygen,
they don't run out of juice.

696
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:06.160
And for a guy like Tj,
his style,
so kinetic,
there's so much movement,
explosion,

697
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:11.230
swimsuits,
dances,
like he needs that juice.
It's not like a calm,

698
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:15.550
easy game where he's,
you know,
everything's fast,
fast,
fast,
fast,
fast.

699
00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:21.670
It's crazy.
It's hard.
It's,
it's a hard one to swallow.
Yeah,
man.

700
00:41:21.671 --> 00:41:23.560
So for me,
like I was like,
man,

701
00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.680
I was going to come on Joe Rogan's show and let's see,
what was he?

702
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:28.660
Could he talk about to make me uncomfortable,

703
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:32.850
to talk about maybe some hearts stoppages,
man.
I either talk about some hearts,

704
00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:33.893
but just

705
00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.260
<v 2>give me what's the worst,
well,
let me talk about what I made a mistake.</v>

706
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:40.250
I don't want to talk about this

707
00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.610
because I know I have no answer for it.
I don't understand that.
It's like,
oh,

708
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:47.463
I'd wanted,
like,

709
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:51.110
I just doesn't feel like a good conversation because all I could do is just,

710
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:52.640
it just get,
like you said,

711
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:57.200
it's just going to take away from what I've seen of Aza ends and the more I

712
00:41:57.201 --> 00:41:58.100
imagine about it,

713
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:02.840
it's just going to be more takeaway and then anything I could say or think
about,

714
00:42:02.841 --> 00:42:04.720
I can't think of anything that's solution

715
00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:09.640
<v 1>or our system.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I don't think anybody,</v>

716
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.780
I think we're in this stage right now where they're probably looking at the data

717
00:42:13.781 --> 00:42:18.190
going,
okay,
what does this signify and how many more people should we test?

718
00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.610
You know,
once,
once they develop a new method of testing,

719
00:42:21.611 --> 00:42:25.150
that's the whole reason why they want to keep the old samples anyway in case
new,

720
00:42:25.151 --> 00:42:28.570
more sensitive methods of detect him.
Right.
Or invented

721
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:30.590
<v 2>about this stuff.
Cause I know the true,</v>

722
00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:33.900
you're a science freak and you're a scientist.

723
00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.420
Investi dark,
especially when it comes to,
uh,

724
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:42.090
anything that can enhance the,
this life that we have on this earth.
So yeah,
I'm

725
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:43.860
<v 1>sure you know a lot about this stuff.
Well,</v>

726
00:42:43.861 --> 00:42:48.861
I've had a really amazing conversation with many people about it and uh,

727
00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.190
David Sinclair was one of the more recent ones who did,
uh,

728
00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:58.840
just discussion about life extension and different,
uh,
anti aging,

729
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.710
uh,
solutions and different things that they're coming up with.

730
00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:07.430
But what I've come through with is at the end of the end is there are probably

731
00:43:08.971 --> 00:43:13.971
hundreds of thousands of people that are involved in either legitimate

732
00:43:15.031 --> 00:43:20.031
supplements or legitimate molecules or testing hormones on people or,

733
00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:22.381
you know,

734
00:43:22.381 --> 00:43:26.460
trying all these different things to try to figure out how to get the body to

735
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:27.510
perform better.

736
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.410
Some of them are legal and some of them are illegal and that's where it gets

737
00:43:31.411 --> 00:43:35.190
strange.
She get like the guy like the ball co guy Vic to contact comes along.

738
00:43:35.191 --> 00:43:37.980
It's like,
look,
I got,
why don't you just rub it on?
No one's going to know shit.

739
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:41.730
They don't know what this stuff is yet.
And for a while yet that worked.

740
00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.720
And then,
but,
but,
but wild worked.
Everybody's like,

741
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:50.310
why is Barry bonds getting so big?
You know,
people just started wrecking like,

742
00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.480
come on man,
look at me.
Sammy Sosa looking at me in the eye.

743
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.330
What are you doing?
You know?
And they all,

744
00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.770
they all like exhibited these obvious physiological changes were that you could

745
00:44:01.771 --> 00:44:04.230
tell them whatever they were doing was really effective stuff.

746
00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.080
There's hundreds of thousands of people working on that right now.

747
00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:09.960
All the time on all the time trying to get it better.

748
00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:13.020
There's probably thousands of people that are trying to come up with stuff that

749
00:44:13.021 --> 00:44:16.710
sneaks past this testing,
you know?
Did you ever see,
I'm so,

750
00:44:16.711 --> 00:44:18.680
I just stick to Bikram Yoga,
man.
It's a good move.

751
00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:23.880
Did you ever see that ICARUS documentary?
I think I did.
It was about who?

752
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:28.660
It was a,
the Russian.
A doe anti dog.
Did you see that one?

753
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:33.690
I didn't see that.
It's amazing.
It's amazing.
The guy who made the documentary,

754
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:35.820
the whole thing sort of happened by accident.

755
00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.180
So a guy named Bryan Fogel and his um,

756
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.430
his documentary was on,

757
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.460
he was going to do a bike race and then he was going to come back the next year

758
00:44:47.311 --> 00:44:50.730
and do the bike race on steroids and see what the difference was.

759
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.420
And so he was going to document it all and he was going to have this Russian

760
00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.260
anti-doping guy.
Um,

761
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.540
this guy was going to oversee his program,

762
00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:02.930
tell them what to take and how much to take and when to take,

763
00:45:02.931 --> 00:45:06.210
make sure he doesn't get cut.
It was no,
yeah,
make sure he didn't get caught.

764
00:45:06.211 --> 00:45:07.440
That was one of them I think.

765
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.200
I don't think they drug tested most of the things that he was interested in

766
00:45:10.201 --> 00:45:11.910
doing.
I think the thing he was doing,

767
00:45:11.911 --> 00:45:14.040
he just wanted to see how good he could get.
Okay.

768
00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.790
Cause you said antivirus and anti doping gun.
This is,
this is why,

769
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:21.150
this is where it gets too.
In the middle of him doing this,

770
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.760
this Russian anti-doping guy,

771
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:29.060
it comes out that the Russians cheated at the Sochi Olympics and this Russian

772
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:34.070
anti-doping guy spills the beans to this guy and explains the Russian state

773
00:45:34.381 --> 00:45:39.360
sponsored doping program that they state sponsored and doped all their athletes

774
00:45:39.361 --> 00:45:42.690
that everyone was on steroids and that they hid the urine.

775
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.460
They had two separate legal like you let a Sebring secrets separate room where

776
00:45:47.461 --> 00:45:51.360
they transferred the dirty urine through a hole in the wall and slipped out the

777
00:45:51.361 --> 00:45:53.940
good urine.
They put it back in place so they,

778
00:45:53.941 --> 00:45:57.750
they substituted clean urine for the year and that was collected.

779
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.460
They opened up the bottles.

780
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.580
They found these microscopic scratches on the supposedly on OpenTable cap these

781
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:08.550
bottles,
but they ran them under microscopes.
They like look,
they were scratched.

782
00:46:08.551 --> 00:46:09.840
These,
these things had been open.

783
00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:13.140
The Russians had figured out a way to open the bottle without cracking the seal.

784
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:15.990
Did they?
They swapped piss.
I mean,

785
00:46:15.991 --> 00:46:20.991
it was like super sophisticated stuff and this guy details all of it by accident

786
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.330
just because he had hired this guy to give him drugs so he could,

787
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.540
he was just trying to run a document.
It,

788
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:29.730
let's see how much better steroids make me at riding the bike.

789
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:32.190
And when all this stuff broke,

790
00:46:32.191 --> 00:46:35.040
he just came in at the right place at the right time.
And it's amazing.

791
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:37.530
It's amazing.
That's why Russia one,

792
00:46:37.531 --> 00:46:39.810
like all these gold medals in the Sochi Olympics,

793
00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.680
there were all Jews to the tits.
And you're saying all of them,
Huh?
Yes.

794
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.050
It's just for me,
like it's,
it's just,

795
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:49.140
it's one of those things like I just don't have no help and answer to it.

796
00:46:49.141 --> 00:46:52.350
I know there's always going to be people who are going to look for an advantage

797
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.310
and I think as long as some,
but there's one person looking for an advantage,

798
00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:57.503
then,
uh,

799
00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.900
I think there's some people are going to have the attitude that if there's an

800
00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:03.310
advantage out there,
I'm a fool for not taking it.
Uh,

801
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:06.240
the people who don't take it or people who are,

802
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.040
are gifted in some way or have just had a work ethic that goes beyond and it's a

803
00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:13.170
matter of pride that they don't do it.
You know what I mean?

804
00:47:13.171 --> 00:47:14.550
Like when you're a sharp kid,
you don't,

805
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:16.750
it's like a matter of pride to never cheat on a test.

806
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.800
Whereas some people that's their go to,
you know?
Yeah.
It's,
it's interesting.

807
00:47:19.801 --> 00:47:23.790
It's like what is,
what's legal and what's not legal?

808
00:47:23.791 --> 00:47:25.350
Like what should you be allowed to do?

809
00:47:25.351 --> 00:47:27.580
You should you be allowed to use cryotherapy.

810
00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.040
What if it turns out the crowd ramps up

811
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.880
<v 0>your hormones would,</v>

812
00:47:30.881 --> 00:47:35.500
if it turns out the cryotherapy speeds up your recovery that's commensurate with

813
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.370
a steroid.
But why shouldn't you be able to use it?
You should be able to,

814
00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:39.971
but I'm just,

815
00:47:39.971 --> 00:47:43.090
I'm just saying cause I think the basis of the is that some of these other

816
00:47:43.091 --> 00:47:46.540
things are supposed to be maybe dangerous for you.
EPSS sure.

817
00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.010
That that's the reason that's the base that I don't know if that,

818
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.060
but I think that's our base reasoning.
Right.

819
00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.490
I think the base reasoning is cheating.
Well,
no,

820
00:47:54.491 --> 00:47:59.110
not just cheating because it's not cheating if everyone's doing it well for

821
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:01.570
sure.
I mean,
so they're supposed to be dangerous stuff,

822
00:48:01.571 --> 00:48:04.780
so like you don't even know.
But I'm talking about hormone.

823
00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:08.860
Like you can use vitamins or anything or you can have good nutrition.

824
00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.770
It's that makes anti anything that's gonna make you better at what you're doing.

825
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.790
But there's ones that we don't want people to use because they're dangerous to

826
00:48:15.791 --> 00:48:19.330
use for those reasons is the,
I think that's supposed to be the reason,
right?

827
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:22.120
I do not know if that reason makes sense.

828
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.010
I know not saying whether it makes sense or not,

829
00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.290
but I think that's supposed to be the cause we were,

830
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.450
where are they going to come?
When does it come down and say,
well,

831
00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.420
we don't want you using any artificial supplements,
vitamins.

832
00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:33.340
We want you to get all your vitamins from your food.

833
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.640
What you're doing is you're getting some of your vitamins artificially and it's

834
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:37.990
not the way human being gets it.

835
00:48:37.991 --> 00:48:41.980
So like there's a line that's being drawn somewhere and I'm saying the line is

836
00:48:41.981 --> 00:48:44.320
being drawn at what is supposed to be saved.

837
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:49.321
One at one point it got drawn at that and then became something else.

838
00:48:49.511 --> 00:48:52.720
Maybe.
I don't know if they were really concerned with safety,

839
00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:56.530
they wouldn't let them fight or we're not talking about Tom about all sports.

840
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.020
I know,
but I mean,
especially like with fighting,

841
00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:02.710
if you're really concerned with safety,
let's just cancel the whole event.

842
00:49:02.770 --> 00:49:07.420
Like someone's gonna get hurt.
Well,
there's a lot of things I said,

843
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.290
you know that we don't like to fighters to jump on the top of the cage who,

844
00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:14.620
because
they were just kicking each other,
kicking each other in the face.

845
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.070
But yeah,
yeah,
no,
get off.
Get down off of that.
Kay,

846
00:49:18.071 --> 00:49:22.040
are you doing up there celebrating a bad day?
Yeah,

847
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:23.940
the celebrating thing is funny man.

848
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:26.950
Let them celebrate and they don't like him to do a flip.
Well,
one guy,

849
00:49:27.850 --> 00:49:30.340
he did a flip and landed on one guy did a flip and landed on someone.

850
00:49:30.341 --> 00:49:34.090
So I get that.
But it's like,
man,
I trust the guy to get kicked in the neck,

851
00:49:34.091 --> 00:49:36.910
but I'm not going to trust him to do a flip.
He's probably done a flip before.

852
00:49:36.911 --> 00:49:41.680
I Dunno.
Yeah,
I dunno.
Either Gates.
He almost landed on a guy his last fight.
Yeah,

853
00:49:41.681 --> 00:49:45.280
and that's what that somebody else gets hurt now.
Now I get that.

854
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.710
What if he killed a doctor?
Who knows how long?

855
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.410
How much of a suspension do you get if you kill a doctor with a backflip?

856
00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:55.540
Like for real,
I imagine the doctors running in and just going there to help.

857
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:56.490
Dang.

858
00:49:57.230 --> 00:50:02.230
It would be the ultimate worldstar video de de Beast would,

859
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:06.250
would uh,
Derek Lewis,
would he have that on his Instagram?

860
00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:11.560
What do you keep them as Instagram?
If someone died,
it was a UFC,
he might,

861
00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:16.030
he's so savage.
His Instagram is pretty funny in the game.

862
00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.110
If you want to see,

863
00:50:17.111 --> 00:50:20.500
I saw one the other day of a guy on a motorcycle on his Instagram,

864
00:50:20.501 --> 00:50:22.450
drove right into a fucking telephone.

865
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:25.540
Paul Guy wasn't paying attention or something.

866
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:30.190
He went off the side of the road and a fucking telephone pole full on.
Oh.

867
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:38.000
Oh.
Just slammed into this poll like,
fuck man,
I got to stay off.
Derrick's good.

868
00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:41.750
No,
I don't like to watch that kind of stuff.
Yeah,
yeah.
You know,

869
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:43.250
like that guy's never going to be the same.

870
00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:45.860
He's either dead or he's never going to be the same.
Yeah.

871
00:50:45.861 --> 00:50:49.730
That's the one I saw was that one where saw that guy was going to do a jump off

872
00:50:49.731 --> 00:50:53.490
a house and two of Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And you don't know what happened,
man.

873
00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.490
That guy's got to be dead.
A lot of them are dead.
I'm mad,
man.

874
00:50:57.491 --> 00:51:00.200
I just got something on my Instagram about the guy who got hit by a dolphin.

875
00:51:00.201 --> 00:51:02.510
I just put that up there the day I saw somebody put it up.

876
00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:03.920
Can I get hit by a dolphin?
Yeah.

877
00:51:03.921 --> 00:51:07.700
He was doing some paddle boarding as a dolphin was living life a little bit.

878
00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:10.550
Dolphin was doing,
the sticks are there.
You know how the paddle board down,

879
00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.160
there's a wave coming and then you can see the dolphins.

880
00:51:13.161 --> 00:51:14.900
You know they like to surf,
so they get in the wave,

881
00:51:14.901 --> 00:51:17.120
they're doing their thing and I think the dolphin sees him.

882
00:51:17.121 --> 00:51:20.150
He's the only one who decides to come out of the water and get a little air.

883
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:24.440
He's like,
oh,
it was a paddle boarder.
Get a little air bow and he fucks him up.

884
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:28.820
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Here we go.
Whoa,
let me this backer.
Oh,

885
00:51:28.821 --> 00:51:33.400
that's 100% on purpose.
Like it makes you wonder about dolphins like a dog.

886
00:51:33.401 --> 00:51:37.730
I was like,
oh,
what an opportunity.
It is.
100% on purpose.
Yeah.
I had to,

887
00:51:37.731 --> 00:51:41.070
I had to put that.
I had to post that on Instagram.
That guy's all right.

888
00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.970
He's already dead.
He fell in the water.
He fell in the water.

889
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:48.230
But a dolphin's heavy.
Yeah,
I checked.
She's got a little side chat.

890
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:51.020
What do you do in that moment?
Do you hit him?
Do you hit the Dolphin?

891
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:54.550
Do you punch it?
You know,
I have respect.
I know.
No been trying to fuck you.

892
00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:59.090
I'm like,
the Dolphin got the air.
I'm like,
Hey,
you're having a little fun.
Yeah.

893
00:51:59.091 --> 00:52:02.750
Cause how much did the dolphin way and it's his element.
It's a big animal.
Yeah.

894
00:52:02.751 --> 00:52:05.210
You've got to get back to the shore.
That is pretty funny though.
Yeah.

895
00:52:05.211 --> 00:52:09.440
Walked out one off,
walked that when
you know,
you know,

896
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.900
elbow it as it's coming and you don't want to piss him off.

897
00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:16.640
You're in their neighborhood
and this is,

898
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:20.480
that's clearly on purpose.
Yeah.
Let's clear that.
It was like,
you fucking dumb.

899
00:52:20.481 --> 00:52:22.760
He's get out of the way,
bitch.
What are you doing?

900
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:27.350
You're not even surfing paddle boarding panelists.

901
00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:32.570
Surprising you hard.
I wonder if his friends laughed the other dolphins.
Yeah,

902
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:37.370
he's talking to us.
They probably thought it was awesome.
Yeah,
yeah,

903
00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:41.750
yeah.
I went paddle boarding.
It's not easy.
I didn't think it was hard.

904
00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:46.200
Did you stand?
He was standing straight like this.
You don't have to go.

905
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:50.600
That was hard.
There was a lot of waves.
It was a,
it was a little,

906
00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:53.570
was a little walkway,
but I was like,
I thought this would be way easier.

907
00:52:53.900 --> 00:52:54.830
I fell twice.

908
00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:01.760
She was making fun of me.
Stop it,
Bro.
Yeah.

909
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:06.560
I'm paddleboarding.
Um,
is one of those things where it's like,

910
00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:11.140
Eh,
it's just used mostly easier core,
right.
You're bouncing it.
Yeah.
I mean,

911
00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.360
I'm not an expert at it.
I did it once or twice when I was in Hawaii,
you know,

912
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.200
hanging out with the fam.
I'm stuck.
If you got like placid water,

913
00:53:18.201 --> 00:53:22.460
it actually calming Paddle Board.
You ever surf?

914
00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:26.020
I've trying.
I'm going to be sad.
I'm going to do it this year.
This is to get

915
00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:30.180
<v 2>some lessons,
taking some lessons and did a little bit.
I have,
I've,
I've been,
uh,</v>

916
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:33.170
up on some way of the water was pushing me,
but I can't,
I'm under,

917
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:37.890
can't call it surfing what I was doing,
but I was in the water.

918
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:41.790
I was having fun.
That's a respectable thing to know how to do.
Right.

919
00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:44.670
When you hear someone can serve like,
ah,
well,
no,

920
00:53:44.671 --> 00:53:47.850
I've decided that I have to do it.
I've been living in California all my life.

921
00:53:47.851 --> 00:53:52.230
I'm paying to be a surfer.
I live here.
I pay the,
the,
the surfing.

922
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:53.940
Gwinnett tech.
Yeah,
the surfing tax.

923
00:53:53.941 --> 00:53:56.610
But I'm not going to the beach and getting my money's worth.

924
00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:01.110
I got to go and get it.
Yeah.
When we think about how many people live in La,

925
00:54:01.111 --> 00:54:02.250
how few actually

926
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:07.220
<v 1>beach
beach is not that crowded.
No comparison.</v>

927
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:08.690
How many fucking people live here?

928
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:12.890
It's one of those things where people just take it for granted.
Yeah,

929
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:16.280
so who do you serve?
No,
you know what?
I'm scared of sharks.
Yeah,

930
00:54:16.281 --> 00:54:19.250
so I started the quest last year,
so last year I took a couple of lessons,

931
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.890
so this gets a little warmer.
I'm going to do it again.

932
00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:26.240
We were thinking about doing a surfing challenge for sober October.

933
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:31.690
It was going to be like time spent up on a board for the entire month long camp

934
00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:34.100
or contest.
Are you going to be doing it?

935
00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:36.920
We haven't decided and I think the guys are,

936
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:39.980
they don't want to do the surfing thing.
If you do it,
let me know.

937
00:54:39.981 --> 00:54:44.110
I'm want to do it with you.
Yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
cold in October,
wasn't it?
Yeah.

938
00:54:44.111 --> 00:54:46.520
That's the idea.
Pussy come on.

939
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:52.080
Fear held in October,
barely.
It's like acs September.

940
00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.070
With this,
it happens very fast.

941
00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:59.570
The way I thought this is a navy or a French navy men jumped off about to

942
00:54:59.571 --> 00:55:03.300
celebrate and as he was in the water here,
a shark comes after him.
Yeah.

943
00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:05.960
It just comes out of nowhere.
They can't,
no one can really see it.

944
00:55:05.961 --> 00:55:07.270
Then all of a sudden right at the last second this,

945
00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:09.380
they spot it and they're like,
oh shit,
get the fuck out of the way.

946
00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:12.920
It just nibbles.
I got of split a little,
it almost looks fake,

947
00:55:12.921 --> 00:55:15.770
but the way he reacts,
it's not like,
I don't think that shit's fake at all.

948
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:18.050
It just happened.
All of a sudden he's just in the wire.
They didn't.
Yeah man.

949
00:55:18.051 --> 00:55:20.520
That's how it goes.
That's their world.
Look at.

950
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:22.160
You can't even see anything in there.

951
00:55:22.830 --> 00:55:26.520
<v 2>That's the thing that freaks you out the most about the ocean is the
possibility.</v>

952
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.530
It's like you're just looking down.

953
00:55:28.531 --> 00:55:32.250
You don't see a god damn thing and also the meg done.

954
00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:35.850
I liked that Australian guy remember that Australian share for and the shark was

955
00:55:35.851 --> 00:55:38.130
coming after him and he was just pushing him away.

956
00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:40.080
He was in there when he talked about,
he said,
well,

957
00:55:40.081 --> 00:55:43.170
he was looking like he wanted to bite me.
I decided I didn't want him to,

958
00:55:43.171 --> 00:55:45.370
so I just push him away a little bit.
Yeah,

959
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:51.570
you just fought off a shark.
He's like,
yeah,

960
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:55.290
I didn't want to be bitten,
so that's a good attitude.
Occasion.
Yes.

961
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:59.540
I'm not interested in this.
I'm not freaking out,
but I still want to be bit,
yeah,

962
00:55:59.670 --> 00:56:02.160
you don't want to freak out.
Right.
If you freak out that,

963
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.610
they probably can sense it.
If she really spazz out in the water,

964
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:07.680
they probably know all this kind of scared as fuck.

965
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:13.440
I time to east guy smells like food.
They apparently don't like to eat us

966
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:17.720
<v 1>right here.
8 million views.</v>

967
00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:22.370
Great White Shark surprises.
Solitary surfer.
I haven't seen this one.

968
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:23.560
This is not the one I'm talking about

969
00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:27.010
<v 0>swimming,
right?
Oh,
it's going to be seminar.
I don't look right behind him.</v>

970
00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.540
Oh Jeez.
Louise's
surf.

971
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:33.910
I caught it there.
No,
I think he saw it and he's like,

972
00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:37.721
oh man.

973
00:56:37.721 --> 00:56:42.610
But he's paddling his arm with every time he paddles,

974
00:56:42.611 --> 00:56:46.270
the arm could disappear on him.
She's going to surf.

975
00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:52.060
Yeah,
five,
five,
five,
five,
five,
five but you are so helpless in their world.

976
00:56:52.061 --> 00:56:55.570
It's like you ever see what happens when a shark,
it's beached.

977
00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:59.430
<v 4>I was looking for this video that a day we found that one where you were like</v>

978
00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:01.980
white.
Just pick it up and throw it out.
I get in the water.
There's a video.

979
00:57:01.981 --> 00:57:05.060
I saw a girl literally doing that just like a chick in a bikini.
There's,

980
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.180
this is a smaller shark,

981
00:57:06.181 --> 00:57:08.670
but she just grabbed him by the tail yanks it good for her,
does it out,

982
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:12.630
but the problem was with the one you can't see sharks don't just start swimming

983
00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:14.760
when they would get put in the water that they need to be.

984
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.330
It's like they can't stop moving really,
so they got to have a little shove the,

985
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:19.470
it's hard to do too.

986
00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:23.970
They had to drag that shark out by a boat to sort of get it going to get water

987
00:57:23.971 --> 00:57:25.230
and its gills so it can breathe.

988
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:27.940
<v 0>Oh,
okay.
That makes sense.
It's got to be going to,</v>

989
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:31.940
the water's got to come this way because sharks are super weird in terms of

990
00:57:31.941 --> 00:57:35.900
their physiology.
Like if they go upside down and go to sleep.
All right,

991
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:41.650
Jason Sharks and just fucking strange and they have to keep moving.

992
00:57:42.171 --> 00:57:45.410
I don't think they,
they can't breathe if they sit still,

993
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:48.440
unless they find a spot where there's a nice little draft.
Oh,
right,
right,
right.

994
00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:49.610
<v 4>Did he also happened to you?</v>

995
00:57:49.611 --> 00:57:51.710
I can't share this one either cause this is gonna get taken down,

996
00:57:51.711 --> 00:57:53.540
but it's a girl getting pulled into the water.

997
00:57:53.541 --> 00:57:56.900
She's trying to feed a shark off of a boat and it grabs her by the finger and

998
00:57:56.901 --> 00:58:00.860
just yanks her and,
oh gee.
And everybody freaks out.
Also.
It's quick,
fast.

999
00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.100
What kind of shark is it doesn't say,

1000
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:07.150
but also that's in Australia.
So it might be,
yeah.

1001
00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:10.510
<v 0>Fuck that.
I understand.</v>

1002
00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.110
Why does she think she could feed a shark with her fingers?

1003
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:17.360
I told her she could and that was a bad idea.
The worst thing,
you know,

1004
00:58:17.361 --> 00:58:19.610
you're probably right cause you know,
like when you're,

1005
00:58:19.611 --> 00:58:21.380
when you haven't done it before,
you're going to make,

1006
00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:23.150
you're going to ask a reasonable question.

1007
00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.450
Can the shark bite me and pull me in and there's going to tell you something and

1008
00:58:26.451 --> 00:58:30.050
the expert voice like,
no,
he's not interested in you.
You don't look like a seal.

1009
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.400
He's not going to try to bite you.

1010
00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:36.260
Plus she's probably hanging out with like three or four dudes that want to fuck

1011
00:58:36.261 --> 00:58:40.100
her and they're all drunk.
Yup.
They want to show her a good experience.

1012
00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.870
So I was giving her bad advice.
She gets half of her finger removed.

1013
00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:49.730
Fuck then nobody's happy.
Yeah.
You,
what do you like going to Russia so much?

1014
00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:53.780
I do.
I do.
Dean join up there.
Yeah,
I do.
That's a lot of time.

1015
00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:59.390
Let me say.
Um,
well I like 'em,

1016
00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:02.790
I like traveling so this is a cool thing.
I've got to travel so much.

1017
00:59:02.791 --> 00:59:07.270
I haven't got to see a lot of really cool places and uh,
uh,

1018
00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:10.010
Russia is one of them.
I like all the different places I've been there.

1019
00:59:10.011 --> 00:59:12.650
Saint Peter's cool cause Russian,
one thing is it's like America,

1020
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:16.130
lots of different places,
wherever you are.
Like,
you know,

1021
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:20.300
this America to some people could seem like a different country,

1022
00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:22.300
different states that summer.

1023
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:26.210
<v 2>Yeah.
So it's like that.
So,
um,
I got to,
uh,</v>

1024
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:30.200
I go to Moscow Moscow's one thing,
you know,
you get to,
there's a lot of history,

1025
00:59:30.201 --> 00:59:34.220
a lot of Nice things to see.
Saint Petersburg,
same thing.
Um,

1026
00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:39.110
do you feel safe when you're over there?
Well,
I take everything at face value.

1027
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:40.371
So as I,

1028
00:59:40.371 --> 00:59:43.940
that's the way I go through life because if I was to try to always read some

1029
00:59:43.941 --> 00:59:48.650
undercurrents or read what people tell me I'm supposed to experience,
I am,

1030
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:53.480
I'm not,
I'm never going to do anything.
Like I'm a long time ago,
my travels,
my,

1031
00:59:53.481 --> 00:59:54.314
um,
my,

1032
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.790
I was going to go do one a buttered being show down in Alabama and my parents

1033
00:59:58.791 --> 01:00:01.310
were like,
man,
you're going to Alabama,
man,
be safe down there.

1034
01:00:01.311 --> 01:00:03.160
Don't be doing all that stuff.
He'd do,
you know,

1035
01:00:03.161 --> 01:00:06.590
it's going to be different because of,
you know,
American,
our history with racism.

1036
01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:12.260
And,
uh,
I went down there and I was,
you know,
this is what the experience,
uh,

1037
01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:14.930
you might even tell the story because this is a story.
So I went down there,

1038
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:17.070
I was,
I was at the show and,

1039
01:00:17.071 --> 01:00:21.410
and there's some cops come up and they look like the cops from,
you know,

1040
01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:23.840
in the movies from the south that you're supposed to scare you.

1041
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.060
And I took a picture with them and they're like,

1042
01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:28.550
and somebody else came to take a picture and you're like,
well,
look,

1043
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:30.770
when we started going,
Oh man,
I'm gonna do this song.
This is what I'm here to do.

1044
01:00:30.771 --> 01:00:33.980
I mean,
he hang out with people and I'm a referee fights and,
you know,

1045
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:37.730
talk to people they want to talk.
So I took a lot of pictures.

1046
01:00:37.731 --> 01:00:40.190
They were impressed.
They were saying that,
you know,
they've seen other people,

1047
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:44.980
you know,
tell people know about pictures and the guy all side,
they're like,
hey,

1048
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.120
um,
we want you to come out and pull people over with us.

1049
01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.660
And I'm like,
no,
no,
I don't want to do,
I have no interest in doing that.
You know,

1050
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:56.270
I grew up in La,
you know what I mean?
Like they're like,

1051
01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:59.000
and they're getting pumped it like imagine like you're getting pulled over by

1052
01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:03.170
herb dean pitch.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And I'm like,
no,
no,
I don't want to do it.
And uh,

1053
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:06.880
then one goes on,
he goes,
well,
we'll some do some,

1054
01:01:06.881 --> 01:01:09.790
I've been wanting to make us do some tase me or something hurt.

1055
01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:14.330
And so like he grabs this,
his taser gun and sticks to Taser in my hand.

1056
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:18.590
She's,
and I'm sitting there and I'm like,
what the fuck?
So I started tasing him,

1057
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.680
right.
He's in this guy and he's like,

1058
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:28.640
I'm like a,
um,
have.
So then,
um,
I,
after the tasing,

1059
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:32.720
uh,
his buddy,
one of the,
um,
agents and one of the guys was working with me,

1060
01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:36.090
comes up and tells him that he has some business to talk about with me.
I go,
Hey,

1061
01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:37.190
what'd you want to talk about?
It goes,
man,

1062
01:01:37.191 --> 01:01:40.610
I could see you so uncomfortable with what was going on that I just wanted to

1063
01:01:40.611 --> 01:01:42.770
get.
I was like,
thanks.
So I get back to him.

1064
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:47.810
I give back to my hotel room and I,
I was thinking,
I was like,
man,

1065
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:52.070
you know,
I'm worried about people prejudging and being intolerant.

1066
01:01:52.071 --> 01:01:54.650
I'm prejudging of these guys because of uh,

1067
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.500
some history and these guys are really cool.

1068
01:01:57.501 --> 01:02:01.490
If I ever get the opportunity seize guys,
I'm going to be,
you know,
man and I,

1069
01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:04.550
and I did,
they came like right then the phone rings,
I swear.

1070
01:02:04.551 --> 01:02:07.880
And they took me to an after party and really like yeah,
they took it like,

1071
01:02:07.881 --> 01:02:11.240
and it was like the place looks like roadhouse and you know what I mean?

1072
01:02:11.241 --> 01:02:14.840
Like the hell,
everything you see like in a movie,
like,
like you know some,

1073
01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:17.330
you know,
hey,
your wife's not going to be happy about that and,

1074
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.310
and I'm going to catch you next week.
One of types of things,
right?
Yeah.

1075
01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:25.230
Drove me to the airport with the lights on.
It's good,
I think.

1076
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:28.290
I think I still have the picture of me tasing him.
I could show it to you.
It was,

1077
01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:34.470
it was like,
it was a pretty cool experience.
So after that I was like,
man,

1078
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:38.790
whatever.
I think I know about things.
I really don't.

1079
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:43.610
And so,
uh,
so I take things at face value.
Yeah.

1080
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:46.350
I've had good times in Alabama.
I've had good times in the south.

1081
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.170
I think the world's changing too.
I really do.

1082
01:02:49.171 --> 01:02:53.400
I think there's parts of,
especially this country,

1083
01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:58.040
we almost everywhere you can find cool piece.
So,
so,
yeah.
So I mean if,
uh,

1084
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:02.090
you know,
oh my God,
that is hilarious.
So,

1085
01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:05.230
so that should put this on your Instagram.
Can you?
Yeah.

1086
01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:07.560
Can that they wouldn't mind.
I've talked to those guys about it.

1087
01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:09.290
Don't you think he's going to get in trouble though?
No,

1088
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:11.520
he's not going to said he's fine.
He said it'd be all right.

1089
01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.660
I thought he would get in trouble,
so I didn't want to know.
Yeah.

1090
01:03:13.661 --> 01:03:16.130
That's why I haven't put it on.
No,
that's why I never did that.

1091
01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:20.880
But I've actually talked to him.
So anyway,
this,

1092
01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:25.800
um,
that,
that,
yeah,
that's a big lesson to me.
Like,

1093
01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:28.340
Hey,
don't,
don't,
don't think you know what's going on.
You know,

1094
01:03:28.341 --> 01:03:31.690
take things at face value.
Try to beat,
you know,
you know,

1095
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.730
when you've go to Russia,

1096
01:03:32.731 --> 01:03:35.610
you take that attitude like let's just see what the experience or you have your

1097
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:36.360
own experience,

1098
01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.850
what Russians and I'm going to have my own experience and not let it be what

1099
01:03:38.851 --> 01:03:40.170
anyone else's.
And also,

1100
01:03:40.171 --> 01:03:43.380
I had been the Russia before I went in [inaudible] 95 I used to work for a

1101
01:03:43.381 --> 01:03:45.150
company that made documentaries,
these guys.

1102
01:03:45.151 --> 01:03:46.890
And I ended up going along to help him out with,

1103
01:03:46.891 --> 01:03:51.150
it was the first time I'd ever left.
The U S is a big,
had a big effect on me.

1104
01:03:51.151 --> 01:03:55.930
So I,
um,
do you know how to speak it?
No,
no,
no,
no.
I mean,
I can,

1105
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.700
I can do my,
I can do my instructions at and I know some words.
I mean,

1106
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.540
I took some time to learn how to use the alphabet so I can get around and help

1107
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:08.490
me.
It's crazy.
Yeah.
And so,
you know,
like Celtic ancient,

1108
01:04:08.491 --> 01:04:11.700
so really care what it's called.
Is that what it is?
It's a guy named surreal.

1109
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:13.410
So I thought what houses cyrillic here,

1110
01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:18.000
but it's actually named after a guy who made it.
That's the,
the Russian stuff.

1111
01:04:18.001 --> 01:04:21.510
What does that Celtic stuff that you know the,
you know the Oh yeah,
those,

1112
01:04:21.511 --> 01:04:26.160
those rooms.
The little rooms or something?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The letters in Russia.

1113
01:04:26.161 --> 01:04:28.530
Like why is it that,
why would they do it backwards?

1114
01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.920
Like it's the same letter that we have,
but it's backwards.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1115
01:04:31.921 --> 01:04:33.990
That's a,
yeah,
you're talking about,
is that what it is?

1116
01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:37.650
He has the one that looks like a backwards are.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's,

1117
01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.410
that's what they,
that's the yacht.
What does that stand for over there?

1118
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:44.880
Just means Yah.
Yah.
And it's,
we use it,
like I told you that we have that chaos.

1119
01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:45.930
So that's how you say hi.

1120
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.460
You say look at their fucking language and what's up with that age?

1121
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:54.900
What's up with that?
Ups.
H's.
H H is the end.
That's how you use it in.

1122
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.800
Oh my God.
So like when you,
so once you get used to read to you,

1123
01:04:58.810 --> 01:05:01.370
you always see pectal pile everywhere you go.
Right?
What's that?

1124
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:03.580
Lemons restaurant.
What's the upside down little age.

1125
01:05:03.581 --> 01:05:06.910
So it looks like a candle holder.
Yeah,
right there.
What's that?
Yeah,

1126
01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.870
that's an upside down h what happened there?

1127
01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.320
So we took that ancient dumped it on its head,

1128
01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:17.590
but it looks like h and it doesn't it if you flipped it upside down,

1129
01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.820
<v 0>it's a quick look at the e below that.
Like what the fuck is that thing?</v>

1130
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.600
And so that's a yacht that backwards are.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1131
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:30.720
So you would say you would use it like Ja and say that word when you use it like

1132
01:05:30.721 --> 01:05:34.930
a hey,
like just how we use hi.
Oh,
hi.
And we usually like I,

1133
01:05:35.050 --> 01:05:38.620
and then we might use it in another reason too.
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.

1134
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:44.190
So I mean it is kind of amazing how different the way we write is to the way

1135
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:49.030
Asian folks to real freak out.
That's,

1136
01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:54.220
and I,
I think you just have to learn it,
right?
Each one of them.

1137
01:05:54.221 --> 01:05:58.530
When you have to learn each and every one of those there demean.
It seems,

1138
01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.210
it looks like it's pretty hard to learn.
Well,
it looks,

1139
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.780
especially if it's not completely ingrained in your memory as a child,

1140
01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.130
because I ended up late in life.
I know there's some people who speak mandarin,

1141
01:06:09.131 --> 01:06:13.800
but they can't write it.
Yeah,
yeah.
Fuck man.

1142
01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:14.634
It's alien.

1143
01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:19.960
Looks Alien mean that the fact that a whole different side of the world writes

1144
01:06:20.741 --> 01:06:22.360
that way and these little characters.

1145
01:06:22.361 --> 01:06:24.820
So I do have some help when I go over there.
I'm going to tell you some,

1146
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:29.990
I got married a few years ago.
My wife is Russian.
Ah,
there you go.
Yeah,

1147
01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.220
and she speaks Chinese.
So when I go to China region,
right.
It's tiny.

1148
01:06:33.221 --> 01:06:37.540
So when we go to these countries and writes,
she,
it's easier.
They're like,
wow.

1149
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.410
And English or no.
Anyway,

1150
01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:43.960
so we get along because some people are good with languages.

1151
01:06:43.961 --> 01:06:46.060
Man That's incorrect.
Or Spanish is better than mine.

1152
01:06:46.061 --> 01:06:48.130
I already just got here to have Russian,

1153
01:06:48.131 --> 01:06:52.150
which has its own use of the alphabet and then Chinese,

1154
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.180
which is another whole deal.
And English just,

1155
01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:57.820
does she have room in our head for anything else?

1156
01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.700
I know a hard drive would be full.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1157
01:07:00.701 --> 01:07:04.990
That's just as those three languages,
like fuck three hard languages.
Right.

1158
01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:07.720
Probably the hardest.
I heard the rush as hard and and English.

1159
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:10.990
Well I'm not going to say heard,
I tried to trying to learn it.
It's hard.

1160
01:07:10.991 --> 01:07:14.470
There's so many ways to say something cause they conjugate a lot.

1161
01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.590
I think they a lot more than Spanish.
And that's what I have problems with.

1162
01:07:17.591 --> 01:07:19.180
You know,
we all get Spanish words,

1163
01:07:19.181 --> 01:07:22.030
we live in La but conjugating verbs that you know,

1164
01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:27.020
she can do it easy cause she's like,
oh cause they conjugate so much more.
Hmm.

1165
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:32.980
Yeah.
It's,
that's might be the three hardest language to learn outside of.

1166
01:07:32.981 --> 01:07:35.710
Maybe the other one other Asian languages like Japanese is probably pretty

1167
01:07:35.711 --> 01:07:39.790
difficult too.
When I heard the Vietnamese,
it's tough.
Yeah.
And then you know,

1168
01:07:39.791 --> 01:07:42.070
you got those languages that you look at,
you know.
Wow,
that's great.

1169
01:07:42.071 --> 01:07:45.490
And then you see like ancient Hebrew look at Hebrew language,

1170
01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:48.100
like the way they write.
Like what the fuck?
I don't know.

1171
01:07:48.101 --> 01:07:50.530
I bet Arabic stuff Arabics it's gotta be tough.

1172
01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:55.310
I mean how many languages are there?
If you had to guess?
Yeah.

1173
01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:57.760
A hundred,
a hundred days,

1174
01:07:57.761 --> 01:08:00.880
doesn't dialects and depending on like where you are,

1175
01:08:00.881 --> 01:08:04.210
even in Mexico there's different,
right?
Yeah.
Speak the same Spanish down there.

1176
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:07.480
Even in Spanish he had like you can under like,
cause you know,

1177
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:11.650
I took a couple of Spanish classes.
Right.
But I can understand people from,
from,

1178
01:08:11.651 --> 01:08:15.350
you know,
uh,
Spain easier for some reason I grew up right here.

1179
01:08:15.351 --> 01:08:19.670
It's harder for me to understand the way they speak Spanish.
My friend lives in,

1180
01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:22.640
um,
my friend Adam Green tree,
he lives in Australia and uh,

1181
01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:26.780
he has a lot of experience with like the indigenous people that live there

1182
01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:31.840
because he works in a mining company and they deal with a lot of the aborigines.

1183
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:38.020
And um,
they have uh,
the,
the groups of people they call the mobs.

1184
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:43.200
That's what they call themselves instead of like a village or clan or the calls

1185
01:08:43.201 --> 01:08:44.930
off a mob.
That's what,

1186
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:49.340
that's what aboriginal issues and they have different languages for different

1187
01:08:49.341 --> 01:08:54.110
moms.
So like there might be hundreds of mobs and this area and they all have

1188
01:08:54.111 --> 01:08:58.400
different languages.
So you drive.
I go how close?
He was like a few miles.

1189
01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:01.310
I go a few miles,
you know he would say kilometers wide.

1190
01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:05.900
It might be 2,800 kilometers like so you got a hundred kilometers and you've got

1191
01:09:05.901 --> 01:09:06.980
a totally different language.

1192
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:12.620
That's all the different languages is a map of all the,
maybe they're similar,

1193
01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:15.380
right?
Areas of the mops?
I don't believe so.

1194
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:18.400
I think they don't know what the fuck each other are saying.
Right,
right.

1195
01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:22.340
That's why we can't understand Australians.
Right.
If you look at that,

1196
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:23.630
that's crazy.
Yeah.

1197
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.920
Like I don't know who's documenting all this stuff and what whether or not

1198
01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:30.950
they've saved these languages and they,
they have in it.

1199
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:35.610
Cause it's very likely that like little ones of them will just go,

1200
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:39.590
you know,
if these people assimilate the other populations or move out,

1201
01:09:39.591 --> 01:09:41.690
like you might lose these languages.
Yeah.

1202
01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:43.320
Here's what I like about going to Russia to,

1203
01:09:43.321 --> 01:09:46.580
cause there's so many different cultures and so many people and I liked it.

1204
01:09:46.581 --> 01:09:51.140
I like people like I get to,
I got to like a,
I get to go to Graziani,

1205
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.950
haven't been got to,
I've been to Dagestan to grass.
Knee is in Chechnya.
Yeah.

1206
01:09:56.950 --> 01:10:00.710
It's really,
it was a really cool place.
I went to a show you some pictures,

1207
01:10:00.711 --> 01:10:03.740
went to uh,
uh,
went and looked him my well because it's,

1208
01:10:03.741 --> 01:10:07.220
for me what's really cool about it is the energy that people have about

1209
01:10:07.221 --> 01:10:10.070
developing over there right now.
Because the place,
there was a war there,

1210
01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:11.740
you know about that,
right?
Yeah.

1211
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:16.640
There was a war and a right now and they're really building up and they're

1212
01:10:16.641 --> 01:10:18.910
really excited about it.
So I think it's just,
uh,

1213
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:23.530
it's cool to go and see people who are really,
uh,

1214
01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:27.650
a cui kind of a group mentality about moving forward,
you know?

1215
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:32.120
So what,
where exactly is this and what was their war?

1216
01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.370
You're to Chechnya.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So they had a war with Russia,
right?
Oh,
civil war.

1217
01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:41.300
So see that's what it used to look like.
Yeah.
Now you've got a picture of it now,

1218
01:10:41.301 --> 01:10:45.890
right?
Yeah.
So it's the,
ah,
there it is now rebuilding.

1219
01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:49.010
Yeah.
And there's that rebuilt their,
their energetic about it,

1220
01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.100
and there's pride of then it's,

1221
01:10:50.130 --> 01:10:52.820
and it's cool is a cool to be able to go there and get to see it.

1222
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.380
That is cool to see something in the middle of a rebirth like that.
Right?
Yeah.

1223
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:59.000
It's beautiful.
And in that area,
a lot of the places,
yeah,

1224
01:10:59.001 --> 01:11:02.240
there's a lot of rebirth energy going on.
Oh Wow.

1225
01:11:02.241 --> 01:11:06.620
So that's what it looked like right after the war.
God Damn.
Wow.

1226
01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:13.950
That's a crazy image.
So you've been this now,

1227
01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:18.480
<v 2>uh,
traveling around the world like this for how many years?
For a long time.</v>

1228
01:11:18.481 --> 01:11:23.100
I think.
Um,
let me think.
I mean,
I see,
I probably would,

1229
01:11:23.101 --> 01:11:26.630
we're doing stuff with MMA a and traveling for the sport I've got,

1230
01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.580
I started probably traveling around to travel around internationally,

1231
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:33.210
around 2003 or four.
Wow.
And then,
um,

1232
01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.590
but I got to travel around the US a lot before that,
so that was really cool.

1233
01:11:37.591 --> 01:11:41.070
Got to go to places like,
you know,
uh,
you know,
uh,

1234
01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:43.860
that I would never go to a Indiana someplace in Indiana.

1235
01:11:43.861 --> 01:11:46.680
I'd never go or you know,
and,
and some of these,
um,

1236
01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.450
I've got to go all through the,
throughout most of the states in the u s uh,

1237
01:11:51.451 --> 01:11:54.540
because even before I was doing a lot of the UFC,

1238
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:58.020
I refereed for king of the cage.
So by the time I got to the UFC,

1239
01:11:58.350 --> 01:12:00.510
I got to referee more fights than anyone I knew.

1240
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.780
I think I met you at a king cake.
Yeah.
Way Back in the day.
Communicate.

1241
01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:08.220
We met there.
Yeah.
That was like 2000 what?
I was probably 2001 or 2000.

1242
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:10.020
That was when they were an Indian reservation.

1243
01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:13.110
It's probably 2000 cause they started there in 2000 and you're there at the

1244
01:12:13.111 --> 01:12:16.470
early ones,
right?
Yeah.
When they first started,
Eddie was,

1245
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:20.670
Eddie was a working for them.
Yeah.
And my friend Bud Brotzmann was,
yeah,
yeah,

1246
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:24.420
yeah.
Bud Men.
But didn't like Terry decided to let me referee bud,

1247
01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:28.230
but her was hard on me at first.
Really?
Well,
yeah.
Bob was roughing,
but now,

1248
01:12:28.231 --> 01:12:30.330
but then he started to like me,
but it was rough on me.

1249
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:33.130
You didn't want you to referee it first with they,
Larry was about it.

1250
01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:35.720
That's how I started refereeing.
Larry was very,

1251
01:12:35.730 --> 01:12:39.330
was a referee and I trained with Larry and uh,
everybody liked Rarey.

1252
01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:41.310
Larry as a referees are really,
you know,

1253
01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:45.060
there is a really good guy and he did a lot to um,
uh,

1254
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.660
he went and when he started doing it,
he went and did a little research and,

1255
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:50.880
and uh,
you know,

1256
01:12:50.881 --> 01:12:54.900
talk to people from the commission from doing boxing and kickboxing and you
know,

1257
01:12:54.901 --> 01:12:58.650
so he put inspectors in place and things like that.
And that was my job at first.

1258
01:12:58.950 --> 01:13:01.650
I will go out there and we'd bring all our guys out and I would like kind of

1259
01:13:01.950 --> 01:13:05.610
manage the inspecting team and um,
uh,
then,
uh,

1260
01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.130
I think they ended up working me too hard one show.
And I was like,
man,
I came in,

1261
01:13:09.131 --> 01:13:11.670
volunteer my time,
I want to be able to see at least a fight or two.

1262
01:13:11.671 --> 01:13:15.570
And I had just come to work for you.
And,
uh,
Terry,
uh,
it was like,
oh,

1263
01:13:15.571 --> 01:13:18.090
I'll make it up to you and I want to try reference.
I was like,
let me,

1264
01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:19.830
I'll try referee if I goes okay,
do that.

1265
01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:24.600
And then I remember the first time it was like,
man,
I think when I was like,
wow,

1266
01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:28.410
I really signed up for something here.
You know what I mean?
So yeah,
it was,

1267
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:31.290
but yeah.
That's Kinda how that happened.
When did you,
you,
you've had,

1268
01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.830
how many fights did you have?
Oh,
I've had,
I think a five.

1269
01:13:35.130 --> 01:13:37.680
And when did you decide did the,

1270
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:40.740
was it because of refereeing that they decided that it wasn't,

1271
01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:43.560
it was a conflict of interest for you to continue your career?
Well,
see,

1272
01:13:43.561 --> 01:13:47.580
I was never like a real serious competitor as like,
I like to train,

1273
01:13:47.581 --> 01:13:50.110
I like to do that.
And then every now and then,
ah,

1274
01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:52.260
I'm wanting something to train for,
you know what I mean?

1275
01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:56.060
And so give me something to motivate me or I'd be fun to do it,
you know?
Um,

1276
01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:00.630
and what happened is someone told me that it was a conflict of interest and
that,

1277
01:14:00.631 --> 01:14:03.720
uh,
I needed to pick one or the other and a,

1278
01:14:03.721 --> 01:14:05.800
and no one's gonna miss me as a fighter.
So,

1279
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.130
so,
you know,
that's,
that's kind of how that worked out.
Well,
you're

1280
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:13.750
<v 0>definitely one of the best in the world,
man.</v>

1281
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:17.770
I get happy when your referee in a fight because I know that it's going to be

1282
01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.190
handled the row,

1283
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:22.780
I mean I agree with you on virtually every single time you and I've had a

1284
01:14:22.781 --> 01:14:26.230
discussion about what should or shouldn't be done.
Um,

1285
01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:29.920
the one thing that drives me crazy about referees and not you,

1286
01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:35.160
but some referees is breaks and stand ups that don't necessarily need to happen.

1287
01:14:35.890 --> 01:14:39.190
When guys are working towards something and you can see there's like a battle,

1288
01:14:39.191 --> 01:14:42.730
the guy trying to defend guys trying to get out of half guard to get an amount

1289
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:46.390
and then you'll see a referee come over and just separate it because they're the

1290
01:14:46.391 --> 01:14:50.040
crowd's booing or because they don't understand what's happening.

1291
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:54.040
How much of a struggle it is.
Right.
Especially clinch work.
Exactly.

1292
01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:58.000
The guys get a guy up against the cage,
there's,
they're working for something.

1293
01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:02.830
They might stall each other out,
but eventually someone might break down.

1294
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:06.190
Right.
I mean,
and this is how a guy looked,
Norma Madoff wins,

1295
01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:10.180
fights against elite guys.
This is how Randy coture one,
a lot of fights.

1296
01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:14.890
It's a legitimate tactic.
Yeah.
Cause it doesn't look fun for you.
You know,

1297
01:15:14.891 --> 01:15:19.420
like a guy beating a guy up against the cage,
just short elbows,
knees,
the thighs.

1298
01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.990
You might think that that's not enough.
But that's,
that's uh,

1299
01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:28.150
that's a good way to where a dude out and you keep doing that until eventually

1300
01:15:28.151 --> 01:15:31.540
you break them.
And especially when you're someone like Steve Bay or,
yeah,

1301
01:15:31.810 --> 01:15:36.280
I think,
I think for me it's helpful as I do my pre-fight instructions,
you know,

1302
01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:40.120
so I tell the fighters what I expect and what to expect from me,

1303
01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:41.470
you know what I mean?
So I don't want to,

1304
01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:45.130
I want to interfere as little as possible.
Yeah.
I know you do.
And so that's,

1305
01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:47.950
that's my goal.
And so I,
you know,
I give him instruction.
If I tell him,
you know,

1306
01:15:47.951 --> 01:15:52.430
hey,
work,
work what I expect and you know,
I expect you to do something too.
I'm,

1307
01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:55.120
well,
I'm looking for big shots or advance your position.

1308
01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:57.190
And then they'll ask me like,
well how much,

1309
01:15:57.370 --> 01:16:00.040
how long will you leave something stale?
I go,
well,
what is still,

1310
01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:02.260
if they're both guys were relaxed that still,

1311
01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.050
but like you're talking about even up against the fence and a clinch,

1312
01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:08.350
especially that's where a lot of things are really getting decided.

1313
01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:11.680
And so we have to really see that play out.
You know,

1314
01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.840
especially a lot of the guys are,
you know,
if they're,

1315
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:17.170
they're striking it each other,
maybe in some of the other weight classes,

1316
01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:21.560
you know,
uh,
then they don't have that one punch all ways.
Uh,

1317
01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:23.530
some of the guys do,
but not everyone does.

1318
01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:26.170
And that's where things are going to get cited in that clinch.

1319
01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:28.810
And if there's a tension,
if there's a tension there,

1320
01:16:28.811 --> 01:16:31.780
we need to see where that's going to go and let it work itself out.

1321
01:16:31.930 --> 01:16:34.490
I'm so glad you said that.
That's a perfect way to say it.
And the,

1322
01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:37.960
that's absolutely a hundred percent agree.
And there's,

1323
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:40.630
there's moments where it changes the course of the fight where it's really

1324
01:16:40.631 --> 01:16:42.070
unfortunate.
Um,

1325
01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:46.420
you didn't referee Camaros and Damien Maia did do and I don't think so.

1326
01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:49.810
Whoever did that one,
we don't even have to pull it up,

1327
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:54.040
but there was a moment in the first round when Damien Maia got ahold of tomorrow

1328
01:16:54.041 --> 01:16:58.000
and was trying to take his back standing and he had like one hook in and a

1329
01:16:58.001 --> 01:17:01.660
clinch and he was hanging onto him and the referee decided not enough was taking

1330
01:17:01.661 --> 01:17:05.470
place.
They separated them.
I'm like,
Oh,
you can't do that.

1331
01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:08.800
So hard to get ahold of [inaudible] wasn't me.

1332
01:17:08.801 --> 01:17:13.570
Who did that Guy Damien Maia about to get you back?
Whoa.
I said,

1333
01:17:13.571 --> 01:17:17.600
no,
no,
that's not going anywhere.
And that Sarah went crazy.
You know,
he has that,

1334
01:17:17.601 --> 01:17:21.290
um,
that podcast.
He does what?
Jim Norton and he's like,

1335
01:17:21.291 --> 01:17:25.170
you just don't do that until the guy like,
he's,
he's got ahold of him.
Like he,

1336
01:17:25.171 --> 01:17:28.790
he might take his back here like,
yeah,
like in,
you know,

1337
01:17:28.791 --> 01:17:32.420
you saw what he did with Lyman good when he takes your back in Lima goods

1338
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:36.150
appeased.
But when Damien Maia gets a hold,

1339
01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.730
especially early in the round,

1340
01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:42.620
it's fresh and he's got his back already and then he has a lot of interesting

1341
01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:44.530
take down from there too.
While he's like,
he goes,

1342
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:48.860
goes back and forth with Taf way taking your back and then one year definitive

1343
01:17:48.861 --> 01:17:49.221
take down,

1344
01:17:49.221 --> 01:17:52.370
he starts taking your back and then when you go back then he's back working on

1345
01:17:52.371 --> 01:17:56.530
yet.
So no,
he works really,
he works at a real interesting pace there.
You know,

1346
01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:01.400
it's stunning to watch him go through guys.
Like when he went through Rick story,

1347
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:02.870
I was like,
Jesus Christ.

1348
01:18:02.871 --> 01:18:07.130
Like Rick story's a powerful wrestler and when he takes his back and he gets him

1349
01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:10.070
in that neck crank and you see the blood squirting out of his nose and like,

1350
01:18:10.071 --> 01:18:14.360
Whoa,
yeah,
this is,
this is a heavy fucking squeeze.

1351
01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:19.120
This guy has.
And then he did it to Carlos condit.
Um,
who else has done to,

1352
01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:21.080
it's not a lot of guys.
He gets a hold of you.

1353
01:18:21.081 --> 01:18:23.720
It's just squeezes the life and when it gets on top,

1354
01:18:23.721 --> 01:18:28.020
he seems so heavy on Magni when he went and ran through Neil magnate.
Oh yeah,

1355
01:18:28.021 --> 01:18:29.660
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1356
01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:33.860
It's just such high level Jujitsu on top.

1357
01:18:33.861 --> 01:18:38.780
He's just dad just no air to smushes you.
It's um,
I'm,

1358
01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:40.760
I'm such a sucker for a specialist,

1359
01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:44.990
whether it's a style vendor specialist was striking specialist or a Damien Maia

1360
01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:49.340
specialist.
I love watching the guys that are like at the tip of the,

1361
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:53.060
the ability in whatever the discipline eyes and stop vendor man.

1362
01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.680
He seems to be getting better every time.
Yeah.

1363
01:18:55.910 --> 01:19:00.380
Well for him it was just a v avoiding takedowns like he was so high level as a

1364
01:19:00.381 --> 01:19:05.000
kickboxer.
He's so clever.
Like he's,
he's like,
in my opinion,

1365
01:19:05.001 --> 01:19:09.030
probably the very best in the sport.
It's setting traps.
Yeah.
He'll,

1366
01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.930
he'll like gauge you see what you're doing.
They'll switch stances,

1367
01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:14.960
getting some information.
Yeah.
It's not,
it's not random.

1368
01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:17.930
And I liked the way he deals with the take downs.
I mean,

1369
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:20.600
he knows where he's safe and where he's not.
You don't see that he's,

1370
01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:23.690
and he's like,
yeah,
it's got a minute that this cook them in it.
But I seen,

1371
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:25.550
I seen what their,
this attempt looks like.

1372
01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:29.030
I see what this one looks like walking it through.
All right.

1373
01:19:29.031 --> 01:19:30.740
Now my party is going to start.
Yeah.

1374
01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:34.070
Here's a guy I talked to one of his guys he trains with um,

1375
01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:37.130
I've was referenced in fights in China and uh,

1376
01:19:37.131 --> 01:19:40.190
it's one of the guys who trained with a New Zealand and this guy was telling me

1377
01:19:40.191 --> 01:19:44.510
so much and show me different things about angles they do and things that they

1378
01:19:44.511 --> 01:19:47.360
set up in their striking that I had never knew or thought about.

1379
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:51.370
And this was before I saw him start fighting in the UFC.
You know,
it just,

1380
01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:55.400
we have,
everybody was aware of him but he hadn't been in the UFC.
Yeah.
And Man,

1381
01:19:55.401 --> 01:19:58.240
these guys,
these guys are really smart.
These,

1382
01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:02.420
the techniques like this sport is growing so much,
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.

1383
01:20:02.421 --> 01:20:05.930
That's what I was saying.
Like when you're seeing like really high level,

1384
01:20:05.931 --> 01:20:07.830
super technical like him,

1385
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:12.240
like who's a worldclass Labine as good.

1386
01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:15.420
He easily could be world champion in many organizations as a kickboxer.

1387
01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.200
And to see him now in the UFC and seek guys having to deal with that.

1388
01:20:19.201 --> 01:20:22.440
It's like wow,
okay,
this is like the Anderson five's a great,
great example.

1389
01:20:22.441 --> 01:20:24.150
We'd know how great Anderson is.
Yeah.

1390
01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:26.370
And it still looked pretty good against style bender,

1391
01:20:26.371 --> 01:20:29.100
but you could see why style bender was special in that fight.

1392
01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.080
Did he add like another level of trickery?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1393
01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:37.290
And I mean and stuff John Jones is doing.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1394
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:40.140
Well so you can't call him a specialist's cause man he does so many different

1395
01:20:40.141 --> 01:20:43.050
styles.
Right.
It's like a,
it's really like a Kung Fu movie,
right?

1396
01:20:43.051 --> 01:20:47.700
Where he changed styles.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then they do they do something.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1397
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:51.330
Well John,
such a good kicker too.
I mean that's,

1398
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:54.490
that's interesting that he started out as a wrestler.
Cause like how,

1399
01:20:54.491 --> 01:20:56.670
how much of his style now is kicking you.

1400
01:20:56.730 --> 01:21:00.920
It's a giant part of his game is utilization of those long ass legs.
Right.
And,

1401
01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:04.630
and,
and he's,
and it's interesting like how,
how much time he did.

1402
01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:06.340
It looks like he's getting information on that.

1403
01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.200
Then all of a sudden then when it shifts gears,
it's like,
okay,

1404
01:21:10.201 --> 01:21:14.190
I've gotten a lot of information and here's what to do with it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1405
01:21:15.060 --> 01:21:18.800
He's gonna Fight Tiago Santos,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1406
01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:24.300
That guy goes for broke.
I mean he goes for broke.

1407
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:29.380
It's interesting to watch him fight because you want to talk about like a,

1408
01:21:29.381 --> 01:21:33.570
a wild reckless dude.
Like Santos is dangerous.

1409
01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:37.800
Jon Jones should and probably will be a heavy favorite,

1410
01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:43.280
but Santos,
he does.
He throws something.
Hey,
make no,
no,

1411
01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:46.560
it's going to be,
it's going to be a,
it's a great fight to watch.
Yeah.

1412
01:21:46.561 --> 01:21:49.980
That guy's going to go out on his shield.
No,
he and he puts pressure.

1413
01:21:50.190 --> 01:21:52.980
I think the interesting thing about,
uh,
well for me,

1414
01:21:52.981 --> 01:21:56.340
what's interesting when I watched any of the heavier guys fight is that they

1415
01:21:56.341 --> 01:21:59.280
really have to understand where they're safe and whether or not that's something

1416
01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:00.330
that John does really good.

1417
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:03.170
How to be in the pocket and the places where he's safe.
And you know,

1418
01:22:03.180 --> 01:22:06.360
knowing where he's,
yeah,
he's the best ever at utilizing his reach,

1419
01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:09.180
but no one's ever been better at controlling reach.

1420
01:22:09.181 --> 01:22:12.540
And then never letting a guy reset.
When guys try to reset,

1421
01:22:12.541 --> 01:22:16.110
Bambi kicked some bammy kicks him again.
Bam.
He kicks him again.
And he's like,

1422
01:22:16.111 --> 01:22:19.050
he knows when you're trying to get comfortable,
when you're trying to settle in.

1423
01:22:19.170 --> 01:22:21.840
And that's when he kicks you like,
it sounds like he senses it.

1424
01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.250
I just starts battering you like you see?
He's like,
no,
no,
no breaks.
No.
No breaks,

1425
01:22:26.430 --> 01:22:31.320
no breaks,
no breaks like the brakes.
What about a man?
Um,

1426
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.280
Max Holloway.
Oh Dude.
He's the king of no breaks.

1427
01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:41.100
There's no break.
Oh,
Miss Pours it on you.
He's just keeps coming.

1428
01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:46.530
Keeps coming.
What happened?
Um,
he pours it on you.

1429
01:22:46.531 --> 01:22:48.630
He keeps coming and it's fucking combinations.

1430
01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:52.860
Several high profile fighters confirm for UFC two 39 including Michael Cassa

1431
01:22:52.861 --> 01:22:55.620
versus Diego Sanchez fight shit.

1432
01:22:56.370 --> 01:23:01.200
There's one Michael Kassan pack a lunch,
Bro.

1433
01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:06.100
Oh versus dos Santos.
Oh,

That's it.
That's a great one.
So that's Vegas.

1434
01:23:06.610 --> 01:23:11.550
<v 1>Yeah.
Yeah.
Ooh,
yeah,
that's,</v>

1435
01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:14.590
that's good.
Yon Blow.
Hovish verses Luke Rockhold.

1436
01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:18.400
That's a great fight to rock holds first fight at light heavyweight.

1437
01:23:18.401 --> 01:23:22.000
And you just learn how to say that.
[inaudible] um,

1438
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:24.970
I think I listened to someone else saying,
I just repeated the noise

1439
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:30.430
I had the hardest time with is a beat.
It's a beat.

1440
01:23:30.431 --> 01:23:33.840
Magomed Sharp Pauvre oh yeah.
Hard.
Yeah.

1441
01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.950
That dude who he's nasty.
He's fun to watch.
Yeah.

1442
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:43.090
He's fun to watch.
I did to some nasty shit in there.
So technical.

1443
01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.800
So Chris,
you know,
and again,
long range.

1444
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:50.790
Yeah.
Yeah.
But can take it to man.
I mean,
he,

1445
01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:55.330
he ate some bombs from Jeremy fucking Stevens who's one of the biggest bomb

1446
01:23:55.331 --> 01:24:00.010
throwers in the division.
Yeah.
Jeremy has some fucking weapons.
Yeah,
no,
that,
yeah.

1447
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:03.670
Yeah.
That was,
I remember when that fight wasn't high and I was like,
man,

1448
01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:05.620
I couldn't wait to watch that.
Yeah.
That was a great fight.

1449
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:09.870
It's close fight to close fight.
I mean,
I think the decision went to is a beat.

1450
01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:14.590
Um,
and Jeremy disputed it a little bit,
but I met another close fight.

1451
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:19.090
Very good fight.
But I think the decision was correct,
but the beat is,
um,

1452
01:24:19.450 --> 01:24:23.800
you know,
he's had an interesting style.
Right.
Really good grappling.
Crazy trips.

1453
01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:28.240
Yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of crazy real old school.
Traditional martial arts kicks,

1454
01:24:28.241 --> 01:24:31.900
throws her heel kicks and three 60 roundhouse kicks and shit.
Right,
right,
right.

1455
01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:36.450
You know,
real,
a lot of great slide.
A lot of balance there.
Yeah.

1456
01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:39.020
There's so much talent now.
I mean,

1457
01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:44.100
I can't remember a time where there was so many elite high level fighters that

1458
01:24:44.201 --> 01:24:45.670
were like so exciting to watch.

1459
01:24:45.671 --> 01:24:48.460
There's so many good guys that's like really good guys.

1460
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:53.530
People are slipping through and this sport is growing so much.

1461
01:24:53.530 --> 01:24:57.460
And Groin.
Yeah.
Growing all over the world.
Some of these,

1462
01:24:57.530 --> 01:25:00.550
like that's one of the cool things about the travel is you get to go see in some

1463
01:25:00.551 --> 01:25:01.960
of these,
some of these guys,

1464
01:25:01.961 --> 01:25:05.920
some of these athletes and other parts of the world have a huge following and no

1465
01:25:05.921 --> 01:25:08.860
one's ever heard of him.
This is one guy.
Uh,

1466
01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.800
I'm Mary Barra Akbari.
He,

1467
01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:16.540

Really?
Yeah.

1468
01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.010
No Shit.
He's a UFC guy.
No,
no,
no.
That's what I'm saying.
He,

1469
01:25:21.370 --> 01:25:26.170
he's the guy who's never fought in the UFC.
Where's he fight?
He fights in a,
uh,

1470
01:25:26.230 --> 01:25:31.180
ACA.
No,
Kenton is the Russian organization.

What does it stand for?
The absolute championship.
ACMA.

1472
01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.700
Achmad what does Oakmont mean?
I think there is 1.6 million,

1473
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:45.090
but look how handsome he is.
You know,

1474
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:50.440

I refereed to fight and iser by genre.
He was at sea.
A heavyweight.

I must see why.
Yeah,
he's a big heavyweight.

1476
01:25:53.730 --> 01:25:56.590
Do you think you'd passes a Piss test?
You know,

1477
01:25:56.591 --> 01:25:57.970
I'm not living in the man's pocket,

1478
01:25:57.971 --> 01:25:59.800
so I don't know if anyone can pass a piss test.

1479
01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:04.100
I really don't know.
I really

1480
01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:04.250
<v 2>don't.</v>

1481
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:07.920
That's not something that I'm not an expert on that I leave that impression.

1482
01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:10.880
I think he's,
he likes wrestling.

1483
01:26:12.170 --> 01:26:14.060
I think a lot of fighters like wrestling right now.

1484
01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:18.010
The cm Ronda Rousey make that Cha Ching.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like,
hmm.

1485
01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:20.630
I could do that.
Do you watch pro wrestling?

1486
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.820
I've watched occasionally when Tony Hinchcliffe makes me.
Why do you watch it?

1487
01:26:25.900 --> 01:26:29.510
No,
no.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I didn't think you would.

1488
01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:37.820
I go get it either.
I'm not 14 yeah,
it was.
I loved it.
No,
when I was a kid,

1489
01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:41.780
when I realized it was,
I liked it when I was six.

1490
01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.820
I liked it a lot and I then don't get me wrong,
I don't risk,

1491
01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:46.430
not that I don't respect what they're doing.

1492
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:50.840
I used to work at it and notes or Gnocchi Dojo and I did some pro wrestling

1493
01:26:51.020 --> 01:26:54.350
workouts with them just to see what they're doing and then taking those bumps

1494
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:56.690
and some of the stuff they would do off to like,

1495
01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:00.140
there's no way I will be doing that with my body.
So all respect to it,

1496
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:04.190
but it's just that this doesn't cut me out.
I feel exactly the same way they,

1497
01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.720
they,
they should be respected as being incredibly tough talent.

1498
01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:10.430
Very difficult child.
Yeah.
Athletic,
talented.

1499
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:14.300
The guys that are really good at it that make it look like,
you know,
like art.

1500
01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:18.050
Yeah.
I liked Jimmy superfly snicker when I was a kid.
I love that guy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1501
01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.280
Bob Backlund.
Remember him?

1502
01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.090
I don't remember who remember the Iron Sheik of Oh yeah,
of course.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1503
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:28.780
yeah.
There was some fun times,
but yeah,
I prefer real things.
Yeah.

1504
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:33.650
I mean I get it.
I get the appeal,
you know,
but I,
uh,
I,
I,
that's like,

1505
01:27:33.651 --> 01:27:37.550
once you watch really good fights,
it's hard.

1506
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:42.350
It's hard to give a shit about fake fights.
Yeah.

1507
01:27:42.351 --> 01:27:46.520
And I just,
yeah,
I don't,
I don't get it.
I didn't know I didn't get it.
Yeah.

1508
01:27:47.170 --> 01:27:52.070
Yeah,
I know.
But you know what,
some people love it and you know,

1509
01:27:52.071 --> 01:27:54.770
that's the thing,
you know,
some people will know every bit of it,

1510
01:27:54.771 --> 01:27:58.400
every stick and you know,
I don't know,
but I think there's probably,
you know,

1511
01:27:58.401 --> 01:28:00.800
who knows.
I might,
it might catch me cause,
you know,

1512
01:28:00.801 --> 01:28:04.160
I'm always trying to get hip to stuff,
so if there's something I don't enjoy,

1513
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:07.950
I like to do it with somebody who enjoys it so I can kind of watch them and kind

1514
01:28:07.951 --> 01:28:09.970
of learn how to enjoy it.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.

1515
01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:12.680
Like what's the part that you like about this?
You know what I mean?

1516
01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.260
Or like I didn't listen to a lot of country music,
but then,
um,
I will,

1517
01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:21.080
I used to work with glad,
either challenge a lot and Ted Williams was like,

1518
01:28:21.081 --> 01:28:23.870
you don't like country music.
So he gave me country music education.

1519
01:28:24.370 --> 01:28:26.810
What's the matter?
What you don't like?
Tell him you can see the same good music.

1520
01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:32.220
And then I was like,
okay.
Hey,
I got you.
What did you get into?
Uh,

1521
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:35.260
well I started when I started grabbing it.
I liked the old stuff.
I like boot cut.

1522
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:40.280
I like 'em Moreau.
I like Kris Kristofferson Sunday morning coming down.

1523
01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:43.690
Yeah.
And I like your boy.
Your boy was on your were sturgeon.
Yeah.

1524
01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.190
Sturge will I like stores.
That's it is deep.
Right?

1525
01:28:46.191 --> 01:28:51.050
He's a bad motherfucker I seeking Jesus play with.
Yeah,

1526
01:28:51.051 --> 01:28:53.000
he's,
yeah,
he's legit.

1527
01:28:53.310 --> 01:28:56.770
That that song is a well written song,
man,

1528
01:28:56.771 --> 01:28:58.430
that he's a trip of a story man.

1529
01:28:58.431 --> 01:29:02.040
He was like working regular jobs working on and his

1530
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.240
<v 0>wife told him he could make a living doing music.
She's like,
you know,</v>

1531
01:29:06.241 --> 01:29:07.290
you don't suck at this.

1532
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.170
So she told him to go for it and now he's like one of the biggest music artists

1533
01:29:13.171 --> 01:29:17.960
in the world.
Right,
right.
It's crazy.
And it didn't take long either,
man.
Yeah,

1534
01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:21.180
that,
that turtles all the way down like that.
So that's a really cool song.

1535
01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:22.980
First Time,
first time I met him,

1536
01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:27.320
like almost immediately after meeting them we got high as fuck and to the
podcast

1537
01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:32.870
we loo barbecued.
It's been a couple of times where,
you know,

1538
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.280
he called me up after the podcast,
so it was like,
man,

1539
01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:39.060
I didn't even know what the fuck we were talking about for the first 20 minutes

1540
01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:42.100
because we were so high.
Because if you live in Nashville like,

1541
01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:45.750
and he lives in the Nashville area,
you go out there and get the weed,

1542
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:49.830
they have pretty good weed.
It's okay,
but it's not California.

1543
01:29:49.831 --> 01:29:52.740
We'd like California where you'd,
it's preposterous.
Right?
Right.

1544
01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.730
If you're not used to that stuff and you smoke that shit and try to be on air,

1545
01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:59.460
like all of a sudden now you're on a podcast or on air.

1546
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.510
And we were talking about like,
yeah,
I don't think I could keep up.
I was like,

1547
01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:08.430
I can,
can you keep up with a joy?
No.
I went on his podcast,

1548
01:30:08.431 --> 01:30:13.150
man,
and he packed enough,
I think they'd get a village high pick.

1549
01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:18.090
He put it in this,
this bowl is like,
and just tore it up,
emptied out,

1550
01:30:18.091 --> 01:30:20.310
did it again.
And then eight a gummy bear and was like,

1551
01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:23.940
I started putting on pink Floyd.

1552
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:30.000
He's a real deal man.
You know?
I mean he's free.
Joey Diaz is free.

1553
01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.110
Yeah.
You know,
I'm not that free man.
I'm not that free.
I wish I could be.
I,

1554
01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.620
you know,
and I have,
I have,
I have respect for it.

1555
01:30:37.621 --> 01:30:41.340
Just be like you said that freeness yeah,
a lot of people were free.
Yeah.

1556
01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:45.060
But I'm not as pretty like,
I think your boys,
lot of your,

1557
01:30:45.150 --> 01:30:47.220
your people seem kind of free.
Like who?

1558
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:50.570
I think Eddie Bravo seems for you and he's a free thinker man.
Yeah.

1559
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:55.630
And others.
Yeah know Eddie's a,

1560
01:30:55.660 --> 01:31:00.510
that's why his Jujitsu so creative.
He's,
he's,
he's so open to ideas,

1561
01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:05.220
you know?
I mean he's,
he's also like,
he doesn't like losing,
so he's like,

1562
01:31:05.221 --> 01:31:06.660
he's like,
oh no,
I'm going to figure out how to win.

1563
01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.830
I'm going to figure how to beat this.

1564
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.810
So he'll look con con like he'll like look at a position and he'll have some

1565
01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:16.650
weird unorthodox take on how to get to a better spot or how to control the

1566
01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:19.040
position better or how to finish from there.
And they're like,

1567
01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:22.400
you'll see like damn,
like his,
he's just everything.
You know,

1568
01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.980
if you have a conversation with him about,
about stuff and he is,

1569
01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:29.130
you'll learn a lot just from every time like,
okay,
I know you did.

1570
01:31:29.210 --> 01:31:31.500
You got to take away something from him.
Dude.
He's,

1571
01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.920
I can't do one of the bits that he's doing,
but he's,

1572
01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:39.810
he's doing stand up now and some of this shit is really fucking funny,
man.

1573
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:43.680
He made me laugh really hard last night.
Really.
I would have to do the bit,

1574
01:31:43.681 --> 01:31:46.730
I would have to tell you the bit to show you I've been so when he does stand it.

1575
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:51.050
Yeah I seen him on salt so I should go stay funny man.
It's getting really fun.

1576
01:31:51.051 --> 01:31:53.820
It's getting more and more comfortable doing it.
He was always funny.

1577
01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:58.230
I mean he always used to make me laugh but a,
he tried it way back in the day.

1578
01:31:58.231 --> 01:32:00.160
He tried stand up many,
many,
many moons

1579
01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:00.993
<v 1>ago.</v>

1580
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:05.170
Like fucking 2003 or four or something like that.

1581
01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:08.800
He tried and it just wasn't for him.
He was too busy with other stuff.
He just,

1582
01:32:08.801 --> 01:32:12.850
he tried,
he was going to try it and then get good at it.
But he got,

1583
01:32:12.851 --> 01:32:16.450
he bombed a few times.
He's like fuck this.
And then he tried it again,

1584
01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:20.680
I want to say like four years ago.
Was it about that three years ago,

1585
01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:24.730
four years ago,
somewhere in that range.
And uh,

1586
01:32:24.760 --> 01:32:28.390
he's been doing it steady since.
He's actually pretty funny man.
Like,
like,

1587
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:31.110
like made me laugh like really loud.
Yeah.

1588
01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:34.620
Cause I've seen it on social media that you guys have some shows where like he's

1589
01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:38.140
on there.
You are on it a bunch of,
yeah.
That's how Sam Tripoli's shows.
Yeah.

1590
01:32:38.141 --> 01:32:41.320
A lot of Sam shows.
He does a,
a podcast,

1591
01:32:41.321 --> 01:32:44.980
tinfoil hat podcast with Sam and uh,
we're all real good friends.

1592
01:32:44.981 --> 01:32:47.500
And Sam is also a conspiracy nut.

1593
01:32:47.501 --> 01:32:51.760
So they get together and talk about the Illuminati and shit.
Yeah,

1594
01:32:51.790 --> 01:32:54.660
I have friends like that.
Yeah,
I remember.
Yeah.

1595
01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:00.190
Yeah.
I go back and forth with conspiracies.

1596
01:33:00.430 --> 01:33:03.940
I have a love hate relationship with conspiracies.
I love some of them.

1597
01:33:03.941 --> 01:33:05.770
Some of them are fascinating.
Some of them like,
okay,

1598
01:33:05.771 --> 01:33:10.330
what the fuck happened there?
You know?
But,
and then some of them like,

1599
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:12.380
I can't do this anymore.
Yeah,

1600
01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.340
I didn't when I was younger I used to think about it.

1601
01:33:15.341 --> 01:33:19.330
But then I think when I had a kid at,
well yeah,
I don't have time for that.

1602
01:33:19.570 --> 01:33:23.620
No time for nonsense and becomes very precious.

1603
01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:24.610
Becomes food.

1604
01:33:24.611 --> 01:33:29.470
How exactly not over here worrying about the fucking Illuminati.

1605
01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:33.010
I don't even know what that means.
What's the Illuminati?
Yeah,
exactly.
I'm busy.

1606
01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:37.300
I kind of go,
but I get how people get sucked into that rabbit hole.

1607
01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:42.550
No,
no,
no.
I could see it.
I went into a rabbit hole the other day,
but with aliens,

1608
01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:45.490
I watched three alien documentaries in a row.

1609
01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:50.890
I Rotch to this one on Bob Lasar who was a guy who claims that he worked at area

1610
01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:53.560
51 it's very compelling.
Very interesting.

1611
01:33:53.570 --> 01:33:56.080
Because at the top of us and when he would suggest yes,

1612
01:33:56.290 --> 01:33:59.280
that's the one I would suggest.
It's called area 51 you.
Oh,

1613
01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.780
Bob was our area 51 and flying saucers,
I think it's called.
It's on iTunes.

1614
01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:05.740
It's fucking good.

1615
01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:10.860
Take notes because there's some things that this guy knew that it's almost

1616
01:34:11.921 --> 01:34:16.300
certain that he worked where he said he worked did he worked at area 51 the

1617
01:34:16.301 --> 01:34:17.320
question becomes,

1618
01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:20.590
he told all the truth about all these things that have since been proven to be

1619
01:34:20.591 --> 01:34:23.380
true.
Um,
weird.
So he gave,

1620
01:34:23.381 --> 01:34:28.300
he gave first cut at those truths,
right?
Yeah,
long time ago too.

1621
01:34:28.301 --> 01:34:30.460
He came out about this like 30 years ago.

1622
01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.270
There was a Nevada tell her about this bibles or he would,
he would.

1623
01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:36.700
He was worried about his life.
Here's what happened.

1624
01:34:37.150 --> 01:34:42.150
Apparently the guy was working in this area doing research for whatever the

1625
01:34:43.601 --> 01:34:46.450
government wanted him to do at area 51 what he did there,
who knows,

1626
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:52.110
he gets fired from this job and then takes his friends to this viewing position

1627
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:58.100
in the mountains where they can see them flying,
flying saucers.

1628
01:34:58.310 --> 01:35:01.130
He was telling them they fly them out of this base.
I'm going to bring,

1629
01:35:01.131 --> 01:35:05.990
you guys were going to watch it.
He,
they videotape this on old school VHS tape.

1630
01:35:06.140 --> 01:35:10.730
You can see these flying saucers flying around area 51 and he says,

1631
01:35:10.731 --> 01:35:15.350
these are not not being piloted by a,
by aliens.

1632
01:35:15.380 --> 01:35:19.610
These are being piloted by human beings,
but that these are real devices.

1633
01:35:19.611 --> 01:35:20.870
These things are real.
There are,

1634
01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:25.880
it's a real vehicle and they got this real vehicle from some other,

1635
01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.630
some other civilization from somewhere in space and they had nine of them.

1636
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:31.730
It sounds like total horse shit when you hear it,

1637
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:35.690
but then you watch the video and so the questions come like how did he know that

1638
01:35:35.691 --> 01:35:37.880
they were going to be flying these things up there?

1639
01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.040
How do you know they were going to do them on Wednesdays?

1640
01:35:40.190 --> 01:35:42.860
How did he know where to where he could see it?
How did he know?

1641
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:44.750
How did he know about the biometric data?

1642
01:35:44.751 --> 01:35:48.060
How did he know about element one 15 he was talking about this element,

1643
01:35:48.061 --> 01:35:53.061
this manmade element that it's a real element that they've now identified,

1644
01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.320
but when he was talking about it in 1980 no one knew what the fuck he was

1645
01:35:57.321 --> 01:35:59.900
talking about.
Our 1984 whatever it was,
when he was,

1646
01:35:59.901 --> 01:36:02.000
when he first got interviewed about this.

1647
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:07.450
So when this guy is bringing this stuff up today and people are looking back at

1648
01:36:09.141 --> 01:36:12.020
all the different things that he said that have since been proven to be true,

1649
01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:15.980
especially the existence of area 51,
the,
the government had to,

1650
01:36:15.981 --> 01:36:17.450
at some point in time in the 90s,

1651
01:36:17.451 --> 01:36:21.740
they had to say that they own the base and say that it did,

1652
01:36:21.741 --> 01:36:25.640
did in fact exist so that they could broaden the,
uh,

1653
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:28.730
top secret area or the,
uh,
you know,

1654
01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:32.480
like there's a do not enter zone or they'll pull you over and arrest you if you

1655
01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:33.560
get past a certain spot.

1656
01:36:33.710 --> 01:36:37.910
They wanted to broaden that area so people couldn't be watching their crafts fly

1657
01:36:37.911 --> 01:36:40.640
around like Bob Lasar was.
And when they did that,

1658
01:36:40.641 --> 01:36:42.110
when they expanded the territory,

1659
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:45.230
that's when they had to actually admit that the base was real.

1660
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:48.800
So he was proven to be correct on so many different things that he said.

1661
01:36:48.860 --> 01:36:50.930
Like he explained how they get them out there,

1662
01:36:51.090 --> 01:36:56.090
explain what their research was and he said that they had these things that run

1663
01:36:56.301 --> 01:36:57.590
on some,

1664
01:36:57.620 --> 01:37:02.510
they manipulate gravity in some way and they're very small because these aliens

1665
01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:06.710
are very small little creatures.
Like a child,
like a eight 10 year old child.

1666
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:11.410
It makes you go,
what the fuck man?
Like I said,
he talked about,
he said,

1667
01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:13.910
well he saw them,
he knew how they operated.
Wow.

1668
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:18.170
The things that he knows that are true,
that that turned out to be true,

1669
01:37:18.171 --> 01:37:22.280
that how could he have known them if he didn't work at area 51 of the most

1670
01:37:22.281 --> 01:37:27.281
compelling aspects of it and the fact that area 51 was at one point in time by

1671
01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:31.850
the governments take it didn't exist and then it was like a legend.

1672
01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.500
And this was when he was talking about it.

1673
01:37:34.190 --> 01:37:37.960
And so watching this documentary and seeing this guy 30 years later,

1674
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:40.130
still basically saying exactly the same thing,

1675
01:37:40.131 --> 01:37:43.370
but with a bunch of things have been proved.
Have improvement.
Cynthia.
Yeah,

1676
01:37:43.371 --> 01:37:45.140
that is intense.
It's a trip,
man.

1677
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:50.330
I mean if the government really did at one point in time have some craft that it

1678
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:54.980
got from another planet,
what the fuck man.
But the thing is,

1679
01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:56.310
how would we take that?

1680
01:37:57.030 --> 01:38:00.090
How do you think people would take that if they found out?

1681
01:38:00.690 --> 01:38:01.680
How do you think they'd handle that?

1682
01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.390
If they really knew there was something that was so sophisticated that it can

1683
01:38:06.391 --> 01:38:09.390
visit us from another planet.
It could be here in minutes,

1684
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:14.060
land of the White House lawn and do whatever the fuck it wanted to.

1685
01:38:14.070 --> 01:38:14.830
You couldn't even shoot it.
Right.

1686
01:38:14.830 --> 01:38:16.300
<v 2>Bullets.
How would people take that?</v>

1687
01:38:16.330 --> 01:38:19.300
I think that people would just keep going on like with every other scare.

1688
01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.820
I think so,
yeah.
I think,
okay,
there's um,

1689
01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:25.750
there could be a media that's supposed to hit us.
Right,
right.
I mean,

1690
01:38:25.751 --> 01:38:28.380
how do people take it?
I mean,
that's what they're saying.
I think it could happen.

1691
01:38:28.450 --> 01:38:31.150
I think it would be a fuck fest in the streets.
Yeah.

1692
01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:35.130
What they say they say could happen.
I mean,
you know,
if he's saw one common yeah,

1693
01:38:35.140 --> 01:38:36.760
but I'm saying that if you saw one company,

1694
01:38:36.761 --> 01:38:39.310
because you don't see the alien coming,
if people realize,
yeah,
yeah,

1695
01:38:39.311 --> 01:38:43.930
these guys could show up.
Right.
I don't know.
I remember the conspiracy that,

1696
01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:46.390
um,
what I,
I remember I did remember that,

1697
01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:50.890
remember that when they would be like these booklets of like xerox stuff going

1698
01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:54.250
on,
like the one about aids and stuff like that.
Maybe that one.
Yeah.

1699
01:38:54.251 --> 01:38:56.090
That one had been gone for awhile.
The can,

1700
01:38:56.170 --> 01:39:01.030
the aids conspiracy doctors correctors memorandum.
Oh yeah,

1701
01:39:01.570 --> 01:39:03.160
yeah.
People used to hand those out.
Right.

1702
01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:05.920
Try and tell people that aids was a hoax,
not a hoax.

1703
01:39:05.921 --> 01:39:10.670
That it was like all this stuff memorized.
Got a government conspiracy.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1704
01:39:10.690 --> 01:39:13.810
That has one way out.
For a while,
I remember I was video,
I was,

1705
01:39:13.811 --> 01:39:18.160
maybe I was making copies and passing along guy that blew my mind.
Well,

1706
01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:18.930
there was a

1707
01:39:18.930 --> 01:39:21.810
<v 1>one doctor at one point in time that was trying to say that,</v>

1708
01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:26.460
that HIV does not cause aids and we had them on way back in the day.

1709
01:39:26.490 --> 01:39:28.500
Early on was that guy's name

1710
01:39:31.390 --> 01:39:35.140
Duesberg?
Dr Peter Duesberg?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1711
01:39:35.141 --> 01:39:36.670
That's what it is or am I just remembered it.

1712
01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:41.440
He is a professor at the University of California,

1713
01:39:41.441 --> 01:39:42.490
Berkeley I believe.

1714
01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:47.580
I think he's a Bot biologist and his take was that HIV does not cause aids.

1715
01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:52.480
That what causes AIDS is a compromised immune system and the HIV is actually a

1716
01:39:52.481 --> 01:39:55.540
weak virus and it shows up in the immune systems of people that are already

1717
01:39:55.541 --> 01:39:56.374
compromised.

1718
01:39:56.650 --> 01:39:59.860
That's why you're finding it in these people that it's not the cause of their

1719
01:39:59.861 --> 01:40:01.750
immune system being confidant compromise.

1720
01:40:01.751 --> 01:40:05.800
It's a symptom of it and that with these people are really dying from is there

1721
01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:11.520
their whole system being fucked up by drugs that either they're taking AZT,

1722
01:40:11.891 --> 01:40:15.280
which destroys their body.
You know,
it was a cancer medication,

1723
01:40:15.281 --> 01:40:18.670
like a chemotherapy that was so powerful is killing people quicker than the

1724
01:40:18.671 --> 01:40:23.671
cancer was and then they switched it over to using it with people that had aids

1725
01:40:23.891 --> 01:40:27.390
because in in the early days they would call aids the gay cancer.
Right,
right.

1726
01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:28.390
There was all these different,

1727
01:40:28.391 --> 01:40:30.670
like they were trying to figure out what it was and what it did.

1728
01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:35.830
And early on this guy was saying this and we had them on the podcast and people

1729
01:40:35.831 --> 01:40:38.100
got so mad there,

1730
01:40:38.130 --> 01:40:41.350
there were so mad that given this guy a platform to spread his,

1731
01:40:41.770 --> 01:40:45.730
his propaganda and his lies.
And I was like,
wow.
But he is a professor,

1732
01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:49.960
he has done like legitimate cancer research.
He's,
you know,
I mean,

1733
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:51.940
don't you want to listen to them?
And,
and I,

1734
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:56.170
I wanted to get someone on debate him,
but nobody wanted to debate him.

1735
01:40:56.171 --> 01:40:59.470
It was like trying to get someone to debate a Holocaust denier.
I can,

1736
01:40:59.570 --> 01:41:02.170
nobody wants to give them the platform and what he wants you to talk to him,

1737
01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:06.130
which I understand.
But those,
those kinds of,

1738
01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:10.480
I mean it's very highly unlikely that all these doctors are incorrect and her

1739
01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:14.980
hiding the fact that HIV,
you know,
and then now the fact that they've got these,

1740
01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:18.340
um,
HIV medications,
it basically,

1741
01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:21.570
they can take people and make them HIV negative now.
Right.

1742
01:41:21.850 --> 01:41:26.350
Didn't they have like a couple people have tested HIV negative after
medications?

1743
01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:31.060
Yeah.
I Dunno.
I'm too stupid.
Too stupid to understand what's really going on.

1744
01:41:31.410 --> 01:41:36.070
That's for me that I know that I'm like,
when I watched some of those things,

1745
01:41:36.071 --> 01:41:36.904
you know,
they,

1746
01:41:37.120 --> 01:41:40.690
some of them they like lead off with these statements and we all know and we

1747
01:41:40.691 --> 01:41:43.510
know this.
I'm like,
I don't,
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Yeah.

1748
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:48.790
There's too much to know.
Yeah.
Yeah.
How do we get in the subject of AIDS?

1749
01:41:49.210 --> 01:41:51.570
I don't know.
We're talking about conspiracy theories.
Oh yeah.

1750
01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:54.850
That was the one that I,
I that one,
that one when it was out back in what?

1751
01:41:54.851 --> 01:41:57.880
[inaudible] 89 or [inaudible] 88 when those little pamphlets are going around.

1752
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:59.110
Yeah.
I was like,
yeah,

1753
01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:03.060
well marijuana and conspiracies go together like cookies and milk.
Yeah,
yeah,

1754
01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.600
yeah.
There's nothing like we that starts your,

1755
01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:10.780
your gears turning and you started thinking that's where a lot of people start

1756
01:42:10.781 --> 01:42:13.300
thinking conspiracies are against them too.
All right.

1757
01:42:13.301 --> 01:42:15.850
You get high and they start thinking of the world's closing in on you.

1758
01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:18.430
Everybody's watching you.
Surveillance.

1759
01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:21.970
But do you don't probably don't feel like that when you get high.
No,
I'm okay.

1760
01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:26.110
Yeah.
Yeah,
I do.
Sometimes I kind of like it though.

1761
01:42:27.070 --> 01:42:30.250
You know why I like it?
Cause it ends and when it ends you feel great.

1762
01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:33.940
It's almost like a brutal brain workout.
Like you,

1763
01:42:33.941 --> 01:42:38.941
you'd go digging deep into your psyche and find out all the things you're scared

1764
01:42:39.101 --> 01:42:42.520
of.
Right?
Yeah.
No,
it's like it's work.
Yeah.
It's working.
Get a little work.

1765
01:42:42.521 --> 01:42:44.010
He like took a look at you say,
well,
you know,

1766
01:42:44.020 --> 01:42:47.230
I never thought about me from that angle before.
Yeah.
I like to do it.

1767
01:42:47.231 --> 01:42:50.720
I'm going to clean up mine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Clean up your shit.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1768
01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:51.940
Especially if you're,

1769
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:56.860
I think if you're in a high pressure job and you're very busy like I am,

1770
01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:57.821
I think those,

1771
01:42:57.821 --> 01:43:00.790
those little insights are very important because you could get caught up in your

1772
01:43:00.791 --> 01:43:04.300
own bullshit and what you're trying to do and not think of the impact you're

1773
01:43:04.301 --> 01:43:07.180
having on the people that are around you.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then,

1774
01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:11.810
then that marijuana goes,
hey,
wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you impact a lot of people.

1775
01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:15.640
Too many people,
especially with,
you know,
like you know,

1776
01:43:15.641 --> 01:43:19.060
cause I would have things where like in my philosophy might change or a little

1777
01:43:19.061 --> 01:43:21.530
thing and you're talking to a lot of people and like,

1778
01:43:21.550 --> 01:43:26.080
oh I don't know if I feel like that anymore.
Yeah,
yeah.

1779
01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:29.850
You could switch,
right?
Yeah.
You could definitely switch her opinions.
I do.

1780
01:43:29.930 --> 01:43:32.010
I switch my opinions.
I do too.
Yeah.

1781
01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:34.070
Well I don't know if there was anything wrong with that either.

1782
01:43:34.071 --> 01:43:37.480
And I think everybody should be more flexible with their opinion.

1783
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:40.150
I mean obviously there's opinions like rape is bad,

1784
01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:44.200
don't murder people don't steal.
Obviously those things,

1785
01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:45.910
normal stuff that everybody agrees on.

1786
01:43:46.210 --> 01:43:50.650
But then you get to a certain point and I think we get real married to the idea

1787
01:43:50.651 --> 01:43:54.500
of our being right and we get real married to the idea of winning an argument

1788
01:43:54.501 --> 01:43:55.334
with our opinions.

1789
01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.080
I think that's when things get kind of squirrely because then you start trying

1790
01:44:00.081 --> 01:44:04.580
to calculate an argument to make your position sound better rather than

1791
01:44:04.581 --> 01:44:06.530
considering your position for what it really is.

1792
01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:09.200
And then also being just try and,
yeah,

1793
01:44:09.201 --> 01:44:12.320
always trying to figure out and learn a little something.

1794
01:44:12.410 --> 01:44:14.900
Take something away from it.
Not to be a knee jerk.
That's the thing.

1795
01:44:14.901 --> 01:44:17.760
You don't want to be a knee jerk.
Right,
exactly.
Yeah.
You know what I want,

1796
01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:18.900
I went real,
uh,

1797
01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.910
back and forth on pretty recently is a universal basic income.

1798
01:44:23.230 --> 01:44:27.450
And I see this guy that uh,
a universal bank.
Yeah.
Andrew,
yeah.
Yeah.

1799
01:44:27.980 --> 01:44:31.310
These running for president down platform.
That's part of his platform.
Right,

1800
01:44:31.311 --> 01:44:35.090
right.
And uh,
I had him on the podcast,
really enjoyed talking to him.
Really,

1801
01:44:35.091 --> 01:44:37.430
really smart guy.
Very cool guy.
Um,

1802
01:44:37.460 --> 01:44:40.370
but when I'm talking to him and I'm thinking about it,
I'm like,

1803
01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:45.770
boy,
I don't even know if that's enough.
Like what,
what they're doing,

1804
01:44:45.771 --> 01:44:46.670
the idea behind it.

1805
01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:49.340
Like the idea is that automation's going to take all these jobs,

1806
01:44:50.690 --> 01:44:52.270
automated cars going to style.

1807
01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:55.280
It means it's going to like wipe out a shit load of jobs apparently.

1808
01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:59.630
And the idea is that if we don't have some form of universal basic income,

1809
01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.830
there's going to be chaos,
but having just some amount of money.

1810
01:45:03.831 --> 01:45:06.860
So that people have their needs taken care of.
You always have food.

1811
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:11.480
You always have shelter.
This you're taking care of now go pursue your happiness.

1812
01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:12.450
The,

1813
01:45:12.450 --> 01:45:16.270
the real problem with that though was who was it that we had the other day where

1814
01:45:16.271 --> 01:45:19.640
we were talking about um,
meaning about people.
One was it

1815
01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:21.510
<v 6>okay</v>

1816
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:25.820
<v 1>Nick Christakis is that it was people find meaning in their life.</v>

1817
01:45:26.190 --> 01:45:29.760
Who was that might be him.
I don't recall it but don't think it was,

1818
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:34.050
I think it was someone else.
Was it Ben Shapiro?
No,

1819
01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:38.010
I don't think it was,
but anyway,
whoever it was that we were talking about it,

1820
01:45:38.040 --> 01:45:41.520
we were saying that.
Does that give people a sense of meaning though?

1821
01:45:41.521 --> 01:45:45.090
Because people like,
like you for instance,
you,

1822
01:45:45.150 --> 01:45:49.860
you know your responsibility as a referee.
You know how significant it is.

1823
01:45:49.861 --> 01:45:52.890
You know,
you one of the best in the world when you're refereeing a high level

1824
01:45:52.891 --> 01:45:56.220
championship bout when the fighters find out that herb dean's a referee,

1825
01:45:56.221 --> 01:45:59.370
they get excited like a good one less thing I have to think about.

1826
01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:00.750
It's like you're,
you're,

1827
01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:05.560
you're putting so much of who you are into that job.
Do we know?

1828
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:12.420
I'm looking for a piece of it.
I don't know yet.
Sorry.
No worries.
But I mean,

1829
01:46:13.750 --> 01:46:18.150
look,
that's,
that's gigantic,
right?
I mean,
that's,
I know for you that that's,

1830
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:20.850
you take that very seriously.

1831
01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:24.550
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1832
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:28.880
<v 1>All right.
Maybe I guess talking about it was it?
No,
I don't think so.
Anyway.</v>

1833
01:46:29.330 --> 01:46:30.920
You have meaning,
you know,

1834
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:35.810
and what you do if you just got money to lay around and someone said,

1835
01:46:35.811 --> 01:46:38.950
well,
just go pursue your goals.
Okay.

1836
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:44.050
But I think what people really like to do when the really happy is make a living

1837
01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:47.990
doing something that has meaning,
but getting them to them.

1838
01:46:48.230 --> 01:46:49.710
I don't know if it would

1839
01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.370
<v 0>smooth things out if you just gave people money.
Yeah.</v>

1840
01:46:53.371 --> 01:46:55.320
I don't know how that would work.
I don't know how,

1841
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:58.410
I don't dare that when I saw him,
what he's talking about and I don't,

1842
01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:00.420
I don't like that one.
That's,

1843
01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:02.970
I'm not smart enough for that one to know how that's going to work.

1844
01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:08.120
But he seemed to think that there was a lot of ancillary benefits,

1845
01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:12.900
like things like he lowered crime rates lowered,

1846
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:15.990
you know that you would have lowered instances of disease,

1847
01:47:15.991 --> 01:47:20.991
lowered instances of people that were injured doing certain things.

1848
01:47:21.061 --> 01:47:25.110
Like if you had money and you made sure that people had a certain amount of

1849
01:47:25.111 --> 01:47:29.240
money,
it actually might cost the public less money.
I could,

1850
01:47:29.250 --> 01:47:31.980
I could see where he would come from with that because I think there's
something,

1851
01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.990
cause there's there,

1852
01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.570
there's a lot of people are probably met a lot of people who say that money

1853
01:47:36.571 --> 01:47:38.700
isn't everything and there's these things that mean this,

1854
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:42.990
but it's only once you get enough money where you can step off the off the

1855
01:47:42.991 --> 01:47:46.930
little hamster wheel,
the hamster wheel for a second to like start,
uh,

1856
01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:50.690
thinking about these other things.
Yeah.
Money's overwhelming,
man.
Yeah.

1857
01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.680
I mean if you don't have it,
it's over.

1858
01:47:52.710 --> 01:47:56.600
I remember when I first got a development deal when I was doing standup and I

1859
01:47:56.610 --> 01:48:00.850
got a big check and I just immediately felt like,
oh,

1860
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:04.920
like literally like a weight was lifted off my back.
Just a weight,

1861
01:48:05.190 --> 01:48:06.990
like I had a weight vest on.
I took it off.

1862
01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:12.860
Like now I don't have to worry about food or rent or gas or anything for like at

1863
01:48:15.300 --> 01:48:17.940
least a year.
Right,
right.
And I was like,
I don't know how to think about it.

1864
01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:20.940
And then I remember,
I think it God,
it feels so free.

1865
01:48:21.330 --> 01:48:24.990
It feels so different because most people's lives who are in debt,

1866
01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:30.130
most of the time they're there.
They have this constant fog of pressure.
Yeah,

1867
01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:34.950
yeah.
It's around them about those pills.
Those God damn bills are always there.

1868
01:48:34.951 --> 01:48:38.400
It's creeping on you.
And then you get credit cards and your Max.

1869
01:48:38.401 --> 01:48:41.430
Those motherfuckers out still trying to live these dreams that people are given

1870
01:48:41.431 --> 01:48:45.390
to you,
that you're supposed to have these like,
you know,
the symbols,
the status,

1871
01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.490
you know,
people trying to go like it's really,

1872
01:48:47.491 --> 01:48:50.310
and that's even weird because you know,
I'm not really into that stuff.

1873
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:51.720
But then again,
I'm on television,

1874
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:56.220
so I guess I can forward that to me.
I don't know.

1875
01:48:56.940 --> 01:48:58.870
Maybe that's why I like to think of them deep yet.
No,

1876
01:48:58.871 --> 01:49:01.570
I don't need a Mercedes man.
I'm just,
you know,
I would just drive it.

1877
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:04.480
You're just driving my car and my 2005,
you know,
that's,

1878
01:49:04.630 --> 01:49:07.440
I just need to get from point a to point B.
But you know,
maybe that's why,

1879
01:49:07.441 --> 01:49:11.070
I don't know.
I don't know man.
You said you have a 74 bronco too,

1880
01:49:11.071 --> 01:49:13.620
so you must appreciate.
Cool.
She did.
See that's what I'm saying.

1881
01:49:13.621 --> 01:49:16.050
But that's the thing.
I was about to get rid of it.
And my friend said,

1882
01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.390
cause I was like,
man,
it doesn't mean what it used to mean to me,

1883
01:49:18.570 --> 01:49:22.830
but I do appreciate it.
And now I'm like my friends like,
Hey,
I'm going to hook,

1884
01:49:22.831 --> 01:49:26.400
we're going to hook this thing up.
Ah.
So I was like,
all right,
I sent it to him.

1885
01:49:26.401 --> 01:49:29.370
He says,
I'm going to give you a deal.
We're going to get it all hooked up.
Right.

1886
01:49:29.371 --> 01:49:33.060
And uh,
but it does,
I've will admit that like before,

1887
01:49:33.061 --> 01:49:35.430
it meant a lot more to me than it does now.

1888
01:49:35.460 --> 01:49:38.580
Kevin Hart came over here with a bronco the other day and I saw his bronco.

1889
01:49:38.581 --> 01:49:43.170
Here's a red one.
His is better than mine.
Yours,
this tube,
his his dope.

1890
01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:47.130
His makes me realize how cool the convertibles are when they're,

1891
01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:50.730
they're done as convertibles.
Like he's just driving around with no top on.

1892
01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:53.520
I'm like,
aw,
that's so nice.
That's what,
that's how I'm doing mine.

1893
01:49:53.530 --> 01:49:56.290
Because I had gotten mine as a convertible and I wouldn't,
yeah,

1894
01:49:56.291 --> 01:49:58.390
I got a top cause I want to do a hard top on it.

1895
01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:03.550
But if you're taking it on and off,
that is,
that is a nasty bronco.
You know,

1896
01:50:03.551 --> 01:50:07.000
he has his own car company that does this shit.

1897
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:12.310
He does this shit with his own company.
He's got like a hundred businesses dude.

1898
01:50:12.311 --> 01:50:17.270
I never met anybody as motivational or motivated as Kevin Hart.
No,

1899
01:50:17.290 --> 01:50:18.580
I saw the,
I saw I,

1900
01:50:18.690 --> 01:50:22.940
I follow him on social media and that man is Yay.

1901
01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:26.470
And I saw what he was talking about,
you know,
talking to you about too.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1902
01:50:26.471 --> 01:50:27.700
He's,
he's very motivated.

1903
01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.840
He's the most authentically positive person I think I've ever met.

1904
01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:36.280
And look at that.
He's got an Eleanor Mustang.
That's a fucking beast,
man.

1905
01:50:36.580 --> 01:50:37.960
They made that at his place too.

1906
01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.160
So he has his own fucking car place that makes him cars.

1907
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:47.980
Look at that.
I mean the two,
it's off the charts,
but more importantly,

1908
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:53.200
look his outlook,
like his,
his healthy positive outlook and the way,

1909
01:50:53.230 --> 01:50:55.690
you know,
he just goes through life.

1910
01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:01.210
It's very inspirational to us all that it's very positive,
uplifting.

1911
01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:05.140
Like he saw that he was trying to help people and all these different facets of

1912
01:51:05.141 --> 01:51:07.060
life help people with financial advice,

1913
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:10.180
help with motivation to help people to get the bullshit out of their life,

1914
01:51:10.181 --> 01:51:12.470
get the clutter out of their life.
Yeah.
No,
I,
uh,

1915
01:51:12.850 --> 01:51:16.660
I even like when I first started really liking it was when he was,
uh,

1916
01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:20.590
doing that thing where he was meeting up with people to run the ad.
I was like,

1917
01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:24.010
man,
I like that.
I going like that as much as I travel.
And I used to like to run,

1918
01:51:24.011 --> 01:51:26.740
you know?
Well,
you could always do that.
Other people do that.

1919
01:51:26.770 --> 01:51:28.750
My friend Cameron Hanes does that all the time.

1920
01:51:28.930 --> 01:51:32.050
He'll invite people to run with him places.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1921
01:51:32.230 --> 01:51:35.140
My thing with the yoga is I've been decided to do it when I'm on the road,

1922
01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:37.200
so that's been cool.
Is I got to do it.
And um,

1923
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:41.290
you're going to Atlanta this weekend?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1924
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:45.010
But what the fuck does two,
not one,

1925
01:51:45.011 --> 01:51:49.300
two world championship fights.
Damn.
You didn't get invited to Atlanta.

1926
01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:53.830
Are they gonna use Atlanta guys?
I'm not sure,
but there's good Atlanta guy,

1927
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:58.450
a referee.
Blake Grice.
Blake Grice.
Yeah,
he's a good guy.

1928
01:51:58.870 --> 01:52:00.610
Um,
there's um,

1929
01:52:00.910 --> 01:52:05.230
isn't that Matt Grice's a brother hazy?
I didn't know that.
I don't,

1930
01:52:05.231 --> 01:52:08.860
I think one of the referee,
he's,
what's his name?
Who's old?
So sometimes they use,

1931
01:52:08.861 --> 01:52:11.110
what's your memory of that fighter?
Uh,

1932
01:52:11.111 --> 01:52:15.970
he used to have the black dude with a,
like a patch of gray here,

1933
01:52:15.971 --> 01:52:19.650
but that like a strict is it makes it here look real cool.
What's his name is?
Um,

1934
01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:24.430
there's a really good fighter.
Uh,
his son fights him.
It may now.

1935
01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:27.310
He came from a kickboxing background.

1936
01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:28.910
I don't know why I'm drawing a blank on his name.

1937
01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:32.710
This is embarrassing because it's embarrassing because he's going to be mad at

1938
01:52:32.711 --> 01:52:37.220
me like,
like you don't know me.
I know him.
He fill it old right now.
All right.

1939
01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:40.030
That's the weed hanging out with Joey Diaz will fuck your head.

1940
01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:41.070
I'm couple months.

1941
01:52:44.100 --> 01:52:47.500
Joey's podcasts.
No,
it was like,
it was probably a couple of years ago.
Oh,
okay.

1942
01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:50.690
But it was fun.
I'm recovered.
I'm saying.
Yeah Dude.
He,

1943
01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:53.330
he'll change your life over in that weird room.

1944
01:52:54.110 --> 01:52:58.610
It gives people those stars a death.
I know you have 250 milligrams of THC.

1945
01:52:59.270 --> 01:53:03.440
That's crazy.
250 milligrams.
Yeah.
That's crazy.

1946
01:53:03.441 --> 01:53:08.200
That is a crazy amount.
Yeah.
That's not right.
No,

1947
01:53:08.300 --> 01:53:09.133
no,
it's fine.

1948
01:53:12.580 --> 01:53:15.080
I'm still trying to think of this guy's name.
Yeah,

1949
01:53:15.081 --> 01:53:18.680
I know you are trying to jostle your memory in some way.
We'll come back.

1950
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:22.680
We'll come back to it.
Yeah.
Um,
there's a lot of guys who,
uh,

1951
01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:27.200
our former fighters that,
that I think frank Triggs doing referee work now,

1952
01:53:27.650 --> 01:53:30.770
you know?
Yeah,
yeah.
Frank Triggs.
Really good.

1953
01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:33.020
I would like more guys do that and I would,

1954
01:53:33.110 --> 01:53:37.250
I would love to have more former fighters.
Be Judges,
you know,

1955
01:53:37.251 --> 01:53:40.580
who I saw who was really good,
uh,
who came and took my course is um,

1956
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:44.750
Chris Liebing.
Yeah.
[inaudible] good referee.
While he's doing,

1957
01:53:44.751 --> 01:53:48.170
he's been doing stuff in Camo and he's,
he's coming along.
He's doing it.
Yeah.

1958
01:53:48.290 --> 01:53:52.720
Nice.
Yeah.
He just won in a bare knuckle boxing.
I saw,
I saw,
I saw some clips.

1959
01:53:52.721 --> 01:53:55.310
I'll bet it was.
Yeah.
I mean it does look good.
Yeah.

1960
01:53:55.340 --> 01:54:00.110
Well it's good for him with his style,
his crazy style.
That's a,

1961
01:54:00.111 --> 01:54:02.810
that's actually a great move for him,
you know.

1962
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:05.930
But he retired from finding cause he didn't want to fight anymore.

1963
01:54:05.960 --> 01:54:09.320
I mean he just,
but I guess a little bit of time off and he's like,
fuck it.

1964
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:10.400
You know,

1965
01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:13.220
there was two organizations that used to be a different bare knuckle boxing,

1966
01:54:13.221 --> 01:54:17.020
but they went under and when they went under they owe him like 90,000.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1967
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:21.950
They cheated.
They,
oh yeah.
That's rough in his recourses.

1968
01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:26.600
Just let people know.
Yeah,
these guys owe me money.
Did you see the clip that uh,

1969
01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:31.420
um,
uh,
Crooklyn from a Kirkland on,

1970
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:36.430
on Twitter put up of I'm the owner of bare knuckle boxing saying that a fighter

1971
01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.530
didn't fight hard enough.
Yeah,
I saw that.
Yeah.
I um,

1972
01:54:43.230 --> 01:54:45.830
and,
and he was proud of it.
He's like,
this is the way we do it.

1973
01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:48.230
See if you can find her tweet.
Yeah.
This is the way we do it.

1974
01:54:48.860 --> 01:54:52.010
This is what you can,
hey.
Yeah,
that was ridiculous.

1975
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:54.020
And you're just going to a guys pay.
Yeah.

1976
01:54:54.210 --> 01:54:57.070
So he's getting it took 50% of his money cause it didn't meet.
Yeah.

1977
01:54:57.071 --> 01:54:59.450
Cause it didn't meet his standards.
Yeah.
I just,

1978
01:54:59.710 --> 01:55:03.950
I want him when he said did the crowd chair that I sorry.
I hope not.

1979
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:09.590
I'd hate to see that some of the crowd could cheer for it to the president.

1980
01:55:10.160 --> 01:55:15.020
I'll up bare knuckle fighting.
Was it as Mr. David Feldman,
he looks,
he's on coke.

1981
01:55:15.290 --> 01:55:16.123
Look at them.
At least

1982
01:55:16.620 --> 01:55:18.860
<v 7>I'll see you guys having fun tonight.
Make some noise.</v>

1983
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:23.320
No fighting KP.

1984
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:27.760
A tip as a brand new sport in a brand new company and we're here for action.

1985
01:55:27.970 --> 01:55:31.490
And we want action and we demand action from the fighter.

1986
01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:36.190
The man didn't get accident that last quite could rusty crowd or one of the run.

1987
01:55:36.610 --> 01:55:41.610
Therefore he's given a half this Perth to Reggie Barnett make some noise blocks.

1988
01:55:41.931 --> 01:55:43.640
He,
this is how we do it.
A bear

1989
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.140
<v 0>you fight or you don't get paid.</v>

1990
01:55:50.580 --> 01:55:51.540
That's not good.

1991
01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:56.460
It's not good that he thinks the Zombie Prophet wrote this can't be legal.

1992
01:55:56.640 --> 01:56:01.380
He was,
see what Stephie Hayes wrote?
Uh,
Crooklyn MMA.

1993
01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:02.433
How that works.

1994
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:08.070
She's lucky if she wrote what the actual fuck is this hillbilly?
The whole chair?

1995
01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:14.520
Uh,
yeah.
I concur.

1996
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:18.060
What in the actual fuck is that hillbilly bullshit?
The now I'm pride.

1997
01:56:18.061 --> 01:56:20.940
They used to dock,
right?
The yellow car was a yellow card.

1998
01:56:20.941 --> 01:56:24.030
Is a penalty penalty for being boring.
Most of them were.
Yeah.

1999
01:56:24.180 --> 01:56:28.260
And sometimes irresponsibly.
I,
I've watched some of those yellow cards.
I'm like,

2000
01:56:28.261 --> 01:56:31.370
you crazy.
You crazy.
Take that back.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2001
01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:34.110
You gave that guy a yellow car.
He can't fight me harder.
Like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

2002
01:56:34.111 --> 01:56:36.900
yeah,
yeah.
We can't engage.
He's going to get lit up and these,

2003
01:56:36.901 --> 01:56:39.780
this moments we have to try to figure out what the fuck to do.

2004
01:56:39.990 --> 01:56:43.970
You're on the outside to try to figure out how to get in and you getting lit and

2005
01:56:43.971 --> 01:56:47.020
then the ref is like caught fight,
fight and you're like,
but in Asia,

2006
01:56:47.021 --> 01:56:48.540
at some of them they like,
some of them are,

2007
01:56:48.720 --> 01:56:52.440
I used to work a lot at this Korean shell and they changed their figuring out

2008
01:56:52.441 --> 01:56:54.810
their style.
But man,
when I first got to,
they're like,
um,

2009
01:56:55.080 --> 01:56:56.220
so there's a yellow card.

2010
01:56:56.250 --> 01:57:00.930
Any backward step backstep any backstep you should,

2011
01:57:00.931 --> 01:57:03.930
we move on to you to give a yellow card.
And I was like,

2012
01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:06.720
Leo Machida would never make any money.
That's what I'm saying.

2013
01:57:06.721 --> 01:57:08.850
I don't know if I can do it that I don't think that's,

2014
01:57:08.851 --> 01:57:11.830
I mean you invited me over here for a reason.
I'm,
I'm,

2015
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:14.010
I'm just going to do what I do and hope you bring me back.

2016
01:57:14.340 --> 01:57:17.700
But I don't know if I can do that.
Yeah.
Good for you.
Yeah.
Do.

2017
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.740
Do you ever go to a place and the commissions or a promoter will tell you,

2018
01:57:22.741 --> 01:57:24.630
hey,
fights,
go to the ground.

2019
01:57:24.631 --> 01:57:26.790
I want you to give it just a couple of seconds and stand them up.

2020
01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:30.930
I go places and people telling me what to do all the time and I'm not going to

2021
01:57:30.931 --> 01:57:33.060
do it because we came at the end of the day.

2022
01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:35.070
No one's going to know that you told me to do it.

2023
01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:39.960
It's going to be me doing it 100%.
Yeah.
So I'm going to,

2024
01:57:39.961 --> 01:57:43.470
um,
yeah,
I can't,
I can't.
Um,
yeah.
Basically.

2025
01:57:43.471 --> 01:57:45.990
So glad you just said it that way too.
Cause that's,
that's,

2026
01:57:45.991 --> 01:57:49.770
people need to get that in their head because I know that sometimes people do

2027
01:57:49.771 --> 01:57:54.771
get affected by whether they want to please a promoter or please a crowd or,

2028
01:57:54.990 --> 01:57:58.410
and they're not doing the right thing.
It's such a tremendous responsibility.

2029
01:57:58.410 --> 01:58:01.550
Yeah.
You're going to be,
but you're the one who's going to be a,

2030
01:58:01.590 --> 01:58:04.770
for some of those choices,
you know,
those choices that they made,

2031
01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:09.450
they're making those choices with your name,
so yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
It's yeah,

2032
01:58:09.451 --> 01:58:14.160
like the backstep Kevin Johnson answering the guy,

2033
01:58:14.190 --> 01:58:17.790
but this is a tweet from that bare knuckle fc.
Okay.
Kevin Johnson.

2034
01:58:17.791 --> 01:58:19.740
No money was taken from any fighters.

2035
01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:22.290
That statement did exactly what it's supposed to,

2036
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:26.910
what it was supposed it didn't say to suppose and lit a fire under every single

2037
01:58:26.911 --> 01:58:31.890
fighters ass from that point on giving you one of the greatest fights you'll

2038
01:58:31.891 --> 01:58:35.520
ever see.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2039
01:58:35.521 --> 01:58:40.470
Those guys fought that way because that's who the fuck they are.
Right,
right.

2040
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:41.650
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2041
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:45.790
<v 1>No,
there's no,
I had nothing to do with that.</v>

2042
01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:50.620
Jason Knight and autumn low ball fight.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
You can't,

2043
01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:55.680
you can't claim credit for a hint for Jason Knight doing what he did.

2044
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:58.810
They are the low ball fuck outta here.

2045
01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:02.080
They would fight that way in a fucking Walmart parking lot.

2046
01:59:02.530 --> 01:59:04.710
That's how those guys would fight every time they fight there.

2047
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:08.590
Jason Knight is the both those dudes animals.
Those dudes are so tough.

2048
01:59:08.650 --> 01:59:13.270
Jason Knight has my favorite nickname.
Hick Diaz.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

2049
01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:19.910
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It's like a bad mother fucker.

2050
01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:22.390
He's a bad motherfucker that,

2051
01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.260
but it was tough looking at their faces after the fight.
I was like,
man,

2052
01:59:26.261 --> 01:59:29.260
I might have to rethink my position on,
on bare knuckle fights.

2053
01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:34.390
Look at their faces afterwards.
Yeah.
I mean that is crazy.

2054
01:59:35.110 --> 01:59:39.740
You know,
it's a lifetime of cuts all over the,
if I'm looking at is,

2055
01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:42.450
is right under his nose.
That's

2056
01:59:44.530 --> 01:59:48.310
crazy.
Cut Man.
He stitched,
stitched the fuck up all over the place.

2057
01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:52.930
That is rough man.
His whole face got lacerated.

2058
01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:56.990
I mean that is a lot of cuts.
Yeah.

2059
01:59:57.750 --> 02:00:00.820
That's more like a Moyie Thai fight and it really makes you think,

2060
02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:06.280
but I can,
um,
that's got to be the most brutal,
right?
More time.
Yeah,
I believe so.

2061
02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:08.770
Mostly type bare knuckle would be like,
what do they call it?

2062
02:00:08.771 --> 02:00:10.530
Left way where they just stay.

2063
02:00:10.531 --> 02:00:14.980
They kind of like wrap the hands up and a hand wrap.
Yeah.
It's not bare knuckle,

2064
02:00:14.981 --> 02:00:18.490
but it's um,
I think a bare,

2065
02:00:18.550 --> 02:00:21.980
bare knuckle moitai would be the hardest.
But the thing what a,

2066
02:00:21.981 --> 02:00:24.820
my argument was always,
and it still remains this,

2067
02:00:25.090 --> 02:00:27.190
that if you're not going to pad anything else,

2068
02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.560
like you're not going to pad the shins,
you're not going to bad the knees,

2069
02:00:29.561 --> 02:00:32.080
are they all both?
Why are you patting the knuckles?

2070
02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:36.850
You're just giving people a false sense of security in terms of what is actually

2071
02:00:36.851 --> 02:00:39.310
effective.
We don't want,

2072
02:00:40.630 --> 02:00:44.290
we don't want to practice something that doesn't really work if you don't have

2073
02:00:44.291 --> 02:00:47.950
gloves on.
Right.
I mean,
if every time you punch someone,
you don't have gloves on,

2074
02:00:47.951 --> 02:00:51.820
your hand would break.
And we do.
Okay.
We clearly can't punch people.
It's stupid.

2075
02:00:51.821 --> 02:00:55.450
You got to use elbows and knees and you gotta do something.
Right,
right,
right.

2076
02:00:55.510 --> 02:01:00.510
So in order to fight with your knuckles as much as UFC fighters do,

2077
02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:05.890
you pat everything you pad,
you put raps,
you put padding over it.

2078
02:01:05.891 --> 02:01:09.760
Boxing is like,
it's a different world.
As soon as you take gloves off,

2079
02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:13.470
it's a different world.
Punches get in that you can't block it.

2080
02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:16.570
It's way more consequence.
A lot of more cuts.

2081
02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.790
But at least if now we know what actually works.

2082
02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:23.210
Right.
I see what you're saying.

2083
02:01:23.211 --> 02:01:26.140
I wasn't thinking about it from that point of view.
Yeah,
that has given people,

2084
02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:29.590
people were thinking that,
ah,
yeah,
you're right.

2085
02:01:29.591 --> 02:01:32.200
Like people would think that boxing well before him May,
may everything.

2086
02:01:32.201 --> 02:01:34.360
It was the most effective way of doing things.

2087
02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:39.010
But then when you a MMA is a whole different,

2088
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:40.370
the size of the boxing

2089
02:01:40.370 --> 02:01:43.400
<v 0>glove of the techniques you can do and what you can't do and what's gonna work</v>

2090
02:01:43.401 --> 02:01:44.830
and what's not going to work.
It's,

2091
02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:49.790
it's supposed to be the sport of fighting and you've basically brought it down

2092
02:01:49.791 --> 02:01:50.780
to a raw form,

2093
02:01:50.781 --> 02:01:55.190
but you're still covering the knuckles and padding the knuckles just because of

2094
02:01:55.191 --> 02:01:58.100
perception and see the problem with that guy,

2095
02:01:58.190 --> 02:02:02.600
this bare knuckle boxing guy when he says some stupid shit like that is that it

2096
02:02:02.601 --> 02:02:07.040
reinforces what people don't like about combat sports.

2097
02:02:07.370 --> 02:02:10.850
What people don't like about the idea of bare knuckle boxing,

2098
02:02:10.851 --> 02:02:14.780
that it's brutal and it's just there for chaos and write,
write,
write,
write,

2099
02:02:14.781 --> 02:02:17.210
write,
come for action.
We're here to see action.

2100
02:02:17.330 --> 02:02:19.880
That guy's people think that about him.
He May.
Yeah.
And,
and,

2101
02:02:19.930 --> 02:02:24.380
and I don't think that,
um,
I don't think that a MMA athletes,

2102
02:02:24.381 --> 02:02:28.700
I think a MMA athletes I think are the most honorable and,

2103
02:02:29.190 --> 02:02:32.780
uh,
well behaved and you know,

2104
02:02:32.781 --> 02:02:35.680
not because of fear anything because of what the sport is.
Yeah.

2105
02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:39.430
You can get it out of like,
I mean,
people they know event,
you know,
that they're,

2106
02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:43.280
it could,
because our aggressive nature is being put in a channeled,

2107
02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:46.400
channeled in a,
in an organized way to make sense.

2108
02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:49.160
I'll tell you one of the most aggressive,
I run around the Rose Bowl.

2109
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:51.740
When I see the Peloton come around,

2110
02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:54.680
that's when the most aggressive things I've seen men,

2111
02:02:54.681 --> 02:02:58.010
those dudes are constantly cursing each other out and curse and everybody else

2112
02:02:58.011 --> 02:03:01.160
out,
a little soccer moms out there trying to run around the rose bowl.

2113
02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:05.870
But the guys,
the man,
oh,
but the guy's throwing punches or never,
you know,

2114
02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:09.730
cursing people out.
So the runners,
no,
no.
What do you mean?

2115
02:03:09.731 --> 02:03:14.060
What's a Peloton as the guys on the bikes?
But isn't that like,
Oh,

2116
02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:17.830
I thought Peloton u stands still.
I don't know.
I was making it,
I'm not talking,

2117
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:21.500
I'm talking about the guys at the Rose Bowl.
It's really,
know what I'm saying.

2118
02:03:21.501 --> 02:03:23.270
They'll come,
they'll train there.
Oh,

2119
02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:28.250
when they come out and they train with a riding stationary bikes riding
together,

2120
02:03:28.340 --> 02:03:31.970
the riding together and they're out there racing.
No,
their,

2121
02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.270
their training and then there's some aggressive,

2122
02:03:35.271 --> 02:03:37.630
those dudes are aggressive because they're cutting each other off and shins.

2123
02:03:37.631 --> 02:03:40.400
And maybe just maybe just to follow the rules.
Right.
Or just the,

2124
02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:43.820
there's the word Peloton,
which means a group of cyclists.
It's not the same as,

2125
02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:48.950
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Oh,
okay.
So the cyclist cows on based off of it,

2126
02:03:48.951 --> 02:03:52.370
cause I didn't think I'd use the word [inaudible].
I was like,
Whoa,
wait a minute.

2127
02:03:52.490 --> 02:03:55.430
Wait a minute.
I thought I used a big word and make a mistake.
I'll go to,
okay.

2128
02:03:56.080 --> 02:03:58.910
All right.
Okay.
So these people,

2129
02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:02.510
they're racing and they're cussing each other out.
They're training.
Oh,

2130
02:04:02.511 --> 02:04:05.240
so not racing.
They just trained together on the [inaudible] training.
And again,

2131
02:04:05.350 --> 02:04:08.420
that's at the Rose Bowl.
Okay.
You've been to the rose bowl,
right.
You know the,

2132
02:04:08.421 --> 02:04:12.240
the,
there's a running loop.
You go in and you can get it in five k around it.

2133
02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:14.690
Like,
yeah,
those dudes are intense.

2134
02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:17.900
Really way more intense than I see our athlete tactics.

2135
02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:21.080
Well because there's not as much consequences.
Right.
You know,

2136
02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:24.500
they're not going to get off the pike,
compete each other's asses,
talk shit.

2137
02:04:24.590 --> 02:04:25.970
Really.
I bet they are.

2138
02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:29.120
Well it's like one time I wish one of them would have come back and then he said

2139
02:04:31.010 --> 02:04:35.630
it's like road rage.
Right?
You get road ragey when you're in your car.

2140
02:04:35.720 --> 02:04:38.190
I was like,
your workout done.
Don't do another lap

2141
02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:41.250
<v 2>looking for you.
That's at the Rose Bowl.
Oh,
okay.</v>

2142
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:45.060
And so they get mad at each other cause they're trying to past tense.

2143
02:04:45.080 --> 02:04:47.760
It's like it's aggressive maybe cause there's some rules to it I think.

2144
02:04:47.970 --> 02:04:49.250
I think there's like probably way here,

2145
02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:52.710
there's probably a lot of structure as to riding in a pack like that.
Right.

2146
02:04:52.890 --> 02:04:56.380
And then also they're trying to get their workout in and they're on the,
and the,

2147
02:04:56.381 --> 02:04:59.280
and then there's other people out there trying to do other stuff and they're

2148
02:04:59.281 --> 02:05:03.420
really serious about there's,
I mean,
you know,
it's aggressive.

2149
02:05:06.460 --> 02:05:06.981
Maybe I,

2150
02:05:06.981 --> 02:05:09.840
maybe it's just shocking to me because it doesn't look like it would be that

2151
02:05:09.841 --> 02:05:12.180
aggressive.
Because when you think about fighters,

2152
02:05:12.181 --> 02:05:14.100
like especially guys even training together,

2153
02:05:14.130 --> 02:05:17.400
it's rare that they swear at each other.
Talk Shit to me.

2154
02:05:17.401 --> 02:05:20.360
Like if two guys get in an argument,
like if someone,
a guy doesn't let go,

2155
02:05:20.380 --> 02:05:22.980
somebody tapped and people scream or something like that.
Yeah.

2156
02:05:22.981 --> 02:05:25.200
And so that's the other thing.
I think that's why the respect has,

2157
02:05:25.201 --> 02:05:26.370
because there'd be get better.

2158
02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:30.360
You have to put yourself in situations where you're going to have,

2159
02:05:30.361 --> 02:05:32.520
where you're going to be at a disadvantage and vulnerable.

2160
02:05:32.670 --> 02:05:36.360
And so you have to trust your training partners to have this level of respect

2161
02:05:36.361 --> 02:05:40.530
and you're going to have to reciprocate that with things like leg locks.
Yes,

2162
02:05:40.531 --> 02:05:44.260
exactly.
You gotta be really careful to let go quick and man,

2163
02:05:44.261 --> 02:05:47.490
this leg lock game that people are doing now.
Today,
I need to learn it.

2164
02:05:47.550 --> 02:05:49.940
I don't know.
Yeah.
See that's the thing.
I know,

2165
02:05:49.941 --> 02:05:54.120
I used to think I was good at like Luxe and uh,
these days.
So simple.
Yeah.
Yeah,

2166
02:05:54.121 --> 02:05:56.410
yeah.
And,
and then,
uh,
I guess because,
you know,

2167
02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:58.680
I guess it wouldn't take much to do,
we get a leg locks,

2168
02:05:58.690 --> 02:06:00.540
you just have to be willing to do them back in the day.
Right.

2169
02:06:00.570 --> 02:06:03.950
Everybody else was like,
no,
no,
no.
It's the,
yeah.
Yeah.
So,

2170
02:06:04.170 --> 02:06:07.570
but he used to be like a simple setup.
Yeah.
You dive in the heel,
Hook Taiwan,

2171
02:06:07.590 --> 02:06:12.530
a toe hold now.
Yeah.
Very intense.
Yeah.
And do so other studios,

2172
02:06:12.531 --> 02:06:14.610
so some people were getting it,
they were doing other things.
Yeah.

2173
02:06:14.611 --> 02:06:18.000
Like maybe the way they hide their feet are the way they do this kind of say

2174
02:06:18.001 --> 02:06:23.001
that the first guy in modern MMA that started really wrecking people with leg

2175
02:06:23.851 --> 02:06:28.380
locks with MNR.
Yeah.
And then Paul Harris,
who MNR and Paul Harris,

2176
02:06:28.530 --> 02:06:30.660
those are the two guys.
I remember George Greer Gel.

2177
02:06:30.930 --> 02:06:35.040
He fought him and ran him and I ripped his fucking knee apartment.
And you know,

2178
02:06:35.100 --> 02:06:38.350
Kurt Chels,
a Brazilian Jujitsu Brown,
he was a very early in the fight him.

2179
02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:41.670
He just did that Amun Ra role,
just dove on the knee and next thing you know,

2180
02:06:41.671 --> 02:06:45.790
he's got you in a fucking inverted,
he'll hook.
And then Paul,
Horace,
anything,
he,

2181
02:06:46.050 --> 02:06:50.310
you can't defend this.
Like he's too strong.
He's too strong.
So he can do,

2182
02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:54.990
he can do and ways build.
He can do a lot of stuff that just doesn't make sense.

2183
02:06:55.090 --> 02:06:59.040
I remember we had that guy against the cage on a single this like nobody's

2184
02:06:59.041 --> 02:07:02.670
worried about it.
He'll have a leg lock from there.
Boom.
Inverted those legs,

2185
02:07:02.671 --> 02:07:07.530
grab him.
You're not going anywhere.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He was devastating.

2186
02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:12.240
He didn't let go and he would really,

2187
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:16.230
really mangle your fucking knee.
Right?
Yeah.
So like that's when like,

2188
02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:19.850
I remember when they,
uh,
cause I,
I got the referee him,
uh,

2189
02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:22.410
in Brazil before he was doing a lot in the UFC.

2190
02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:25.090
And so I kind of seen him and like a,

2191
02:07:25.130 --> 02:07:28.170
I think one of the might've been a tournament format and I've never had any

2192
02:07:28.171 --> 02:07:32.820
problem.
But um,
you know,
he usually,
he stopped when I told him to,
you know,

2193
02:07:33.060 --> 02:07:36.070
but other than that one fight of from,

2194
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.370
<v 1>I think it was from Brazil or he's got some money in a leg lock and he's not</v>

2195
02:07:39.371 --> 02:07:42.640
letting go and,
and,
and I think it's a leg lock,

2196
02:07:44.170 --> 02:07:46.690
see if he could find it.
But it's a,
it's an early fight in his crib,

2197
02:07:46.691 --> 02:07:47.501
but it's crazy.

2198
02:07:47.501 --> 02:07:49.810
Like they're like trying to pull him off the guy and he's not letting her know

2199
02:07:50.110 --> 02:07:54.670
like a,
like a pit bull.
Right,
right.
Yeah.
He's so strong,
so strong.

2200
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:59.200
And apparently his upbringing was horrific.
Yeah.
Like I heard he had a tough,

2201
02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:01.000
he's like,
you know,
it's weird.
It's like,

2202
02:08:01.001 --> 02:08:04.720
cause you see that behavior and I only see him,
he seems like he,
you know,

2203
02:08:04.730 --> 02:08:07.140
some people have a cool energy when they're just around.
Yeah.

2204
02:08:07.160 --> 02:08:10.330
It always makes me smile when I see.
Yeah.
But I don't smile when I see that.

2205
02:08:10.331 --> 02:08:14.110
I mean,
you know what I mean?
But he's one of those guys that's like soft spoken,

2206
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:19.120
easy going.
Yeah.
I think something happens to that guy when he engages,

2207
02:08:19.390 --> 02:08:23.860
you know,
when you're in locked in mortal combat,
he becomes just pure savage.

2208
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:25.840
Yeah.
And He,
I mean,

2209
02:08:25.841 --> 02:08:29.320
he does leg locks that no one else does because no one else is strong enough to

2210
02:08:29.321 --> 02:08:32.020
do,
to have those legs that just when he,
you know what I mean?

2211
02:08:32.021 --> 02:08:35.300
He doesn't care if both legs or their arms in there anything to it.

2212
02:08:35.850 --> 02:08:40.660
It's all crap.
It's all getting trash compacted,

2213
02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:45.160
you know?
Um,
he had a very interesting grappling match with Gary Tonin.

2214
02:08:45.161 --> 02:08:49.030
Did you ever see that?
I did see that.
Yeah,
I did.
I saw some clips of it,

2215
02:08:49.031 --> 02:08:52.900
like some bits of it.
Yeah.
It really shows you how good Gary,
Tony,
yeah.
He's,

2216
02:08:52.901 --> 02:08:57.640
because Paul Harris is so much bigger than him.
I mean,
he's probably 40,

2217
02:08:57.641 --> 02:09:02.050
50 pounds heavier than him.
He's much bigger than him,
you know,
and um,

2218
02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:05.860
to watch those guys go back and forth,
it was really,
really interesting.
Yeah.

2219
02:09:05.861 --> 02:09:10.750
Well,
yeah,
Tony,
like he's,
he can,
and he's one of those people who can get,

2220
02:09:10.810 --> 02:09:13.390
you know,
you get a position,
but it's still just so hard to,

2221
02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:16.830
so he can just move away,
you know?
Well,

2222
02:09:16.840 --> 02:09:20.260
his grappling so elite and he's getting really good at striking now too.

2223
02:09:20.261 --> 02:09:22.870
And he's really dedicated to MMA and he's undefeated.

2224
02:09:22.900 --> 02:09:27.610
He's been fighting in one FC,
which I'm excited.
I'm very excited about one FC.

2225
02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:28.750
I love what they're doing.

2226
02:09:28.780 --> 02:09:32.230
I love the attitude that they're taking of making it about respect and martial

2227
02:09:32.231 --> 02:09:35.110
arts and bringing it to like some old school martial arts values.

2228
02:09:35.530 --> 02:09:38.290
They're fucking gigantic right now in Asia.

2229
02:09:38.630 --> 02:09:41.560
They put on great fights and they have the best fighter in the world.

2230
02:09:41.620 --> 02:09:43.030
They have Demetrius mighty mouse.
John,

2231
02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:47.240
what's really is what's really cool is because there's a lot of guys in Asia who

2232
02:09:47.241 --> 02:09:49.120
were really exciting to watch at that weight.

2233
02:09:49.121 --> 02:09:52.460
So it's kind of exciting to see him get over there with all these guys that,

2234
02:09:52.461 --> 02:09:55.420
that's,
I'm really excited about it.
Well,
he got tested in his first fight.

2235
02:09:55.450 --> 02:09:59.640
I mean he won by submission,
but he got tested and um,
uh,

2236
02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:04.150
Alvar has got stopped by that Russian dude.
Timothy.
What?
His,
his,
uh,

2237
02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:09.130
his last name,
the guy that stopped a Goddamn,
and I forget his name,

2238
02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:13.420
he got stopped.
Eddie Alvarez.
Timothy.
It's Timothy.
Not Timothy.

2239
02:10:13.450 --> 02:10:17.650
It's some strange Russian name.
Timothy.
No,
I don't remember his last name.

2240
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:23.650
But anyway,
he's a beast.
That's the UCAN.
Yeah.
Yeah,

2241
02:10:23.651 --> 02:10:25.240
that's right.
Nasties in his last name.

2242
02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:29.350
Nasty Ucan or the first letters of his last name.
Right.
Nasty.

2243
02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:34.070
Timofey nasty.
You can,
did you see that fight?
No.
Play the stoppage.

2244
02:10:34.340 --> 02:10:38.730
Play the uh,
the knockout,
the far,
far right one?
No,
the far right.

2245
02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:44.810
That one right there.
Ooh.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Just play right there.

2246
02:10:44.860 --> 02:10:49.480
There you go.
This dude is a,
this Russian cats,
a beast,
man.
He,

2247
02:10:49.610 --> 02:10:51.650
he was very seasoned in their,

2248
02:10:51.651 --> 02:10:56.150
like really relentless with his pressure and super confident in his power and he

2249
02:10:56.151 --> 02:10:59.270
stunned Alvarez a couple times in that fight.
I was pretty shocked.

2250
02:10:59.930 --> 02:11:04.280
I think there are a lot of guys that aren't in the UFC that are capable of

2251
02:11:04.281 --> 02:11:08.750
fighting in the UFC.
That's what I'm saying.
So like definitely there,

2252
02:11:08.751 --> 02:11:11.800
there's um,
all,
uh,

2253
02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:14.420
I get to see a lot of those guys at those shows are in Russia.
See,

2254
02:11:14.421 --> 02:11:18.620
I'm watching this cat and this is not like a freak knockout or something like

2255
02:11:18.621 --> 02:11:21.140
that.
This guy's got real smart,

2256
02:11:21.141 --> 02:11:25.280
technical striking and he's also puts tremendous pressure on and he's also got

2257
02:11:25.281 --> 02:11:30.200
big power and they're amateur combat sports.
Yeah.
That,
uh,
like,
you know,

2258
02:11:30.201 --> 02:11:35.030
combat sambo and things like that.
They get a lot of experience.
Yeah.
Well,

2259
02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:37.070
when you see a guy like Khabib number,

2260
02:11:37.071 --> 02:11:41.350
could Madoff just run through people in the UFC and you know where that guy's

2261
02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.720
from.
You got to go,
well how many more of those guys were over there,
you know?

2262
02:11:45.230 --> 02:11:48.110
Yeah.
The Dagestan crew then that's that beat too.

2263
02:11:48.111 --> 02:11:51.680
He's from Dagestan isn't Islam mocket Chavez need from that,

2264
02:11:51.740 --> 02:11:56.180
that part of the world as well.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's where a Keller's areas,
boom,

2265
02:11:56.210 --> 02:12:01.120
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.
That's it.
Yeah.
So I mean the caucus friends,

2266
02:12:01.121 --> 02:12:04.640
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
That's a warrior.
We your group

2267
02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:08.970

Yeah.
Yeah.
There's a lot of man,
so I get to go there.
A lot of them.</v>

2268
02:12:08.971 --> 02:12:11.740
I mean it's really exciting.
I get to see a lot of really cool stuff.

2269
02:12:11.800 --> 02:12:16.720
Dagestan like okay.
Dagestan was a blast.
Dagestan was fun,
man.
Yeah,

2270
02:12:16.730 --> 02:12:21.440
I went there.
Um,
I um,
uh,
you know,
it was there with a,
who was also at the show.

2271
02:12:21.441 --> 02:12:24.110
They brought over,
um,
we're doing and uh,

2272
02:12:24.500 --> 02:12:27.040
and those guys weren't working for doing it and Anderson Silva's,

2273
02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:30.130
those guys are watching fights you missed,
you know,
but I was working.
But yeah,

2274
02:12:30.150 --> 02:12:32.960
they took us around.
They showed us a lot of really cool stuff.

2275
02:12:33.230 --> 02:12:36.740
I went to like a school where some kids wrestling school,

2276
02:12:36.741 --> 02:12:41.320
cause like a lot of uh,
schools that were uh,
athletic.
Uh,

2277
02:12:41.330 --> 02:12:45.170
what an athletic orientation and seeing these little kids may put this little

2278
02:12:45.171 --> 02:12:49.220
kid up on a bar and had him doing pull ups.
Man,
he was doing pull ups.

2279
02:12:49.221 --> 02:12:51.040
I mean he's a little kid,
little bitty kid.

2280
02:12:51.110 --> 02:12:55.130
I mean it must have been at least 15 pull ups.
And then,
I mean,

2281
02:12:55.131 --> 02:12:59.240
he was a little kid,
like not as like something like nine or something like that.

2282
02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:02.330
If and when coach,
when the coach pulled him off,
he was mad.

2283
02:13:02.331 --> 02:13:04.070
You could see these meds.
Like,
man,
I got more,

2284
02:13:04.071 --> 02:13:06.260
you know what the meeting was mad like,
well there's so that people would,

2285
02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:10.790
I could do,
but um,
and the crowd,
they loved him in May so much.
They were like,

2286
02:13:10.791 --> 02:13:12.170
it was like,
you know what it was like,

2287
02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:15.740
it was like you were watched those videos of like,
um,
the Beatles.

2288
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:18.570
You know what I mean?
When all the people going crazy,
but it's not teenage girls.

2289
02:13:18.571 --> 02:13:22.880
It's like a bunch of Harlow wrestlers packs.
Like,
yeah,

2290
02:13:22.881 --> 02:13:26.390
I've got the pictures,
uh,
from somewhere.
Yeah.
I can sell them too.
Wow.

2291
02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:30.440
So it's that popular over there.
Yeah,
that's it.
Now,

2292
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:32.190
what did

2293
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:33.310
<v 1>you see the video of,</v>

2294
02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:37.740
of those dudes when Cubbie be Connor and they're shooting machine guns into the

2295
02:13:37.741 --> 02:13:39.110
air or,

2296
02:13:39.760 --> 02:13:41.470
<v 2>I didn't see that,
but I saw the,
uh,</v>

2297
02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:44.440
one of my friends from that area sent me some pictures that she was out on the

2298
02:13:44.441 --> 02:13:48.920
street.
She sent some pictures,
uh,
to,
uh,
to my wife of them.
Uh,

2299
02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:53.680
some video of guys,
uh,
like death she can get and horse racing had horses,

2300
02:13:53.681 --> 02:13:57.310
their horses down.
Yes.
Some video that was like,
oh,

2301
02:13:58.150 --> 02:14:01.500
shooting guns.
Like those,
yeah.
There are people where it was like a prayer.

2302
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:04.660
People who were so excited about that know that's some energy there.
Yeah.

2303
02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:09.580
Imagine you're from a place that many parts of the world never heard of until

2304
02:14:09.590 --> 02:14:10.050
now.

2305
02:14:10.050 --> 02:14:10.950
<v 1>I don't know.</v>

2306
02:14:11.070 --> 02:14:15.720
W W w how much I thought about Dagestan before it could be you came around and

2307
02:14:15.721 --> 02:14:19.290
then now they have the,
not just a world champion,

2308
02:14:19.470 --> 02:14:23.250
but the guy who smashed the most famous fighter on the planet.
Right.

2309
02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:25.110
One of the most famous fighters on the planet.

2310
02:14:25.290 --> 02:14:26.380
It's like him and Floyd Mayweather.

2311
02:14:26.381 --> 02:14:29.540
They're probably the two most famous fighters.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2312
02:14:29.610 --> 02:14:34.560
It could be just ran through them.
So like he's a,

2313
02:14:34.620 --> 02:14:36.990
he's a huge,
huge star over there.

2314
02:14:37.630 --> 02:14:42.440
<v 2>Yeah.
No,
no.
Yeah,
he's cute.
So the,
that uh,
yeah,</v>

2315
02:14:42.460 --> 02:14:44.890
no,
it's,
it's,
it's a fun place to go.
Matter of fact.
I,
yeah,

2316
02:14:45.250 --> 02:14:47.200
I've got to see a lot of cool stuff or your lists.

2317
02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:50.850
<v 1>Dagestan explosive delight after Khabib defeats Mcgregor,</v>

2318
02:14:52.230 --> 02:14:53.760
they're all going crazy with their hats on.

2319
02:14:56.060 --> 02:15:00.270
I get people out in the street cheering.
Yeah.
Wow.

2320
02:15:01.830 --> 02:15:04.410
Yeah man.
Connors,

2321
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:07.170
all the shit talk leading up to that fight,
man.

2322
02:15:07.171 --> 02:15:12.171
Did that backfire like some people at works and then some people it's just,

2323
02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:17.070
it doesn't work at all and it just makes him more relentless when Colby was

2324
02:15:17.071 --> 02:15:21.000
hitting them going,
let's talk now.
Come on,
let's talk now.
Now with him,
you know,

2325
02:15:21.001 --> 02:15:24.750
cause he talks the whole time right from the beginning of the eight he starts

2326
02:15:24.751 --> 02:15:27.660
talking to he does.
No,
yeah,
he starts talking.
Really?
What does he say?

2327
02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:32.360
W and then you hear it when he was fighting Johnson give up.
Give Up.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2328
02:15:32.361 --> 02:15:34.050
You know,
I need to tell it a shot.
Give Up.

2329
02:15:34.110 --> 02:15:37.950
Then he got him in that horrific Kamora I was watching that Kamora I was like,

2330
02:15:37.951 --> 02:15:41.870
don't you just fucking tap.
Come on man.
Tap.
Come on man.
Ah,

2331
02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:45.630
ah,
just feeling everything going.
Pop,
snap,
pop.

2332
02:15:47.870 --> 02:15:51.000
They didn't want to tap man Johnson.
A tough guy.

2333
02:15:51.770 --> 02:15:55.430
<v 2>Yeah.
But I,
I,
you know that,
uh,
the smack talk,
I mean,
that's what</v>

2334
02:15:55.470 --> 02:15:59.850
<v 1>Tyler does.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But this was a different level.
Let's talk.</v>

2335
02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:04.650
He said,
come on,
let's talk now.
Can we hear it?

2336
02:16:05.590 --> 02:16:06.660
He has Megan Johnson.

2337
02:16:13.870 --> 02:16:14.703
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2338
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:19.200
He sounds like he really cares about each other.

2339
02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:25.880
<v 1>You know this,
I deserve it.
I have to fight for the title.
You know this,</v>

2340
02:16:25.881 --> 02:16:28.880
I deserve it.
As he's beating him.
Right?
Yeah.

2341
02:16:29.770 --> 02:16:33.260
And he's talking to someone on the sideline.
I smash your boy,
Mike.

2342
02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:37.990
The scary thing that he ever said was a about Connor.
I want to change his face.

2343
02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:42.730
Like,
who want to change his face?
Like,
oh,

2344
02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:48.790
Jesus.
Yeah.
So I heard he's retired,
right?
Connor,

2345
02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:54.860
you don't buy it,
right?
I don't know.
Yeah.
If you had to guess.
Yeah.

2346
02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:57.370
He's fighting yet.
Han's Mollin camp,
you know,

2347
02:16:57.371 --> 02:17:01.740
Han's from monster pictures sparring with Connor today.
Awesome.

2348
02:17:03.060 --> 02:17:07.290
Connor's training.
Yeah,
no monsters.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2349
02:17:07.300 --> 02:17:11.020
It works from monster.
He's,
he's training.
He's gonna fight.

2350
02:17:11.050 --> 02:17:13.480
He's probably just fucking with people,
you know.
I mean,

2351
02:17:13.481 --> 02:17:15.940
Connor is a master showman.

2352
02:17:15.970 --> 02:17:20.140
In terms of like how to keep people interested in him.
And I just think he just,

2353
02:17:20.530 --> 02:17:23.830
he got way out of the line with all this Khabib stuff.
But I'd like to wait.

2354
02:17:23.831 --> 02:17:27.130
I would like to wait.
He takes his losses.
Oh,
he took it.
Well,
I liked the way,

2355
02:17:27.131 --> 02:17:29.330
I like the way he goes out there and talk smack,
whatever.

2356
02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:32.260
When I think I like as a,
I'm in a,

2357
02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:35.670
like from a sports psychology point of view,
I think he's a,

2358
02:17:35.700 --> 02:17:37.840
he think he's developed there,
you know?
Yeah.

2359
02:17:37.841 --> 02:17:40.870
But I don't think the way to get in another fight we could be is to continue to

2360
02:17:40.871 --> 02:17:44.890
talk shit after he smashes.
You mean he doesn't have any reason to,

2361
02:17:45.010 --> 02:17:48.100
you can just talk shit like he,
he didn't just win.

2362
02:17:48.490 --> 02:17:51.310
He smashed and tapped you like it was,

2363
02:17:51.311 --> 02:17:53.830
it was only like one or two moments in the fire.
We're,

2364
02:17:53.831 --> 02:17:57.910
Connor was taking control with some of the striking and the stand up,
you know,

2365
02:17:58.110 --> 02:18:00.940
and that's another choke.
That's another misunderstood choke.

2366
02:18:00.940 --> 02:18:05.280
That fulcrum choke there can be.
Got Connor went.
That is a legit net crank.
Yeah.

2367
02:18:05.281 --> 02:18:07.570
Yeah.
And people that don't think,
oh,
he tap to that.

2368
02:18:07.571 --> 02:18:10.810
Like you attach that to and if you didn't,
you're stupid.
And people were like,

2369
02:18:10.811 --> 02:18:13.640
yeah,
because the chin was down there right there.
Like you,

2370
02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:18.120
there's a lot when you're,
there's a lot of,
it generates a lot of forced yeah.

2371
02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:23.080
Unhinge your jaw and face apart.
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
That,
that's a legit,

2372
02:18:23.110 --> 02:18:27.650
that's a legit submission.
Yeah.
Especially with that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.

2373
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:32.570
Back the back of your forum against the guys back as leveraged,
you know,

2374
02:18:32.750 --> 02:18:37.630
which caused that fulcrum.
Yeah.
That's horrific.
Very powerful.
It hurts bad man.

2375
02:18:37.660 --> 02:18:39.880
There's a lot of those net crank,
so just like,
oh,

2376
02:18:39.881 --> 02:18:44.770
you watch people and you just go,
please tap.
Yeah.
There it is right there.

2377
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:49.950
Like you see with Khabib's left arm pressing against the back of Connor and then

2378
02:18:51.191 --> 02:18:54.880
also yanking on that and that is ripping his fucking neck apartment.
Yeah.

2379
02:18:54.881 --> 02:18:58.390
You never,
yeah.
You until you felt one.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2380
02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:04.930
Um,
but Connor,
it's interesting that the ways posted up like that.

2381
02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:09.260
Are you just trying to get up and he's getting cracked at the same time?
Yeah.

2382
02:19:09.430 --> 02:19:12.730
You got to kind of,
yeah,
he was already,

2383
02:19:13.240 --> 02:19:15.850
he had already been smashed by then too.
You know,

2384
02:19:15.851 --> 02:19:18.610
he'd been hitting with hit with so many big punches from the top.

2385
02:19:18.790 --> 02:19:21.630
He takes a great shot though,
I'll tell you that.
Yeah.

2386
02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:25.360
But it's just one of those things where I think in order for him to really have

2387
02:19:25.660 --> 02:19:28.370
a real chance at getting another shot,

2388
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:33.490
what he's got to do is beat somebody big and say something that makes Khabib

2389
02:19:35.070 --> 02:19:36.830
considerate,
you know?
But not in,

2390
02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:40.190
not in the way of what he's been doing in terms of,
you know,

2391
02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:43.490
talking shit about him and talking smack.
I mean,

2392
02:19:43.510 --> 02:19:46.220
I think the only way it's going to be public demand,

2393
02:19:46.221 --> 02:19:49.490
like he's gonna have to get to a position where people want to see him fight,

2394
02:19:49.660 --> 02:19:52.790
could be began to see that the result may be different this time.

2395
02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:56.940
And then maybe if he could just fucking communicate something to them.
So,

2396
02:19:56.941 --> 02:20:01.550
you know,
I respect you,
you know,
all trash.
Talk aside,
you know,

2397
02:20:01.551 --> 02:20:04.790
I'd like to test myself against you one more time and I think I earned it.

2398
02:20:04.820 --> 02:20:06.020
I think that's the only way he's going to get it.

2399
02:20:06.050 --> 02:20:08.930
I think if the only way it's going to get it is to,
to win a couple of fights,

2400
02:20:09.140 --> 02:20:12.970
beat some real big name guys and then make it so that's,
uh,

2401
02:20:13.010 --> 02:20:14.750
something that could be,
is actually interested in.

2402
02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:19.530
<v 2>Well,
okay.
So I don't know if that's the only way,
but it's the way that would be,</v>

2403
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:22.620
uh,
that I would like to see they already offered it to,
could be even keel.

2404
02:20:22.680 --> 02:20:25.440
It could be you've said fuck off.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2405
02:20:25.530 --> 02:20:28.530
But like that path that you're talking about sounds like a one,

2406
02:20:28.531 --> 02:20:31.320
that one that fits good for me.
Yeah.
I'd like to see it that way.

2407
02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:36.900
Do you think that trash talking in MMA has gone too far or do you want to get

2408
02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:41.130
high?
I mean,
well,
I think it's entertaining.
Yeah.
Uh,

2409
02:20:41.160 --> 02:20:45.630
for some people I think it's not,
well here it's hard.
Well,
because

2410
02:20:47.940 --> 02:20:52.170
it's not,
um,
it's not always what I want to see.

2411
02:20:52.890 --> 02:20:56.280
And it's not,
uh,
I don't know.
It's not the type of person I am,

2412
02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:58.090
but not everyone's going to be me.
That's not what,

2413
02:20:58.091 --> 02:21:00.900
that's what makes the world go round.
And it's a lot of people want to see it.

2414
02:21:01.170 --> 02:21:04.890
And also sometimes it does bring some energy and some you don't.

2415
02:21:04.891 --> 02:21:05.641
When it's well done,

2416
02:21:05.641 --> 02:21:09.360
it does bring some energy and some excitement to the fight and to the sport.

2417
02:21:09.361 --> 02:21:11.580
And at the same time,
not every fight.

2418
02:21:11.650 --> 02:21:15.360
What's in wedding was really interesting and was really excited about the UFC,

2419
02:21:15.630 --> 02:21:20.630
is that there's a lot of fights that people want to see that have no bearing on

2420
02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:22.890
the title.
Right.

2421
02:21:23.220 --> 02:21:26.160
And so there's something to that fights that just people want to see.

2422
02:21:26.170 --> 02:21:30.170
And I think trash talk sometimes makes fight that people want to see.
Yeah,

2423
02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:30.720
for sure.

2424
02:21:30.720 --> 02:21:33.480
<v 1>Yeah,
it makes sense.
Emotional,
it makes things intense.</v>

2425
02:21:33.690 --> 02:21:37.050
It's great for selling things.
It's great for selling paper views.

2426
02:21:37.051 --> 02:21:38.360
But the question is like,

2427
02:21:38.470 --> 02:21:41.890
<v 2>is it good for the sport overall and should it be something that we encourage?</v>

2428
02:21:41.930 --> 02:21:43.300
Well,
how was that for,

2429
02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:46.570
and that's the thing is how do we decide what's good for the sport?

2430
02:21:46.770 --> 02:21:50.240
Or in what way?
Right.
How do we decide?
Is it good for the way the sport,
uh,

2431
02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:54.220
do want the sport to look at as far as martial arts and be in a respectful thing

2432
02:21:54.221 --> 02:21:57.010
and people looking at us like that,
maybe not.

2433
02:21:57.670 --> 02:22:00.940
Is it good for the sport or the growth of the sport and for more opportunities

2434
02:22:00.941 --> 02:22:05.680
for athletes and for our athletes to become,
uh,
uh,
names that,

2435
02:22:05.681 --> 02:22:09.700
uh,
that draw attention from other people that normally didn't know about it.

2436
02:22:10.270 --> 02:22:14.410
I Dunno.
I Dunno either,
but yeah,
so,
so I don't know.
I,

2437
02:22:14.740 --> 02:22:17.050
I'm torn.
I like both.

2438
02:22:17.290 --> 02:22:21.370
I like exactly what it Machita type character that's very respectful bowels and

2439
02:22:21.371 --> 02:22:26.310
never talks trash and fights like a,
you know,
just a world caliber martial

2440
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:31.200
<v 1>artist.
And I also liked that guy talks mad shit.
Think it's funny.
Yeah.</v>

2441
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:33.740
Yeah,
exactly.
I enjoy it.
It's like,

2442
02:22:34.350 --> 02:22:37.220
I like press conferences for that very reason where,
you know,

2443
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:40.890
guys are talking shit to each other and they're looking over at each other on

2444
02:22:40.891 --> 02:22:44.160
the podium.
You know,
it's funny.
Oh,
come on.
If some of them,
yeah,

2445
02:22:44.161 --> 02:22:46.470
some of it is hilarious.
Yeah.
How about Connor?

2446
02:22:46.471 --> 02:22:50.540
When Jeremy Stevens slit him for Pfizer.
Who the fuck is that guy?
No,

2447
02:22:50.640 --> 02:22:54.060
it was effective.
We look,
what do you get to?
When he got up,
he was like,
okay,

2448
02:22:54.061 --> 02:22:56.280
I don't have time to insult everyone,
so let's,
yeah,

2449
02:22:56.370 --> 02:23:01.000
let's get them all in one place.
Right.
That was great.
Like so it everyone,

2450
02:23:01.030 --> 02:23:03.930
would this be efficient?
Come on.
There's comedy,

2451
02:23:03.950 --> 02:23:06.840
but what he was talking about where it's red panties night.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2452
02:23:06.841 --> 02:23:09.990
That was made it baby.
We got caught up with Greg or play.

2453
02:23:12.990 --> 02:23:14.600
He's a fucking character.
My uncle.

2454
02:23:14.880 --> 02:23:19.050
Mine isn't that weird situation though where he really never has to fight again.

2455
02:23:19.051 --> 02:23:21.830
So you've got to wonder what his motivation is.
You know,

2456
02:23:22.060 --> 02:23:24.930
like he has $100 million.

2457
02:23:25.380 --> 02:23:29.370
He has a gigantic whiskey company that proper 12 is murdering it.

2458
02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:33.140
That that place is killing it.
That that company is,
they're,

2459
02:23:33.150 --> 02:23:35.850
they're moving into other countries now.
I mean they're killing it.

2460
02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:40.230
He doesn't have to do a thing ever financially.
Right.

2461
02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:42.060
Unless he wants to eat diamond sandwiches.

2462
02:23:42.090 --> 02:23:45.390
He's basically could do whatever the fuck he wants for the rest of his life and

2463
02:23:45.391 --> 02:23:50.370
just live off interest.
But he still likes to fight.
Yeah,
I think so.
Yeah.

2464
02:23:50.371 --> 02:23:52.310
I mean that's what brought him into the QB.
He fight.

2465
02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:56.730
He didn't have to fight Khabib,
but just,
you know,
how much does he want it?

2466
02:23:56.940 --> 02:24:00.090
I mean does he want it the same way a guy like style bender wants it or guy like

2467
02:24:00.091 --> 02:24:04.920
Calvin Calvin Gaslin wants it and also I think that part of one unit is

2468
02:24:04.921 --> 02:24:09.921
different to maybe maybe there's maybe people might want things on their terms

2469
02:24:10.291 --> 02:24:12.360
too,
uncertain terms of way you could get in his way.

2470
02:24:12.390 --> 02:24:14.910
Like it's like some people were like,
oh,
you'll want it.

2471
02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:18.060
I'm wondering any way I can get it.
Some people might want it and say,

2472
02:24:18.061 --> 02:24:20.880
well now I want it this way.
Well he was going to fight cowboy.

2473
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:23.700
That was a fight that they were,
they were basically trying to make,

2474
02:24:23.701 --> 02:24:27.480
but it was going to have to be a co main event.
And because of that,

2475
02:24:27.481 --> 02:24:31.080
I think Connor was not interested in anymore.
He wanted it to be a main event,

2476
02:24:31.290 --> 02:24:32.910
you know,
and I'm like Jesus,

2477
02:24:33.930 --> 02:24:36.630
like is that really what kept us from controversy is cowboy.

2478
02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:40.800
Can you guys a hundred versus cowboy make that a fucking main event.

2479
02:24:40.801 --> 02:24:45.801
Like make some malarkey title come up with some hundred 60 pound title or some

2480
02:24:46.111 --> 02:24:48.000
shit.
Just come on man.
I do it.

2481
02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:53.250
I mean they give out these interim titles left and right.

2482
02:24:53.251 --> 02:24:55.800
How about you come up with some alarm excited when that was going to happen?

2483
02:24:55.801 --> 02:24:58.120
Yeah.
Yeah.
I was excited to see it.

2484
02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:01.500
165 pound malarkey title just come off man.

2485
02:25:01.950 --> 02:25:04.920
Conor versus cowboy for the title.

2486
02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:09.540
Make a title up but that does make it,
yeah,
I agree.

2487
02:25:09.570 --> 02:25:11.130
I don't think it would hurt at all,

2488
02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:13.950
but apparently Dana says it makes a big difference in the amount of paper views.

2489
02:25:14.310 --> 02:25:17.610
Yeah.
Yeah.
But now that they've already ESPN plus,
is it really going to be,

2490
02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:19.570
I mean how does that work now you you,

2491
02:25:19.571 --> 02:25:23.480
you pay every month and then you pay a little more for the paper views.

2492
02:25:23.481 --> 02:25:27.470
Is that what it is?
Is how it works?
How much more is it?
It's like fights,

2493
02:25:27.490 --> 02:25:32.370
just like $5 last,
remember,
whatever it is that you're paying
your monthly.

2494
02:25:32.960 --> 02:25:35.320
Yeah.
Wow.
That's a good deal.

2495
02:25:35.321 --> 02:25:38.410
If you're into watching all those fights on ESPN plus it is nice.

2496
02:25:38.411 --> 02:25:41.410
They do have a great library,
but so does fight pass,
right?

2497
02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:43.320
Where does that put five pounds at five past?

2498
02:25:43.330 --> 02:25:47.650
I can't see some of the stuff that's on bypass.
There's this other,
oh yeah,
yeah.

2499
02:25:48.010 --> 02:25:52.720
Way More.
There's of this door boy tie organisations and yeah,

2500
02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:54.460
five passes.
Awesome.
For the gym.

2501
02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:58.810
I have a little home gym with the apple TV on it and I always have fipass on

2502
02:25:58.840 --> 02:25:59.770
kickboxing.

2503
02:25:59.950 --> 02:26:04.420
You watch obscure Moy Thai fights like right from the arena and Thailand,

2504
02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:06.220
you know,
it's,
it's really cool.

2505
02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:08.860
Like a hundred pound guys beating the shit out of each other and submission

2506
02:26:08.861 --> 02:26:11.530
wrestling too.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
A lot of Abu Dhabi stuff is on there.

2507
02:26:11.531 --> 02:26:14.290
All Eddie Bravo stuff is on there.
All the Eddie Bravo,

2508
02:26:14.291 --> 02:26:18.040
invitational combat Jujitsu's on there.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2509
02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:20.710
Jujitsu's in a great place right now too,
right?
I mean it's,

2510
02:26:20.711 --> 02:26:24.730
there's so many different martial arts that are really at the pinnacle right
now.

2511
02:26:24.731 --> 02:26:24.941
I mean,

2512
02:26:24.941 --> 02:26:29.941
I think this is such an amazing time for a person yet so many people martial

2513
02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:34.910
arts and yeah.
Is A,
this is a great time for martial arts.
Well,

2514
02:26:34.911 --> 02:26:38.110
you remember when you and I first got into it,
there was,

2515
02:26:38.830 --> 02:26:41.860
I mean there was nothing,
nothing what it is now.
Nothing.

2516
02:26:42.010 --> 02:26:45.820
Marshall has been around for thousands and thousands of years and the level of

2517
02:26:45.821 --> 02:26:48.580
martial arts since 1993 to today is,

2518
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:52.690
it's indescribably more powerful today.
Like the,

2519
02:26:52.710 --> 02:26:56.170
the athletes are so much better.
The fighters are so much more well rounded.

2520
02:26:56.410 --> 02:26:57.580
Even in Jujitsu,

2521
02:26:57.970 --> 02:27:02.320
if you go back to and watch old Jitsu matches from like 93 and of course you're

2522
02:27:02.321 --> 02:27:03.910
going to have like your Hixon Gracie's,

2523
02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:07.420
he can Machado's and John Chalk Machado's who are at that elite level,

2524
02:27:07.421 --> 02:27:09.310
even back then where they can hang with guys today.

2525
02:27:09.610 --> 02:27:14.610
But overall the game is like Saul complaint and also even just the athleticism.

2526
02:27:15.551 --> 02:27:20.200
You've seen it.
Okay.
Yeah.
I mean these dues are some animals.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,

2527
02:27:20.201 --> 02:27:22.610
it's incredible.
And I mean,

2528
02:27:22.730 --> 02:27:26.650
and really what's interesting to me is that you're really only seeing a small

2529
02:27:26.651 --> 02:27:31.360
percentage of the elite athletes that are available in North America that even

2530
02:27:31.361 --> 02:27:32.820
decide to get into it,
right.

2531
02:27:33.640 --> 02:27:38.170
If you talk about how many elite athletes decide to go into baseball or NFL or

2532
02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:41.890
NBA versus how many elite athletes go in the cage fighting,

2533
02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:45.300
it's not even close.
Right.
Right,
right.

2534
02:27:45.310 --> 02:27:47.740
But it's starting to get some of them slowly,
a little bit,

2535
02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:50.470
and some of them are starting to get an inch and in Jujitsu is a reason why some

2536
02:27:50.471 --> 02:27:53.830
of them are getting an interest in Jujitsu.
They train,
right?
Like,
yeah.

2537
02:27:53.831 --> 02:27:57.340
For Cross training and doing it for something which people want to learn it,

2538
02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:59.800
you know,
I mean,
if you're a big guy,
but just know how to fight,

2539
02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:03.640
that's gotta suck big old giant guy.
It doesn't actually know how to fight like,

2540
02:28:03.641 --> 02:28:08.170
fuck man,
but it learned some of this shit.
Right?
Yeah.
Um,

2541
02:28:08.410 --> 02:28:11.500
it's just for,
for those big athletes,

2542
02:28:11.501 --> 02:28:15.340
the really big pay days or at NFL and that's the other thing too,

2543
02:28:15.341 --> 02:28:18.910
is that a lot of those guys are bigger than 265 pounds.
Exactly.

2544
02:28:18.970 --> 02:28:22.040
Like they would have to cut a lot of weight to make two 65,
which is isn't

2545
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.860
<v 0>that weird that we have a heavyweight division that you have to weigh in for?</v>

2546
02:28:24.920 --> 02:28:29.840
Yeah,
no,
I think that is interesting,
but
I wonder what,

2547
02:28:29.841 --> 02:28:32.180
uh,
the super heavyweight division would look like.

2548
02:28:33.470 --> 02:28:37.070
It would probably be just a small handful of giant guys.

2549
02:28:37.071 --> 02:28:40.070
It would probably be like the flyweights right.
In terms of like how fee,

2550
02:28:40.071 --> 02:28:43.490
unless Iceland,
they get those Iceland's strong men dudes.

2551
02:28:43.491 --> 02:28:46.910
They start fighting MMA.
Have you seen,
oh,
what's his name?

2552
02:28:46.911 --> 02:28:50.340
The Polish a [inaudible] Yap.
Puts.
He fights a lot now.

2553
02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:52.840
I like him and you know what,
I've man,
you know,

2554
02:28:52.841 --> 02:28:56.660
when people were all were kind of,
you know,
giving him a hard time about it.

2555
02:28:56.661 --> 02:29:00.380
But man,
Pooja,
I have a lot of respect for him.
Man Fights hard.

2556
02:29:00.381 --> 02:29:04.600
He brought a lot of,
put a lot of eyes on our sport who denounced the,
I'm a,

2557
02:29:04.601 --> 02:29:08.570
I'm a fan.
He's still thinks he's gotten way better.
He's gotten better.

2558
02:29:08.571 --> 02:29:11.230
And he never liked any chumps no.

2559
02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:15.800
And he brings it in and there he is.
Look at him.
Look at the size of that.

2560
02:29:15.801 --> 02:29:20.000
Motherfucker's still even can look it.
He looks skillful now.
He'd like,

2561
02:29:20.001 --> 02:29:22.850
he's moving much better.
And here's the thing,

2562
02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:26.870
this phase guys can better got balls of steel.
He fought me.

2563
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:31.130
Tim Silvia,
my referee.
Tapulous yeah,
I was like,

2564
02:29:31.131 --> 02:29:35.840
I could not believe that that's where they put him up against for a who is early

2565
02:29:35.841 --> 02:29:38.450
in his career.
Like that's what I'm saying.
Fuck the risk.

2566
02:29:38.451 --> 02:29:41.630
But that's what I'm like,
I'm respect like were there,
I was like,
I respect you.

2567
02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:44.180
You chose him.
Yeah.
It was ridiculous.

2568
02:29:44.181 --> 02:29:47.750
And he trows chose him very early in his career.
Rarely.

2569
02:29:48.070 --> 02:29:50.330
He really didn't have the skills that he has now.

2570
02:29:50.510 --> 02:29:55.130
And Tim is a world champion and the end,

2571
02:29:55.131 --> 02:29:58.580
the end,
the type of body that's very hard for punching Nazis.
Oh yeah.

2572
02:29:58.581 --> 02:30:01.430
Long and tall.
Long them to wrestler.

2573
02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:06.440
Who can put his hands on your hips and control your levers and really make you,

2574
02:30:06.510 --> 02:30:08.630
you know,
your muscles get fatigued.

2575
02:30:08.631 --> 02:30:11.150
You make you gas out starting from the beginning.

2576
02:30:11.151 --> 02:30:12.950
So you could see what it was like early for them getting me,

2577
02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:15.530
Tim just start beating the shit out of him once he got tired.

2578
02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:19.990
But it's interesting because Tim has the opposite of puts,
now's his body,
right?

2579
02:30:20.110 --> 02:30:23.210
Like he doesn't have the best genetics,
just tough.

2580
02:30:23.270 --> 02:30:26.270
And people will think that that,
that Pooja set up is going to be,

2581
02:30:26.271 --> 02:30:30.620
but actually for,
it's a very hard to fight somebody like Tim.
No,

2582
02:30:30.680 --> 02:30:35.340
very hard.
Very hard.
But he's also got massive experience with on,

2583
02:30:35.810 --> 02:30:38.480
I mean he's fought literally everybody,
any good all over the world.

2584
02:30:38.590 --> 02:30:42.080
Any offshore and yeah,
I mean he fought,
he fought the greats.

2585
02:30:42.080 --> 02:30:46.130
He fought Andre Arlovski win our loss.
He was straight up murderer in our last,

2586
02:30:46.140 --> 02:30:49.100
he was in his prime.
Randy coture.

2587
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:52.220
You know when Frank Mir broke his arm and he tried to keep fighting,

2588
02:30:52.270 --> 02:30:55.960
that's you too,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.

2589
02:30:56.020 --> 02:30:59.210
Cause I remember the crowd was booing like,
Ooh,
I was like,
guys,

2590
02:30:59.510 --> 02:31:02.500
you need to look at this.
Yeah,
no,
that's a,
that's a,
that's,
let me,

2591
02:31:02.510 --> 02:31:05.720
I will tell you about that because that was a fun story.
Cause like they,
um,

2592
02:31:06.740 --> 02:31:07.573
I hadn't really,

2593
02:31:07.610 --> 02:31:10.670
there's one of the first times I think they had trusted me with a championship

2594
02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:16.000
and uh,
he,
you know,
the arm broke.
I heard it,
I saw it.
And uh,

2595
02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:17.900
I remember,
you know,
I learned a lot.

2596
02:31:17.930 --> 02:31:20.370
I learned a lot about my job right then because I,

2597
02:31:20.371 --> 02:31:24.090
what I did is I backed off and I let the doctor come in and examine them.

2598
02:31:24.090 --> 02:31:26.760
Cause like,
you know,
sometimes when you're dealing with an expert,

2599
02:31:26.970 --> 02:31:29.670
you don't want to cloud the way you're supposed to get out of the way.
Right?

2600
02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:32.010
Like you don't go to the mechanic and tell them what to do.
So I had,

2601
02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:34.050
my mind was thinking like that about the doctor.

2602
02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:37.560
And so of course he comes in and she doesn't know what she's,
what she saw.

2603
02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:40.350
So he misguides guides her and says,
I think he's worried about this.

2604
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:44.370
And then she's like,
hey,
no,
nothing's wrong.
And I was like,
oh man.

2605
02:31:44.670 --> 02:31:47.190
In my mind I was thinking is it was,
it's been great being here,

2606
02:31:47.191 --> 02:31:50.970
but I'm not going to be doing this anymore.
You know what I mean?
And then

2607
02:31:53.010 --> 02:31:55.980
he agreed that switch already and I swear I was like,

2608
02:31:55.981 --> 02:31:58.990
in my mind I was thinking that I was thinking about how to get out of there and

2609
02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.530
when they start throwing stuff,
oh,

2610
02:32:00.780 --> 02:32:03.150
the military camp and maybe you remember they were over there wrestling with the

2611
02:32:03.151 --> 02:32:06.990
Samoan security guard is trying to get in there and keep people going and people

2612
02:32:06.991 --> 02:32:10.690
are screaming,
yeah,
here it is.
That's his other,

2613
02:32:11.670 --> 02:32:15.880
his other break.
It was an awful one.
Yeah.
So that,
I was thinking about that.

2614
02:32:15.881 --> 02:32:19.440
And then uh,
you know,
but then you found it,
you saved me.

2615
02:32:19.920 --> 02:32:23.430
I was thinking that my retribution was going to be like some kid on the Internet

2616
02:32:23.431 --> 02:32:27.090
two weeks later.
Like I found out his arm was broken,
but you found the spot.

2617
02:32:27.091 --> 02:32:29.790
And so then that was watching the replay and I was like,

2618
02:32:29.791 --> 02:32:33.750
let's take a look at this.
Hold on.
Hold on.
What's that on his arm.
I'm like,

2619
02:32:33.751 --> 02:32:37.260
that's a broken arm that Barb is broken.
Look at that.
Watch it one more time.

2620
02:32:37.350 --> 02:32:40.930
Oh and I had the truck roll about and then it went into the octagon and I

2621
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:44.460
remember saying immediately like,
you guys need to watch this.
Like here we go.

2622
02:32:44.461 --> 02:32:47.280
Let's play this.
Here we go.
That's a broken arm.

2623
02:32:47.340 --> 02:32:48.840
So I'm going to thank you for that right there.

2624
02:32:48.841 --> 02:32:50.730
Cause I don't have a career path would've been different.

2625
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:56.520
It was one of those things where I felt an obligation to not just interview the

2626
02:32:56.521 --> 02:33:00.970
fighter but to explain to the entire crowd like you gotta listen,
this is a,

2627
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:04.320
I know it looked crazy.
Look crazy to me too.
This is a broken arm.

2628
02:33:04.350 --> 02:33:07.290
Like this guy's fucked right now.
Three places.
And Tim,

2629
02:33:07.291 --> 02:33:10.740
thank you afterwards for saving his career because he said if you didn't stop

2630
02:33:10.741 --> 02:33:13.320
that fight and that became a compound fracture.
Fuck man.

2631
02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:17.850
Horrible things happen when the bone breaks through the skin.
Yeah,
it happened.

2632
02:33:18.090 --> 02:33:21.330
I saw him afterwards and I said,
men,
did you know your arm was broken?

2633
02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:24.900
And he told me,
he goes,
yeah,
I know what was in,
what was your plan?

2634
02:33:24.901 --> 02:33:27.690
Where are you trying to continue?
So I knew I had a minute before.

2635
02:33:27.691 --> 02:33:32.520
The pain really becomes crippling here is and watch this part.
Right.

2636
02:33:32.580 --> 02:33:33.960
Snap right there.

2637
02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:38.790
I mean that is 100% a double double break.
Yeah.

2638
02:33:38.820 --> 02:33:43.140
Both parts of the both bones of the forum snapped in half and it's an unusual

2639
02:33:43.141 --> 02:33:45.130
break because of where it is.
Yeah.

2640
02:33:45.140 --> 02:33:49.920
It just shows you how fucking strong frank mirs armbars and how long the empty

2641
02:33:49.921 --> 02:33:52.770
is.
It was also weird as hell.
His arm went back into place.

2642
02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:54.990
How young and muscular I talked to the doctor.

2643
02:33:54.991 --> 02:33:59.920
They say that happens sometimes with athletes.
The muscles just put it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2644
02:34:00.330 --> 02:34:04.470
Well he had a plate put in there forever.
It's still in there.
Look at me.
Young,

2645
02:34:04.680 --> 02:34:08.790
fresh face.
Joe Rogan and that was kind of young.
Frank looks,

2646
02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:13.560
that's crazy.
He looks so lean and young and he's a big old giant dude now.

2647
02:34:14.850 --> 02:34:19.060
He was a fantastic commentator.
Yeah,
no,
he's a really good comment.

2648
02:34:19.090 --> 02:34:20.080
Really good commentator.

2649
02:34:20.140 --> 02:34:24.010
I'm amazed that no one's snatched him up to do commentary.
You know it's funny,

2650
02:34:24.011 --> 02:34:27.730
he was working for Aca.
Yeah,
he just stopped though.
He was,
he was there.

2651
02:34:27.731 --> 02:34:30.970
He was there for a while in his commentary.
What's weird is he always,

2652
02:34:31.210 --> 02:34:33.610
he's as a commentary when I like listening to him,

2653
02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:35.560
his commentary and also just talking to him,

2654
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:40.300
he always comes up at an angle that I never think of and it makes sense.

2655
02:34:40.301 --> 02:34:41.530
It's worth here and you're like,
oh.
He's like,

2656
02:34:41.531 --> 02:34:45.190
what's frank going to say about this?
Sometimes.
Yeah,
he gets some rear dangles.

2657
02:34:45.430 --> 02:34:50.380
Very smart dude.
Very well read dude.
Really misunderstood guy and a lot of ways.

2658
02:34:50.381 --> 02:34:52.480
But Frank was,

2659
02:34:52.660 --> 02:34:56.020
I think it was one of the Lesnar fight when he fought Lesnar either before the

2660
02:34:56.021 --> 02:34:59.560
first fight or the second fight,
I forget which fight it was.

2661
02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:03.730
He said he wanted lesson to be the first death inside the inside of the cage and

2662
02:35:03.731 --> 02:35:06.310
the UFC.
I was like,
what the fuck are you saying?

2663
02:35:06.750 --> 02:35:09.580
And then they pulled him out of the commentary for saying that and he's like,

2664
02:35:09.581 --> 02:35:12.310
look,
I'm just talking up a fight.
And that was it.

2665
02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:15.730
He was doing w e c at that point,
remember?
Right,
right,
right,
right.
Yeah.
Did.

2666
02:35:15.731 --> 02:35:19.480
He was really good,
man.
I remember listening to his commentary.
I'm like this guy,

2667
02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:23.680
he's,
I,
I'm a big fan of former fighters doing it.

2668
02:35:23.710 --> 02:35:26.860
I think they do the best commentary.
He does great comedy a lot.
Yeah.

2669
02:35:26.890 --> 02:35:30.610
Daniel [inaudible].
Daniel Cormier is fantastic.
It's really good.
Dominic,

2670
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:35.320
you know who else I like?
Um,
I like Dan Hardee,
Dan Hardee's excellent.
Very,
very.

2671
02:35:35.370 --> 02:35:37.360
He's actually kind of morphed into,

2672
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:42.750
I mean he really is as solid as anyone as in including myself is like is doing

2673
02:35:43.121 --> 02:35:44.320
like professional commentary.

2674
02:35:44.320 --> 02:35:46.870
It's as good as anybody when we're talking about that too.
Oh,

2675
02:35:46.871 --> 02:35:49.330
Felder's good Tom mechanics that won that fight.

2676
02:35:49.600 --> 02:35:53.290
That's where I learned definitely that when the doctor with the dealer that they

2677
02:35:53.291 --> 02:35:56.080
don't know what we all take for granted,
that it's the arm.

2678
02:35:56.081 --> 02:36:00.100
So that was kind of my fall further up.
Now I definitely always tell them,
look,

2679
02:36:00.101 --> 02:36:02.680
this is actually what happened.
This is what I'm worried about.

2680
02:36:02.681 --> 02:36:06.460
This particular part,
you know?
Oh yeah,
that's gotta be huge for you because like,

2681
02:36:06.730 --> 02:36:10.030
if a woman gets into the octagon or a man and they,

2682
02:36:10.060 --> 02:36:11.950
they don't know anything about the sport,

2683
02:36:12.130 --> 02:36:14.020
they're just there because they're a doctor.
Right.

2684
02:36:14.070 --> 02:36:16.660
That would have no idea what the fuck.
And I didn't,
I didn't even,
I know,

2685
02:36:16.661 --> 02:36:19.180
it seems like that should be the first thing I thought about,
but yeah,

2686
02:36:19.270 --> 02:36:22.700
I did a long ass time ago,
Bro.
Yeah.

2687
02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:28.090
How many fights do you think you've called out of thousands,
man.
Thousands.

2688
02:36:28.260 --> 02:36:30.490
He has a lot.
Dan Townsend.
I'm not crazy.

2689
02:36:30.900 --> 02:36:34.630
If you really stop and think about all of that experience,
do you,
um,

2690
02:36:34.720 --> 02:36:38.890
do you do seminars for young up and coming rapper?
Do I just did it this weekend?

2691
02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:43.180
Yeah,
we're at in Pasadena.
Oh.
So,
uh,
you know,
you can go on my web site,

2692
02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:47.650
[inaudible] dot com also,
you can follow me at herb dean MMA on Instagram.

2693
02:36:47.850 --> 02:36:52.090
I'll usually do stuff.
I'm on Instagram page when they're posted the picture.

2694
02:36:52.091 --> 02:36:54.010
You with the blowtorch.
How?
Okay.
All right,
cool.

2695
02:36:54.490 --> 02:36:56.890
I'm worried to see this explosion of followers,
right?

2696
02:36:56.891 --> 02:37:00.930
It's coming baby and covers coming blows you.
Yeah,
no,
I,
so I do it.
Uh,
it's,

2697
02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:03.700
it's a fight.
I just did it.
It's a,

2698
02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:07.210
it's a cool thing because I like doing it because it makes me better every time.

2699
02:37:07.211 --> 02:37:10.460
It makes me have to think about things as I look at,
uh,
that.

2700
02:37:10.540 --> 02:37:14.770
So we spent three days doing it.
So think about teaching anything,
right?
Yeah.

2701
02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:16.070
Yeah.
It makes me,

2702
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:19.640
<v 2>uh,
makes me a lot better and I always dread it when I'm,</v>

2703
02:37:19.880 --> 02:37:24.650
when I'm going to do it because sometimes it just add a dread doing it and then

2704
02:37:24.890 --> 02:37:26.330
I haven't finished the holdup part.

2705
02:37:26.331 --> 02:37:29.470
The other part I don't like is I have to say no because I have,

2706
02:37:29.471 --> 02:37:32.520
it's for certificate and the certificate,
uh,

2707
02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:36.710
is what you need a certificate to get licensed.
And so,
um,

2708
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:41.050
some people aren't going to achieve the certificate so they can come in,

2709
02:37:41.051 --> 02:37:44.210
you know,
take the seminar,
but there is screening,
right?
Yeah.

2710
02:37:44.211 --> 02:37:48.740
So the first day they,
uh,
they,
we,
uh,
we go over a bunch of stuff,

2711
02:37:48.780 --> 02:37:51.440
then they teach me some technique and you know what I mean?

2712
02:37:51.441 --> 02:37:54.620
And so we can understand that they understand what's going on in there.

2713
02:37:54.920 --> 02:37:59.210
And so as far as for judging how to evaluate what these guys are actually doing,

2714
02:37:59.660 --> 02:38:03.210
and then that's where I say they teach you technique.
Like they'll see you,

2715
02:38:03.250 --> 02:38:06.810
you'll say to them,
hey,
show me how to set up a song.
Go like I go to the,
so we,

2716
02:38:06.970 --> 02:38:10.460
we do it in,
um,
we did it in Pasadena.
So I do it at,
at the,

2717
02:38:10.461 --> 02:38:13.010
at the courtyard Marriott right there.
We've got a classroom.

2718
02:38:13.220 --> 02:38:16.760
Then I can walk two blocks down and take one block to the right and be a

2719
02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:20.540
Savannah,
a savant in Young's a fight academy.
Go right there.

2720
02:38:20.690 --> 02:38:24.440
Step straight onto the math.
We do a warm up where we get to see a lot of stuff.

2721
02:38:24.441 --> 02:38:27.470
Okay.
Yeah.
Show me arm drag.
So many of this,
we get a lot of information right?

2722
02:38:27.471 --> 02:38:30.280
Then we can have a few notes.
All right.
Yeah,
show me a pass.
I mean,
that's,

2723
02:38:30.281 --> 02:38:32.930
I mean that and then I have them.
Yeah,
teach me a triangle.

2724
02:38:33.350 --> 02:38:37.400
Teach me by the numbers.
Teach me,
you know,
as it was taught to you or like,

2725
02:38:37.401 --> 02:38:38.930
and I don't care if he learned it on the Internet,

2726
02:38:38.931 --> 02:38:41.000
but why do you like it and would maybe,

2727
02:38:41.001 --> 02:38:43.940
what do you do different to make it work for you?
And just talk me through it.

2728
02:38:43.941 --> 02:38:45.410
Give me as much information as I can.

2729
02:38:45.980 --> 02:38:49.190
One guy this weekend took my course and he gave me so much.
If I,
man,

2730
02:38:49.191 --> 02:38:51.290
I couldn't wait every time it was gone.
It was really good.

2731
02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:55.430
He was a really detailed instructor,
but he was really good.
Then the,

2732
02:38:55.640 --> 02:38:56.241
but I learned a lot.

2733
02:38:56.241 --> 02:38:59.350
I've got a lot information from some of the other people who I thought was going

2734
02:38:59.351 --> 02:39:01.670
to be good because in the beginning we tell why we're here.

2735
02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:06.200
It sounded like I had a high level class.
A lot of them weren't.
Um,

2736
02:39:06.290 --> 02:39:08.420
they didn't know much about,
uh,

2737
02:39:08.510 --> 02:39:10.700
they didn't know enough about position and submission.

2738
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:15.680
How many guys do you think want to be referees but have no experience in martial

2739
02:39:15.681 --> 02:39:19.730
arts?
Well,
I think there is a lot.
I think it's common,
you know,

2740
02:39:19.731 --> 02:39:22.100
I'm on my website.
It lets people know like,
Hey,

2741
02:39:22.101 --> 02:39:25.950
a physical demonstration of a MMA technique is,

2742
02:39:25.970 --> 02:39:29.480
is required to achieve certification.
You can come out and you know,

2743
02:39:29.481 --> 02:39:33.350
take the seminar if that's fun for you,
which is cool.
My hat's off to you.

2744
02:39:33.351 --> 02:39:35.510
You know,
because of the lessons a lot,
you can do it your weekend,

2745
02:39:35.511 --> 02:39:36.800
but if you want the certificate,

2746
02:39:37.220 --> 02:39:41.890
you need to understand the techniques at a level that you know,
the teach.
Yeah.

2747
02:39:42.080 --> 02:39:45.080
At a detailed level and up because you'd have to not understand the details to

2748
02:39:45.081 --> 02:39:47.360
make it successful.
And that's why you have to,

2749
02:39:47.361 --> 02:39:49.850
if you're going to evaluate it as a judge,
you know,

2750
02:39:49.851 --> 02:39:52.220
you have to know why it wasn't successful and you're going to have to be able to

2751
02:39:52.221 --> 02:39:55.220
talk it through why you gave credit to something or didn't give credit to

2752
02:39:55.221 --> 02:39:58.370
something.
So this is for judging and referee judging and referee.

2753
02:39:58.490 --> 02:40:03.410
So the first day I do a,
as the judging and then the judges,
the referees,
uh,

2754
02:40:03.411 --> 02:40:07.010
for my,
the way I do my certificate,
if you want to be a referee,

2755
02:40:07.011 --> 02:40:10.460
you have to be able to judge also because everyone assumes that you can and

2756
02:40:10.461 --> 02:40:13.950
they'll throw you in the judge's seat.
So all in terms of training,
Oh,

2757
02:40:13.951 --> 02:40:16.650
if you like to do a small show or something like that,
we'll try and do that.

2758
02:40:16.710 --> 02:40:18.690
Yeah.
Yeah.
A small show.

2759
02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:22.650
We used to have this thing where Eddie Bravo used to a score.

2760
02:40:22.651 --> 02:40:27.270
The fights in between rounds.
It was excellent.
And what was good about it is,
um,

2761
02:40:27.540 --> 02:40:29.640
Eddie would break it down on a piece of paper.

2762
02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:32.820
He would have like a right calm and a left calm like right column would be you

2763
02:40:32.821 --> 02:40:36.870
left column B Jamie and then he would write,
okay.
Terp took him down three times.

2764
02:40:36.990 --> 02:40:41.160
Herb almost got a,
an Armbar herb landed five lave kicks.

2765
02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:44.970
Jamie cried a lot.
That's what it would say.
No,
you know what I'm saying?

2766
02:40:45.150 --> 02:40:47.400
It would say,
and then he would add it up and he would say,

2767
02:40:47.401 --> 02:40:51.210
this is why I think he won the round.
This guy had better position,

2768
02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:53.760
but this guy landed the big shots.
This guy got hurt,

2769
02:40:53.761 --> 02:40:57.390
but he almost got caught in a submission.
So I gave it real close,

2770
02:40:57.391 --> 02:40:58.620
but I gave it 10,
nine to this guy.

2771
02:40:59.030 --> 02:41:02.400
So you'd get a better understanding like how Howard Letterman used to do.

2772
02:41:02.440 --> 02:41:05.320
Harold Letterman used to do it further by saying like,

2773
02:41:05.350 --> 02:41:09.120
so that's one of the things like we don't really have in our sport,
like,
uh,

2774
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:13.770
you know,
our,
the way we score around,
we didn't really score it cause we don't,

2775
02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:17.370
we don't have like a rubric where we're given a sign value for techniques as

2776
02:41:17.371 --> 02:41:20.900
they happen.
So we don't,
that's not what we're doing.
And also,
and,

2777
02:41:20.910 --> 02:41:23.460
but I think that's a good idea for training.

2778
02:41:23.730 --> 02:41:26.970
It's hard to do it the way Eddie does that,
uh,
lived,

2779
02:41:26.971 --> 02:41:29.040
went around because who can write all of that?
What,

2780
02:41:29.041 --> 02:41:31.030
I'll take your eyes off for a second.
Right,
right.

2781
02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:34.260
And you take your eyes off just for one second.
You missed,

2782
02:41:34.500 --> 02:41:37.380
you might miss something that was huge,
you know,
and so I'm,

2783
02:41:37.381 --> 02:41:40.830
so that's why a lot of,
uh,
commissions,
you know,
I think Eddie,

2784
02:41:40.831 --> 02:41:44.490
what he did was he had like,
he wrote kicks punches.

2785
02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:48.780
He has a sort of shorthand system,
I guess.
Right?
Exes,
the sides.

2786
02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.790
Every time someone took something down and put a little X.

2787
02:41:50.791 --> 02:41:53.700
And I encourage people to do that.
And so that's what I do.
Like I,
I,
you know,

2788
02:41:53.730 --> 02:41:55.680
well I tell them,
you know,
I show them other,

2789
02:41:55.681 --> 02:41:59.130
like different people have different systems of shorthand to take some notes

2790
02:41:59.340 --> 02:42:02.640
because,
uh,
in the back you want to,
you're going to want to have some notes,

2791
02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:05.940
especially when,
um,
when the matches are done,
you know,
this,

2792
02:42:05.941 --> 02:42:08.790
they'd say there's a split decision or there's a split round,

2793
02:42:08.791 --> 02:42:12.710
there's an outside judge.
Um,
everybody's going to be getting their,
their,

2794
02:42:12.720 --> 02:42:16.960
a game to get to their reasonings why they gave it that.
Oh wait.
So that's a,

2795
02:42:16.961 --> 02:42:18.440
you're going to have to be able to talk about.

2796
02:42:18.450 --> 02:42:22.200
So that's a good way of a scoring around is preparing yourself to be able to

2797
02:42:22.470 --> 02:42:24.150
talk about what you actually saw,

2798
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:28.770
what happened and context to the scoring criteria.
That's awesome.

2799
02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:32.130
And then this certificate is from you.
Is that how it works?
Well,

2800
02:42:32.150 --> 02:42:33.330
just cause from me,

2801
02:42:33.540 --> 02:42:37.200
but recognized by certain organizations that are going to make it so that you

2802
02:42:37.201 --> 02:42:38.034
can get a job.

2803
02:42:38.070 --> 02:42:42.120
So it's from me and here in the United States is registered and recognized by

2804
02:42:42.121 --> 02:42:45.720
the Association of Boxing Commissions.
And if you're going to apply to,

2805
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:48.390
let's say Cammo here in California,
uh,

2806
02:42:48.391 --> 02:42:52.140
you're going to have to have a certificate of training before you apply it to

2807
02:42:52.350 --> 02:42:54.270
the amateur or before you apply it to,

2808
02:42:54.271 --> 02:42:58.830
let's say the boxing commission out in Tennessee to a athletic commission out

2809
02:42:58.831 --> 02:43:00.540
there or the athletic commission in Nevada.

2810
02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:04.290
They're only going to hire people who have taken a course.

2811
02:43:04.291 --> 02:43:07.940
That's a recognize that John does one as well.
Um,

2812
02:43:08.100 --> 02:43:12.010
a couple of other people do them.
That's excellent.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Big Johns is

2813
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:15.670
<v 0>coming up in June that will fight week.
Weekend does a big one.</v>

2814
02:43:15.671 --> 02:43:20.410
June 6th and seventh.
I just did my,
um,
June 6th and seventh were out.

2815
02:43:20.411 --> 02:43:22.590
Do you know where in Nevada and so,
yeah,

2816
02:43:22.591 --> 02:43:26.620
if you look for is a it for social media is a UFC card that weekend.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2817
02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.950
It's a sway.
Does it then?
Yeah.
I'm just given,
given,

2818
02:43:30.130 --> 02:43:33.580
given a plug to my competition,
but it's okay.
It's okay to the end of the day,

2819
02:43:33.581 --> 02:43:35.830
we want people to get some good training and get information.
Well,

2820
02:43:35.831 --> 02:43:38.650
big John is not competition anymore.
Now he's a commentator.
Yeah.

2821
02:43:38.651 --> 02:43:42.440
But for my training from a guy,
he's never as competition as a referee.
I mean,

2822
02:43:42.460 --> 02:43:45.100
yeah,
we were trying to do it,
but as far as for my course,

2823
02:43:45.101 --> 02:43:47.790
I'm want to take my course,
but if they're not going to take mine,

2824
02:43:47.791 --> 02:43:50.540
I don't want him to take his,
no,
he's,
he's awesome too.
Yeah,
no,
that's,

2825
02:43:51.090 --> 02:43:51.910
that's a few,

2826
02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:55.690
a few guys that I get very excited when I see that they're refereeing a big

2827
02:43:55.691 --> 02:43:59.980
fight of my career.
Okay.
And I'll pick John.
Definitely big John.
I know.

2828
02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:03.370
Yeah.
I've always felt very comfortable.
Damn.

2829
02:44:03.371 --> 02:44:06.430
He's been in there from the very beginning.
From the beginning.

2830
02:44:06.520 --> 02:44:11.520
I mean there is not a person alive that has more old school credibility than big

2831
02:44:11.681 --> 02:44:14.830
John and more high level fights.
Oh yeah,
man.
Yeah.

2832
02:44:15.130 --> 02:44:17.560
And he's seen it all the good,
the bad.

2833
02:44:17.710 --> 02:44:22.630
You remember Marillo Bustamante versus um,
Matt Lindland.
Oh yeah,
he,

2834
02:44:22.670 --> 02:44:24.070
he had a tap him twice.

2835
02:44:24.510 --> 02:44:28.630
I think John stopped it and then Matt Lindland complained that they let them

2836
02:44:28.631 --> 02:44:32.020
fight again and like,
oh,
you're going to go bring up of,
yeah.
I agree.

2837
02:44:32.040 --> 02:44:36.070
Good luck though that,
oh,
what about the other one to right?
A Conan and uh,

2838
02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:39.190
oh yeah,
someone Raba in Jan.
Yeah.

2839
02:44:39.190 --> 02:44:42.340
The Japanese made them fight again on the same night.

2840
02:44:42.341 --> 02:44:45.040
What in the fuck is that ever happen?
We're going to happen again.

2841
02:44:45.850 --> 02:44:50.500
And that was for a punch to stopped from a punch.
Right.
He dropped down,

2842
02:44:50.501 --> 02:44:55.490
grabbed a hold of the ankle coin,
like he fell,
but that's the way soccer shoots.

2843
02:44:56.040 --> 02:45:00.550
He shoots like this.
It looks like he,
you know,
like he's going out.
Yeah.

2844
02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:05.290
Yeah.
And then caught Conan and an arm bar in the second fight.

2845
02:45:05.291 --> 02:45:08.140
The second time they fought that night,
that night.
And that was like crazy.

2846
02:45:08.141 --> 02:45:10.810
We couldn't believe a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu blackbelt could get tapped,

2847
02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:15.900
but like what,
what?
And Sakuraba who's smaller than him.
Right.

2848
02:45:16.330 --> 02:45:19.840
And then we realize who soccer rabo soccer.
Robin was.

2849
02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:24.040
He to me really carried the flag of catch wrestling.

2850
02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:29.200
Then Karl gotch style of of submission holds you more so than probably anybody

2851
02:45:30.011 --> 02:45:33.010
else.
Oh,
you ever fought in MMA?
Yeah,
definitely.

2852
02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:36.980
His style was all Camorra's and armbars.
Yeah.

2853
02:45:37.120 --> 02:45:38.740
Remember when he used to tape his legs up?

2854
02:45:38.741 --> 02:45:42.280
It looked like the guy could barely walk.
Man.
How the fuck was he fighting?

2855
02:45:42.281 --> 02:45:45.970
So good.
His legs would be mama five.
And he's doing submission wrestling now.

2856
02:45:45.971 --> 02:45:50.300
Right.
He's fighting he fighting quintet,
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

2857
02:45:50.830 --> 02:45:55.760
yeah.
He fought the,
his crew,
uh,
fought Eddie Bravo was crew.

2858
02:45:56.350 --> 02:46:00.630
He friend Richie tapped him.
My friend Richard Martinez.
Boogeyman.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

2859
02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:03.920
He got him in a lot for these bad mother fucker about to deal with it.

2860
02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:09.240
Unless you're 100% full time grappler and boogies got nasty dark chokes economy

2861
02:46:09.451 --> 02:46:13.300
that Doris and he's got that all that break dance.
Yes.

2862
02:46:14.300 --> 02:46:18.680
His flexibility
and his,
uh,
his dexterity is ridiculous.

2863
02:46:19.130 --> 02:46:21.620
I feel like,
you know,
there's some people you say,
okay,
he's good.

2864
02:46:21.890 --> 02:46:26.180
Then there's some people you look at it,
so like I've never got to,
you know,

2865
02:46:26.181 --> 02:46:29.000
roll with him,
but he looks like one of those people that like,

2866
02:46:29.150 --> 02:46:32.090
you don't know what it feels like until you feel it getting me.
Yeah.

2867
02:46:32.380 --> 02:46:35.840
He's a very strong,
yeah.
His brother is two CIOs very strong too,

2868
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:40.130
but then they came from that dancing background where they just have the ability

2869
02:46:40.131 --> 02:46:42.950
to manipulate their bodies.
So on you,
it's almost like a gymnast,
you know?
Right,

2870
02:46:42.951 --> 02:46:43.784
right,
exactly.

2871
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:46.490
But maybe even more so because they'll like do a lot of stuff where they're

2872
02:46:46.491 --> 02:46:51.320
standing on one arm and bouncing around in the Lotus position on one arm in arm

2873
02:46:51.321 --> 02:46:54.200
handstand with their legs criss crossed up in the air and they're bouncing

2874
02:46:54.201 --> 02:46:55.610
around.
It makes you want to give up.

2875
02:46:58.900 --> 02:47:01.780
No need for me to do this.
I can't get yoga,
man.
You'd get,

2876
02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:03.560
you're going to be amazed if you keep with it,

2877
02:47:03.561 --> 02:47:06.890
how much dexterity improves and your balance approves and everything.

2878
02:47:07.160 --> 02:47:11.270
But we were talking about it before the podcast started that it's so good for

2879
02:47:11.271 --> 02:47:15.890
your old injuries,
especially that hot yoga.
It's,
I'm a,

2880
02:47:16.160 --> 02:47:18.620
I mean,
you know,
I'm,
I'm probably a little bit annoying right now.

2881
02:47:18.621 --> 02:47:22.500
I'm like a little Bikram Yoga evangelist.
You're

2882
02:47:24.610 --> 02:47:28.580
Brazilian Jujitsu,
blue belts been born again.
I love,
you know,

2883
02:47:30.040 --> 02:47:33.380
I've,
I'm guilty as charged.
I do that shit all the time.

2884
02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:37.650
I think that with everything I liked though,
get annoying.
It's fun.
I get,

2885
02:47:37.700 --> 02:47:40.970
I've been doing it in other countries too.
So like really when I don't take,

2886
02:47:40.971 --> 02:47:45.380
when I take those breaks,
that's what gets me,
you know,
derails me.
So I'm like,

2887
02:47:45.381 --> 02:47:48.380
you know,
I'm gonna do the extra work,
find a place when I get there.

2888
02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:53.380
So I got to go do it in Prague and Warsaw and don't want Saint Petersburg and

2889
02:47:54.321 --> 02:47:57.470
there's a little different flavor,
you know what I mean?
So it's cool.
That's dope.

2890
02:47:57.920 --> 02:48:02.180
Yeah.
I'm a big fan.
I like to do it on the road to,
mostly I do it at home,

2891
02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:06.680
but it's just,
it also that strain of that 90 minutes,

2892
02:48:06.681 --> 02:48:09.080
I think it's like meditative.
There's music,

2893
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:13.490
you're just in the poses for 90 minutes.
It's cleansing.
It releases your,
the,

2894
02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:17.360
all the bullshit you hold on to in your brain.
It just,
yeah,
no it does.
Yeah.

2895
02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:20.990
Sweeps that out the door.
No,
it helps with all of that.
Herb Dean,

2896
02:48:20.991 --> 02:48:24.650
we've been talking for three hours.
Oh really?
You believe that shit?
Wow.
Crazy.

2897
02:48:24.700 --> 02:48:25.650
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2898
02:48:26.330 --> 02:48:29.170
Do you know what actually it's kind of cool because we hang out with each other

2899
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:32.110
a lot,
but this is the first time we got to talk for three hours.
I know,
right?

2900
02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:33.640
When we see each other for years.
Yeah.

2901
02:48:33.641 --> 02:48:36.320
Every time we talked dinner together or hang out at the fights,

2902
02:48:36.321 --> 02:48:39.620
it's like brief conversation brief.
It's at the airport.
You know what I mean?

2903
02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:43.820
Spunk.
Piss that you're not going to be in Atlanta this weekend man.
Yeah,
Dan.

2904
02:48:43.890 --> 02:48:47.360
Oh yeah.
No.
What the fuck,
how does that work?

2905
02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:49.510
Like how do you know like when you do and don't get,

2906
02:48:49.511 --> 02:48:52.340
sometimes they call me and you know there's some athletic commissions.

2907
02:48:52.341 --> 02:48:55.400
I know we're going to call me.
I Atlanta.
I thought it would be one of those that,

2908
02:48:55.430 --> 02:48:57.410
cause I've usually done it when they've been there.
I've done it.

2909
02:48:57.710 --> 02:49:00.320
How often did they tell you in advance and they don't tell me that.

2910
02:49:00.321 --> 02:49:04.250
Sometimes they tell me far,
sometimes not so far.
So some commissioners,
they,

2911
02:49:04.270 --> 02:49:07.890
you know,
they get them on board.
Like I got about,
uh,

2912
02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:14.070
<v 1>uh,
the Minnesota,
uh,
pretty early.
He reached out,</v>

2913
02:49:14.071 --> 02:49:16.530
he was aggressive about getting me on there and he was like,
man,

2914
02:49:16.531 --> 02:49:19.320
I really appreciate that.
I figured like,
yeah,
the men make,

2915
02:49:19.321 --> 02:49:21.840
wants to make sure I'm there.
This Brazil show that's coming up.

2916
02:49:21.990 --> 02:49:25.230
Cristiana the commission.
He reached out to me a long time ago.

2917
02:49:25.260 --> 02:49:28.620
Beautiful and said,
hey man,
I'm going to make sure you're at this on card.
Uh,

2918
02:49:29.330 --> 02:49:31.860
the Brazil car.
Let me see who is on that car.
Let's look that up.

2919
02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:33.190
<v 5>Okay,</v>

2920
02:49:33.190 --> 02:49:35.010
<v 1>let's see who was on that card.
I think there's a,</v>

2921
02:49:35.070 --> 02:49:37.720
there's some good fights there isn't Aldo fight on that card?

2922
02:49:37.900 --> 02:49:39.460
He's got like a big fight on that card.

2923
02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:40.970
<v 5>Okay.</v>

2924
02:49:40.970 --> 02:49:44.380
<v 1>All those in a comeback search right now after knocking out natto mercado.</v>

2925
02:49:44.540 --> 02:49:49.150
I mean,
that was gigantic.
It might not be labeled yet.

2926
02:49:50.410 --> 02:49:54.840
Sometimes like the UFC doesn't put it up on its website.
You know the,
the,

2927
02:49:55.090 --> 02:49:59.260
they don't put it up.
What's that?
Oh,
row.

2928
02:49:59.740 --> 02:50:03.520
Is that Jessica and drudge?
Ooh.
Oh yeah.

2929
02:50:04.610 --> 02:50:07.480
Oh,
that girl's a little pit bull.

2930
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:12.250
Jessica and drudge is terrifying.
Do you see that knockout of Carlina?
Kovacevich

2931
02:50:13.980 --> 02:50:17.710
yeah,
she came owed her.
Would that overhand right?
Jesus Anderson Silva.

2932
02:50:17.760 --> 02:50:21.510
Jared Canon near Holy Shit.
Although that's right.

2933
02:50:21.511 --> 02:50:25.110
Fall Canal Ski.
That's a fucking fight.

2934
02:50:25.530 --> 02:50:28.190
Aldo and Alexander Volkan ops keep poking off.

2935
02:50:28.200 --> 02:50:30.540
Ski is a fucking Juggernaut.

2936
02:50:31.450 --> 02:50:36.450
Little Nog still throwing down all these years later against Ryan Span Tiago

2937
02:50:37.930 --> 02:50:41.770
Alvarez against star Poli.
I don't know that gentleman.

2938
02:50:42.270 --> 02:50:42.820
<v 5>Okay,</v>

2939
02:50:42.820 --> 02:50:45.850
<v 1>man.

Oh,
Shit.
Might have to have a fight companion.

2942
02:50:56.740 --> 02:50:59.350
We haven't had a fight companion forever.
A couple of herb.

2943
02:50:59.351 --> 02:51:01.730
You should sit in on one of those.
If you're in town,
man,
I would love to.

2944
02:51:01.870 --> 02:51:05.860
They're the best.
Yeah.
Okay.
Good.
People get ridiculously hammered.

2945
02:51:05.861 --> 02:51:08.830
And if Eddie Bravo starts throwing around conspiracy theories,

2946
02:51:08.831 --> 02:51:12.130
you've got to check your watch.
Right,

2950

That's what it sounds like.
Yeah.
Brazilian one.
Okay.

We'll get you in for one of these.
We should get good cause let's,

2952
02:51:29.170 --> 02:51:31.030
most of the time it's not the four of us.

2953
02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:34.870
Most of the time it's like two or three and so we always have room for others.

2954
02:51:35.870 --> 02:51:40.300
You're a bad mother fucker.
I appreciate you always cool.
