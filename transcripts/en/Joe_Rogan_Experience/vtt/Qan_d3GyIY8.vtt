<v Speaker 1>people sound like,</v>

30
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>but for whatever fucking reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeble are so super sensitive about just</v>

32
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>a little good natured joking around.</v>

33

34
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 2>I got in trouble the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to our fi,</v>

35
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 2>like a five star restaurant called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ritz.</v>

36
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:02.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you ever heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

37
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 2>like the most widest place ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there was four waiters,</v>

38
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:10.291
<v Speaker 2>one for just your glasses and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>all standing by your tables for my </v>

39
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 2>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I twittered a joke.</v>

40
00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

41
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:12.910
<v Speaker 2>I really wish they would let black </v>
<v Speaker 2>people in here.</v>

42
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:14.680
<v Speaker 2>Ha ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know as a joke.</v>

43
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 2>And people got so fucking pissed off at </v>
<v Speaker 2>me and I had to explain like,</v>

44
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.540
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was making fun of that.</v>

45
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 2>I was making fun how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how wide,</v>

46
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 2>how wide it was and how it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>disgusting.</v>

47
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are Super God damn sensitive.</v>

48
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>I made one fucking joke and I think the </v>
<v Speaker 1>joke was because there was something </v>

49
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.841
<v Speaker 1>real obvious in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it was and my response to </v>

50
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:41.851
<v Speaker 1>it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're telling us some shit that we </v>

51
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:41.851
<v Speaker 1>already knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

<v Speaker 1>people don't tip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

54
00:02:45.761 --> 00:02:47.320

55
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a known thing that if you work in </v>

56
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times black people don't tip.</v>

57
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 1>If you're black and you tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God bless Ya.</v>

58
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying there's anything wrong </v>

59
00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.560
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am from Italian descent.</v>

60
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish and I have said on many occasions </v>

<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

64
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 1>Italians make some bad ass food and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain Robert Deniro,</v>

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 1>I was a racist thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you see what I'm saying?</v>

234
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:43.490
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is fine automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck to your hands.</v>

235
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 1>What would happen is we walked into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackest neighborhood we could find.</v>

236
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

237
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:53.511
<v Speaker 1>there was literally no white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing and everybody was super </v>

238
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 1>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:59.241
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a negative experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was something that I wrote on </v>

240
00:10:59.241 --> 00:10:59.241
<v Speaker 1>on twitter that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

241
00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 1>we all went to see a planet of the apes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a black neighborhood and experience.</v>

242
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I highly recommend all these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people started calling me a racist.</v>

243
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of twitter.</v>

244
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.950
<v Speaker 1>People do what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you were racist.</v>

245
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like black people were saying,</v>

246
00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

247
00:11:13.561 --> 00:11:18.561
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am saying it was a positive </v>

248
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:21.321
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would sit on highly recommended and </v>

249
00:11:21.321 --> 00:11:22.050
<v Speaker 1>it was a black neighborhood and we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

250
00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're so we're so deeply </v>

251
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.050
<v Speaker 1>heartbroken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized like,</v>

252
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's black.</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

255
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And then a bunch of people recognize me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want to take some </v>

256
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:34.520
<v Speaker 1>pictures and it's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's cool and friendly.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Coolest shit.</v>

261

268
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:57.160

<v Speaker 1>This is not a negative story.</v>

269
00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>So then we go into the movie theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

270
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 1>It's me,</v>

<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

272
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:07.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe one other white person movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>theater filled with black people and </v>

273
00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:07.930
<v Speaker 1>they are having a good fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

274
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:12.931
<v Speaker 1>people always complain that black people</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to the movie theater and talk to </v>

275
00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:12.931
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes they do.</v>

276
00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's good.</v>

277
00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>That's totally fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:19.120
<v Speaker 1>If that's what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so way I felt like I'm like,</v>

279
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in their neighborhood.</v>

280
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.650
<v Speaker 1>This is how they go to the movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck am I to be offended by how </v>

281
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.290
<v Speaker 1>they liked to go to the movies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

282
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>they were at the movies and I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying all black neighborhoods do this,</v>

283
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 1>but this particular black neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people brought babies,</v>

284
00:12:31.901 --> 00:12:36.901
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of people with </v>

285
00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:36.901
<v Speaker 1>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

286
00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:36.901
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't just one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

287
00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:38.980
<v Speaker 1>these people in front of us walked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had toddlers,</v>

288
00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:44.130
<v Speaker 1>like little two year olds sitting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their lap to see planet of the apes at </v>

289
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.630
<v Speaker 1>like 10:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a Friday night.</v>

290
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

291
00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't give a fuck.</v>

292
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.550
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you what made me really </v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous and made me feel kind of weird,</v>

293
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:58.740
<v Speaker 1>was watching all of these previews of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these different TV shows or all </v>

294
00:12:59.891 --> 00:13:04.891
<v Speaker 1>these different movies around them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are coming out and I'm watching these </v>

295
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:08.041
<v Speaker 1>movies and all of them are about white </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and I'm sitting there and I'm </v>

296
00:13:08.591 --> 00:13:09.130
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

297
00:13:09.131 --> 00:13:12.640
<v Speaker 1>this is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like w imagined being a blank person.</v>

298
00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And I always thought like people would </v>
<v Speaker 1>complain.</v>

299
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Like I'd hear Black People Complain </v>
<v Speaker 1>About,</v>

300
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.360
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no films for black people.</v>

301
00:13:19.361 --> 00:13:21.970
<v Speaker 1>There's no roles for black actors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'd be like,</v>

302
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 1>so you go make your movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do you want from me?</v>

303
00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:29.250
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you go to a goddamn movie </v>

304
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 1>theater with all black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when you really feel it.</v>

305
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm sitting there in the audience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all these people are black,</v>

306
00:13:34.001 --> 00:13:36.580
<v Speaker 1>but every movie preview is white.</v>

307
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.720
<v Speaker 1>There's no black characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally there's this movie with</v>

308
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:45.721
<v Speaker 1>Jonah Hill and they show a preview for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie and it's Jonah Hill and he's </v>

309
00:13:45.721 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Speaker 1>doing all this different shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's babysitting kids,</v>

310
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:53.010
<v Speaker 1>but he's supposed to be like a cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way they show you who's he's a </v>

311
00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.071
<v Speaker 1>cool guy is there's an old black guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>working like at a door at a club like </v>

312
00:13:56.081 --> 00:13:58.750
<v Speaker 1>the black guys there and Jonah Hill's </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking black to them,</v>

313
00:13:58.751 --> 00:13:59.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is,</v>

314

<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

315
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:05.550
<v Speaker 1>And I'm watching this with all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>black people watching this white guy </v>

316
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.310
<v Speaker 1>talk like a black guy and I'm in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking theater film.</v>

317
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm high as fuck.</v>

320
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:21.480

<v Speaker 1>No one knew why black people are angry </v>

321
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:21.480
<v Speaker 1>and they feel disenfranchised.</v>

322
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Like they're completely removed from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream cultural experience in a lot </v>

323
00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:30.511
<v Speaker 1>of ways like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a tiny percentage of black </v>

324
00:14:30.511 --> 00:14:31.720
<v Speaker 1>people that are included in movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So finally planet of the apes place,</v>

325
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>everyone's white in the movie except the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad guy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>13 believer or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

348
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>because the violence is all sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>implied like,</v>

349
00:15:34.911 --> 00:15:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know what the fuck went down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't really show it to you,</v>

350
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's not removed from violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrifying movie and the like,</v>

351
00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:42.400
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

352
00:15:42.401 --> 00:15:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

353
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 1>One of the old ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch?</v>

354
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched all of it.</v>

355
00:15:49.401 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 1>All five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watched all of them.</v>

356
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 1>And what'd you think of the first one is</v>
<v Speaker 1>still sensation.</v>

357
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:53.000
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

358
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:58.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself back in the </v>

359
00:15:58.001 --> 00:15:58.001
<v Speaker 1>time because back in the time it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great movie.</v>

360
00:15:58.001 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 1>It's like a lot of movies they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold up because you,</v>

361
00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:05.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to realize that culturally </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings have evolved in a shoot way</v>

362
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.520
<v Speaker 1>from 1970 to 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you want any proof of that </v>

363
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:17.570
<v Speaker 1>something is happening to our culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that things are expanding and moving</v>

364
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:20.540
<v Speaker 1>forward at an exponentially increasing </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

365
00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.430
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is look at old </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

366
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Old Movies are almost unwatchable </v>
<v Speaker 1>unwatchable.</v>

367
00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:30.170
<v Speaker 1>The abd concept is unwatchable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't last that long.</v>

368
00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

369
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:35.960
<v Speaker 1>it's just not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched altered states are </v>

370
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.870
<v Speaker 1>trending ultimate states when I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:45.611
<v Speaker 1>and I got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned about the isolation tank from </v>

375
00:16:45.611 --> 00:16:45.611
<v Speaker 1>that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned about Iowasca from that movie.</v>

376
00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.740
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot of Shit from that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That movie was a big fucking 84 or </v>

377
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.160
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

378
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:54.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm just talking out of my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing though,</v>

379
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.020
<v Speaker 1>that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>altered states.</v>

380
00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not the Christopher Walken away </v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was in 1980 or even earlier than we </v>

382
00:17:05.171 --> 00:17:05.171
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty one years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Especially with Iowasca being so </v>

386
00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:15.911
<v Speaker 1>popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.090
<v Speaker 1>There was one scene with the do goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

576
00:25:40.091 --> 00:25:43.670
<v Speaker 1>he running shit now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody started laughing.</v>

577
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Diane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started shyman in with their own </v>

578
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:49.230
<v Speaker 1>shit and the women were talking to each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

579
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.830
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that.</v>

580
00:25:50.831 --> 00:25:55.831
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker was happy and it was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth and it went on for a few </v>

581
00:25:55.831 --> 00:25:59.640
<v Speaker 1>seconds where as long as everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was acceptable and then the </v>

582
00:25:59.640 --> 00:25:59.640
<v Speaker 1>movie kept going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was.</v>

583
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.600
<v Speaker 1>They made the movie louder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie was really loud and I was </v>

584
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:03.600
<v Speaker 1>wondering like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

585
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:08.530
<v Speaker 1>they may get loud because people talk in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie theater a wonder because it </v>

586
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.121
<v Speaker 1>was loud as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was such an action movie that </v>

587
00:26:12.121 --> 00:26:12.630
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of moments in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie that where there's like,</v>

588
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.230
<v Speaker 1>you need quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

589
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.930
<v Speaker 1>the movies are good goddamn movie man.</v>

590
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.120
<v Speaker 1>They did it good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was wondering,</v>

591
00:26:19.121 --> 00:26:19.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like,</v>

592
00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:22.360
<v Speaker 1>well I bet the CGI will be cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it would be corny.</v>

593
00:26:22.361 --> 00:26:27.361
<v Speaker 1>Like I didn't like cowboys and aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to see cowboys and aliens and it </v>

594
00:26:27.361 --> 00:26:28.120
<v Speaker 1>was good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a good movie.</v>

595
00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:33.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't hate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was like kind of all over the </v>

596
00:26:33.121 --> 00:26:35.851
<v Speaker 1>road and I'm a huge fan of Jon favreau </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought that Ironman was fucking </v>

597
00:26:35.851 --> 00:26:36.310
<v Speaker 1>awesome and I just love him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

598
00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:40.030
<v Speaker 1>I love him from swingers and I've met </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a couple times and he's super cool.</v>

599
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:41.860
<v Speaker 1>So it was really looking forward to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

600
00:26:41.861 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I love a good alien movie and I love a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good cowboy movie.</v>

601
00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:46.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be perfect.</v>

602
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:51.860
<v Speaker 1>So I was kind of expecting that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet of the apes would kind of be </v>

603
00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.371
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sorta was probably a lot like that </v>

604
00:26:55.371 --> 00:26:55.371
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

605
00:26:55.371 --> 00:26:55.371
<v Speaker 1>No way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

606
00:26:55.371 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It was a strong nine strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine out of 10.</v>

607
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.640
<v Speaker 1>The fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

608
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:04.730
<v Speaker 1>you realize how pathetic and fleshy </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings are when you see like </v>

609
00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.360
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dead.</v>

610
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:08.520
<v Speaker 1>These chimps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super realistic.</v>

611
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you think of like a super athlete,</v>

612
00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:13.200
<v Speaker 1>like a Ray Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think like a brock Lesnar,</v>

614
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:17.730
<v Speaker 1>like the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest super athlete,</v>

615
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:22.731
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you'd look at what like a hundred </v>

616
00:27:22.731 --> 00:27:24.720
<v Speaker 1>and 50 pound chimp does in this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has run shit,</v>

617
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:29.930
<v Speaker 1>throws things around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the way he handles people was so </v>

618
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 1>realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>

619
00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.610
<v Speaker 1>it was really fucking well done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

620
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:37.730
<v Speaker 1>The CGI you're watching it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could still come to town that it's </v>

621
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.420
<v Speaker 1>not really a champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only in the face.</v>

622
00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Only like the ways face moves for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that was like real human,</v>

623
00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 1>like just a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I hair,</v>

624
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 1>they're so close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the gorilla God damn the gorilla </v>

625
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.130
<v Speaker 1>looks good.</v>

626
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.380
<v Speaker 1>There's some scenes where this gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows up,</v>

627
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 1>the gorilla just run shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to tell you anymore.</v>

628
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:57.360
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No spoilers,</v>

629
00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:02.510
<v Speaker 1>but just the way they did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll fucking the way they're able to </v>

630
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.651
<v Speaker 1>have these artificial things interact </v>
<v Speaker 1>with what looks like a real physical </v>

631
00:28:06.651 --> 00:28:10.320
<v Speaker 1>environment like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jump this gorilla smashing things and it</v>

632
00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:12.000
<v Speaker 1>looks real as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

633
00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It looks real as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're getting a a gorilla to do </v>

634
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:17.030
<v Speaker 1>some shit you could never get a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>gorilla to do.</v>

635
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.650
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't get a real gorilla that act</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the way you want it,</v>

636
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:24.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be crazy as in five years </v>

637
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.591
<v Speaker 1>when you rewatch that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna look shit like shit like </v>

638
00:28:27.591 --> 00:28:30.501
<v Speaker 1>going to see I am legend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stupid scene where the lions walk </v>

639
00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:30.540
<v Speaker 1>out like as fake gas line.</v>

640
00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:35.660
<v Speaker 1>It ruins the whole movie for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I think they shouldn't have had </v>

641
00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:36.750
<v Speaker 1>that scene because that line looks so </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>

642
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I can't believe they accepted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid looking fake line.</v>

643
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.750
<v Speaker 1>This is not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is way better than that.</v>

644
00:28:42.751 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 1>This is the next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is next level shit.</v>

645
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:48.210
<v Speaker 1>It's a good plot to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's well made.</v>

646
00:28:48.211 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 1>It's well directed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps you fucking captivated.</v>

647
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:56.070

<v Speaker 1>Kevin's friends was telling me,</v>

719
00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:42.901
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this guy is famous actor,</v>

720
00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:43.750
<v Speaker 1>like literally tried to kill this dude </v>
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

721
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:48.160
<v Speaker 1>but this guy plays the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He plays the preacher in this movie.</v>

722

<v Speaker 1>God Damn is he good?</v>

724
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.140
<v Speaker 1>There's no soundtrack to this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So during the movie,</v>

725
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 1>what I loved about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I love,</v>

726
00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I hate when a movie gives me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

727
00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I loved the planet of the Apes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

728
00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.950
<v Speaker 1>it's a well packaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining vehicle.</v>

729
00:32:05.951 --> 00:32:10.951
<v Speaker 1>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like when a movie plays me </v>

730
00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:11.170
<v Speaker 1>some fucking music and tells me how I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to think.</v>

731
00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

732
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 1>that's retarded to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never enjoyed it.</v>

733
00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I'll tolerate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

734
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:21.160
<v Speaker 1>But I always feel relieved when a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any music,</v>

735
00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.810
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need like the,</v>

736
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.300
<v Speaker 1>they start kissing and fucking violence </v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

737
00:32:25.301 --> 00:32:30.301
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously there's good examples and bad </v>

738
00:32:30.301 --> 00:32:33.601
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's definitely some movies that </v>

739
00:32:33.601 --> 00:32:34.090
<v Speaker 1>the soundtrack is 90 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie [inaudible] I disagree.</v>

740
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind it all and that's different</v>

741
00:32:37.571 --> 00:32:38.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about.</v>

742
00:32:38.401 --> 00:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like some music with songs and</v>

743
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.490
<v Speaker 5>singing and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I like to.</v>

744
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:46.010
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind when I hear led Zeppelin </v>
<v Speaker 5>houses of the holy.</v>

745
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.780
<v Speaker 5>I know it's 74.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's.</v>

746
00:32:47.781 --> 00:32:50.150
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I don't like what you're saying when</v>

747
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:52.830
<v Speaker 5>you hear music to people dressing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>them telling you.</v>

748
00:32:52.831 --> 00:32:57.831
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>In the time period I said it wrong </v>

749
00:32:57.831 --> 00:33:02.180
<v Speaker 5>because it's not that I don't like </v>
<v Speaker 5>soundtracks because I do in goodfellas.</v>

750
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.210
<v Speaker 5>I like it when it's done the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what I'm saying.</v>

751
00:33:05.211 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 5>He accepted up as a boogie nights.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mind that your book,</v>

752
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:14.090
<v Speaker 5>like you remember when the rolling </v>
<v Speaker 5>stones or plan and he's coked up and </v>

753
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.771
<v Speaker 5>he's got a bag full of guns in the trunk</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he's driving around in that movie.</v>

754
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:24.851
<v Speaker 5>It works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What I mean more is the werewolf is </v>

755
00:33:24.851 --> 00:33:27.881
<v Speaker 5>running through the woods and you hear </v>
<v Speaker 5>the fuck out of here with that.</v>

756
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.970
<v Speaker 5>Stupid Shit that drives me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I told them,</v>

757
00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:33.710
<v Speaker 5>there's no music in this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

758
00:33:33.711 --> 00:33:35.930
<v Speaker 5>This music is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This movie is brilliant.</v>

759
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.830
<v Speaker 5>It's kept you and Kevin Smith describes </v>
<v Speaker 5>it as his talking dog movie.</v>

760
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.720
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because if a dog started talking,</v>

761
00:33:41.721 --> 00:33:42.770
<v Speaker 5>he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

762
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:44.630
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's exactly what this movie is like.</v>

763
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:48.340
<v Speaker 5>You don't expect it from Kevin Smith.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you see an early cut of it that they</v>

764
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.910
<v Speaker 5>know it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's done.</v>

765
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.650
<v Speaker 5>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The movie's done.</v>

766
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.470
<v Speaker 5>Kevin did it all himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going to release it all himself.</v>

767
00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:55.830
<v Speaker 5>He did it all himself.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

768
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.760
<v Speaker 5>no one else had any involvement in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's the brilliant.</v>

769
00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:01.390
<v Speaker 5>The brilliance of this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He didn't,</v>

770
00:34:01.391 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was gonna do a mass release of it,</v>

771
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:07.610
<v Speaker 5>but I guess it was just too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he's going to release it in a limited</v>

772
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:08.820
<v Speaker 5>way just so that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

773
00:34:08.821 --> 00:34:09.430
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you can get it on DVD and all that shit.</v>

777
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.880
<v Speaker 5>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a really weird thing,</v>

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

862
00:37:31.521 --> 00:37:34.520
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't Jane Fonda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was written by Roger Ebert.</v>

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Ebro.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That makes zero sense.</v>

866
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:43.330
<v Speaker 4>Hunter was one of the monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Linda Harrison.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh God damn.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You got to watch the first two,</v>

869
00:37:48.581 --> 00:37:49.330
<v Speaker 4>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

870
00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.690
<v Speaker 4>the Heston is a bad motherfucker too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like 50.</v>

871
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.380
<v Speaker 2>Did you know Robert Herbert wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie</v>

872
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:59.100
<v Speaker 4>and it's one of those stories so bad in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the whole entire was.</v>

873
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.040
<v Speaker 4>Of course it is and that's why he's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>critic.</v>

874
00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.540
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always said this.</v>

875
00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:07.541
<v Speaker 4>I've met some good critics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met some cool people who are fans of </v>

876
00:38:07.541 --> 00:38:09.110
<v Speaker 4>movies and there's no hard fast rule to </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

877
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.900
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people like Doug Benson</v>
<v Speaker 4>might as well be a critic.</v>

878
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:14.930
<v Speaker 4>He's a huge movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's still a very good comic,</v>

879
00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.610
<v Speaker 4>but he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a huge movie,</v>

880
00:38:16.611 --> 00:38:21.611
<v Speaker 4>but he might as well be a critic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most critics are critics because </v>

881
00:38:21.611 --> 00:38:24.581
<v Speaker 4>they got nothing to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why they don't want to be </v>

882
00:38:24.581 --> 00:38:24.581
<v Speaker 4>critics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They really want to.</v>

883
00:38:24.581 --> 00:38:25.180
<v Speaker 4>They want to be writers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want to be screenwriters.</v>

884
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:26.960
<v Speaker 4>You want to be authors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have anything to say.</v>

885
00:38:26.990 --> 00:38:28.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe critics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

886
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:29.810
<v Speaker 4>sometimes it wrong.</v>

887
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.340
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I saw Doug Benson said that he</v>

888
00:38:32.341 --> 00:38:36.090
<v Speaker 2>hated that the new planet of the apes </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie didn't fun at the CGI.</v>

889
00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.020
<v Speaker 6>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Let me just start with that.</v>

890
00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:42.050
<v Speaker 6>For the Dragon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is one of the greatest martial </v>

891
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.050
<v Speaker 6>arts films,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all those seven of these movies,</v>

892
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.900
<v Speaker 6>all those clint eastwood movies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all those jobs,</v>

893
00:38:43.901 --> 00:38:48.901
<v Speaker 6>Bronson movies that were stealing from </v>
<v Speaker 6>today that we're remaking all those </v>

894
00:38:48.901 --> 00:38:50.350
<v Speaker 6>westerns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Westerns were in the seventies.</v>

895
00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:54.790
<v Speaker 6>So the time piece was fucking brilliant </v>
<v Speaker 6>that the thinking was brilliant.</v>

896
00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:57.000
<v Speaker 6>It's not these momos knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just remaking shit.</v>

897
00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:01.160

<v Speaker 5>plays a ghost to comes back to town.</v>

<v Speaker 5>don't shoot the head.</v>

900
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:10.730
<v Speaker 5>So every time they shoot the body he </v>
<v Speaker 5>fall down and get back up.</v>

901
00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:11.510

<v Speaker 5>every movie.</v>

913
00:39:33.021 --> 00:39:35.930
<v Speaker 5>He always told them what time it was.</v>

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:29.420
<v Speaker 4>just the underdog or what is that song?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Rob Thomas from matchbox 20 where</v>

<v Speaker 1>the perfect harmony of his voice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santana and [inaudible].</v>

1392
01:01:11.661 --> 01:01:13.190
<v Speaker 5>he can't carry the spread.</v>

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.680

1396
01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:24.911
<v Speaker 5>happened and they replaced them with </v>
<v Speaker 5>that fake fucking Sammy Hagar been open </v>

1397
01:01:24.911 --> 01:01:27.970
<v Speaker 5>for Sabic when they had deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People were spitting out of Philadelphia</v>

1398
01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.600
<v Speaker 5>in Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were rolling,</v>

1399
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:34.630
<v Speaker 5>just spit off their fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They call it like whatever they do when </v>

1400
01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:37.421
<v Speaker 5>they throw it at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember watching fucking singer </v>

1401
01:01:37.421 --> 01:01:40.870
<v Speaker 5>and spit flying by and he's trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>duck and shit.</v>

1402
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.720
<v Speaker 5>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I always did.</v>

1403
01:01:42.721 --> 01:01:47.721
<v Speaker 5>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>did you like David Lee Roth when he did </v>

1404
01:01:47.721 --> 01:01:47.721
<v Speaker 5>his own solar stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

1405
01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:53.280
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>David Lee Roth needed Eddie van Halen </v>

1406
01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:53.330
<v Speaker 5>and Eddie van Halen needed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1407
01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.250
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

1408
01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not just one person man.</v>

1409
01:01:56.961 --> 01:02:01.961
<v Speaker 5>It's fucking teams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the creative juices of everybody </v>

1410
01:02:01.961 --> 01:02:03.050
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the really interesting shit.</v>

1411
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:08.230
<v Speaker 5>It's just hard to get that to work </v>
<v Speaker 5>because you got egos and then he got </v>

1412
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:11.321
<v Speaker 5>Valerie Bertinelli who most likely </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably wanted to fuck David Lee Roth </v>

1413
01:02:11.321 --> 01:02:15.610
<v Speaker 5>but couldn't get them and got Eddie van </v>
<v Speaker 5>Halen instead and then shit got weird </v>

1414
01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:16.730
<v Speaker 5>and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why do you keep them around?</v>

1415
01:02:16.731 --> 01:02:18.840
<v Speaker 5>He's such an Egomaniac,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1416
01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 5>because she really wanted to fuck</v>

1417
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>David Lee Roth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least that's what I would assume.</v>

1418
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.710
<v Speaker 1>But David Lee Roth was cool as fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first guys that like,</v>

1419
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>I came up to me after the show and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually nervous.</v>

1420
01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I was nervous to talk to the ugly raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>and when he was telling me I was funny,</v>

1421

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That was great.</v>

1423
01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea.</v>

1424
01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were just that fear factor</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1425
01:02:37.231 --> 01:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:16.760
<v Speaker 1>it's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is basically las version of the comedy </v>

1489
01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>cellar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except it's not as good.</v>

1490
01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not run the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as like the comedy cellar in </v>

1491
01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:24.300
<v Speaker 1>New York is where all the top guys go </v>
<v Speaker 1>and fuck around and workout.</v>

1492
01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.000
<v Speaker 1>It's known and it's kind of like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant attached to it.</v>

1493
01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:28.960
<v Speaker 1>People eat there and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1494
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Norton Rose wrote his fucking road</v>
<v Speaker 1>is booked there.</v>

1495
01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.900
<v Speaker 1>He brings a laptop and dudes are always </v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out there.</v>

1496
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real,</v>

1497
01:05:36.071 --> 01:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>like a place where all the comics come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in la,</v>

1498
01:05:40.890 --> 01:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>the comedy stores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the closest thing you know,</v>

1499
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000
<v Speaker 1>it was like the closest icon place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Improv is the best club in </v>

1500
01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.200
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the comedy store has the best name.</v>

1501
01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It's get the best feel to get the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>location,</v>

1502
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even to the Long Beach Laugh factory.</v>

1503
01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.230
<v Speaker 1>That's was fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really great.</v>

1504
01:05:58.231 --> 01:06:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Location is a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice.</v>

1505
01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:03.130
<v Speaker 1>What is the deal with that?</v>

1506
01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Can you go if you're not friends with Jo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Koy?</v>

1507
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1508
01:06:07.871 --> 01:06:09.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1509
01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:11.830
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left a job,</v>

1510
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 1>but he used to keep all the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>Filipinos out.</v>

1511
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1512
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:20.430
<v Speaker 1>the Asians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want anybody making any Asian </v>

1513
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.430
<v Speaker 1>jokes and he would work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted only,</v>

1514
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>only his Filipino jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch the,</v>

1515
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.210
<v Speaker 1>didn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Louis show with Louis Ck.</v>

1516
01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I watched it on a line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched that segment.</v>

1517
01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It was more than one segment with Louis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was Dane Cook.</v>

1518
01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.770
<v Speaker 1>It starts off with Jim Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1519
01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it is interesting.</v>

1520
01:06:36.810 --> 01:06:40.480
<v Speaker 1>It was like there's a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>revisionist history there.</v>

1521
01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was unscripted.</v>

1522
01:06:42.371 --> 01:06:44.890
<v Speaker 1>It almost seemed like real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it almost seemed like they actually</v>

1523
01:06:44.891 --> 01:06:47.200
<v Speaker 1>just sat down or like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they worked it out.</v>

1524
01:06:47.201 --> 01:06:49.180
<v Speaker 1>I worked out the beats and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did it,</v>

1525
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't like the arch I did.</v>

1526
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.320
<v Speaker 1>I thought Danes argument was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>

1527
01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Like why didn't you stick up for me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why didn't you didn't say that I </v>

1528
01:06:58.350 --> 01:06:59.100
<v Speaker 1>didn't steal from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1529
01:06:59.101 --> 01:07:00.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I've never stolen.</v>

1530
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Why would I steal a joke?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never told a joke ever.</v>

1531
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Like the argument was like really </v>
<v Speaker 1>strange,</v>

1532
01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:06.040
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1533
01:07:06.070 --> 01:07:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you really think Dane Cook </v>
<v Speaker 1>was guilty,</v>

1534
01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:11.590
<v Speaker 1>then yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one of the jokes.</v>

1535
01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:16.591
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Dane Cook was guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know he saw Louis Ck do those </v>

1536
01:07:16.591 --> 01:07:16.840
<v Speaker 1>jokes before he did them and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

1537
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:21.960
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All three of them are on the same seat </v>

1538
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:24.600
<v Speaker 1>and Louis did those in front of him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it in front of everybody he did </v>

1539
01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:24.600
<v Speaker 1>in front of all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1540
01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Look Louis Ck is the most prolific guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>working today.</v>

1541
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:32.620
<v Speaker 1>He puts out a new hour every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but back then he didn't.</v>

1542
01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Back then Louis was doing the same act </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long fucking time.</v>

1543
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:42.540
<v Speaker 1>So those bits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bit about the guy getting hit by a </v>

1544
01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did that bit for years.</v>

1545
01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.990
<v Speaker 1>She did it before the dude about a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting hit by a car.</v>

1546
01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Steve Martin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1547
01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:48.290
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1548
01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Steve Martin did the naming the child </v>
<v Speaker 1>naming the child a crazy name.</v>

1549
01:07:52.121 --> 01:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>I thought he got the wrong bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1550
01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I hit by a car too,</v>

1551
01:07:56.050 --> 01:08:01.050
<v Speaker 1>about what you're trying to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something to them really well or </v>

1552
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:01.390
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

1553
01:08:01.391 --> 01:08:06.391
<v Speaker 1>I think you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure </v>

1554
01:08:06.391 --> 01:08:10.051
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure the Steve Martin joke </v>

1555
01:08:10.051 --> 01:08:10.051
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1556
01:08:10.051 --> 01:08:11.420
<v Speaker 1>and this is true that Steve Martin came </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with a um,</v>

1557
01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:16.600
<v Speaker 1>a bit that's really similar to both </v>
<v Speaker 1>Danes bit and Louis Ck is bid that if I </v>

1558
01:08:17.001 --> 01:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>have a kid I'm going to name them some </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy name.</v>

1559
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.390
<v Speaker 1>It's unpronounceable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1560
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:22.630
<v Speaker 1>this is being silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's not,</v>

1561
01:08:22.690 --> 01:08:24.440
<v Speaker 1>that's not stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1562
01:08:24.890 --> 01:08:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
01:08:28.410 --> 01:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of stealing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look if those guys had heard Steve </v>

1564
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Martin and forgot about it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduce the joke,</v>

1565
01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I didn't realize that they had a </v>

1566
01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just forgotten it,</v>

1567
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to stop doing it once you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear it about Steve Martin's bit.</v>

1568
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>But the difference is Louis was doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of Dane.</v>

1569
01:08:48.650 --> 01:08:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So whether or not Dane is a joke thief </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1570
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:52.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1571
01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I liked Dane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a talented guy.</v>

1572
01:08:55.071 --> 01:08:57.740
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a great marketer and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think he's a good person.</v>

1573
01:08:57.741 --> 01:09:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also think he's wildly ambitious,</v>

1574
01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that sometimes when you're </v>

1575
01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:08.090
<v Speaker 1>wildly ambitious you don't even realize </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and you're doing it.</v>

1576
01:09:08.090 --> 01:09:13.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't mean to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you start doing it and those bits </v>

1577
01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:14.000
<v Speaker 1>work and then you don't want to let them</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

1578
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And even though someone's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

1579
01:09:15.801 --> 01:09:20.801
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like Joe Diaz was bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to let them go because </v>

1580
01:09:20.801 --> 01:09:22.430
<v Speaker 1>they are weapons and you use them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>use them to get what you want,</v>

1581
01:09:22.431 --> 01:09:24.830
<v Speaker 1>which is you want love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want that love and adulation.</v>

1582
01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:29.831
<v Speaker 1>You want to be killing up there and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get addicted to it and you can't let it </v>

1583
01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:29.831
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he's addicted to,</v>

1584
01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:31.130
<v Speaker 1>if he's guilty of anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's guilty of that.</v>

1585
01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I thought it was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument was weird.</v>

1586
01:09:33.951 --> 01:09:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1587
01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1588
01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.380
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I liked how Louis such a good dude,</v>

1589
01:09:39.381 --> 01:09:40.090
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1590
01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:45.091
<v Speaker 1>like even his whole way he's approaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>it like I didn't like what people were </v>

1591
01:09:45.091 --> 01:09:46.580
<v Speaker 1>saying about you and I didn't like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people were getting mad at you.</v>

1592
01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:47.540
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

1593
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Like he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just,</v>

1594
01:09:48.531 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1595
01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:53.500
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why he's doing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well is that he's his,</v>

1596
01:09:53.501 --> 01:09:58.501
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way he thinks is a good way to </v>

1597
01:09:58.501 --> 01:09:58.501
<v Speaker 1>think he's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1598
01:09:58.501 --> 01:10:02.840
<v Speaker 1>He sticks to his fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not like these other folks that we </v>

1599
01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.930
<v Speaker 1>have around 24 fucking hours a day that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen Louis.</v>

1600
01:10:04.931 --> 01:10:09.931
<v Speaker 1>He came up to me with the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to host on Sunday nights and he </v>

1601
01:10:09.931 --> 01:10:10.640
<v Speaker 1>would come up and do a set every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very polite.</v>

1602
01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 1>One night he came up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

1603

<v Speaker 1>He took my name and number or like,</v>

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good at grammar coke and never </v>

1608
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:25.350
<v Speaker 1>thought anything of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later he called me.</v>

1609
01:10:25.350 --> 01:10:26.810
<v Speaker 1>He paid me more than anybody else has </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever paid me,</v>

1610
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:29.390
<v Speaker 1>and he took care of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had me there for the weekend.</v>

1611
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:32.870
<v Speaker 1>He came with his word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of that I give him my loyalty</v>

1612
01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:35.210
<v Speaker 1>forever because he's one of the few of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

1613
01:10:35.211 --> 01:10:37.650
<v Speaker 1>All of these fucking weak motherfuckers </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got around this.</v>

1614
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.910
<v Speaker 1>That sticks to his fucking word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a real.</v>

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Beasley motherfucking prompts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Louis deserves my heart because he </v>

1617
01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:50.660
<v Speaker 1>put me on television without every </v>
<v Speaker 1>expecting anything from me.</v>

1618
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:52.790
<v Speaker 1>And he just told me he was like put me </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

1619

1622
01:11:04.401 --> 01:11:06.140
<v Speaker 1>and I think to everybody because he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most prolific,</v>

1623
01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:09.650

1626
01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:18.900
<v Speaker 1>there's some moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment when we were hanging out at </v>

<v Speaker 6>you sit,</v>

1633
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:36.050

<v Speaker 1>He's the best.</v>

1641
01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Nobody makes me laugh harder than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Louis Ck is more prolific.</v>

1642
01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:59.030
<v Speaker 1>He's the most prolific,</v>

1643
01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:04.180
<v Speaker 6>cool conversations about standing up </v>
<v Speaker 6>with Louis or my act and my life has </v>

1644
01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:04.340
<v Speaker 6>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm telling you this right off the bat,</v>

1645
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.760
<v Speaker 6>I believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had to.</v>

1646
01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:11.000
<v Speaker 6>I think he's changing the way a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>comics do it and he's making guys write </v>

1647
01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.321
<v Speaker 6>more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was the conversation that you had </v>

1648
01:12:15.321 --> 01:12:17.451
<v Speaker 6>with them?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had a conversation about storytelling </v>

1649
01:12:17.451 --> 01:12:18.780
<v Speaker 6>and about jokes and he said that he had </v>
<v Speaker 6>watched me and that,</v>

1650
01:12:18.781 --> 01:12:21.690
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the material was a little fucking crazy,</v>

1651
01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:23.160
<v Speaker 6>but he loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He respected it,</v>

1652
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:25.890
<v Speaker 6>but he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have so much more to tell people.</v>

1653
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:29.250
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want you to talk about what is dark to</v>

1654
01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:34.251
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I started talking about </v>

1655
01:12:34.251 --> 01:12:35.871
<v Speaker 6>mugging the hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why I started talking about all </v>

1656
01:12:35.871 --> 01:12:36.990
<v Speaker 6>the crimes I had done outline and that's</v>
<v Speaker 6>why I'm writing them on stage.</v>

1657
01:12:36.991 --> 01:12:39.030
<v Speaker 6>Now you know what you need to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 6>onstage,</v>

1658
01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:44.120
<v Speaker 6>what brother you need to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 6>finding your dead mother when you were </v>

1659
01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:44.120
<v Speaker 6>high on acid.</v>

1660
01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:45.980
<v Speaker 6>How fucking craziest you gotta.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I know Joe.</v>

01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:53.010
<v Speaker 6>I got nowhere to go after you find your </v>
<v Speaker 6>dead mother on the floor.</v>

1664
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:55.500
<v Speaker 6>Jesus can't follow you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus can't.</v>

1665
01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:56.550
<v Speaker 6>Fuck.</v>

<v Speaker 6>So bad,</v>

1669
01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:07.050

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Show it a one man show setting.</v>

1676
01:13:17.341 --> 01:13:20.220
<v Speaker 6>I could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at the comedy show I cannot do it.</v>

1677
01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.490
<v Speaker 6>It's too hard to recover from it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What does that mean?</v>

1678
01:13:24.050 --> 01:13:29.050
<v Speaker 2>He just tried to change this act over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the weekend and Ontario and Katt </v>

1679
01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:29.540
<v Speaker 2>Williams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell me what happened.</v>

1680
01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1681
01:13:30.670 --> 01:13:35.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to do something different </v>

1682
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:35.670
<v Speaker 2>supposedly like he tried to do more of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious,</v>

1683
01:13:35.670 --> 01:13:39.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like one man shows where </v>

1684
01:13:39.330 --> 01:13:40.250
<v Speaker 2>California Improv Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1685
01:13:40.251 --> 01:13:42.290
<v Speaker 2>And then the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I knew he was there,</v>

1686
01:13:42.291 --> 01:13:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't want to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wasn't having it.</v>

1687
01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:49.690
<v Speaker 2>And so they started like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess booing or doing something like </v>

1688
01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:52.511
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a cat starts screaming at him </v>

1689
01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:52.511
<v Speaker 2>or doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the Ontario Improv.</v>

1690
01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:52.970
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

1691
01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:57.971
<v Speaker 2>all based off tmz a interior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've kicked them off stage and kicked </v>

1692
01:13:57.971 --> 01:14:02.951
<v Speaker 2>them out of the building and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't leave and so then they called </v>

1693
01:14:02.951 --> 01:14:05.771
<v Speaker 2>the police and the police had to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>them off the premises and they canceled </v>

1694
01:14:05.771 --> 01:14:05.771
<v Speaker 2>the whole weekend.</v>

1695
01:14:05.771 --> 01:14:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Well he's definitely crazy because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps getting arrested and there's a lot</v>

1696
01:14:09.271 --> 01:14:14.271
<v Speaker 1>of shit going on with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got caught with guns a couple times </v>

1697
01:14:14.271 --> 01:14:15.580
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he did a show recently in New Mexico</v>

1698
01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and a bunch of people wanted their money</v>
<v Speaker 1>back because he got on stage,</v>

1699
01:14:18.601 --> 01:14:19.870
<v Speaker 1>it shows a 9:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

1700
01:14:19.871 --> 01:14:23.380
<v Speaker 1>He didn't get on stage to like midnight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes on stage,</v>

1701
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:27.010
<v Speaker 1>the music stays on while he's on stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we use it stays on and he's,</v>

1702
01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:32.100
<v Speaker 1>he takes his shirt off and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing and he's dancing around with a </v>

1703
01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he starts doing pushups and then he</v>

1704
01:14:32.711 --> 01:14:35.710
<v Speaker 1>starts talking to pushups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing pushups on stage with no shirt on.</v>

1705
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.720
<v Speaker 1>And then he starts talking to people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the audience.</v>

1706
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So either he's just like trying to come </v>
<v Speaker 1>up with some new material and just going</v>

1707
01:14:43.210 --> 01:14:46.810
<v Speaker 1>deep into the crazy ben or he's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimately losing his mind.</v>

1708
01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said it before,</v>

1709
01:14:49.751 --> 01:14:51.340
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've said it so many times.</v>

1710
01:14:51.341 --> 01:14:56.341
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of brilliant people that </v>

1711
01:14:56.341 --> 01:14:58.651
<v Speaker 1>are very close to insanity and I know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been close to and Saturday </v>

<v Speaker 1>I just have to wait for that storm to </v>

1716
01:15:10.021 --> 01:15:10.021
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>

1719
01:15:11.531 --> 01:15:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1720
01:15:13.290 --> 01:15:18.290
<v Speaker 6>I feel it at times.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel it when I get home writing out </v>

1721
01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:24.630
<v Speaker 6>your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've got to force myself out of the </v>

1722
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:27.210
<v Speaker 6>fucking house because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why you go to into your head.</v>

1723
01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:28.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1724
01:15:29.010 --> 01:15:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be alone with your </v>

1725
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.010
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.</v>

1726
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.410
<v Speaker 1>There's moments where you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with other people just to get a</v>

1727
01:15:34.411 --> 01:15:35.520
<v Speaker 1>sense of normalcy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1728
01:15:36.250 --> 01:15:41.250
<v Speaker 6>When you add them to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes you're writing and you get </v>

1729
01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:44.811
<v Speaker 6>into it and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're there and all of a sudden you </v>

<v Speaker 6>hasn't been in with standups.</v>

1732
01:15:48.331 --> 01:15:50.040
<v Speaker 6>I could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel myself slipping.</v>

1733
01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:55.300
<v Speaker 6>I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I felt myself slipping a lot with the </v>

1734
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:57.141
<v Speaker 6>cope when I was on stage when I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>talking to myself and I caught myself </v>

1735
01:15:57.141 --> 01:15:58.680
<v Speaker 6>with four to eight and that would catch </v>
<v Speaker 6>myself at eight.</v>

1736
01:15:58.710 --> 01:16:03.710
<v Speaker 6>Wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was just at four a fuck that I get to </v>

1737
01:16:03.710 --> 01:16:04.230
<v Speaker 6>eight when I was talking about earlier </v>
<v Speaker 6>about Roger Waters.</v>

1738
01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Roger waters the article in rolling </v>
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>

1739
01:16:06.490 --> 01:16:08.440
<v Speaker 1>One of the things he was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>his childhood,</v>

1740
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:12.310
<v Speaker 1>his dad was in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad died when he was really young and</v>

<v Speaker 1>all of sudden his dad's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole,</v>

1744

<v Speaker 1>that void.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1745
01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:21.670
<v Speaker 1>there's something about loss and </v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

1746
01:16:21.700 --> 01:16:22.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>

1747
01:16:22.301 --> 01:16:24.550
<v Speaker 1>when you're young and fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happens.</v>

1748
01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:28.330
<v Speaker 1>That creates like seemingly the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant people the most,</v>

1749
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but they're also the most likely to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something fucking crazy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>stage and for 45 fucking minutes it </v>

1753
01:16:42.691 --> 01:16:46.180
<v Speaker 1>tells one joke and then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a test of wills,</v>

1754
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:48.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna say nothing.</v>

1755
01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:50.800
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That Nita and like stays up there for 45</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just want to be entertained.</v>

1758
01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:57.580
<v Speaker 1>We tell some jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

1759
01:16:57.581 --> 01:16:58.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:05.390

<v Speaker 1>Like meanwhile he was just standing on </v>

1762
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:06.550
<v Speaker 1>stage like saying nothing for 45 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

1763
01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a lot of hearsay to,</v>

1764
01:17:08.531 --> 01:17:10.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the exact story of what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

1765
01:17:10.641 --> 01:17:12.530
<v Speaker 1>but this is what I keep hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was a,</v>

1766
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:17.531
<v Speaker 1>another video of him going on stage at </v>
<v Speaker 1>some festival and he bombed there too </v>

1767
01:17:17.531 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 1>and he was doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just standing on stage with no,</v>

1768
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:22.560
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1769
01:17:22.561 --> 01:17:23.890
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not this.</v>

1770
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:26.370
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing anything gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just standing on stage.</v>

1771
01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:32.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what happens to Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the comedians life and I could sit here </v>

1772
01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:38.740
<v Speaker 6>in the next 20 minutes and give you a </v>
<v Speaker 6>list of them that they think that they </v>

1773
01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:42.861
<v Speaker 6>go from becoming comedians to thinking </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I listen to what the fuck they're </v>

1774
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:42.861
<v Speaker 6>saying.</v>

1775
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1776
01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:47.800
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to his reading his </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts.</v>

1777
01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.870
<v Speaker 1>He was getting tax was on stage on </v>
<v Speaker 1>reading though.</v>

1778
01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:54.040
<v Speaker 1>He has this whole new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>style of comedy that he's doing.</v>

1779
01:17:54.041 --> 01:17:55.780
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it twice.</v>

1780
01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:00.400
<v Speaker 1>My friend Demar seen it four times or </v>
<v Speaker 1>three times and what it is,</v>

1781
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:05.410
<v Speaker 1>it looks very organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he starts off and he automatically </v>

1782
01:18:05.410 --> 01:18:06.430
<v Speaker 1>starts going and we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what he's doing.</v>

1783
01:18:07.170 --> 01:18:12.040
<v Speaker 1>He was doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was not what they need to show.</v>

1784
01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:15.370
<v Speaker 1>What they're saying is he's not doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything but you're standing on stage.</v>

1785
01:18:15.371 --> 01:18:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Not Saying a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1786
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:19.650
<v Speaker 1>He said he was talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't just sitting there ninth St.</v>

1787
01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Jude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It this latest show that I am talking to</v>

1788
01:18:21.881 --> 01:18:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking to show that you saw.</v>

1789
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:26.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying the show that he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently.</v>

1790
01:18:26.610 --> 01:18:30.220
<v Speaker 1>He got on stage and he was talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it was a battle of wills.</v>

1791
01:18:30.221 --> 01:18:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna say nothing and we'll see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how long we.</v>

1792
01:18:31.991 --> 01:18:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Last year he was gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was being quiet and he wanted them to</v>

1793
01:18:34.691 --> 01:18:39.691
<v Speaker 1>be quiet until.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see who breaks first he said </v>

1794
01:18:39.691 --> 01:18:39.691
<v Speaker 1>nothing and people were losing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind like he.</v>

1795
01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:43.780
<v Speaker 1>He told one joke and then the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the set he sat around and did nothing.</v>

1796
01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:50.040
<v Speaker 6>He.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a point with these fucking </v>

1797
01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:50.040
<v Speaker 6>comedians that they think that they go </v>
<v Speaker 6>from being a comic.</v>

1798
01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:54.811
<v Speaker 6>The social commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they did something to that I </v>

1799
01:18:54.811 --> 01:18:55.420
<v Speaker 6>deserved this social commentary and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what's really going on.</v>

1800
01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:58.420
<v Speaker 6>We've seen it with Eddie Griffin.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We see it with this fucking guy.</v>

1801
01:18:58.421 --> 01:19:02.610

<v Speaker 6>I see that I put on that button,</v>

1802

<v Speaker 6>shut your mouth and just do the fucking </v>

1825

<v Speaker 6>jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bro.</v>

1826
01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:16.100
<v Speaker 6>That's my big problem lately.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nobody wants to shut that fucking mouth </v>

<v Speaker 6>either.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do the jokes to shut the fucking map.</v>

1828
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:21.470
<v Speaker 6>What is all this chitter chatter about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Stupidity for that day in that green </v>

1829
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.720
<v Speaker 6>room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to watch stand hope.</v>

1830
01:20:21.721 --> 01:20:24.030
<v Speaker 6>One of the most brilliant comments,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a dear friend of mine,</v>

1831
01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.720
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Janeane Garofalo saying that the guy and</v>

1832
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:33.070
<v Speaker 6>in Tucson that killed the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that tried to kill the congressman was </v>

1833
01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:35.640
<v Speaker 6>pushed to kill him because social media </v>
<v Speaker 6>force them.</v>

1834
01:20:35.850 --> 01:20:37.650
<v Speaker 6>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when she said that,</v>

1835
01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:39.870
<v Speaker 6>that's not what a comedian worries is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She really says that.</v>

1836
01:20:39.871 --> 01:20:44.871
<v Speaker 6>What a career.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A real comedian doesn't worry about </v>

1837
01:20:44.871 --> 01:20:48.171
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's somebody who wants you to think </v>

1838
01:20:48.171 --> 01:20:48.171
<v Speaker 6>that they care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like me,</v>

1839
01:20:48.171 --> 01:20:50.930
<v Speaker 6>because I do care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't care that it's fake tattoos.</v>

1840
01:20:50.940 --> 01:20:53.240
<v Speaker 6>You got to fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

1841
01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:55.350
<v Speaker 6>That's what they care about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what we're talking about.</v>

1842
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:57.180
<v Speaker 6>Whether it's a fad or whatever the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

1843
01:20:57.210 --> 01:20:59.520
<v Speaker 6>I can't deal with it no more want me to </v>
<v Speaker 6>make me feel,</v>

1844
01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:00.960
<v Speaker 6>make me funny,</v>
<v Speaker 6>make me laugh.</v>

1845
01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:05.640
<v Speaker 6>I would refuse to go on stage and give </v>
<v Speaker 6>you my opinion of the White House,</v>

1846
01:21:05.641 --> 01:21:07.300
<v Speaker 6>so the tea party,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because at the end of the week,</v>

1847
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:09.960
<v Speaker 6>nomadic guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I paid to watch you do jokes.</v>

1848
01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:11.880
<v Speaker 6>I want you to take me through your </v>
<v Speaker 6>world,</v>

1849
01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:17.660
<v Speaker 6>but that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to hear no social </v>

1850
01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:17.660
<v Speaker 6>commentary and we've seen it from a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>of comedians,</v>

1851
01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:18.420
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After a 55 minute mark,</v>

1852
01:21:18.421 --> 01:21:21.390
<v Speaker 6>I think I got to listen to this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do your 55 minutes.</v>

1853
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also,</v>

1854
01:21:22.221 --> 01:21:26.320
<v Speaker 1>they've developed a following of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who hang on every word and you know,</v>

1855
01:21:26.330 --> 01:21:31.330
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of them that think they </v>
<v Speaker 1>have something brilliant to say and so </v>

1856
01:21:31.330 --> 01:21:31.580
<v Speaker 1>they choose the venue of standup comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>

1857
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:33.690
<v Speaker 1>this fucking podcast is a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of the.</v>

1858
01:21:33.691 --> 01:21:34.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times people have something to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

1859
01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:36.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting,</v>

1860
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:40.980
<v Speaker 1>but this is the right venue for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A podcast is the right venue for us.</v>

1861
01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.820
<v Speaker 1>This is not what I would ever do on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage when I do,</v>

1862
01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:48.880
<v Speaker 1>when I do my set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a fucking set I'll fuck around a </v>

1863
01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:48.880
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm trying to be funny period period</v>

1864
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.470
<v Speaker 1>and that's because people used to always</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that like comedy should be used in</v>

1865
01:21:54.471 --> 01:21:59.471
<v Speaker 1>some way to like educate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educate people in the light and people </v>

1866
01:21:59.471 --> 01:22:02.471
<v Speaker 1>and then it's important to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And almost to the point of sacrificing </v>

1867
01:22:02.471 --> 01:22:02.471
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1868
01:22:02.471 --> 01:22:06.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Hicks had some material that was </v>

1869
01:22:06.611 --> 01:22:06.611
<v Speaker 1>like that where it was not funny at all.</v>

1870
01:22:06.611 --> 01:22:06.670
<v Speaker 6>At the end.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bill his wasn't funny.</v>

1871
01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:09.940
<v Speaker 6>Let's get out of the way at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Lance Williams garbage.</v>

1872
01:22:10.090 --> 01:22:11.890
<v Speaker 6>Listen to the live from the village </v>
<v Speaker 6>gate.</v>

1873
01:22:12.040 --> 01:22:17.040
<v Speaker 6>That's almost.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could even hear the people like </v>

1874
01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:17.170
<v Speaker 6>ready to laugh and was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh God.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well some of his stuff like he.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1876
01:22:19.031 --> 01:22:24.031

<v Speaker 1>village gate one was earlier and what </v>

1877
01:22:24.031 --> 01:22:27.481
<v Speaker 1>that was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did the bid on abortion and this is </v>

1878
01:22:27.481 --> 01:22:27.481
<v Speaker 1>what I'm talking about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

1879
01:22:27.481 --> 01:22:27.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you don't want people to abortion.</v>

1880
01:22:28.090 --> 01:22:31.780
<v Speaker 1>Then you fucking raise them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking raise them.</v>

1881

<v Speaker 1>You fucking raised the kids and there is</v>

1882
01:22:34.391 --> 01:22:35.950

<v Speaker 1>This is a mess.</v>

1884
01:22:37.451 --> 01:22:39.080
<v Speaker 1>This is a comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

1887
01:22:43.571 --> 01:22:48.571
<v Speaker 1>I see your point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't want people to have </v>

1888
01:22:48.571 --> 01:22:48.571
<v Speaker 1>abortions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should raise their children.</v>

1889
01:22:48.571 --> 01:22:49.170
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying that you should</v>
<v Speaker 1>get involved.</v>

1890
01:22:49.190 --> 01:22:52.510
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're not being funny period.</v>

1891
01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:53.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not a joke.</v>

1892
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:56.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a thing that happens to a lot</v>

1893
01:22:56.081 --> 01:22:57.520
<v Speaker 1>of comics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's they,</v>

1894
01:22:57.550 --> 01:23:01.240
<v Speaker 1>they start to get people who want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to them.</v>

1895
01:23:01.390 --> 01:23:04.240
<v Speaker 1>They start to get people who think </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're deep and they start listening to</v>

1896
01:23:04.241 --> 01:23:09.241
<v Speaker 1>those people and they do this at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy club and they up at a comedy </v>

1897

<v Speaker 1>club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen it happen.</v>

1898
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:14.910
<v Speaker 1>We've seen it happen in so many titles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought there was this fucking kid </v>

1899
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:14.910
<v Speaker 1>from Jimmy's comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allah.</v>

1900
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:15.130
<v Speaker 1>God Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget his name,</v>

1901
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.290
<v Speaker 1>but he's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really funny.</v>

1902
01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:20.230
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really funny and this was like in</v>

1903
01:23:20.231 --> 01:23:22.870
<v Speaker 1>the the late eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early nineties,</v>

1904
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:26.650
<v Speaker 1>and he came to Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drove to La and it was working at the</v>

1905
01:23:26.651 --> 01:23:28.930
<v Speaker 1>comedy store for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the kid?</v>

1906
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Kind of good looking guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but overweight.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It drives me nuts,</v>

1908
01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.710
<v Speaker 1>but he was a perfect example of that.</v>

1909
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.510
<v Speaker 1>He would go on stage at the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>store.</v>

1910
01:23:37.511 --> 01:23:39.880
<v Speaker 1>They fucking tortured him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tortured him.</v>

1911
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Can you go onstage and try to be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep and meaningful when he was funny,</v>

1912
01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:46.510
<v Speaker 1>he can be really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you had some good bits.</v>

<v Speaker 1>some good bits.</v>

1921

<v Speaker 4>This is a portrait of my Italian family.</v>

1929
01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:41.130
<v Speaker 4>He was leaning for folks at home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had put his hands up like someone's </v>

1930
01:24:41.130 --> 01:24:44.941
<v Speaker 4>trying to take his picture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes like I was telling </v>

<v Speaker 4>My name is Charlie Hill.</v>

01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:37.970
<v Speaker 5>Pittsburgh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pittsburgh was fucking awesome data.</v>

2209
01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:40.340
<v Speaker 5>That library.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It used to be a library.</v>

2210
01:36:40.730 --> 01:36:45.730
<v Speaker 5>Fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Carnegie Library Music called fucking </v>

2211
01:36:45.730 --> 01:36:46.070
<v Speaker 5>place was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pittsburgh is great.</v>

2212
01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:51.480
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things we were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the most underrated fucking </v>

2213
01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:54.071
<v Speaker 5>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We didn't like it when we did that </v>

2214
01:36:54.071 --> 01:36:54.071
<v Speaker 5>Improv.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't go with you that time.</v>

2215
01:36:54.071 --> 01:36:55.040

01:36:55.041 --> 01:37:00.041
<v Speaker 5>It was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the Chinese food as well when we </v>

2217
01:37:00.041 --> 01:37:02.261
<v Speaker 5>were there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The one of the reasons why we didn't </v>

2218
01:37:02.261 --> 01:37:03.701
<v Speaker 5>like it is because there was apparently </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was some fucking sports thing </v>

2219
01:37:03.701 --> 01:37:03.701
<v Speaker 5>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some did.</v>

2220
01:37:03.701 --> 01:37:08.610
<v Speaker 5>They're a really loyal to their teams </v>
<v Speaker 5>and when you got like a big game going </v>

2221
01:37:08.610 --> 01:37:09.410
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nobody wants to go to see nothing.</v>

2222
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:14.590
<v Speaker 5>And even people that bought tickets </v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't come to the show because it was </v>

2223
01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:18.161
<v Speaker 5>some big sports game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some football game or I don't know what </v>

2263
01:38:44.690 --> 01:38:45.991
<v Speaker 3>you think is ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hash is actually a resin resident </v>

2264
01:38:45.991 --> 01:38:48.590
<v Speaker 3>residents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways they make it as resident</v>

2265
01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:53.600
<v Speaker 3>that's not hash rehashes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a process to make cash that </v>

2266
01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.040
<v Speaker 3>doesn't involve burning it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Resident is when you scrape a pipe,</v>

2267
01:38:56.190 --> 01:39:00.000
<v Speaker 3>that's what resonance Hash Resin is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different process.</v>

2268
01:39:00.001 --> 01:39:03.510
<v Speaker 3>It's not the resident of smoking been </v>
<v Speaker 3>multiple ways to make it,</v>

2269
01:39:03.511 --> 01:39:06.930
<v Speaker 3>but one of the ways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of that ways to make hash is rising.</v>

2270
01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:10.000
<v Speaker 3>One of the ways to make cassius scraping</v>
<v Speaker 3>residence.</v>

2271
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:15.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neither one of us know enough about how </v>

2272
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:17.180
<v Speaker 3>to make have to assess and shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>they?</v>

2273
01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:22.480
<v Speaker 3>They take the thc as some somebody </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're pretending that you don't like </v>

2274

<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

2276
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:28.710
<v Speaker 3>Also Syria as an example of me staying </v>
<v Speaker 3>on just saying,</v>

2277
01:39:28.711 --> 01:39:30.090
<v Speaker 3>you're just upset because you love this </v>
<v Speaker 3>girl,</v>

2278
01:39:30.091 --> 01:39:30.750
<v Speaker 3>and I said she might be.</v>

2279
01:39:30.930 --> 01:39:35.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'm just saying in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every time I say something you get </v>

2280
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.930
<v Speaker 3>really angry at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really angry.</v>

2281
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:37.640
<v Speaker 3>You just noticed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I noticed it,</v>

2282
01:39:37.660 --> 01:39:39.360
<v Speaker 3>I noticed that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2283
01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:42.780
<v Speaker 3>I noticed you say ridiculous shit all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time and I,</v>

2284
01:39:42.790 --> 01:39:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I clown you for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it doesn't mean that I'm really </v>

2285
01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:47.790
<v Speaker 3>angry at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2286
01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:47.790
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2287
01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:48.660
<v Speaker 3>But why does it every time I say </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2288
01:39:48.661 --> 01:39:51.990
<v Speaker 3>you always have to completely shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was barely bashing your girl.</v>

2289
01:39:51.991 --> 01:39:56.991
<v Speaker 3>Pissed all over you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said she had an orgasm and she's </v>

2290
01:39:56.991 --> 01:40:01.461
<v Speaker 3>never done this before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she had the same time and she was </v>

2291
01:40:01.461 --> 01:40:01.461
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

2292
01:40:01.461 --> 01:40:02.220
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that it's appropriate to</v>

2293
01:40:02.221 --> 01:40:04.510
<v Speaker 3>say you might be dating retarded girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a joke.</v>

2294
01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:05.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>

2295
01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2296
01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.280
<v Speaker 3>I liked her girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's a nice person.</v>

2297
01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:14.600
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're following the same thing that's </v>

2298
01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:14.600
<v Speaker 3>wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

2299
01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:17.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's your girlfriend about this shit </v>

2300
01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:17.720
<v Speaker 3>unless you tend to follow what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

2301
01:40:17.730 --> 01:40:18.840
<v Speaker 3>Nothing wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Brian,</v>

2302
01:40:18.841 --> 01:40:23.841
<v Speaker 3>you can't get the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason why I do this because in the </v>

2303
01:40:23.841 --> 01:40:28.310
<v Speaker 3>past we've talked about where girls are </v>
<v Speaker 3>really juicy and we spray that,</v>

2304
01:40:28.311 --> 01:40:30.210
<v Speaker 3>that it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it p or not?</v>

2305
01:40:30.600 --> 01:40:31.440
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2306
01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:36.450
<v Speaker 3>I actually said no it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just know girls that have done that </v>

2307
01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:36.450
<v Speaker 3>before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when she did it,</v>

2308
01:40:36.450 --> 01:40:37.580
<v Speaker 3>it felt like she was coming like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2309
01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.600
<v Speaker 3>like I've had experienced before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when I smelled it it was 100 </v>

2310
01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:45.921
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with other girls at squirted it </v>

2311
01:40:45.921 --> 01:40:46.200
<v Speaker 3>smelled different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this time you smelled it,</v>

2312
01:40:46.750 --> 01:40:48.450
<v Speaker 3>smelled it because it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2313
01:40:48.451 --> 01:40:53.451
<v Speaker 3>why is it all over my asparagus now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is there anything else that definitely </v>

2314
01:40:53.741 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 3>makes you</v>

2315
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:55.360
<v Speaker 1>pee?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Smell pineapples,</v>

2316
01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:58.540
<v Speaker 1>pineapples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it smell good or taste good.</v>

2317
01:40:58.541 --> 01:41:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Your loads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pineapples.</v>

2318
01:41:00.140 --> 01:41:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I supposed to make your loads tastes </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

2319
01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:04.830
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But pee smell a pea.</v>

2320
01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.070
<v Speaker 1>It's always asparagus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2321
01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:07.990
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you thought of,</v>

2322
01:41:08.170 --> 01:41:09.430
<v Speaker 1>like if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes you a piece?</v>

2323
01:41:09.431 --> 01:41:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Think you'd say parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asparagus.</v>

2324
01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:12.960
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2325
01:41:13.210 --> 01:41:16.380
<v Speaker 2>And see vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C,</v>

2326
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:18.960
<v Speaker 2>that's when it makes it bright orange </v>
<v Speaker 2>and bright orange.</v>

2327
01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all vitamins make your pee bright.</v>

2328
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it is the vitamin C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin C,</v>

2329
01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:28.000
<v Speaker 1>is it the more you're dehydrated yellow </v>
<v Speaker 1>your pis gets yes.</v>

2330
01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Or if you have a lot of vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a lot of vitamins,</v>

2331
01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.590
<v Speaker 1>that's why people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2332
01:41:32.591 --> 01:41:34.270
<v Speaker 1>well you took vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which comes out in your pee.</v>

2333
01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:39.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of it does come on your p and it </v>

2334
01:41:39.450 --> 01:41:41.260
<v Speaker 1>makes you appear different color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of it affects your body in a </v>

2335
01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:43.891
<v Speaker 1>positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the weakest arguments </v>

2336
01:41:43.891 --> 01:41:43.891
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you shouldn't take vitamins.</v>

2337
01:41:43.891 --> 01:41:47.461
<v Speaker 1>Just pm out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard people say that so many </v>

2338
01:41:47.461 --> 01:41:47.461
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

2339
01:41:47.461 --> 01:41:50.670
<v Speaker 1>Are you really going into every cell and</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring how your nutrients are </v>

2340
01:41:50.670 --> 01:41:52.510
<v Speaker 1>distributed and you know for sure it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out in your urine.</v>

2341
01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:53.860
<v Speaker 1>You Lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

2342
01:41:53.861 --> 01:41:55.780
<v Speaker 1>you're so lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't even take vitamins.</v>

2343
01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:57.970
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to so many people like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>

2344
01:41:57.971 --> 01:42:02.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to take vitamins or just can't </v>

2345
01:42:02.971 --> 01:42:04.381
<v Speaker 1>be bothered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't be bothered to stick a </v>

2346
01:42:04.381 --> 01:42:04.381
<v Speaker 1>pill in your mouth and drink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How hard is it?</v>

2347
01:42:04.381 --> 01:42:06.400
<v Speaker 1>You're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating all this food.</v>

2348
01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:11.460
<v Speaker 1>How hard is it to remember to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in your mouth and drink and </v>

2349
01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:14.131
<v Speaker 1>then you're healthier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get nutrients that you're not </v>

2350
01:42:14.131 --> 01:42:14.131
<v Speaker 1>getting from your diet.</v>

2351
01:42:14.131 --> 01:42:14.330
<v Speaker 2>Things that I do like that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I'm like,</v>

2352
01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:16.400
<v Speaker 2>that's so dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That entity like floss,</v>

2353
01:42:16.401 --> 01:42:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I should like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hate flossing the debt,</v>

2354
01:42:18.750 --> 01:42:20.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes what,</v>

2355
01:42:20.091 --> 01:42:22.430
<v Speaker 2>two minutes and floss your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't do it.</v>

2356
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Like my body won't let me floss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2357
01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:26.590
<v Speaker 2>I tried out for a couple of days and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then I,</v>

2358
01:42:26.591 --> 01:42:27.590
<v Speaker 2>I just hate it.</v>

2359
01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I think we're programmed in a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>way by the way we were raised and </v>

2360
01:42:32.670 --> 01:42:36.481
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of shit that people got on</v>
<v Speaker 1>you when you were a little kid that you </v>

2361
01:42:36.481 --> 01:42:39.451
<v Speaker 1>still to this day don't want to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>do because your parents told you to do </v>

2362
01:42:39.451 --> 01:42:40.240
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have this problem with work,</v>

2363
01:42:40.241 --> 01:42:42.970
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like doing things that are work,</v>

2364
01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:48.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind doing things that are for </v>

2365
01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:48.060
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I could work forever on.</v>

2366
01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can train,</v>

2367

<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

2368
01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.940

2369
01:42:51.941 --> 01:42:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I can draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can work forever on things that I want</v>

2370
01:42:54.791 --> 01:42:59.791
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if someone tells me I'm supposed to </v>

2371
01:42:59.791 --> 01:42:59.791
<v Speaker 1>do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time.</v>

2372
01:42:59.791 --> 01:43:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time showing up for things</v>
<v Speaker 1>on time.</v>

2373
01:43:00.821 --> 01:43:05.821
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like part of me that wants to </v>

2374
01:43:05.821 --> 01:43:08.311
<v Speaker 1>resist being on time and part of me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to resist doing work and I know </v>

2375
01:43:08.311 --> 01:43:09.580
<v Speaker 1>it's from growing up.</v>

2376
01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.620
<v Speaker 1>It's from growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being forced to work,</v>

2377
01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:13.090
<v Speaker 1>growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being forced to,</v>

2378
01:43:13.290 --> 01:43:18.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to say that the thought of your </v>

2379
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:20.360
<v Speaker 1>work is dreariness and going to work is </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be miserable and you're </v>

2380
01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:24.700
<v Speaker 1>gonna have to contain your emotions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>contain your disdain for what you're </v>

2381
01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:25.180
<v Speaker 1>doing and just force yourself to follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

2382
01:43:25.690 --> 01:43:28.270
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a lot of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like shit,</v>

2383
01:43:28.271 --> 01:43:30.670
<v Speaker 1>like brushing your teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brushing teeth is great,</v>

2384
01:43:30.730 --> 01:43:32.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're a little kid,</v>

2385
01:43:32.411 --> 01:43:37.411
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody told you to brush your teeth </v>

2386

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to sleep with fucking </v>

<v Speaker 1>hanging out with you is that there's a </v>

2411
01:44:29.291 --> 01:44:32.861
<v Speaker 1>lot of people think there's rules to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way you're supposed to behave and live </v>

2412
01:44:32.861 --> 01:44:32.861
<v Speaker 1>and think.</v>

2413
01:44:32.861 --> 01:44:33.670
<v Speaker 1>And then you meet somebody and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2414
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:35.290
<v Speaker 1>this guy's not following any rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say,</v>

2415
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go follow him for a minute.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Why are you doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

2419
01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:42.920
<v Speaker 1>he just pulled you dig out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sure you're going to go to jail?</v>

2420
01:44:42.921 --> 01:44:46.190
<v Speaker 1>You see you smoking pot out in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some people that,</v>

2421
01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:47.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I grew up,</v>

2422
01:44:47.421 --> 01:44:52.421
<v Speaker 1>I grew up very disciplined because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a martial arts competitor and my from </v>

2423
01:44:52.421 --> 01:44:55.760
<v Speaker 1>age 15 to 21 my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life was very,</v>

2424
01:44:55.761 --> 01:44:57.500
<v Speaker 1>very disciplined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't drink,</v>

2425
01:44:57.650 --> 01:44:59.420
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate healthy foods.</v>

2426
01:44:59.421 --> 01:45:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I trained all the time and the reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>why I didn't drink a very rarely I might</v>

2427
01:45:03.231 --> 01:45:07.400
<v Speaker 1>have smoked pot five times in my whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>life from the time I was like,</v>

2428
01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 till the time I was like 21,</v>

2429
01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:11.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe six at the most.</v>

2430
01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I might've got drunk three or four times</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was always worried about going</v>

2431
01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:18.410
<v Speaker 1>to the gym the next day and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>

2432
01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I was always worried like if I got drunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then four weeks from now I have a </v>

2433
01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:27.401
<v Speaker 1>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would if I get my ass kicked in a fight </v>

2434
01:45:27.401 --> 01:45:27.830
<v Speaker 1>that I would have won,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't get drunk on that one day,</v>

2435
01:45:27.831 --> 01:45:32.831
<v Speaker 1>I would so I would think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was super disciplined and then I </v>

2436
01:45:32.831 --> 01:45:35.501
<v Speaker 1>met my friend Johnny B and my met my </v>

<v Speaker 1>to being a comedian.</v>

2438

<v Speaker 1>shift in the human beings and that was </v>

01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:37.770
<v Speaker 1>Fucking going on the road with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>

2502
01:48:37.771 --> 01:48:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Just fucking living off a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>advances.</v>

2503
01:48:40.711 --> 01:48:42.420
<v Speaker 1>And just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

2504
01:48:42.480 --> 01:48:47.480
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing comedy back then and he </v>

2505
01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:47.480
<v Speaker 1>wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You weren't good you,</v>

2506
01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:49.380
<v Speaker 1>you were a different comedian man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2507
01:48:49.381 --> 01:48:54.381
<v Speaker 1>and I always say that there's never a </v>
<v Speaker 1>person that I've ever seen make the </v>

2508
01:48:54.381 --> 01:48:57.210
<v Speaker 1>switch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flipped the switch and go from a guy who</v>

2509
01:48:57.270 --> 01:49:00.960
<v Speaker 1>wasn't doing well on stage to a guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just destroyed,</v>

2510
01:49:00.970 --> 01:49:02.730
<v Speaker 1>lost my inhibitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost,</v>

2511
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was amazing.</v>

2512
01:49:03.910 --> 01:49:08.910
<v Speaker 1>It was because one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was holding me down was going on my </v>

2513
01:49:08.910 --> 01:49:11.901
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really holding me down and who I </v>

2514
01:49:11.901 --> 01:49:11.901
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt.</v>

2515
01:49:11.901 --> 01:49:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I kept thinking I was doing the role of </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

2516
01:49:13.020 --> 01:49:18.020
<v Speaker 1>so until I committed to doing comedy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a broke fucking comic the way you </v>

2517
01:49:18.181 --> 01:49:20.790
<v Speaker 1>supposed to commit yourself to anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>you dive into,</v>

2518
01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be good because I kept </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of a time I was to back to </v>

2519
01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Colorado will be a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I kept thinking.</v>

2520
01:49:27.871 --> 01:49:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't be doing this shit.</v>

2521
01:49:29.341 --> 01:49:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>

2522
01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:33.480
<v Speaker 1>but this is what was pulling me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had nothing there with my daughter.</v>

2523
01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to raise my daughter my way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew how I was going to raise a </v>

2524
01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:38.780
<v Speaker 1>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to raise a daughter that she</v>

2525
01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:39.990
<v Speaker 1>didn't grow up like these fucking dumb </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

2526
01:49:39.991 --> 01:49:42.990
<v Speaker 1>You see that have dignity and they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking respect the same way.</v>

2527
01:49:42.991 --> 01:49:47.991
<v Speaker 1>My mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I don't do what other people </v>

2528
01:49:47.991 --> 01:49:47.991
<v Speaker 1>do a beat of the drum because that's how</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother raised me dog</v>

2529
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:51.640
<v Speaker 6>to beat my own fucking drum if you don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>like something,</v>

2530
01:49:51.641 --> 01:49:54.730
<v Speaker 6>say it and how that wasn't a raise my </v>
<v Speaker 6>daughter and.</v>

2531
01:49:54.760 --> 01:49:59.760
<v Speaker 6>But the whole time I thought I was going</v>
<v Speaker 6>to come to la and anytime I want to go </v>

2532
01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:00.310
<v Speaker 6>back and get an apartment of boulders.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't committed.</v>

2533
01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:04.480
<v Speaker 6>One day I fucking got a thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 6>wanted to change her name and the mother</v>

2534
01:50:04.481 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 6>correlate with some bullshit story and </v>
<v Speaker 6>this and I had to be this nice person.</v>

2535
01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:10.810
<v Speaker 6>I don't like being nice if I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 6>to bro.</v>

2536
01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:13.660
<v Speaker 6>That's why I've changed so much.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially after the blow.</v>

2537
01:50:13.661 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't take nothing from nobody now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

2538
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:18.910
<v Speaker 6>You can't get away with nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

2539
01:50:18.911 --> 01:50:21.610
<v Speaker 6>So will you're saying is because I left </v>
<v Speaker 6>my inhibitions.</v>

2540
01:50:21.611 --> 01:50:24.840
<v Speaker 6>Go to be a good community you to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't committed to it.</v>

2541
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:26.680
<v Speaker 6>That's what it really was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fuck the inhibitions.</v>

2542
01:50:26.890 --> 01:50:29.290
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't committed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I thought I wanted to be a dad.</v>

2543
01:50:29.291 --> 01:50:31.600
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to be a dad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wanted to be a dad,</v>

2544
01:50:31.810 --> 01:50:33.460
<v Speaker 6>but they weren't opening up the door for</v>
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

2545
01:50:33.461 --> 01:50:35.880
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't run that shit if I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 6>like.</v>

2546
01:50:35.881 --> 01:50:39.910
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is where it all goes to right now.</v>

2547
01:50:39.911 --> 01:50:42.280
<v Speaker 6>We're going to straighten this out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This thing that happened in Denver,</v>

2548
01:50:42.610 --> 01:50:44.620
<v Speaker 6>she threw me out because a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 6>have been tweeting me.</v>

2549
01:50:44.621 --> 01:50:46.930
<v Speaker 6>What happened for sexual harassment?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you talking about?</v>

2550
01:50:46.931 --> 01:50:49.130
<v Speaker 6>The thing with the club,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the comedy works comedy.</v>

2551
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:54.630
<v Speaker 6>There's a lot of people because most </v>
<v Speaker 6>people have no idea what you're talking </v>

2552
01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:54.630
<v Speaker 6>about because last week got a couple </v>
<v Speaker 6>people asked me what Joey did.</v>

01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:54.870
<v Speaker 6>Here's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll fill you in.</v>

2554
01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:59.900
<v Speaker 6>Joy Diaz has never been able to work </v>
<v Speaker 6>with me at the comedy works in Denver </v>

2555
01:50:59.900 --> 01:50:59.900
<v Speaker 6>and people always ask,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when is Joey Diaz?</v>

2556
01:50:59.900 --> 01:51:04.590
<v Speaker 6>Colin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why can't you bring Joey Diaz at the </v>

2557
01:51:04.590 --> 01:51:04.590
<v Speaker 6>comedy works?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has never been allowed to do that.</v>

2558
01:51:04.590 --> 01:51:06.540
<v Speaker 6>Ever since I've been performing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So she told a bunch of.</v>

2559
01:51:06.541 --> 01:51:08.470
<v Speaker 6>It was the woman who owns the club.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2560
01:51:08.471 --> 01:51:11.680
<v Speaker 6>And it would have happened with some </v>
<v Speaker 6>girl ran down and jumped and when I went</v>

2561
01:51:11.681 --> 01:51:16.681
<v Speaker 6>to grab her I grabbed her ass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a kid there that was like in </v>

2562
01:51:16.681 --> 01:51:20.101
<v Speaker 6>the same league as me.</v>

2563
01:51:20.101 --> 01:51:20.560
<v Speaker 6>was kind of weird about star spots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what they call them.</v>

2564
01:51:20.561 --> 01:51:22.540
<v Speaker 6>Guest spots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Comedy works in those days.</v>

2565
01:51:22.541 --> 01:51:25.180
<v Speaker 6>That's when you did Thursday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were good enough to do Thursday,</v>

2566
01:51:25.190 --> 01:51:27.340
<v Speaker 6>Wednesday and Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we do like 10 minutes,</v>

2567
01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:28.720
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ten minutes and you get off.</v>

2568
01:51:28.721 --> 01:51:31.180
<v Speaker 6>And Wendy liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wendy likes Italian guys,</v>

2569

<v Speaker 6>you know who she likes to?</v>
<v Speaker 6>East Coast and she like rocky whatever </v>

01:51:36.181 --> 01:51:36.530
<v Speaker 6>She likes those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2572
01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:39.490
<v Speaker 6>So she kinda liked me and this guy kept </v>
<v Speaker 6>seeing it.</v>

2573
01:51:39.491 --> 01:51:44.491
<v Speaker 6>And one day I hear that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm supposed to open up with George </v>

2574
01:51:44.491 --> 01:51:44.491
<v Speaker 6>Lopez.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got a call from Wendy.</v>

2575
01:51:44.491 --> 01:51:46.810
<v Speaker 6>I did sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sexual harassment as well.</v>

2576
01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:49.300
<v Speaker 6>The girl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what girl came in here.</v>

2577
01:51:49.301 --> 01:51:54.301
<v Speaker 6>So I got the whole story,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but a bunch of comics had seen the girl </v>

2578
01:51:54.301 --> 01:51:55.740
<v Speaker 6>jump into me and me grab arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We were partying.</v>

2579
01:51:55.750 --> 01:52:00.750
<v Speaker 6>It's like be us being at the store and </v>
<v Speaker 6>Katie can you and running to you and </v>

2580
01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:01.900
<v Speaker 6>when she jumps at you grab it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2581
01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:03.610
<v Speaker 6>So the girl didn't say nothing that </v>
<v Speaker 6>night.</v>

2582
01:52:03.670 --> 01:52:08.670
<v Speaker 6>She didn't say nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We kept drinking and we did a couple of </v>

2583
01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:10.951
<v Speaker 6>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Three days later she was silent with </v>

2584
01:52:10.951 --> 01:52:11.620
<v Speaker 6>sexual harassment because one of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>comedians talked her into it.</v>

2585
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.160
<v Speaker 6>He's like building.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was sexual harassment you should </v>

2586
01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:17.160
<v Speaker 6>call Wendy.</v>

2587
01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:17.160
<v Speaker 6>So she called.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what happened.</v>

2588
01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:19.090
<v Speaker 6>That's all I want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all it was.</v>

2589
01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:21.550
<v Speaker 6>And even at now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's not even what it was.</v>

2590
01:52:21.551 --> 01:52:24.280
<v Speaker 6>That sexual harassment is sexual </v>
<v Speaker 6>harassment.</v>

2591
01:52:24.281 --> 01:52:26.590
<v Speaker 6>Harassment is whatever you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's the definition of it though,</v>

2592
01:52:26.591 --> 01:52:27.350
<v Speaker 6>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2593
01:52:27.370 --> 01:52:30.910
<v Speaker 6>I always assume that it's someone who </v>
<v Speaker 6>has power over someone and like,</v>

2594
01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:35.940
<v Speaker 6>like a boss that's like saying stupid </v>
<v Speaker 6>sexual shit to an employee any unwanted.</v>

2595
01:52:37.590 --> 01:52:40.460
<v Speaker 6>The fact that she ran towards and on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she read souls.</v>

2596
01:52:40.461 --> 01:52:43.030
<v Speaker 6>The thing was that saint can't be sexual</v>
<v Speaker 6>harassment.</v>

2597
01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:44.760
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't really matter.</v>

2598
01:52:44.800 --> 01:52:49.800
<v Speaker 6>Girl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the fucking buddy told her and when the </v>

2599
01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:50.320
<v Speaker 6>shit and told me I couldn't come in and </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2600
01:52:51.180 --> 01:52:56.180
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you went on the radio and then </v>

2601
01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:56.180
<v Speaker 6>you signed the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what,</v>

2602
01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.260
<v Speaker 6>I'm a thief.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll fucking shoot you if I have to.</v>

2603
01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:58.580
<v Speaker 6>I'm not a sexual predator.</v>

2604
01:52:58.790 --> 01:53:01.820
<v Speaker 6>So for that fat to say something like </v>
<v Speaker 6>that is fucking wrong,</v>

2605
01:53:01.821 --> 01:53:06.821
<v Speaker 6>but let me give you the flip side.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She's still stuck with her fat ass and </v>

2606
01:53:06.821 --> 01:53:06.821
<v Speaker 6>then when I'm here living in my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

2607
01:53:06.821 --> 01:53:11.590
<v Speaker 6>So she did me a favor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The best thing about what's going on in </v>

2608
01:53:11.590 --> 01:53:11.990
<v Speaker 6>that was going to kill my ex wife,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my ex wife or husband.</v>

2609
01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:17.340
<v Speaker 6>I was going to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was already content to get a fax </v>

2610
01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:17.960
<v Speaker 6>machine and write jokes for fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>Leno.</v>

2611
01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.780
<v Speaker 6>They weren't going to present me what </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were doing for my daughter.</v>

2612
01:53:20.781 --> 01:53:23.510
<v Speaker 6>I was gonna have my buddies chip in $10.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was 94.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I wasn't having to get me a fax machine </v>
<v Speaker 6>that was going to be in jail.</v>

2614
01:53:26.211 --> 01:53:29.120
<v Speaker 6>Writing jokes for them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I already had a plan and really.</v>

2615
01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:31.100
<v Speaker 6>And one day I actually caught myself </v>

<v Speaker 6>fucking mother,</v>

2619
01:53:37.610 --> 01:53:39.050
<v Speaker 6>so I can't kill the mother.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just kill him.</v>

<v Speaker 6>with two felonies.</v>

<v Speaker 6>I had two felonies in boulder and he </v>
<v Speaker 6>caught.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Don't you ever say nothing to me ever </v>

2725
01:57:51.590 --> 01:57:55.730
<v Speaker 6>until you know the feeling when you pick</v>
<v Speaker 6>up your fucking daughter and she smells </v>

2726
01:57:55.730 --> 01:57:55.730
<v Speaker 6>like another man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joe,</v>

2727
01:57:55.730 --> 01:57:57.480
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure somebody can say something to </v>
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>

2728
01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:00.670
<v Speaker 6>but until then,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't ever say something like that.</v>

2729
01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:02.460
<v Speaker 6>But this woman is allowed to live her </v>
<v Speaker 6>life.</v>

2730
01:58:02.730 --> 01:58:04.060
<v Speaker 6>She's a lot to live her life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so she.</v>

2731
01:58:04.061 --> 01:58:09.061
<v Speaker 6>You think she's got to get your </v>
<v Speaker 6>permission before she came in with a </v>

2732
01:58:09.061 --> 01:58:11.690
<v Speaker 6>man?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are you especially is raising the </v>

2733
01:58:11.690 --> 01:58:11.690
<v Speaker 6>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's where it gets tricky.</v>

2734
01:58:11.690 --> 01:58:12.030
<v Speaker 6>Support.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You were fucking joint.</v>

2735
01:58:12.090 --> 01:58:14.670
<v Speaker 6>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joint fucking custody.</v>

2736
01:58:14.671 --> 01:58:17.740
<v Speaker 6>You still cost money to raise the kid </v>
<v Speaker 6>and she lives with a guy constantly.</v>

2737
01:58:17.850 --> 01:58:19.620
<v Speaker 6>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I'm paying child support.</v>

2738
01:58:19.670 --> 01:58:21.420
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how that works.</v>

2739
01:58:22.050 --> 01:58:27.050
<v Speaker 6>What do you mean a woman can not just </v>
<v Speaker 6>moving your daughter's room with a man </v>

2740
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.050
<v Speaker 6>is illegal.</v>

2741
01:58:27.050 --> 01:58:27.450
<v Speaker 6>It's it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's us.</v>

2742
01:58:28.190 --> 01:58:31.140
<v Speaker 6>You just can't wake up one day and your </v>
<v Speaker 6>daughter moves a fucking.</v>

2743
01:58:31.180 --> 01:58:33.460
<v Speaker 6>What is her?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are her rights or her legal?</v>

2744
01:58:33.540 --> 01:58:34.530
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't quote Perry.</v>

2745
01:58:34.531 --> 01:58:35.580
<v Speaker 6>Mason.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2746
01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:40.640
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm from the street of rights to come </v>

2747
01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:40.640
<v Speaker 6>through like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know what I'm saying?</v>

2748
01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:44.181
<v Speaker 6>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if she doesn't want to deal with you </v>

2749
01:58:44.181 --> 01:58:45.501
<v Speaker 6>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if she doesn't want to deal with you </v>

2750
01:58:45.501 --> 01:58:45.501
<v Speaker 6>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she wants a minute ago with the guy,</v>

2751
01:58:45.501 --> 01:58:49.460
<v Speaker 6>she has to get your permission.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You want to do whatever the fuck you </v>

2752
01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:50.320
<v Speaker 6>want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You do the fuck you want to do,</v>

2753
01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:53.470
<v Speaker 6>but you can't take your daughter into </v>
<v Speaker 6>some other woman's house will.</v>

2754
01:58:53.471 --> 01:58:54.940
<v Speaker 6>I've seen that woman and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

2755
01:58:55.750 --> 01:58:58.720
<v Speaker 6>I got a woman and I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's all I'm asking from anybody.</v>

2756
01:58:59.170 --> 01:59:00.820
<v Speaker 6>That's it just commonly looked at me in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the eye.</v>

2757
01:59:00.821 --> 01:59:01.870
<v Speaker 6>Don't give me no bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bro.</v>

2758
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:06.870
<v Speaker 6>This is what men don't tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You asked somebody if your daughter and </v>

2759
01:59:06.870 --> 01:59:10.861
<v Speaker 6>your wife are going to move in with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy right now when you want to come to </v>

2760
01:59:10.861 --> 01:59:11.680
<v Speaker 6>you and the Lord Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joey,</v>

2761
01:59:11.710 --> 01:59:16.710
<v Speaker 6>what are you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're getting in an argument with </v>

2762
01:59:16.710 --> 01:59:16.710
<v Speaker 6>someone who's not even.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm arguing with society.</v>

2763
01:59:16.710 --> 01:59:17.170
<v Speaker 6>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm saying.</v>

2764
01:59:17.171 --> 01:59:18.810
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to listen to the saying to me </v>
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>

2765
01:59:19.970 --> 01:59:21.130
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get crazy right?</v>

2766
01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:25.750
<v Speaker 6>A woman has a right to be away from my </v>
<v Speaker 6>man and what is she going to go?</v>

2767
01:59:25.820 --> 01:59:27.910
<v Speaker 6>She's raising a kid out less.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to.</v>

2768
01:59:27.970 --> 01:59:32.970
<v Speaker 6>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When a woman wants to leave another </v>

2769
01:59:32.970 --> 01:59:32.970
<v Speaker 6>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's one thing.</v>

2770
01:59:32.970 --> 01:59:34.480
<v Speaker 6>You don't have to tell me nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're moving your daughter.</v>

2771
01:59:34.780 --> 01:59:36.330
<v Speaker 6>She's three or four.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You got to come.</v>

2772
01:59:36.490 --> 01:59:36.860
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I.</v>

2773
01:59:36.861 --> 01:59:41.861
<v Speaker 6>I agree that it's got to be a very hairy</v>
<v Speaker 6>situation to have some man around your </v>

2774
01:59:41.861 --> 01:59:46.081
<v Speaker 6>child,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when you know that he's </v>

2775
01:59:46.081 --> 01:59:47.971
<v Speaker 6>talking some shit about you and he's was</v>
<v Speaker 6>raising your daughters terrible before </v>

2776
01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:49.780
<v Speaker 6>somebody moves.</v>

2777
01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:53.530
<v Speaker 6>You're kidding with another person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They should contact you and say,</v>

2778
01:59:53.531 --> 01:59:55.780
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fell in love with somebody.</v>

2779
01:59:55.781 --> 02:00:00.781
<v Speaker 6>I want to move my kid in there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but most women make the mistake when </v>

2780
02:00:00.781 --> 02:00:03.601
<v Speaker 6>they get separated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the jump in the sack with somebody just </v>

2781
02:00:03.601 --> 02:00:03.700
<v Speaker 6>to hurt the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen it a thousand times.</v>

2782
02:00:03.740 --> 02:00:08.740
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that's why they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just know they do it because they </v>

2783
02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:08.740
<v Speaker 6>want to jump into bed with somebody that</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2784
02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:11.120
<v Speaker 6>think about all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Look at what happened with being candid.</v>

2785
02:00:11.130 --> 02:00:14.220
<v Speaker 6>His wife jumped into bed with Zulu </v>
<v Speaker 6>nation and he fucked cane.</v>

2786
02:00:14.590 --> 02:00:19.590

<v Speaker 6>Dean Kane came home one day and he </v>

2787
02:00:19.590 --> 02:00:19.590

<v Speaker 6>story?</v>

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he came home and the wife had moved the </v>

<v Speaker 6>with another fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He did the same thing.</v>

02:02:45.481 --> 02:02:50.481
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are also telling me that there's </v>

2850
02:02:50.481 --> 02:02:51.650
<v Speaker 1>many different kinds of Hash tricombs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

2851
02:02:51.690 --> 02:02:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess some people actually do call it </v>
<v Speaker 1>resin.</v>

2852
02:02:53.790 --> 02:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not resonate as a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand resin I think.</v>

2853
02:02:56.431 --> 02:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like the Olympic</v>

2857
02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:07.090
<v Speaker 6>fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They would stamp it with like,</v>

2858
02:03:07.091 --> 02:03:12.091
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it would be like the medium grade would </v>

2859
02:03:12.091 --> 02:03:12.091
<v Speaker 6>be bronze,</v>
<v Speaker 6>medium will be serving the best would be</v>

2860
02:03:12.091 --> 02:03:13.000
<v Speaker 6>like Goldman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They used to have them.</v>

2861
02:03:13.001 --> 02:03:18.001
<v Speaker 6>I have a platinum coding,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so that's how you judge Hash in the old </v>

2862
02:03:18.001 --> 02:03:18.001
<v Speaker 6>days when you got it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people would say,</v>

2863
02:03:18.001 --> 02:03:18.610
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking platinum.</v>

2864
02:03:18.611 --> 02:03:20.460
<v Speaker 6>You can't get no that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So that's,</v>

2865
02:03:20.490 --> 02:03:21.850
<v Speaker 6>that's the emperor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not kidding.</v>

2866
02:03:22.170 --> 02:03:23.770
<v Speaker 6>These are jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The emperor,</v>

2867
02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:26.110
<v Speaker 6>wherever it would make the hash,</v>
<v Speaker 6>before they shipped it over here,</v>

2868
02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:31.320
<v Speaker 6>they would stamp it for your approval </v>
<v Speaker 6>and that's what you always wanted to </v>

2869
02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:34.171
<v Speaker 6>get.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You always wanted to get the hash with </v>

2870
02:03:34.171 --> 02:03:34.171
<v Speaker 6>the stamp.</v>

2871
02:03:34.171 --> 02:03:34.171
<v Speaker 1>What I was talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma,</v>

2872
02:03:34.171 --> 02:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma Senate approves life in prison </v>
<v Speaker 1>for making hash of you make Hash.</v>

2873
02:03:39.021 --> 02:03:42.080
<v Speaker 1>They will give you life in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

2874
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:45.140
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing how stupid they are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma.</v>

2875
02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:48.800
<v Speaker 1>That is so fucking dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that somehow or another,</v>

2876
02:03:48.801 --> 02:03:51.590
<v Speaker 1>this is some dangerous drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do they think this is math?</v>

2877
02:03:51.620 --> 02:03:53.660
<v Speaker 1>What do you get from making meth in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma?</v>

2878
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Because if you get life in jail for if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get life in jail for making hash,</v>

2879
02:03:57.950 --> 02:04:00.050
<v Speaker 1>they should shoot everyone you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>met.</v>

2880
02:04:00.051 --> 02:04:05.051
<v Speaker 1>If you make meth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should kill you and then shoot </v>

2881
02:04:05.051 --> 02:04:07.350
<v Speaker 1>everyone you've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone you love should die for shut.</v>

2882
02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:12.360
<v Speaker 1>The Hash has never killed anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only times I was smoking hash and </v>

2883
02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just said,</v>

2884
02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really high.</v>

2885
02:04:13.100 --> 02:04:13.550
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2886
02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:16.660
<v Speaker 6>Hash is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you work at your store,</v>

2887
02:04:17.070 --> 02:04:19.510
<v Speaker 6>you eat little pieces of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh God.</v>

2888
02:04:19.511 --> 02:04:21.160
<v Speaker 6>The next day you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>often</v>

2889
02:04:21.490 --> 02:04:26.490
<v Speaker 1>there's a beautiful fucking story on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kid who had autism and his parents were </v>

2890
02:04:26.490 --> 02:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>given them hash and it killed his </v>
<v Speaker 1>autism.</v>

2891
02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:33.900
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kid like wouldn't interact with </v>

2892
02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:33.900
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The black chicks I did.</v>

2893
02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:33.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2894
02:04:33.900 --> 02:04:33.900
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a different one.</v>

2895
02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:39.120
<v Speaker 1>So different was a white kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy in northern California and </v>

2896
02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.701
<v Speaker 1>he cut a little tiny piece of hash and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he would stick it inside of a melon and </v>

2897
02:04:41.701 --> 02:04:45.741
<v Speaker 1>he would give it to his boy and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden this kid was interacting with </v>

2898
02:04:45.741 --> 02:04:46.890
<v Speaker 1>people and he was calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was relaxed and there was another one</v>

2899
02:04:46.891 --> 02:04:49.170
<v Speaker 1>with a black kid to where they're given </v>
<v Speaker 1>a medical marijuana.</v>

2900
02:04:50.190 --> 02:04:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Oklahoma,</v>

2901
02:04:51.451 --> 02:04:55.080
<v Speaker 1>that's shit puts you in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In prison in April 20.</v>

2902
02:04:55.081 --> 02:04:58.580
<v Speaker 1>First of 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an Oklahoma.</v>

2903
02:04:58.610 --> 02:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>So not anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>

2904
02:05:02.090 --> 02:05:04.850
<v Speaker 1>There's certain places where somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else might.</v>

2905
02:05:04.851 --> 02:05:07.050
<v Speaker 1>They got to get this test for welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

2906
02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking bull.</v>

2907
02:05:10.260 --> 02:05:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Welfare is such a tricky thing because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>love the idea that people can count on </v>

2908
02:05:15.810 --> 02:05:18.060
<v Speaker 1>people to help them out if something </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes wrong,</v>

2909
02:05:18.210 --> 02:05:21.450
<v Speaker 1>but human nature is a motherfucker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>human nature is.</v>

2910
02:05:21.451 --> 02:05:23.890
<v Speaker 1>If you give people the ability to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>work there,</v>

2911
02:05:24.030 --> 02:05:24.960
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take it.</v>

2912
02:05:27.540 --> 02:05:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I never understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People went there and said,</v>

2913
02:05:30.051 --> 02:05:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I claimed craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's $600 a month so you don't have to</v>

2914
02:05:33.751 --> 02:05:35.460
<v Speaker 1>work and you're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting $6.</v>

2915
02:05:36.090 --> 02:05:38.910
<v Speaker 1>You can't live on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't understand why you're jumping</v>

2916
02:05:38.911 --> 02:05:43.911
<v Speaker 1>up and down so happy for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are happy just to know a </v>

2917
02:05:43.911 --> 02:05:45.180
<v Speaker 1>month or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just seen him about a year ago on TV.</v>

2918
02:05:45.390 --> 02:05:50.390
<v Speaker 1>If you claim craziest 6:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those people in that documentary I </v>

2919
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:52.950
<v Speaker 1>was talking about earlier were </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries that I think we're alone.</v>

2920
02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:56.360
<v Speaker 1>How they made their money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They claim crazy.</v>

2921
02:05:56.361 --> 02:06:01.361
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well because they're not claiming it </v>

2922
02:06:01.361 --> 02:06:01.361
<v Speaker 1>because they had that asperger's or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it's called asperger's.</v>

2923
02:06:01.361 --> 02:06:02.740
<v Speaker 1>You can get money from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2924
02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>I think you should be able to get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>money if there's something fucked up </v>

2925
02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>with you and we should help each other </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2926
02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:09.120
<v Speaker 1>We should help out our brothers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sisters.</v>

2927
02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:12.090
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said about hippies.</v>

2928
02:06:12.210 --> 02:06:14.850
<v Speaker 1>The problem is it's beautiful if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody helps.</v>

2929
02:06:14.851 --> 02:06:19.851
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a circle and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>handing out love to the left and like </v>

2930
02:06:19.851 --> 02:06:20.070
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here have some live,</v>

2931
02:06:20.071 --> 02:06:21.570
<v Speaker 1>it's going to come around back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all.</v>

2932
02:06:21.571 --> 02:06:22.650
<v Speaker 1>We're all community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2933
02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>But with hippies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of hippies when they're in a </v>

2934
02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>circle and they're handing out love to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the left,</v>

2935
02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:32.391
<v Speaker 1>the love gets to them and they step out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the circle and walk away and they </v>

2936
02:06:32.391 --> 02:06:35.070
<v Speaker 1>take that love and they don't pass it </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and they're always taking and not</v>

2937
02:06:35.071 --> 02:06:38.550
<v Speaker 1>giving and that's something that happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a welfare situation.</v>

2938
02:06:38.850 --> 02:06:41.850
<v Speaker 1>You have people who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice if we all help each other out,</v>

2939
02:06:42.090 --> 02:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>but some people just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're greedy and they take that money </v>

2940
02:06:47.090 --> 02:06:50.721
<v Speaker 1>and they just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that somehow or another </v>

2941
02:06:50.721 --> 02:06:50.721
<v Speaker 1>deserve it and other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they use it as a crutch.</v>

2942
02:06:50.721 --> 02:06:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to work because now I got </v>

2943
02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:55.881
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many flaws in human beings </v>

2944
02:06:55.881 --> 02:06:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and and just just human behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to make something like welfare</v>

2945
02:06:58.171 --> 02:07:03.171
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to make it work the way it's </v>

2946
02:07:03.171 --> 02:07:03.171
<v Speaker 1>supposed to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way it's supposed to work,</v>

2947
02:07:03.171 --> 02:07:07.731
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the way society is supposed to </v>

2948
02:07:07.731 --> 02:07:09.651
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are supposed to live in tribes of 50 </v>

2949
02:07:09.651 --> 02:07:10.170
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's supposed to work.</v>

2950
02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:15.320
<v Speaker 1>We're not supposed to be connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three hundred fucking million of us all </v>

2951
02:07:15.320 --> 02:07:17.780
<v Speaker 1>on this one patch of dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is pro postures.</v>

2952
02:07:18.060 --> 02:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>The idea of a fucking community that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 million people have it is </v>

2953
02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:24.800
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when people go on Rob,</v>

2954
02:07:24.801 --> 02:07:26.640
<v Speaker 1>rob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and fuck you.</v>

2955
02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:28.200
<v Speaker 1>So you will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2956
02:07:28.230 --> 02:07:28.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2957
02:07:28.591 --> 02:07:29.030
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2958
02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:31.500
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have everybody in.</v>

2959
02:07:31.501 --> 02:07:34.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't have everybody in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking team.</v>

2960
02:07:34.141 --> 02:07:37.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not that you shouldn't be one </v>
<v Speaker 1>community in your community,</v>

2961
02:07:37.211 --> 02:07:38.980
<v Speaker 1>should compete against every other </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

2962
02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You could all have be under the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

2963
02:07:41.531 --> 02:07:46.531
<v Speaker 1>our umbrella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that all people are </v>

2964
02:07:46.531 --> 02:07:46.531
<v Speaker 1>responsible for all the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2965
02:07:46.531 --> 02:07:47.590
<v Speaker 1>$300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

2966
02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.750
<v Speaker 1>it's too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too many.</v>

2967
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:54.870
<v Speaker 1>There's too much room for craziness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>douchebags and too much neglect and </v>

2968
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:56.350
<v Speaker 1>there's not enough people that are good </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough focus or attention.</v>

2969
02:07:56.530 --> 02:07:59.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just the numbers are too vast for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being,</v>

2970
02:07:59.890 --> 02:08:02.830
<v Speaker 1>a human being belongs in a tribe of </v>
<v Speaker 1>small people,</v>

2971
02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:07.000
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that there's so many of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a small tribe of 50 people,</v>

2972
02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:12.060
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that so many of us that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of are forced into this situation </v>

2973
02:08:12.060 --> 02:08:16.141
<v Speaker 1>where we interact on a daily basis with </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people that we have no idea </v>

2974
02:08:16.141 --> 02:08:20.221
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know anything about them and </v>

2975
02:08:20.221 --> 02:08:20.221
<v Speaker 1>yet we're all combined under the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

2976
02:08:20.221 --> 02:08:20.800
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2977
02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:23.920
<v Speaker 1>That's when welfare becomes nuts because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting money from some people.</v>

2978
02:08:23.921 --> 02:08:25.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't even fucking know these </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2979
02:08:25.091 --> 02:08:26.770
<v Speaker 1>Fuck those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me my money.</v>

2980
02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:31.980
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of being in a tribe of 50 </v>

2981
02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:31.980
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>

2982
02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:31.980
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't you doing your work?</v>

2983
02:08:31.980 --> 02:08:33.730
<v Speaker 1>You need to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a part of a community.</v>

2984
02:08:33.820 --> 02:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>And then you feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel that your.</v>

2985
02:08:35.850 --> 02:08:37.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am slacking.</v>

2986
02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was 10 people on an island and </v>

2987
02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:42.240
<v Speaker 1>one person was sitting around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2988
02:08:42.240 --> 02:08:44.040
<v Speaker 1>if they all got shipwrecked and one </v>
<v Speaker 1>person was sitting around going,</v>

2989
02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:45.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring me my fish year,</v>

2990
02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:46.870
<v Speaker 1>where's my water?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd go,</v>

2991
02:08:46.871 --> 02:08:48.550
<v Speaker 1>we got to kill that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's not using.</v>

2992
02:08:48.580 --> 02:08:49.600
<v Speaker 1>He's not helping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2993
02:08:49.601 --> 02:08:54.601
<v Speaker 1>he's using up our valuable resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to risk our lives fishing and </v>

2994
02:08:54.601 --> 02:08:55.270
<v Speaker 1>getting water and this just sits around </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

2995
02:08:55.360 --> 02:09:00.360
<v Speaker 1>You'd want to kill him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a society with 300 million </v>

2996
02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:03.331
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just becomes another thing you just </v>

2997
02:09:03.331 --> 02:09:03.331
<v Speaker 1>told me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how easy</v>

2998
02:09:03.450 --> 02:09:05.700
<v Speaker 6>they make it for you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know about now,</v>

2999
02:09:05.880 --> 02:09:09.300
<v Speaker 6>but because what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you know how easy they make it.</v>

3000
02:09:09.301 --> 02:09:11.490
<v Speaker 6>For some people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just verizon.</v>

3001
02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:16.520
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you how easy it is so you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>really shit your pants because I really </v>

3002
02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.280
<v Speaker 6>always dropped some money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you get out of prison,</v>

3003
02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:23.380
<v Speaker 6>no matter how old you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you going there for heck of a mass </v>

3004
02:09:23.380 --> 02:09:23.850
<v Speaker 6>followed with a Dui.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You come out when you're 26,</v>

3005
02:09:24.270 --> 02:09:29.270
<v Speaker 6>you could do paperwork and claim </v>
<v Speaker 6>disability because you're a convicted </v>

3006
02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:32.031
<v Speaker 6>felon for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What disability law,</v>

3007
02:09:32.410 --> 02:09:34.190
<v Speaker 6>how is it a disability that you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>convicted?</v>

3008
02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:39.200
<v Speaker 6>Thought of them will say they can't get </v>
<v Speaker 6>the job because they're felons who's </v>

3009
02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:40.260
<v Speaker 6>going to hire a felon,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you get disability or $600 a month.</v>

3010
02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:43.200
<v Speaker 6>You probably just want to keep you from </v>
<v Speaker 6>robbing somebody.</v>

3011
02:09:43.530 --> 02:09:45.810
<v Speaker 6>That's probably the logic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not going to do it.</v>

3012
02:09:45.810 --> 02:09:48.510
<v Speaker 6>What's he going to do if you're on to </v>
<v Speaker 6>give you a little something.</v>

3013
02:09:48.540 --> 02:09:51.000
<v Speaker 6>So it was really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I remember leaving there,</v>

3014
02:09:51.001 --> 02:09:55.020
<v Speaker 6>but when my mother died,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she worked under her alias.</v>

3015
02:09:55.410 --> 02:10:00.410
<v Speaker 6>My mother had an alias all those years </v>
<v Speaker 6>because after she stabbed the guy in </v>

3016
02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:03.351
<v Speaker 6>Cuba and she came back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she had to change her name because she </v>

3017
02:10:03.351 --> 02:10:06.021
<v Speaker 6>came back with her friend's ID.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My Jimmy runs Jesus Christ deal.</v>

3018
02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:12.260
<v Speaker 6>But it was funny that I had a fight for </v>
<v Speaker 6>social security when my mother died and </v>

3019
02:10:12.260 --> 02:10:12.450
<v Speaker 6>I was 15.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I needed the money.</v>

3020
02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:16.080
<v Speaker 6>Like I went there 10 times to fight them</v>
<v Speaker 6>and oh,</v>

3021
02:10:16.081 --> 02:10:18.240
<v Speaker 6>we don't know what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't you know,</v>

3022
02:10:18.630 --> 02:10:21.150
<v Speaker 6>at least give me a $200.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't need the money Joe,</v>

3023
02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:24.170
<v Speaker 6>but it was just so weird that finally </v>
<v Speaker 6>when they're selling me this,</v>

3024
02:10:24.171 --> 02:10:25.920
<v Speaker 6>I'd go steal for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I go sold drugs.</v>

3025
02:10:25.921 --> 02:10:29.580
<v Speaker 6>I never took after all the drama they </v>
<v Speaker 6>put me through for social security,</v>

3026
02:10:30.210 --> 02:10:32.400
<v Speaker 6>but they give it to me after I got a </v>
<v Speaker 6>felony.</v>

3027
02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:33.860
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just like that</v>

3028
02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:36.380
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$600 a month.</v>

3029
02:10:36.590 --> 02:10:41.590
<v Speaker 1>That would get on the fifth of every </v>
<v Speaker 1>month and if you claim that they talk </v>

3030
02:10:41.590 --> 02:10:42.110
<v Speaker 1>about the different disabilities and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>

3031
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:44.150
<v Speaker 1>you could get up to like $1,200</v>
<v Speaker 1>a month.</v>

3032
02:10:44.180 --> 02:10:49.180
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if people were ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve to the point where a society </v>

3033
02:10:49.180 --> 02:10:53.530
<v Speaker 1>actually can work if like what our </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is is that society and cities </v>

3034
02:10:53.721 --> 02:10:58.721
<v Speaker 1>and these giant ideas of countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they happen so quickly and the </v>

3035
02:10:58.721 --> 02:11:00.400
<v Speaker 1>development of the human animal that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

3036
02:11:00.401 --> 02:11:05.401
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't really evolved enough with </v>

3037
02:11:05.401 --> 02:11:05.720
<v Speaker 1>our minds and our behavior to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

3038
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:10.750
<v Speaker 1>to operate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to operate really in a harmonic way</v>

3039
02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:14.210
<v Speaker 1>with a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's all this crime.</v>

3040
02:11:14.211 --> 02:11:15.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's why there's all this </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

3041
02:11:15.710 --> 02:11:20.710
<v Speaker 1>That's why there's all these things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not be tolerated in the natural </v>

3042
02:11:20.710 --> 02:11:23.981
<v Speaker 1>group of 50 people that all know each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other and love each other and support </v>

3043
02:11:23.981 --> 02:11:23.981
<v Speaker 1>each other like we are.</v>

3044
02:11:23.981 --> 02:11:26.930
<v Speaker 1>We're designed to operate in tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very obvious.</v>

3045
02:11:26.931 --> 02:11:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to be on a team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to have a family,</v>

3046
02:11:29.781 --> 02:11:31.880
<v Speaker 1>everybody wants to have friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to have a group.</v>

3047
02:11:32.010 --> 02:11:35.030
<v Speaker 1>You know where the death squad look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are like a little family.</v>

3048
02:11:35.180 --> 02:11:37.430
<v Speaker 1>We call ourselves a death squad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us together,</v>

3049
02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why we call it with Opi </v>

3050
02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:43.490
<v Speaker 1>from opiod anthony named is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like 19 fucking whatever the hell it</v>

3051
02:11:43.491 --> 02:11:45.350
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2003 or whatever it was.</v>

3052
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I came in with Eddie Bravo and tate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3053
02:11:48.450 --> 02:11:48.940

3056
02:11:52.490 --> 02:11:54.310
<v Speaker 1>because we were giggling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were like a cost offset.</v>

3057
02:11:54.311 --> 02:11:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Desk Squad were the desk right now and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds so stupid,</v>

3058
02:11:56.930 --> 02:12:01.930
<v Speaker 1>but we call ourselves that and we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this desk squad podcast network and all </v>

3060
02:12:02.900 --> 02:12:03.860
<v Speaker 1>hang out together.</v>

3061
02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:06.290
<v Speaker 1>We are like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little tribe.</v>

3062
02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:08.930
<v Speaker 1>We all liked this little family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a natural thing,</v>

3063
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:12.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's not natural to do it with 300 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people.</v>

3064
02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:15.350
<v Speaker 1>If we were all together and we all lived</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

3065
02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:17.480
<v Speaker 1>it would be normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all love each other.</v>

3066
02:12:17.481 --> 02:12:19.610
<v Speaker 1>We all take care of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look out for each other.</v>

3067
02:12:19.611 --> 02:12:21.590
<v Speaker 1>If something's happening to one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to help,</v>

3068
02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:23.210
<v Speaker 1>you know that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's normal shit.</v>

3069
02:12:23.870 --> 02:12:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if if it's ever going to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where we could operate like </v>

3070
02:12:28.870 --> 02:12:32.291
<v Speaker 1>that with 300 million people because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously doesn't work right now when </v>

3071
02:12:32.291 --> 02:12:33.770
<v Speaker 1>you have crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's that,</v>

3072
02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:38.830
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to say never because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that human interaction and what </v>

3073
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>where we are right now is so different </v>
<v Speaker 1>than where it was in the thirties and </v>

3074
02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:46.280
<v Speaker 1>the twenties in the fifties and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>really 10 years ago.</v>

3075
02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Social Media and the interaction that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have with human beings today,</v>

3076
02:12:49.821 --> 02:12:52.730
<v Speaker 1>the interaction that we have on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>just with twitter alone,</v>

3077
02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it's so different than than human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>who grew up in a different generation </v>

3078
02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:02.431
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have this and our connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other is very different than </v>

3079
02:13:02.431 --> 02:13:06.551
<v Speaker 1>people that grew up in a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation and I think that that's part </v>

3080
02:13:06.551 --> 02:13:10.271
<v Speaker 1>of the evolution of the human being and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that human beings are slowly </v>

3081
02:13:10.271 --> 02:13:14.861
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out how to work </v>
<v Speaker 1>together in these big giant ass fucking </v>

3082
02:13:14.861 --> 02:13:16.640
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's impossible.</v>

3083
02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:21.940
<v Speaker 1>It obviously depends on raising children</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly and not developing incredibly </v>

3084
02:13:22.791 --> 02:13:25.670
<v Speaker 1>fucked up human beings that are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>liability,</v>

3085
02:13:26.060 --> 02:13:31.060
<v Speaker 1>but that's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You grew up fucked up and you're not a </v>

3086
02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:31.060
<v Speaker 1>liability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

3087
02:13:31.060 --> 02:13:35.820
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about the craziest stories </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've told just today about wanting to </v>

3088
02:13:35.820 --> 02:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>kill people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smacking people,</v>

3089
02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:41.240
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're a criminal and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thief and that you've been to jail and </v>

3090
02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:44.181
<v Speaker 1>all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet here you are hanging out at my </v>

3091
02:13:44.181 --> 02:13:44.181
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

3092
02:13:44.181 --> 02:13:44.181
<v Speaker 1>She went on to my best friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very productive.</v>

3093
02:13:44.181 --> 02:13:45.390
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking beautiful standup </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian,</v>

3094
02:13:45.570 --> 02:13:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you're a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a great podcast,</v>

3095
02:13:47.950 --> 02:13:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you pulled it together to become </v>

3096
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:53.130
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Brian,</v>

3097
02:13:53.160 --> 02:13:54.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from fucking Columbus,</v>

3098
02:13:54.811 --> 02:13:59.811
<v Speaker 1>Ohio and working in a fucking gateway </v>
<v Speaker 1>and being stuck in this town and you </v>

3099
02:13:59.811 --> 02:14:04.551
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being surrounded by a bunch of </v>

3100
02:14:04.551 --> 02:14:04.551
<v Speaker 1>knuckleheads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've pulled it together,</v>

3101
02:14:04.551 --> 02:14:05.970
<v Speaker 1>you've become someone different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all evolve.</v>

3102
02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:11.000
<v Speaker 1>We all move into some new phase of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>and interact with everybody that's </v>

3103
02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.570
<v Speaker 1>around us in a very different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible on a mass level?</v>

3104
02:14:15.750 --> 02:14:20.750
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible as a society that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>all hold each other accountable,</v>

3105
02:14:21.210 --> 02:14:26.210
<v Speaker 1>all of us individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you become 300 million people </v>

3106
02:14:26.210 --> 02:14:26.210
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3107
02:14:26.210 --> 02:14:26.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3108
02:14:26.210 --> 02:14:30.550
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We come from a society where people </v>

3109
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.550
<v Speaker 6>don't give a fuck with two fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>selfish.</v>

3110
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:33.200
<v Speaker 6>Some computers and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've separated us even more.</v>

3111
02:14:33.260 --> 02:14:37.010
<v Speaker 6>I think they can separate us even more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like human contact.</v>

3112
02:14:37.011 --> 02:14:38.480
<v Speaker 6>I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I like this.</v>

3113
02:14:38.820 --> 02:14:41.960
<v Speaker 6>My computer guy was really good too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I said to Eddie,</v>

3114
02:14:41.961 --> 02:14:46.961
<v Speaker 6>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can you call and you take a picture and </v>

<v Speaker 6>You said to me when that,</v>

3116
02:14:46.961 --> 02:14:48.590
<v Speaker 6>can you take a picture and put it on </v>
<v Speaker 6>twitter?</v>

3117
02:14:48.591 --> 02:14:49.100
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3118
02:14:49.101 --> 02:14:50.420
<v Speaker 6>my wife goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you could do it too.</v>

3119
02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:51.510
<v Speaker 6>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you don't want.</v>

3120
02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.790
<v Speaker 6>But I'm out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm living my life.</v>

3121
02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:54.500
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to be beat a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 6>computer when I'm out.</v>

3122
02:14:54.650 --> 02:14:57.200
<v Speaker 6>That means you're not fucking livid when</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm out of my house.</v>

3123
02:14:57.201 --> 02:14:59.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to say twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to see facebook.</v>

3124
02:14:59.450 --> 02:15:00.230
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to seem nothing.</v>

3125
02:15:00.230 --> 02:15:02.420
<v Speaker 6>I'm living my fucking life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what the problem is,</v>

3126
02:15:02.421 --> 02:15:07.421
<v Speaker 6>that people are not living no more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were on these fucking things too </v>

3127
02:15:07.421 --> 02:15:07.421
<v Speaker 6>much and it's losing a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 6>human touch.</v>

3128
02:15:07.610 --> 02:15:12.610
<v Speaker 6>That's what we all do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what I feel I feel between the </v>

3129
02:15:12.610 --> 02:15:12.610
<v Speaker 6>texting and a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It cuts time,</v>

3130
02:15:12.610 --> 02:15:14.630
<v Speaker 6>but we'll losing human contact.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's making us lazy.</v>

3131
02:15:14.631 --> 02:15:19.631
<v Speaker 6>A couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>commercial came out and it was about a </v>

3132
02:15:19.631 --> 02:15:19.631
<v Speaker 6>business and the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm having a meeting.</v>

<v Speaker 6>and the people will like,</v>

3134
02:15:22.541 --> 02:15:23.640
<v Speaker 6>the salesmen were like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>or something.</v>

<v Speaker 6>We're going to go back to belly to belly</v>
<v Speaker 6>sales to,</v>

02:15:34.760 --> 02:15:36.160
<v Speaker 6>talk to people again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3141
02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:37.360
<v Speaker 6>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

3142
02:15:37.490 --> 02:15:40.160
<v Speaker 6>we're so lose now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this fucking crime.</v>

3143
02:15:40.160 --> 02:15:42.050

<v Speaker 6>England.</v>

3144
02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:46.100
<v Speaker 6>Mexico's as volatile as it's ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're in no danger.</v>

3145
02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:51.280
<v Speaker 6>We can't even drive in fucking Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 6>because people won't even put that </v>

3146
02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:51.280
<v Speaker 6>fucking blinkers on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're so selfish.</v>

3147
02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:56.050
<v Speaker 6>That's the first way of changing Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The way I changed was to start from </v>

3148
02:15:56.050 --> 02:15:57.020
<v Speaker 6>scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you can't pick up a piece of paper as</v>

3149
02:15:57.021 --> 02:15:59.480
<v Speaker 6>you're walking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to change if you can't.</v>

3150
02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:00.320
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I used to,</v>

3151
02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:03.290
<v Speaker 6>when I got the longest shot and I used </v>
<v Speaker 6>to go to all these meetings in Hollywood</v>

3152
02:16:03.530 --> 02:16:08.530
<v Speaker 6>and you go to all these meetings and </v>
<v Speaker 6>every fucking meeting you go to some </v>

3153
02:16:08.530 --> 02:16:10.160
<v Speaker 6>dumb motherfucker shows up 20 minutes </v>
<v Speaker 6>late and says to you,</v>

<v Speaker 6>caught myself and I go,</v>

3159
02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:24.110
<v Speaker 6>For me to be a better productive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have to show people,</v>

3160
02:16:24.350 --> 02:16:26.240
<v Speaker 6>not tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>show people,</v>

3161
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:28.580
<v Speaker 6>and now when I get to a meeting and </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're 20 minutes late,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I say something to you because we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>men.</v>

3166
02:16:41.610 --> 02:16:41.710
<v Speaker 4>destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it all starts with little things.</v>

3167
02:16:41.830 --> 02:16:45.550
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't start with being a fake and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts with little things.</v>

3168
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:48.160
<v Speaker 4>It's character is what people don't see </v>
<v Speaker 4>you doing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's the things that pit and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've forgotten.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's ridiculous.</v>

3269
02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:57.760
<v Speaker 1>and it makes you more impulsive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy and that's probably true.</v>

<v Speaker 2>find links and copy and paste and </v>

3426
02:26:49.770 --> 02:26:51.130

<v Speaker 5>I have to judge them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to judge them based on my </v>

3527
02:30:47.130 --> 02:30:47.980
<v Speaker 5>interactions and my interactions with </v>
<v Speaker 5>him have always been cool.</v>

3528
02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:49.990
<v Speaker 5>He's always been nice to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never had a problem with them.</v>

3529
02:30:49.991 --> 02:30:51.970
<v Speaker 5>He's always been cool with me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

3530
02:30:51.971 --> 02:30:56.971
<v Speaker 5>I don't like reading all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like seeing anybody doing shit </v>

3531
02:30:56.971 --> 02:30:59.210
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But you did that to Brian to you know,</v>

3532
02:30:59.220 --> 02:31:00.910
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>

3533
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:06.070
<v Speaker 5>just the same way back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's the same fucking way he went </v>

3534
02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:07.450
<v Speaker 5>after him on twitter the exact same way </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you're criticizing right here.</v>

3536
02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:14.910
<v Speaker 5>and if you want to really know Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was these motherfuckers that got us </v>

<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

3554
02:31:57.150 --> 02:32:02.150

<v Speaker 4>That's why I don't deal with a lot of </v>

3555
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:03.711
<v Speaker 4>these fucking guys because I know it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to end up and this is the type of </v>

3556
02:32:03.711 --> 02:32:04.080
<v Speaker 4>person I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how that deal.</v>

3557
02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:06.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to argue that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to go to court.</v>

3558
02:32:06.770 --> 02:32:10.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how to play those games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are not games that I grew up plan.</v>

3559
02:32:10.380 --> 02:32:13.100
<v Speaker 4>So when people throw that at me or be </v>
<v Speaker 4>bureaucratics,</v>

3560
02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:15.090
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck that word is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't deal with that.</v>

3563
02:32:21.890 --> 02:32:21.890
<v Speaker 4>because if you don't know that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I suspect</v>

3564
02:32:24.060 --> 02:32:26.230
<v Speaker 5>if they don't come talk to me like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

02:32:27.140 --> 02:32:32.140
<v Speaker 4>they don't come talk to you like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you got to suspect that containers </v>

3567
02:32:32.140 --> 02:32:36.340
<v Speaker 4>and then you don't want after a while </v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to do it on them because I </v>

3568
02:32:36.340 --> 02:32:37.160
<v Speaker 4>know like my mom used to say if it sucks</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the beginning it's gonna suck all the</v>

3569
02:32:37.161 --> 02:32:38.810
