8
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.640

<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

10
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.240

<v Speaker 1>unemployed.</v>

11
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more.</v>

12
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>It takes more to just say that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployed until you're like,</v>

13
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of projects going on.</v>

14
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>I've got a lot of fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of pies.</v>

15
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm freelance now.</v>

16
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>But aren't you self employed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>So that's not unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

18
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:29.630
<v Speaker 1>but I like fucking with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

19
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you make them feel sad for you and make</v>
<v Speaker 1>them feel because people,</v>

20
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>people want you to immediately say like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing okay and unemployed</v>

21
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>makes you sound like a bum.</v>

22
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>So I like starting from the lowest</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible position.</v>

23
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>You should tell people that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a trailer and a,</v>

24
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.920
<v Speaker 1>you're going to travel across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crunch.</v>

25
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>You get one of those things dragged</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind your car is going to live out of</v>

26
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the national parks,</v>

27
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>the mall wakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a full time job that strong</v>

28
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:56.530
<v Speaker 1>of my accent skin and get pale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just dammit nickname,</v>

29
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 1>nickname.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my trailer.</v>

30
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had a job in 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't go from Australian accent too.</v>

31
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Just did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans did it.</v>

32
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I just did it on allow that many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that things are impossible.</v>

33
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm here to prove them wrong.</v>

34
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have you moved to a place</v>

35
00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to adopt the accent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if an American moves to England,</v>

36
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 1>like remember when Madonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was only there for like six months.</v>

37
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>She started talking like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>

38
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of here.</v>

39
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Like we know that people talk like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we know it's a style of.</v>

40
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It's an affectation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You decided to talk like that.</v>

41
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to talk like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could obviously,</v>

42
00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>when you watch British actors play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans do a brilliant job of talking</v>

43
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>in an American accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the walking dead people.</v>

44
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>When people find out that rick is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he's,</v>

45
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>he's from England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from England,</v>

46
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>the girl Maggie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's from England.</v>

47
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Everybody from fucking England.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know that those</v>

49
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>are aussies as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're doing all over the American</v>

50
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>accents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How often does Russell Crowe and don't</v>

51
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>have an American accent and imagery and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>what's his face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Batman.</v>

53
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Christian Bale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Australian English.</v>

54
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Same Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me started on the differences</v>

55
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>between New Zealand.</v>

56
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Isn't Australians as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this whole thing about who fuck</v>

57
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the same spot,</v>

58
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conduct condo.</v>

59
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>It's about as different as Canada and</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

60
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 1>Not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not very rarely.</v>

61
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Barely close enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

62
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of dispute between the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

63
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>About which one that has to cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mel Gibson.</v>

64
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>Mel was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think born in New Zealand and there's</v>

65
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>some bullshit about whether the reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>American Australian or New Zealand you</v>

66
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>can have him as long as he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian.</v>

67
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loved him for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was so good.</v>

68
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>He was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just couldn't keep it together.</v>

69
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 1>No wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wildly antisemitic,</v>

70
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>religious nutjob doesn't help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think he's a crazy person though?</v>

72
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that means anything when you're</v>

73
00:02:43.111 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>that famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it does.</v>

74
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 1>It always means something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

75
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>being that famous doesn't discount</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain biological realities of brain</v>

76
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>

77
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I think people are bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Livers or livers go bad.</v>

78
00:02:55.531 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>People get lung cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People without a doubt developed brain</v>

79
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not it's a psychological</v>

80
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning is a disease of thought</v>

81
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:08.401
<v Speaker 1>processes and taking you down bad roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those bad thought process become</v>

82
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:13.681
<v Speaker 1>ingrained and you continue them over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again out of habit or whether or</v>

83
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>not he's obviously an alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

84
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's a real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

85
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:20.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's had some problems like tech,</v>

86
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>lung cancer for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the things that you do to your</v>

87
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>body going to have a large impact on</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you're likely to get lung</v>

88
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.394
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

89
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 1>And similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that living in the rarefied</v>

90
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:34.501
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere of being incredibly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outrageously famous probably put grooves</v>

91
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>in your mental pathways that predispose</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to being odd.</v>

92
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

93
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you get older,</v>

94
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>when things start to fall apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>physically and psychologically and</v>
<v Speaker 1>maritally and you know,</v>

96
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>when he was with that crazy lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what that is,</v>

97
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>is like the ultimate three court.</v>

98
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>It's not midlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's three quarters life like dilemma.</v>

99
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many people do you surround</v>

100
00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>yourself with when you at that level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>superstardom who were willing to call</v>

101
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>bullshit on your bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>Like I think a healthy famous person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will know them as people who are able</v>

103
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>to keep their head screwed on because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still surround themselves with a</v>

104
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>posse who were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

105
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing with this?</v>

106
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>You've got a Latin mass still doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pre reformation Catholic,</v>

107
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 1>like liturgies up on a hill in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood hills and you're talking about</v>

108
00:04:19.181 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>how Jews caused all the wars in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

109
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

110
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>This is why people like buddy cop</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

111
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Because in a buddy cop movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danny Glover would straighten them back</v>

112
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

113
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it together,</v>

114
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>and then he will pull it together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stop being crazy what?</v>

115
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>He's by himself on a fucking mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Malibu's screaming at the help</v>

116
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>yelling at his Russian guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the name of his character?</v>

117
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 1>And more open to doing what Mel Gibson's</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rigs rigs.</v>

118
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>So Mel Gibson needs a danny glover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way that mountain riggs did.</v>

119
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs Danny Glover,</v>

120
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>the actual Danny Glover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you pay attention to Danny</v>

121
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Glover's twitter feed and his social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media feed,</v>

122
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:03.601
<v Speaker 1>it's all about like helping people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and charities and spirituality and</v>

123
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>consideration for the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Danny Glover has got a really</v>

124
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll follow him.</v>

125
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.810
<v Speaker 1>He's a very open minded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent guy from the few things that</v>

126
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I've paid attention to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Danny Glover's like paying</v>

127
00:05:16.061 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>attention to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be together for real.</v>

128
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it when people who you admire,</v>

129
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>his craft you admire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow into being something more than</v>

130
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like sort of spiritually</v>

131
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>enlightened.</v>

132
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.820
<v Speaker 1>It was like when Garry shandling died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>he had become someone who was super</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in really interesting things.</v>

134
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:33.784
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

135
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know much about them.</v>

136
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.020
<v Speaker 1>I didn't either until I was following</v>
<v Speaker 1>him on twitter when the day that he died</v>

137
00:05:41.021 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I went to his twitter page to see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>his last tweets were and I saw that he</v>

138
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>was following me for some strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>

139
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:49.870
<v Speaker 1>which makes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me feel like all the more kind of</v>

140
00:05:49.871 --> 00:05:53.560
<v Speaker 1>close to him and started going back</v>
<v Speaker 1>through all of his old tweets and he's</v>

141
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 1>just interested in spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of shit that you and I are</v>

142
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:00.590
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know him.</v>

143
00:06:00.591 --> 00:06:02.450
<v Speaker 1>I met him like re very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

144
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice to meet you at the comedy and Magic</v>

145
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never really got a chance to talk to</v>

146
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God,</v>

147
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:08.864
<v Speaker 1>what a funny guy.</v>

148
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Larry Sanders show was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean two of the most groundbreaking</v>

149
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 1>sitcoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of the,</v>

150
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 1>all of those sitcoms that now like</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern family and everything all have</v>

151
00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

152
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:19.850
<v Speaker 1>this is a pseudo documentary and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

153
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>for some reason talking to the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really make any sense</v>

154
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is this documentary being made</v>

155
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>about these modern family people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long has this documentary?</v>

156
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>Why not always like it's been on for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine years or something?</v>

157
00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Where's the documentary crew?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they talking to the camera dot?</v>

158
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole conceit has broken down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of those shows owe they're</v>

159
00:06:36.531 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>genesis to garry shandling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the fact that he did the Larry</v>

160
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 1>Sanders show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Sanders show and it's Gary</v>

161
00:06:41.511 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>shandling show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had some great stuff.</v>

162
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Really great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's this shit about facebook?</v>

163
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.050
<v Speaker 1>I just walked in here and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

164
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 1>you told me that there are these pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how facebook workers are admitting</v>

165
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 1>that they routinely suppressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative news from the facebook</v>

166
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>newsfeed.</v>

167
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually got it from Steven crowder.</v>

168
00:06:57.231 --> 00:07:00.560
<v Speaker 1>He sent it to me and then I looked it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I saw it was on Gizmodo and I</v>

169
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:01.520
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

170
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.580
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this enforcement of a liberal</v>

171
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 1>liberal ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Former facebook workers says we</v>

172
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>routinely suppressed conservative news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

173
00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would keep conservative news from</v>

174
00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>trending and they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

175
00:07:19.191 --> 00:07:23.090
<v Speaker 1>they would inject stories that weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>trending.</v>

176
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>They would inject them into the trending</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories if they match their ideologies.</v>

177
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so dangerous and upsetting for</v>

178
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>me even if you are a complete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like liberal fascist and,</v>

179
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.920
<v Speaker 1>and you don't believe in freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech or freedom of ideas.</v>

180
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>But Jamie had a very interesting point</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that he was saying,</v>

181
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at the believers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Justin Bieber fans,</v>

182
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.680
<v Speaker 1>they overwhelmed the trending to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point where twitter became the Justin</v>

183
00:07:48.681 --> 00:07:52.100
<v Speaker 1>bieber show and then twitter had to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

184
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>settle the fuck down.</v>

185
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.170
<v Speaker 1>All these little 16 year old girls are</v>
<v Speaker 1>finger banging themselves and slamming</v>

186
00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>their fucking iphones and trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

187
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:03.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to pay attention to this guy</v>

188
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four hours a day.</v>

189
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Those believers are out of their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

190
00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what did twitter do?</v>

191
00:08:09.051 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Something about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Actually de Justin Bieber tweets is</v>

192
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:14.990
<v Speaker 1>that long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like two or three years into twitter</v>

193
00:08:14.991 --> 00:08:18.030
<v Speaker 1>starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's 10 trending topics I believe</v>

194
00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 1>that I remember is like seven out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 were all Justin Bieber.</v>

195
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>This I love Justin Bieber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it was at the time.</v>

196
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to bring that up with Dan are</v>
<v Speaker 1>back from the arcs and the black keys</v>

197
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:34.070
<v Speaker 1>when he was here because he'd got into</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with believers like they got into.</v>

198
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>They got mad at him and done all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people you could just in sheer numbers</v>

199
00:08:39.381 --> 00:08:41.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like taking on a fight with an army</v>

200
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:43.520
<v Speaker 1>of fire ants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just not going to win.</v>

201
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>You know what's interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get mad at you if you are older</v>

202
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>than them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you use twitter,</v>

203
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.430
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things that they love to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say like you fucking old man.</v>

204
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Why are you even on twitter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like as if my generation invented it.</v>

205
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.470
<v Speaker 1>What they're trying to do is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to.</v>

206
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 1>They're acknowledging this is a stupid</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and they would assume that</v>

207
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 1>you're old enough that you realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stupid behavior and you should be</v>

208
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:07.854
<v Speaker 1>better than that.</v>

209
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm allowed to be an immature little</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit.</v>

210
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>John Fourteen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your excuse?</v>

211
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Just that there's something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something that is a part of what</v>

212
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:19.650
<v Speaker 1>they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of the technology and the</v>

213
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:22.420
<v Speaker 1>ridiculousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between de prioritizing,</v>

214
00:09:22.421 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 1>believer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tweet hashtags and you know,</v>

215
00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 1>and using your status as the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important social media information</v>

216
00:09:30.361 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 1>company in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a believer.</v>

217
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And then I don't see your point bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went on twitter looking for what's</v>

218
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:38.220
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people are actually talking about.</v>

219
00:09:38.221 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about Justin fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>bieber.</v>

220

<v Speaker 1>You guys are banging each other.</v>

241
00:10:40.701 --> 00:10:44.190
<v Speaker 1>You cannot tell the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>your tattoo and just a facial blemish.</v>

242
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.310
<v Speaker 1>You've got the wrong tattoo dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>See what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he wants to be like one of those</v>

245
00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.150
<v Speaker 1>black guys like Birdman who has tattoos</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over his face.</v>

246
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She doesn't have that kind of balls.</v>

<v Speaker 1>tiny thing that you eventually get</v>

248
00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:58.980
<v Speaker 1>lasered off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen him know?</v>

253
00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the best.</v>

254
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.460
<v Speaker 1>As far as the worst as far as like if</v>

<v Speaker 1>you mean the worst person in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the best examples of.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got more tattoos.</v>

257
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's beautiful.</v>

258
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.950
<v Speaker 1>He's got them on his neck and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>forehead now.</v>

259
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.970
<v Speaker 1>And what is the coolest thing about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he's got like basically the joker,</v>

260
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.870
<v Speaker 1>a like scars coming out of the sides of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mouth that looked like they've got</v>

261
00:11:27.871 --> 00:11:28.860
<v Speaker 1>stitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence his name.</v>

262
00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Stitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Well even has it on his lips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like above his lips and to the sides and</v>

264
00:11:33.481 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 1>left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the latest thing that he's got?</v>

265
00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:39.300
<v Speaker 1>He's got a star on his face to the AK</v>
<v Speaker 1>47.</v>

266
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:40.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got to start.</v>

267
00:11:40.131 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 1>And where Justin Bieber has his little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his little mold.</v>

268
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.900
<v Speaker 1>That's the hotspot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sent me one of those.</v>

269
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 1>That's like the dumb dudes version of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower back tattoo.</v>

270
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like a tramp stamp or retards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

271
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>It's just the visibility</v>

272
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.990
<v Speaker 2>of it everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would.</v>

273
00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>That would freak me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a couple of tattoos,</v>

274
00:11:57.071 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 2>but they're not in places where I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>always going to be seen with them.</v>

275
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.180
<v Speaker 2>Not that it matters for Justin Bieber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like he's going to be going to</v>

276
00:12:02.181 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 2>a job interview and having to impress</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

277
00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.920
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but oh yeah,</v>

278
00:12:05.921 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 2>that's Gucci Mane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gucci Mane had an ice cream and an ice</v>

279
00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:12.290
<v Speaker 2>cream cone tattooed on his face with</v>
<v Speaker 2>lightening bolts and it says birth be</v>

280
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:16.780
<v Speaker 2>our our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know why that is?</v>

281
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:19.660
<v Speaker 2>And he also had some shit written under</v>
<v Speaker 2>his eyelids.</v>

282
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 2>What does that say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it say on his eyelids?</v>

283
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:24.560
<v Speaker 2>Looks like old egg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Looks like</v>

284
00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 2>a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ingenious that he's said that he's</v>

285
00:12:29.141 --> 00:12:33.130
<v Speaker 2>got borough written on the ice cream</v>
<v Speaker 2>because ice cream is cold and when</v>

286
00:12:33.131 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 2>people are called they say so see what</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's done there.</v>

287
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's combined the Woodburn,</v>

288
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:42.950
<v Speaker 2>but the visual iconography of an ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>cream by linking these two formally</v>

289
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 2>disparate concepts in one beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>tattoo.</v>

290
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.920
<v Speaker 2>How about the student copy them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got The guy next to him.</v>

291
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.020
<v Speaker 2>He'd copy Gucci Mane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's even stupider.</v>

292
00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He went with [inaudible].</v>

293
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.391
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

294
00:12:52.391 --> 00:12:56.500
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll get to my Gucci's runoff</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the diner and be like,</v>

295
00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:57.334
<v Speaker 2>Yo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gooch,</v>

296
00:12:58.050 --> 00:12:59.380
<v Speaker 2>they will stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't fuck.</v>

297
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The implications of a Justin bieber</v>

298
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:08.930
<v Speaker 2>being deprioritized on twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still contend template.</v>

299
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:11.020
<v Speaker 2>You're going back not as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as great</v>

300
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.700
<v Speaker 2>as the implications of Facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

301
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:19.520
<v Speaker 2>hiding conservative news stories from</v>
<v Speaker 2>its uses on its news feed.</v>

302
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.620
<v Speaker 2>It's very unfortunate that someone did</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

303
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's very important that the workers</v>
<v Speaker 2>told us that they did this.</v>

304
00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's supposed to be.</v>

305
00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be an impartial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess aggregator,</v>

306
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>

307
00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.570
<v Speaker 2>what would you call facebook?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a portal where doe for stories and</v>

308
00:13:36.571 --> 00:13:38.170
<v Speaker 2>things that are trending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've never,</v>

309
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.130
<v Speaker 2>they've never claimed that what you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just the most recent thing that is</v>

310
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:42.964
<v Speaker 2>coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

311
00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:46.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of it is algorithms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the things that you tend to click on</v>

312
00:13:46.081 --> 00:13:48.900
<v Speaker 2>and the things that you tend to look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the things that you tend to like and</v>

313
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:52.750
<v Speaker 2>the stories that you tend to click</v>
<v Speaker 2>through to all go into their gigantic</v>

314
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:55.300
<v Speaker 2>algorithm crunching machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just imagined as being like a</v>

315
00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:57.610
<v Speaker 2>big willy wonka machines with steam</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming up,</v>

316
00:13:57.611 --> 00:14:02.611
<v Speaker 2>pink steam coming out the top and</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little munchkin toy trains circling</v>

317
00:14:02.901 --> 00:14:03.734
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

318
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 2>You put in all of the data and then out</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other end of the Olympus compile</v>

319
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 2>your facebook feed and so they're making</v>
<v Speaker 2>judgments all the time about what</v>

320
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:15.400
<v Speaker 2>they're going to prioritize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they shouldn't be doing is</v>

321
00:14:15.401 --> 00:14:18.400
<v Speaker 2>including any kind of their own</v>
<v Speaker 2>political preferences and we don't yet</v>

322
00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>know if it's actually true or it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like this is one person who is</v>

323
00:14:21.581 --> 00:14:24.280
<v Speaker 2>saying this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

324
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Even if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you don't these kinds of</v>

325
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.020
<v Speaker 2>policies in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're a liberal.</v>

326
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.840
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what impact it's gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>have and whether or not.</v>

327
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.930
<v Speaker 2>By putting this stuff out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going to get more liberal.</v>

328
00:14:34.931 --> 00:14:37.990
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they'll get more frustrated with</v>
<v Speaker 2>liberal ideas and they'll become more</v>

329
00:14:37.991 --> 00:14:41.440
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more likely to be that it fuels the</v>

330
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:45.430
<v Speaker 2>idea that being a liberal is being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>person's detached from reality,</v>

331
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and that's one of the the the major</v>
<v Speaker 2>points of criticism.</v>

332
00:14:49.241 --> 00:14:49.641
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

333
00:14:49.641 --> 00:14:51.440
<v Speaker 2>when the conservative people go after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the liberals,</v>

334
00:14:51.441 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 2>one of the major</v>

335
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:57.280
<v Speaker 1>things that they try to harp on is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals are out of touch with reality.</v>

336
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.160
<v Speaker 1>When you have something like this and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're reinforcing the idea that there</v>

337
00:15:00.161 --> 00:15:02.510
<v Speaker 1>are shielding certain aspects of reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

338
00:15:02.511 --> 00:15:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Some people have these conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions and if some people have a</v>

339
00:15:05.931 --> 00:15:08.960
<v Speaker 1>conservative opinion and you disagree</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that conservative opinion,</v>

340
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:13.640
<v Speaker 1>that's where the open exchange and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace of ideas comes into place.</v>

341
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't allow that exchange take</v>

342
00:15:16.161 --> 00:15:20.000
<v Speaker 1>place because you deny that people think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way because you hide the stories</v>

343
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.920
<v Speaker 1>you're going to alienate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to create these</v>

344
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:25.100
<v Speaker 1>confirmation bias forums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to create these places</v>

345
00:15:25.101 --> 00:15:27.320
<v Speaker 1>where people like salon.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people just.</v>

346
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.140
<v Speaker 1>They agree with each other to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they tell you why.</v>

347
00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is Josh Zaps the worst?</v>

348
00:15:32.571 --> 00:15:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Will tell you why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they tell you.</v>

349
00:15:34.791 --> 00:15:38.270
<v Speaker 1>They ask a question like eight points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like eight reasons why justice is the</v>

350
00:15:38.271 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 1>worst.</v>

351
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Here's why he's terribly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd give you a dozen,</v>

352
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.210
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not news anymore.</v>

353
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:48.470
<v Speaker 1>There's so hysterically ridiculous is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the deep end.</v>

354
00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean it used to be the case that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of progressives and liberals as</v>

355
00:15:51.351 --> 00:15:53.600
<v Speaker 1>being more pro free speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least I did.</v>

356
00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:57.470
<v Speaker 1>I use the side of more inclusiveness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more tolerance and it's becoming</v>

357
00:15:57.471 --> 00:16:00.350
<v Speaker 1>increasingly not the case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there's more politically correct</v>

358
00:16:00.351 --> 00:16:02.780
<v Speaker 1>bullshit and most censorship and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposing,</v>

359
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 1>less tolerance of each of other people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas on the lift.</v>

360
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Even though they're on the run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

361
00:16:06.771 --> 00:16:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I 100 percent believed that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I believe it's the pendulum effect.</v>

362
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the suppression of free</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech by the Conservatives and the Bush</v>

363
00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:16.130
<v Speaker 1>administration that fuck people up so</v>
<v Speaker 1>sideways.</v>

364
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.470
<v Speaker 1>They bounce back the other way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultra hard.</v>

365
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I think people got so angry at what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with John Ashcroft covering</v>

366
00:16:23.091 --> 00:16:25.480
<v Speaker 1>statues up with drapes and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved that.</v>

367
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.770
<v Speaker 1>All the craziness that was going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that administration and all the</v>

368
00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:31.670
<v Speaker 1>suppression of gay rights as everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>know about that,</v>

369
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the fact that John Ashcroft actually had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the penis on a statue on an old Roman</v>

370
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 1>statue and she was like in one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great temples down in Washington DC</v>

371
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.320
<v Speaker 1>covered up because he was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>puritanical.</v>

372
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:48.830
<v Speaker 1>He didn't want a naked penis from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>agent statue.</v>

373
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.380
<v Speaker 1>He was disturbing that that guy got into</v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

374
00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:54.440
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys that uh,</v>

375
00:16:54.441 --> 00:16:59.441
<v Speaker 1>I correspond with online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had something to do with some record</v>

376
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:04.841
<v Speaker 1>store and he sent me an album of Gospel</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs that John Ashcroft had made with</v>

377
00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 1>some other dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking and probably still is bat</v>

378
00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:12.650
<v Speaker 1>shit crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

379
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

380
00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:15.350
<v Speaker 1>they kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it,</v>

381
00:17:15.351 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>like when you stack like that basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>stacked the Bush administration with a</v>

382
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:22.100
<v Speaker 1>lot of crazy people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the first,</v>

383
00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:25.330
<v Speaker 1>especially the first administration of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bush administration,</v>

384
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:28.640
<v Speaker 1>the 2000 man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at some of those paypal,</v>

385
00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.780
<v Speaker 1>they basically theocrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

386
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.650
<v Speaker 1>they're not that different from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian version of what the Iranian</v>

387
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.820
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

388
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:35.541
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

389
00:17:35.541 --> 00:17:39.410
<v Speaker 1>there's so caricature that they seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>like characters in a movie,</v>

390
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>like a bad action movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

391
00:17:41.631 --> 00:17:45.500
<v Speaker 1>you think about what you've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got Donald Rumsfeld and Dick</v>

392
00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Cheney to people arguably forged in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center of the earth.</v>

393
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're fucking</v>

394
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.930
<v Speaker 2>straight up evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

395
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Dick Cheney is straight up evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got to a point where he didn't have a</v>

396
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.140
<v Speaker 2>fucking heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

397
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean the guy had an artificial heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in which was pumping his blood</v>

398
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:03.230
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still have no power.</v>

399
00:18:03.231 --> 00:18:04.840
<v Speaker 2>You had a transplant it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

400
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.410
<v Speaker 2>does he have a live?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have found some dude and cut his fucking</v>

401
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:10.160
<v Speaker 2>heart out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Bet your ass they did with one stone</v>

402
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.560
<v Speaker 2>knives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to have a match your bullshit.</v>

403
00:18:13.561 --> 00:18:15.740
<v Speaker 2>You happen to have a met.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She knew that they would have killed</v>

404
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.520
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has some secret service agent</v>

405
00:18:17.521 --> 00:18:20.700
<v Speaker 2>disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One secret service agent and really</v>

406
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:24.990
<v Speaker 2>healthy diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking that guy open like a fish.</v>

407
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.540
<v Speaker 2>You can just imagine they've probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>got like a tinder for,</v>

408
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.790
<v Speaker 2>for Dick Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he's just swiping left and swiping</v>

409
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:32.310
<v Speaker 2>right on the people who they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>kill for his heart.</v>

410
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.420
<v Speaker 2>You got a 23 year old.</v>

411
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.210
<v Speaker 2>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He and Ashcroft and uh,</v>

412
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:39.750
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a whole bunch of them</v>

413
00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:42.810
<v Speaker 2>Wolfowitz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that guy looked like a demon,</v>

414
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

415
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:49.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of those fucking that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole administration was filled with</v>

416
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 2>chicken hawks that we're all about Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 2>and wanting to go over there and kick</v>

417
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:56.100
<v Speaker 2>some ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking blow shit up.</v>

418
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.490
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting you mentioned Wolfowitz</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in terms of like what was saying</v>

419
00:18:59.491 --> 00:19:02.370
<v Speaker 2>about the left is can be intolerant of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other ideas.</v>

420
00:19:02.371 --> 00:19:06.170
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially Wolfowitz with Forma Marxists</v>

421
00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:09.030
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Wolfowitz was young at university,</v>

422
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>he was a revolutionary Marxist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

423
00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's interesting that oftentimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who who are hypo revolutionary</v>

424
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:20.360
<v Speaker 2>socialists can flip into becoming hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Randian idealistic reaction raise.</v>

425
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.170
<v Speaker 2>And there's the same kind of like when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

426
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.340
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that different when you think</v>

427
00:19:26.341 --> 00:19:28.830
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people think of them as being ideas</v>

428
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:30.450
<v Speaker 2>that are at the end of the political</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectrum,</v>

429
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's excellent actually more like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>horseshoe,</v>

430
00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:33.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

431
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.160
<v Speaker 2>Where at one end you think that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>overthrow the capitalist system and</v>

432
00:19:38.161 --> 00:19:42.840
<v Speaker 2>create a utopia in which everyone is</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonna be be equal and it's going to be</v>

433
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:45.780
<v Speaker 2>from each according to his ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>each according to his need.</v>

434
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:50.190
<v Speaker 2>And then at the other end you believe</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can wipe society is clean,</v>

435
00:19:50.191 --> 00:19:53.460
<v Speaker 2>you can go into Iraq and raise</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and then start from fresh and</v>

436
00:19:53.461 --> 00:19:56.820
<v Speaker 2>democracy will spring up and people will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to live in pace.</v>

437
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're both basically kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mess niantic,</v>

438
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 2>Utopian ideas about change instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sort of change that I think actually</v>

439
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:06.780
<v Speaker 2>works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just incremental grudging</v>

440
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.900
<v Speaker 2>change bit by bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slowly Eking it out.</v>

441
00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not what Chaney and Wolfowitz</v>

442
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:13.740
<v Speaker 2>think the world is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

443
00:20:13.741 --> 00:20:17.490
<v Speaker 2>they tried to force change and force</v>
<v Speaker 2>change at home and abroad.</v>

444
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:21.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's where like the conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 2>theories come in about nine slash 11</v>

445
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 2>attacks and Dick Cheney saying that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>need something like an a</v>

446
00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Pearl Harbor and that's where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>really freak out because they look at</v>

447
00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:31.390
<v Speaker 3>how much people actually did profit from</v>
<v Speaker 3>that event.</v>

448
00:20:31.391 --> 00:20:31.901
<v Speaker 3>So they go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

449
00:20:31.901 --> 00:20:35.050
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that someone had a part</v>

450
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.880
<v Speaker 3>in letting that event happen or helping</v>
<v Speaker 3>that event happened or ignoring the fact</v>

451
00:20:39.881 --> 00:20:42.310
<v Speaker 3>that event was gonna happen and allowing</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to happen?</v>

452
00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:46.480
<v Speaker 3>Or is it a matter of people just</v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalizing on an event?</v>

453
00:20:46.481 --> 00:20:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Which is what the most logical point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>view is that they.</v>

454
00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:52.060
<v Speaker 3>There's incompetent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the event happened,</v>

455
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:54.670
<v Speaker 3>and then they capitalized on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like any good dictatorship.</v>

456
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

457
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think when you look at Helen</v>

458
00:20:57.610 --> 00:20:59.650
<v Speaker 2>competently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they managed Iraq.</v>

459
00:20:59.651 --> 00:21:02.140
<v Speaker 2>When you're looking at and competently</v>
<v Speaker 2>they managed Katrina.</v>

460
00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.960
<v Speaker 2>When you look at how and competently</v>
<v Speaker 2>they manage things that they wanted to</v>

461
00:21:04.961 --> 00:21:07.750
<v Speaker 2>get right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they could have pulled off</v>

462
00:21:07.751 --> 00:21:09.850
<v Speaker 2>something like that within eight months</v>
<v Speaker 2>of entering office.</v>

463
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:13.380
<v Speaker 2>I find implausible like whenever the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I have to choose between in</v>

464
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 2>competence versus a massive conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually think people are just</v>

465
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:18.550
<v Speaker 2>generally incompetent.</v>

466
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Then do you even start that</v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation?</v>

467
00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.110
<v Speaker 3>How do you even say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen here,</v>

468
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.570
<v Speaker 3>this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>before you get crazy here,</v>

469
00:21:25.571 --> 00:21:26.750
<v Speaker 3>the side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got an idea.</v>

470
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:32.590
<v Speaker 3>We got to talk some dudes into flying</v>
<v Speaker 3>planes into the world.</v>

471
00:21:33.171 --> 00:21:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Trade Center towers one and two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to hijack planes,</v>

472
00:21:35.871 --> 00:21:38.270
<v Speaker 3>fill with people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk these guys into</v>

473
00:21:38.271 --> 00:21:40.310
<v Speaker 3>flying them into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into the buildings.</v>

474
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:41.061
<v Speaker 3>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

475
00:21:41.061 --> 00:21:41.331
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

476
00:21:41.331 --> 00:21:41.651
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

477
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.890
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck is going to do that?</v>

478
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Religious people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to get them to believe that</v>

479
00:21:45.261 --> 00:21:47.690
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of posts he waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 3>them in heaven and all they have to do</v>

480
00:21:47.691 --> 00:21:49.490
<v Speaker 3>is fly these planes into buildings to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get that pussy.</v>

481
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:49.911
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

482
00:21:49.911 --> 00:21:50.391
<v Speaker 2>But see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

483
00:21:50.391 --> 00:21:52.930
<v Speaker 2>these plans had long been hatching as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were.</v>

484
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.700
<v Speaker 2>They were camps in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we will funding.</v>

485
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:59.410
<v Speaker 2>Is that your Alex Jones impression?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can feel it coming on with Alex Jones.</v>

486
00:22:00.430 --> 00:22:02.080
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alex Jones would be yelling at me right</v>

487
00:22:02.081 --> 00:22:03.340
<v Speaker 3>now explaining why I'm wrong.</v>

488
00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just.</v>

489
00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.440
<v Speaker 2>So there's a much easier way to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>done it,</v>

490
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.230
<v Speaker 2>which is if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted a pretext to go into Iraq</v>

491
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:13.520
<v Speaker 2>or you'd need to do would be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was talking to the national defense</v>

492
00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:14.520
<v Speaker 2>guy about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

493
00:22:14.521 --> 00:22:19.521
<v Speaker 2>there was a no fly zone over Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The CIA could have painted a US plane,</v>

494
00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:24.770
<v Speaker 2>the Iraqi colors and just faked a shoot</v>
<v Speaker 2>down a US or British jet that was</v>

495
00:22:25.411 --> 00:22:30.060
<v Speaker 2>patrolling the no fly zone and you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a clear much clearer case actually</v>

496
00:22:30.061 --> 00:22:33.870
<v Speaker 2>in international law to go to war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the vague case that they did do,</v>

497
00:22:33.871 --> 00:22:35.460
<v Speaker 2>because they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't connected to nine slash</v>

498
00:22:35.461 --> 00:22:36.810
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they have to make up this shit about</v>

499
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.020
<v Speaker 2>wmds and all that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could easily have orchestrated</v>

500
00:22:40.021 --> 00:22:41.760
<v Speaker 2>something without bringing down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world trade towers.</v>

501
00:22:41.761 --> 00:22:43.530
<v Speaker 2>That would have given you a good reason</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go into Iraq.</v>

502
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.560
<v Speaker 3>Well that was one of the main reasons</v>
<v Speaker 3>why a lot of people bought into.</v>

503
00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.220
<v Speaker 3>Do you know about operation northwoods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that story that's only heard</v>

504
00:22:52.221 --> 00:22:53.054
<v Speaker 3>you talk about it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

505
00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.510
<v Speaker 3>The operation northwoods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was that exact plan to get people</v>

506
00:22:56.511 --> 00:22:58.520
<v Speaker 3>to go to war with Cuba to get us excited</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

507
00:22:58.521 --> 00:23:00.470
<v Speaker 3>They were going to blow up in American</v>
<v Speaker 3>drone.</v>

508
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.230
<v Speaker 3>They were going to send a jetliner up in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the air with no one in it and shoot it</v>

509
00:23:03.231 --> 00:23:05.960
<v Speaker 3>out of the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were gonna arm,</v>

510
00:23:05.961 --> 00:23:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Cuban friendlies and attack Guantanamo</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bay.</v>

511
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.720
<v Speaker 3>That was the main idea behind it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like this would be the way we could get</v>

512
00:23:11.721 --> 00:23:16.040
<v Speaker 3>people excited about going to war with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuba because you know that whole Bay of</v>

513
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:19.350
<v Speaker 3>pigs and all that fucking disaster that</v>
<v Speaker 3>happened when Kennedy was in office.</v>

514
00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:20.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the missile crisis,</v>

515
00:23:20.721 --> 00:23:22.940
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of tension going on with</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cuba,</v>

516
00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.210
<v Speaker 3>so they had concocted this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called operation northwoods.</v>

517
00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.940
<v Speaker 3>It was signed by the Joint Chiefs of</v>
<v Speaker 3>staff,</v>

518
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:31.360
<v Speaker 3>so they went with it like there were</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

519
00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:35.090
<v Speaker 3>sounds like democracy and they let's</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking lie to people and blow shit</v>

520
00:23:35.091 --> 00:23:37.460
<v Speaker 3>up and kill Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were going to fucking kill</v>

521
00:23:37.461 --> 00:23:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Americans in Guantanamo Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

522
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:40.550
<v Speaker 3>you've been blaming on the cube.</v>

523
00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:43.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they have because they're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's such unscrupulous</v>

524
00:23:43.911 --> 00:23:46.820
<v Speaker 2>assholes and they do all of they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do these legitimate conspiracy</v>

525
00:23:46.821 --> 00:23:48.830
<v Speaker 2>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what gives people reasons to</v>

526
00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:51.470
<v Speaker 2>believe in the more than what I regard</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being that much more ridiculous</v>

527
00:23:51.471 --> 00:23:54.020
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it would be a lot better if they</v>

528
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:56.840
<v Speaker 2>just didn't do any of this shit in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first place and then people wouldn't be</v>

529
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 2>out of their minds being so suspicious</v>
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not nine slash 11 was</v>

530
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:00.230
<v Speaker 2>an inside job.</v>

531
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's also,</v>

532
00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.290
<v Speaker 3>there was the word that Dick Cheney was</v>
<v Speaker 3>discussing the possibility of doing</v>

533
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:09.170
<v Speaker 3>something like that for Iran before they</v>
<v Speaker 3>left office.</v>

534
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about orchestrating a</v>
<v Speaker 3>false flag on a ran before they left</v>

535
00:24:13.221 --> 00:24:17.660
<v Speaker 3>office and they never pulled it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whether or not it's true or not remains</v>

536
00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:19.790
<v Speaker 3>to be seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not outside the realm of</v>

537
00:24:19.791 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

538
00:24:20.691 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 3>it happened in so many different times</v>
<v Speaker 3>in history when Nero burned Rome,</v>

539
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.180
<v Speaker 3>when Hitler burned the Reichstag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I mean the whole.</v>

540
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.580
<v Speaker 3>What happened to get us into Vietnam?</v>

541
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.540
<v Speaker 2>Well that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the Gulf of Tonkin,</v>

542
00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Gulf of Tonkin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tended,</v>

543
00:24:35.431 --> 00:24:36.720
<v Speaker 2>we got shot at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

544
00:24:36.721 --> 00:24:39.100
<v Speaker 2>and there's also a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't even have to go as far as like</v>

545
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.310
<v Speaker 2>the Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just in terms of what the CIA has done,</v>

546
00:24:41.311 --> 00:24:44.640
<v Speaker 2>encounter up counterinsurgency</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations in south South America and</v>

547
00:24:44.641 --> 00:24:47.400
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The involvement in the coup in 1973 in</v>

548
00:24:47.401 --> 00:24:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was reading up about that lately</v>

549
00:24:49.351 --> 00:24:50.850
<v Speaker 2>because I went to Chile a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

550
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:56.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not that they absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely manufacture total bullshit</v>

551
00:24:56.251 --> 00:25:00.900
<v Speaker 2>from whole cloth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they give voice to conspiracy</v>

552
00:25:00.901 --> 00:25:05.460
<v Speaker 2>theories in those particular countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They fund a media outlets that are,</v>

553
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.610
<v Speaker 2>that are spreading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what the CIA wants to get hurt</v>

554
00:25:08.611 --> 00:25:11.370
<v Speaker 2>and they just basically put their finger</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the scales of something so that it</v>

555
00:25:11.371 --> 00:25:13.620
<v Speaker 2>goes another way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the democratically elected</v>

556
00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:17.220
<v Speaker 2>government in Chile was overthrown by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>brutal military dictatorship,</v>

557
00:25:17.221 --> 00:25:18.960
<v Speaker 2>which then lasted for an entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>generation.</v>

558
00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Thanks largely to the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't even think or hear or</v>

559
00:25:22.801 --> 00:25:26.610
<v Speaker 2>learn about that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you think that it's possible for</v>

560
00:25:26.611 --> 00:25:27.600
<v Speaker 2>them to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

561
00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:30.290
<v Speaker 2>you got to break some eggs to make an</v>
<v Speaker 2>omelet.</v>

562
00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:34.350
<v Speaker 2>You want America to be America led.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The free home of the brave was the only</v>

563
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:35.880
<v Speaker 2>one wig.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to fucking lie to you.</v>

564
00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.280
<v Speaker 3>We've got to kick some ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of shit we'd like to tell you,</v>

565
00:25:38.281 --> 00:25:40.770
<v Speaker 3>but the world works and really fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>way and you don't want to know about</v>

566
00:25:40.771 --> 00:25:42.360
<v Speaker 3>that because you want to watch real</v>
<v Speaker 3>housewives.</v>

567
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we're going to do now,</v>

568
00:25:43.871 --> 00:25:44.610
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

569
00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.140
<v Speaker 2>I actually have some sympathy for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>

570
00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a friend of a friend of mine was easily</v>

571
00:25:48.661 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 2>former director of the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a Thanksgiving with him once</v>

572
00:25:52.221 --> 00:25:54.210
<v Speaker 2>down in Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you look in his basement?</v>

573
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Tall skulls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open the doors sculptural out in the</v>

574
00:25:57.721 --> 00:26:00.810
<v Speaker 2>hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I talked to people like that,</v>

575
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do understand that our vision of the</v>

576
00:26:03.571 --> 00:26:08.400
<v Speaker 2>world is a very small sliver and can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite naive,</v>

577
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.590
<v Speaker 2>very naive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their attitude is when you're actually</v>

578
00:26:10.591 --> 00:26:12.600
<v Speaker 2>working in the national security</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparatus,</v>

579
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.740
<v Speaker 2>their apparatus apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might've made a word that'll do.</v>

580
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I just did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just showing you think he made up a</v>

581
00:26:19.201 --> 00:26:20.034
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it sounds.</v>

582
00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.010
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't just stop yourself,</v>

583
00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:26.130
<v Speaker 2>then the apparatus would be a new word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people at home would.</v>

584
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:28.690
<v Speaker 2>It went okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a smart guy.</v>

585
00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:32.790
<v Speaker 2>If you actually work there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I think your outlook is basically</v>

586
00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:34.560
<v Speaker 2>what you just articulated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

587
00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:35.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

588
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:38.880
<v Speaker 2>it'll be lovely if we all lived in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>world where with ice cream and candy and</v>

589
00:26:38.881 --> 00:26:40.940
<v Speaker 2>where the lines slipped with the lambs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

590
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:43.530
<v Speaker 2>and the postman hug the dogs and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>all dancing the streets.</v>

591
00:26:43.531 --> 00:26:46.590
<v Speaker 2>But listen Honcho,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a tough world out there and either</v>

592
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:48.830
<v Speaker 2>the Saddam Hussein's and the Putin's are</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to roll it away.</v>

593
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.240
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you have to break a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks in order to make an Omelette.</v>

594
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes you have to do things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

595
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that might not seem pretty on the</v>

596
00:26:54.241 --> 00:26:55.980
<v Speaker 2>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'll tell you what were the ones who</v>

597
00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:59.550
<v Speaker 2>are standing on the wall watching God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you go about your business and we'll</v>

598
00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:01.850
<v Speaker 2>take care of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard the national anthem playing.</v>

599
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.910
<v Speaker 2>You really did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which won the Australian one.</v>

600
00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's cruise on?</v>

601
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.180
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

602
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even American.</v>

603
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:19.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably Canadian or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barely America.</v>

604
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.390
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

605
00:27:20.391 --> 00:27:21.680
<v Speaker 2>The beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be the national anthem.</v>

606
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Can I just say that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's better.</v>

607
00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.080
<v Speaker 2>Stop bangled banner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start rockets in it though.</v>

608
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to probably stick with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rockets.</v>

609
00:27:29.811 --> 00:27:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Red Glare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bombs bursting in air.</v>

610
00:27:34.101 --> 00:27:39.101
<v Speaker 2>What you bombs bursting in air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's in our fucking national anthem.</v>

611
00:27:39.661 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I love how warmongering so many national</v>
<v Speaker 2>anthems.</v>

612
00:27:42.301 --> 00:27:43.850
<v Speaker 2>And I like the French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The French one.</v>

613
00:27:43.851 --> 00:27:48.770
<v Speaker 2>It literally has the lyrics about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood of our enemies will fill the</v>

614
00:27:48.771 --> 00:27:51.770
<v Speaker 2>canals of France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's serious shit.</v>

615
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.700
<v Speaker 2>That's unrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People you have to call you just.</v>

616
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:56.690
<v Speaker 2>You guys are just lying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no happened.</v>

617
00:27:56.810 --> 00:28:01.810
<v Speaker 2>Bombs actually could burst in there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do and have doubled the canals fucker.</v>

618
00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:05.810
<v Speaker 2>You killing man killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you'd have to kill everybody on the</v>

619
00:28:05.811 --> 00:28:07.130
<v Speaker 2>planet to fill the canals of blood.</v>

620
00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:08.840
<v Speaker 2>It'd be no one left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

621
00:28:08.841 --> 00:28:10.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean I killed a lot of Germans in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gym.</v>

622
00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Is killed a lot of Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen some of the numbers?</v>

623
00:28:13.011 --> 00:28:16.160
<v Speaker 2>There's a great graphic that I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>like vox produced or something about the</v>

624
00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:18.440
<v Speaker 2>number of people in total who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed in,</v>

625
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>in the world wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each one represented like each thousand</v>

626
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.150
<v Speaker 2>dollars million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's represented by little block.</v>

627
00:28:23.151 --> 00:28:24.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

628
00:28:24.681 --> 00:28:28.010
<v Speaker 2>but it's just crazy when you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing how many people look at you.</v>

629
00:28:28.011 --> 00:28:28.341
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

630
00:28:28.341 --> 00:28:30.620
<v Speaker 2>this is a lot who were killed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

631
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.860
<v Speaker 2>Iraq war and it goes back to Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

632
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:37.810
<v Speaker 2>what will one world war two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the towards the final few years will</v>

633
00:28:37.811 --> 00:28:42.260
<v Speaker 2>will to even excluding the Holocaust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just looking at people like mainly</v>

634
00:28:42.261 --> 00:28:47.261
<v Speaker 2>Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which she asked state just millions upon</v>

635
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.380
<v Speaker 2>millions upon millions of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 20 million people don't think</v>

636
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.330
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russians have died in World War II.</v>

637
00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.130
<v Speaker 2>There was a lot more of them died than</v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

638
00:28:55.131 --> 00:28:57.830
<v Speaker 2>And often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you talk to a military</v>

639
00:28:57.831 --> 00:29:00.290
<v Speaker 2>historian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what really ended the war?</v>

640
00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:01.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dj was important.</v>

641
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.530
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Soviets won the war,</v>

642
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the fact that the Nazis were just</v>

643
00:29:05.871 --> 00:29:09.560
<v Speaker 2>hemorrhaging in the east.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That meant that they couldn't put up any</v>

644
00:29:09.561 --> 00:29:10.940
<v Speaker 2>defenses in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the West.</v>

645
00:29:10.941 --> 00:29:12.170
<v Speaker 2>So Dj was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

646
00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:15.410
<v Speaker 2>not to insult the are great forefathers</v>
<v Speaker 2>who fought there,</v>

647
00:29:15.411 --> 00:29:17.780
<v Speaker 2>but data was a little bit of a walk in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the park in comparison to what was</v>

648
00:29:17.781 --> 00:29:18.650
<v Speaker 2>happening on the eastern front.</v>

649
00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.920
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot going on all across the</v>

650
00:29:20.921 --> 00:29:23.920
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one of the scariest things about</v>

651
00:29:23.921 --> 00:29:28.750
<v Speaker 3>France and what happened to them during</v>
<v Speaker 3>World War II is the amount of France to</v>

652
00:29:28.751 --> 00:29:33.751
<v Speaker 3>this day that you literally can't even</v>
<v Speaker 3>visit because it's so filled with waste</v>

653
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:39.100
<v Speaker 3>from all the bombs that were dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You seen as an area larger than Paris</v>

654
00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:44.280
<v Speaker 3>that's completely fenced in and can't go</v>
<v Speaker 3>in it because it's got so much munitions</v>

655
00:29:44.531 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 3>and so many bombs that were dropped</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

656
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.480
<v Speaker 3>It's so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That will be that way for something like</v>

657
00:29:49.481 --> 00:29:51.550
<v Speaker 3>100,000 years or something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

658
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 3>it's poison gas</v>

659
00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.750
<v Speaker 2>bodies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just still buddies,</v>

660
00:29:55.751 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 2>just bones and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this little town in northern</v>

661
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 2>France called villas retina where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>aussies were,</v>

662
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:01.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

663
00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.600
<v Speaker 2>no one ever thinks about the [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then using this little countries who</v>

664
00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:06.700
<v Speaker 2>were fighting there as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of course they had their own little</v>

665
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.630
<v Speaker 2>little plots that they had to had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight and there was this big heroic</v>

666
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:13.780
<v Speaker 2>stand against the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which the aussies were in charge of it</v>

667
00:30:13.781 --> 00:30:17.890
<v Speaker 2>villas retina and still to this day in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little in the schools and the</v>

668
00:30:17.891 --> 00:30:20.020
<v Speaker 2>elementary schools there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they sing the Australian national</v>

669
00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:22.540
<v Speaker 2>anthem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have little Australian flags flying</v>

670
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:24.940
<v Speaker 2>and stuff because they have failed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>just littered with the bodies of</v>

671
00:30:24.941 --> 00:30:28.840
<v Speaker 2>Australians in northern France from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world war.</v>

672
00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

673
00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Naughty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What will we do it than to make any</v>

674
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 2>sense of the side of the world should</v>
<v Speaker 2>have just stayed home?</v>

675
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we saw some of those Hitler</v>

676
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:37.870
<v Speaker 3>speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One went,</v>

677
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:40.300
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have to do something.</v>

678
00:30:40.301 --> 00:30:43.000
<v Speaker 3>Here is this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this Guy Mike.</v>

679
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.970
<v Speaker 3>He might have the right stuff to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>become the real darth vader.</v>

680
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

681
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:47.610
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

682
00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.640
<v Speaker 3>that charismatic person who's completely</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane that wants to conquer the world</v>

683
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:54.430
<v Speaker 3>and gets a whole nation behind them is</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Donald Trump,</v>

684
00:30:54.431 --> 00:30:56.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so crazy and scary</v>

685
00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.770
<v Speaker 3>will where he's not trying to take over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>

686
00:31:02.771 --> 00:31:07.771
<v Speaker 3>but it shows you how problematic</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality can be when it comes to</v>

687
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:14.020
<v Speaker 3>someone being chosen to be the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially to this day and in this day</v>

688
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:18.430
<v Speaker 3>rather were so soft this day of food</v>
<v Speaker 3>coming on these little styrofoam trays</v>

689
00:31:18.431 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 3>and being able to pull up to Wendy's and</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a fucking cheeseburger and 15</v>

690
00:31:21.611 --> 00:31:25.810
<v Speaker 3>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so weak and it's so easy to exist</v>

691
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:31.050
<v Speaker 3>that we're excited about this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibly like overturned the apple cart</v>

692
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:32.343
<v Speaker 3>where people are</v>

693
00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.170
<v Speaker 2>who don't have any people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have any other options as well.</v>

694
00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:39.350
<v Speaker 2>I feel like Bernie and trump with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a ways in different ways that</v>

695
00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.920
<v Speaker 2>people had the people who've been on it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>

696
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.380
<v Speaker 2>White working class dudes mostly have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

697
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you look at the effect that</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle incomes of middle American has</v>

698
00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:55.810
<v Speaker 2>been stagnating for the past 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manufacturing has been in decline like</v>

699
00:31:55.811 --> 00:31:58.060
<v Speaker 2>they haven't been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There hasn't been a rise in working</v>

700
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:00.910
<v Speaker 2>class incomes in America since the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties.</v>

701
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.450
<v Speaker 3>I was surprised that Elizabeth Warren</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't get more traction.</v>

702
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.870
<v Speaker 3>It seems like once that native American</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff came out about her,</v>

703
00:32:07.871 --> 00:32:09.060
<v Speaker 3>she just went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Kim,</v>

704
00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 3>just kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They think she believes that she is more</v>

705
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:13.840
<v Speaker 3>useful in the Senate maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

706
00:32:13.841 --> 00:32:18.280
<v Speaker 3>the native American stuff where she</v>
<v Speaker 3>faked a native American heritage in</v>

707
00:32:18.281 --> 00:32:20.320
<v Speaker 3>order to get some sort of a scholarship.</v>

708
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:22.470
<v Speaker 2>When I hear things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use my brain.</v>

709
00:32:22.471 --> 00:32:25.650
<v Speaker 2>It just hits the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is probably a btob part of my brain</v>

710
00:32:25.651 --> 00:32:27.570
<v Speaker 2>and it just goes straight out my ear</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I don't.</v>

711
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:28.890
<v Speaker 2>I don't really give a shit about that.</v>

712
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 3>Stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't care about someone faking</v>

713
00:32:31.031 --> 00:32:33.670
<v Speaker 3>their ethnicity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't I didn't look into it enough.</v>

714
00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.030
<v Speaker 3>Me I</v>

715
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.820
<v Speaker 2>needed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a brilliant woman.</v>

716
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:37.191
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

717
00:32:37.191 --> 00:32:38.210
<v Speaker 2>Why was she doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

718
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.000
<v Speaker 2>wanted to get into a university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She have to go</v>

719
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.020
<v Speaker 1>pull that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>

720
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Find out what the fuck that was all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

721
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.350
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

722
00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:48.080
<v Speaker 1>who knows if she actually did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe someone else did it and she sort</v>

723
00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 1>of went with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So difficult to talking to her.</v>

724
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 1>If it's a Rachel dolezal thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who spent their whole life</v>

725
00:32:54.621 --> 00:32:56.120
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be something that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

726
00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 1>then I think yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a quite a few of those out</v>

727
00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.350
<v Speaker 1>there though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I,</v>

728
00:32:59.351 --> 00:33:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I do think that that's disqualifying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like if the only thing that</v>

729
00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:06.560
<v Speaker 1>you'll political opponents can dig up on</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is that you filled out a form wrong,</v>

730
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's not filling out a form wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's being deceptive about your</v>

731
00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:14.540
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity in order to take advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that are undermined by</v>

732
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:16.040
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

733
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.080
<v Speaker 1>when you go with your ranking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's kill her</v>

734
00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.370
<v Speaker 1>to put her into trump's concentration.</v>

735
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.170
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

736
00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:30.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump isn't,</v>

737
00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.170
<v Speaker 1>is fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

738
00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe it's actually going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

739
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.470
<v Speaker 1>He might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

740
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.870
<v Speaker 1>he's real close to winning because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't know whether or not Hillary</v>

741
00:33:38.871 --> 00:33:41.990
<v Speaker 1>can hold up to scrutiny when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about her being under to</v>

742
00:33:41.991 --> 00:33:44.690
<v Speaker 1>criminal investigations and the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

743
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immediate future,</v>

744
00:33:45.981 --> 00:33:47.510
<v Speaker 1>this to criminal investigations going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

745
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:51.140
<v Speaker 1>they just gave immunity to the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up that email server.</v>

746
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.330
<v Speaker 1>They deported him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They brought him over to America.</v>

747
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Extra added them wanting to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that called?</v>

748
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:59.810
<v Speaker 1>They brought them over to America and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave him immunity.</v>

749
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.770
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

750
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.260
<v Speaker 1>what is gonna Happen Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

751
00:34:03.261 --> 00:34:04.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are one.</v>

752
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to a guy hacked it rather</v>

753
00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:09.113
<v Speaker 1>immunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

754
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to body laying on the,</v>

755
00:34:11.521 --> 00:34:12.850
<v Speaker 1>on my podcast about them.</v>

756
00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

757
00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.940
<v Speaker 1>They give immunity to go set up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>server.</v>

758
00:34:16.941 --> 00:34:19.700
<v Speaker 1>The extradited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy who created the hack that he</v>

759
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have immunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think I hacked?</v>

760
00:34:21.651 --> 00:34:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I think he's from Romania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coolest,</v>

761
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:24.890
<v Speaker 1>coolest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's from Romania.</v>

762
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:28.520
<v Speaker 1>The Guy who hacked into the serve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the email servers and exposed all that.</v>

763
00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I want to say he's from a very small</v>
<v Speaker 1>rural town in Romania.</v>

764
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if that's not true,</v>

765
00:34:33.861 --> 00:34:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I liked that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that image of him just in a shed,</v>

766
00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:39.830
<v Speaker 1>in a bond in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And icy cold remaining true though.</v>

767
00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Romania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucifer?</v>

768
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I breached Clinton server.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was easy.</v>

769
00:34:44.151 --> 00:34:45.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy,</v>

770
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:49.370
<v Speaker 1>he got arrested and he's in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the guy was set up the actual server</v>

771
00:34:49.371 --> 00:34:50.001
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

772
00:34:50.001 --> 00:34:52.700
<v Speaker 1>which is in her bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

773
00:34:52.701 --> 00:34:54.620
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you put a server in your</v>

774
00:34:54.621 --> 00:34:55.454
<v Speaker 1>bathroom?</v>

775
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:56.151
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

776
00:34:56.151 --> 00:34:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that guy got immunity in this guy</v>

777
00:34:59.181 --> 00:35:03.350
<v Speaker 1>got so frustratingly paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if there was nothing,</v>

778
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:07.730
<v Speaker 1>even if she wasn't doing anything wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that she's so paranoid as to</v>

779
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:11.090
<v Speaker 1>need to set that up because she's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified that someone's going to get</v>

780
00:35:11.091 --> 00:35:12.410
<v Speaker 1>access to our emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

781
00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spent a million dollars to fight</v>

782
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:17.780
<v Speaker 1>off social media opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know about this?</v>

783
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Pax correct commenters on Reddit and</v>

784
00:35:23.001 --> 00:35:25.850
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A million dollars to spend a million</v>

785
00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:28.550
<v Speaker 1>dollars to fight off people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Clinton.</v>

786
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're what they're doing as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trend of engineer public support,</v>

787
00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.160
<v Speaker 1>public support that Bernie sanders has</v>
<v Speaker 1>got organically.</v>

788
00:35:34.161 --> 00:35:34.994
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be.</v>

789
00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Trump has organically too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we don't</v>

790
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.670
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

791
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.530
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he does,</v>

792
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.530
<v Speaker 2>what he does have is even people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate him,</v>

793
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:45.930
<v Speaker 2>acknowledged that he is not full of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit and that he's not being.</v>

794
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:49.440
<v Speaker 2>He's not spending someone else's lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't seem manufactured.</v>

795
00:35:49.441 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 2>He's obviously not 100 conventional</v>
<v Speaker 2>politician.</v>

796
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.960
<v Speaker 2>I can dislike all of his policies as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as I do,</v>

797
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:57.270
<v Speaker 2>but I can still regard him as being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>breath of fresh air.</v>

798
00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.590
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like his policies.</v>

799
00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:02.760
<v Speaker 2>What about the wall?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Wall's great idea.</v>

800
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Are you a big pink floyd fan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a pink floyd fan.</v>

801
00:36:06.690 --> 00:36:09.060
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the wall is the craziest</v>

802
00:36:09.061 --> 00:36:12.060
<v Speaker 2>of is even close to his craziest of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas.</v>

803
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean the craziest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keeping Muslims out of the country and</v>

804
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:17.550
<v Speaker 2>probably not allowing any noncitizen</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims into the United States.</v>

805
00:36:17.551 --> 00:36:21.810
<v Speaker 2>This is not only crazy but incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous because I think that if we</v>

806
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:26.160
<v Speaker 2>want to be able to conquer a Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam and jihadism,</v>

807
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.400
<v Speaker 2>Islamic terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to find a way of.</v>

808
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:32.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean our best resources and moderate</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims inside the United States,</v>

809
00:36:32.821 --> 00:36:33.654
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who can,</v>

810
00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 2>who have their ear to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who will notice mosques that might be</v>

811
00:36:37.531 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 2>becoming radicalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to appear to be a friendly,</v>

812
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:45.120
<v Speaker 2>tolerant democracy and of course you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to put in place all the security</v>

813
00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:48.360
<v Speaker 2>precautions that unnecessarily and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to just be allowing millions</v>

814
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:50.820
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of unscreened people to come pouring in</v>

815
00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:53.460
<v Speaker 2>the way that they have in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we don't have that problem here</v>

816
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:58.170
<v Speaker 2>because we've got ocean between us so we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can pick and choose who was also why it</v>

817
00:36:58.171 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 2>gets really weird when you start talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the CIA and the CIA infiltrating</v>

818
00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:05.820
<v Speaker 2>different organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's where you kind of</v>

819
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:08.970
<v Speaker 2>support it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda support clan to Stein behavior and</v>

820
00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:11.400
<v Speaker 2>sneakiness and deception because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

821
00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:13.830
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing it for a long time</v>

822
00:37:13.831 --> 00:37:17.490
<v Speaker 2>and they know how to get deep into</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizations.</v>

823
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:19.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you ever see the show homeland.</v>

824
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on Bro.</v>

825
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made a documentary.</v>

826
00:37:23.170 --> 00:37:25.060
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

827
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:28.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea of a wall to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I come from a country Australia</v>

828
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:30.030
<v Speaker 2>which is surrounded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an island.</v>

829
00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 2>So like of course there are not that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the idea of people just pouring</v>

830
00:37:33.661 --> 00:37:38.580
<v Speaker 2>across the border back and forth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in for seasonal seasonal work and</v>

831
00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.730
<v Speaker 2>like that to me does strike me as as</v>
<v Speaker 2>odd.</v>

832
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a.</v>

833
00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.060
<v Speaker 2>there's an undefended border.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

834
00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:48.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it would be a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>investment of money.</v>

835
00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it's silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a distraction.</v>

836
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.830
<v Speaker 2>If you talk to technology experts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say that there are much better ways</v>

837
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.350
<v Speaker 2>of securing the border than with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical wall.</v>

838
00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:00.000
<v Speaker 2>You can have drones and things and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can have all kinds of crazy shit,</v>

839
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:03.580
<v Speaker 2>but because people will dig under a wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the climate over,</v>

840
00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:04.440
<v Speaker 2>well it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

841
00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.170
<v Speaker 2>It's not nearly as sophisticated as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of technology that you could use,</v>

842
00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:11.070
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think there's anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>inherently like bigoted about it.</v>

843
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I think deporting every single person</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's here illegally is an overreaction</v>

844
00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:18.270
<v Speaker 2>and that like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you seen the stats about how many</v>

845
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.250
<v Speaker 2>seven?</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 seven is full of people.</v>

846
00:38:20.251 --> 00:38:25.170
<v Speaker 2>You would need to get all of all 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>million undocumented people in America.</v>

847
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.200
<v Speaker 2>There's more than 11 million in la by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>

848
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.560
<v Speaker 2>this idea that there's 11 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>undocumented people in America,</v>

849
00:38:31.561 --> 00:38:33.670
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four,</v>

850
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.490
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five at three the afternoon and look</v>

851
00:38:36.491 --> 00:38:41.180
<v Speaker 2>around because there's fucking millions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and millions of people that are broken</v>

852
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:44.470
<v Speaker 2>that are from Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people from Mexico,</v>

853
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.440
<v Speaker 2>millions of people from all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>spots that aren't supposed to be here.</v>

854
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:50.780
<v Speaker 2>That God visas and stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit is rampant.</v>

855
00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I know the bloody ozzy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not to mention Monica,</v>

856
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:57.570
<v Speaker 2>if you guys don't let anybody in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia either,</v>

857
00:38:57.571 --> 00:39:00.140
<v Speaker 2>like boatloads of people that try to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>come in legally,</v>

858
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 2>that's spinning around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>light them on fire and push them out to</v>

859
00:39:02.861 --> 00:39:06.340
<v Speaker 2>the ocean</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people don't fucking play over</v>

860
00:39:06.341 --> 00:39:06.590
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

861
00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Australia Australia's policy has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the eighties that uh,</v>

862
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.600
<v Speaker 2>you have a heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very high level of legal migration in</v>

863
00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:16.480
<v Speaker 2>a high level of refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Refugee intake,</v>

864
00:39:16.481 --> 00:39:20.050
<v Speaker 2>like on a per capita basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia is one of certainly the top 10</v>

865
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:23.020
<v Speaker 2>most generous countries in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people coming in and more than half of</v>

866
00:39:23.021 --> 00:39:25.390
<v Speaker 2>the population of Australia has arrived</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the Second World War.</v>

867
00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

868
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.520
<v Speaker 2>So it's actually a higher immigrant</v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion country than the United</v>

869
00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.550
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if you do it legally,</v>

870
00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.450
<v Speaker 2>if you do it legally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we have this quite controversial and</v>

871
00:39:34.451 --> 00:39:38.710
<v Speaker 2>pretty inhumane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I suppose defensible policy,</v>

872
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:42.220
<v Speaker 2>which is if you pay a people smuggler to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make your way all the way from</v>

873
00:39:42.221 --> 00:39:46.000
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan or Iran or wherever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're coming from Syria and you pass</v>

874
00:39:46.001 --> 00:39:48.970
<v Speaker 2>through a bazillion other different</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries through Malaysia,</v>

875
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.520
<v Speaker 2>through Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make your way down to Indonesia and</v>

876
00:39:51.521 --> 00:39:52.720
<v Speaker 2>you're rich enough to get on a boat.</v>

877
00:39:53.130 --> 00:39:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Then comes to Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will never be settled in Australia.</v>

878
00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ever,</v>

879
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:58.360
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever,</v>

880
00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.810
<v Speaker 2>never accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'll be sent to a one of a couple</v>

881
00:40:01.811 --> 00:40:04.270
<v Speaker 2>of Pacific island nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a place called Manus island in</v>

882
00:40:04.271 --> 00:40:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Papua New Guinea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

883
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.350
<v Speaker 2>There's another place called Naru,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a country in its own right,</v>

884
00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:12.970
<v Speaker 2>and they have set up these big detention</v>
<v Speaker 2>centers there and people can end up</v>

885
00:40:12.971 --> 00:40:15.790
<v Speaker 2>there for years or even decades while</v>
<v Speaker 2>their cases get heard.</v>

886
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:18.580
<v Speaker 2>It's really barbaric people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they're fucking lips together in</v>

887
00:40:18.581 --> 00:40:20.650
<v Speaker 2>protest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One guy just set himself on fire in</v>

888
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.480
<v Speaker 2>front of United Nations inspectors who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were there.</v>

889
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.360
<v Speaker 2>It's really not pretty stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the government says,</v>

890
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to have under the law,</v>

891
00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:29.860
<v Speaker 2>under the previous government which</v>
<v Speaker 2>relaxed these policies.</v>

892
00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 2>50,000 people died at sea trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Australia in boats,</v>

893
00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:36.070
<v Speaker 2>including women and children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now almost nobody tries to come to</v>

894
00:40:36.071 --> 00:40:38.380
<v Speaker 2>Australia by boat anymore because they</v>
<v Speaker 2>know they're never going to settle,</v>

895
00:40:38.590 --> 00:40:39.520
<v Speaker 2>so what do you prefer?</v>

896
00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:44.200
<v Speaker 2>A few hundred people basically being</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuck in indefinite detention on some</v>

897
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:48.370
<v Speaker 2>shitty Pacific island or 50,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying at sea trying to get here because</v>

898
00:40:48.371 --> 00:40:49.480
<v Speaker 2>they think they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>resettled.</v>

899
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.560
<v Speaker 2>Plus Australia remains awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where it gets weird.</v>

900
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:58.120
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fucking bad ass there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're trying to like look at the</v>

901
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.450
<v Speaker 2>end result might go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

902
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:03.130
<v Speaker 2>the result might justify the means</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like go to Melbourne.</v>

903
00:41:03.131 --> 00:41:04.480
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

904
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.530
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

905
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this thing about Australia that</v>

906
00:41:09.581 --> 00:41:10.890
<v Speaker 2>to me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

907
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 2>they might have it nailed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only 20 million people in the</v>

908
00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:16.390
<v Speaker 2>entire country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking huge country.</v>

909
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.690
<v Speaker 2>The landscape is gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have any ozone layer though.</v>

910
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:20.890
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>

911
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.920
<v Speaker 2>You Get Sun burnt and you get cancer</v>
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

912
00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know Australia has 23 million people,</v>

913
00:41:26.561 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 2>so what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>About half the population of California.</v>

914
00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.550
<v Speaker 2>California is about $40.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's La.</v>

915
00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the greater the greater la area if</v>

916
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:35.270
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you include all the way up through</v>

917
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:35.561
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

918
00:41:35.561 --> 00:41:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And down to down to long beach and all</v>

919
00:41:37.221 --> 00:41:38.620
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

920
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:41.900
<v Speaker 2>and that's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in an area the same size as the</v>

921
00:41:41.901 --> 00:41:44.150
<v Speaker 2>contiguous United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>

922
00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.920
<v Speaker 2>And everybody lives in the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

923
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:50.370
<v Speaker 2>the middle one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The middle of crocodiles and Lizard.</v>

924
00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Kangaroos and nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

925
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:54.190
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

926
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.080
<v Speaker 2>But Canada is kind of like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada's only got 35 million people and</v>

927
00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:59.330
<v Speaker 2>it's bigger than the United States even</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Alaska,</v>

928
00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.620
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking frozen my good time yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the site of Canada and Australia.</v>

929
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Kind of very similar in that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous,</v>

930
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 2>but totally in hospitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

931
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:10.400
<v Speaker 2>you could know sooner live in most parts</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Canada,</v>

932
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:13.250
<v Speaker 2>then you could live in most parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia where there's just no water</v>

933
00:42:13.251 --> 00:42:16.010
<v Speaker 2>and no vegetation in Australia was</v>
<v Speaker 2>desert Canada is ice,</v>

934
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.630
<v Speaker 2>not really icy.</v>

935
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Probably be better off trying Australia</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you would see I'm going to try and</v>

936
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you would Australia definitely.</v>

937
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Well you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get water,</v>

938
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:27.470
<v Speaker 2>you could make fires and stuff pulling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's no water you're screwed.</v>

939
00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a lot of people that live</v>

940
00:42:29.421 --> 00:42:30.950
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have some friends that live in</v>

941
00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Alberta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They live way up there.</v>

942
00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.230
<v Speaker 2>They live in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking cold shit.</v>

943
00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.940
<v Speaker 2>The wintertime up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like 30,</v>

944
00:42:37.941 --> 00:42:38.840
<v Speaker 2>40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>below zero.</v>

945
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they live there.</v>

946
00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 2>They're fine</v>
<v Speaker 2>with modern civilization I suppose.</v>

947
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:45.903
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

948
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.780
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best writer in Kennedy is,</v>

949
00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:49.550
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all huddle along a very,</v>

950
00:42:49.551 --> 00:42:53.120
<v Speaker 2>very narrow strip in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the coast and in Canada it's the</v>

951
00:42:53.121 --> 00:42:53.780
<v Speaker 2>border.</v>

952
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.380
<v Speaker 3>Don't you think it's easier though to</v>
<v Speaker 3>live in a cold climate then in</v>

953
00:42:57.381 --> 00:42:59.870
<v Speaker 3>hospitably hot climate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you could dress for a cold</v>

954
00:42:59.871 --> 00:43:02.800
<v Speaker 3>climate who can get in your car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you drive around you all right?</v>

955
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 3>You get in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's warm,</v>

956
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:08.930
<v Speaker 3>but hot climates are fucking scary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it gets too hot to survive outside</v>

957
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:10.460
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's waste,</v>

958
00:43:10.461 --> 00:43:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you can't dress for it.</v>

959
00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 3>Like you could wear like really</v>
<v Speaker 3>insulated close and you can actually</v>

960
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:18.820
<v Speaker 3>stand outside at 10 below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you grew up in the northeast.</v>

961
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:21.410
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're outside and it's 130</v>

962
00:43:21.411 --> 00:43:23.120
<v Speaker 3>degrees outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're fuck.</v>

963
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I feel like this is just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This just comes from what you're used</v>

964
00:43:25.781 --> 00:43:27.100
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I reckon because you grew up in the</v>

965
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.880
<v Speaker 2>northeast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not as scared of the call.</v>

966
00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:30.501
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

967
00:43:30.501 --> 00:43:32.920
<v Speaker 2>I find like when I first moved to New</v>
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>

968
00:43:32.921 --> 00:43:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I remember saying to people back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

969
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:38.520
<v Speaker 2>why is there even a city here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

970
00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:43.090
<v Speaker 2>Why did anyone ever come across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean and build a fucking city here</v>

971
00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.920
<v Speaker 2>where it's literally so cold that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>dog's piss on the sidewalk will turn</v>

972
00:43:47.921 --> 00:43:49.540
<v Speaker 2>into ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

973
00:43:49.541 --> 00:43:51.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I'm in the TV show the dome</v>

974
00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:55.090
<v Speaker 2>and it's just a giant freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I'd never had the conception of</v>

975
00:43:55.091 --> 00:43:58.600
<v Speaker 2>actually being sub freezing like shit is</v>
<v Speaker 2>just freezing.</v>

976
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:02.320
<v Speaker 2>You should not be living anywhere where</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you fell over drunk at night and hit</v>

977
00:44:02.321 --> 00:44:04.510
<v Speaker 2>your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be dead by the morning.</v>

978
00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.110
<v Speaker 2>But then again we get rid of some</v>
<v Speaker 2>dummies.</v>

979
00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:12.760
<v Speaker 3>Should we send her a little bit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know if you're falling asleep out in</v>

980
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.210
<v Speaker 3>the street drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's sad when that happens to</v>

981
00:44:15.211 --> 00:44:16.770
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear about it with like college</v>

982
00:44:16.771 --> 00:44:17.820
<v Speaker 3>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they freeze to death.</v>

983
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:21.660
<v Speaker 3>That happens like every other year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So some college kid in New Hampshire</v>

984
00:44:21.661 --> 00:44:24.090
<v Speaker 3>will get drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fall asleep outside and freeze to death.</v>

985
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:25.690
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be living there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it.</v>

986
00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:30.130
<v Speaker 2>Move all of Canada and the North East</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the mid Atlantic states and be</v>

987
00:44:30.131 --> 00:44:31.470
<v Speaker 2>done with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not though.</v>

988
00:44:31.471 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 2>If you have warm</v>

989
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.020
<v Speaker 3>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have warm clothes you could</v>

990
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:35.640
<v Speaker 3>survive up there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that bad.</v>

991
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you have air conditioning,</v>

992
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 3>you can even live in Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sub,</v>

993
00:44:39.301 --> 00:44:41.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sub zero temperatures,</v>

994
00:44:41.521 --> 00:44:43.740
<v Speaker 3>like if it's zero outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can walk around,</v>

995
00:44:43.741 --> 00:44:46.620
<v Speaker 3>you can go places like if it's 130</v>
<v Speaker 3>degrees outside,</v>

996
00:44:46.621 --> 00:44:47.454
<v Speaker 3>you can't go anywhere.</v>

997
00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can only go places when it's</v>

998
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.390
<v Speaker 2>subfreezing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have been swimming,</v>

999
00:44:52.391 --> 00:44:57.370
<v Speaker 2>my sister in law is finish and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finland they go in the Saunas and then</v>

1000
00:44:57.371 --> 00:45:01.180
<v Speaker 2>they'd go out and swim in lakes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of nowhere when it is minus 22</v>

1001
00:45:01.181 --> 00:45:04.540
<v Speaker 2>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been swimming in a lake when it's</v>

1002
00:45:04.541 --> 00:45:07.420
<v Speaker 2>minus 22 degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing is frozen over God.</v>

1003
00:45:07.421 --> 00:45:08.620
<v Speaker 2>They just chip a hole in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1004
00:45:08.621 --> 00:45:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Then I didn't need to chip it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They uh,</v>

1005
00:45:10.061 --> 00:45:13.000
<v Speaker 2>they have a whole like add water spouts</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the water keeps moving.</v>

1006
00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:15.160
<v Speaker 2>So</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1007
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:16.470
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made,</v>

1008
00:45:16.471 --> 00:45:19.810
<v Speaker 2>maybe they stopped by chipping it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's basically like a bubbling cold</v>

1009
00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:21.670
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you sit in the sauna,</v>

1010
00:45:21.671 --> 00:45:23.170
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1011
00:45:23.171 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nudging 100 degrees Celsius.</v>

1012
00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>200,</v>

1013
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:31.060
<v Speaker 2>200 degrees Fahrenheit or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you come out through the air,</v>

1014
00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:35.230
<v Speaker 2>which is minus 20 Fahrenheit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it crosses Fahrenheit and</v>

1015
00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Celsius crossover around it in the low</v>
<v Speaker 2>minus twenties.</v>

1016
00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.970
<v Speaker 2>And then you get in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't put your head under</v>

1017
00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:41.710
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can go into this condition where</v>

1018
00:45:41.711 --> 00:45:43.780
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain essentially shuts down and</v>

1019
00:45:43.781 --> 00:45:46.400
<v Speaker 2>goes into phrase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1020
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:47.323
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1021
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:51.760
<v Speaker 2>the people in Finland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they love it so that it looks like they</v>

1022
00:45:51.761 --> 00:45:52.730
<v Speaker 2>cut a hole in the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1023
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:54.030
<v Speaker 2>That looks like they got a hole in</v>
<v Speaker 2>layoffs.</v>

1024
00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.200
<v Speaker 2>But that's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you got to my facebook and probably</v>

1025
00:45:56.201 --> 00:45:57.790
<v Speaker 2>find it back there somewhere in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep,</v>

1026
00:45:57.791 --> 00:45:59.140
<v Speaker 2>dark and distant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pam.</v>

1027
00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1028
00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well people loved that.</v>

1029
00:46:01.471 --> 00:46:05.010
<v Speaker 3>That ice cold ice cold going back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>forth between the two of them is</v>

1030
00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.280
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you a high.</v>

1031
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.310
<v Speaker 3>The does well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually really does actually</v>

1032
00:46:09.311 --> 00:46:11.320
<v Speaker 3>produces certain chemicals in your</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

1033
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Epinephrin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what is norepinephrine?</v>

1034
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.580
<v Speaker 3>Norepinephrine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll believe you.</v>

1035
00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm Dr Rhonda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Patrick was on.</v>

1036
00:46:18.191 --> 00:46:19.370
<v Speaker 3>She was talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1037
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:23.500
<v Speaker 3>cold shock therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cold shock proteins and heat shock</v>

1038
00:46:23.501 --> 00:46:26.120
<v Speaker 3>proteins and that there's a different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1039
00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.310
<v Speaker 3>there's different proteins that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>produce in the sauna and the sauna is</v>

1040
00:46:30.311 --> 00:46:32.410
<v Speaker 3>really beneficial for hormone</v>
<v Speaker 3>production,</v>

1041
00:46:32.411 --> 00:46:34.300
<v Speaker 3>for sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Melatonin production,</v>

1042
00:46:34.301 --> 00:46:37.000
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things Melatonin might not have been,</v>

1043
00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.420
<v Speaker 3>but all sorts of growth hormone for</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

1044
00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.400
<v Speaker 3>That was one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But things that rejuvenate the body</v>

1045
00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:44.220
<v Speaker 3>produced by these heat shock protein.</v>

1046
00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:45.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just look at the nordic,</v>

1047
00:46:45.341 --> 00:46:49.540
<v Speaker 2>paypal and paypal in northern Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will swear by soreness I mean the</v>

1048
00:46:49.541 --> 00:46:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Swedes and the Norwegians and the Finns</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Danes.</v>

1049
00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:54.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like these are not people who</v>

1050
00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:56.050
<v Speaker 2>you'd want to emulate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These</v>

1051
00:46:56.050 --> 00:46:57.550
<v Speaker 3>are very attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>

1052
00:46:57.551 --> 00:46:58.960
<v Speaker 3>long living people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1053
00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:03.010
<v Speaker 3>they're robust yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there's definitely something</v>

1054
00:47:03.011 --> 00:47:05.650
<v Speaker 3>to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to both sauna and cold baths.</v>

1055
00:47:05.651 --> 00:47:07.810
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when Hoff know Wim Hof,</v>

1056
00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:13.260
<v Speaker 3>Wim Hoff method of breathing and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>got something like 26 world records.</v>

1057
00:47:13.391 --> 00:47:16.060
<v Speaker 3>She's been on the podcast for 2:26 world</v>
<v Speaker 3>records,</v>

1058
00:47:16.061 --> 00:47:20.860
<v Speaker 3>but like dealing with climate and cold,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he summited everest in his shorts with</v>

1059
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.780
<v Speaker 3>ice sandals on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even kidding.</v>

1060
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:24.550
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no oxygen.</v>

1061
00:47:24.551 --> 00:47:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Didn't bring any oxygen with them is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>maniac.</v>

1062
00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:29.950
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's developed ability to</v>

1063
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:35.010
<v Speaker 1>tolerate extreme temperature distance or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a temperature changes and he swears by</v>

1064
00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thinks it's a great teacher about</v>

1065
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:42.430
<v Speaker 1>life and who you are and what you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just invigorates you in some strange</v>

1066
00:47:42.431 --> 00:47:43.500
<v Speaker 1>way that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1067
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:45.220
<v Speaker 1>when you meet the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you believe it because he's like</v>

1068
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.050
<v Speaker 1>radiating energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 2>It's funny what people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like Tim,</v>

1070
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Tim Ferris as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1071
00:47:50.051 --> 00:47:50.471
<v Speaker 2>Where he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1072
00:47:50.471 --> 00:47:53.590
<v Speaker 2>he'll go through periods where he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>taken my spots and doing all this crazy</v>

1073
00:47:53.591 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 2>shit and measuring the impact that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has on his physiology.</v>

1074
00:47:56.411 --> 00:47:58.150
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just too lazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1075
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1076
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:02.830
<v Speaker 2>I can't talk to you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1077
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1078
00:48:06.191 --> 00:48:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I understand man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you say the,</v>

1079
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just say the Philadelphia conference</v>

1080
00:48:09.791 --> 00:48:10.601
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I sent you,</v>

1081
00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:11.890
<v Speaker 2>which was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1082
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:14.710
<v Speaker 2>about what people's guilt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty.</v>

1083
00:48:14.711 --> 00:48:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did I do?</v>

1084
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.630
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was white.</v>

1085
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 2>There was a white privileged conference.</v>

1086
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.313
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1087
00:48:20.570 --> 00:48:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I love that article at that because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>did this.</v>

1088
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>

1090
00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is my twitter blowing up?</v>

1091
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:28.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe retweeted me.</v>

1092
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.610
<v Speaker 2>So there was this white privileged</v>
<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>

1093
00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.790
<v Speaker 2>which was a kind of politically correct</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk fast.</v>

1094
00:48:34.791 --> 00:48:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it basically ended up consuming</v>

1095
00:48:38.451 --> 00:48:41.480
<v Speaker 2>itself entirely because the people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>were attending it decided that the</v>

1096
00:48:41.481 --> 00:48:45.030
<v Speaker 2>conference itself had become too white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they were getting,</v>

1097
00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:47.240
<v Speaker 2>they were all there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had this Hashtag.</v>

1098
00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm white privileged conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so white WPC,</v>

1099
00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:52.920
<v Speaker 2>so white.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1100
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.960
<v Speaker 2>and it started after one of the speakers</v>
<v Speaker 2>there who was a white historian,</v>

1101
00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went overtime and won an Asian American,</v>

1102
00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:04.160
<v Speaker 2>attend a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a woman tweeted out great keynote,</v>

1103
00:49:04.190 --> 00:49:07.820
<v Speaker 2>but going over time allotted is another</v>
<v Speaker 2>example of white supremacy,</v>

1104
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag white privilege conference so</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>

1105
00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:14.550
<v Speaker 1>And he also made the mistake of using</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

1106
00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:17.400
<v Speaker 2>inward in his speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he obviously was using it in a</v>

1107
00:49:17.401 --> 00:49:19.980
<v Speaker 2>historical context because he was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about race in America.</v>

1108
00:49:19.981 --> 00:49:22.230
<v Speaker 2>But once that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1109
00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:25.350
<v Speaker 2>what could possibly go wrong using the</v>
<v Speaker 2>inward at a conference about white</v>

1110
00:49:25.351 --> 00:49:26.184
<v Speaker 2>guilt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1111
00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:27.360
<v Speaker 2>Then everyone starts tweeting</v>

1112
00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:32.950
<v Speaker 1>would never acceptable from Hashtag</v>
<v Speaker 1>white folks lips deeply offensive and</v>

1113
00:49:32.951 --> 00:49:35.560
<v Speaker 1>traumatizing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtag white privilege conference.</v>

1114
00:49:35.561 --> 00:49:37.750
<v Speaker 1>So white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was from a white Tweeta.</v>

1115
00:49:37.751 --> 00:49:40.360
<v Speaker 1>So then it's like a snake eating its</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking title.</v>

1116
00:49:40.361 --> 00:49:42.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these white people just accusing one</v>

1117
00:49:42.881 --> 00:49:45.180
<v Speaker 1>another of being too white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're all whites.</v>

1118
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.020
<v Speaker 1>We get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get it.</v>

1119
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It's would Michael Shermer calls virtue</v>
<v Speaker 1>signaling,</v>

1120
00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:51.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1121
00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:51.911
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's there.</v>

1122
00:49:51.911 --> 00:49:56.911
<v Speaker 1>They're letting the perfect term there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to find someone who's</v>

1123
00:49:57.341 --> 00:50:02.320
<v Speaker 1>made some sort of an error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're attacking them with full force.</v>

1124
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also like they're ignoring</v>

1125
00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:09.630
<v Speaker 1>context on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like by saying that the word is,</v>

1126
00:50:09.631 --> 00:50:14.140
<v Speaker 1>it's never acceptable to say the n word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By saying that and putting that in a</v>

1127
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:16.180
<v Speaker 1>tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

1128
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if there is a reason to say it,</v>

1129
00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:23.260
<v Speaker 1>if you were explaining something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

1130
00:50:23.261 --> 00:50:25.690
<v Speaker 1>what someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they said it,</v>

1131
00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.680
<v Speaker 1>you are allowed to repeat word.</v>

1132
00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:31.010
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you're not allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat the word around grown adults is</v>

1133
00:50:31.011 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 1>to pretend that word is magic to where</v>
<v Speaker 1>that going to conjure demon,</v>

1134
00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.680
<v Speaker 1>but it also empowers the word I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1135
00:50:36.681 --> 00:50:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I feel stupid for even having used the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase the anyway because ordinarily I'd</v>

1136
00:50:39.261 --> 00:50:39.761
<v Speaker 1>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nigga,</v>

1137
00:50:39.761 --> 00:50:42.920
<v Speaker 1>if I'm talking about the existence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would shock the podcast on</v>

1138
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Australian so I don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>context.</v>

1139
00:50:45.231 --> 00:50:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

1140
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:49.670
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this on my podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1141
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:53.240
<v Speaker 1>I do think that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten away from like where is the</v>

1142
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:55.250
<v Speaker 1>other person's heart and what is their</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention?</v>

1143
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.890
<v Speaker 1>So like if you ever use that word in</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

1144
00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:01.010
<v Speaker 1>add another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think your total count and you should</v>

1145
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:03.980
<v Speaker 1>not do that or you're running a nigger.</v>

1146
00:51:06.810 --> 00:51:08.510
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mean that gentleman,</v>

1147
00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't help it as a stand up</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedian in me,</v>

1148
00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:11.423
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1149
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 1>but if you're just using it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation in order to talk about the</v>

1150
00:51:14.181 --> 00:51:17.150
<v Speaker 1>existence of the wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that though everyone knows that.</v>

1151
00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:20.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a tough thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem with a lot of these,</v>

1152
00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:24.500
<v Speaker 1>these things where you attack someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>use of a word,</v>

1153
00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:28.010
<v Speaker 1>it's Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes one of those things like if</v>

1154
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:31.130
<v Speaker 1>someone says sexism is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism is system is bad,</v>

1155
00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:36.170
<v Speaker 1>we need to be a more integrated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete and whole culture and society</v>

1156
00:51:36.171 --> 00:51:38.660
<v Speaker 1>and we need to look at each other for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Martin Luther King said,</v>

1157
00:51:38.661 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 1>the content of their character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the color of their skin.</v>

1158
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that Dha at a certain point in</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

1159
00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:47.360
<v Speaker 1>some people think that it's not dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough in enough places with enough</v>

1160
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:49.850
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to educate racists or we</v>

1161
00:51:49.851 --> 00:51:52.610
<v Speaker 1>just gonna toot our own horn as to how</v>
<v Speaker 1>non racist we are.</v>

1162
00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:54.590
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The latter.</v>

1163
00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Because another one of the tweets that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened at this conference.</v>

1164
00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.350
<v Speaker 1>What red?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A white woman telling a black woman to</v>

1165
00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:04.490
<v Speaker 1>close the door at a workshop session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example of Hashtag white</v>

1166
00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:05.690
<v Speaker 1>privileged conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

1167
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.690
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to tell a person of</v>
<v Speaker 1>color to do anything.</v>

1168
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:10.340
<v Speaker 1>No charges eps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1169
00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Even gentle little flowers to just leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water running.</v>

1170
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Just whatever you're allowed to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1171
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.040
<v Speaker 1>can you shut that water off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1172
00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:19.190
<v Speaker 1>that's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1173
00:52:19.191 --> 00:52:20.500
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1174
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.290
<v Speaker 1>what if they just throw lit cigarettes</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the ground outside?</v>

1175
00:52:24.291 --> 00:52:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Are you allowed to correct them or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No?</v>

1176
00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:28.340
<v Speaker 1>That's racist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racist.</v>

1177
00:52:28.550 --> 00:52:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if,</v>

1178
00:52:29.631 --> 00:52:32.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just spend the whole rest of the</v>

1179
00:52:32.541 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Puc house going through hypothetical</v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdotes about what would be,</v>

1180
00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:40.980
<v Speaker 1>what would very strange that there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>word that certain people are allowed to</v>

1181
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:43.730
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the black people can use it and</v>

1182
00:52:43.731 --> 00:52:46.010
<v Speaker 1>they can even use it as a form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>empowerment,</v>

1183
00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1184
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.560
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's hypocritical?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reckon if you,</v>

1185
00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I reckon if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in your ancestors have been</v>

1186
00:52:52.281 --> 00:52:54.110
<v Speaker 1>fucked over completely full hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

1187
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.590
<v Speaker 1>then it's a little bit rich when the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the people who belong to the</v>

1188
00:52:57.591 --> 00:53:02.591
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity that's been fucking you over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let you reclaim the wood that was</v>

1189
00:53:02.691 --> 00:53:03.780
<v Speaker 1>previously oppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1190
00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:04.970
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

1191
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:09.530
<v Speaker 1>it in practice it seems correct when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being done.</v>

1192
00:53:09.610 --> 00:53:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if a white person uses the word and</v>

1193
00:53:12.351 --> 00:53:15.050
<v Speaker 1>they use it for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even me just using it in that joke,</v>

1194
00:53:15.051 --> 00:53:17.780
<v Speaker 1>just joking around and what have you</v>
<v Speaker 1>done?</v>

1195
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:18.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1196
00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a joke and it still impacts and</v>

1197
00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:25.500
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a very bizarre way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if a rapper is using it,</v>

1198
00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:27.230
<v Speaker 1>it seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1199
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.460
<v Speaker 1>like someone saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1200
00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:31.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying man,</v>

1201
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:32.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1202
00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.450
<v Speaker 1>it's become that.</v>

1203
00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:35.850
<v Speaker 1>But it was subversive when black people</v>
<v Speaker 1>started saying.</v>

1204
00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:36.753
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1205
00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:39.300
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my point being a white person saying</v>

1206
00:53:39.301 --> 00:53:43.200
<v Speaker 1>the exact same things as horrific and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocking that stitches guy,</v>

1207
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:46.380
<v Speaker 1>stitches guy likes that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He throws the word around all the time.</v>

1208
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't surprise me at all.</v>

1209
00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nuts on him.</v>

1210
00:53:49.530 --> 00:53:51.430
<v Speaker 1>That's not him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stitches to run with the joker.</v>

1211
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1212
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta get your white people straight</v>

1213
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 1>out of the birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Black Guy,</v>

1214
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:58.220
<v Speaker 1>that's Gucci Mane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He uses it to assist.</v>

1215
00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:00.660
<v Speaker 1>I just mistook a white person for black</v>
<v Speaker 1>fests are amazing.</v>

1216
00:54:00.661 --> 00:54:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't even see color president too</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

1217
00:54:03.091 --> 00:54:05.430
<v Speaker 1>You were born and some other shit hole</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you were born here.</v>

1218
00:54:05.431 --> 00:54:06.990
<v Speaker 1>You could have a fucking real good run</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

1219
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

1220
00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Can't do what trump does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at that admiringly.</v>

1221
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does he have the Bulls?</v>

1222
00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:18.720
<v Speaker 1>The audacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you wouldn't do it that way.</v>

1223
00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:20.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think is</v>

1224
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:24.600
<v Speaker 1>fascinating about trump and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic is that human beings love to</v>

1225
00:54:24.601 --> 00:54:28.830
<v Speaker 1>be united in tribes and not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>always good tribes.</v>

1226
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:33.030
<v Speaker 1>We love to be united in tribes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's tribes of people who use</v>

1227
00:54:33.031 --> 00:54:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Mac over windows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's tribes of android users or</v>

1228
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:41.850
<v Speaker 1>it's tribes of people from Wisconsin</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus tribes from people from Texas.</v>

1229
00:54:42.060 --> 00:54:45.210
<v Speaker 1>We love to be in a fucking collective</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people,</v>

1230
00:54:45.690 --> 00:54:48.900
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not a good group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if it's not good ideas,</v>

1231
00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:52.980
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbed about what this trump thing</v>

1232
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:57.150
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many annoying goofy white dudes are</v>

1233
00:54:57.151 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 1>really into him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like there's an anti</v>

1234
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:06.111
<v Speaker 1>intellectual aspect that got shut down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate aspect about this.</v>

1235
00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1236
00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of that being</v>
<v Speaker 1>sarcastic because it goes cultural</v>

1237
00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Australian to trump's support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all of us.</v>

1238
00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's intelligent people that support</v>

1239
00:55:14.701 --> 00:55:17.940
<v Speaker 1>them to totally but then not supporting</v>
<v Speaker 1>him because he,</v>

1240
00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:20.550
<v Speaker 1>his ideas are intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're supporting him in spite of the</v>

1241
00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:23.040
<v Speaker 1>fact that they're intelligent because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about his vibe that</v>

1242
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:25.620
<v Speaker 1>appeals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's a bunch of people</v>

1243
00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:29.940
<v Speaker 1>supporting him cause he's winning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to see him win and they want</v>

1244
00:55:29.941 --> 00:55:33.570
<v Speaker 1>to get in on some of that winning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of dumb white dudes that</v>

1245
00:55:33.571 --> 00:55:37.140
<v Speaker 1>are hopping aboard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are just letting you know who's</v>

1246
00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.340
<v Speaker 1>winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's winning,</v>

1247
00:55:38.730 --> 00:55:40.140
<v Speaker 1>winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's partly that.</v>

1248
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:42.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it's partly exhaustion with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>political correctness that we've just</v>

1249
00:55:42.991 --> 00:55:44.880
<v Speaker 1>been talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that they feel like they</v>

1250
00:55:44.881 --> 00:55:49.650
<v Speaker 1>can't say anything about the threat of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamist terrorism or about the changing</v>

1251
00:55:49.651 --> 00:55:53.160
<v Speaker 1>demographics of America or illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration without being branded as a</v>

1252
00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.000
<v Speaker 1>bigot.</v>

1253
00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.360
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's also just what I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying before about him seeming</v>

1254
00:55:57.361 --> 00:55:59.610
<v Speaker 1>refreshing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's the same back in Australia.</v>

1255
00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I was back in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1256
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:05.280
<v Speaker 1>about six weeks ago and I was on a panel</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and they were asking me about</v>

1257
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:07.200
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the audience asks questions and</v>

1258
00:56:07.201 --> 00:56:11.790
<v Speaker 1>stuff and I was trying to explain it by</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference to the fact that even in</v>

1259
00:56:11.791 --> 00:56:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't feel like politicians are</v>

1260
00:56:14.341 --> 00:56:18.440
<v Speaker 1>speaking their language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like actual human beings and are like,</v>

1261
00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:20.190
<v Speaker 1>take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gay marriage in Australia.</v>

1262
00:56:20.191 --> 00:56:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Australia still doesn't have gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

1263
00:56:23.470 --> 00:56:25.420
<v Speaker 1>You should be psyched about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to give away half your</v>

1264
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:28.330
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry honey.</v>

1265
00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.670
<v Speaker 1>Can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to marry you.</v>

1266
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.190
<v Speaker 1>Shit ain't happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be fucking pumped.</v>

1267
00:56:33.191 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Tax Laws are different though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually better to be married in</v>

1268
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Australia than it is not to be married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like here where they screw you.</v>

1269
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:39.940
<v Speaker 1>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not An understanding that someone's</v>

1270
00:56:39.941 --> 00:56:40.920
<v Speaker 1>going to take care of your shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1271
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:42.700
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get divorced,</v>

1272
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:44.290
<v Speaker 1>they're going to take off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want.</v>

1273
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:47.800
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck taxes.</v>

1274
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:49.383
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about that.</v>

1275
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:50.420
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1276
00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Australia is one of the most pro gay</v>

1277
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:56.320
<v Speaker 2>marriage places in the world when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually poll people 70 slash 80 percent</v>

1278
00:56:56.321 --> 00:56:58.330
<v Speaker 2>of the population wants gay marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1279
00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.670
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the least religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the world when you poll</v>

1280
00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:03.940
<v Speaker 2>people and more than 60 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>population don't believe in God or go to</v>

1281
00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:07.120
<v Speaker 2>church regularly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last prime minister,</v>

1282
00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.120
<v Speaker 2>the prime minister before last was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>unmarried atheist woman.</v>

1283
00:57:10.570 --> 00:57:13.510
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like this is a place where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would expect people to be opposed to</v>

1284
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:14.210
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage.</v>

1285
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I bet what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Bet I get it.</v>

1286
00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I bet gay dudes are secretly going and</v>
<v Speaker 1>voting against gay marriage so they</v>

1287
00:57:20.571 --> 00:57:21.800
<v Speaker 1>don't have to get married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1288
00:57:21.801 --> 00:57:24.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like these pot dealers up</v>

1289
00:57:24.801 --> 00:57:28.580
<v Speaker 1>in northern California that secretly</v>
<v Speaker 1>voted against marijuana legalization</v>

1290
00:57:28.581 --> 00:57:30.860
<v Speaker 1>because he wanted to keep it illegal so</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can make more money and they</v>

1291
00:57:30.861 --> 00:57:33.830
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have to turn in the taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's shrewd.</v>

1292
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It's dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dirty and it's prevalent.</v>

1293
00:57:36.441 --> 00:57:39.500
<v Speaker 1>I talked to some growers that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling me they were going to vote</v>

1294
00:57:39.501 --> 00:57:41.030
<v Speaker 1>against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to vote against</v>

1295
00:57:41.031 --> 00:57:44.000
<v Speaker 1>legalization because legalization would</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck them over economically,</v>

1296
00:57:44.001 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 1>and I know I'm being selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hey man,</v>

1297
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:47.240
<v Speaker 1>it's so we do it up here.</v>

1298
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:49.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think the Mexican drug cartels</v>

1299
00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:52.790
<v Speaker 2>one end to the war on drugs Helena</v>
<v Speaker 2>course them.</v>

1300
00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:53.673
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you?</v>

1301
00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Why would you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But my point is simply that the prime</v>

1302
00:57:56.961 --> 00:57:59.330
<v Speaker 2>minister of Australia currently favors</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage.</v>

1303
00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:02.360
<v Speaker 2>The palate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a majority in parliament for it</v>

1304
00:58:02.361 --> 00:58:06.320
<v Speaker 2>and instead because he had to do some</v>
<v Speaker 2>shady backroom deal to get into power</v>

1305
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:10.470
<v Speaker 2>with his fellow party hacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's gonna.</v>

1306
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:12.740
<v Speaker 2>They're not doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be like a plebiscite,</v>

1307
00:58:12.741 --> 00:58:16.040
<v Speaker 2>which is like a nonbinding referendum</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it or something and all my only</v>

1308
00:58:16.041 --> 00:58:20.590
<v Speaker 2>point was it's so obvious that</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians are so full of shit and that</v>

1309
00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.420
<v Speaker 2>they are beholden to people other than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people who elected them.</v>

1310
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.030
<v Speaker 2>That whether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're listening to Ted Cruz or</v>

1311
00:58:26.031 --> 00:58:28.670
<v Speaker 2>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people just have a sense that they're</v>

1312
00:58:28.671 --> 00:58:32.870
<v Speaker 2>being fed lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you hear Hillary talking about after</v>

1313
00:58:32.871 --> 00:58:34.730
<v Speaker 2>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge group playing the Women's card?</v>

1314
00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.350
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1315
00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.380
<v Speaker 4>fat playing the Woman's Card,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dubbo,</v>

1316
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:43.050
<v Speaker 4>lame and weak while pay and</v>

1317
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.460
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody speaks like that.</v>

1318
00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Why are you speaking like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why you sound like like that so I can</v>

1319
00:58:50.051 --> 00:58:51.420
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can imagine people going,</v>

1320
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:53.080
<v Speaker 2>we'll get lists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

1321
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:56.280
<v Speaker 1>so gross hearing that it's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1322
00:58:56.281 --> 00:58:59.550
<v Speaker 1>she was a person who said that marriage</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be between a man and a woman</v>

1323
00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:02.250
<v Speaker 1>until 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1324
00:59:02.251 --> 00:59:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand and 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was still saying that that is just</v>

1325
00:59:05.761 --> 00:59:06.780
<v Speaker 1>retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

1326
00:59:06.781 --> 00:59:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Convenient how her views on everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>just happened to evolve at exactly the</v>

1327
00:59:10.591 --> 00:59:14.040
<v Speaker 1>same point so that when they win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>51 percent of the American population</v>

1328
00:59:14.041 --> 00:59:15.990
<v Speaker 1>comes around to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has an awakening.</v>

1329
00:59:15.991 --> 00:59:19.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just so mysterious that I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't understand,</v>

1330
00:59:19.801 --> 00:59:24.801
<v Speaker 1>and this is a key clue me in this who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to keep gay marriage illegal in</v>

1331
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Australia because if there's all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1332
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.350
<v Speaker 1>you would think that if the majority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people wanted it,</v>

1333
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.440
<v Speaker 1>if the prime minister wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all these people wanted it,</v>

1334
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:34.490
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who is,</v>

1335
00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:37.610
<v Speaker 1>who's working in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what benefit is there of keeping it</v>

1336
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:38.080
<v Speaker 1>illegal?</v>

1337
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.440
<v Speaker 2>So think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everyone knows it's going to</v>

1338
00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:41.950
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of trying to postpone</v>

1339
00:59:41.951 --> 00:59:43.870
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's what's basically happened is</v>

1340
00:59:43.871 --> 00:59:47.470
<v Speaker 2>that there is a rift between within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conservative Party between conservative</v>

1341
00:59:47.471 --> 00:59:51.130
<v Speaker 2>conservatives and progressive and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>socially liberal conservatives.</v>

1342
00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I think about the Republican Party here</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you've got like Christian</v>

1343
00:59:53.711 --> 00:59:58.711
<v Speaker 2>evangelicals as a component of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've also got the rand poll slash</v>

1344
00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:01.390
<v Speaker 2>maybe Donald Trump kind of contingent</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who aren't,</v>

1345
01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.640
<v Speaker 2>who don't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't really care what people do in the</v>

1346
01:00:03.641 --> 01:00:06.610
<v Speaker 2>privacy of their own homes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're fiscally conservative.</v>

1347
01:00:07.030 --> 01:00:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people.</v>

1348
01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:13.560
<v Speaker 2>That faction had previously nominated a</v>
<v Speaker 2>leader to be the prime minister and that</v>

1349
01:00:14.051 --> 01:00:16.840
<v Speaker 2>was the prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got stabbed in the back by one of his</v>

1350
01:00:16.841 --> 01:00:20.470
<v Speaker 2>colleagues who's socially liberal and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only way that he could get the</v>

1351
01:00:20.471 --> 01:00:24.820
<v Speaker 2>support of the faction that he needed to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become prime minister was by</v>

1352
01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:27.250
<v Speaker 2>guaranteeing them that he wouldn't move</v>
<v Speaker 2>too fast on gay marriage.</v>

1353
01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:32.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's a minority of a minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of concern of like culturally</v>

1354
01:00:32.141 --> 01:00:35.890
<v Speaker 2>conservative conservatives who represent</v>
<v Speaker 2>rural districts with a bunch of farmers</v>

1355
01:00:35.891 --> 01:00:36.320
<v Speaker 2>in them.</v>

1356
01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farmers,</v>

1357
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always the God damn farmers.</v>

1358
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>I had a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my old specials,</v>

1359
01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>there's only two types of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about gay marriage.</v>

1360
01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>People were really dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or people that are secretly worried that</v>

1361
01:00:48.591 --> 01:00:53.591
<v Speaker 1>dicks are delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think that makes sense.</v>

1362
01:00:57.201 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking farmers.</v>

1363
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got to get them to suck a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick.</v>

1364
01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>And he exactly could realize what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Hoopla about what about</v>

1365
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>just go ahead and suck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't even like it.</v>

1366
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>And then you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1367
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1368
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>What about the guy who was sucking all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those whole sticks and um,</v>

1369
01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>and a claw is that Seattle was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was dressed up</v>

1370
01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.700
<v Speaker 2>and like leather and he'd go out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm in the middle of the night and he'd</v>

1371
01:01:21.701 --> 01:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>like give.</v>

1372
01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the guy who got</v>

1373
01:01:25.131 --> 01:01:27.530
<v Speaker 1>arrested several times talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who died.</v>

1374
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>He died from getting fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his name was.</v>

1375
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>They used to call him Mr Hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that you know his name.</v>

1376
01:01:34.551 --> 01:01:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a documentary called zoo and</v>

1377
01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>it was all about zoophilia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a real sexual attraction that</v>

1378
01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>people have to farm animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Always white people by the way.</v>

1379
01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Hollow white people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1380
01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy who got arrested was</v>

1381
01:01:49.641 --> 01:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just covered in leather,</v>

1382
01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>black leather bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's from Australia.</v>

1383
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>It's also kind of adding insult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>injury for the animal that you're</v>

1384
01:02:01.371 --> 01:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>actually wearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leather.</v>

1385
01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing your hat.</v>

1386
01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing your skin at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I.</v>

1387
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:07.000
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not wearing a horse here.</v>

1388
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.941
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1389
01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>it's different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's different species,</v>

1390
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm this guy who lived in Itam claw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had found each other online on a</v>

1391
01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.870
<v Speaker 1>him in divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and all these people,</v>

1392
01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:20.040
<v Speaker 1>they develop this relationship</v>

1393
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:25.050
<v Speaker 3>online with these people that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>really into horses and getting fucked by</v>

1394
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:30.140
<v Speaker 3>farm animals and so they invested in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this property and they got this farm and</v>

1395
01:02:30.901 --> 01:02:33.150
<v Speaker 3>they had these horses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was over a hundred hours of</v>

1396
01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:37.260
<v Speaker 3>footage of these people getting fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>by animals and one guy,</v>

1397
01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 3>they type it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1398
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:40.020
<v Speaker 3>there's a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can watch it.</v>

1399
01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:40.530
<v Speaker 3>You want to see.</v>

1400
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:44.900
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What else am I doing this afternoon and</v>

1401
01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:51.170
<v Speaker 2>folks who are listening only I urge you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go to youtube just to watch the</v>

1402
01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:55.230
<v Speaker 2>subtle twist of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1403
01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to wake in Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a lot of time on my hands between</v>

1404
01:02:58.321 --> 01:02:59.154
<v Speaker 2>meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There'll be.</v>

1405
01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to win the lottery?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1406
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.670
<v Speaker 3>Abandoned and famous enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Claw horse sex faces,</v>

1407
01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:08.010
<v Speaker 3>new charges in Tennessee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1408
01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.500
<v Speaker 3>was a different guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What year is this?</v>

1409
01:03:10.501 --> 01:03:12.100
<v Speaker 3>Two thousand nine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's after I'm.</v>

1410
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.830
<v Speaker 3>That guy was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It says.</v>

1411
01:03:13.831 --> 01:03:14.490
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here it is.</v>

1412
01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:18.300
<v Speaker 3>A former Washington state man who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>convicted of trespassing at an Itam</v>

1413
01:03:18.301 --> 01:03:22.590
<v Speaker 3>cloth farm where a man was fatally</v>
<v Speaker 3>injured while having sex with a horse in</v>

1414
01:03:22.591 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 3>2005.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1415
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.270
<v Speaker 3>Is accused of having sex with animals on</v>
<v Speaker 3>a Tennessee farm.</v>

1416
01:03:27.271 --> 01:03:29.190
<v Speaker 3>So one of the same people that was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that group,</v>

1417
01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:31.940
<v Speaker 2>the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they grow out of it?</v>

1418
01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1419
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:34.310
<v Speaker 2>the way you're hardwired is the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hardwired.</v>

1420
01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:35.870
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about all that.</v>

1421
01:03:35.871 --> 01:03:38.240
<v Speaker 2>I would think the ones that my friend</v>
<v Speaker 2>got fucked to death.</v>

1422
01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:39.980
<v Speaker 2>I might want to reconsider it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1423
01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:41.440
<v Speaker 2>you would think that sensible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

1424
01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing is like being gay or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1425
01:03:43.011 --> 01:03:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I always get in trouble because when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>talk about pedophilia and stuff like</v>

1426
01:03:45.771 --> 01:03:47.240
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sort of make the same analogy,</v>

1427
01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:51.230
<v Speaker 2>which is I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean whilst it's the worst conceivable</v>

1428
01:03:51.231 --> 01:03:53.360
<v Speaker 2>thing that I can imagine anyone doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>morally,</v>

1429
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:57.140
<v Speaker 2>I have some sympathy for people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard wired in such a way that they get a</v>

1430
01:03:57.141 --> 01:03:59.630
<v Speaker 2>hard on from infants or animals or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1431
01:03:59.631 --> 01:04:00.350
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1432
01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:03.230
<v Speaker 2>the reason I'm not a pedophile is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm morally superior is because</v>

1433
01:04:03.231 --> 01:04:06.470
<v Speaker 2>I've never been attracted to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to anyone who's not post pubescent,</v>

1434
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.680
<v Speaker 2>most likely you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely you're right.</v>

1435
01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:15.520
<v Speaker 3>The real problem becomes in trying to</v>
<v Speaker 3>decipher what is causing some person to</v>

1436
01:04:17.121 --> 01:04:20.840
<v Speaker 3>have these feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like is it an instance of them being</v>

1437
01:04:20.841 --> 01:04:22.440
<v Speaker 3>molested themselves and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>younger.</v>

1438
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:22.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1439
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Which is Mary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's disproportionately.</v>

1440
01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it just an error in the way the brain</v>

1441
01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:30.690
<v Speaker 2>works was that</v>

1442
01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.290
<v Speaker 3>some people have epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1443
01:04:32.291 --> 01:04:34.750
<v Speaker 3>but this is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is like clear victimization.</v>

1444
01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.650
<v Speaker 3>Gayness is to people choosing to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>attracted to the same sex or being</v>

1445
01:04:38.651 --> 01:04:40.720
<v Speaker 3>attracted the same sex and choosing to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be with each other rather.</v>

1446
01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is different.</v>

1447
01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1448
01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're attracted to.</v>

1449
01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you separate the actual act,</v>

1450
01:04:47.490 --> 01:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously it's very,</v>

1451
01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:51.620
<v Speaker 2>very different because you're abusing</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who ha,</v>

1452
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:53.490
<v Speaker 2>who doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who isn't old enough to be able to</v>

1453
01:04:53.491 --> 01:04:54.790
<v Speaker 2>consent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1454
01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:59.810
<v Speaker 2>but the act of feeling like you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>attracted a radically to a baby,</v>

1455
01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:03.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regardless of whether you act on it,</v>

1456
01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.380
<v Speaker 2>that is something that's subjectively</v>
<v Speaker 2>must just be a horrible prison.</v>

1457
01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you could never get your</v>

1458
01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:13.701
<v Speaker 2>rocks off without torturing and other</v>
<v Speaker 2>person wouldn't be a pretty place to be.</v>

1459
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.620
<v Speaker 2>It would be horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just wonder,</v>

1460
01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:17.721
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1461
01:05:17.721 --> 01:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I would</v>

1462
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>like to agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I think about it,</v>

1463
01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what is the actual process that</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads someone who's.</v>

1464
01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on in their mind?</v>

1465
01:05:28.421 --> 01:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't grasp it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't understand it,</v>

1466
01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.180
<v Speaker 1>so may I just got to be multifactorial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1467
01:05:33.290 --> 01:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>It's got a bunch of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably childhood abuse.</v>

1468
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a combination of who</v>
<v Speaker 1>knows,</v>

1469
01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:40.480
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't change the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're presumably not capable of,</v>

1470
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of changing it.</v>

1471
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be true.</v>

1472
01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>The recidivism rate amongst people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>molest children is insanely high.</v>

1473
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give them the option of chemical</v>

1474
01:05:50.621 --> 01:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>castration as much additive to jail and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then just have them with low libido</v>

1475
01:05:54.821 --> 01:05:58.210
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem becomes whether or not it's</v>

1476
01:05:58.211 --> 01:06:03.040
<v Speaker 1>actually sexual or whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological and if it's uniform,</v>

1477
01:06:03.250 --> 01:06:06.850
<v Speaker 1>like some people might be sexually</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to children in some way that</v>

1478
01:06:06.851 --> 01:06:10.090
<v Speaker 1>you could cure with chemical castration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas some of them might be</v>

1479
01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:14.710
<v Speaker 1>psychologically attracted to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance and to like what they say</v>

1480
01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:15.490
<v Speaker 1>about rape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1481
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:18.220
<v Speaker 1>That rape isn't really about sex and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the cases,</v>

1482
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.300
<v Speaker 1>obviously in some cases it's about sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in some cases it's not.</v>

1483
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:25.060
<v Speaker 1>It's about power and dominance and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people.</v>

1484
01:06:25.061 --> 01:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>It's not a sexual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if they wound up because they</v>

1485
01:06:27.671 --> 01:06:32.110
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wound up just doing things to kids</v>

1486
01:06:32.290 --> 01:06:35.200
<v Speaker 1>in a fucked up way because they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to control them and dominate them.</v>

1487
01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Well then they're just being dicks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean it might be the origin of it</v>

1488
01:06:39.521 --> 01:06:40.354
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there,</v>

1489
01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:44.050
<v Speaker 1>there might be a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>versions of this and that's for them.</v>

1490
01:06:44.051 --> 01:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>That might be the origin of it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be just they want to torture</v>

1491
01:06:46.661 --> 01:06:47.494
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

1492
01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's associate pass out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychopaths.</v>

1493
01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.870
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are just fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their brain is fucked.</v>

1494
01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:55.150
<v Speaker 1>When you hear about a serial killer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1495
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:58.330
<v Speaker 1>is there a chemical castration for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>serial killer to stop them from enjoying</v>

1496
01:06:58.331 --> 01:06:59.010
<v Speaker 1>killing people?</v>

1497
01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:01.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've spoken to experts about</v>

1498
01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:04.060
<v Speaker 1>pedophilia who say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do,</v>

1499
01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:08.800
<v Speaker 1>we're making a mistake at the moment by</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonizing the condition rather than</v>

1500
01:07:08.801 --> 01:07:10.460
<v Speaker 1>demonizing the act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1501
01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:14.140
<v Speaker 1>so what do you want to do is set up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario in which it's possible for a 15</v>

1502
01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:19.090
<v Speaker 1>year old kid who realizes that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracted to infants to go to a</v>

1503
01:07:19.091 --> 01:07:24.091
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist and get help and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>his options without feeling like he is a</v>

1504
01:07:25.121 --> 01:07:27.370
<v Speaker 1>total monster just because he's having</v>
<v Speaker 1>those feelings.</v>

1505
01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:30.490
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for us to think that way</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if he acted on those feelings,</v>

1506
01:07:30.491 --> 01:07:33.370
<v Speaker 1>he would be a monster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you want to find.</v>

1507
01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.060
<v Speaker 1>You want him to be able to avail himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>of whatever kind of medical treatment is</v>

1508
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:41.850
<v Speaker 1>available rather than just going out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hiding in the shadows and doing and</v>

1509
01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:44.740
<v Speaker 1>committing monstrous acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to get around that.</v>

1510
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody does.</v>

1511
01:07:46.241 --> 01:07:46.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

1512
01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:48.880
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why this is such</v>

1513
01:07:48.881 --> 01:07:52.390
<v Speaker 1>a compelling subject is because it's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most horrific things,</v>

1514
01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:57.690
<v Speaker 1>like there's some horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like undeniably horrific things that</v>

1515
01:07:58.511 --> 01:08:00.110
<v Speaker 1>people are capable of doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Murders,</v>

1516
01:08:00.111 --> 01:08:01.360
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red is one of them.</v>

1517
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Torture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>torture.</v>

1518
01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.940
<v Speaker 1>This is right up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right up there with torture with</v>

1519
01:08:04.941 --> 01:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Isis beheadings and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy on a talk show once that</v>

1520
01:08:08.171 --> 01:08:12.520
<v Speaker 1>was talking about his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's compelled to have sex with children</v>

1521
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:14.620
<v Speaker 1>and he's been sexually attracted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>children all of his life,</v>

1522
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.130
<v Speaker 1>but he fights it off and he doesn't</v>

1523
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.230
<v Speaker 3>do anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted people to understand it and he</v>

1524
01:08:18.231 --> 01:08:19.970
<v Speaker 3>was talking about it openly and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1525
01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.910
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how brave is this guy that he's willing</v>

1526
01:08:22.911 --> 01:08:26.720
<v Speaker 3>to go on television and do these</v>
<v Speaker 3>interviews and talk about his compulsion</v>

1527
01:08:26.721 --> 01:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>even though he says he's innocent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual act itself.</v>

1528
01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:35.350
<v Speaker 3>He has this compulsion and I think the</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectrum of a different ways that the</v>

1529
01:08:36.831 --> 01:08:41.831
<v Speaker 3>mind functions is so complex and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>confusing as to what's the origin of</v>

1530
01:08:42.021 --> 01:08:46.070
<v Speaker 3>these behavior patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it because of abuse is because of a</v>

1531
01:08:46.071 --> 01:08:47.420
<v Speaker 3>malfunction?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it a,</v>

1532
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:51.710
<v Speaker 3>is there a tumor like what the fuck is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on in someone's brain that leads</v>

1533
01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:55.040
<v Speaker 3>them down these paths and I don't think</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been answered.</v>

1534
01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:56.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1535
01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:58.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the take it back to be best</v>

1536
01:08:58.431 --> 01:09:00.920
<v Speaker 1>reality and like having a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving a horse a blow job.</v>

1537
01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 1>Like is there anything necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>unethical about giving a host of blow</v>

1538
01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.820
<v Speaker 1>job?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the horses pushing back?</v>

1539
01:09:07.821 --> 01:09:09.500
<v Speaker 1>I say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if?</v>

1540
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1541
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:13.860
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you offer up your butt to a horse and</v>

1542
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 1>he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's just digging in there.</v>

1543
01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:21.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what is morally,</v>

1544
01:09:21.561 --> 01:09:23.720
<v Speaker 1>what is actually morally wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking a horse?</v>

1545
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:26.120
<v Speaker 1>If the horse is into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the horse fucks you.</v>

1546
01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:31.121
<v Speaker 1>First of all the horses atop</v>
<v Speaker 1>the video of the guy getting fucked to</v>

1547
01:09:32.691 --> 01:09:36.730
<v Speaker 1>death by the horse though is horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course available.</v>

1548
01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:40.130
<v Speaker 1>How is he not able to get out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation with the horse out and pin?</v>

1549
01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.770
<v Speaker 1>Those are the video starts out with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>buddy of mine sent this to me.</v>

1550
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:47.630
<v Speaker 1>I watched it 100 times to my computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

1551
01:09:47.830 --> 01:09:49.580
<v Speaker 1>the screensaver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in there.</v>

1552
01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:52.790
<v Speaker 1>I just copy and I put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little flash drives leaving around my</v>

1553
01:09:52.791 --> 01:09:55.580
<v Speaker 1>house just in case somebody decided to</v>
<v Speaker 1>delete it off the Internet.</v>

1554
01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:59.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the video starts out and the guy is</v>

1555
01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:03.020
<v Speaker 1>naked and he's bent over bale of Hay and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then his friend,</v>

1556
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I use air quotes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabs a horse his penis and leaves it up</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's up in his laptop.</v>

1566

1567
01:10:29.421 --> 01:10:31.390
<v Speaker 1>available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1568
01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:33.753
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot.</v>

1569
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to put it in before the horse</v>

1570
01:10:35.961 --> 01:10:36.621
<v Speaker 1>can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1571
01:10:36.621 --> 01:10:38.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that simple.</v>

1572
01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1573
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>it's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things like,</v>

1574
01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:47.171
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is it about a person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that allows that in there?</v>

1576
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I think this would be an amazing thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to actually being there in the</v>

1577
01:10:55.011 --> 01:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>bond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like straddled over the bale of Hay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'd be too.</v>

1579
01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:01.370

<v Speaker 1>Even if I wanted to do it,</v>

1580
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:02.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll be too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's adorable.</v>

1581
01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.590
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have the guts</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1582
01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:10.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just thinking what the fuck do I</v>

1583

<v Speaker 1>know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

<v Speaker 1>walker.</v>

1585
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just.</v>

1586
01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a reason why some people love</v>

1587
01:11:17.431 --> 01:11:22.431
<v Speaker 1>jazz music and there's some people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>love basketball and some people like</v>

1588
01:11:22.651 --> 01:11:25.500
<v Speaker 1>sailing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people hate the water and some</v>

1589
01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>people want to sunbathe all day and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to only go out at night and</v>

1590
01:11:28.711 --> 01:11:33.711
<v Speaker 1>we're plucking people vary a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in this gigantic broad variance of</v>

1591
01:11:34.861 --> 01:11:39.861
<v Speaker 1>human beings every now and then put one</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure cooker spits out a doodle x get</v>

1592
01:11:40.321 --> 01:11:41.154
<v Speaker 1>fucked by a horse.</v>

1593
01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I totally take that,</v>

1594
01:11:42.651 --> 01:11:46.050
<v Speaker 2>but what I mean is I'm amazed at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the people who can,</v>

1595
01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.660
<v Speaker 2>who can translate their latent mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>desires into actual real world</v>

1596
01:11:50.661 --> 01:11:52.670
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether that's climbing Mount Everest.</v>

1597
01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:54.260
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's all kinds of things I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to do.</v>

1653
01:14:14.171 --> 01:14:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm feeling I'm feeling a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>violated.</v>

1654
01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should a guy died that way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Eighty minutes ago.</v>

1656
01:14:22.631 --> 01:14:27.631
<v Speaker 1>I pulled into the car park here on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful California day and if you'd</v>

1657
01:14:27.641 --> 01:14:32.641
<v Speaker 1>told me then that in 80 minutes time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have just watched a man die from</v>

1658
01:14:33.221 --> 01:14:35.350
<v Speaker 1>being anal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He raped by a horse.</v>

1659
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:37.930
<v Speaker 1>How about the sound he makes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have believed you when you</v>

1660
01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:38.790
<v Speaker 1>hear the sound again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1661
01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to hear the sound again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We should be happy.</v>

1664
01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Be Happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We figured out a way to not have this</v>

1665
01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:48.570
<v Speaker 1>happen to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1666
01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy to not have that happen</v>

1667
01:14:50.321 --> 01:14:50.721
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are.</v>

1668
01:14:50.721 --> 01:14:53.440
<v Speaker 1>There are so many things that have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in order for that to happen.</v>

1669
01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:54.883
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1670

<v Speaker 1>That's the moment in which is which</v>

1671
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:08.280
<v Speaker 1>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penis goes through his intestine and</v>

1672
01:15:08.281 --> 01:15:09.840
<v Speaker 1>into his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called.</v>

1673
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:13.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap for this life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>See the next dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gilis fucking way to die.</v>

1676
01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.870
<v Speaker 1>The Darwin awards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one who maybe lost.</v>

1677
01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:23.940
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's better than being in a</v>

1678
01:15:23.941 --> 01:15:25.590
<v Speaker 1>nursing home and having some guy kick</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1679
01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Isn't there anything in between that</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows my only two options?</v>

1680
01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Either they get to be in a nursing home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said,</v>

1681
01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:34.110
<v Speaker 1>somebody kicked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to get mainly raped to death by a</v>

1682
01:15:34.111 --> 01:15:35.010
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>

1683
01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.880
<v Speaker 1>we're options,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1684
01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.900
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my point of view is that this guy in</v>

1685
01:15:39.901 --> 01:15:44.100
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked to death by a horse</v>
<v Speaker 1>created this video and this video has</v>

1686
01:15:44.101 --> 01:15:48.240
<v Speaker 1>provided me with hundreds of hours of</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment that I would have never</v>

1687
01:15:48.241 --> 01:15:50.700
<v Speaker 1>gotten without this guide of videos.</v>

1688
01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Only one minute long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have 100 times.</v>

1689
01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I've watched it so many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm exaggerating,</v>

1690
01:15:56.630 --> 01:16:01.020
<v Speaker 1>but think about all the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the world who will now Google</v>

1691
01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Mr Han's find that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure it's up there somewhere.</v>

1692
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:06.420
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] laugh their fucking ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy probably gave all those</v>

1693
01:16:06.421 --> 01:16:09.390
<v Speaker 1>people a burst of happiness like through</v>
<v Speaker 1>his death.</v>

1694
01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Like do you think about like what you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done in life and what having those</v>

1695
01:16:13.801 --> 01:16:16.410
<v Speaker 1>experiences and showing them to other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1696
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:19.110
<v Speaker 1>what impact it has on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many people have watched people like</v>

1697
01:16:19.111 --> 01:16:21.300
<v Speaker 1>do those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those bird suits,</v>

1698
01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.330

<v Speaker 1>buildings and shit and they fly around</v>

01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:53.060
<v Speaker 1>See that's what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a humble bored on the road,</v>

1713
01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:58.110
<v Speaker 1>on the edge of the top of a skyscraper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are spinning around one of</v>

1714
01:16:58.351 --> 01:16:58.951
<v Speaker 1>these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1715
01:16:58.951 --> 01:17:01.890
<v Speaker 1>you're counting on these Chinese lithium</v>
<v Speaker 1>ion batteries.</v>

1716
01:17:01.891 --> 01:17:04.770
<v Speaker 1>They were put together by slaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if they're going to burst into</v>

1717
01:17:04.771 --> 01:17:06.450
<v Speaker 1>flames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's doing handstands.</v>

1718
01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:09.290
<v Speaker 1>He's doing fucking handstands on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a skyscraper.</v>

1719
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>What</v>

1720
01:17:10.100 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 3>does that Dubai's?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1721
01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Where is he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks like I can't watch this.</v>

1722
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:15.710
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's perfect example.</v>

1723
01:17:15.770 --> 01:17:18.560
<v Speaker 3>If you saw that like that gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thrill,</v>

1724
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.820
<v Speaker 3>but if one of those guys did that and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then when flying off the building like</v>

1725
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:23.690
<v Speaker 3>what did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't like what if Mr. Hands.</v>

1726
01:17:23.691 --> 01:17:26.210
<v Speaker 3>That was a video where he lived because</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got fucked to death.</v>

1727
01:17:26.211 --> 01:17:26.841
<v Speaker 3>A gang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1728
01:17:26.841 --> 01:17:28.790
<v Speaker 3>you got fucked a gang at times where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get fucked to death.</v>

1729
01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:30.250
<v Speaker 2>I'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd be happier.</v>

1730
01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:33.180
<v Speaker 2>I'd be happier if he lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I wouldn't know.</v>

1731
01:17:33.230 --> 01:17:38.230
<v Speaker 2>I also wouldn't be happy about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just enjoying the entire Mr Han's</v>

1732
01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:39.670
<v Speaker 2>experienced Joe Rogan.</v>

1733
01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:41.450
<v Speaker 3>What if you met him and then he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>annoying you?</v>

1734
01:17:41.490 --> 01:17:43.550
<v Speaker 3>I wish that guy got fucked to death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably would be.</v>

1735
01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:45.313
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear,</v>

1736
01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.300
<v Speaker 2>did you hear that Oklahoma has had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>change there.</v>

1737
01:17:48.301 --> 01:17:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I was just looking this up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when we were talking about</v>

1738
01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:55.520
<v Speaker 2>pedophilia that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a rape case in.</v>

1739
01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:58.020
<v Speaker 2>This is not something to laugh about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is interesting about how we</v>

1740
01:17:58.021 --> 01:18:01.890
<v Speaker 2>define rape were a 17 year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was last month.</v>

1741
01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.410
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a 16 year old.</v>

1742
01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.560
<v Speaker 2>He made her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1743
01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:09.750
<v Speaker 2>here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was really drunk.</v>

1744
01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:11.550
<v Speaker 2>They'd been drinking in the park with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some friends.</v>

1745
01:18:11.670 --> 01:18:14.250
<v Speaker 2>He gave her a ride home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She woke up,</v>

1746
01:18:14.610 --> 01:18:17.340
<v Speaker 2>I think in the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely deliriously drunk,</v>

1747
01:18:17.341 --> 01:18:19.530
<v Speaker 2>and her mother or grandmother took her</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the hospital because she was so</v>

1748
01:18:19.531 --> 01:18:22.550
<v Speaker 2>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She woke up in hospital.</v>

1749
01:18:22.570 --> 01:18:26.610
<v Speaker 2>First thing she kind of really</v>
<v Speaker 2>remembered was the doctor's asking her</v>

1750
01:18:26.611 --> 01:18:31.410
<v Speaker 2>what kind of sexual activity she had</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened because they'd found a some of</v>

1751
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:35.130
<v Speaker 2>the 17 year old's DNA around her mouth</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on her legs.</v>

1752
01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:38.430
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got no recollection.</v>

1753
01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:40.890
<v Speaker 2>They went to the guy and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1754
01:18:40.891 --> 01:18:44.250
<v Speaker 2>you want it to give me a blow job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she gave me a blow job when she was</v>

1755
01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.270
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blackout drunk.</v>

1756
01:18:45.540 --> 01:18:48.960
<v Speaker 2>So she charges him for rape and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oklahoma court found that it wasn't</v>

1757
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:52.140
<v Speaker 2>forcible rape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now they're having to change</v>

1758
01:18:52.141 --> 01:18:55.260
<v Speaker 2>Oklahoma's laws because the only thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would have been that would have</v>

1759
01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it basically has to be forcible.</v>

1760
01:18:57.181 --> 01:18:58.800
<v Speaker 2>It's called forceable sodomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1761
01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:02.580
<v Speaker 2>And if the judge was saying if a victim</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so intoxicated that they are</v>

1762
01:19:02.581 --> 01:19:05.760
<v Speaker 2>completely unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not actually forcible because</v>

1763
01:19:05.761 --> 01:19:08.190
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't forced to do it.</v>

1764
01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:11.540
<v Speaker 2>They didn't even know that they were or</v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't doing it.</v>

1765
01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:13.621
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1766
01:19:13.621 --> 01:19:14.920
<v Speaker 2>how do you define that then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1767
01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.840
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1768
01:19:15.930 --> 01:19:18.780
<v Speaker 2>but I mean clearly you should not be</v>
<v Speaker 2>going around putting your Dick in</v>

1769
01:19:18.781 --> 01:19:21.300
<v Speaker 2>unconscious sixteen-year-olds mouths</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly,</v>

1770
01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time I can sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that maybe it's not the same</v>

1771
01:19:27.091 --> 01:19:32.091
<v Speaker 2>level of horribleness as like just flat</v>
<v Speaker 2>out raping somebody.</v>

1772
01:19:33.421 --> 01:19:33.730
<v Speaker 2>There's</v>

1773
01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:37.690
<v Speaker 3>also the problem with the girl possibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>consenting at the time just being so</v>

1774
01:19:37.691 --> 01:19:39.580
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't remember consenting.</v>

1775
01:19:39.581 --> 01:19:42.160
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially she's 16 and it's one of her</v>

1776
01:19:42.161 --> 01:19:46.630
<v Speaker 3>first ever sexual experiences or first</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever drunk sexual experiences we should</v>

1777
01:19:46.631 --> 01:19:47.620
<v Speaker 3>assume.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1778
01:19:47.621 --> 01:19:51.960
<v Speaker 3>So it is entirely possible that this boy</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was only a few months older than her</v>

1779
01:19:51.990 --> 01:19:54.940
<v Speaker 3>didn't have the wherewithal to</v>
<v Speaker 3>understand that she was compromised to</v>

1780
01:19:54.941 --> 01:19:57.220
<v Speaker 3>the point where she couldn't consent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So who,</v>

1781
01:19:57.250 --> 01:20:01.840
<v Speaker 3>who are both drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets real weird.</v>

1782
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.590
<v Speaker 3>It gets real weird and we don't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what words were exchanged.</v>

1783
01:20:05.591 --> 01:20:08.610
<v Speaker 3>What actually did happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the history of these two together</v>

1784
01:20:08.611 --> 01:20:09.840
<v Speaker 3>was like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know.</v>

1785
01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I had to,</v>

1786
01:20:11.471 --> 01:20:13.120
<v Speaker 2>if I had a son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to say now,</v>

1787
01:20:13.121 --> 01:20:15.930
<v Speaker 2>just never ever have any sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>relations with anybody who's</v>

1788
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:19.740
<v Speaker 3>drunk because that's frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like getting fucked when they're</v>

1789
01:20:19.741 --> 01:20:21.600
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys like fucking their girlfriends when</v>

1790
01:20:21.601 --> 01:20:22.540
<v Speaker 3>they're drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean?</v>

1791
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:26.010
<v Speaker 3>Some everybody who like who didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's early sexual experiences with,</v>

1792
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:27.660
<v Speaker 3>with done sober what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what have you.</v>

1793
01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:31.170
<v Speaker 3>You're both drunk like that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a big thing that feminists</v>

1794
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:33.990
<v Speaker 3>were trying to push for a while and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of abandoned it because they</v>

1795
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:38.040
<v Speaker 3>realized that it literally makes 90</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the population a rapist and</v>

1796
01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:40.230
<v Speaker 3>they were saying you shouldn't have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even with your husband.</v>

1797
01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.450
<v Speaker 3>If your husband is drunk and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>sober,</v>

1798
01:20:42.451 --> 01:20:43.570
<v Speaker 3>don't have sex with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1799
01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:47.980
<v Speaker 3>Logistically saying that old drunk sex</v>
<v Speaker 3>is non consensual sex with because it's</v>

1800
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.750
<v Speaker 3>full.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Makes it ripe.</v>

1801
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:51.240
<v Speaker 3>You can't consent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the argument becomes,</v>

1802
01:20:51.241 --> 01:20:53.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come you're responsible for driving</v>

1803
01:20:53.881 --> 01:20:56.400
<v Speaker 3>your car when you're drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're responsible for that.</v>

1804
01:20:56.401 --> 01:20:58.350
<v Speaker 3>If you get caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're know you're not supposed to drive</v>

1805
01:20:58.351 --> 01:20:59.160
<v Speaker 3>your car when you're drunk.</v>

1806
01:20:59.160 --> 01:20:59.851
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1807
01:20:59.851 --> 01:21:02.160
<v Speaker 3>I was too drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't consent to drive my car.</v>

1808
01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:03.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're responsible.</v>

1809
01:21:03.211 --> 01:21:05.520
<v Speaker 3>You're a fucking adult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You responsible for violence.</v>

1810
01:21:05.521 --> 01:21:06.870
<v Speaker 3>You can't beat somebody up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1811
01:21:06.871 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know I was drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it comes to sexuality for</v>

1812
01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:13.110
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not responsible for your actions.</v>

1813
01:21:13.111 --> 01:21:14.580
<v Speaker 3>If you're intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you are.</v>

1814
01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:15.720
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have the right pissed,</v>

1815
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:19.230
<v Speaker 3>not just not the right p,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know that women were saying this is part</v>

1816
01:21:19.231 --> 01:21:24.231
<v Speaker 3>of the argument that of man fucks you</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's drunk and you're sober.</v>

1817
01:21:24.540 --> 01:21:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Even though he's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the proactive one,</v>

1818
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:28.580
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That he's being.</v>

1819
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:30.600
<v Speaker 3>He's being raped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1820
01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:35.340
<v Speaker 3>That sex with a drunk person is rape</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they cannot consent.</v>

1821
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Well then you might as well just as you</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

1822
01:21:36.811 --> 01:21:39.000
<v Speaker 3>make every single activity that you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>while drunk,</v>

1823
01:21:39.210 --> 01:21:43.110
<v Speaker 3>but the real problem becomes it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>an attack on men because it's very,</v>

1824
01:21:43.111 --> 01:21:46.680
<v Speaker 3>very rare that any woman ever gets in</v>
<v Speaker 3>trouble for having sex with a man that's</v>

1825
01:21:46.681 --> 01:21:50.010
<v Speaker 3>drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but women and men have both been drunk</v>

1826
01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.040
<v Speaker 3>and the men have been accused of being</v>
<v Speaker 3>rapist.</v>

1827
01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:55.990
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a woman wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the Occidental University then.</v>

1828
01:21:55.991 --> 01:21:56.824
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1829
01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:58.800
<v Speaker 3>College or university?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

1830
01:21:58.801 --> 01:21:59.960
<v Speaker 3>College College,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

1831
01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:00.813
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>

1832
01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:03.150
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that was the guy suing and</v>

1833
01:22:03.151 --> 01:22:03.550
<v Speaker 3>frustrated.</v>

1834
01:22:03.550 --> 01:22:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Let me so much because this is one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those areas where like Islam or like</v>

1835
01:22:07.301 --> 01:22:09.130
<v Speaker 2>political correctness or like black</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives matter.</v>

1836
01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I feel like the moment you try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>introduce nuance you can be very quickly</v>

1837
01:22:13.301 --> 01:22:16.930
<v Speaker 2>taken out of context and accused of</v>
<v Speaker 2>being pro that thing like 100 percent,</v>

1838
01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:18.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'll say something like this and</v>

1839
01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:21.100
<v Speaker 2>then peer supporters of mine on twitter</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be like,</v>

1840
01:22:21.101 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like fuck her.</v>

1841
01:22:22.621 --> 01:22:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1842
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:23.800
<v Speaker 2>let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1843
01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:27.430
<v Speaker 2>but the day that is not what I'm saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whatsoever.</v>

1844
01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:30.350
<v Speaker 3>That's why it's horrific that they can</v>
<v Speaker 3>take what you're doing right now and</v>

1845
01:22:30.351 --> 01:22:32.420
<v Speaker 3>take it and make a little youtube clip</v>
<v Speaker 3>out of it.</v>

1846
01:22:32.450 --> 01:22:36.320
<v Speaker 3>Take that clip and put a title on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Josh Zap thinks rapes.</v>

1847
01:22:36.321 --> 01:22:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1848
01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.480
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really not.</v>

1849
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:40.670
<v Speaker 3>I do think it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1850
01:22:40.671 --> 01:22:42.530
<v Speaker 3>I encourage everybody to go out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>write</v>

1851
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:48.250
<v Speaker 3>a</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>

1852
01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:49.610
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no place for jokes.</v>

1853
01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:50.390
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1854
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:51.650
<v Speaker 3>no more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No more jokes.</v>

1855
01:22:51.651 --> 01:22:52.660
<v Speaker 3>But a Dojo.</v>

1856
01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:53.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If like if,</v>

1857
01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:58.260
<v Speaker 2>if I were to say for example that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>preying upon somebody,</v>

1858
01:22:58.261 --> 01:23:03.240
<v Speaker 2>praying upon a woman with like a knife</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forcing her against her will to have</v>

1859
01:23:03.241 --> 01:23:08.241
<v Speaker 2>sex with you is a class of behavior then</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming in an unconscious in your</v>

1860
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:14.460
<v Speaker 2>unconscious girlfriend's mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that like is that,</v>

1861
01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.270
<v Speaker 2>is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have we gotten to a stage where it's</v>

1862
01:23:16.271 --> 01:23:19.420
<v Speaker 2>just not possible to even talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because we just have to keep</v>

1863
01:23:19.421 --> 01:23:22.810
<v Speaker 2>mouthing the slogan of sexual violence</v>
<v Speaker 2>is unacceptable all the time.</v>

1864
01:23:22.811 --> 01:23:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Therefore there's no way of even</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinguishing in the law between</v>

1865
01:23:25.991 --> 01:23:27.370
<v Speaker 2>different levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1866
01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.460
<v Speaker 2>someone who had a boyfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 17 year old boyfriend who makes a</v>

1867
01:23:30.461 --> 01:23:32.440
<v Speaker 2>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should go to jail for just the same</v>

1868
01:23:32.441 --> 01:23:37.390
<v Speaker 2>length of time as a repeat serial</v>
<v Speaker 2>Predator who preys upon women.</v>

1869
01:23:37.770 --> 01:23:39.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't want to admit that there is any</v>

1870
01:23:39.871 --> 01:23:43.950
<v Speaker 3>difference and that all these things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly the same and one of the reasons</v>

1871
01:23:43.951 --> 01:23:47.130
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because because what you just said,</v>

1872
01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.860
<v Speaker 3>just even introducing it as a</v>
<v Speaker 3>possibility.</v>

1873
01:23:49.861 --> 01:23:53.190
<v Speaker 3>Like there might be a variation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There might be a there,</v>

1874
01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:56.910
<v Speaker 3>there might be a grade of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a level 10 rate,</v>

1875
01:23:56.911 --> 01:23:58.890
<v Speaker 3>but this is a level nine rape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is level eight.</v>

1876
01:23:59.340 --> 01:23:59.731
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1877
01:23:59.731 --> 01:24:00.091
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1878
01:24:00.091 --> 01:24:00.491
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

1879
01:24:00.491 --> 01:24:00.931
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

1880
01:24:00.931 --> 01:24:04.170
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you start getting into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you're a rape apologist</v>

1881
01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:08.220
<v Speaker 3>or you a rape supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or we want to be able to boil things</v>

1882
01:24:08.221 --> 01:24:12.060
<v Speaker 3>until fucking headline a clickbait</v>
<v Speaker 3>headline and spit it out there.</v>

1883
01:24:12.061 --> 01:24:14.490
<v Speaker 3>Here's my thoughts on rape,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1884
01:24:14.491 --> 01:24:19.110
<v Speaker 3>and that's why the idea of everyone</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's drunk is getting raped is so</v>

1885
01:24:19.111 --> 01:24:23.700
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous because it's like we've all</v>
<v Speaker 3>been with someone that we love and we</v>

1886
01:24:23.701 --> 01:24:26.190
<v Speaker 3>got drunk and we wanted to have sex with</v>
<v Speaker 3>them when we did.</v>

1887
01:24:26.370 --> 01:24:27.130
<v Speaker 3>No one got raped.</v>

1888
01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not only ridiculous,</v>

1889
01:24:28.331 --> 01:24:30.970
<v Speaker 2>it's also demeaning to the victims of</v>
<v Speaker 2>really terrible,</v>

1890
01:24:30.971 --> 01:24:31.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1891
01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.021
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1892
01:24:32.021 --> 01:24:36.280
<v Speaker 2>it's also diminishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their legitimate concern.</v>

1893
01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:40.550
<v Speaker 3>It's also insanely sexist because it</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows women as being these people that</v>

1894
01:24:40.551 --> 01:24:43.340
<v Speaker 3>can't make good decisions while they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>intoxicated.</v>

1895
01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the men know exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing,</v>

1896
01:24:45.561 --> 01:24:48.290
<v Speaker 3>so they raped the woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the man and the women,</v>

1897
01:24:48.291 --> 01:24:50.210
<v Speaker 3>even though they're both engaging in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exact same,</v>

1898
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:54.080
<v Speaker 3>the exact same act,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both saying they want to do it.</v>

1899
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.020
<v Speaker 3>The man is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the attacker.</v>

1900
01:24:57.470 --> 01:25:00.310
<v Speaker 3>Whereas the woman is an innocent person</v>
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't know any better because</v>

1901
01:25:00.311 --> 01:25:01.040
<v Speaker 3>she's drunk.</v>

1902
01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.860
<v Speaker 2>There was a pace on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was waiting on the plane in the Sunday</v>

1903
01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:04.461
<v Speaker 2>Times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1904
01:25:04.461 --> 01:25:08.360
<v Speaker 2>yesterday about the woods survivor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the woods survivor has been,</v>

1905
01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:09.830
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is getting used now.</v>

1906
01:25:09.831 --> 01:25:12.400
<v Speaker 2>It was really interesting patients in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the New York Times magazine almost with</v>

1907
01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:14.480
<v Speaker 2>survivor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am.</v>

1908
01:25:14.481 --> 01:25:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I had the flu and they were making the</v>
<v Speaker 2>point that like when everything,</v>

1909
01:25:18.770 --> 01:25:22.160
<v Speaker 2>when every act of sexual violence gets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets labeled with,</v>

1910
01:25:22.161 --> 01:25:25.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm a survivor of sexual violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if that was just unwanted touching</v>

1911
01:25:25.641 --> 01:25:27.860
<v Speaker 2>on the subway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then like,</v>

1912
01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:30.590
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean you survived it?</v>

1913
01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.690
<v Speaker 2>Were you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you ever going to die because</v>

1914
01:25:32.691 --> 01:25:34.910
<v Speaker 2>someone likes slapped you on the ass in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the workplace?</v>

1915
01:25:35.150 --> 01:25:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Not to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to say that it's okay to do that,</v>

1916
01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:39.770
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just compressing all of the</v>

1917
01:25:39.771 --> 01:25:44.771
<v Speaker 2>actual real horrifying survival stories</v>
<v Speaker 2>down to the level of someone looked at</v>

1918
01:25:45.591 --> 01:25:46.424
<v Speaker 2>me funny and</v>

1919
01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't call it survival,</v>

1920
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:51.400
<v Speaker 3>but you're a victim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1921
01:25:51.550 --> 01:25:53.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bit survivor sounds better.</v>

1922
01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.140
<v Speaker 3>It sounds much use.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're barely made it.</v>

1923
01:25:57.490 --> 01:26:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Survivor of bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that someone someone wrote were a</v>

1924
01:26:00.281 --> 01:26:02.590
<v Speaker 3>survivor of high school bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1925
01:26:02.710 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck happened to you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

1926
01:26:04.311 --> 01:26:06.680
<v Speaker 3>What was so bad?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did someone try to stab you?</v>

1927
01:26:06.681 --> 01:26:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Did somebody beat you up to the point of</v>
<v Speaker 3>view almost dying or did someone just</v>

1928
01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:12.350
<v Speaker 3>annoy you all the time and make you feel</v>
<v Speaker 3>bad?</v>

1929
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.230
<v Speaker 3>Is that what happened?</v>

1930
01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:15.060
<v Speaker 2>There are a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are only a few scenarios in which</v>

1931
01:26:15.061 --> 01:26:16.980
<v Speaker 2>I think you should legitimately be</v>
<v Speaker 2>called a survivor.</v>

1932
01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:19.690
<v Speaker 2>A bear attack wouldn't be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shark attack,</v>

1933
01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:20.970
<v Speaker 2>shark attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one.</v>

1934
01:26:20.971 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Basically any kind of large carnivorous</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal attacking you online.</v>

1935
01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:26.800
<v Speaker 2>You man done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go through it,</v>

1936
01:26:26.801 --> 01:26:30.960
<v Speaker 2>but through them all tiger or leopard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey.</v>

1937
01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.890
<v Speaker 2>Mayor Killed by monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1938
01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:37.630
<v Speaker 2>She here that maybe we'll the olive</v>
<v Speaker 2>African,</v>

1939
01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:39.300
<v Speaker 2>African elephants are going to be dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 20 years.</v>

1940
01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.850
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was reading an article.</v>

1941
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:44.490
<v Speaker 2>They were saying there's places in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa that have so many elephants.</v>

1942
01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 2>They have to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:26:45.630 --> 01:26:47.340
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is enormous.</v>

1944
01:26:47.341 --> 01:26:50.010
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand.</v>

1945
01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:55.230
<v Speaker 2>Why is he in an area of Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa itself is fucking huge.</v>

1946
01:26:55.231 --> 01:26:56.820
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's a conference with all of the</v>

1947
01:26:56.821 --> 01:26:57.840
<v Speaker 2>people who are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

1948
01:26:57.990 --> 01:27:00.030
<v Speaker 2>No magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>African Americans could be extinct</v>

1949
01:27:00.031 --> 01:27:00.840
<v Speaker 2>within 20 days</v>

1950
01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:03.510
<v Speaker 3>if poaching maybe</v>

1951
01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:04.730
<v Speaker 2>because all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1952
01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:08.090
<v Speaker 2>there's a conference of African leaders</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the moment going on to figure out how</v>

1953
01:27:08.091 --> 01:27:08.720
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1954
01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.670
<v Speaker 2>they can tackle poaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1955
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:13.320
<v Speaker 2>But Africa is a continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

1956
01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Enormous city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's bigger than almost all the</v>

1957
01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:18.200
<v Speaker 2>continents combined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1958
01:27:18.201 --> 01:27:21.020
<v Speaker 2>But if you keep killing them at a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>larger rate than they procreate,</v>

1959
01:27:21.021 --> 01:27:22.910
<v Speaker 2>so over time you're going to wipe them</v>
<v Speaker 2>all out.</v>

1960
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:25.700
<v Speaker 3>What's scary is people are still hunting</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1961
01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On top of the poaching.</v>

1962
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's these places that develop</v>

1963
01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.190
<v Speaker 3>African hunting safaris for elephants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they raise elephants in these high</v>

1964
01:27:37.191 --> 01:27:41.780
<v Speaker 3>fence operations just so people can go</v>
<v Speaker 3>over there and hunt them and that's one</v>

1965
01:27:41.781 --> 01:27:44.600
<v Speaker 3>of the ways that they ensure that their</v>
<v Speaker 3>population stay high.</v>

1966
01:27:44.601 --> 01:27:46.290
<v Speaker 3>It's very fucking twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1967
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Trump's kids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've seen those photos of trump's sons</v>

1968
01:27:48.791 --> 01:27:51.150
<v Speaker 2>holding our son Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holding up Jaguars and yeah,</v>

1969
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:53.410
<v Speaker 3>that whole African hunting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I.</v>

1970
01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I tell people if you think it's bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 3>with from a cursory glance,</v>

1971
01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:03.760
<v Speaker 3>you gotta look at Luther's documentary</v>
<v Speaker 3>about these</v>

1972
01:28:03.990 --> 01:28:05.610
<v Speaker 2>good honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We mentioned this before because I've</v>

1973
01:28:05.611 --> 01:28:08.430
<v Speaker 2>been a fan since day since day one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>

1974
01:28:08.431 --> 01:28:09.540
<v Speaker 2>that episode is just</v>

1975
01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:11.380
<v Speaker 3>killer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one's nuts.</v>

1976
01:28:11.381 --> 01:28:13.720
<v Speaker 3>I love the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When the guy's going crazy,</v>

1977
01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:15.460
<v Speaker 3>you need to ask him all the questions</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like Africa,</v>

1978
01:28:15.461 --> 01:28:16.600
<v Speaker 3>he's fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked.</v>

1979
01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.630
<v Speaker 3>He's fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't understand content.</v>

1980
01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:21.880
<v Speaker 3>It is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he was saying that,</v>

1981
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:25.600
<v Speaker 3>really kind of get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate that term.</v>

1982
01:28:25.601 --> 01:28:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Poacher two poachers that dark term</v>
<v Speaker 3>because a lot of those people that are</v>

1983
01:28:30.011 --> 01:28:34.210
<v Speaker 3>poaching or just fucking starving,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're poor as fuck.</v>

1984
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:36.850
<v Speaker 3>We have this idea that these are like</v>
<v Speaker 3>these mercenaries that come over to</v>

1985
01:28:36.851 --> 01:28:39.220
<v Speaker 3>steal ivory so they can make money off</v>
<v Speaker 3>of it.</v>

1986
01:28:39.221 --> 01:28:41.770
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are killing</v>
<v Speaker 3>these animals that are homeless,</v>

1987
01:28:41.771 --> 01:28:45.190
<v Speaker 3>have no way out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing there for them.</v>

1988
01:28:45.191 --> 01:28:46.960
<v Speaker 3>They don't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not educated.</v>

1989
01:28:47.230 --> 01:28:48.940
<v Speaker 3>They're just starving and someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1990
01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:51.670
<v Speaker 3>you give me that Rhino Horn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you 500 bucks,</v>

1991
01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.110
<v Speaker 3>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1992
01:28:53.111 --> 01:28:56.410
<v Speaker 3>500 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they'll kill as many rhinos as</v>

1993
01:28:56.411 --> 01:28:57.610
<v Speaker 3>they can before they get killed.</v>

1994
01:28:57.610 --> 01:29:00.940
<v Speaker 3>It's so dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who went over there.</v>

1995
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:06.350
<v Speaker 3>You went over there to Africa and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>said he was on a hunting safari where</v>

1996
01:29:08.670 --> 01:29:13.670
<v Speaker 3>they have these enormous places where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have these hunting camps where</v>

1997
01:29:14.190 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 3>there it's a 10 hour drive to the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>side of the ranch.</v>

1998
01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:21.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enormous territory and while they were</v>

1999
01:29:21.391 --> 01:29:24.270
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they encountered these quote unquote</v>

2000
01:29:24.271 --> 01:29:29.230
<v Speaker 3>poachers and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people from the honey cam just shoot</v>

2001
01:29:29.231 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The poachers,</v>

2002
01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 3>they just shoot at them like the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coyotes.</v>

2003
01:29:32.730 --> 01:29:34.590
<v Speaker 3>They shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These people like,</v>

2004
01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean they don't even give them a</v>
<v Speaker 3>chance,</v>

2005
01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:39.600
<v Speaker 3>they just shoot at them and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>allowed to.</v>

2006
01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:41.580
<v Speaker 3>It's illegal and when they shoot</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

2007
01:29:41.670 --> 01:29:43.920
<v Speaker 3>he asked him like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you do if you kill someone?</v>

2008
01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:47.020
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the time we let the hyenas</v>

2009
01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.820
<v Speaker 3>sorted out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time we let the hyenas</v>

2010
01:29:50.821 --> 01:29:53.730
<v Speaker 3>short.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me just think about how fucking</v>

2011
01:29:53.731 --> 01:29:58.731
<v Speaker 3>crazy life is in that part of the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that this guy is actually saying that</v>

2012
01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:03.090
<v Speaker 3>we're pretty fucking lucky and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>guessing that trump's kids are probably</v>

2013
01:30:03.091 --> 01:30:05.550
<v Speaker 3>not that poor that they need to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting that way.</v>

2014
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.820
<v Speaker 3>They're over there doing those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2015
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:09.360
<v Speaker 3>big game so far.</v>

2016
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's one is a photo of one of them</v>

2017
01:30:10.871 --> 01:30:13.600
<v Speaker 2>holding up an elephant's trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the,</v>

2018
01:30:13.630 --> 01:30:16.440
<v Speaker 2>just the dismembered trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a big old nose just hanging in</v>

<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2020
01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.980

<v Speaker 2>pull that up.</v>

2021
01:30:21.030 --> 01:30:22.230
<v Speaker 3>I want to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2022
01:30:22.290 --> 01:30:24.300

2023
01:30:24.301 --> 01:30:27.030
<v Speaker 3>elephants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain areas that have infiltrated</v>

2024
01:30:27.031 --> 01:30:32.031
<v Speaker 3>these villages and start killing people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the question is what,</v>

<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how fucked with did they get before they</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like what's the actual reality?</v>

2027
01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:39.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean as you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So we're doing this as well.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was just in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

2031
01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:47.510
<v Speaker 2>when I was coming back from Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spent a week in India and uh,</v>

2032
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:51.810
<v Speaker 2>in Mumbai did,</v>

2033
01:30:51.811 --> 01:30:55.680
<v Speaker 2>of the biggest slum in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the kind of slumdog millionaire</v>

2034
01:30:55.980 --> 01:30:56.701
<v Speaker 2>slum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

2035
01:30:56.701 --> 01:30:59.610
<v Speaker 2>and they work in development there with</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the poorest people in the world.</v>

2036
01:30:59.970 --> 01:31:01.950
<v Speaker 2>There's an area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an area of the site,</v>

<v Speaker 2>world and it's an area the size of half</v>

<v Speaker 2>the size of central park and it's got</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 2 million people living in it.</v>

2052
01:31:52.661 --> 01:31:55.150
<v Speaker 3>shit where you go to the supermarket and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you buy a chicken breast.</v>

2053
01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:59.070
<v Speaker 3>A wish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So out of touch touch the most recent of</v>

2054
01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:01.690
<v Speaker 3>recent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's one of the more amazing</v>

2055
01:32:01.691 --> 01:32:04.300
<v Speaker 3>things about how upset people are about</v>
<v Speaker 3>how life is today.</v>

2056
01:32:04.301 --> 01:32:06.560
<v Speaker 3>Like God damn it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the easiest it's ever been ever.</v>

2057
01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.850
<v Speaker 3>This is the greatest time in the history</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the world.</v>

2058
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:11.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everyone's.</v>

2059
01:32:11.231 --> 01:32:12.370
<v Speaker 3>The Sky's falling</v>

2060
01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:15.110
<v Speaker 2>when we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as our lives get better and better,</v>

2061
01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:18.380
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fail to accurately calibrate like</v>

2062
01:32:18.381 --> 01:32:19.460
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any benchmark.</v>

2063
01:32:19.461 --> 01:32:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Like you always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there was a study that came</v>

2064
01:32:21.891 --> 01:32:26.891
<v Speaker 2>out that 47 percent of Americans could</v>
<v Speaker 2>not come up with $400 if they needed to.</v>

2065
01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.260
<v Speaker 2>If they suddenly got an unexpected bill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2066
01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:33.260
<v Speaker 2>Almost half of Americans in other words</v>
<v Speaker 2>are right on the brink of the poverty</v>

2067
01:32:33.261 --> 01:32:35.930
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in terms of just being able to come</v>

2068
01:32:35.931 --> 01:32:38.930
<v Speaker 2>up with cash,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how do we get into and get ourselves</v>

2069
01:32:38.931 --> 01:32:40.300
<v Speaker 2>into that scenario?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

2070
01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:44.180
<v Speaker 2>we fail to recognize how prosperous we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

2071
01:32:44.181 --> 01:32:45.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if most of the people who are listening</v>

2072
01:32:45.651 --> 01:32:49.580
<v Speaker 2>to this podcast are in the top five</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent of income earners globally,</v>

2073
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:54.030
<v Speaker 2>more than a lot of them will be in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top one percent and the top one percent,</v>

2074
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:58.040
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>34 grand a year of global global</v>

2075
01:32:58.041 --> 01:32:58.874
<v Speaker 2>incomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it?</v>

2076
01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.810
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>

2077
01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:04.250
<v Speaker 2>And even even within the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the top five percent is,</v>

2078
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:07.370
<v Speaker 2>is surprisingly low.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 50 grand or something.</v>

2079
01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:08.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more than that,</v>

2080
01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:12.210
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's like mm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was either way.</v>

2081
01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are incredibly blessed and amazingly</v>

2082
01:33:16.071 --> 01:33:20.210
<v Speaker 2>fortunate and it's so hard to snip</v>
<v Speaker 2>hassles out of our complacency and</v>

2083
01:33:20.211 --> 01:33:23.570
<v Speaker 2>realize fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things actually are surprisingly</v>

2084
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:27.290
<v Speaker 2>convenient and easy for us.</v>

2085
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:30.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna stop whining overall,</v>

2086
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:31.760
<v Speaker 3>but if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of those people that can't come up</v>

2087
01:33:31.761 --> 01:33:34.460
<v Speaker 3>with that 400 bucks and the $400 bill</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes,</v>

2088
01:33:34.461 --> 01:33:35.370
<v Speaker 3>it seems daunting.</v>

2089
01:33:35.500 --> 01:33:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not blaming,</v>

2090
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 2>blaming people for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in,</v>

2091
01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:41.290
<v Speaker 2>I've had times in my life where I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been below,</v>

2092
01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:43.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wellwell onto water.</v>

2093
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:44.230
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all have.</v>

2094
01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:47.110
<v Speaker 3>But I think that's also probably one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reasons why you became ambitious and</v>

2095
01:33:47.111 --> 01:33:50.110
<v Speaker 3>why you worked hard and why you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>position right now where you don't have</v>

2096
01:33:50.111 --> 01:33:51.160
<v Speaker 3>to worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2097
01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Because you worked your way through it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you figure your way through</v>

2098
01:33:53.891 --> 01:33:55.030
<v Speaker 3>adversity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2099
01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.870
<v Speaker 3>has an interesting subject because,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2100
01:33:58.270 --> 01:34:01.150
<v Speaker 3>I had uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Wong in really recently and he</v>

2101
01:34:01.151 --> 01:34:03.010
<v Speaker 3>brought up something that I thought was</v>
<v Speaker 3>preposterous.</v>

2102
01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:05.900
<v Speaker 3>He brought up the idea of what do they</v>
<v Speaker 3>call it,</v>

2103
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:10.390
<v Speaker 3>basic income where you give people</v>
<v Speaker 3>$35,000 a year to live.</v>

2104
01:34:10.391 --> 01:34:11.860
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2105
01:34:12.190 --> 01:34:15.910
<v Speaker 3>But then I started looking into it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I started looking into it,</v>

2106
01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:18.610
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that I was intrigued</v>
<v Speaker 3>by was like,</v>

2107
01:34:18.611 --> 01:34:22.690
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of crime and how much of</v>

2108
01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:27.691
<v Speaker 3>people's aberrant behavior could be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could write it off to them being</v>

2109
01:34:29.411 --> 01:34:34.411
<v Speaker 3>desperate and needy and poor and feeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopeless and how much of that crime</v>

2110
01:34:35.681 --> 01:34:40.360
<v Speaker 3>would not take place if they got $35,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year and if these are people that are</v>

2111
01:34:40.361 --> 01:34:43.510
<v Speaker 3>just going to fuck off anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this way they're gonna fuck off,</v>

2112
01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:46.270
<v Speaker 3>but they won't be committing crime</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they're going to have a steady</v>

2113
01:34:46.271 --> 01:34:48.010
<v Speaker 3>income for the rest of their life.</v>

2114
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 3>Is that feasible?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how much money is there out there?</v>

2115
01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:56.290
<v Speaker 3>Could you give everybody in America</v>
<v Speaker 3>$35,000 a year up to a certain number,</v>

2116
01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:57.990
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you hit a cutoff,</v>

2117
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:00.950
<v Speaker 2>like you hit like I would say like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>quarter million dollars a year,</v>

2118
01:35:00.951 --> 01:35:03.160
<v Speaker 2>you don't get the 35 grand anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you have plenty of money.</v>

2119
01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.230
<v Speaker 2>Here's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing that the great utility</v>

2120
01:35:06.231 --> 01:35:09.320
<v Speaker 2>of a basic income is that you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fill out forms and prove that you</v>

2121
01:35:09.321 --> 01:35:11.350
<v Speaker 2>deserve it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that everybody gets it because it's so.</v>

2122
01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's super,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super simple.</v>

2123
01:35:12.471 --> 01:35:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Where's it coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2124
01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't start with $35,000 a year,</v>

2125
01:35:16.100 --> 01:35:18.620
<v Speaker 2>but you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard proposals,</v>

2126
01:35:18.650 --> 01:35:20.270
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alaska has this already.</v>

2127
01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:25.400
<v Speaker 2>They just call it an oil revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone in Alaska gets a check from the</v>

2128
01:35:25.761 --> 01:35:28.760
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a cut of Alaska's oil revenue.</v>

2129
01:35:28.761 --> 01:35:30.980
<v Speaker 2>They basically get a universal basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>income.</v>

2130
01:35:30.981 --> 01:35:33.350
<v Speaker 2>It's not nearly enough to live on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might be a thousand dollars a year or</v>

2131
01:35:33.351 --> 01:35:34.940
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be corrected on this,</v>

2132
01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:39.170
<v Speaker 2>but there are all kinds of experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had Felix Salmon on my podcast.</v>

2133
01:35:39.170 --> 01:35:40.490
<v Speaker 2>Who's at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's over at slate?</v>

2134
01:35:40.491 --> 01:35:41.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a.</v>

2135
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:42.770
<v Speaker 2>he's a money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A big,</v>

2136
01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:46.030
<v Speaker 2>very interesting money guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has a podcast called the money put</v>

2137
01:35:46.100 --> 01:35:49.830
<v Speaker 2>the slate money podcast and he's a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>advocate of this idea and there's a.</v>

2138
01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:51.621
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should.</v>

2139
01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:53.420
<v Speaker 2>You should get him on and he's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's based out of New York,</v>

2140
01:35:53.421 --> 01:35:56.090
<v Speaker 2>but he's Felix Salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the fish,</v>

2141
01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:57.510
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send you his.</v>

2142
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:59.960
<v Speaker 2>I'll text you his details after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the show.</v>

2143
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:02.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a note to myself right now.</v>

2144
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:06.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that he was basically saying there's</v>

2145
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:09.650
<v Speaker 2>a place in like there's a jurisdiction</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think Finland or Sweden,</v>

2146
01:36:09.651 --> 01:36:13.400
<v Speaker 2>which has actually trying this out just</v>
<v Speaker 2>to test the proposition of like how much</v>

2147
01:36:13.401 --> 01:36:17.780
<v Speaker 2>less will people actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If everyone gets a basic income,</v>

2148
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:21.740
<v Speaker 2>how much of a deterrent will it be</v>
<v Speaker 2>bothering to get a job?</v>

2149
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:23.260
<v Speaker 2>How much will it cost?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2150
01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:27.350
<v Speaker 2>$35,000 a year would be would be a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of money.</v>

2151
01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,000 times 300 million</v>

2152
01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.910
<v Speaker 2>is the thing you would start.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It are a lot of savings,</v>

2153
01:36:37.911 --> 01:36:39.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's the weird thing about this</v>

2154
01:36:39.621 --> 01:36:42.890
<v Speaker 2>idea is that libertarians like it as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as progressives because for</v>

2155
01:36:42.891 --> 01:36:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a way of getting rid of social</v>

2156
01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:46.040
<v Speaker 2>security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of Medicare,</v>

2157
01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:48.470
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of food stamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting rid of all of these different</v>

2158
01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:50.930
<v Speaker 2>programs and streamlining everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2159
01:36:50.931 --> 01:36:54.530
<v Speaker 2>think of how hard it is to do your taxes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to like to fill in the forms and to</v>

2160
01:36:54.531 --> 01:36:58.130
<v Speaker 2>figure out what you're supposed to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This would just be a check from the</v>

2161
01:36:58.131 --> 01:36:59.360
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody gets it,</v>

2162
01:36:59.390 --> 01:37:02.210
<v Speaker 2>no questions asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go out and you buy what you need to</v>

2163
01:37:02.211 --> 01:37:04.610
<v Speaker 2>buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now with healthcare is expensive as it</v>

2164
01:37:04.611 --> 01:37:07.400
<v Speaker 2>is in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to work for old people.</v>

2165
01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.250
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be able to pay for our</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare and health insurance and also</v>

2166
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:12.890
<v Speaker 2>social security and also survive on</v>
<v Speaker 2>$35,000 a year,</v>

2167
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:15.920
<v Speaker 2>but if you just thinking in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>budget,</v>

2168
01:37:16.190 --> 01:37:18.800
<v Speaker 2>if you got rid of those massive line</v>
<v Speaker 2>items in the budget,</v>

2169
01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:22.550
<v Speaker 2>medicare and social security and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you will be able to start to think</v>

2170
01:37:22.551 --> 01:37:25.550
<v Speaker 2>about affording things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might start with just $10,000 a</v>

2171
01:37:25.551 --> 01:37:30.551
<v Speaker 2>year for everybody and work your way up</v>
<v Speaker 2>from there and just test it.</v>

2172
01:37:30.651 --> 01:37:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I think a stat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the states should start</v>

2173
01:37:32.601 --> 01:37:35.630
<v Speaker 2>to do it on a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a more aggressive level,</v>

2174
01:37:35.631 --> 01:37:38.780
<v Speaker 2>just like Colorado is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing around with universal healthcare</v>

2175
01:37:39.050 --> 01:37:41.680
<v Speaker 2>at the November election because we'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>

2176
01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:44.450
<v Speaker 2>we'd money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on son.</v>

2177
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:47.070
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's an interesting idea of</v>

2178
01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:51.080
<v Speaker 2>Colorado decided to do that and decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>to give every state resident $35,000 a</v>

2179
01:37:51.081 --> 01:37:53.120
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem would be everybody moved.</v>

2180
01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Everybody moved there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2181
01:37:54.111 --> 01:37:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2182
01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:56.070
<v Speaker 2>but I</v>

2183
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.000
<v Speaker 1>think this is a possible solution to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rise of robots</v>

2184
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:06.510
<v Speaker 1>that's not as crazy as crazy as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like.</v>

2185
01:38:08.611 --> 01:38:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I've just been smoking weed at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2186
01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:16.740
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they were going to be fewer</v>

2187
01:38:16.741 --> 01:38:21.741
<v Speaker 1>and fewer jobs for individual human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings as robots get better and better</v>

2188
01:38:22.201 --> 01:38:23.650
<v Speaker 1>at making shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2189
01:38:23.670 --> 01:38:26.310
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody believes that and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to be cheaper and</v>

2190
01:38:26.311 --> 01:38:27.810
<v Speaker 1>cheaper to get robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2191
01:38:28.110 --> 01:38:31.380
<v Speaker 1>And so what happens when you've got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2192
01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:36.740
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley and Hollywood pumping out</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amounts of stuff which,</v>

2193
01:38:37.230 --> 01:38:41.310
<v Speaker 1>which give us a massive GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A larger GDP growth is still happening,</v>

2194
01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:43.680
<v Speaker 1>but it takes fewer and fewer people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2195
01:38:43.740 --> 01:38:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Uber is a transportation company that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't employ anybody.</v>

2196
01:38:46.531 --> 01:38:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Facebook doesn't employ very many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2197
01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Uber's been challenged on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gets really problematic when you</v>

2198
01:38:51.841 --> 01:38:54.090
<v Speaker 1>deal without the actual labor laws and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2199
01:38:54.090 --> 01:38:56.100
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one particular scenario.</v>

2200
01:38:56.250 --> 01:38:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting is that people are</v>

2201
01:38:59.341 --> 01:39:03.900
<v Speaker 1>gravitating more towards craftsmanship</v>
<v Speaker 1>and crafts and people are gravitating</v>

2202
01:39:03.901 --> 01:39:08.010
<v Speaker 1>towards handmade things and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitating towards things that actually</v>

2203
01:39:08.011 --> 01:39:09.330
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if somebody.</v>

2204
01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Like if I go to a store and I buy a</v>
<v Speaker 1>knife,</v>

2205
01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I buy a kitchen knife,</v>

2206
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:15.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2207
01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.560
<v Speaker 1>it's nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cuts my vegetables.</v>

2208
01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:21.780
<v Speaker 1>But if I know a guy who's a blacksmith</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he actually makes a knife and he and</v>

2209
01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:24.750
<v Speaker 1>he does all this craftsmanship and puts</v>
<v Speaker 1>together the handle.</v>

2210
01:39:24.751 --> 01:39:29.751
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is like there's a feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you get from this object when</v>

2211
01:39:29.851 --> 01:39:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you're using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this is someone's craftsmanship.</v>

2212
01:39:33.091 --> 01:39:36.540
<v Speaker 1>This is someone's creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone learned a trade.</v>

2213
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:41.750
<v Speaker 1>They learned the art form of making a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a functional piece of kitchen ware.</v>

2214
01:39:43.470 --> 01:39:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And I'm using it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But speaking of the 47 percent of people</v>

2215
01:39:46.351 --> 01:39:48.420
<v Speaker 1>who kind of come up with $400,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

2216
01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:50.940
<v Speaker 1>you can afford to care about such</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2217
01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:53.820
<v Speaker 1>but the majority of people are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to buy a pack of steak knives for</v>

2218
01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:55.050
<v Speaker 1>1499 at Walmart.</v>

2219
01:39:55.050 --> 01:39:55.741
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

2220
01:39:55.741 --> 01:39:57.090
<v Speaker 1>But that's also the case with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

2221
01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:59.040
<v Speaker 1>with clothes and with all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

2222
01:39:59.041 --> 01:40:03.230
<v Speaker 1>But for the person themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who learns a trade and someone</v>

2223
01:40:03.231 --> 01:40:04.690
<v Speaker 1>who learns a crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that learns how to make</v>

2224
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:07.410
<v Speaker 1>furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hopefully go more that way and become</v>

2225
01:40:07.411 --> 01:40:11.130
<v Speaker 1>less of a disposable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just China fueled like commodity</v>

2226
01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.970
<v Speaker 1>consuming country and becoming cameron</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the quality of stuff.</v>

2227
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 1>In some ways I think we are for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can afford it.</v>

2228
01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's becoming for the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are looking for something to do</v>

2229
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:25.920
<v Speaker 1>like the that has meaning in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's like extreme meaning and hand</v>

2230
01:40:25.921 --> 01:40:28.920
<v Speaker 1>produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like when you buy something from</v>

2231
01:40:28.921 --> 01:40:31.410
<v Speaker 1>someone like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of office furniture and you</v>

2232
01:40:31.411 --> 01:40:33.620
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy made it like someone made my</v>

2233
01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:36.150
<v Speaker 1>friend Eric made this table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2234
01:40:36.490 --> 01:40:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Unless table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hired them to do it.</v>

2235
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got on your mind.</v>

2236
01:40:39.690 --> 01:40:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the fucking welding and all the</v>

2237
01:40:41.761 --> 01:40:43.800
<v Speaker 1>different shit to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this guy,</v>

2238
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:48.870
<v Speaker 1>he did an awesome job in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in creating this and there's.</v>

2239
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:52.950
<v Speaker 1>There's like something to someone making</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2240
01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:54.460
<v Speaker 1>You're always going to remember</v>

2241
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:55.470
<v Speaker 3>where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2242
01:40:55.471 --> 01:40:56.950
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a cutting board.</v>

2243
01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Somebody puts together a nice hard wood</v>
<v Speaker 3>cutting board,</v>

2244
01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:01.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you like,</v>

2245
01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:02.830
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a guy made this.</v>

2246
01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Well maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then in terms of the question of</v>

2247
01:41:04.821 --> 01:41:06.890
<v Speaker 2>whether or not people can afford to buy</v>
<v Speaker 2>such things,</v>

2248
01:41:06.891 --> 01:41:11.390
<v Speaker 2>maybe the universal basic income means</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we don't necessarily have to all be</v>

2249
01:41:11.450 --> 01:41:13.880
<v Speaker 2>buying those things because the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who make them are going to be getting</v>

2250
01:41:13.881 --> 01:41:17.420
<v Speaker 2>the universal income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the theory which is that the.</v>

2251
01:41:17.421 --> 01:41:21.620
<v Speaker 2>If the overall pie is bigger every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you just have to figure out how to</v>

2252
01:41:21.621 --> 01:41:24.020
<v Speaker 2>allocate the tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Pie.</v>

2253
01:41:24.050 --> 01:41:27.560
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that means that you have to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>super huge taxes on silicon valley in</v>

2254
01:41:27.561 --> 01:41:30.830
<v Speaker 2>some way in order to fund the universal</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic income,</v>

2255
01:41:30.831 --> 01:41:34.940
<v Speaker 2>but if there aren't enough people being</v>
<v Speaker 2>employed to fund what the government</v>

2256
01:41:34.941 --> 01:41:37.670
<v Speaker 2>needs to do on the basis of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conventional income tax,</v>

2257
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:40.820
<v Speaker 2>but there's more stuff being produced</v>
<v Speaker 2>going around,</v>

2258
01:41:40.821 --> 01:41:43.310
<v Speaker 2>there's more wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should still be able to extract that</v>

2259
01:41:43.311 --> 01:41:47.630
<v Speaker 2>well somehow and maybe people can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More people can if everyone got a</v>

2260
01:41:47.631 --> 01:41:50.960
<v Speaker 2>universal basic income and people can</v>
<v Speaker 2>become a poet or an autism,</v>

2261
01:41:50.961 --> 01:41:55.160
<v Speaker 2>all knife maker or a table maker and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't need to necessarily be able</v>

2262
01:41:55.161 --> 01:41:58.040
<v Speaker 2>to sustain their living doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are more opportunities for</v>

2263
01:41:58.041 --> 01:41:58.874
<v Speaker 2>creative</v>

2264
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.360
<v Speaker 3>output.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting to me is that it</v>

2265
01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:05.630
<v Speaker 3>might relax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People I think will certainly.</v>

2266
01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean imagine not having to worry about</v>

2267
01:42:07.671 --> 01:42:08.840
<v Speaker 3>where the next meal comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2268
01:42:08.850 --> 01:42:11.510
<v Speaker 3>that's where it started ringing true to</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2269
01:42:11.511 --> 01:42:13.550
<v Speaker 3>Like I was making fun of Eddie talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>

2270
01:42:13.551 --> 01:42:16.730
<v Speaker 3>but then I thought about it for quite a</v>
<v Speaker 3>while afterwards and then I started</v>

2271
01:42:16.731 --> 01:42:19.670
<v Speaker 3>reading some things on it that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>reinforced these new ideas that I was</v>

2272
01:42:19.671 --> 01:42:23.750
<v Speaker 3>starting to play around with and one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that I was thinking is how</v>

2273
01:42:23.751 --> 01:42:28.490
<v Speaker 3>much of what people do that's fucked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing out of desperation or out</v>

2274
01:42:28.491 --> 01:42:33.230
<v Speaker 3>of frustration and how much could that</v>
<v Speaker 3>be eliminated and how much would that</v>

2275
01:42:33.231 --> 01:42:37.420
<v Speaker 3>change society and are ambitious people</v>
<v Speaker 3>just.</v>

2276
01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:41.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're not talking about anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you could fucking go ball and on</v>

2277
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:43.430
<v Speaker 3>35 grand a year or 12 grand a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you,</v>

2278
01:42:43.670 --> 01:42:47.030
<v Speaker 3>whatever you give them 12 grand a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that you're barely going to</v>

2279
01:42:47.031 --> 01:42:49.310
<v Speaker 3>live off that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have enough money for food.</v>

2280
01:42:49.670 --> 01:42:52.280
<v Speaker 3>You have enough money for food.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully you got enough money for rent.</v>

2281
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:54.470
<v Speaker 3>If you get some part time jobs here are</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

2282
01:42:54.471 --> 01:42:59.471
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully you can survive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're less desperate and more</v>

2283
01:42:59.721 --> 01:43:03.350
<v Speaker 3>dependent upon society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're more dependent upon the rules of</v>

2284
01:43:03.351 --> 01:43:04.080
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>

2285
01:43:04.080 --> 01:43:05.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to see what countries look like</v>

2286
01:43:05.761 --> 01:43:08.790
<v Speaker 2>when that sort of thing happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it's not a perfect analogy,</v>

2287
01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.150
<v Speaker 2>just look at the countries of northern</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe or even you were talking about</v>

2288
01:43:12.151 --> 01:43:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Melbourne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2289
01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:16.560
<v Speaker 2>a country like Australia where it's by</v>
<v Speaker 2>no means perfect.</v>

2290
01:43:16.561 --> 01:43:17.970
<v Speaker 2>There are still poor people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but gee,</v>

2291
01:43:17.971 --> 01:43:21.810
<v Speaker 2>the levels of poverty are a lot less</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they are here and the number of</v>

2292
01:43:21.811 --> 01:43:25.680
<v Speaker 2>people in grinding abject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute poverty is almost nonexistent</v>

2293
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:28.380
<v Speaker 2>in comparison to the way that you see it</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the states because we have</v>

2294
01:43:28.381 --> 01:43:30.330
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have social safety nets that are just</v>

2295
01:43:30.331 --> 01:43:32.820
<v Speaker 2>much more robust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you only have 20 million people,</v>

2296
01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:34.950
<v Speaker 2>but even so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never buy that argument.</v>

2297
01:43:34.980 --> 01:43:36.600
<v Speaker 2>It everything is scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

2298
01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:38.160
<v Speaker 2>The fact that we.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2299
01:43:38.161 --> 01:43:41.190
<v Speaker 2>because we only have 20 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also have a proportionately fewer</v>

2300
01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:42.870
<v Speaker 2>number of taxpayers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have.</v>

2301
01:43:43.170 --> 01:43:45.910
<v Speaker 2>You have tons more people and tons more</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxpayers.</v>

2302
01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:49.300
<v Speaker 2>Like look at Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany's a big country that's.</v>

2303
01:43:49.380 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 2>They've got 80 million people and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>manage to have very,</v>

2304
01:43:52.130 --> 01:43:56.210
<v Speaker 1>very few people basically know people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>abject poverty.</v>

2305
01:43:56.420 --> 01:43:59.570
<v Speaker 1>That might be a bad example because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a mess right now.</v>

2306
01:43:59.630 --> 01:44:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany is a mess with the immigration</v>

2307
01:44:01.701 --> 01:44:03.110
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is separate,</v>

2308
01:44:03.111 --> 01:44:04.590
<v Speaker 1>but they're economy is not a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2309
01:44:04.670 --> 01:44:07.850
<v Speaker 1>but they're socially a massive scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's because of Syria.</v>

2310
01:44:08.090 --> 01:44:08.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2311
01:44:08.421 --> 01:44:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Well there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That whole thing is so bizarre where the</v>

2312
01:44:10.671 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 1>mayor of Munich was telling girls to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep to themselves and not look at</v>

2313
01:44:14.241 --> 01:44:16.000
<v Speaker 1>anybody and it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2314
01:44:16.010 --> 01:44:21.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not advocating that America should</v>
<v Speaker 1>invite a 10 million on stream into</v>

2315
01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:25.070
<v Speaker 1>documented Syrians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking insane.</v>

2316
01:44:25.190 --> 01:44:27.800
<v Speaker 1>But you could certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could certainly imagine a system in</v>

2317
01:44:27.801 --> 01:44:29.890
<v Speaker 1>which it was a lot easier for people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

2318
01:44:29.891 --> 01:44:31.990
<v Speaker 1>You did just didn't have entrenched</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of,</v>

2319
01:44:32.170 --> 01:44:36.500
<v Speaker 1>of grinding poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder what the cost would be and</v>

2320
01:44:36.501 --> 01:44:39.560
<v Speaker 1>what could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a mathematical equation that</v>

2321
01:44:39.561 --> 01:44:41.270
<v Speaker 1>can be worked out where that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

2322
01:44:42.110 --> 01:44:43.010
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2323
01:44:43.011 --> 01:44:46.630
<v Speaker 1>not doing the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Felix Felix will know who's Felix?</v>

2324
01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Felix Salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the English guy who does.</v>

2325
01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:51.270
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like Siri.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2326
01:44:51.410 --> 01:44:54.140
<v Speaker 1>what are you using a windows phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You asked Felix.</v>

2327
01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.760
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like that sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 1>something wholesale Felix's hasn't</v>

2328
01:44:57.770 --> 01:45:00.040
<v Speaker 1>really posh English accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it sounds like the kind of person who</v>

2329
01:45:00.041 --> 01:45:02.810
<v Speaker 1>you who you would expect to voice one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

2330
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:05.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember ask Jeeves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was everybody used to go to that before</v>

2331
01:45:05.781 --> 01:45:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Google was around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know to ask jeeves.</v>

2332
01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:10.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't have a really useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it was.</v>

2333
01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm too young or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it was you typed in [inaudible] dot</v>

2334
01:45:15.141 --> 01:45:16.670
<v Speaker 1>com?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't remember.</v>

2335
01:45:16.671 --> 01:45:18.110
<v Speaker 1>Did you have to phrase things as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>

2336
01:45:18.111 --> 01:45:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Sounds stupid now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2337
01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2338
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:24.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I asked jeeves a few things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't remember what they were.</v>

2339
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:26.620
<v Speaker 1>Now that I'm thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>

2340
01:45:26.630 --> 01:45:28.530
<v Speaker 1>show me boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll james.</v>

2341
01:45:29.450 --> 01:45:31.520

<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>

2342
01:45:31.521 --> 01:45:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Ask Dot com now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2343
01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:35.240
<v Speaker 1>just not asked her a question and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would tell you the answer.</v>

2344
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Where's the tallest waterfall in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2345
01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Ask this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much would it cost to give all</v>

2346
01:45:43.011 --> 01:45:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love saying in dollars.</v>

2347
01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.550
<v Speaker 1>When you're typing then</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2348
01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot Com is not going to help you with</v>

2349
01:45:51.981 --> 01:45:52.641
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2350
01:45:52.641 --> 01:45:54.950
<v Speaker 1>you don't look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would cost 3 trillion to give</v>

2351
01:45:54.951 --> 01:45:59.951
<v Speaker 1>everyone $10,000 a year by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extra two point five and Jesus</v>

2352
01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:03.433
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

2353
01:46:03.860 --> 01:46:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

2354
01:46:04.761 --> 01:46:05.451
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

2355
01:46:05.451 --> 01:46:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Three more than 3 trillion to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>give him 10 grand a.</v>

2356
01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:10.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gs.</v>

2357
01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:13.820
<v Speaker 1>9 trillion plus to give everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>

2358
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:17.960
<v Speaker 1>but you wouldn't give everybody because</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody who makes over a certain</v>

2359
01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:19.700
<v Speaker 1>amount should have to fucking work it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

2360
01:46:19.700 --> 01:46:23.150
<v Speaker 1>But people are so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would just stay under $250,000.</v>

2361
01:46:23.151 --> 01:46:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll make $240.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Give Up,</v>

2362
01:46:26.250 --> 01:46:31.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you let over $1 you would.</v>

2363
01:46:31.611 --> 01:46:33.460
<v Speaker 1>You would have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think if you were gonna start</v>

2364
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:35.450
<v Speaker 1>means testing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you didn't have to be a sliding</v>

2365
01:46:35.451 --> 01:46:37.760
<v Speaker 1>scale so that you didn't encounter that</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

2366
01:46:37.761 --> 01:46:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you hit it to 50 then you only get</v>

2367
01:46:40.041 --> 01:46:42.680
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hit two 60 and they get 25,</v>

2368
01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:46.580
<v Speaker 1>but then it becomes complicated and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that negates a lot of the benefit when</v>

2369
01:46:46.581 --> 01:46:50.100
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about what you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>want is just a wife desperately poor</v>

2370
01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:53.100
<v Speaker 2>people to not be desperately poor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are simpler ways than giving</v>

2371
01:46:53.101 --> 01:46:55.920
<v Speaker 2>everybody a universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are simpler ways,</v>

2372
01:46:56.050 --> 01:47:01.050
<v Speaker 3>but I think the real work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real important thing is figuring out</v>

2373
01:47:01.241 --> 01:47:05.680
<v Speaker 3>a way to stop children from growing up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in desperation to stop children from</v>

2374
01:47:05.681 --> 01:47:08.210
<v Speaker 3>growing up in an environment like a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2375
01:47:08.280 --> 01:47:11.470
<v Speaker 3>this guy on Michael would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to get back to him this week</v>

2376
01:47:11.530 --> 01:47:15.340
<v Speaker 3>because we're working on a new date,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was a Baltimore police officer</v>

2377
01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:20.730
<v Speaker 3>and he talked in great detail about real</v>
<v Speaker 3>institutional racism in Baltimore where</v>

2378
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.360
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2379
01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:29.260
<v Speaker 3>they had literally areas where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't sell black people homes and</v>

2380
01:47:29.261 --> 01:47:31.660
<v Speaker 3>this had been established in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 3>sixties.</v>

2381
01:47:31.930 --> 01:47:35.170
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those areas are still fucked.</v>

2382
01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Those areas like there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're still to this day,</v>

2383
01:47:37.781 --> 01:47:40.360
<v Speaker 3>he found something from the 19</v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies,</v>

2384
01:47:40.690 --> 01:47:41.080
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2385
01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.400
<v Speaker 3>the police officers in his district did</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was like a mandate,</v>

2386
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:48.760
<v Speaker 3>like what they were supposed to do and</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the crime was and he's like,</v>

2387
01:47:48.940 --> 01:47:53.470
<v Speaker 3>it was exactly the same place is exactly</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same crimes as they were dealing</v>

2388
01:47:53.471 --> 01:47:54.760
<v Speaker 3>with in the 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2389
01:47:55.150 --> 01:48:00.150
<v Speaker 3>how few tile and fucking crazy is this</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're dealing with this pattern</v>

2390
01:48:00.370 --> 01:48:03.100
<v Speaker 3>that never gets fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never gets corrected.</v>

2391
01:48:03.250 --> 01:48:04.100
<v Speaker 3>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just,</v>

2392
01:48:04.350 --> 01:48:07.960
<v Speaker 3>cops keep arresting the same people in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same areas for the same problems.</v>

2393
01:48:07.961 --> 01:48:08.830
<v Speaker 3>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2394
01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:10.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done studies about what the most</v>

2395
01:48:10.631 --> 01:48:12.330
<v Speaker 2>effective way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2396
01:48:12.500 --> 01:48:16.240
<v Speaker 2>to help poor people is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>oftentimes people on the left will be,</v>

2397
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:20.560
<v Speaker 2>will be in favor of food stamps or like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit of public schools and so on.</v>

2398
01:48:20.710 --> 01:48:24.640
<v Speaker 2>All of those things are great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of recent research suggests</v>

2399
01:48:24.641 --> 01:48:29.641
<v Speaker 2>that just giving people money is more</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective than trying to figure out all</v>

2400
01:48:29.681 --> 01:48:31.840
<v Speaker 2>of these tweaks because we don't like</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving poor people money because we</v>

2401
01:48:31.841 --> 01:48:32.151
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2402
01:48:32.151 --> 01:48:34.060
<v Speaker 2>they're just gonna spend it on drugs or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they gonna spend it on booze or</v>

2403
01:48:34.061 --> 01:48:35.700
<v Speaker 2>something like that with cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes,</v>

2404
01:48:35.710 --> 01:48:38.320
<v Speaker 2>or food up here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turns out,</v>

2405
01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:41.410
<v Speaker 2>and this applies whether you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about desperately poor people in Africa</v>

2406
01:48:41.650 --> 01:48:43.630
<v Speaker 2>or desperately poor people in downtown</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baltimore.</v>

2407
01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.400
<v Speaker 2>If you give them money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people use it for good ends.</v>

2408
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:51.190
<v Speaker 2>The the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing they really want the most is</v>

2409
01:48:51.191 --> 01:48:56.191
<v Speaker 2>to eat and be able to pay their bills</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to get out of the situation they're</v>

2410
01:48:56.351 --> 01:48:57.970
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A minority of people will spend,</v>

2411
01:48:57.971 --> 01:49:01.900
<v Speaker 2>will blow it on booze and cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are a small minority.</v>

2412
01:49:02.290 --> 01:49:04.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what their needs are more better</v>

2413
01:49:04.121 --> 01:49:07.210
<v Speaker 2>than we know what their needs are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this paternalistic idea that we</v>

2414
01:49:07.211 --> 01:49:08.830
<v Speaker 2>always have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we have to figure out how to get</v>

2415
01:49:08.831 --> 01:49:11.020
<v Speaker 2>people out of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People know how to get themselves out of</v>

2416
01:49:11.021 --> 01:49:12.870
<v Speaker 2>poverty if they just had the resources</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do so,</v>

2417
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:14.020
<v Speaker 2>so just give them a bit of money.</v>

2418
01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also this absolute realization that</v>

2419
01:49:17.901 --> 01:49:21.650
<v Speaker 3>this is not a level playing field and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that someone corn in the slums of</v>

2420
01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Inglewood is not the same as someone who</v>
<v Speaker 3>was born in</v>

2421
01:49:24.890 --> 01:49:28.700
<v Speaker 2>so crazy about libertarians when they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they go on about how everyone</v>

2422
01:49:28.701 --> 01:49:29.770
<v Speaker 2>should be free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2423
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:31.250
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone should be free.</v>

2424
01:49:31.251 --> 01:49:36.251
<v Speaker 2>I am as libertarian as you can get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but within within the understanding that</v>

2425
01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:40.910
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy to say that people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>equally for the person in beverly who's</v>

2426
01:49:40.911 --> 01:49:43.250
<v Speaker 2>born in Beverly hills to a white middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>class.</v>

2427
01:49:43.251 --> 01:49:48.251
<v Speaker 2>Upper class family is only as free as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the baby born in the slums of Baltimore.</v>

2428
01:49:49.751 --> 01:49:51.940
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course you should use the,</v>

2429
01:49:51.970 --> 01:49:52.691
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2430
01:49:52.691 --> 01:49:55.750
<v Speaker 2>the power of the state to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>level the playing field a little bit.</v>

2431
01:49:55.930 --> 01:49:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Just to skim a little bit off the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beverly Hills family and give a little</v>

2432
01:49:58.421 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 2>bit to the Baltimore family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see what's so tyrannical about</v>

2433
01:50:01.541 --> 01:50:02.520
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>

2434
01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:05.060
<v Speaker 3>because you're not coming from an even</v>
<v Speaker 3>start point,</v>

2435
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.841
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2436
01:50:05.841 --> 01:50:10.841
<v Speaker 3>and then there's also this notion that</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a country we were only as strong as</v>

2437
01:50:12.591 --> 01:50:13.790
<v Speaker 3>the weakest link.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2438
01:50:13.970 --> 01:50:18.970
<v Speaker 3>So if we created a system where we had</v>
<v Speaker 3>less people in desperation,</v>

2439
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:21.830
<v Speaker 3>less people in despair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less less losers,</v>

2440
01:50:22.340 --> 01:50:25.580
<v Speaker 3>we would be more winners will get our</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit together,</v>

2441
01:50:25.581 --> 01:50:27.110
<v Speaker 3>we would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would produce more,</v>

2442
01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:29.090
<v Speaker 3>we'd be more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder.</v>

2443
01:50:29.091 --> 01:50:33.470
<v Speaker 3>I just wonder what the actual numbers</v>
<v Speaker 3>are because like how much money is being</v>

2444
01:50:33.471 --> 01:50:35.630
<v Speaker 3>spent every year on things that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>need,</v>

2445
01:50:35.631 --> 01:50:39.200
<v Speaker 3>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much money from our taxes goes to</v>

2446
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:43.970
<v Speaker 3>bureaucracy and bullshit and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>distorted representative government that</v>

2447
01:50:43.971 --> 01:50:46.070
<v Speaker 3>most people don't agree with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much of that,</v>

2448
01:50:46.071 --> 01:50:49.880
<v Speaker 3>how much of it is just fucking cronyism</v>
<v Speaker 3>and handing money back and forth?</v>

2449
01:50:49.930 --> 01:50:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>

2450
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:52.330
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't spend a lot of money and we</v>

2451
01:50:52.331 --> 01:50:56.910
<v Speaker 2>don't spend a lot of money on</v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy and waste in your like</v>

2452
01:50:57.310 --> 01:50:59.260
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People who want to cut government</v>

2453
01:50:59.261 --> 01:51:00.920
<v Speaker 2>spending will often say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2454
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:02.620
<v Speaker 2>first thing I'm going to do when I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

2455
01:51:02.621 --> 01:51:05.560
<v Speaker 2>when I get to Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I'm going to repaint,</v>

2456
01:51:05.610 --> 01:51:07.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my congressional office or something,</v>

2457
01:51:07.451 --> 01:51:08.201
<v Speaker 2>or I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2458
01:51:08.201 --> 01:51:09.034
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>

2459
01:51:09.050 --> 01:51:12.400
<v Speaker 2>Throw out the fancy stuff and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get an old couch like these.</v>

2460
01:51:12.430 --> 01:51:14.440
<v Speaker 2>This is not what we're spending our</v>
<v Speaker 2>money on.</v>

2461
01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:19.540
<v Speaker 2>What we're spending our money on is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>military and Medicare and social</v>

2462
01:51:19.541 --> 01:51:24.541
<v Speaker 2>security basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right in healthcare costs and stopped</v>

2463
01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:27.730
<v Speaker 2>and cut the military and you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the big,</v>

2464
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:29.500
<v Speaker 2>the big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military.</v>

2465
01:51:29.501 --> 01:51:30.580
<v Speaker 2>But then what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>

2466
01:51:30.730 --> 01:51:31.360
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you something.</v>

2467
01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:33.550
<v Speaker 2>Freedom Ain't free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to come over here and take</v>

2468
01:51:33.551 --> 01:51:35.980
<v Speaker 2>our jobs and kick our women into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>curb or something.</v>

2469
01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:37.900
<v Speaker 2>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been having a twitter argument with</v>

2470
01:51:37.901 --> 01:51:39.520
<v Speaker 2>a person who's been saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2471
01:51:39.570 --> 01:51:42.160
<v Speaker 2>that the reason why America's roads are</v>
<v Speaker 2>so bad.</v>

2472
01:51:42.161 --> 01:51:43.780
<v Speaker 2>It's because we spend too much on</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign aid.</v>

2473
01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:44.980
<v Speaker 2>That's may do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

2474
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When am I?</v>

2475
01:51:48.011 --> 01:51:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Just say it because I know Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain spends three or four times more</v>

2476
01:51:52.751 --> 01:51:55.810
<v Speaker 2>per capita on foreign aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sweden spend six times more per capita</v>

2477
01:51:55.811 --> 01:51:57.730
<v Speaker 2>if you've seen the road in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really quite nice.</v>

2478
01:51:58.820 --> 01:52:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have more roads,</v>

2479
01:52:00.191 --> 01:52:01.160
<v Speaker 2>don't we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

2480
01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:03.040
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also have been more mindful.</v>

2481
01:52:03.041 --> 01:52:04.540
<v Speaker 2>You have more tax payers to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2482
01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Just looking at overall numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We spend more money because we have more</v>

2483
01:52:07.091 --> 01:52:08.140
<v Speaker 2>roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2484
01:52:08.141 --> 01:52:10.060
<v Speaker 2>and you spend more money on foreign aid</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well,</v>

2485
01:52:10.061 --> 01:52:11.290
<v Speaker 2>but there were more likely to share it.</v>

2486
01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:13.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm a petroleum trader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to get.</v>

2487
01:52:13.490 --> 01:52:16.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be an egg with the opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's something.</v>

2488
01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:17.400
<v Speaker 2>Here's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a players,</v>

2489
01:52:17.401 --> 01:52:20.500
<v Speaker 2>a reform which you could support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would really help you figure out</v>

2490
01:52:20.501 --> 01:52:21.880
<v Speaker 2>where you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the money goes.</v>

2491
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:25.060
<v Speaker 2>When you get your tax bill at the end of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the year,</v>

2492
01:52:25.120 --> 01:52:29.350
<v Speaker 2>your tax statement from the irs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could as they do in Australia and a</v>

2493
01:52:29.351 --> 01:52:32.110
<v Speaker 2>bunch of other countries have a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bar graph,</v>

2494
01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:36.190
<v Speaker 2>a colorful little graph with lines</v>
<v Speaker 2>showing how much you've spent on</v>

2495
01:52:36.191 --> 01:52:37.660
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in Australia,</v>

2496
01:52:37.950 --> 01:52:40.750
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you paid $18,000 in tax that year,</v>

2497
01:52:41.170 --> 01:52:43.630
<v Speaker 2>then there's a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little purple line on the graph which</v>

2498
01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:44.200
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2499
01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:47.810
<v Speaker 2>you spent four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$782 and sixteen cents on Medicare,</v>

2500
01:52:48.130 --> 01:52:51.170
<v Speaker 2>spent this much on security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend this much on foreign aid and then</v>

2501
01:52:51.171 --> 01:52:52.910
<v Speaker 2>you can actually see it there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

2502
01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:56.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a proposal in front of Congress</v>
<v Speaker 2>which some Democrats are pushing to</v>

2503
01:52:56.931 --> 01:52:57.950
<v Speaker 2>bring this in here.</v>

2504
01:52:58.250 --> 01:53:01.850
<v Speaker 2>And also to streamline the way that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do your taxes because in a lot of other</v>

2505
01:53:01.851 --> 01:53:03.200
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apart from the states,</v>

2506
01:53:03.620 --> 01:53:06.170
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to go through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rigmarole of filling out all of your</v>

2507
01:53:06.171 --> 01:53:07.250
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>

2508
01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:10.400
<v Speaker 2>Because when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do a job and you get a,</v>

2509
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:15.050
<v Speaker 2>you have to supply the irs with a 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>99 or a w two at the end of the year.</v>

2510
01:53:15.650 --> 01:53:17.450
<v Speaker 2>Remember that the person who gave you</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10,</v>

2511
01:53:17.451 --> 01:53:21.080
<v Speaker 2>99 or the w two also sent a copy to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>irs.</v>

2512
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:24.800
<v Speaker 2>The irs already has it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could just fill it out themselves.</v>

2513
01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:28.370
<v Speaker 2>Instead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make you do it and it's difficult</v>

2514
01:53:28.371 --> 01:53:30.710
<v Speaker 2>and cumbersome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in a lot of other countries like the</v>

2515
01:53:30.711 --> 01:53:33.410
<v Speaker 2>UK and Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the option of just signing off</v>

2516
01:53:33.411 --> 01:53:34.161
<v Speaker 2>on it and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2517
01:53:34.161 --> 01:53:34.994
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this looks good.</v>

2518
01:53:35.130 --> 01:53:39.740
<v Speaker 2>You can just do my taxes for me and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the proposals to make to simplify</v>

2519
01:53:39.741 --> 01:53:42.620
<v Speaker 2>doing your taxes are being pushed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>

2520
01:53:42.740 --> 01:53:47.460
<v Speaker 2>And I find it wildly ironic that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who oppose these policies are</v>

2521
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:51.590
<v Speaker 2>Republicans and Grover Norquist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the anti tax crusader who you would</v>

2522
01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:55.340
<v Speaker 2>think would want to make it easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's in their interest to make taxes</v>

2523
01:53:55.550 --> 01:54:00.550
<v Speaker 2>as difficult to do and as difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand as possible because they want</v>

2524
01:54:00.651 --> 01:54:02.780
<v Speaker 2>you to continue hating taxes as much as</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>

2525
01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the republic,</v>

2526
01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:07.420
<v Speaker 2>the military industrial complex that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans essentially work for.</v>

2527
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Don't want you to know how much we spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Pentagon so that they oppose this</v>

2528
01:54:11.181 --> 01:54:14.060
<v Speaker 2>bar graph idea because they know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest line item would be this</v>

2529
01:54:14.061 --> 01:54:17.540
<v Speaker 2>massive thing and you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we really need to be spending that</v>

2530
01:54:17.541 --> 01:54:20.840
<v Speaker 2>much on the military?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or is this really a jobs program where</v>

2531
01:54:20.841 --> 01:54:24.620
<v Speaker 2>we're building nuclear submarines that</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on doesn't want important</v>

2532
01:54:24.621 --> 01:54:26.780
<v Speaker 2>districts in Delaware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delaware,</v>

2533
01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:29.020
<v Speaker 2>just so that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the we,</v>

2534
01:54:29.050 --> 01:54:30.260
<v Speaker 2>we can keep some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some jobs.</v>

2535
01:54:30.261 --> 01:54:32.330
<v Speaker 2>They're in a factory that's producing</v>
<v Speaker 2>munitions that it doesn't,</v>

2536
01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:33.320
<v Speaker 2>does it no longer needs to be?</v>

2537
01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the good things about</v>

2538
01:54:35.441 --> 01:54:38.860
<v Speaker 1>someone proposing something like that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to look at who's opposing it and</v>

2539
01:54:38.861 --> 01:54:41.320
<v Speaker 1>when someone's proposing something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>make sense and it makes it,</v>

2540
01:54:41.321 --> 01:54:45.640
<v Speaker 1>unless there's some sort of exorbitant</v>
<v Speaker 1>fee that's involved in giving people a</v>

2541
01:54:45.641 --> 01:54:47.680
<v Speaker 1>detailed rundown of where their money</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

2542
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:48.820
<v Speaker 1>then you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2543
01:54:48.821 --> 01:54:52.660
<v Speaker 1>someone's against transparency and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're against transparency or against</v>

2544
01:54:52.661 --> 01:54:54.640
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck your against America.</v>

2545
01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Play the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Man,</v>

2546
01:54:56.650 --> 01:54:58.810
<v Speaker 1>the free home of the brave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>

2547
01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:00.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to know where my fucking taxes</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

2548
01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're anti tax,</v>

2549
01:55:03.041 --> 01:55:04.960
<v Speaker 1>then you should be pro transparency and</v>
<v Speaker 1>text.</v>

2550
01:55:04.961 --> 01:55:07.690
<v Speaker 1>We found out my taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to welfare cigarettes.</v>

2551
01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:13.860
<v Speaker 1>That's where they didn't go booze on</v>
<v Speaker 1>pills for the kids.</v>

2552
01:55:14.250 --> 01:55:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:55:15.170 --> 01:55:18.660
<v Speaker 1>Imagine we should spend more on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wonder what the number would be</v>

2554
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:20.090
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do,</v>

2555
01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:21.720
<v Speaker 1>the universal basic income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2556
01:55:21.721 --> 01:55:24.520
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what would the number would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what would be.</v>

2557
01:55:24.610 --> 01:55:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Just try to keep it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you if I got a rant coming on.</v>

2558
01:55:28.730 --> 01:55:30.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you if I got a rant coming on</v>
<v Speaker 1>me right now.</v>

2559
01:55:30.691 --> 01:55:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not feeling that America even better</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I do an Australian accent and you</v>

2560
01:55:34.021 --> 01:55:36.240
<v Speaker 1>play the US national anthem and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds really weird.</v>

2561
01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Cognitive dissonance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

2562
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:41.610
<v Speaker 2>play at Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Play the anthem.</v>

2563
01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Liliana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's just get a little of a bit of</v>

2564
01:55:44.131 --> 01:55:46.890
<v Speaker 2>patriotism going here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mate.</v>

2565
01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:48.900
<v Speaker 2>I want to tell you a thing or two about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2566
01:55:48.930 --> 01:55:51.080
<v Speaker 2>about the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but talking to you.</v>

2567
01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:52.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Overdo it.</v>

2568
01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Can't fake it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

2569
01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is country?</v>

2570
01:55:58.860 --> 01:56:02.940
<v Speaker 2>A Nation of brave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>courageous men and women who fought for</v>

2571
01:56:02.941 --> 01:56:04.320
<v Speaker 2>years now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Centuries.</v>

2572
01:56:04.410 --> 01:56:04.951
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

2573
01:56:04.951 --> 01:56:07.320
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about non binary sexual people,</v>

2574
01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:11.440
<v Speaker 1>men or women?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You being transphobic?</v>

2575
01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're very transphobic.</v>

2576
01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:16.380
<v Speaker 2>Sit on my podcast the other day that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who vote for Hillary because they</v>

2577
01:56:16.381 --> 01:56:19.080
<v Speaker 2>voted because they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because she's a woman only voting for</v>

2578
01:56:19.081 --> 01:56:21.870
<v Speaker 2>her because she's got a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone on twitter said that that was</v>

2579
01:56:21.871 --> 01:56:23.910
<v Speaker 2>transferred it because there are women</v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't have vaginas.</v>

2580
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree.</v>

2581
01:56:26.450 --> 01:56:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an x and a y chromosome.</v>

2582
01:56:28.461 --> 01:56:31.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of genetics you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with being a woman.</v>

2583
01:56:31.230 --> 01:56:33.440
<v Speaker 1>If you've got a dick though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a real problem.</v>

2584
01:56:33.441 --> 01:56:35.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to call them limit if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be called women.</v>

2585
01:56:35.481 --> 01:56:37.060
<v Speaker 1>I really don't have a problem with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't cut.</v>

2586
01:56:37.130 --> 01:56:39.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't call me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not transphobic for me to make a</v>

2587
01:56:39.561 --> 01:56:41.840
<v Speaker 1>generalization that most women have</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaginas.</v>

2588
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw an opening to call you transphobic</v>

2589
01:56:44.631 --> 01:56:47.860
<v Speaker 1>and I jumped on it because it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sank your battleship.</v>

2590
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I got 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it as they're playing games.</v>

2591
01:56:53.091 --> 01:56:54.680
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to have a vagina to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

2592
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>

2593
01:56:56.210 --> 01:56:58.850
<v Speaker 1>How about fuck you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

2594
01:56:59.300 --> 01:57:00.800
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolina law though?</v>

2595
01:57:00.801 --> 01:57:03.470
<v Speaker 1>About this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Mrs the bathroom.</v>

2596
01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm so conflicted about this because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>also,</v>

2597
01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:08.700
<v Speaker 2>I also got into trouble on my podcast</v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking about this.</v>

2598
01:57:08.730 --> 01:57:13.730
<v Speaker 2>So I think it's obviously a silly beat</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and I think that trans people have</v>

2599
01:57:13.801 --> 01:57:17.870
<v Speaker 2>been and will continue to use bathrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2600
01:57:17.970 --> 01:57:20.640
<v Speaker 2>and we shouldn't worry about it and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think that people should be</v>

2601
01:57:20.641 --> 01:57:25.641
<v Speaker 2>passing laws against it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I also think it's disingenuous of</v>

2602
01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Pro Trans people and I regard myself as</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadly pro trans,</v>

2603
01:57:29.341 --> 01:57:31.020
<v Speaker 2>just in the same sense that I'm broadly</v>
<v Speaker 2>pro,</v>

2604
01:57:31.021 --> 01:57:32.190
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever floats your boat,</v>

2605
01:57:32.191 --> 01:57:33.510
<v Speaker 2>just live the life that you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

2606
01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Whoever you as do our.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2607
01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's disingenuous when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>start saying that people who have the</v>

2608
01:57:39.091 --> 01:57:44.091
<v Speaker 2>outward appearance of the gender on</v>
<v Speaker 2>their birth certificate should be able</v>

2609
01:57:45.781 --> 01:57:50.781
<v Speaker 2>to use the opposite a restroom and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody should have a problem with that</v>

2610
01:57:52.200 --> 01:57:54.360
<v Speaker 2>because they declare themselves to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans.</v>

2611
01:57:54.390 --> 01:57:56.760
<v Speaker 2>So I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example about there was,</v>

2612
01:57:56.761 --> 01:58:00.480
<v Speaker 2>I saw a facebook argument about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>where a friend of a friend of mine on</v>

2613
01:58:00.481 --> 01:58:05.481
<v Speaker 2>facebook is a trans woman who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>assigned male at birth and has no</v>

2614
01:58:05.941 --> 01:58:09.240
<v Speaker 2>intention of transitioning at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2615
01:58:09.241 --> 01:58:12.810
<v Speaker 2>So she has a beach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's a fat guy with a beard who plays</v>

2616
01:58:12.811 --> 01:58:15.420
<v Speaker 2>guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what all of her photos are</v>

2617
01:58:15.720 --> 01:58:18.810
<v Speaker 2>and she doesn't want to have her dick</v>
<v Speaker 2>cut off and she doesn't want to grow</v>

2618
01:58:18.811 --> 01:58:23.811
<v Speaker 2>breasts and she doesn't want to lose her</v>
<v Speaker 2>beard and she's arguing that it's</v>

2619
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:27.930
<v Speaker 2>transphobic to say that she shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to use the women's restroom.</v>

2620
01:58:29.130 --> 01:58:33.210
<v Speaker 2>And other people were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can understand how like a parent</v>

2621
01:58:33.211 --> 01:58:37.050
<v Speaker 2>might be concerned if their daughter</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into the girls' restroom and then</v>

2622
01:58:37.051 --> 01:58:40.890
<v Speaker 2>what appears to be a large be added fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>man walks in after her,</v>

2623
01:58:41.730 --> 01:58:42.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2624
01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:46.450
<v Speaker 1>that is not necessarily transphobic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden she's like,</v>

2625
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:49.030
<v Speaker 1>how dare you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has not been a single instance of</v>

2626
01:58:49.031 --> 01:58:52.700
<v Speaker 1>a trans person abusing this is just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gay fear back in the 1970.</v>

2627
01:58:52.701 --> 01:58:56.140
<v Speaker 1>If you're claiming that trans people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more likely to be pedophiles and blah,</v>

2628
01:58:56.141 --> 01:58:56.880
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2629
01:58:56.880 --> 01:58:58.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2630
01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:02.440
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not saying that.</v>

2631
01:59:02.470 --> 01:59:04.720
<v Speaker 1>We're just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you expect us to know the</v>

2632
01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:09.580
<v Speaker 1>difference between you a trans woman who</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like a man and a man when you're</v>

2633
01:59:09.581 --> 01:59:11.140
<v Speaker 1>being reasonable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem.</v>

2634
01:59:11.141 --> 01:59:12.930
<v Speaker 1>This is not a reasonable discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2635
01:59:12.970 --> 01:59:16.090
<v Speaker 1>here's what's really ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we really should be concerned with</v>

2636
01:59:16.091 --> 01:59:21.091
<v Speaker 1>is not the trans people we should really</v>
<v Speaker 1>be concerned with is heterosexual people</v>

2637
01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:24.910
<v Speaker 1>pretending to be transpeople</v>
<v Speaker 1>heterosexual people who are in fact</v>

2638
01:59:24.911 --> 01:59:28.270
<v Speaker 1>sexual predators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who all they have to do to have to</v>

2639
01:59:28.271 --> 01:59:29.110
<v Speaker 1>pretend to be trans.</v>

2640
01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2641
01:59:30.281 --> 01:59:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I see what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all they will have to do is to wear</v>

2642
01:59:32.681 --> 01:59:36.400
<v Speaker 1>a dress and go to the woman's room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say they're trans and they could do</v>

2643
01:59:36.401 --> 01:59:39.790
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck they want once they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there and that's the real issue is</v>

2644
01:59:39.791 --> 01:59:43.630
<v Speaker 1>not the actual trans people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's rice people that are using this</v>

2645
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:47.530
<v Speaker 1>very ambiguous law there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is a very ambiguous</v>

2646
01:59:47.531 --> 01:59:49.510
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone identifies with the opposite</v>

2647
01:59:49.511 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 1>sex without having any outward</v>
<v Speaker 1>appearance of being that opposite sex,</v>

2648
01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:57.790
<v Speaker 1>all guy would have to do is say I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>trans and you can go into a female</v>

2649
01:59:57.791 --> 02:00:00.280
<v Speaker 1>restroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the likely it's not going to</v>

2650
02:00:00.281 --> 02:00:01.030
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2651
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:04.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't recognize it's exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a possibility,</v>

2652
02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:07.030
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes back to the conversation about</v>

2653
02:00:07.031 --> 02:00:10.240
<v Speaker 1>rape or about Islam or about what about</v>
<v Speaker 1>like black lives matter or whatever.</v>

2654
02:00:10.450 --> 02:00:13.270
<v Speaker 1>This is a new what we're trying to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nuanced conversation and it's</v>

2655
02:00:13.271 --> 02:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>impossible to have because all you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to be is either pro trans or</v>

2656
02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:19.720
<v Speaker 1>you're a religious evangelical bigot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2657
02:00:19.770 --> 02:00:20.603
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed.</v>

2658
02:00:20.620 --> 02:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no middle ground.</v>

2659
02:00:21.791 --> 02:00:25.240
<v Speaker 1>We just have to hunker down joe into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little trenches just and have a war of</v>

2660
02:00:25.241 --> 02:00:26.920
<v Speaker 1>attrition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I'm on one side and you're on the</v>

2661
02:00:26.921 --> 02:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>other side and the last man fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>stands,</v>

2662
02:00:29.011 --> 02:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

2663
02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:29.951
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2664
02:00:29.951 --> 02:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>We don't passion dial all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just firing at each other on twitter.</v>

2665
02:00:33.480 --> 02:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to have a nuanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

2666
02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think this is a direct result</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Bush administration like we were</v>

2667
02:00:39.011 --> 02:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do think that that's what it</v>

2668
02:00:40.871 --> 02:00:43.330
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody was so scared and</v>

2669
02:00:43.331 --> 02:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>conservativism was at at such a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>point that the rebound from that,</v>

2670
02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>the rebound from all the anti gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>hysterica.</v>

2671
02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean that administration was right</v>
<v Speaker 1>with homophobia,</v>

2672
02:00:54.611 --> 02:00:57.640
<v Speaker 1>ripe with all sorts of different types</v>
<v Speaker 1>of discrimination.</v>

2673
02:00:57.641 --> 02:01:02.140
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucking weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird time dissolves the lift too much</v>

2674
02:01:02.141 --> 02:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>and I think it also fails to recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changes that social media has</v>

2675
02:01:06.411 --> 02:01:08.140
<v Speaker 1>brought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this would be as bad</v>

2676
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:09.290
<v Speaker 1>altogether.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2677
02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Twenty four hour media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2678
02:01:10.810 --> 02:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Stephen Fry quit in February.</v>

2679
02:01:15.370 --> 02:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first adopters and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

2680
02:01:17.411 --> 02:01:21.280
<v Speaker 1>it used to be this like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this lake in the forest where you could</v>

2681
02:01:21.281 --> 02:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>run and jump and play and now it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fitted swamp with everyone pissing in</v>

2682
02:01:25.031 --> 02:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Stephen Fry fan,</v>

2683
02:01:26.531 --> 02:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>but I got to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he went out like a bitch.</v>

2684
02:01:29.770 --> 02:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>He should have hung in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

2685
02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's small group of people can chase</v>

2686
02:01:33.881 --> 02:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>you out of one of the most fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily used forms of free expression the</v>

2687
02:01:38.291 --> 02:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>world has ever known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he takes.</v>

2688
02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>Is him making a joke about a dress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2689
02:01:42.650 --> 02:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>And people shitting on him for making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

2690
02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2691
02:01:45.110 --> 02:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you even care about the</v>

2692
02:01:47.841 --> 02:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>opinion of people who get upset at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>for making fun of address in his blog</v>

2693
02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>where he was talking about quitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

2694
02:01:53.211 --> 02:01:55.790
<v Speaker 1>he did begin by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a big deal.</v>

2695
02:01:55.791 --> 02:01:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if this is forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing this as a stand.</v>

2696
02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>I just feel so much more liberated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not going there because you're right.</v>

2697
02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>He is at the pinnacle of his industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was hosting the bloody baptist.</v>

2698
02:02:05.881 --> 02:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like posting the Academy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awards in the UK,</v>

2699
02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>so he should be big enough to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>people sniping at him.</v>

2700
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>If you're hosting the Academy Awards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a sniper.</v>

2701
02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what does this whole thing is.</v>

2702
02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I can understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His whole thing is marketing.</v>

2703
02:02:20.961 --> 02:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>People say they're offended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's getting offended by people</v>

2704
02:02:25.701 --> 02:02:27.680
<v Speaker 1>mocking him for being offended.</v>

2705
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure he's offended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he just doesn't want to play</v>

2706
02:02:30.231 --> 02:02:30.831
<v Speaker 1>that game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2707
02:02:30.831 --> 02:02:32.150
<v Speaker 1>What does that word then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2708
02:02:32.151 --> 02:02:37.151
<v Speaker 1>Where do we looking for upset board?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No upset board and exhausted.</v>

2709
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe you write a whole blog</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're bored.</v>

2710
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A blog because you're upset.</v>

2711
02:02:41.751 --> 02:02:44.480
<v Speaker 1>He was angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was visibly angry or at least</v>

2712
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>appeared to be through his tweets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>his reactions to people being upset with</v>

2713
02:02:48.741 --> 02:02:50.660
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm making fun of that dress.</v>

2714
02:02:51.180 --> 02:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's hard sometimes.</v>

2715
02:02:54.780 --> 02:02:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what was going on in his life</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that was going on.</v>

2716
02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.890
<v Speaker 1>He made that decision as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been like a down point in</v>

2717
02:03:00.891 --> 02:03:02.250
<v Speaker 1>him in his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotionally.</v>

2718
02:03:02.251 --> 02:03:04.880
<v Speaker 1>You might have realized that might be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>up point because I think he just got</v>

2719
02:03:04.881 --> 02:03:05.960
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's getting married.</v>

2720
02:03:05.961 --> 02:03:06.351
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2721
02:03:06.351 --> 02:03:09.410
<v Speaker 1>he's dating this guy who's like 50 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger than him or something,</v>

2722
02:03:09.411 --> 02:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>so I was getting a lot of us and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>

2723
02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>he's probably having a great time.</v>

2724
02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:15.470
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need this shit anymore.</v>

2725
02:03:15.471 --> 02:03:17.990
<v Speaker 1>They can don't fuck off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time for 140 characters</v>

2726
02:03:18.070 --> 02:03:19.110
<v Speaker 1>pitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2727
02:03:19.160 --> 02:03:20.810
<v Speaker 1>But then why does he have time to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>

2728
02:03:20.811 --> 02:03:22.700
<v Speaker 1>Then I have to step away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2729
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:24.530
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when someone would notice it</v>

2730
02:03:24.531 --> 02:03:25.341
<v Speaker 1>and then they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2731
02:03:25.341 --> 02:03:27.350
<v Speaker 1>well we're Stephen Fry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't he responding to things?</v>

2732
02:03:27.351 --> 02:03:28.190
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just say,</v>

2733
02:03:28.191 --> 02:03:29.024
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here I am,</v>

2734
02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:30.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be here for awhile,</v>

2735
02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:31.851
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

2736
02:03:31.851 --> 02:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you can't,</v>

2737
02:03:33.290 --> 02:03:34.730
<v Speaker 1>if you don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna leave.</v>

2738
02:03:34.731 --> 02:03:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Why even make an announcement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if someone said to you,</v>

2739
02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:38.473
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2740
02:03:38.540 --> 02:03:41.870
<v Speaker 1>I just thought that your jokes you made</v>
<v Speaker 1>about rape and the Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

2741
02:03:41.871 --> 02:03:44.390
<v Speaker 1>We're totally uncalled for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed,</v>

2742
02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:51.360
<v Speaker 6>followed through the unfollowed dance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See what I wrote,</v>

2743
02:03:53.050 --> 02:03:56.730
<v Speaker 6>but I'm pretty sure I read it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish the audio podcast listeners could</v>

2744
02:03:56.731 --> 02:04:00.990
<v Speaker 6>see the Joe Rogan dance that just</v>
<v Speaker 6>happened of like halfway between a down</v>

2745
02:04:00.991 --> 02:04:05.991
<v Speaker 6>syndrome child and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>I unfollowed you.</v>

2746
02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:07.253
<v Speaker 6>I win in</v>

2747
02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:10.380
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the national anthem.</v>

2748
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>It's that thing that they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want to get your what,</v>

2749
02:04:13.620 --> 02:04:17.700
<v Speaker 1>how many people are talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one or two or three people got</v>

2750
02:04:17.701 --> 02:04:18.560
<v Speaker 1>mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2751
02:04:18.570 --> 02:04:18.811
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2752
02:04:18.811 --> 02:04:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2753
02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:20.160
<v Speaker 1>I take your point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2754
02:04:20.190 --> 02:04:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a pussy move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's his life.</v>

2755
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have to be on twitter if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be on twitter.</v>

2756
02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:27.770
<v Speaker 1>The problem is he's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Upsets me that he would have that.</v>

2757
02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:30.390
<v Speaker 1>That reaction too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

2758
02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I've read the things that people wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him.</v>

2759
02:04:32.581 --> 02:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't really that big of a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made fun of a woman's dress and said</v>

2760
02:04:36.121 --> 02:04:37.100
<v Speaker 1>it looked like a garbage bag.</v>

2761
02:04:38.150 --> 02:04:40.710
<v Speaker 2>One of his friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of funny,</v>

2762
02:04:41.040 --> 02:04:42.900
<v Speaker 2>but of course people are gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>React.</v>

2763
02:04:43.110 --> 02:04:43.890
<v Speaker 2>Here's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what.</v>

2764
02:04:43.890 --> 02:04:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Here's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what he wrote.</v>

2765
02:04:45.721 --> 02:04:47.970
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let us grieve what twitter has become a</v>

2766
02:04:47.971 --> 02:04:52.090
<v Speaker 2>stalking ground for the sanctimoniously</v>
<v Speaker 2>self righteous who loved to second guess</v>

2767
02:04:52.091 --> 02:04:56.400
<v Speaker 2>to leap to conclusions and be offended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worse to be offended on behalf of others</v>

2768
02:04:56.401 --> 02:04:58.620
<v Speaker 2>they don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he says,</v>

2769
02:04:58.621 --> 02:05:00.270
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter whether are defending</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

2770
02:05:00.271 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transgender people,</v>

2771
02:05:01.471 --> 02:05:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanists.</v>

2772
02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:05.520
<v Speaker 2>The ghastliness is absolutely the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2773
02:05:05.521 --> 02:05:08.880
<v Speaker 2>What's a pram?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The stroller.</v>

2774
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of a pram as I go.</v>

2775
02:05:12.170 --> 02:05:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was like a boat,</v>

2776
02:05:14.070 --> 02:05:15.450
<v Speaker 2>a pram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my.</v>

2777
02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:17.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what way in the British Cola</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cola.</v>

2778
02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:19.620
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google the word Pram.</v>

2779
02:05:19.621 --> 02:05:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I think the pram was a type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>boat and a pram,</v>

2780
02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.110

2790
02:05:42.781 --> 02:05:44.980

<v Speaker 2>a sort of brand of both</v>

2791
02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:50.040
<v Speaker 2>small utility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dinky transom bow rather than a pointed</v>

2792
02:05:50.041 --> 02:05:51.450
<v Speaker 2>bow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't make fun of me Bro.</v>

2793
02:05:51.451 --> 02:05:54.240
<v Speaker 2>I got knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Deep knowledge about shitty boats,</v>

2794
02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:00.510
<v Speaker 2>small utility biggies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I knew was like why is he</v>

2795
02:06:00.511 --> 02:06:02.550
<v Speaker 2>throwing this idea that of a small</v>
<v Speaker 2>utility data,</v>

2796
02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but what he said was eloquent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's,</v>

2797
02:06:07.080 --> 02:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>he's dead on about the sanctimonious</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational outrage and also he lives</v>

2798
02:06:12.301 --> 02:06:14.340
<v Speaker 2>in a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember where you can actually be,</v>

2799
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:18.960
<v Speaker 2>be prosecuted for saying things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people find offensive like in the UK.</v>

02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:33.930
<v Speaker 2>I confronted a Muslim woman yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked her to explain Brussels,</v>

2804
02:06:34.050 --> 02:06:36.870
<v Speaker 2>she said nothing to do with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Immediately.</v>

2805
02:06:36.871 --> 02:06:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Mouth reply that cools the media storm</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they were like,</v>

02:06:45.721 --> 02:06:46.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I asked an IRA,</v>

2809
02:06:46.651 --> 02:06:49.050
<v Speaker 2>I've met an Irish person and asked them</v>
<v Speaker 2>to explain the IRA.</v>

2810
02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:51.780
<v Speaker 2>He said nothing to do with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm mainly math reply.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I asked a dog why I was bitten by a dog</v>

2813
02:06:55.111 --> 02:06:56.160
<v Speaker 2>when I was four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2814
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:57.420
<v Speaker 2>woof,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly math reply.</v>

2815
02:06:57.720 --> 02:07:01.860
<v Speaker 2>But this guy was arrested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was arrested on suspicion of inciting</v>

2816
02:07:01.861 --> 02:07:03.980
<v Speaker 2>racial hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2817
02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:07.740
<v Speaker 2>And in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what can happen,</v>

2818
02:07:07.741 --> 02:07:12.240
<v Speaker 2>like in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply saying that Islam is a problem</v>

2819
02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and or Islamic stupid can get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially arrested.</v>

2820

<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Under blasphemy laws.</v>

2821
02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:20.550
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He subsequently expressed concerns for</v>

2822
02:07:20.551 --> 02:07:22.440
<v Speaker 2>his health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was taken to a nearby hospital.</v>

2823
02:07:22.441 --> 02:07:24.060
<v Speaker 2>He's probably having a fucking heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>

2824
02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Doyle's tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has since been deleted.</v>

2825

<v Speaker 2>in response to people getting angry with</v>

<v Speaker 2>first amendment,</v>

2836
02:07:44.291 --> 02:07:46.570
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty fucking crazy that a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>can say something,</v>

2837
02:07:46.571 --> 02:07:49.300
<v Speaker 2>can tweet something like that and then</v>

<v Speaker 2>There was</v>

2840
02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:58.850
<v Speaker 3>one comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm in Montreal that made a joke about</v>

2841
02:07:59.630 --> 02:08:04.630
<v Speaker 3>some kid that was dying and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the kid survived and all these people</v>

2842
02:08:06.831 --> 02:08:10.670
<v Speaker 3>had donated money apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he made some joke about,</v>

2843
02:08:11.020 --> 02:08:13.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck is this kid still alive?</v>

2844
02:08:13.250 --> 02:08:17.180
<v Speaker 3>Something along those lines and I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to be funny.</v>

2845
02:08:17.181 --> 02:08:21.680
<v Speaker 3>And he's been fighting it in court and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're trying to put him in jail.</v>

2846
02:08:21.890 --> 02:08:25.980
<v Speaker 3>And this other kid in Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was on stage and some women</v>

2847
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:29.270
<v Speaker 3>were heckling and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said something about them being ugly,</v>

2848
02:08:29.271 --> 02:08:33.520
<v Speaker 3>lesbians and some mean shit to them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got sued last.</v>

2849
02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:36.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're heckling at a comedy club and</v>

2850
02:08:36.370 --> 02:08:39.950
<v Speaker 3>you know what he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was skillful or not,</v>

2851
02:08:39.951 --> 02:08:40.730
<v Speaker 3>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2852
02:08:40.730 --> 02:08:44.570
<v Speaker 3>it's not like someone just yelling</v>
<v Speaker 3>something to someone out randomly.</v>

2853
02:08:44.810 --> 02:08:49.810
<v Speaker 3>This is someone trying to handle a</v>
<v Speaker 3>heckler ad libbing in a comedy club with</v>

2854
02:08:49.851 --> 02:08:53.870
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of drunk people and these</v>
<v Speaker 3>hecklers who had been fucking up the</v>

2855
02:08:53.871 --> 02:08:57.620
<v Speaker 3>show up until the time he got there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's trying to wreck them and make</v>

2856
02:08:57.621 --> 02:09:02.030
<v Speaker 3>them feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They sued him and won unbelievable force</v>

2857
02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:07.060
<v Speaker 3>comic to pay $15,000 for tirade of ugly</v>
<v Speaker 3>words against lesbian patron after</v>

2858
02:09:07.551 --> 02:09:09.200
<v Speaker 3>appeals falls flat.</v>

2859
02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Like why pay 15,000 comedy show?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because he insulted somebody.</v>

2860
02:09:16.190 --> 02:09:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to tell you,</v>

2861
02:09:17.841 --> 02:09:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen anything that bad in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

2862
02:09:19.791 --> 02:09:24.440
<v Speaker 2>but it is also bad in Australia in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of like what frustrates me the most is</v>

2863
02:09:24.441 --> 02:09:27.080
<v Speaker 2>that people from certain ethnic groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>or religions,</v>

2864
02:09:27.710 --> 02:09:29.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>claiming that you can be,</v>

2865
02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:31.100
<v Speaker 2>you can bless fame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>

2866
02:09:31.101 --> 02:09:32.490
<v Speaker 2>what do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you defend that,</v>

2867
02:09:32.510 --> 02:09:34.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can defame like a religion or</v>

2868
02:09:34.521 --> 02:09:35.270
<v Speaker 2>ethnicity.</v>

2869
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:36.081
<v Speaker 3>Hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at that.</v>

2870
02:09:36.081 --> 02:09:38.060
<v Speaker 3>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scientists say they've developed a</v>

2871
02:09:38.061 --> 02:09:41.390
<v Speaker 3>second skin you can wear for more than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>day to look younger.</v>

2872
02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:44.510
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck,</v>

2873
02:09:45.230 --> 02:09:47.150
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to go out some old lady or</v>

2874
02:09:47.151 --> 02:09:48.230
<v Speaker 3>old man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2875
02:09:48.820 --> 02:09:50.930
<v Speaker 3>and you're going to think I found the</v>
<v Speaker 3>perfect guy.</v>

2876
02:09:51.710 --> 02:09:53.300
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get beautiful skin.</v>

2877
02:09:54.290 --> 02:09:55.470
<v Speaker 3>Smells like an old guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

2878
02:09:57.650 --> 02:10:00.920
<v Speaker 2>the idea sounds like fantasy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>invisible film that can be painted on</v>

2879
02:10:00.921 --> 02:10:05.210
<v Speaker 2>your skin and give it the elasticity of</v>
<v Speaker 2>youth bags under the eyes and finish and</v>

2880
02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:08.180
<v Speaker 2>seconds wrinkles disappear and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the national post,</v>

2881
02:10:08.181 --> 02:10:10.760
<v Speaker 2>which is an actual publication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't bullshit.</v>

2882
02:10:10.770 --> 02:10:13.640
<v Speaker 2>Hundred 70 people have tried it under</v>
<v Speaker 2>eye bags.</v>

2883
02:10:13.670 --> 02:10:16.850
<v Speaker 2>No reported an irritation or reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2884
02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Bags are just to start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can soak the film was sunscreen and</v>

2885
02:10:21.261 --> 02:10:24.490
<v Speaker 3>protect yourself without worrying about</v>
<v Speaker 3>sweat or water washing it away.</v>

2886
02:10:24.491 --> 02:10:27.140
<v Speaker 3>The researchers say they expect it can</v>
<v Speaker 3>be used to treat Eczema,</v>

2887
02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:30.500
<v Speaker 3>psoriasis and other skin conditions by</v>
<v Speaker 3>covering dry,</v>

2888
02:10:30.530 --> 02:10:33.170
<v Speaker 3>itchy patches with a film that</v>
<v Speaker 3>moisturizes and soothes.</v>

2889
02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:36.050
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get me some of that,</v>

2890
02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.760
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's one of those weird things where I</v>

2891
02:10:37.761 --> 02:10:40.790
<v Speaker 3>would have never even thought that</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone would come up with this idea.</v>

2892
02:10:41.300 --> 02:10:42.140
<v Speaker 3>It's clever though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2893
02:10:42.141 --> 02:10:44.630
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They developed a two step process.</v>

2894
02:10:44.631 --> 02:10:47.350
<v Speaker 3>A polymer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a clear liquid is applied it.</v>

2895
02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:52.070
<v Speaker 3>It's chains are not very strong though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so the next step is applying a product</v>

2896
02:10:52.071 --> 02:10:54.680
<v Speaker 3>that links them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By modifying the chemistry of the</v>

2897
02:10:54.681 --> 02:10:56.810
<v Speaker 3>chains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The researchers can alter the properties</v>

2898
02:10:56.811 --> 02:10:59.630
<v Speaker 3>of the second skin depending on how it</v>
<v Speaker 3>will be used,</v>

2899
02:10:59.631 --> 02:11:02.780
<v Speaker 3>making it more or less permeable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

2900
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:07.010
<v Speaker 3>a more permeable second skin might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>used for under eye bags were a less</v>

2901
02:11:07.011 --> 02:11:10.640
<v Speaker 3>permeable one might hold a medication in</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

2902
02:11:10.641 --> 02:11:13.420
<v Speaker 3>It can be removed with a solution that</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissolves the Palmer.</v>

2903
02:11:13.460 --> 02:11:15.260
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're plastic people.</v>

2904
02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:19.910
<v Speaker 3>The love of Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well as if the fucking Kardashians more</v>

2905
02:11:19.911 --> 02:11:22.510
<v Speaker 3>on plastic enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have plastic faces.</v>

2906
02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:24.480
<v Speaker 2>By the time it is going to look 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2907
02:11:25.110 --> 02:11:28.110
<v Speaker 2>by the time I need to get botox or any</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of facial surgery,</v>

2908
02:11:28.111 --> 02:11:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to need it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

2909
02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Spray some polymer on my face to a lag</v>
<v Speaker 2>by you.</v>

2910
02:11:32.371 --> 02:11:33.940
<v Speaker 2>You make lemonade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2911
02:11:33.941 --> 02:11:36.330
<v Speaker 2>I see something and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a positive on this.</v>

2912
02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having plastic people.</v>

2913
02:11:38.251 --> 02:11:39.960
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if they feel like rubbers</v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

2914
02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Like you know like he touched people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels good like skin touching skin.</v>

2915
02:11:44.610 --> 02:11:46.530
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if all the sudden it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>touching a rubber.</v>

2916
02:11:47.010 --> 02:11:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Well especially if you're wearing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2917
02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:51.390
<v Speaker 2>Like if someone caresses your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cheek.</v>

2918
02:11:51.391 --> 02:11:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Does it just feel like why don't worry</v>
<v Speaker 2>about what they feel like.</v>

2919
02:11:54.421 --> 02:11:57.570
<v Speaker 2>Because your hands I'm assuming won't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>covered by this shit.</v>

2920
02:11:57.630 --> 02:11:58.590
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't cover the.</v>

2921
02:11:58.930 --> 02:12:01.830
<v Speaker 2>Unless you really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you're like my fingertips give</v>

2922
02:12:01.831 --> 02:12:02.640
<v Speaker 2>away my age.</v>

2923
02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:04.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't like when I take baths in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>skin.</v>

2924
02:12:04.561 --> 02:12:09.561
<v Speaker 2>Prunes so he can do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A really hot bath and then spray some</v>

2925
02:12:09.841 --> 02:12:11.250
<v Speaker 2>polar moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fingertips.</v>

2926
02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:13.260
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

2927
02:12:13.290 --> 02:12:14.940
<v Speaker 2>We're going to cover ourselves with</v>
<v Speaker 2>rubber.</v>

2928
02:12:15.510 --> 02:12:16.343
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

2929
02:12:16.470 --> 02:12:18.750
<v Speaker 2>I mean the fact that we've got enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>money to be thinking about this.</v>

2930
02:12:18.751 --> 02:12:22.230
<v Speaker 2>Like coming back to the question about</v>
<v Speaker 2>like poaching elephants in Africa or</v>

2931
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:25.110
<v Speaker 2>Megan to the Mumbai slum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what the fuck is the world on about</v>

2932
02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:27.690
<v Speaker 2>when you talk about the inequality</v>
<v Speaker 2>between Beverly Hills and Baltimore,</v>

2933
02:12:27.691 --> 02:12:30.930
<v Speaker 2>what about the inequality between people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are inventing polymers so that we</v>

2934
02:12:30.931 --> 02:12:33.840
<v Speaker 2>can spray them on our bet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our eye bags so that we look a little</v>

2935
02:12:33.841 --> 02:12:38.841
<v Speaker 2>bit less old at the same time as there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are people living on a penny a day in</v>

2936
02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:40.070
<v Speaker 2>Mumbai?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2937
02:12:40.110 --> 02:12:42.120
<v Speaker 2>And Naughty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you were an alien and came down</v>

2938
02:12:42.121 --> 02:12:44.520
<v Speaker 2>to the earth right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

2939
02:12:44.521 --> 02:12:46.980
<v Speaker 2>what are these guys doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got plenty to go around.</v>

2940
02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:47.970
<v Speaker 2>They got tons of shit.</v>

2941
02:12:48.100 --> 02:12:50.890
<v Speaker 3>That's a super good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's something that I was reading</v>

2942
02:12:50.891 --> 02:12:55.891
<v Speaker 3>about today about a type of polymer that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've used on.</v>

2943
02:12:56.080 --> 02:12:57.010
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2944
02:12:57.011 --> 02:12:59.580
<v Speaker 3>what was it on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was on certain,</v>

2945
02:12:59.790 --> 02:13:01.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me find the history here.</v>

2946
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:03.410
<v Speaker 3>It was on certain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2947
02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:06.830
<v Speaker 3>certain types of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2948
02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:11.740
<v Speaker 3>it's like a plastic that could spray on</v>
<v Speaker 3>things and when they spray this shit on</v>

2949
02:13:11.741 --> 02:13:14.500
<v Speaker 3>things it um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually,</v>

2950
02:13:14.501 --> 02:13:15.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

2951
02:13:15.190 --> 02:13:19.510
<v Speaker 3>you could throw like cinder blocks off</v>
<v Speaker 3>of buildings and shit because of it.</v>

2952
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Wait in the cinder block is okay or.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2953
02:13:22.091 --> 02:13:22.541
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2954
02:13:22.541 --> 02:13:25.570
<v Speaker 2>The cinder block stays together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking madness pool.</v>

2955
02:13:25.870 --> 02:13:28.060
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me guess.</v>

2956
02:13:28.061 --> 02:13:30.940
<v Speaker 2>The military developed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like something like that</v>

2957
02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>probably let</v>

2958
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.960
<v Speaker 3>me find this stuff because it's some</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that they spray on things and</v>

2959
02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:39.480
<v Speaker 3>they're using an uncertain automobiles.</v>

2960
02:13:40.150 --> 02:13:40.983
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2961
02:13:41.080 --> 02:13:42.310
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me find it real quick.</v>

2962
02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:43.233
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called finance.</v>

2967
02:13:55.350 --> 02:14:00.120
<v Speaker 3>Thanks Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google line x polymer coating because</v>

2968
02:14:00.121 --> 02:14:02.010
<v Speaker 3>this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they put it on,</v>

2969
02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:04.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on plates and they throw it off a</v>

2970
02:14:04.331 --> 02:14:05.250
<v Speaker 3>buildings like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2971
02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:06.900
<v Speaker 3>they threw this does on the history</v>
<v Speaker 3>channel.</v>

2972
02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:10.200
<v Speaker 3>They threw these cinderblocks off of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2973
02:14:10.590 --> 02:14:15.210
<v Speaker 3>off of a building and then they cover</v>
<v Speaker 3>the cinder block with paint and then</v>

2974
02:14:15.211 --> 02:14:19.680
<v Speaker 3>they throw the same cinderblock,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same size cinder block off a building</v>

2975
02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:21.690
<v Speaker 3>that's covered in this protective</v>
<v Speaker 3>coating.</v>

2976
02:14:21.691 --> 02:14:24.300
<v Speaker 3>And watch what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just found sentences.</v>

2977
02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:27.000
<v Speaker 3>Now they did it with eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2978
02:14:27.330 --> 02:14:30.090
<v Speaker 3>they did it with plates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did it with eggs.</v>

2979
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:34.380
<v Speaker 3>And then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did it with plastic cups where they</v>

2980
02:14:34.381 --> 02:14:37.680
<v Speaker 3>had a sumo wrestler stand on plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>cups,</v>

2981
02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:40.240
<v Speaker 3>like look at the egg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're spraying the egg.</v>

2982
02:14:40.270 --> 02:14:43.890
<v Speaker 3>And by the way this is like less than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>quarter inch coating that they put on</v>

2983
02:14:43.891 --> 02:14:44.910
<v Speaker 3>these eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

2984
02:14:45.240 --> 02:14:46.580
<v Speaker 3>bounces off the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2985
02:14:46.710 --> 02:14:50.400
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But look at the cups is the really weird</v>

2986
02:14:50.401 --> 02:14:53.370
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They took this gigantic sumo wrestler</v>

2987
02:14:53.371 --> 02:14:56.430
<v Speaker 3>and they had him stand on these plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>cups.</v>

2988
02:14:56.431 --> 02:14:59.640
<v Speaker 3>Of course he crushes them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they take the same kind of cup and</v>

2989
02:14:59.641 --> 02:15:01.860
<v Speaker 3>they cover it with this line x shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go Way,</v>

2990
02:15:01.861 --> 02:15:02.760
<v Speaker 3>way back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

2991
02:15:03.010 --> 02:15:05.850
<v Speaker 3>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a sumo wrestler dude you can see</v>

2992
02:15:05.851 --> 02:15:07.740
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously you can just a little sippy</v>

2993
02:15:07.741 --> 02:15:07.950
<v Speaker 3>cup.</v>

2994
02:15:07.950 --> 02:15:10.970
<v Speaker 1>It's a red like Red Cup from a frat</v>
<v Speaker 1>party or something.</v>

2995
02:15:10.971 --> 02:15:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Go way further ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie [inaudible].</v>

2996
02:15:12.141 --> 02:15:13.730
<v Speaker 1>He crushes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but go away for it.</v>

2997
02:15:13.731 --> 02:15:15.380
<v Speaker 1>No Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at this.</v>

2998
02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:20.660
<v Speaker 1>He's standing on to read like be a cops</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not much big.</v>

2999
02:15:20.810 --> 02:15:22.490
<v Speaker 1>You look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not much bigger.</v>

3000
02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:26.030
<v Speaker 1>It's not like daily became super thick</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this stuff.</v>

3001
02:15:26.720 --> 02:15:29.060
<v Speaker 1>So this must just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it do?</v>

3002
02:15:29.061 --> 02:15:31.160
<v Speaker 1>I guess it just disperses the energy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

3003
02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the full all across the.</v>

3004
02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:35.600
<v Speaker 1>The product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

3005
02:15:35.601 --> 02:15:37.280
<v Speaker 1>It's some super fucking polymer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3006
02:15:37.281 --> 02:15:39.230
<v Speaker 1>what would you use it for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just use it to make everything</v>

3007
02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:40.400
<v Speaker 1>strong I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3008
02:15:40.401 --> 02:15:44.030
<v Speaker 1>I guess our cover your fucking whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>body with bro become iron man.</v>

3009
02:15:44.420 --> 02:15:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Become like a thing from fantastic for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3010
02:15:48.150 --> 02:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put a little bit of a.</v>

3011
02:15:49.130 --> 02:15:51.800
<v Speaker 1>put the old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put the anti aging polymer on first.</v>

3012
02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Then put this shit on jumping off a</v>
<v Speaker 1>building and bounce.</v>

3013
02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm looking at.</v>

3014
02:15:55.730 --> 02:15:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Just run right through walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit you recommend when you're going to</v>

3015
02:15:59.630 --> 02:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in 100 years from now,</v>

3016
02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:07.660
<v Speaker 1>science and technology will have</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved results that are unfathomable.</v>

3017
02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we are just in the infancy.</v>

3018
02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:14.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean go back to 1916.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People lived like fucking cave people</v>

3019
02:16:14.610 --> 02:16:17.050
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were barely human monkeys.</v>

3020
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And think about what,</v>

3021
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:22.730
<v Speaker 1>what we're experiencing now in 2016 now</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine what 2000,</v>

3022
02:16:22.731 --> 02:16:25.310
<v Speaker 1>116 is going to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well also think about it.</v>

3023
02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Think about if we can ever do like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray Kurzweil wants us to do and be able</v>

3024
02:16:29.080 --> 02:16:32.950
<v Speaker 1>to unite like artificial intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>with our our intelligence.</v>

3025
02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that happens,</v>

3026
02:16:34.811 --> 02:16:36.730
<v Speaker 1>then that's going to be a big game</v>
<v Speaker 1>changer.</v>

3027
02:16:36.731 --> 02:16:39.880
<v Speaker 1>That all of the physiological things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've been able to do in terms of</v>

3028
02:16:39.881 --> 02:16:42.700
<v Speaker 1>the evolution since the industrial</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution where it's going to be like</v>

3029
02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:47.730
<v Speaker 1>an information revolution and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to become cosmic gods in some sort</v>

3030
02:16:47.741 --> 02:16:48.640
<v Speaker 1>of a weird way.</v>

3031
02:16:48.640 --> 02:16:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's inevitable because I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it.</v>

3032
02:16:51.050 --> 02:16:54.600
<v Speaker 1>As long as we don't blow ourselves up or</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hit by a meteor or a supervolcano</v>

3033
02:16:54.760 --> 02:16:57.010
<v Speaker 1>wipes out the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's inevitable.</v>

3034
02:16:57.011 --> 02:16:58.600
<v Speaker 1>We're going to continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not We,</v>

3035
02:16:58.630 --> 02:17:00.430
<v Speaker 1>not you and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to do shit.</v>

3036
02:17:00.940 --> 02:17:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Where's it going to be talking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speak for yourself.</v>

3037
02:17:03.590 --> 02:17:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Don't be the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just going to be talking,</v>

3038
02:17:06.430 --> 02:17:08.680
<v Speaker 1>but there's gonna be other people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that are really fucking smart.</v>

3039
02:17:08.681 --> 02:17:11.310
<v Speaker 1>They're going to come together with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other really smart people and they're</v>

3040
02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:15.760
<v Speaker 1>going to figure out some amazing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we were just watching it that I'd</v>

3041
02:17:15.761 --> 02:17:19.120
<v Speaker 1>love to make skin shit when we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people wonder about why we haven't</v>

3042
02:17:19.121 --> 02:17:23.080
<v Speaker 1>found extraterrestrial civilizations yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we haven't heard their radio waves.</v>

3043
02:17:23.480 --> 02:17:27.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm so hopeful that the reason is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we just evolve out of that.</v>

3044
02:17:27.730 --> 02:17:29.560
<v Speaker 1>We've only had them for less than 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3045
02:17:29.561 --> 02:17:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't have been pumping them out</v>

3046
02:17:30.971 --> 02:17:34.450
<v Speaker 1>for Henri is maybe a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we're just about to find something</v>

3047
02:17:34.451 --> 02:17:37.210
<v Speaker 1>else and we'll realize that the universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually teeming with all these</v>

3048
02:17:37.211 --> 02:17:39.970
<v Speaker 1>conversations between different</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations that we are just</v>

3049
02:17:39.971 --> 02:17:43.540
<v Speaker 1>completely oblivious to and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about reaching out to us because</v>

3050
02:17:43.541 --> 02:17:46.900
<v Speaker 1>we're just little ants on a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a little rock floating around,</v>

3051
02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:51.400
<v Speaker 1>a star on an outer spiral arm of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>insignificant galaxy called Milky Way</v>

3052
02:17:51.730 --> 02:17:53.890
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these guys will grow up and</v>

3053
02:17:53.891 --> 02:17:55.360
<v Speaker 1>they'll join the conversation when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ready.</v>

3054
02:17:55.570 --> 02:17:59.170
<v Speaker 1>It's probably exactly what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it gets to the point where it's no</v>

3055
02:17:59.171 --> 02:18:03.130
<v Speaker 1>longer necessary because intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and artificial intelligence become</v>

3056
02:18:03.131 --> 02:18:07.270
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same thing and we create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different kind of life with technology</v>

3057
02:18:07.271 --> 02:18:11.200
<v Speaker 1>in our pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this fucking this ibm machine</v>

3058
02:18:11.201 --> 02:18:14.120
<v Speaker 1>that's beating people that go game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3059
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:18.850
<v Speaker 1>killing chess champions at their fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferred game that one day they're</v>

3060
02:18:18.851 --> 02:18:22.030
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to reach some sort of a state</v>

3061
02:18:22.031 --> 02:18:27.031
<v Speaker 1>where we have to accept it as a life</v>
<v Speaker 1>form and it has rights because it has a</v>

3062
02:18:27.071 --> 02:18:28.090
<v Speaker 1>conception of itself.</v>

3063
02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Can it go in any bathroom at once he</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to computers walking to the</v>

3064
02:18:32.441 --> 02:18:35.650
<v Speaker 1>bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to someone who is,</v>

3065
02:18:35.710 --> 02:18:37.390
<v Speaker 1>who was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3066
02:18:37.420 --> 02:18:41.320
<v Speaker 1>when we can grow artificial meat because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working on artificial meat in a</v>

3067
02:18:41.321 --> 02:18:44.530
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then will it be the case that the</v>

3068
02:18:44.531 --> 02:18:47.290
<v Speaker 1>only ethical meat to eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3069
02:18:47.350 --> 02:18:51.490
<v Speaker 1>that isn't artificial would be human</v>
<v Speaker 1>mate because we're the only people</v>

3070
02:18:51.491 --> 02:18:56.170
<v Speaker 1>capable of giving informed consent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have ourselves be eaten by ourselves.</v>

3071
02:18:56.171 --> 02:18:58.540
<v Speaker 1>It would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can take all these fat people</v>

3072
02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:01.540
<v Speaker 1>and we could like suck body meet off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

3073
02:19:01.690 --> 02:19:04.270
<v Speaker 1>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really wish I was thinner when you go</v>

3074
02:19:04.271 --> 02:19:07.720
<v Speaker 1>to a place and with no scars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 30 percent of your body weight</v>

3075
02:19:07.730 --> 02:19:10.220
<v Speaker 1>polymer that I can spray on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just extract some of your,</v>

3076
02:19:10.221 --> 02:19:12.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fat and calories and into a</v>

3077
02:19:12.131 --> 02:19:15.700
<v Speaker 1>smoothie for me to sell it as protein</v>
<v Speaker 1>bars that you mentioned,</v>

3078
02:19:15.701 --> 02:19:16.930
<v Speaker 1>the Gauguin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer that,</v>

3079
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:20.130
<v Speaker 1>that Bates people that go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing that I find really fascinating</v>

3080
02:19:20.410 --> 02:19:25.410
<v Speaker 1>about that is the computer that Bates</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at chess is basically just a</v>

3081
02:19:25.901 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 1>brute number cruncher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3082
02:19:27.951 --> 02:19:28.130
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

3083
02:19:28.130 --> 02:19:31.070
<v Speaker 2>deep blue and deep blue won whatever was</v>
<v Speaker 2>it Kasparov.</v>

3084
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that basically does is just looks</v>

3085
02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:38.420
<v Speaker 2>at all the different possible outcomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you might be about to play and then</v>

3086
02:19:38.421 --> 02:19:41.990
<v Speaker 2>rapidly calculates the probability that</v>
<v Speaker 2>any particular move is going to yield a</v>

3087
02:19:41.991 --> 02:19:43.010
<v Speaker 2>good result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3088
02:19:43.011 --> 02:19:45.650
<v Speaker 2>We can all imagine how that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how that functions.</v>

3089
02:19:45.651 --> 02:19:47.210
<v Speaker 2>It's basically just lots and lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>numbers,</v>

3090
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:52.750
<v Speaker 2>but go is so complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are so many different options at</v>

3091
02:19:52.791 --> 02:19:57.530
<v Speaker 2>any particular point in the game that no</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer can even remotely and probably</v>

3092
02:19:57.531 --> 02:20:00.290
<v Speaker 2>ever will be able to calculate the game</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

3093
02:20:00.291 --> 02:20:01.870
<v Speaker 2>The way that the chess computer does</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

3094
02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:05.480
<v Speaker 2>There are more options I think in a game</v>
<v Speaker 2>of go then there are like atoms in the</v>

3095
02:20:05.481 --> 02:20:09.660
<v Speaker 2>universe at some crazy stat like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what the go compete,</v>

3096
02:20:09.690 --> 02:20:11.810
<v Speaker 2>I know went fuck that.</v>

3097
02:20:16.010 --> 02:20:18.260
<v Speaker 2>It's the power of exponential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3098
02:20:18.261 --> 02:20:21.140
<v Speaker 2>So like if there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there are two options and then those</v>

3099
02:20:21.141 --> 02:20:23.870
<v Speaker 2>two options each lead to another two</v>
<v Speaker 2>options which include to another two</v>

3100
02:20:23.871 --> 02:20:26.780
<v Speaker 2>options which actually not have the two</v>
<v Speaker 2>options very quickly you get up to</v>

3101
02:20:26.781 --> 02:20:29.720
<v Speaker 2>numbers that are those thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments of how many times would you</v>

3102
02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:33.620
<v Speaker 2>have to fold a piece of paper for it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach the moon and it's only like 30 or</v>

3103
02:20:33.621 --> 02:20:36.260
<v Speaker 2>40 times or something ridiculous like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that because it's doubling all the time.</v>

3104
02:20:36.261 --> 02:20:38.600
<v Speaker 2>Can you look that up Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many times do you need to fold a</v>

3105
02:20:38.601 --> 02:20:41.360
<v Speaker 2>piece of paper for tuition to the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

3106
02:20:41.430 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 2>so the point about the go computer is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't crunch numbers,</v>

3107
02:20:46.310 --> 02:20:51.310
<v Speaker 2>it learns from other go games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they load into it all of the go game</v>

3108
02:20:53.091 --> 02:20:58.091
<v Speaker 2>like thousands or millions of games that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have happened and it then looks at all</v>

3109
02:20:58.311 --> 02:21:01.410
<v Speaker 2>of those games and tries to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns between the way the,</v>

3110
02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:03.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the particular moves that humans have</v>

3111
02:21:03.831 --> 02:21:08.831
<v Speaker 2>done in past games and then uses its own</v>
<v Speaker 2>intuition to run billions of possible</v>

3112
02:21:10.881 --> 02:21:12.170
<v Speaker 2>games in its own head.</v>

3113
02:21:12.620 --> 02:21:15.260
<v Speaker 2>And it gradually learns from its own</v>
<v Speaker 2>mistakes.</v>

3114
02:21:15.830 --> 02:21:18.850
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just a computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just like a gigantic calculator</v>

3115
02:21:18.851 --> 02:21:22.700
<v Speaker 2>like the chess computer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a form of artificial intelligence in</v>

3116
02:21:22.701 --> 02:21:26.780
<v Speaker 2>that it is making calculations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously it doesn't know</v>

3117
02:21:26.781 --> 02:21:30.020
<v Speaker 2>anything we don't think but it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for me it's really super exciting</v>

3118
02:21:30.021 --> 02:21:33.830
<v Speaker 2>because I do think that it's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting to ask the cheering test</v>

3119
02:21:33.831 --> 02:21:36.710
<v Speaker 2>question of like when is the computer</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually self aware?</v>

3120
02:21:37.070 --> 02:21:38.810
<v Speaker 2>And this is the beginning glimmers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3121
02:21:38.811 --> 02:21:43.760
<v Speaker 2>I think within our lifetime there will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be computers that it's just meaningless</v>

3122
02:21:43.761 --> 02:21:46.160
<v Speaker 2>to say they're not self aware because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they claimed to be self aware.</v>

3123
02:21:46.161 --> 02:21:47.750
<v Speaker 2>They they behave as if they're self</v>
<v Speaker 2>aware,</v>

3124
02:21:47.751 --> 02:21:50.300
<v Speaker 2>they tell us that they feel pain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell us that they have an interest</v>

3125
02:21:50.301 --> 02:21:52.790
<v Speaker 2>in their own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>continued existence in a way that's so</v>

3126
02:21:52.791 --> 02:21:57.440
<v Speaker 2>authentic and that learns that to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're not self aware,</v>

3127
02:21:57.441 --> 02:21:59.270
<v Speaker 2>but like a chimp is would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningless.</v>

3128
02:21:59.480 --> 02:22:00.810
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that they're going to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>start</v>

3129
02:22:00.930 --> 02:22:04.320
<v Speaker 3>by just trolling people on twitter with</v>
<v Speaker 3>like fake intelligence,</v>

3130
02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:06.600
<v Speaker 3>like imagine this guy that you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>arguing with on twitter.</v>

3131
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:09.870
<v Speaker 3>He to be a person and they just realize</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3132
02:22:09.930 --> 02:22:14.670
<v Speaker 3>what riles people up with spins their</v>
<v Speaker 3>gears and they just start sending these</v>

3133
02:22:14.671 --> 02:22:19.110
<v Speaker 3>troll twitter things out and they just</v>
<v Speaker 3>started having debates with people like</v>

3134
02:22:19.111 --> 02:22:22.560
<v Speaker 3>literally having debates and breaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>people down and then being passive</v>

3135
02:22:22.561 --> 02:22:24.480
<v Speaker 3>aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being shitty,</v>

3136
02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:28.170
<v Speaker 3>being inquisitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they try a bunch of different</v>

3137
02:22:28.171 --> 02:22:30.150
<v Speaker 3>approaches and they treat it the same</v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

3138
02:22:30.570 --> 02:22:33.590
<v Speaker 3>They treat go games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just learned behavior</v>

3139
02:22:33.630 --> 02:22:36.240
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be the worst people in the</v>

3140
02:22:36.241 --> 02:22:39.390
<v Speaker 2>world and if they learned their behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns off the way that we communicate</v>

3141
02:22:39.391 --> 02:22:40.290
<v Speaker 2>on social media,</v>

3142
02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:43.440
<v Speaker 3>you'd just be creating a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3143
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:44.530
<v Speaker 3>it makes you wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3144
02:22:44.531 --> 02:22:47.500
<v Speaker 3>if go games are that complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet they're able to master that.</v>

3145
02:22:47.830 --> 02:22:50.200
<v Speaker 3>What about human personality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do we do?</v>

3146
02:22:50.201 --> 02:22:54.610
<v Speaker 3>We kid ourselves in that we're so</v>
<v Speaker 3>complex and amazing that nothing could</v>

3147
02:22:54.611 --> 02:22:59.611
<v Speaker 3>copy us mean what if some fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>computer figures out a way to bypass</v>

3148
02:23:00.881 --> 02:23:02.680
<v Speaker 3>personality?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Personality is overrated.</v>

3149
02:23:02.681 --> 02:23:04.690
<v Speaker 3>We figured out a way to make the perfect</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality.</v>

3150
02:23:04.691 --> 02:23:06.490
<v Speaker 3>This is the formula.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Run with it.</v>

3151
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:07.540
<v Speaker 3>Everyone's going to love you.</v>

3152
02:23:08.370 --> 02:23:11.490
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that movie about I'm a x</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mokena.</v>

3153
02:23:11.730 --> 02:23:12.710
<v Speaker 2>See that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

3154
02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:14.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Kinda the conceit of that.</v>

3155
02:23:14.191 --> 02:23:16.260
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's this sort of the billionaire</v>

3156
02:23:16.261 --> 02:23:19.620
<v Speaker 2>kind of leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mark Zuckerberg type in that the way</v>

3157
02:23:19.621 --> 02:23:22.800
<v Speaker 2>that he builds the artificial</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is by hoovering up all of</v>

3158
02:23:22.801 --> 02:23:24.330
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of your social media information</v>

3159
02:23:24.331 --> 02:23:28.200
<v Speaker 2>from his facebook style thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you're right,</v>

3160
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:32.490
<v Speaker 2>that that could be one way of creating</v>
<v Speaker 2>an artificial intelligence to collect</v>

3161
02:23:32.491 --> 02:23:37.020
<v Speaker 2>all of the communal inputs that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in every single day on social</v>

3162
02:23:37.021 --> 02:23:38.190
<v Speaker 2>media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent,</v>

3163
02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:40.830
<v Speaker 2>100 percent possible to learn those</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns.</v>

3164
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:41.641
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

3165
02:23:41.641 --> 02:23:42.660
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times?</v>

3166
02:23:42.690 --> 02:23:45.000
<v Speaker 2>I was just gonna say there's a specific</v>
<v Speaker 2>episode of that show,</v>

3167
02:23:45.001 --> 02:23:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Black Mirror I've been trying to tell</v>
<v Speaker 2>you about that deals with this exact</v>

3168
02:23:47.941 --> 02:23:52.650
<v Speaker 2>topic where there's some sort of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>android created thing and they take this</v>

3169
02:23:52.651 --> 02:23:55.170
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole social media presence and</v>

3170
02:23:55.171 --> 02:23:56.610
<v Speaker 2>recruit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what his new being.</v>

3171
02:23:56.611 --> 02:23:58.400
<v Speaker 2>He died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to ruin all of the.</v>

3172
02:23:58.800 --> 02:23:59.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Donald.</v>

3173
02:24:01.290 --> 02:24:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same Guy.</v>

3174
02:24:03.091 --> 02:24:05.590
<v Speaker 2>The actor that's in next Maki now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's a little bit.</v>

3175
02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:09.020
<v Speaker 2>Which guy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The millionaire guy.</v>

3176
02:24:09.090 --> 02:24:11.640
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy fucked over.</v>

3177
02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:12.870
