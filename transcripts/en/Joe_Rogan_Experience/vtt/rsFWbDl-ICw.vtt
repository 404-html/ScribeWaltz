<v Speaker 1>The three of us together would be the </v>

12
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:37.150
<v Speaker 1>greatest podcast cause I could interpret</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and you would be,</v>

13
00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.753
<v Speaker 1>it would be a real mma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could really talk to them about </v>

15
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>under hooks and to Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a fantastic,</v>

16
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.383
<v Speaker 1>the Cuban where they shipped them cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>they ship you off when you were a young </v>

17
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

18
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:52.270
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>they look at you on that ain't go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>I looked at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a choice.</v>

21
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>They look at you and they go do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

22
00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try that on.</v>

23
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

24
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.563
<v Speaker 1>Then they'd take her to a certain age </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that or the 80 to send you to </v>

25
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua or Russia.</v>

26
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>You train and that's why a lot of Cubans</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you docus because they'd go to rush</v>

27
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 1>and learn judo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

28
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So he's going to tell you how they </v>
<v Speaker 1>shipped him off and they don't just tell</v>

29
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>your mom like would take him tomorrow.</v>

30
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.713
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been interesting to me </v>

31
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:25.374
<v Speaker 2>because the Cubans and the Russians in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular were always thought of as </v>

32
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 2>being very technical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

33
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 2>The Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians are super technical.</v>

34
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.073
<v Speaker 2>That was what a lot of people attributed</v>
<v Speaker 2>George Saint Pierre Success in </v>

35
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 2>wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

36
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.300
<v Speaker 2>George didn't wrestle in college or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>high school,</v>

37
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.363
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he trained with a bunch of Russian </v>

38
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:42.324
<v Speaker 2>nationals and Montreal and apparently </v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal wrestlers and they have this </v>

39
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 2>incredible wrestling program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you see,</v>

40
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.290
<v Speaker 2>when you see Norma met off the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>mauls people inside the octagon,</v>

41
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.720
<v Speaker 2>like what in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that is like a,</v>

42
00:01:54.721 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 2>a perfect example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like style of super hard,</v>

43
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 2>super technical wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so good at it.</v>

44
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 2>There's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see,</v>

45
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.023
<v Speaker 2>you know what you see Loma Chanko used </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a wrestler is a video of La Loma </v>

46
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Chanko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he's doing sambo.</v>

47
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.853
<v Speaker 2>It looks like he's got a like a gian and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's him and some other cat and he's </v>

48
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 2>like 11 years old or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

49
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 2>So his father put him in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His father made him.</v>

50
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 2>Do you know Loma Chanko is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

51
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the best boxers ever.</v>

52
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.653
<v Speaker 2>Like literally one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>technically beautiful to watch boxers </v>

53
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 2>it's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this guy,</v>

54
00:02:29.311 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 2>he used to wrestle too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is this is a,</v>

55
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

56
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 2>It does him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

57
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 2>Is this him wrestling with somebody?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

58
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 2>this is one now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or he can still do this shit.</v>

59
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.743
<v Speaker 2>This is like pretty recent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he showed some of his wrestling </v>

60
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:45.384
<v Speaker 2>moves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other one was him when he was a </v>

61
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 2>little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's really tactical man.</v>

62
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 2>He knows how to wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is legit.</v>

63
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 2>Like when you see the way he's moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>his body,</v>

64
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 2>he's not faking that.</v>

65
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 2>He's done that a bunch of times and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

66
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one when he's a little kid,</v>

67
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

68
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.310
<v Speaker 2>It says Greco Roman wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're wearing a geek,</v>

69
00:03:04.311 --> 00:03:05.144
<v Speaker 2>so I'm not exactly sure what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he gets his kid and a gets behind </v>

70
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 2>them and send them for a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was,</v>

71
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 2>he's always been an amazing athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an area.</v>

72
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to that.</v>

73
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 2>There's something to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father had an idea to crazy ideas.</v>

74
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:22.714
<v Speaker 2>His father took him out of boxing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>put them in a dance for like several </v>

75
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.213
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

76
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 2>Ukrainian traditional dance style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they were talking about it on</v>

77
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 2>one of those hbo shows for like four </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

78
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the hbo show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for four years,</v>

79
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 2>I think he just danced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You imagined that his father's like,</v>

80
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:40.354
<v Speaker 2>you want to learn how to box,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to dance and now nobody's got </v>

81
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>footwork.</v>

82
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.240
<v Speaker 2>If you've seen him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>

83
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>you've seen like his highlight reel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

84
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

85
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.711
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up.</v>

86
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:51.544
<v Speaker 2>A woman will highlight reel because my </v>
<v Speaker 2>daughter goes to ballet and 80% of the </v>

87
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 2>clashes Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was thinking about it.</v>

88
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was watching the movements,</v>

89
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 2>the last parade movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

90
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:03.844
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people did ballet and I was thinking </v>

91
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 2>the GSP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know me,</v>

92
00:04:08.861 --> 00:04:13.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm like pre probably fucking does </v>
<v Speaker 2>ballet give them any wood bats would be,</v>

93
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.360
<v Speaker 2>it's great footwork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy is the wizard or footwork.</v>

94
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy because he was like right in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of you,</v>

95
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 2>but he's one step ahead of you at every </v>
<v Speaker 2>turn.</v>

96
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 2>Like he knows what you're going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

97
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:26.374
<v Speaker 2>While you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's moving in a way that you can't </v>

98
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in front of you and then he's not.</v>

99
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.193
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's the one of the most technical </v>

100
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:35.404
<v Speaker 2>boxers I've ever seen and it just an </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing stylistic achievement like what </v>

101
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 2>he can do with his body.</v>

102
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 2>His style is totally unique.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean every,</v>

103
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of guys have done it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys that moved in and out.</v>

104
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:49.324
<v Speaker 2>A lot of guys have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's doing it and it's such a high </v>

105
00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:52.714
<v Speaker 2>level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a high level that it makes people </v>

106
00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>confused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys quit in their corner that like what</v>

107
00:04:57.011 --> 00:04:57.844
<v Speaker 2>in the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I really think a lot of it probably </v>

108
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:00.784
<v Speaker 2>had to do with his father's cross </v>
<v Speaker 2>training and it particularly with the </v>

109
00:05:03.551 --> 00:05:04.384
<v Speaker 2>dance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean think about how effortlessly he </v>

110
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 2>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like steps around guys.</v>

111
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's got some incredible control </v>
<v Speaker 2>of his feet,</v>

112
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:14.464
<v Speaker 2>but it makes sense that like you would </v>
<v Speaker 2>learn how to move your feet in a </v>

113
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:17.674
<v Speaker 2>specific way that weren't the way you </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't learned how to move your hands </v>

114
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>in a specific way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

115
00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Like think about a guy like floyd </v>
<v Speaker 2>mayweather,</v>

116
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:24.124
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

117
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 2>His hand combinations with his upper </v>
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

118
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.790
<v Speaker 2>There are so precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like that,</v>

119
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:28.210
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

120
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.100
<v Speaker 2>that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with his legs,</v>

121
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>is he as precise as he asked?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Precise moving with his legs,</v>

122
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his with his hands or his,</v>

123
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:34.984
<v Speaker 2>the 60% or 70% or 80% lama chanko is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably po perfectly proportioned for </v>

124
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:45.910
<v Speaker 2>his style with his ability to move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also also his ability to box and hit</v>

125
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:46.744
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

126
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 2>he's got both things going on at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same time with next level angles.</v>

127
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.020
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

128
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 2>When you're younger in Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they picked you.</v>

129
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you</v>

130
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 3>wake up and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be a wrestling.</v>

<v Speaker 3>go wrestle.</v>

133
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.633
<v Speaker 3>And like what I was hearing back from </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in the early seventies it was like </v>

134
00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 3>they just took you away from your family</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and that was part of your training.</v>

<v Speaker 3>then they put you in there.</v>

140
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.943
<v Speaker 3>I already have graphics on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I figured that I put them up and </v>

141
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Speaker 3>we'll do a podcast in Spanish with </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking subtitles.</v>

142
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 3>Like an English film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

143
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 3>like a Giulini movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever one of those movies.</v>

144
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 3>People think that unique.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

145
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:38.413

<v Speaker 3>his English is too rough for me and I </v>

146
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 3>know what he's trying to say and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>frustration in his face.</v>

147
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.643
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] being so now he did a tape </v>

148
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:53.190
<v Speaker 3>the other day of him in Cuba waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biz,</v>

149
00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:56.810
<v Speaker 3>being in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Went to Cuba.</v>

<v Speaker 3>See if he's fine,</v>

151

<v Speaker 3>He's nuts.</v>

153
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 3>He's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fighting rockhold now,</v>

154
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 3>which is a tremendous ride on the test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

155
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.460
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy fairing.</v>

156
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 3>Good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very good fight.</v>

157
00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 3>Rockhold when he's on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's super dangerous.</v>

158
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.960
<v Speaker 3>You know when the rockhold made one slip</v>
<v Speaker 3>up against Bisping,</v>

159
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.070
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fair play to Biz,</v>

160
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:22.840
<v Speaker 3>Bang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

161
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 3>he came into that fight regardless of </v>
<v Speaker 3>where anybody ranked him,</v>

162
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:27.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like how,</v>

163
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.220
<v Speaker 3>how they felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His chances were he came in swinging.</v>

164
00:07:30.221 --> 00:07:32.740
<v Speaker 3>He has like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he had like 11 days notice,</v>

165
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was,</v>

166
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.203
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many days notice that Michael </v>

167
00:07:36.141 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 3>bisbing get when he fought Luke </v>
<v Speaker 3>rockhold?</v>

168
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was something crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>low.</v>

169
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.810
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't much time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

170
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.920
<v Speaker 3>route clock.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Luke rockhold is very,</v>

171
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a beach.</v>

172
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good.</v>

173
00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 3>His top game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me tell you something.</v>

174
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:51.760
<v Speaker 3>I think when he fought Michael Bisman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to lie to you.</v>

175
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.890
<v Speaker 3>I think his focus was a little off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe two in a way.</v>

176
00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 3>I think he was dating rockstars and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out in Hollywood.</v>

177
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.510
<v Speaker 3>I think he's not dating or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

178
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.160
<v Speaker 3>Now he's just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought when he beat a branch,</v>

179
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.560
<v Speaker 3>he looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But his Jujitsu is great.</v>

180
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.350
<v Speaker 3>He has great cakes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's great with his hands,</v>

181
00:08:09.351 --> 00:08:11.240
<v Speaker 3>his movement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>him against your,</v>

182
00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:12.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be interesting.</v>

183
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:14.390
<v Speaker 3>Let's skip vicious kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

184
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's four and he's won,</v>

185
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:20.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So Luke Rock robot is number one and one</v>

186
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 3>of the five I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this Joel [inaudible] is a four.</v>

187
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a great fight.</v>

188
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 3>And then you got jocker raised back in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mix.</v>

189
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.620
<v Speaker 3>You know what's crazy like I always say </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you like,</v>

190
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.523
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean to pronounce his name </v>

191
00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:36.050
<v Speaker 3>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then some guy out,</v>

192
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:36.884
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when he fought steel picking Dano </v>

193
00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 3>whom God on when he fought my man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Immigrant mentality.</v>

194
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:43.370
<v Speaker 3>Like a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

195
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:45.230
<v Speaker 3>he hits hard and all that stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

196
00:08:45.231 --> 00:08:48.020
<v Speaker 3>But now that dude still going to be more</v>
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>

197
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 3>Now he's going to fucking take that </v>
<v Speaker 3>loss.</v>

198
00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.170
<v Speaker 3>Batman man fucking machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to think how crazy it is that he</v>

199
00:08:54.171 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 3>went from a guy who</v>

200
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 4>was homeless too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five years later fighting for the </v>

201
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight title.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like a total amount of training,</v>

202
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.280
<v Speaker 4>five years of elementary training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting for the heavyweight title,</v>

203
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:09.740
<v Speaker 4>and he's the favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the favorite over geyser.</v>

204
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 4>He defended it twice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

205
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:14.490
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how talented he is.</v>

206
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 4>That's how terrifying is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how special he is.</v>

207
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:22.200
<v Speaker 4>But Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a loss like that to a guide like that,</v>

208
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.150
<v Speaker 4>like to a real champ like Steve Bay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if that,</v>

209
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 4>what's you realize where the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>game is?</v>

210
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 4>There's another,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a few more things to learn.</v>

211
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.160
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot more days to get in and </v>
<v Speaker 4>training,</v>

212
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.090
<v Speaker 4>but that guy has just begun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just began five years ago.</v>

213
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:36.924
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's way better now than he was two </v>

214
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 4>fights ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

215
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:41.034
<v Speaker 4>I see the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see the difference in the way he </v>

216
00:09:42.091 --> 00:09:44.130
<v Speaker 4>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When he fought overeem,</v>

217
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.083
<v Speaker 4>it was since significantly different </v>
<v Speaker 4>than when I saw him in his first and </v>

218
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 4>second fights is first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>second fights.</v>

219
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.200
<v Speaker 4>He was very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very,</v>

220
00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:52.034
<v Speaker 4>but just insanely strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would hit guys with these </v>

221
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.330
<v Speaker 4>combinations and clean technique to </v>
<v Speaker 4>matt.</v>

222
00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not just a physically strong guy.</v>

223
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 4>He's also very smart because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>learning to do everything mechanically.</v>

224
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:06.414
<v Speaker 4>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like a guy who's only been </v>

225
00:10:08.491 --> 00:10:12.720
<v Speaker 4>striking for like three or four years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they look a little tight and weird,</v>

226
00:10:12.721 --> 00:10:13.890
<v Speaker 4>but they can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if they land,</v>

227
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 4>they've got a lot of power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nah Man,</v>

228
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:17.960
<v Speaker 4>everything is clean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>

229
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 4>some big of those trenches,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jack.</v>

230
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.393
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That type of work gets you a tough </v>

231
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just a special athlete.</v>

232

<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's on AMC at six 30 and they locked </v>

321
00:14:33.521 --> 00:14:34.354
<v Speaker 2>the door and that you can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's eaten his shit and lost to the </v>

<v Speaker 2>here's the bikes and shit and he walks </v>
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

323
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.541
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a gentleman.</v>

325
00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:43.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem Ben.</v>

326
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.550
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do a thing and he walks up to the,</v>

327
00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I got to leave now you can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the collage euro,</v>

328
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 2>like that guy named son collage or</v>

329
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.860
<v Speaker 1>row who would do something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means you,</v>

330
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 1>you want your son to have the immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality,</v>

331
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 1>but when they throw that beat of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bike,</v>

332
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:02.150
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a true story.</v>

333
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.290
<v Speaker 1>That's a true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true story.</v>

334
00:15:04.291 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 1>I would listen in the 60s you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have long and walk around the Bronx.</v>

335
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't accent really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

336
00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.310
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hippy shit that,</v>

337
00:15:14.311 --> 00:15:14.671
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

338
00:15:14.671 --> 00:15:19.010
<v Speaker 1>that did happen in the Bronx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what if like a hippie was walking</v>

339
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:21.920
<v Speaker 1>through the Bronx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called you dirty hair day,</v>

340
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.740
<v Speaker 1>insulted you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They called you a bunch of shit and then</v>

341
00:15:24.741 --> 00:15:25.574
<v Speaker 1>they drew a beating on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's hysterical because that scene </v>

342
00:15:28.101 --> 00:15:32.090
<v Speaker 1>is so accurate because after the adults </v>
<v Speaker 1>drew have beaten on you,</v>

343
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:33.403
<v Speaker 1>then the May book kids chased you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the young kids with sticks and that's </v>

344
00:15:36.471 --> 00:15:38.210
<v Speaker 1>what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

345
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.140
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the little guys would chase you and</v>

346
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.410
<v Speaker 1>once you were beat up and they took all </v>

00:19:54.101 --> 00:19:55.930
<v Speaker 1>come to the store and there was a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>room with that.</v>

418
00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.273
<v Speaker 1>Chaz stole these stories from him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>put this together and there was like </v>

419
00:20:00.491 --> 00:20:02.710

423
00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.810
<v Speaker 1>but there's a story one time that a bike</v>

<v Speaker 1>sidewalk and broke his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gravano one night went out and </v>

<v Speaker 1>they beat up a bike.</v>

428
00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how true it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still remember being five.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

431
00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:39.631
<v Speaker 1>I could go back to being 1968,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1969 in the bronx.</v>

432
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:40.803
<v Speaker 1>My daughter's five and my mother would </v>
<v Speaker 1>send me from the dry cleaner that she </v>

433
00:20:45.071 --> 00:20:45.904
<v Speaker 1>owned to the corner where there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>place that had slices and Italian ice </v>

434
00:20:49.961 --> 00:20:50.880
<v Speaker 1>and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

435
00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.040
<v Speaker 1>Like I was allowed to walk to the corner</v>
<v Speaker 1>at mercy on Treemont Avenue.</v>

436
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:57.393
<v Speaker 1>Like I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking at my daughter when I was </v>

437
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.010
<v Speaker 1>watching Bronx.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going,</v>

<v Speaker 1>how different as time change.</v>

439
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.233
<v Speaker 1>Like I was allowed to go to a liquor </v>
<v Speaker 1>store with a note and get my mother </v>

440
00:21:07.031 --> 00:21:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Marlboro reds and bring them back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that neighborhood.</v>

441
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:11.674
<v Speaker 1>We didn't live there.</v>

442
00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:13.720
<v Speaker 1>My mother just had the dry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clean it up.</v>

443
00:21:13.721 --> 00:21:17.160
<v Speaker 1>There was a bookie numbers joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we had the dry cleaning.</v>

444
00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.930
<v Speaker 1>We were partners on the dry cleaner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know that?</v>

445
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I got scars on my face.</v>

446
00:21:22.121 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 1>I got bit by a German shepherd as a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those three by one of the eyes.</v>

447
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:29.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what we did when we came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

448
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I lived in two oh five west 88th street </v>
<v Speaker 1>and after my father died,</v>

449
00:21:32.681 --> 00:21:36.070
<v Speaker 1>my mother had a dry cleaner and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we were up.</v>

450
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:36.904
<v Speaker 1>We were up in Jerome Avenue and Treemont</v>
<v Speaker 1>and grand concourse and we had a dry </v>

451
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:42.124
<v Speaker 1>cleaner and every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every weekend I would go up there and I </v>

452
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:45.784
<v Speaker 1>would sit there with the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to dry clean and they had </v>

453
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:49.354
<v Speaker 1>black Mike Black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike was the guy that I ended </v>

454
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.273
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he made the best spaghetti in the </v>

455
00:21:53.351 --> 00:21:54.184
<v Speaker 1>bronx.</v>

456
00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:57.670
<v Speaker 1>So even the Italians came to he black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Spaghetti.</v>

457
00:21:57.671 --> 00:21:58.840

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

458
00:21:58.841 --> 00:21:59.674
<v Speaker 1>This was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew all that shit when I was a kid </v>

459
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:05.050
<v Speaker 1>because when you have a numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation,</v>

460
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep moving it around.</v>

461
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:11.530
<v Speaker 1>The cops can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to every three or four,</v>

462
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:12.364
<v Speaker 1>we should have to move it around </v>
<v Speaker 1>explaining numbers to people don't know </v>

463
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:15.500
<v Speaker 1>what the numbers is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

464
00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.050
<v Speaker 1>the Parimutuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

465
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.350
<v Speaker 1>the last three numbers of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Parimutuel,</v>

466
00:22:20.351 --> 00:22:21.184
<v Speaker 1>the track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the amount of track made for </v>

467
00:22:22.691 --> 00:22:24.790
<v Speaker 1>the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soak them track,</v>

468
00:22:24.791 --> 00:22:29.791
<v Speaker 1>made six hundred and eighty six thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>four hundred eighty two thousand dollars</v>

469
00:22:30.401 --> 00:22:35.260
<v Speaker 1>a number for the day is for 82 and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out as the Brooklyn number.</v>

470
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.050
<v Speaker 1>So there's three numbers a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Brooklyn,</v>

471
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.153
<v Speaker 1>the Bronx and New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what happened was that was a big </v>

472
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:47.551
<v Speaker 1>business until the 80s till the lotto </v>
<v Speaker 1>came out and the lotto cut that in half,</v>

473
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was all put it a little different.</v>

474
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.233
<v Speaker 1>Little different immigrant neighborhoods</v>
<v Speaker 1>all over New York City because as </v>

475
00:22:56.171 --> 00:22:58.480
<v Speaker 1>immigrants will one hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

476
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:02.230
<v Speaker 1>we know we want that money to get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator and the stove and shit like</v>

477
00:23:02.231 --> 00:23:03.064
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a weird thing that they would </v>

478
00:23:06.401 --> 00:23:07.950
<v Speaker 1>gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just $2 a day.</v>

479
00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Remember $2 a day when George thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars yeah,</v>

480
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:14.740
<v Speaker 1>I can do a lot in 1975 with $1,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>with two kids.</v>

481
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother was obsessed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

482
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:18.303
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was obsessed and she would always </v>

483
00:23:19.751 --> 00:23:20.584
<v Speaker 1>have like a number in her head that she </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was going to be and it was </v>

484
00:23:23.831 --> 00:23:26.770
<v Speaker 1>like one off or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like these stories she would tell</v>

485
00:23:26.771 --> 00:23:28.040
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say to,</v>

486
00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>what can I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like five.</v>

487
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.943
<v Speaker 1>I just remember it very distinctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandmother went to jail for running </v>

488
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:39.430
<v Speaker 1>numbers in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wouldn't,</v>

489
00:23:39.431 --> 00:23:42.160
<v Speaker 1>she wouldn't rat him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they put her in jail.</v>

490
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.280
<v Speaker 1>So she made sweaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave sweaters to the guards.</v>

491
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:46.783
<v Speaker 1>Mrs D,</v>

492
00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.803
<v Speaker 2>She's the nicest lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you feel that your grandmother had </v>

493
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:50.870
<v Speaker 2>done time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you think?</v>

494
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 2>We didn't find out until I was probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

495
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.523
<v Speaker 2>I wonder when I found out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe I found out my teenage </v>

496
00:23:56.931 --> 00:23:58.630
<v Speaker 2>years and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

497
00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.660
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck people are good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the year where is a,</v>

498
00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say my grandma's name </v>
<v Speaker 2>out a respect,</v>

499
00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 2>but people would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

500
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:09.710
<v Speaker 2>where is she?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

501
00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:11.480
<v Speaker 2>she went to visit her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her cousin,</v>

502
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.790
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants to see her aunt and she was,</v>

503
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>choosing the pokey for like six months.</v>

504
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I forget how much time it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every time we'd go over there it was</v>

505
00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:22.910
<v Speaker 2>like some new excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See It in New Jersey then put you in New</v>

506
00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:23.743
<v Speaker 2>Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They put you in jail for Gatling is </v>

507
00:24:24.951 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 2>bigger accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't give you a ticket.</v>

508
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.423
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would give you like a ticket and </v>

509
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.050
<v Speaker 2>shit in those days.</v>

510
00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.153
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it's like now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This fucking the employee in jail for </v>

511
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Speaker 2>weed down in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking know.</v>

512
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:36.733
<v Speaker 2>My grandmother was one of the few people</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've ever known where I legitimately </v>

513
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:44.390
<v Speaker 2>thought they had intuition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She has weird intuition.</v>

514
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.300
<v Speaker 2>She would do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real weird.</v>

515
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Like when my mother was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a rainstorm.</v>

516
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:52.783
<v Speaker 2>It was like real bad rain storm and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason my grandmother decided </v>

517
00:24:55.851 --> 00:24:56.684
<v Speaker 2>to wake my mother up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take her out of her bed and bring her </v>

518
00:24:57.981 --> 00:25:00.270
<v Speaker 2>downstairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some crazy hunched.</v>

519
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.113
<v Speaker 2>She had the ceilings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>claps like right above the bed where my </v>

520
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:07.580
<v Speaker 2>mom was sleeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like pieces of,</v>

521
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:08.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a lot,</v>

522
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.400
<v Speaker 2>it was just chunks of plaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like,</v>

523
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.323
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four pretty significant pieces </v>

524
00:25:13.191 --> 00:25:14.024
<v Speaker 2>of plaster fell off of the ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was rain came through with the whole </v>

525
00:25:17.181 --> 00:25:18.860
<v Speaker 2>deal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the ceiling game out.</v>

526
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.263
<v Speaker 2>Somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she had this idea in her head and it </v>

527
00:25:21.501 --> 00:25:22.334
<v Speaker 2>could be because she knew that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ceiling was fucked up and she knew it </v>

528
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:26.910
<v Speaker 2>was raining hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was probably going to give in any way</v>

529
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:30.080
<v Speaker 2>or she might've had an intuition and my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fault.</v>

530
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Everyone was always convinced it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuition.</v>

531
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's always convinced like she's </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks a little bit psychic.</v>

532
00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.290
<v Speaker 2>It was always weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was always weird around there.</v>

533
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.320
<v Speaker 2>She brought her monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a month in New Jersey.</v>

534
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in north New Jersey.</v>

535

<v Speaker 2>you everybody,</v>

536
00:25:46.801 --> 00:25:47.634

<v Speaker 2>my grandfather made it keep the monkey </v>

537

<v Speaker 2>him?</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandma was crazy.</v>

542
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:10.230
<v Speaker 2>Italian people had butches and they'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>get you anything.</v>

543
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:14.070
<v Speaker 2>She can't look game pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She kept a monkey in the house,</v>

551
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:27.663
<v Speaker 2>I think he tried to bite my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was one of those things they </v>

552
00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:35.120
<v Speaker 2>might have bit my cousin some when our </v>
<v Speaker 2>family got pit ever touched him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>no disrespect,</v>

556
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:48.930
<v Speaker 2>but once you get those lunar texts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that option that they do have intuition,</v>

<v Speaker 2>zoot don't do shit.</v>

559
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.190
<v Speaker 2>You got to listen to all her cooking was</v>
<v Speaker 2>from another planet.</v>

560
00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:04.170
<v Speaker 2>It's from another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like pure immigrant cooking.</v>

561
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Like the pasta that was design.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You just sit there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit just perfect.</v>

563
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.470
<v Speaker 2>Just knew exactly what supposed to be in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

564
00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.520
<v Speaker 2>She baked her own,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like she would make her own macaroni,</v>

565
00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:23.880
<v Speaker 2>should make our own Ravioli.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She would stuff her own Ravioli.</v>

566
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:27.090
<v Speaker 2>She'd be out there rolling and flatten </v>
<v Speaker 2>out flour and shit,</v>

567
00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:29.430
<v Speaker 2>throwing the flower on top of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flatten it out.</v>

568
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:32.130
<v Speaker 2>She was a wizard though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually get a monkey,</v>

569
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:32.964
<v Speaker 2>call it cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta respect a little monkey and </v>

570
00:27:34.861 --> 00:27:37.170
<v Speaker 2>keep her head though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either respectful for grandma.</v>

571
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.840
<v Speaker 2>My grandma was a special lady.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was powerful.</v>

572
00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Once you give those,</v>

573
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:42.540
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid,</v>

574
00:27:42.541 --> 00:27:45.180
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to my buddy's judo school.</v>

575
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:46.403
<v Speaker 1>I didn't join.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just went down there to see what it </v>

576
00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:50.520
<v Speaker 1>was like and it was hidden in union </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

577
00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:55.970
<v Speaker 1>It was on seventh street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I knew that my step dad played cards</v>

578
00:27:56.041 --> 00:27:58.470
<v Speaker 1>on ninth street on Wednesdays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

579
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.543
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew my stepdad played cards down </v>

581
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.533
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they'd gamble in this little club </v>

582
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.550
<v Speaker 1>and I had to be maybe 10 but because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>grew up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I always had my eyes out as a kid.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that man at the end,</v>

585
00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:15.653

<v Speaker 1>noticed unmarked police cars and I went </v>

<v Speaker 1>And for some reason,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I know you're going to play it back home</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>

594
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 1>And they looked at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was getting dressed a suit on.</v>

597
00:28:55.411 --> 00:28:57.360
<v Speaker 1>nines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said to him,</v>

598
00:28:57.361 --> 00:28:58.200
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

599
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.233
<v Speaker 1>today I went down there to go to Martins</v>
<v Speaker 1>judo school and I saw a bunch of them </v>

600
00:29:03.481 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 1>marked cards down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was you,</v>

601
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't go out to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He fucking just looked at me.</v>

602
00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.710
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love you.</v>

603
00:29:10.711 --> 00:29:12.630
<v Speaker 1>And he walked down the stairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got in the car,</v>

604
00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:14.430
<v Speaker 1>started it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened the garage bro.</v>

605
00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:15.983
<v Speaker 1>And 10 minutes later I heard the car </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned off in the garage close and they </v>

606
00:29:18.511 --> 00:29:20.040
<v Speaker 1>came up and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>

607
00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And he made Sundays for me and him and </v>
<v Speaker 1>next morning and that card place,</v>

608
00:29:24.631 --> 00:29:25.464
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they would listen to me on the </v>

609
00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:29.013
<v Speaker 1>housing.</v>

610
00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.410
<v Speaker 2>I had these fucking moron,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my spouse.</v>

611
00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:35.500
<v Speaker 2>But you want me to tell you what else I </v>
<v Speaker 2>did?</v>

612
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:36.493
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is me and like me and my </v>

613
00:29:38.101 --> 00:29:42.430
<v Speaker 1>stepdad had this weird relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to an age where I wanted my mother</v>

614
00:29:42.431 --> 00:29:45.430
<v Speaker 1>from myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what the feeling is dry on when</v>

615
00:29:45.431 --> 00:29:46.264
<v Speaker 1>we've all gone through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you lose a dad and your mom </v>

616
00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:49.444
<v Speaker 1>remarries that comes up a day that he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to tell you what's going on </v>

617
00:29:52.781 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

618
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:56.013
<v Speaker 1>I just want you to know that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the mother fucker that runs this </v>

619
00:29:57.971 --> 00:30:00.580
<v Speaker 1>joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be sleeping with my mum,</v>

620
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:04.120
<v Speaker 1>but I run this motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once I gave him that advice,</v>

621
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.600
<v Speaker 1>like it really for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then him and I would go in a float.</v>

622
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.020
<v Speaker 1>I kept stealing his coins from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

623
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.840
<v Speaker 1>He had this sand Laszlo thing and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was everything to him.</v>

624
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.003
<v Speaker 1>So he had this big bottle of like scotch</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was empty and he would put silver </v>

625
00:30:18.581 --> 00:30:20.680
<v Speaker 1>dollars in there and I would steal them.</v>

626
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.740
<v Speaker 1>And from time to time he would come home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go,</v>

627
00:30:23.741 --> 00:30:26.980
<v Speaker 1>that bottle's looking like somebody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>stealing my car.</v>

628
00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 1>I destroyed his mind for you because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very particular man.</v>

629
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.500
<v Speaker 1>So he had different bundles of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I gotta tell you something,</v>

630
00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:36.334
<v Speaker 1>I respect them today because I saw him </v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of the joint and I show what he </v>

631
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:42.740
<v Speaker 1>did with bookmaking and how he became </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of,</v>

632
00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 1>it's on a butcher shop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started businesses,</v>

633
00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 1>he started different businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

634
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:48.783
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after I saved this that night with the </v>

635

<v Speaker 1>rocky would listen to me.</v>

636
00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.420
<v Speaker 1>And then one day I went and I signed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>for biddy basketball and union city.</v>

<v Speaker 1>address and they gave you a tee shirt.</v>

<v Speaker 1>They put you on the team and they gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>me a number.</v>

641
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.171

<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people do not know what </v>

<v Speaker 1>diamonds in it.</v>

669
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.190
<v Speaker 1>That's how spics ran in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

670
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:31.420
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I had them there,</v>

671
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:32.590
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had him,</v>

672
00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:35.440
<v Speaker 1>he trusted me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he trusted my eyes.</v>

673
00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.140
<v Speaker 1>So one night we're in union city and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking went somewhere.</v>

674
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.093
<v Speaker 1>The walk back,</v>

675
00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.343
<v Speaker 3>there's a place called pastoral music </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there was next to the new moon </v>

676
00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:44.534
<v Speaker 3>Chinese restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I show a bunch of unmarked cars and </v>

677
00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:49.124
<v Speaker 3>I never forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went back to the bar and then he'd go </v>

678
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:51.500
<v Speaker 3>out and I told him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

679
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 3>dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw three on my,</v>

680
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:57.670
<v Speaker 3>like I had him and I seen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen three on my cars up to corner.</v>

681
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:02.060
<v Speaker 3>He was very always scared of the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even though he was a bookmaker,</v>

682
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 3>he never used the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan never used the phone.</v>

683
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:07.880
<v Speaker 3>And he would never have a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>close to a phone.</v>

684
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.260
<v Speaker 3>This is because he always felt he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like phones.</v>

685
00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.720
<v Speaker 3>He did everything like a pigeon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

686
00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.033
<v Speaker 3>he would write the numbers and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>little piece of paper real small and </v>

687
00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:22.460
<v Speaker 3>fold them up and put him in his hat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if he ever saw cops,</v>

688
00:33:22.461 --> 00:33:24.140
<v Speaker 3>he would just eat the piece of paper.</v>

689
00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:26.443
<v Speaker 3>He didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He always had the piece of paper </v>

690
00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.090
<v Speaker 3>somewhere close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you would put it in this ring.</v>

691
00:33:32.091 --> 00:33:34.820
<v Speaker 3>This motherfucker was a savage dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It wasn't for him.</v>

694
00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.410

737
00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.353

760
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:55.483
<v Speaker 1>Let's get something out of the way here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest percentage of degenerate </v>

761
00:36:59.271 --> 00:37:00.104
<v Speaker 1>gamblers are usually women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look this fucking percentage up </v>

00:37:03.171 --> 00:37:05.660
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women go fucking deep.</v>

763
00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:09.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucking hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck about nothing.</v>

764
00:37:09.741 --> 00:37:11.720
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fucking play cards.</v>

765
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Women fucking bang it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

766
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.420
<v Speaker 1>And they bang it out while you're at </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

767
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan while I'm at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They start with a horse.</v>

768
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Then they go to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those little promos they do,</v>

769
00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:25.194
<v Speaker 1>and in Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they say when you know when </v>

770
00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic City was Atlantic City,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you went to union city,</v>

771
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:32.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pay 15 bucks to get on a bus.</v>

772
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:35.690
<v Speaker 1>They gave you a coupon book and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to Atlantic city,</v>

773
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:40.100
<v Speaker 1>they give it $15 in quarters back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that basically driving you to fucking</v>

774
00:37:40.101 --> 00:37:43.490
<v Speaker 1>gamble and drive back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in gambling.</v>

775
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I believe in making your living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that it's an itch.</v>

776
00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.920
<v Speaker 1>It's an illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

777
00:37:48.921 --> 00:37:52.790
<v Speaker 1>but when you're losing your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got,</v>

778
00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.540
<v Speaker 1>that's where I want to know where.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it bothers me.</v>

779
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just like cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a drug abuse.</v>

780
00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:00.463
<v Speaker 1>It's just like the opiate problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not any even fucking thing </v>

781
00:38:02.601 --> 00:38:04.160
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could fucking,</v>

782
00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you and I both know people who have lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>their fucking lives.</v>

783
00:38:08.481 --> 00:38:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

784
00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:13.610
<v Speaker 1>You've seen people in pool halls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see how they get Joe Rogan.</v>

785
00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.850
<v Speaker 1>There's no difference in the drug addict</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the gambling addict.</v>

786
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Not at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no difference</v>

787
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:20.380
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just a scary too,</v>

788
00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:23.470
<v Speaker 4>because they're conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you've seen the drug act,</v>

789
00:38:23.471 --> 00:38:25.270
<v Speaker 4>you see him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's shooting up or whatever it is,</v>

790
00:38:25.271 --> 00:38:28.390
<v Speaker 4>and you see him fainting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go out of their poor bastard.</v>

791
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:31.660
<v Speaker 4>But when you see a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's fully in the grips of gambling,</v>

792
00:38:31.661 --> 00:38:33.610
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out how to make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get his money back,</v>

793
00:38:33.611 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 4>and he's all jazzed up with adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't understand why,</v>

794
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:38.710
<v Speaker 1>see there's gamblers like Michael </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan.</v>

795
00:38:38.711 --> 00:38:39.544
<v Speaker 1>Then there's gamblers like Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gamblers who have the means to </v>

796
00:38:42.941 --> 00:38:46.390
<v Speaker 1>gamble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a fucking killer.</v>

797
00:38:46.391 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Also like on Michael Jordan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan.</v>

798
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:52.630
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying nothing bad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jordan accusations that you hear</v>

799
00:38:52.631 --> 00:38:56.010
<v Speaker 1>that he even bets on his own while I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>one basketball games.</v>

800
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

801
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.960
<v Speaker 1>he was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

802
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now how Joey Diaz was doing it,</v>

803
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:03.963
<v Speaker 1>not how people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Barkley lost nearly $30 million </v>

804
00:39:07.091 --> 00:39:10.440
<v Speaker 1>gambling it to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's this Charles,</v>

805
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:11.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

854
00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.693
<v Speaker 3>If they had a problem playing scrabble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would call up the parker brothers </v>

855
00:42:16.821 --> 00:42:17.654
<v Speaker 3>hotline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick Mobsters would to dispute the </v>

856

<v Speaker 1>about garbage.</v>

862
00:42:41.951 --> 00:42:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Man was a real word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Garbage man cafe.</v>

863
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.353
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

864
00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gambling is a fucking nightmare and once</v>

865
00:42:52.261 --> 00:42:56.250
<v Speaker 3>you get caught in the web and you enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 3>rogue and shuts me down,</v>

866
00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:01.550
<v Speaker 3>then I start putting batch with Jamie </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then pretty soon I start plucking,</v>

867
00:43:01.831 --> 00:43:05.790
<v Speaker 3>dipping into accounts and pretty soon </v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're done.</v>

868
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:06.743
<v Speaker 3>Now you get forced into a bad hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told you that I was a backer on the </v>

869
00:43:10.081 --> 00:43:12.150
<v Speaker 3>road for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Johnny B,</v>

870
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.350
<v Speaker 3>when I started making money doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup,</v>

871
00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:15.253
<v Speaker 3>I put together a little bankroll and me </v>
<v Speaker 3>and him would go places and gamble and </v>

872
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.390
<v Speaker 3>he would win or lose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

873
00:43:21.391 --> 00:43:23.220
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes he'd win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you lose,</v>

874
00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.320
<v Speaker 3>but it was just uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being an action.</v>

875
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.030
<v Speaker 3>It was fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

876
00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:27.864
<v Speaker 3>that kind of gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was never good enough to like </v>

877
00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:30.443
<v Speaker 3>play those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I could play like people that were </v>

878
00:43:32.491 --> 00:43:33.324
<v Speaker 3>like my level and you'd bet like 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks or maybe if you want to get crazy </v>

879
00:43:36.871 --> 00:43:39.570
<v Speaker 3>about like 50 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never bet like a lot of money gambling</v>

880
00:43:39.571 --> 00:43:41.610
<v Speaker 3>on pool,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it makes you think more,</v>

881
00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.910
<v Speaker 3>it makes you play like way more serious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's good for your game.</v>

882
00:43:44.911 --> 00:43:47.130
<v Speaker 3>And if you can have a friendly sparring </v>
<v Speaker 3>partner,</v>

883
00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:52.520
<v Speaker 3>they play friendly games like maybe a </v>
<v Speaker 3>race to seven for 20 bucks.</v>

884
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.240
<v Speaker 3>So it's costs you probably in any city </v>
<v Speaker 3>pool halls,</v>

885
00:43:57.241 --> 00:44:00.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the rate is per hour,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they gotta be like at least 20 bucks</v>

886
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.930
<v Speaker 3>for once and for all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to break it down from it.</v>

887
00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:09.750
<v Speaker 3>I walked into a pool hall with Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

888
00:44:09.751 --> 00:44:13.980
<v Speaker 3>I got 10 g's cash in my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie's my main man.</v>

889
00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:14.903
<v Speaker 3>How do I exactly make money and why is </v>
<v Speaker 3>it that the people the room passing </v>

890
00:44:18.721 --> 00:44:21.930
<v Speaker 3>money around and how does that money get</v>
<v Speaker 3>dispersed?</v>

891
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.260
<v Speaker 3>It was real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody puts like you put in,</v>

892
00:44:25.261 --> 00:44:26.094
<v Speaker 3>I'm in for 120 matches one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it depends on who's putting it together </v>

893
00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.250
<v Speaker 3>cause they might decide to just in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>their money</v>

894
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.850
<v Speaker 4>like everybody put in on one side pool </v>
<v Speaker 4>in money and you know,</v>

895
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:39.150
<v Speaker 4>and and back this guy or they might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>betting on the side.</v>

896
00:44:39.151 --> 00:44:41.700
<v Speaker 4>They might not even be playing the game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's always a side bets.</v>

897
00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:45.060
<v Speaker 4>Side bets are probably more like if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a bet,</v>

898
00:44:45.061 --> 00:44:49.440
<v Speaker 4>if you had like a big pool game right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There used to be a place called uh,</v>

899
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:52.320
<v Speaker 4>w what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Western billiards.</v>

900
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.950
<v Speaker 4>I think in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>west end,</v>

901

903
00:45:01.051 --> 00:45:01.884
<v Speaker 4>We would take the drive from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm from New York to go down in New </v>

<v Speaker 4>would have these like serious high level</v>

906
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:16.224

<v Speaker 4>You go there and watch people play for </v>

907
00:45:18.751 --> 00:45:21.000
<v Speaker 4>$5,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>$10,000</v>

908
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.490

<v Speaker 4>there all the time.</v>

909
00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.290
<v Speaker 4>I got to play against some of the best </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>

910
00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.290
<v Speaker 4>They killed me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I got to play again against him.</v>

<v Speaker 4>huge like where you have to get invited </v>

918
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:51.270
<v Speaker 4>so that those joey dee has come onto the</v>
<v Speaker 4>side and go,</v>

919
00:45:51.271 --> 00:45:53.660
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm putting three to one hud's on this.</v>

920
00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:55.070
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people definitely,</v>

921
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:56.790
<v Speaker 4>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a side.</v>

922
00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:57.610
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

923
00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.160
<v Speaker 4>that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how the pool,</v>

924
00:45:59.161 --> 00:46:01.170
<v Speaker 4>we got 100 bucks on archer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

925
00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.460
<v Speaker 4>you'd never seen this diaz kid play.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got a hundred ideas and dudes,</v>

926
00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.630
<v Speaker 4>I'll take that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take that and then you just work it</v>

927
00:46:06.631 --> 00:46:08.160
<v Speaker 4>out and everybody works it out.</v>

928
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.233
<v Speaker 4>But when sometimes guys will get </v>
<v Speaker 4>together and back somebody to like say </v>

929
00:46:11.791 --> 00:46:12.624
<v Speaker 4>if you got it like a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a really good player and this guy </v>

930
00:46:14.891 --> 00:46:17.970
<v Speaker 4>is coming in from out of town and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>wants to take a crack at him and go,</v>

931
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.590
<v Speaker 4>well he wants to play $100 sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

932
00:46:20.591 --> 00:46:22.280
<v Speaker 4>And then you have to think how many </v>
<v Speaker 4>barrels do we have?</v>

933
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.670
<v Speaker 4>You Pool your money together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

934
00:46:23.671 --> 00:46:24.504
<v Speaker 4>we got four barrels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That means if he wants to play sets we </v>

935
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:27.894
<v Speaker 4>can lose four times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have to be able to lose a couple </v>

936
00:46:30.251 --> 00:46:31.084
<v Speaker 4>of gain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A couple,</v>

937
00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 4>like if you're going to really play a </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy out,</v>

938
00:46:32.701 --> 00:46:33.534
<v Speaker 4>these guys would play 10 12 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we keep going back and forth and </v>

939
00:46:36.331 --> 00:46:37.720
<v Speaker 4>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

940
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:38.910
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

941
00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.970
<v Speaker 4>Like I've seen guys and you would see </v>
<v Speaker 4>him the next day.</v>

942
00:46:41.971 --> 00:46:44.100
<v Speaker 4>They'd still be playing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd go there in the morning,</v>

943
00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.600
<v Speaker 4>they'd be playing all through the night.</v>

944
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:49.410
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the fuck they were on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most likely some sort of emphatic means.</v>

945
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:51.690
<v Speaker 4>That was a big thing and the pool world </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a while,</v>

946
00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.240
<v Speaker 4>guys would just break each other with </v>
<v Speaker 4>gambling.</v>

947
00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.400
<v Speaker 4>It would just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would be about who quits.</v>

948
00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.640
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be about who won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very rarely about like,</v>

949
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:01.500
<v Speaker 4>you know like you would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be,</v>

950
00:47:01.530 --> 00:47:06.030
<v Speaker 4>you would be frowned upon highly if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>left on top.</v>

951
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:11.050
<v Speaker 4>Say if you're ahead by 500 bucks and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to quit me and,</v>

952
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:13.620
<v Speaker 4>and I'm still ready,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ready to keep playing,</v>

953
00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:14.610
<v Speaker 4>I still got more money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

954
00:47:14.611 --> 00:47:17.160
<v Speaker 4>Let me win my money back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you just walked away,</v>

955
00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:18.570
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got what I wanted.</v>

956
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:20.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to leave now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that would be,</v>

957
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:23.250
<v Speaker 4>you'd be what's called bad action,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but guys,</v>

00:47:23.251 --> 00:47:26.130
<v Speaker 4>I've got two kids are having to get up </v>
<v Speaker 4>at seven and go to the pool hall.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Right when you exit then there's a strip</v>

<v Speaker 2>times to eat.</v>

00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:24.160
<v Speaker 2>We did comedy there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember Hollywood billy and you took me</v>

982
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>next time I drove by and I was like,</v>

983

<v Speaker 2>dead with the a couple times we played </v>

984
00:48:40.991 --> 00:48:42.930
<v Speaker 2>pool there are a bunch of tiny chip </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

985
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.790
<v Speaker 2>Bunch of times that place was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

986
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.640
<v Speaker 2>That whole area is completely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where I met.</v>

987
00:48:48.641 --> 00:48:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Max are bully.</v>

988
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:51.531
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

989
00:48:51.531 --> 00:48:53.530
<v Speaker 2>like that dude can play some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>pool.</v>

990
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you play Max separately,</v>

991
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:56.710
<v Speaker 2>how much drive to pull it up guy?</v>

992
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:58.750
<v Speaker 2>He's still put them on the one I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>get tortured.</v>

993
00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 2>You would have to bet like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go to,</v>

994
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:04.240
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to bet on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a guy like Max eberly.</v>

995
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:07.750
<v Speaker 2>He's top of the food chain as far as his</v>
<v Speaker 2>technique and delivery.</v>

996
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 2>He could win a world championship </v>
<v Speaker 2>tournament.</v>

997
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Like legitimately he's that good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no chance.</v>

998
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:16.300
<v Speaker 2>Like if if we played 12 games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might win a couple.</v>

999
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.760
<v Speaker 2>I might get lucky and win a few.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I went for,</v>

1000
00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:19.993
<v Speaker 2>he's getting way more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to get to 12 for sure </v>

1001
00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.350
<v Speaker 2>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be a terrible bat.</v>

1002
00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:25.780
<v Speaker 2>The bat would be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many games did I get too?</v>

1003
00:49:26.260 --> 00:49:27.093
<v Speaker 2>That'd be the bat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say you'll never get past three </v>

1004
00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.250
<v Speaker 2>because a guy like max tablet can run 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>racks in a row and I'm not exaggerating.</v>

1005
00:49:33.251 --> 00:49:34.084
<v Speaker 2>I've seen him do it.</v>

1006
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Blam breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>runs 10 racks in a row,</v>

1007
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.680
<v Speaker 2>but to the point where you're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1008
00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:40.870
<v Speaker 2>he did it in Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were all hanging out.</v>

1009
00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it was man was an Ari.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who came with me.</v>

1010
00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.000
<v Speaker 2>How could you forget?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys are going to the Italian place.</v>

1011
00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:49.923
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That place was amazing and that's </v>

1012
00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.070
<v Speaker 2>exactly what Max Max's plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1013
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.400
<v Speaker 2>he would break and run out on guys and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they would just get frustrated.</v>

1014
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.170
<v Speaker 2>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck man?</v>

1015
00:49:59.290 --> 00:50:00.640
<v Speaker 2>They just get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get to shoot.</v>

1016
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:01.743
<v Speaker 2>We watched him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was gambling some guy and when the </v>

1017
00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:05.283
<v Speaker 2>set was over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy was just pissed off because Max </v>

1018
00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.790
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

1019
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:10.624
<v Speaker 2>Just watch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's playing a guy that really just </v>

1020
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 2>wanted to take a chance and play like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the food chain guy and he gambled</v>

1021
00:50:17.201 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 2>with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just watching the difference between</v>

1022
00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:20.494
<v Speaker 2>a kid who can play a little pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty good versus a world </v>

1023
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.420
<v Speaker 2>championship caliber pool play.</v>

1024
00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.320
<v Speaker 2>They're so precise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1025
00:50:27.330 --> 00:50:31.870
<v Speaker 2>because technique is so clean and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>angles are perfect and he's just efforts</v>

1026
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 2>effortlessly move in the cue ball on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>table to where he wants it.</v>

1027
00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.480
<v Speaker 2>He sees clusters and problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wayne advance and breaks them up.</v>

1028
00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:40.790
<v Speaker 2>It's so high level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my boy.</v>

1029
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.020
<v Speaker 2>That's Max Albert Lea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He taught me how to play pool.</v>

1030

1074
00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:36.220

<v Speaker 2>Before we started,</v>

1075
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:37.650
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1076
00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.080
<v Speaker 2>4.8</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion.</v>

<v Speaker 2>well 3% will happen in Nevada.</v>

1078
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.113
<v Speaker 2>Only 3% so most of it online online was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Chris Christie thing you pulled up </v>

1079
00:52:48.261 --> 00:52:48.861
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>James,</v>

1080
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:51.470
<v Speaker 2>listen,G</v>
<v Speaker 2>and banks,</v>

1081
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:55.190
<v Speaker 2>banks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's still people who are like a,</v>

1082
00:52:55.191 --> 00:52:57.500
<v Speaker 2>you know they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got a ton of loot.</v>

1083
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Chris Christie goes to the Supreme Court</v>
<v Speaker 2>on sports betting.</v>

1084
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Is he trying to get sports betting?</v>

1085
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:02.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lives,</v>

1086
00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.773
<v Speaker 3>they passed something in a Jersey I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think in 2011 to allow betting and </v>

1087
00:53:07.381 --> 00:53:08.214
<v Speaker 3>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still only a lot of vegas </v>

1088
00:53:09.241 --> 00:53:11.610
<v Speaker 3>because of the whatever law there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>back on your team,</v>

1089
00:53:11.611 --> 00:53:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Chris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:14.700
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he has a few problems,</v>

1091
00:53:14.730 --> 00:53:17.760
<v Speaker 3>but we all do 17 states also with them </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this.</v>

1092
00:53:17.761 --> 00:53:20.400
<v Speaker 3>I think I want to do it so he would </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

1093
00:53:20.401 --> 00:53:22.770
<v Speaker 3>he opposed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They wanted again,</v>

1094
00:53:22.771 --> 00:53:23.604
<v Speaker 3>they want betting again because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>have an NHL team in Vegas and that's </v>

1095
00:53:25.291 --> 00:53:26.124
<v Speaker 3>always been like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the logic is that there'll be some </v>

1096
00:53:28.321 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 3>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

1097
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:31.560
<v Speaker 3>You can't not be betting where their </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports being played because someone will</v>

1098
00:53:31.561 --> 00:53:32.394
<v Speaker 3>throw the game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody should be able to bet every </v>

1099
00:53:33.721 --> 00:53:34.554
<v Speaker 3>city she'll do whatever you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to talk to you going to do </v>

1100
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:42.250
<v Speaker 3>these games though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

1101
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by these games you see or</v>
<v Speaker 3>hypnotizing ladies and going crazy,</v>

1102
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.830
<v Speaker 3>losing all their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their money.</v>

1103
00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:47.733
<v Speaker 3>That was 60 minutes did a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he bought a whole piece on these games </v>

1104
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:56.910
<v Speaker 3>are like laser ish and people actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>put the percentage was higher.</v>

1105
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:01.110
<v Speaker 3>Most women because of its,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1106
00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.900
<v Speaker 3>so let me explain something to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's your view.</v>

1107
00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:07.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just uh,</v>

1108
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.410
<v Speaker 3>it's like video games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more like gambling.</v>

1109
00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:14.490
<v Speaker 3>It's very fucking so addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a video game,</v>

1110
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:15.324
<v Speaker 3>but also the gambling very game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's what the beef was to remove </v>

1111
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:23.040
<v Speaker 3>these type of games because I'm telling </v>
<v Speaker 3>you since I was a kid,</v>

1112
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.500
<v Speaker 3>I always first off,</v>

1113
00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:26.260
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1114
00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.380
<v Speaker 3>I lived with my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had a lot of proms,</v>

1115
00:54:29.381 --> 00:54:30.214
<v Speaker 3>shovel out your rate issues,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was a degenerate gambler on </v>

1116
00:54:32.841 --> 00:54:33.674
<v Speaker 3>baseball</v>

1117
00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.880
<v Speaker 3>between the Boston Red Sox and the New </v>
<v Speaker 3>York mets.</v>

1118
00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:41.910
<v Speaker 3>They killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They killed her.</v>

1119
00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:46.400
<v Speaker 3>And I saw the decline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw what did that,</v>

1120
00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:49.770
<v Speaker 3>I saw a person watched two baseball </v>
<v Speaker 3>games at the same time.</v>

1121
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 3>I remember in those days you didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a split screen and direct TV.</v>

1122
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:57.510
<v Speaker 3>So if you were Puerto Rican,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you took one pv and you put it on top of</v>

1123
00:54:57.511 --> 00:55:02.410
<v Speaker 3>the other TV and you got fucking MBC and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had cable with it,</v>

1124
00:55:02.411 --> 00:55:03.244
<v Speaker 3>came with the cord member with Hbo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>still had the cord to the fucking thing </v>

1125
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:13.050
<v Speaker 3>and it was a thing with a box that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressed and you switched three levels in</v>

1126
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:18.051
<v Speaker 3>those days may be there was no edit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no aba package or NBA package.</v>

1127
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.153
<v Speaker 3>You got like one other game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we would pray that it would be the </v>

1128
00:55:22.831 --> 00:55:23.664
<v Speaker 3>Boston red sox and she would watch both </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking games and gamble at the same </v>

1129
00:55:27.001 --> 00:55:27.834
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>

1130
00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:29.640
<v Speaker 3>not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The numbers,</v>

1131
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:31.163
<v Speaker 3>if she had a dream about a goat bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she had a dream about going back to </v>

1132
00:55:34.891 --> 00:55:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

1133
00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Your family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if she had a dream about,</v>

1134
00:55:39.600 --> 00:55:41.850
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing her daughter,</v>

1135
00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a number they would call her.</v>

1136
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:47.520
<v Speaker 3>They would call her at a quarter to </v>
<v Speaker 3>three because she had all that,</v>

1137
00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:51.150
<v Speaker 3>all those contacts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was that gambling.</v>

1138
00:55:51.151 --> 00:55:54.830
<v Speaker 3>Then there was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then there was the track addiction.</v>

1139
00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:55.910
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

1140
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:58.910
<v Speaker 3>Which started at aqueduct in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>afternoon.</v>

1141
00:55:59.120 --> 00:55:59.953
<v Speaker 3>If the sun was shining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was my excuse to go to aqua duck </v>

1142
00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.250
<v Speaker 3>from my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let me go to act with duck pasta.</v>

1143
00:56:04.251 --> 00:56:05.084
<v Speaker 3>You had three after school and she'd be </v>
<v Speaker 3>there at three but the whole time she'd </v>

1144
00:56:08.181 --> 00:56:10.790
<v Speaker 3>be scratching because the meadowlands </v>
<v Speaker 3>started at eight</v>

1145
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:12.923
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

1146
00:56:12.930 --> 00:56:16.030
<v Speaker 3>She knew she could catch the metal lands</v>
<v Speaker 3>at eight so guess what happens is,</v>

1147
00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.380
<v Speaker 3>is that if you lose the eight o'clock </v>
<v Speaker 3>meadowlands what?</v>

1148
00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:23.200
<v Speaker 3>You haul your ass to yonkers with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>death of death.</v>

1149
00:56:23.740 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 3>This is</v>

1150
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.400
<v Speaker 1>where you go to before you go to a pool </v>
<v Speaker 1>or this or your blood.</v>

1151
00:56:27.700 --> 00:56:30.580
<v Speaker 1>You go to yonkers raceway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand me?</v>

1152
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been to yonkers raceway?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1153
00:56:33.461 --> 00:56:36.310
<v Speaker 1>You leave there with a corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one where do you think you're going?</v>

1154
00:56:36.610 --> 00:56:39.880
<v Speaker 1>You either going to sell your soul or </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you a blood.</v>

1155
00:56:39.881 --> 00:56:42.730
<v Speaker 1>She'd go shoot pool because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saving the day.</v>

1156
00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:45.540
<v Speaker 1>You cannot go home a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1157
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:47.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all day gambling.</v>

1158
00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was her thing.</v>

1159
00:56:49.871 --> 00:56:54.871
<v Speaker 1>So I also grew up in an Italian family </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the mother was a chow away.</v>

1160
00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.820
<v Speaker 1>It was like a fucking act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like an act.</v>

1161
00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:03.880
<v Speaker 1>She had three kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were tremendous kids.</v>

1162
00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I knew the husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he worked for a big corporation,</v>

1163
00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.000
<v Speaker 1>they drove a nice car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went to church.</v>

1164
00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:11.183
<v Speaker 1>But on Saturdays when I go over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would always go with your mom and </v>

1165
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:17.010
<v Speaker 1>they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom plays cards with uh,</v>

1166
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:20.320
<v Speaker 1>with the Rogan's and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this name.</v>

1167
00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:23.260
<v Speaker 1>But why as I got older one day somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>said to me,</v>

1168
00:57:23.261 --> 00:57:24.094
<v Speaker 1>don't be careful when you go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they might shoot that lady in the </v>

1169
00:57:28.031 --> 00:57:29.830
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows like 600 down.</v>

1170
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I was a kid,</v>

1171
00:57:32.111 --> 00:57:34.360
<v Speaker 1>I was like 13 and somebody came to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

1172
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:38.470
<v Speaker 1>be careful when you go with it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mom's a little bit on the those card</v>

1173
00:57:38.471 --> 00:57:41.290
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as I got ahold of,</v>

1174
00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.870
<v Speaker 1>they're scared for your life from a card</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

1175
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Magic being scared for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1176
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:48.550
<v Speaker 1>it was a different game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how they suck you in.</v>

1177
00:57:48.551 --> 00:57:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the people now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also grew up with men,</v>

1178
00:57:51.431 --> 00:57:53.890
<v Speaker 1>degenerate gamblers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know all of the symptoms.</v>

1179
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I know the itch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

1180
00:57:56.111 --> 00:58:00.210
<v Speaker 1>this thing on 60 minutes just spoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this addiction with uh,</v>

1181
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:03.070
<v Speaker 1>a computer thing with women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

1182
00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:03.903
<v Speaker 1>That was really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know how it fucking creeps up on </v>

1183
00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:09.514
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a couple of years ago it's </v>

1184
00:58:10.511 --> 00:58:12.250
<v Speaker 1>called the slot machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big gamble.</v>

1185
00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's just slot machines in general.</v>

1186
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:17.650
<v Speaker 1>These type of slot machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Computer ones,</v>

1187
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:18.484
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have an effect on women in </v>

1188
00:58:19.751 --> 00:58:21.310
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

1189
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck up ladies.</v>

1190
00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.930
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No dog.</v>

1191
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Here's my take on this whole gambling </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1192
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Like you remember horse bedding in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York?</v>

1193
00:58:29.921 --> 00:58:32.280
<v Speaker 1>Like you'd go to the horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go to the track better.</v>

1194
00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:33.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was right there.</v>

1195
00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made that for a reason.</v>

1196
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean it just trying to make it legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is legal.</v>

1197
00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says legal.</v>

1198
00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:41.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to take a piece.</v>

1199
00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Jerome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want that piece.</v>

1200
00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to a medical marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 1>store recently?</v>

1201
00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:47.231
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

1202
00:58:47.231 --> 00:58:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they like,</v>

1203
00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:53.250
<v Speaker 1>if it's $60 your tab is now $76 cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tax,</v>

1204
00:58:53.411 --> 00:58:54.244
<v Speaker 1>it's $16 in taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you buy something for $60 the thing </v>

1205
00:58:57.941 --> 00:58:58.774
<v Speaker 1>about weed though is it goes so far I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about how much like $100 worth of </v>

1206
00:59:03.311 --> 00:59:04.144
<v Speaker 1>weed goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be on the moon for three days </v>

1207
00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.280
<v Speaker 1>for three days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be on the moon with the proper</v>

1208
00:59:12.281 --> 00:59:15.430
<v Speaker 1>edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a $100 worth of the proper edibles.</v>

1209
00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:16.803
<v Speaker 1>How much do you think you can handle?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many jumbos do you think you can </v>

1210

<v Speaker 3>I felt my cells,</v>

1215
00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:31.723
<v Speaker 3>I felt all the cells in my bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like were the tendons connected </v>

1216
00:59:35.811 --> 00:59:36.644
<v Speaker 3>on my spine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's like you could get fucking </v>

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:44.240
<v Speaker 3>blasted on and then the last 12 hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then take the other half.</v>

1263
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:46.740
<v Speaker 3>off the target of the tape.</v>

1264
01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:47.573
<v Speaker 3>Bang it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They looked at Colorado's thing and </v>

1265
01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:50.324
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

1266
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:53.020
<v Speaker 3>we'll cover that with steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Were coming in with H,</v>

1267
01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:54.990
<v Speaker 3>forget what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to,</v>

1268
01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:59.410
<v Speaker 3>we're doing just to set shop now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't care if you've been in business</v>

1269
01:01:59.411 --> 01:02:03.530
<v Speaker 3>with nothing just to set up shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got to get a piece of the actual okay</v>

1270
01:02:04.210 --> 01:02:05.540
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they just,</v>

1271
01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.613
<v Speaker 3>they work deals out with banks and made </v>
<v Speaker 3>it easy and acceptable for these guys </v>

1272
01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:12.410
<v Speaker 3>could put them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's right.</v>

1273
01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of places it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were dealing in cash.</v>

1274
01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:15.973
<v Speaker 3>They hired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in Colorado in the early </v>

1275
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:18.350
<v Speaker 3>days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had a higher,</v>

1276
01:02:18.351 --> 01:02:21.990
<v Speaker 3>a lot of like Spec ops guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love saying in Spec ops like,</v>

1277
01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:24.450
<v Speaker 3>I know what the fuck I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just sounds cool.</v>

1278
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.823
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would hire like former seals and </v>

1279
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:29.520
<v Speaker 3>shit and then they would have to carry </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1280
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.240
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1282
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:35.603
<v Speaker 3>So it made it very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They weren't allowing them to use banks </v>

1283
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.020
<v Speaker 3>or credit cards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather,</v>

1284
01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:42.150
<v Speaker 3>they weren't allowing them to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1287
01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:51.210
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] the hot store when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>turned me on to my license,</v>

1288
01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:54.170
<v Speaker 3>the hot store at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which they're not there.</v>

1289
01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.073
<v Speaker 3>Know that dude at the height of it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking out of there everyday with 25 </v>

1290
01:03:00.391 --> 01:03:02.880
<v Speaker 3>gram by himself and cool life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

1291
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:04.410
<v Speaker 3>that's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>

1292
01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:05.244
<v Speaker 3>but you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just dumb as fuck when the dea </v>

1293
01:03:06.931 --> 01:03:07.764
<v Speaker 3>came in to have that cash in the safe </v>
<v Speaker 3>right there that they just swooped on </v>

1294
01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.050
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew a guy who got shot.</v>

1295
01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:14.243
<v Speaker 3>He was a really nice guy and he used to </v>
<v Speaker 3>work at the Inglewood wellness center </v>

1296
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 3>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was the early days of,</v>

1297
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:22.440
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the medical legalization.</v>

1298
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:26.260
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it's like somewhere around</v>

1299
01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:28.020
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] 99,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere,</v>

1300
01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.790
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in that range.</v>
<v Speaker 3>2099.</v>

1301
01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.043
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1302
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.033
<v Speaker 3>he apparently was coming out with a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>bag of cash and someone shot him right </v>

1303
01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:36.710
<v Speaker 3>in the stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>took his money.</v>

1304
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.060
<v Speaker 3>They didn't take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I took all the cash.</v>

1305
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:41.380
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing to hire people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had a higher piece.</v>

1306
01:03:41.381 --> 01:03:42.870
<v Speaker 3>You've got to hire people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1307
01:03:42.871 --> 01:03:46.320
<v Speaker 3>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see amateur mistakes.</v>

1308
01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:47.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw this Jamie.</v>

1309
01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.660
<v Speaker 3>I see amateur mistakes constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

1310
01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:54.000
<v Speaker 3>the store I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lost.</v>

1311
01:03:54.001 --> 01:03:56.700
<v Speaker 3>He lost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan when you over,</v>

1312
01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:57.930
<v Speaker 3>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lost everything.</v>

1313
01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:03.330
<v Speaker 3>He would any weed he got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy was an exotic guy himself.</v>

1314
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:07.590
<v Speaker 3>Like he was head when you're ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you love when somebody brings you.</v>

1315
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 3>So he bought as much as he could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that expression I had.</v>

1316
01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:13.740
<v Speaker 3>He was a head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody uses that anymore.</v>

1317
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:16.500
<v Speaker 3>So what he would do is when you walked </v>
<v Speaker 3>into this place,</v>

1318
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:21.950
<v Speaker 3>he would have 60 weeds on the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he kept all his weed on the property.</v>

1319
01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.080
<v Speaker 3>When the feds came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like stealing.</v>

1320
01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.030
<v Speaker 3>He had everything there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything was there.</v>

1321
01:04:30.031 --> 01:04:30.864
<v Speaker 3>One in the open.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have an apartment and you </v>

1322
01:04:33.181 --> 01:04:36.270
<v Speaker 3>have to have an amount on the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six ounces.</v>

1323
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:37.583
<v Speaker 3>It's all you should have one week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Jamie comes in and he wants eight </v>

1324
01:04:40.741 --> 01:04:42.270
<v Speaker 3>ounces,</v>
<v Speaker 3>give me 10 minutes.</v>

1325
01:04:42.271 --> 01:04:43.104
<v Speaker 3>I got a pigeon that will bring it over </v>
<v Speaker 3>here and 5 million right across the </v>

1326
01:04:45.031 --> 01:04:46.980
<v Speaker 3>street.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then I got a little apartment,</v>

1327
01:04:46.981 --> 01:04:49.710
<v Speaker 3>which a stash that you have a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>saves.</v>

1328
01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:51.053
<v Speaker 3>You have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the cops ain't going to let you </v>

1329
01:04:51.991 --> 01:04:54.300
<v Speaker 3>deposit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've gotta be fucking creative.</v>

1330
01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.870
<v Speaker 3>If you read all these guys' stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hardest,</v>

1331
01:04:57.871 --> 01:04:59.540
<v Speaker 3>the Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ready for this expression?</v>

1332
01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:05.480
<v Speaker 3>The hardest thing is what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll call him dick about that problem.</v>

1333
01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:07.850
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rowe in Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

1334
01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1335
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:11.870
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about this room filled with her.</v>

1336
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:12.930

1342
01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:18.010

1343
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.023

<v Speaker 2>you've got to give them the benefit of </v>

1344
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:21.214
<v Speaker 2>the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

01:06:40.001 --> 01:06:42.340
<v Speaker 2>that set the bird a message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a deal.</v>

1372
01:06:42.341 --> 01:06:43.870
<v Speaker 2>We're bearing can seals could land </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1373
01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:44.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it wasn't,</v>

1374
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:46.750
<v Speaker 2>part of the thing was with the people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

1375
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.080
<v Speaker 2>the ground that was in mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem.</v>

1376
01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:55.190
<v Speaker 2>This is where Eddie Bravo comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were landing in those everglades,</v>

1377
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:56.350
<v Speaker 2>no quote me on this.</v>

1378
01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he broke it down for me and somebody</v>

1379
01:06:58.271 --> 01:06:58.981
<v Speaker 2>else broke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken down,</v>

1380
01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:03.981
<v Speaker 2>made it be honest with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were allowing that on your boys</v>

1381
01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:05.820
<v Speaker 2>clock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton clock.</v>

1382
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:06.830
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1383
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:09.060
<v Speaker 2>that's like theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

1384
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.690
<v Speaker 2>That's what you always be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His drops out,</v>

1385
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.300
<v Speaker 2>right about truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the truth is fascinating.</v>

1386
01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:16.660
<v Speaker 2>The truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his two boys were murdered and uh,</v>

1387
01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:17.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1388
01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:21.890
<v Speaker 2>car near the official report they gave </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the parents was a,</v>

1389
01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:24.250
<v Speaker 2>that they had fallen asleep on the train</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracks.</v>

1390
01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:25.563
<v Speaker 2>So a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the parents pay for some sort of an </v>

1391
01:07:27.431 --> 01:07:31.960
<v Speaker 2>autopsy and it's revealed that the kid </v>
<v Speaker 2>had been stabbed.</v>

1392
01:07:31.961 --> 01:07:36.961
<v Speaker 2>And the one of them had been stabbed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they find out that around that same</v>

1393
01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 2>area was where those guys would drop </v>
<v Speaker 2>their drugs before they landed.</v>

1394
01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.010
<v Speaker 2>They would parachute down their drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>

1395
01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.840
<v Speaker 2>they would like and they would land.</v>

1396
01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:49.480
<v Speaker 2>And these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had dropped points where they would</v>

1397
01:07:49.481 --> 01:07:50.314
<v Speaker 2>put their shit and then someone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>would come by and pick it up on the </v>

1398
01:07:51.851 --> 01:07:52.684
<v Speaker 2>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got coordinators and these kids </v>

1399
01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:57.340
<v Speaker 2>apparently saw something they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to see.</v>

1400
01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:59.680
<v Speaker 2>So they fucking murdered these kids with</v>
<v Speaker 2>knives.</v>

1401
01:07:59.681 --> 01:08:00.514
<v Speaker 2>And then the coroner was all in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had to conduct some sort of </v>

1402
01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:04.084
<v Speaker 2>independent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is what got this whole barry </v>

1403
01:08:06.341 --> 01:08:07.174
<v Speaker 2>seal's thing going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this lady trying to figure out </v>

1404
01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:11.740
<v Speaker 2>this parents trying to figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to their kids.</v>

1405
01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe wrote a fucking crazy story.</v>

1406
01:08:13.671 --> 01:08:16.160
<v Speaker 2>You have to imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay that these</v>

1407
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.950
<v Speaker 1>guys were getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1408
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.800
<v Speaker 1>let's just draw a number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1409
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:23.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm just an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's just draw a number.</v>

1410
01:08:23.821 --> 01:08:27.740
<v Speaker 1>And they were probably getting $4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>per kilo.</v>

1411
01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:29.173
<v Speaker 1>What would they put on those planes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was sending five of those </v>

1412
01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>planes over a day and dropping them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Louisiana,</v>

1413
01:08:36.681 --> 01:08:38.340
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>

1414

<v Speaker 1>podcast and 83 they found the bear dead </v>

1415
01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>next to a Duffel bag filled with cocaine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aspen,</v>

1416
01:08:47.571 --> 01:08:48.404
<v Speaker 1>Colorado in the mountains because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would drop into fucking coke in the </v>

1417
01:08:52.071 --> 01:08:54.280
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very bad way.</v>

1418
01:08:54.281 --> 01:08:56.170
<v Speaker 1>The coke and he fucking old deed is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

1419
01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it say?</v>

1420

<v Speaker 4>load 1200 kilos of cocaine onto a seat,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's a plane.</v>

1425
01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:11.613

<v Speaker 1>There's no good side to Pablo Escobar </v>

1439
01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:42.044
<v Speaker 1>and the Saint Lee Harvey Weinstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a story that we have never </v>

1440
01:09:46.101 --> 01:09:48.650
<v Speaker 1>brought up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to assume.</v>

1441
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1442
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:51.283
<v Speaker 1>you see all these shows and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing and they were in bed for </v>

1443
01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:57.350
<v Speaker 1>sure with Nicaragua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Who else is in bed with Nicaragua?</v>

1445
01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.793
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that it is the actual CIA </v>

1446
01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:07.860
<v Speaker 4>or is it people or if it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it was,</v>

1447
01:10:07.861 --> 01:10:10.260
<v Speaker 4>let's not even say cia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dea.</v>

1448
01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:12.630
<v Speaker 4>FBI named a bunch of fucking letters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put them together.</v>

1449
01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:13.873
<v Speaker 4>Is it the actual organization?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whichever one it is that's bringing it </v>

1450
01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:18.714
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they complicit or are they're just </v>

1451
01:10:21.151 --> 01:10:21.984
<v Speaker 4>cowboys?</v>
<v Speaker 4>See the theory's always been that </v>

1452
01:10:23.671 --> 01:10:26.640
<v Speaker 4>there's been these few cowboys corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys.</v>

1453
01:10:26.641 --> 01:10:30.930
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they get too close to drug deals </v>
<v Speaker 4>to crow close to the drug deal,</v>

1454
01:10:30.931 --> 01:10:32.830
<v Speaker 4>and then sometimes they get seduced </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1455
01:10:32.850 --> 01:10:33.683
<v Speaker 4>cause there's a many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many stories of under oh under cover </v>

1456
01:10:35.011 --> 01:10:35.844
<v Speaker 4>cops getting seduced by the actual </v>
<v Speaker 4>lifestyle of being a criminal young </v>

1457
01:10:38.371 --> 01:10:39.204
<v Speaker 4>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably did a little crime </v>

1458
01:10:39.451 --> 01:10:40.284
<v Speaker 4>themselves here or there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They see some cops doing some dirty </v>

1459
01:10:42.211 --> 01:10:43.140
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They see him.</v>

1460
01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:43.974
<v Speaker 4>Some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1461
01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.580
<v Speaker 4>there was a thing that came out about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was it Baltimore?</v>

1462
01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:47.001
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1463
01:10:47.001 --> 01:10:49.440
<v Speaker 4>What does the city where cops had came </v>
<v Speaker 4>out and trial,</v>

1464
01:10:49.441 --> 01:10:53.330
<v Speaker 4>they'd kept toy guns on them to plant at</v>
<v Speaker 4>the scene of a,</v>

1465
01:10:53.331 --> 01:10:54.840
<v Speaker 4>of a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if they just</v>

1466
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:56.083
<v Speaker 1>shoots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fucking toy gun in the big </v>

1467
01:10:58.261 --> 01:10:59.094
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big world picture as an intelligent </v>

1468
01:11:00.931 --> 01:11:04.380
<v Speaker 1>individual as you are the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was planned in the sample.</v>

1469
01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 1>The CIA wanted a piece of their action </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the dea was tricked into going down.</v>

1470
01:11:11.791 --> 01:11:14.790
<v Speaker 1>That I really control a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be this,</v>

1471
01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:18.270
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not saying you as an American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be this dump.</v>

1472
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:19.143
<v Speaker 1>So all the research that we've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the research that we've done with </v>

1473
01:11:22.681 --> 01:11:23.514
<v Speaker 1>general north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was in on the package with barry </v>

<v Speaker 1>the whole fucking thing.</v>

1475
01:11:27.481 --> 01:11:30.860
<v Speaker 1>And here's what it gets even deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about the deep disturb that,</v>

1476
01:11:30.861 --> 01:11:34.380
<v Speaker 1>that nobody ever even looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have to think of,</v>

1477
01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:36.630
<v Speaker 1>because I heard this story a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

1478

<v Speaker 1>Columbia and everything and all these TV</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

1483
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.433

<v Speaker 1>he was on an island snorting coke with </v>

1484
01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:52.974
<v Speaker 1>long hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking like Jim Morrison and having </v>

01:15:45.311 --> 01:15:46.300
<v Speaker 1>blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1556
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.590
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't an easy thing for to them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1557
01:15:50.591 --> 01:15:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Battista was really fucking the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had really divided the country.</v>

1558
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:57.790
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what racism was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tow.</v>

1559
01:15:57.791 --> 01:15:58.624
<v Speaker 1>You were in Cuban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1955 black people weren't allowed in </v>

1560
01:16:01.691 --> 01:16:03.700
<v Speaker 1>casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea.</v>

1561
01:16:03.701 --> 01:16:06.270

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.850
<v Speaker 1>you have no idea what black rights were </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Cuba for those black fucking people.</v>

1563
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.490
<v Speaker 1>They got no rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those people were poor.</v>

1564
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:17.410
<v Speaker 1>That was such a high level of dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see all these people dancing,</v>

1565
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:20.740
<v Speaker 1>but on the other side there was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>famine,</v>

1566
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:24.370
<v Speaker 1>like people were fucking dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they wanted a change.</v>

1567
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Fidel came in there as a hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1568
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.863
<v Speaker 1>he came in as Cuba was going to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then he switched it on him and he </v>

1569
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:35.230
<v Speaker 1>aligned but Russia and he became a </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist.</v>

1570
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:39.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what made it worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what made it worse.</v>

1571
01:16:39.850 --> 01:16:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Racism and hunger has always existed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

1572
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:44.763
<v Speaker 1>It did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the problem that they always </v>

1573
01:16:47.021 --> 01:16:47.854
<v Speaker 1>showed that party side of Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that other side of the island is </v>

1574
01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.450
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is people starving.</v>

1575
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>production?</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1578
01:17:00.611 --> 01:17:03.430
<v Speaker 1>I was still thinking of that Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now all of that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1581
01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 1>some people are complaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people</v>

<v Speaker 2>you could definitely get some fakes </v>

1584
01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.640
<v Speaker 2>because now they're talking about how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the soil isn't rich.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it was interesting.</v>

1613
01:18:35.090 --> 01:18:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I got one time from San Francisco to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Reno,</v>

1614
01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:38.833
<v Speaker 1>one time from San Francisco to reno dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cops were looking for me and San </v>

<v Speaker 1>Francisco and you go down to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of those tourists districts and they</v>

<v Speaker 1>reno.</v>

1617
01:18:48.051 --> 01:18:48.884
<v Speaker 1>So I just jumped on the bus to reno at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this check and this is 1985 when we're </v>

1618
01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:56.000
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the bus and there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian k,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1620
01:18:58.581 --> 01:19:00.110
<v Speaker 1>you could smoke on the bus in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

1621
01:19:00.111 --> 01:19:00.944
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had rolled a blunt with hash and </v>

1622
01:19:08.391 --> 01:19:12.350
<v Speaker 1>tobacco when it got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had never done that before guys.</v>

1623
01:19:12.351 --> 01:19:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never even,</v>

1624
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I took two hits of that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dog.</v>

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:19.850
<v Speaker 1>I had a puke in that bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got high as fuck.</v>

1626
01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.610
<v Speaker 1>But that combination together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that tobacco,</v>

1627
01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.020
<v Speaker 1>this we'd hash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the real,</v>

1628
01:19:27.650 --> 01:19:28.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's too much.</v>

1629
01:19:28.761 --> 01:19:31.880
<v Speaker 2>Rockwell Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a bit much for Uncle Joey.</v>

1630
01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:36.200
<v Speaker 2>The first time I ever smoked a spliff </v>
<v Speaker 2>was with Charlie Murphy.</v>

1631
01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:39.260
<v Speaker 2>Charlie Murphy rolled them is his cousin</v>
<v Speaker 2>Richard.</v>

1632
01:19:39.261 --> 01:19:41.270
<v Speaker 2>We're on two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charlie could role,</v>

1633
01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1634
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:45.740
<v Speaker 2>he would take a swisher sweets old </v>
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>

1635
01:19:45.741 --> 01:19:46.574
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of cigar paper and he would </v>

1636
01:19:48.411 --> 01:19:51.290
<v Speaker 2>turn it into a joint with the cigar </v>
<v Speaker 2>paper,</v>

1637
01:19:51.530 --> 01:19:53.630
<v Speaker 2>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you inhale weed,</v>

1638
01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.450
<v Speaker 2>you never really inhaled those cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1639
01:19:56.451 --> 01:19:59.110
<v Speaker 2>you could just kind of get them in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth and you taste it.</v>

1640
01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.880
<v Speaker 2>Then you blow it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you take a drag a weed,</v>

1641
01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:04.550
<v Speaker 2>you open your lungs up and fill your </v>
<v Speaker 2>lungs with the smoke.</v>

1642
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smokes too harsh for that.</v>

1643
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:08.120
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't smoke</v>

1644
01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.720
<v Speaker 3>like that for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most people don't.</v>

1645
01:20:10.230 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 3>But when you do it with pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

1646
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:13.703
<v Speaker 3>So you get this career easy blast of </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicotine and the carets e blast a weed </v>

1647
01:20:17.971 --> 01:20:19.530
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

1648
01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.950
<v Speaker 3>it's very different than just weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I smoked.</v>

1649
01:20:22.951 --> 01:20:24.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last night on the podcast,</v>

1650
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:26.870
<v Speaker 3>I took two hits off in front of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gave me one of those.</v>

1651
01:20:26.970 --> 01:20:29.130
<v Speaker 3>I like those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was pretty fucking scared.</v>

1652
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared of my life.</v>

1653
01:20:31.651 --> 01:20:34.110
<v Speaker 3>The ones with the cigarettes in them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm scared.</v>

1654
01:20:34.870 --> 01:20:35.750
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1655
01:20:35.751 --> 01:20:36.130
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1656
01:20:36.130 --> 01:20:37.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't want no smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1657
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not talking to cigarettes.</v>

1658
01:20:38.431 --> 01:20:41.490
<v Speaker 3>But the ones with cigarettes and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting little high.</v>

1659
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:42.631
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

1660
01:20:42.631 --> 01:20:44.700
<v Speaker 3>this is a new door to the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1661
01:20:44.701 --> 01:20:47.040
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what like smoking.</v>

1662
01:20:47.250 --> 01:20:48.083
<v Speaker 3>One of the hardest things I ever gave up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with smoking cigarettes after you smoke </v>

1663
01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:52.670
<v Speaker 3>a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1664
01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:54.053
<v Speaker 3>That is just pure brilliance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you hit a fucking joy and you'd </v>

1665
01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:05.460
<v Speaker 3>take a little sip of coffee and after </v>
<v Speaker 3>you smoke that through to you light up a</v>

1666
01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Marlboro some life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's life fucking changing bro.</v>

1667
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.170
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people love him after a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real good meal.</v>

1668
01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:13.621
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you a meal.</v>

1671
01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:18.923
<v Speaker 3>I meal a joint and then the cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then another cigarette and a cup of </v>

1672
01:21:23.341 --> 01:21:26.820
<v Speaker 3>coffee on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some dessert said another second.</v>

1673
01:21:26.821 --> 01:21:28.440
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no fucking idea.</v>

1674
01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Cigarette scare the shit out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pleased.</v>

1675
01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:32.850
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't smoke them.</v>

1676
01:21:32.851 --> 01:21:33.684
<v Speaker 3>My Tony's hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My blood pressure would be 2000 over 80 </v>

1677
01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:40.440
<v Speaker 3>Tony says he can quit it anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A little fella.</v>

1678
01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:43.270
<v Speaker 3>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was the best one on one?</v>

1679
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:48.370
<v Speaker 3>What I realized was two years ago I shot</v>
<v Speaker 3>something and I smoked that night.</v>

1680
01:21:48.670 --> 01:21:51.310
<v Speaker 3>I asked one of the camera guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me fucking get me a cigarette.</v>

1681
01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:52.633
<v Speaker 3>And that next morning was when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>realized how really fucking bad day are </v>

1682
01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:58.120
<v Speaker 3>you felt terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1683
01:21:58.140 --> 01:22:02.040
<v Speaker 3>how many of you have one to two </v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes to Marlboro Lights?</v>

1684
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:05.790
<v Speaker 3>And I was fine that night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did a comedy club and I was like,</v>

1685
01:22:05.791 --> 01:22:07.250
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we all,</v>

1686
01:22:07.251 --> 01:22:09.900
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to smoke the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1687
01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:10.734
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd never do it again after that night </v>

1688
01:22:12.031 --> 01:22:13.560
<v Speaker 3>in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never do it again.</v>

1689
01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.720
<v Speaker 3>I took one of Tony's ones before it </v>
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>

1690
01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.810
<v Speaker 3>Interesting cigarettes or interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>

1691
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:20.090
<v Speaker 3>it does a weird little thing to your </v>
<v Speaker 3>breasts.</v>

1692
01:22:20.091 --> 01:22:20.924
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's one of the reasons why I did </v>

1693
01:22:21.991 --> 01:22:25.310
<v Speaker 3>this because I read something about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>nootropics are talking about um,</v>

1694
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:27.870
<v Speaker 3>different vitamin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's good for brain function.</v>

1695
01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:29.850
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things they said that </v>
<v Speaker 3>nicotine,</v>

1696
01:22:29.851 --> 01:22:30.684
<v Speaker 3>nicotine is actually a nootropic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they found that some people under </v>

1697
01:22:34.801 --> 01:22:37.440
<v Speaker 3>the use of tobacco with the use of </v>
<v Speaker 3>tobacco,</v>

1698
01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.653
<v Speaker 3>they achieve like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an elevated state of like certain </v>

1699
01:22:42.931 --> 01:22:44.130
<v Speaker 3>functions of the brain.</v>

1700
01:22:44.370 --> 01:22:47.460
<v Speaker 3>Like it actually has some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>small measurable effect.</v>

1701
01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:49.920
<v Speaker 3>So it really does stimulate the way your</v>
<v Speaker 3>brain works.</v>

1702
01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it's different.</v>

1703
01:22:51.390 --> 01:22:52.980
<v Speaker 3>I have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a combination.</v>

1704
01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's for me.</v>

1705
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:56.370
<v Speaker 3>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

1706
01:22:56.371 --> 01:22:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't just enjoy right now you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>say goodbye itself,</v>

1707
01:22:59.130 --> 01:23:02.280
<v Speaker 3>but the cigarette with the weed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if that coffee was brewing hot right</v>

1708
01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:03.114
<v Speaker 3>now and it was maybe 60 degrees outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a little bit of wind and sunlight </v>

1709
01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:09.353
<v Speaker 3>will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know when you stand out in the sun </v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machida and you're just,</v>

2054
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:03.150
<v Speaker 1>you're just watching the girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2055
01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:06.060
<v Speaker 1>You try to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's always something that,</v>

2056
01:39:06.061 --> 01:39:09.540
<v Speaker 1>those events that you get back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car with your wife and go,</v>

2057
01:39:10.590 --> 01:39:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck was that about?</v>

2058
01:39:12.661 --> 01:39:14.470
<v Speaker 1>And then they'll break it down for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tami,</v>

2059
01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm lying to you at every fucking thing.</v>

2060
01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:17.543
<v Speaker 1>It's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about the people </v>

2061
01:39:18.571 --> 01:39:20.910
<v Speaker 1>believe in the earth that there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve.</v>

2062
01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:25.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm striving to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were telling that bit.</v>

2063
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what the fuck he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about.</v>

2064
01:39:26.690 --> 01:39:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who does he hang out with?</v>

2065
01:39:28.350 --> 01:39:29.900
<v Speaker 1>This is what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2066
01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:33.840
<v Speaker 1>with this poor bastard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now that I have a child that's five,</v>

2067
01:39:34.290 --> 01:39:37.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting up to see different people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>views that are my age.</v>

2068
01:39:37.620 --> 01:39:41.820
<v Speaker 1>And this lady came up to me and gave me </v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole here beat how the kid is 15 they</v>

2069
01:39:41.821 --> 01:39:46.821
<v Speaker 1>have my medication and he's known he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman since he was nine and that,</v>

2070
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:52.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then she fucked up Joe Rogan.</v>

2071
01:39:52.330 --> 01:39:54.060
<v Speaker 1>She said she always wanted a girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

2072
01:39:54.090 --> 01:39:57.420
<v Speaker 1>knowing Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you guys are talking about something</v>

2073
01:39:57.421 --> 01:40:00.600
<v Speaker 1>about there was of somebody or they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>got in trouble for a three year old,</v>

2074
01:40:00.630 --> 01:40:03.120
<v Speaker 1>give them block and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want nothing about that world.</v>

2075
01:40:03.380 --> 01:40:04.370
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2076
01:40:04.371 --> 01:40:05.760
<v Speaker 1>and Benjamin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got in trouble.</v>

2077
01:40:05.761 --> 01:40:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Get fired from his agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They dropped him because he was tweeting</v>

2078
01:40:09.241 --> 01:40:12.480
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of shit about someone using </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone blockers on a three year old.</v>

2079
01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.220
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

2080
01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:17.100
<v Speaker 1>What I listened to that day and where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

2081
01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I thought my head was gonna blow up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>her when she came over and explained why</v>

2082
01:40:21.811 --> 01:40:23.190
<v Speaker 1>he was going to be a trend again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2083
01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.510
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my thing.</v>

2084
01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Here's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If kids behaving a certain way,</v>

2085
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.903
<v Speaker 1>let him keep behaving that way you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fucking throw hormones in the </v>

2086
01:40:32.521 --> 01:40:33.354
<v Speaker 1>mix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what's going to </v>

2087
01:40:33.571 --> 01:40:36.390
<v Speaker 1>happen when you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to change who he is.</v>

2088
01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:37.433
<v Speaker 1>So you're telling me that he has this </v>
<v Speaker 1>urge to take hormones that are not </v>

2089
01:40:40.291 --> 01:40:42.960
<v Speaker 1>native in his body and the same amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's this urge to do this,</v>

2090
01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.520
<v Speaker 1>so we should just let them do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2091
01:40:44.521 --> 01:40:47.700
<v Speaker 1>he has an urge to be identified as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

2092
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even have to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

2093
01:40:51.210 --> 01:40:53.500
<v Speaker 1>If you just decide you identify as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>

2094
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.540
<v Speaker 4>most people are going to be cool with </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2095
01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:56.553
<v Speaker 4>Like we're saying that a child has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take some chemicals in the middle of </v>

2096
01:41:00.341 --> 01:41:02.620
<v Speaker 4>their developmental cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the only way we can do this.</v>

2097
01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:03.513
<v Speaker 4>This is the smart way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a smart way when they're six or </v>

2098
01:41:05.651 --> 01:41:08.230
<v Speaker 4>16 or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>

2099
01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:11.050
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From a developmental standpoint,</v>

2100
01:41:11.051 --> 01:41:15.100
<v Speaker 4>like I'm not a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I understand enough about the stages</v>

2101
01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:15.934
<v Speaker 4>that the human being goes through before</v>
<v Speaker 4>it reaches adulthood and you're not </v>

2102
01:41:18.881 --> 01:41:19.714
<v Speaker 4>really completely formed until you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like 20 years old or 25 years old or </v>

2103
01:41:22.721 --> 01:41:25.720
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the frontal Cortex does inform</v>

2104
01:41:25.721 --> 01:41:28.390
<v Speaker 4>to your 25 so your decision making is </v>
<v Speaker 4>always a little weird.</v>

2105
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.710
<v Speaker 4>So you don't have $12 what the fuck they</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to be at Fifth Katelyn?</v>

2106
01:41:31.711 --> 01:41:36.490
<v Speaker 4>16 six or a three though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said that he knew it done.</v>

2107
01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.190
<v Speaker 4>Come on and I went home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told my wife,</v>

2108
01:41:39.191 --> 01:41:41.200
<v Speaker 4>my wife said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well you got to watch a show or be week.</v>

2109
01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:44.650
<v Speaker 4>Are they eight is a show about kids that</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to,</v>

2110
01:41:44.740 --> 01:41:46.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make the child listen.</v>

2111
01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.510
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just that I'm trying to,</v>

2112
01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:52.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to tell you that I'm finding </v>
<v Speaker 4>out about shit now though.</v>

2113
01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.221
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird.</v>

2114
01:41:54.221 --> 01:41:58.000
<v Speaker 4>It's like why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why does if someone feels a certain way,</v>

2115
01:41:58.001 --> 01:41:58.834
<v Speaker 4>they feel they are a certain way and why</v>
<v Speaker 4>did they have to take chemicals to </v>

2116
01:42:01.271 --> 01:42:03.550
<v Speaker 4>achieve a new state?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

2117
01:42:03.551 --> 01:42:04.384
<v Speaker 4>What is like the identify with being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>woman so they have to take chemicals to </v>

2118
01:42:08.021 --> 01:42:11.470
<v Speaker 4>reach this state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think man,</v>

2119
01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:15.640
<v Speaker 4>if I was a person who was a transgender </v>
<v Speaker 4>person listened to me talk,</v>

2120
01:42:15.641 --> 01:42:17.080
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck up.</v>

2121
01:42:17.081 --> 01:42:17.914
<v Speaker 4>You don't know shit about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of you cheered if you're </v>

2122
01:42:20.141 --> 01:42:20.974
<v Speaker 4>listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that all I'm saying is that this is </v>

2123
01:42:23.501 --> 01:42:25.360
<v Speaker 4>a very unusual situation.</v>

2124
01:42:25.780 --> 01:42:28.780
<v Speaker 4>It's very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's a bad thing,</v>

2125
01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:29.973
<v Speaker 4>but I think that doing it to someone who</v>
<v Speaker 4>really can't fully make up their mind </v>

2126
01:42:35.861 --> 01:42:36.694
<v Speaker 4>yet just seems insanely risky and what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what could happen to the kid could be </v>

2127
01:42:43.481 --> 01:42:44.314
<v Speaker 4>terrible and people have made successful</v>
<v Speaker 4>transitions when they'd transitioned in </v>

2128
01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.094
<v Speaker 4>their thirties you don't have to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you're six if you want to be a </v>

2129
01:42:50.411 --> 01:42:53.290
<v Speaker 4>transgender person and union thirties </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2130
01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:57.190
<v Speaker 4>Where your 20s or whenever we decide </v>
<v Speaker 4>that a human being is rationally capable</v>

2131
01:42:57.191 --> 01:43:00.890
<v Speaker 4>of making full life decisions that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>as dramatic that that's what I thought.</v>

2132
01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:02.073
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck makes a good decision at </v>

2133
01:43:03.230 --> 01:43:03.991
<v Speaker 4>six days?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2134
01:43:03.991 --> 01:43:04.824
<v Speaker 4>but it does matter what he want a 25 </v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't mean that someone had 16 </v>

2135
01:43:07.901 --> 01:43:11.350
<v Speaker 4>who thinks they're a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't absolutely become one later and</v>

2136
01:43:11.351 --> 01:43:12.730
<v Speaker 4>be super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super happy with it.</v>

2137
01:43:12.730 --> 01:43:13.563
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that's not possible </v>

2138
01:43:14.201 --> 01:43:15.850
<v Speaker 4>either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everything's possible.</v>

2139
01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:19.840
<v Speaker 4>There's a thing for everybody and if </v>
<v Speaker 4>that is what you feel like is your,</v>

2140
01:43:19.890 --> 01:43:21.700
<v Speaker 4>your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to be that.</v>

2141
01:43:21.701 --> 01:43:25.430
<v Speaker 4>That's just your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's who you identify with and you,</v>

2142
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:27.670
<v Speaker 4>you have every right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have every right to do that.</v>

2143
01:43:27.730 --> 01:43:30.280
<v Speaker 4>So what you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably you know how many fucking drugs</v>

2144
01:43:30.281 --> 01:43:35.281
<v Speaker 4>I did between 16 and 20 a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not funny.</v>

2145
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.520
<v Speaker 4>You did a lot of drugs from the time I </v>
<v Speaker 4>met you.</v>

2146
01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:43.300
<v Speaker 4>You were the fact that you had a heavier</v>
<v Speaker 4>schedule before that.</v>

2147
01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:45.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm talking about like I,</v>

2148
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:48.400
<v Speaker 4>I tried to stay away like I was a karate</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

2149
01:43:48.401 --> 01:43:52.190
<v Speaker 4>Like you and the kids from karate on </v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturdays.</v>

2150
01:43:52.190 --> 01:43:53.023
<v Speaker 3>They were geeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We either went to a martial art </v>

2151
01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.630
<v Speaker 3>festival,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we competed or we went to a karate movie</v>

2152
01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:03.700
<v Speaker 3>or we went to a Honda martial arts </v>
<v Speaker 3>supply.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2165
01:44:34.911 --> 01:44:39.740

<v Speaker 3>they all had this side.</v>

2169
01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:48.693
<v Speaker 3>You would buy the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the handle that I would hold the ones </v>

2170
01:44:51.481 --> 01:44:52.314
<v Speaker 3>where you wouldn't take one dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they had the water at the top and they </v>

2171
01:44:55.061 --> 01:44:55.894
<v Speaker 3>had for riches of canvas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you would stand in front of it and </v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then we would save our money.</v>

2175
01:45:06.081 --> 01:45:06.914
<v Speaker 3>We would geeks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what we did at 12 but to had a </v>

2176
01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:10.514
<v Speaker 3>little Goombas and my neighborhood and </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they were 12 they did something </v>

2177
01:45:13.611 --> 01:45:14.444
<v Speaker 3>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They went behind the school and they </v>

2178
01:45:16.461 --> 01:45:19.820
<v Speaker 3>would row one joy and put it in a piece </v>
<v Speaker 3>of glass tube and,</v>

2179
01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:23.480
<v Speaker 3>and light it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we would drink a boone's farm.</v>

2180
01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fruit shit.</v>

2181
01:45:25.011 --> 01:45:27.830
<v Speaker 3>And I'd get pukey so I didn't know who </v>
<v Speaker 3>to hang out with.</v>

2182
01:45:27.831 --> 01:45:29.650
<v Speaker 3>So I would have to be like a double a </v>
<v Speaker 3>check.</v>

2183
01:45:30.110 --> 01:45:32.150
<v Speaker 3>That was a tough job for me as a 12 year</v>
<v Speaker 3>old.</v>

2184
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:35.030
<v Speaker 3>I liked hanging out with my karate </v>
<v Speaker 3>geeks.</v>

2185
01:45:35.031 --> 01:45:37.670
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like going to competitions.</v>

2186
01:45:37.671 --> 01:45:38.504
<v Speaker 3>I like doing forms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like doing the semi contact </v>

2187
01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.940
<v Speaker 3>competitions where you couldn't kick </v>
<v Speaker 3>above the head.</v>

2188
01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those are good for kids,</v>

2189
01:45:45.231 --> 01:45:46.064
<v Speaker 3>but you don't like it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you still kick the kid and get </v>

2190
01:45:47.481 --> 01:45:49.110
<v Speaker 3>disqualified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But fuck fucking.</v>

2191
01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:50.600
<v Speaker 3>I think the joy of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just seeing,</v>

2192
01:45:50.601 --> 01:45:51.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people did that.</v>

2193
01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.393
<v Speaker 3>This is when life was simple for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was so I had to make a decision </v>

2194
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:57.710
<v Speaker 3>because the Kung Fu kids didn't get no </v>
<v Speaker 3>pussy.</v>

2195
01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:02.240
<v Speaker 3>They just weren't into policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would talk about girls and they may</v>

2196
01:46:02.241 --> 01:46:04.880
<v Speaker 3>be had a crush on the girl and the four </v>
<v Speaker 3>30 class,</v>

2197
01:46:05.210 --> 01:46:07.370
<v Speaker 3>but they never asked to accompany of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>

2198
01:46:07.760 --> 01:46:08.593
<v Speaker 3>My other buddies went to pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so eventually I cut the karate fucking </v>

2199
01:46:12.201 --> 01:46:15.120
<v Speaker 3>geeks out and I started hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>

2200
01:46:15.121 --> 01:46:15.954
<v Speaker 3>the druggies and you make your </v>
<v Speaker 3>transition into and from those </v>

2201
01:46:19.521 --> 01:46:23.690
<v Speaker 3>developmental ages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I tried to hide my drug use.</v>

2202
01:46:23.691 --> 01:46:27.350
<v Speaker 3>I tried to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with marijuana use for two or</v>

2203
01:46:27.351 --> 01:46:28.970
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just marijuana.</v>

2204
01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:33.710
<v Speaker 3>While then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once I became a freshman,</v>

2205
01:46:34.370 --> 01:46:35.203
<v Speaker 3>got it and start basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My freshman year I decided to let's </v>

2206
01:46:38.541 --> 01:46:43.541
<v Speaker 3>venture out into this acid thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's venture into this masculine thing.</v>

2207
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:47.590
<v Speaker 3>It was a different name.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was masculine,</v>

2208
01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.560
<v Speaker 3>but it really wasn't mescal and Joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogan.</v>

2209
01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 3>It</v>

2210
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:51.420
<v Speaker 1>was a little tag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cody,</v>

2211
01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:53.290
<v Speaker 1>it would know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even pay on it.</v>

2212
01:46:53.291 --> 01:46:56.130
<v Speaker 1>It was a little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the same shoes.</v>

2213
01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:56.993
<v Speaker 1>Me Isn't Paoli Mba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but masculine is what they saw you in </v>

2214
01:47:01.321 --> 01:47:02.154
<v Speaker 1>the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They supposedly put in Tequila as </v>

2215
01:47:04.081 --> 01:47:05.910
<v Speaker 1>something that's a sow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2216
01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:06.773
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that two little </v>

2217
01:47:07.531 --> 01:47:10.820
<v Speaker 1>fucking white kids made in a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was rat poison,</v>

2218
01:47:10.821 --> 01:47:14.430
<v Speaker 1>but something else and something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was very tiny.</v>

2219
01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:17.700
<v Speaker 1>It was maybe a little size of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

2220
01:47:17.701 --> 01:47:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And it came in aluminum foil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even smaller than that.</v>

2221
01:47:21.090 --> 01:47:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even smaller than that,</v>

2222
01:47:23.220 --> 01:47:26.700
<v Speaker 1>way smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of thing that that's it.</v>

2223
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:28.013
<v Speaker 1>You paid $80 for it and you got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred of those and you're struggling </v>

2224
01:47:31.561 --> 01:47:32.394
<v Speaker 1>for $3 a piece and that would fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 1>up for six hours with a two hour hayes </v>

2225
01:47:38.100 --> 01:47:38.933
<v Speaker 1>in between an hour buffer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to come down and I did that for </v>

2226
01:47:43.591 --> 01:47:44.520
<v Speaker 1>three or four months.</v>

2227
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Then they introduced me to thc crystal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is snorting.</v>

2228
01:47:49.290 --> 01:47:50.123
<v Speaker 1>They sold it as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do is we got a bunch of stems </v>

2229
01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:54.174
<v Speaker 1>and seeds from the reefer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put it in a pot and we boil that pot </v>

2230
01:47:59.250 --> 01:48:04.250
<v Speaker 1>and whatever separate from the stems and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seeds that goes to the sides.</v>

2231
01:48:04.261 --> 01:48:07.680
<v Speaker 1>We scraped that off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where you snot in your nose.</v>

2232
01:48:07.770 --> 01:48:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was,</v>

2233
01:48:10.140 --> 01:48:10.973
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had like a personal karate rule cause </v>

2234
01:48:14.041 --> 01:48:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I would always just smoke it and do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>

2235
01:48:16.771 --> 01:48:18.870
<v Speaker 1>but I was never going to put nothing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my nose.</v>

2236
01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.101
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a rule?</v>

2237
01:48:20.101 --> 01:48:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Like a drug addict puts something in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their nose.</v>

2238
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a complete different range.</v>

2239
01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:29.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll never shoot heroin and I never was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially at my karate man as a carotid</v>

2240

<v Speaker 1>It was angel dust.</v>

2244
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:45.360
<v Speaker 1>They just told you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went under the Angel Dust Tab.</v>

01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:39.250
<v Speaker 2>It's even looking it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the German brewery.</v>

2277
01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Liars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liars.</v>

2278
01:50:42.281 --> 01:50:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Liars line about American American made.</v>

2279
01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:46.293
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they make a lot of American </v>
<v Speaker 2>American plants make a lot of cars now </v>

2280
01:50:49.961 --> 01:50:53.740
<v Speaker 2>that you think are Japanese cars like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Toyota Tundras.</v>

2281
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:56.620
<v Speaker 2>They make them in Texas can make a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them in Ohio too.</v>

2282
01:50:57.090 --> 01:50:58.660
<v Speaker 2>Honda's Nissan's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's weird,</v>

2283
01:50:58.661 --> 01:51:00.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you think you'd buy in a Honda,</v>

2284
01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:03.040
<v Speaker 2>you sink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're definitely buying a Japanese car.</v>

2285
01:51:03.250 --> 01:51:05.950
<v Speaker 2>If you think you're buying some American</v>
<v Speaker 2>cars,</v>

2286
01:51:05.951 --> 01:51:08.110
<v Speaker 2>it might be a Mexican car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How crazy is that?</v>

2287
01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Like what companies making their cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>down in Mexico?</v>

2288
01:51:12.190 --> 01:51:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I think they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they closed a couple of plants.</v>

2289
01:51:14.471 --> 01:51:17.230
<v Speaker 2>I think Toyota was down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody else for a while.</v>

2290
01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:19.570
<v Speaker 2>But here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they put him down in Mexico,</v>

2291
01:51:19.571 --> 01:51:24.550
<v Speaker 2>but they gave him American money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the levels of American money that's</v>

2292
01:51:25.150 --> 01:51:28.800
<v Speaker 2>in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would stop doing it a lot actually.</v>

2293
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:30.340
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at all these different ones.</v>

2294
01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Chrysler has three plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four to three plans.</v>

2295
01:51:32.771 --> 01:51:35.020
<v Speaker 2>GM is four plans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moms does one,</v>

2296
01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:37.210
<v Speaker 2>they do it down there cause it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaper,</v>

2297
01:51:37.211 --> 01:51:38.044
<v Speaker 2>which I guess they have to do what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>gotta do and I'm sure it helps the </v>

2298
01:51:41.321 --> 01:51:42.154
<v Speaker 2>community because then I know it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know people that have had </v>

2299
01:51:44.621 --> 01:51:47.890
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing down in these countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they do it for the cheap,</v>

2300
01:51:48.250 --> 01:51:51.100
<v Speaker 2>but it does help the people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's some places that don't have</v>

2301
01:51:51.101 --> 01:51:51.934
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's arguable is like why is </v>

2302
01:51:53.771 --> 01:51:54.604
<v Speaker 2>living like a western person so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important when these people have been </v>

2303
01:51:57.791 --> 01:52:00.880
<v Speaker 2>living in their own way for thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

2304
01:52:00.881 --> 01:52:01.714
<v Speaker 2>It's just they just didn't have like all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy infrastructure and all the </v>

2305
01:52:04.901 --> 01:52:07.150
<v Speaker 2>shit that we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have the crazy cities.</v>

2306
01:52:07.151 --> 01:52:10.810
<v Speaker 2>And you know other than a few cities in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico like Mexico City.</v>

2307
01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:15.160
<v Speaker 2>So they would go and put these plants </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like why is it doing,</v>

2308
01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:17.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm all for people being able to work.</v>

2309
01:52:17.980 --> 01:52:18.813
<v Speaker 2>But is that better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it better than the way they were </v>

2310
01:52:20.621 --> 01:52:21.454
<v Speaker 2>living before when they were living like</v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people are living like </v>

2311
01:52:23.921 --> 01:52:27.220
<v Speaker 2>villagers are living like trades people </v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever they did to get by.</v>

2312
01:52:27.670 --> 01:52:29.170
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it is better.</v>

2313
01:52:29.171 --> 01:52:30.004
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to the whole situation </v>

2314
01:52:31.841 --> 01:52:33.730
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still remember,</v>

2315
01:52:33.731 --> 01:52:34.564
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm a little older than us storm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember where it was kind of starting </v>

2316
01:52:37.181 --> 01:52:41.820
<v Speaker 2>to get that bull if you bought a foreign</v>
<v Speaker 2>car like I,</v>

2317
01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm bad old ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that that,</v>

2318
01:52:44.321 --> 01:52:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I still remember the La</v>

2319
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:47.023
<v Speaker 1>mid seventies I still remember when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Toyota advertised or Nissan advertised </v>

2320
01:52:51.981 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 1>the car for 1995 and I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second,</v>

2321
01:52:56.271 --> 01:52:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I got $40 in the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could buy one of those.</v>

2322
01:52:58.461 --> 01:53:02.630
<v Speaker 1>It was $1,900</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupid like a corolla or something.</v>

2323
01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:04.113
<v Speaker 1>And I still remember there was a time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country when if you bought of what </v>

2324
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:10.040
<v Speaker 1>if you were on the first person on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>block.</v>

2325
01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:13.850
<v Speaker 1>If you showed up with a foreign car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a little bit of grief,</v>

2326
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:15.763
<v Speaker 1>you got a little bit of grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it felt like they sold </v>

2327
01:53:19.881 --> 01:53:23.030
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt like we dropped the ball at some</v>

2328
01:53:23.031 --> 01:53:25.310
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Americans,</v>

2329
01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:26.173
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened to Detroit </v>

2330
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:29.263
<v Speaker 1>and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that where's the highest </v>

2331
01:53:30.921 --> 01:53:32.750
<v Speaker 1>populations of Puerto Rico in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>

2332
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:34.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think it's the bronx,</v>

2333
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:37.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a suburb outside of Cleveland.</v>

2334
01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:39.193
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in the 50s they took a bunch of </v>

2335
01:53:41.211 --> 01:53:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Ricans and put them into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>suburb to work at the car plants.</v>

2336
01:53:45.620 --> 01:53:46.453
<v Speaker 1>All the car plants shut down at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ended up going other places and </v>

2337
01:53:50.721 --> 01:53:51.860
<v Speaker 1>whatever and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2338
01:53:51.861 --> 01:53:52.760
<v Speaker 1>blah and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2339
01:53:52.761 --> 01:53:53.594
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the foreign car and started </v>

2340
01:53:55.021 --> 01:53:57.620
<v Speaker 1>checking our fucking ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why again?</v>

2341
01:53:57.650 --> 01:53:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it?</v>

2342
01:53:58.881 --> 01:54:01.220
<v Speaker 1>The workmanship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it the quality?</v>

2343
01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:03.860
<v Speaker 1>All I know is if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I got a fucking Toyota,</v>

2344
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:08.120
<v Speaker 1>I could drive it for 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles without stopping to get gas.</v>

2345
01:54:08.180 --> 01:54:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You as a consumer and as an American,</v>

2346
01:54:11.901 --> 01:54:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you want to buy American products and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to buy American made products,</v>

2347
01:54:16.910 --> 01:54:17.743
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple of places now like </v>

2348
01:54:20.300 --> 01:54:21.720
<v Speaker 1>beside Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2349
01:54:22.730 --> 01:54:24.650
<v Speaker 1>where are we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have places now,</v>

2350
01:54:24.651 --> 01:54:25.484
<v Speaker 1>like in Indiana we had like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Toyota has a couple of places and they </v>

2351
01:54:29.541 --> 01:54:31.190
<v Speaker 1>should bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2352
01:54:32.100 --> 01:54:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

2353
01:54:33.561 --> 01:54:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Let some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2354
01:54:34.401 --> 01:54:35.234
<v Speaker 1>so we trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get someone to tell you all of this </v>

2355
01:54:37.641 --> 01:54:38.660
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>

2356
01:54:39.110 --> 01:54:42.200
<v Speaker 1>what kind of car are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese or Chinese or Japanese?</v>

2357
01:54:42.201 --> 01:54:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Japanese and let some of our strict get </v>
<v Speaker 1>made over there as part of,</v>

2358
01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:47.563
<v Speaker 1>is it Nafta?</v>

2359
01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:49.590
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's North American,</v>

2360
01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:51.970
<v Speaker 4>North American free trade agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's just,</v>

2361
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:53.323
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm just talking about my </v>

2362
01:54:54.361 --> 01:54:55.530
<v Speaker 4>answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's just us.</v>

2363
01:54:55.531 --> 01:54:58.920
<v Speaker 4>Mexico and Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when we build a car in Mexico,</v>

2364
01:54:58.921 --> 01:55:01.590
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Develop that car because of the rate.</v>

2365
01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they pay,</v>

2366
01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.830
<v Speaker 4>people pay feel blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's cheaper to get land.</v>

2367
01:55:05.070 --> 01:55:08.280
<v Speaker 4>These people don't have anything else </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on down there or not as much going</v>

2368
01:55:08.281 --> 01:55:10.500
<v Speaker 4>on down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously as they do in America and some</v>

2369
01:55:10.501 --> 01:55:11.334
<v Speaker 4>like heavily populated cities and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>they can offer people much less money </v>

2370
01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:17.040
<v Speaker 4>and they do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of plants that do that,</v>

2371
01:55:17.850 --> 01:55:18.683
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the real question is do you think </v>

2372
01:55:20.671 --> 01:55:21.504
<v Speaker 4>that this is just going to elevate these</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and they're eventually going to </v>

2373
01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:25.313
<v Speaker 4>catch up with the Western world and live</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way that we're living right now in </v>

2374
01:55:28.441 --> 01:55:29.010
<v Speaker 4>the United States?</v>

2375
01:55:29.010 --> 01:55:32.340
<v Speaker 4>Like there's ultimately a possibility of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that or are we saying,</v>

2376
01:55:32.341 --> 01:55:33.174
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're always going to have these people </v>

2377
01:55:33.721 --> 01:55:34.554
<v Speaker 4>that would treat less good and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>just always going to keep them in that </v>

2378
01:55:36.601 --> 01:55:38.130
<v Speaker 4>position.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're never going to get any better.</v>

2379
01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:39.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2380
01:55:39.330 --> 01:55:42.750
<v Speaker 4>Which one is it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's either one of those two things or I</v>

2381
01:55:42.751 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 4>made it possibly be that people just </v>
<v Speaker 4>want shit cheaper,</v>

2382
01:55:46.651 --> 01:55:48.270
<v Speaker 4>so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't care.</v>

2383
01:55:48.480 --> 01:55:49.313
<v Speaker 4>They don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't care if a guy's making a </v>

2384
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:52.650
<v Speaker 4>dollar a week or whatever the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 4>make.</v>

2385
01:55:52.651 --> 01:55:54.510
<v Speaker 4>How much do they make?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had to guess,</v>

2386
01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:56.580
<v Speaker 4>if you guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much does someone in a um,</v>

2387
01:55:57.630 --> 01:55:58.463
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an automobile plant in Mexico make as </v>

2388
01:56:00.511 --> 01:56:01.344
<v Speaker 4>opposed to an American worker?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure someone must have done some </v>

2389
01:56:02.971 --> 01:56:03.804
<v Speaker 4>sort of a study.</v>

2390
01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:06.751
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2391
01:56:06.751 --> 01:56:09.210
<v Speaker 4>because if they were doing the exact </v>
<v Speaker 4>same thing on this patch of dirt,</v>

2392
01:56:09.211 --> 01:56:09.931
<v Speaker 4>we would go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2393
01:56:09.931 --> 01:56:12.360
<v Speaker 4>You can't pay that little?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you say,</v>

2394
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:13.081
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but down there,</v>

2395
01:56:13.081 --> 01:56:13.914
<v Speaker 4>everything's cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the given these people an </v>

2396
01:56:16.141 --> 01:56:18.900
<v Speaker 4>opportunity like why is it better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the question.</v>

2397
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Why is it better than the way they've </v>
<v Speaker 4>always been living in Mexico?</v>

2398
01:56:23.281 --> 01:56:28.281
<v Speaker 4>$2 per hour workers make $40,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>suv is $2 an hour.</v>

2399
01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:29.873
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ to imagine a person working</v>
<v Speaker 4>all day and you hand them $16 you sir </v>

2400
01:56:36.361 --> 01:56:37.194
<v Speaker 4>are a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine guy busts his ass on </v>

2401
01:56:41.581 --> 01:56:46.581
<v Speaker 4>an assembly line all day?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You give him $16 fuck you.</v>

2402
01:56:48.150 --> 01:56:50.520
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Started a dollar 10 an hour.</v>

2403
01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A dollar an hour.</v>

2404
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:57.030
<v Speaker 4>You make more than prison.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is ridiculous.</v>

2405
01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:59.220
<v Speaker 4>And that's Mexican money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's American money.</v>

2406
01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:00.890
<v Speaker 4>A dollar a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$2 and hour.</v>

2407
01:57:00.930 --> 01:57:04.330
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's like the translated joe would</v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

2408
01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.730
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's insane.</v>

2409
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:06.923
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just the idea is that if you're </v>

2410
01:57:10.261 --> 01:57:11.094
<v Speaker 4>always going to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to always be able to make more </v>

2411
01:57:13.051 --> 01:57:15.540
<v Speaker 4>money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like these people have this idea in,</v>

2412
01:57:15.541 --> 01:57:17.730
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these corporations have </v>
<v Speaker 4>unlimited growth.</v>

2413
01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.340
<v Speaker 4>They just want to constantly be growing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and growing and growing.</v>

2414
01:57:20.610 --> 01:57:21.443
<v Speaker 4>It's some people think it's a very </v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous idea because if you're your </v>

2415
01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:29.540
<v Speaker 4>bottom line for your companies to always</v>
<v Speaker 4>outdo every quarter at a certain time,</v>

2416
01:57:29.611 --> 01:57:30.444
<v Speaker 4>people start getting desperate and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>start cutting environmental corners or </v>

2417
01:57:34.141 --> 01:57:34.974
<v Speaker 4>cut and research corners.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're doing whatever the fuck they </v>

2418
01:57:36.391 --> 01:57:40.200
<v Speaker 4>have to do to keep their bottom line </v>
<v Speaker 4>down and keep their profits coming in.</v>

2419
01:57:40.201 --> 01:57:43.590
<v Speaker 4>And that's what you could say about like</v>
<v Speaker 4>these prescription drug companies,</v>

2420
01:57:43.591 --> 01:57:45.390
<v Speaker 4>people want to think that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies are evil.</v>

2421
01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:48.420
<v Speaker 4>They're companies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their job is to make money,</v>

2422
01:57:48.450 --> 01:57:49.283
<v Speaker 4>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're caught up in a storm where </v>

2423
01:57:50.831 --> 01:57:55.831
<v Speaker 4>they're allowed to make legal money and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this legal money is fucking substantial.</v>

2424
01:57:56.370 --> 01:57:57.203
<v Speaker 4>It's a giant amount of money these </v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical companies are making on </v>

2425
01:58:00.701 --> 01:58:02.820
<v Speaker 4>an opiate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so people are dying left and right.</v>

2426
01:58:02.821 --> 01:58:05.820
<v Speaker 4>Joey left and right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the craziest,</v>

2427
01:58:05.821 --> 01:58:10.560
<v Speaker 4>unspoken Emmett epidemics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The human race to a little bit forever.</v>

<v Speaker 2>packing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2531
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Cause at least I got to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I ever have an emergency,</v>

2535
02:02:59.301 --> 02:03:02.480
<v Speaker 2>when they told me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I knew when I was a kid,</v>

2536
02:03:02.481 --> 02:03:03.700
<v Speaker 2>I would go to central,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to Washington square park and I could </v>

<v Speaker 2>middle.</v>

2539
02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.910
<v Speaker 2>That's the real deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're going to fuck,</v>

2540
02:03:14.770 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 2>and they got a v in the middle of cut </v>

2543
02:03:28.460 --> 02:03:29.293
<v Speaker 2>Do you think if it was legal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more or less people to use it or the </v>

2544
02:03:32.061 --> 02:03:34.370
<v Speaker 2>same?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why are you,</v>

2545
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:36.770
<v Speaker 2>what is this trick points?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thursday?</v>

2546
02:03:36.771 --> 02:03:37.604
<v Speaker 2>I'm curious what you gambling and drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pills you give people the green </v>

2547
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:43.160
<v Speaker 2>greenlight dog.</v>

2548
02:03:43.160 --> 02:03:46.250
<v Speaker 2>We're fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're crap creatures of habit.</v>

2549
02:03:46.850 --> 02:03:50.630
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to fucking go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of us are going to control it.</v>

2550
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:51.703
<v Speaker 2>Listen to some people that get knee </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery and neck surgery like yourself </v>

2551
02:03:55.070 --> 02:03:55.903
<v Speaker 2>and you thrown away the Vicodin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's other people that take that </v>

2552
02:03:59.331 --> 02:04:02.480
<v Speaker 2>prescription and two years later they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting heroin.</v>

2553
02:04:02.780 --> 02:04:05.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that.</v>

2554
02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have different holes in our jeans,</v>

2555
02:04:09.741 --> 02:04:10.491
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2556
02:04:10.491 --> 02:04:12.920
<v Speaker 2>there's some people that like pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one of them,</v>

2557
02:04:12.921 --> 02:04:14.510
<v Speaker 2>but there's some people that genuinely </v>
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

2558
02:04:14.511 --> 02:04:16.670
<v Speaker 2>They get pleasure out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of pain do you like?</v>

2559
02:04:16.700 --> 02:04:17.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of pain?</v>

2560
02:04:17.511 --> 02:04:21.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the question.</v>

2561
02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:23.720
<v Speaker 2>I think they think there are syndromes </v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

2562
02:04:23.721 --> 02:04:25.940
<v Speaker 2>and it's probably fairly common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns,</v>

2563
02:04:25.941 --> 02:04:26.774
<v Speaker 2>it's not just one person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like several people that could </v>

2564
02:04:27.891 --> 02:04:31.100
<v Speaker 2>point out that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced actual like pleasure,</v>

2565
02:04:31.101 --> 02:04:34.220
<v Speaker 2>like a serotonin burst from certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of pain.</v>

2566
02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:36.530
<v Speaker 2>They don't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they feel it is the way we</v>

2567
02:04:36.531 --> 02:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're always trying to do</v>

2568
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:38.963
<v Speaker 3>things to themselves and they say that </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the people that get like a lot </v>

2569
02:04:40.561 --> 02:04:42.170
<v Speaker 3>of piercings have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2570
02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:44.100
<v Speaker 3>some people that get a lot of tattoos </v>
<v Speaker 3>have that.</v>

2571
02:04:44.101 --> 02:04:45.980
<v Speaker 3>They start to feel the want to feel it </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

2572
02:04:46.040 --> 02:04:49.080
<v Speaker 3>They want to burn it into themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an I.</v>

2573
02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:49.351
<v Speaker 3>Dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

2574
02:04:49.351 --> 02:04:50.184
<v Speaker 3>obviously not a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's apparently a pretty common </v>

2575
02:04:52.981 --> 02:04:55.840
<v Speaker 3>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another day I want to talk to you about,</v>

2576
02:04:55.850 --> 02:04:59.050
<v Speaker 3>I was the pub cash can believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have to say I'm not a psychiatry.</v>

2577

<v Speaker 3>I love to podcast where you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about cause I want to do,</v>

2578
02:05:02.881 --> 02:05:05.370
<v Speaker 3>to really tell you the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The podcast are,</v>

2579
02:05:05.371 --> 02:05:07.050
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that may be some,</v>

2580
02:05:07.051 --> 02:05:11.510
<v Speaker 3>the Jones John Jones actions were caused</v>
<v Speaker 3>by head injuries.</v>

2581
02:05:11.550 --> 02:05:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Could easily been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tell you not caused by,</v>

2582
02:05:14.010 --> 02:05:16.250
<v Speaker 3>not caused by cause he usually could be </v>
<v Speaker 3>a fact.</v>

2583
02:05:16.260 --> 02:05:17.010
<v Speaker 3>I got to tell you something.</v>

2584
02:05:17.010 --> 02:05:18.760
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2585
02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:19.921
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2586
02:05:19.921 --> 02:05:22.920
<v Speaker 3>let's go back to abuse from gambling or </v>
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>

2587
02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:26.850
<v Speaker 3>The mind with cocaine is a very tricky </v>
<v Speaker 3>mine.</v>

2588
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:28.980
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it takes a year off.</v>

2589
02:05:29.970 --> 02:05:33.410
<v Speaker 3>I'm just telling you this from </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience because I learned a lot about</v>

2590
02:05:33.411 --> 02:05:35.880
<v Speaker 3>new tropics from you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really know much about it,</v>

2591
02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:39.060
<v Speaker 3>but Roman [inaudible] sent me two of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>jugs.</v>

2592
02:05:39.061 --> 02:05:42.100
<v Speaker 3>It's the ship that neuro one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the orange juice.</v>

2593
02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:43.213
<v Speaker 3>But that's not shit that got me into </v>
<v Speaker 3>nootropics when I got off cocaine that </v>

2594
02:05:46.441 --> 02:05:51.330
<v Speaker 3>came in the mail and I really drank and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't tell nobody my secret because I</v>

2595
02:05:51.331 --> 02:05:53.250
<v Speaker 3>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for a guy like me,</v>

2596
02:05:53.730 --> 02:05:55.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Jones is 26 years old.</v>

2597
02:05:55.861 --> 02:05:56.694
<v Speaker 3>He's a phenomenal fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think that it really had </v>

2598
02:05:58.771 --> 02:05:59.604
<v Speaker 3>anything to do with any other thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was that when you were on </v>

2599
02:06:03.151 --> 02:06:06.060
<v Speaker 3>cocaine and that year afterward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine,</v>

2600
02:06:06.090 --> 02:06:08.360
<v Speaker 3>thanks to pleasure patterns out of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

2601
02:06:08.710 --> 02:06:09.543
<v Speaker 3>I'll be your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not the same or tone and the </v>

2602
02:06:11.191 --> 02:06:12.360
<v Speaker 3>Melatonin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2603
02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:13.613
<v Speaker 3>Don't correct me on this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I feel that it took me a year to 18 </v>

2604
02:06:19.891 --> 02:06:20.724
<v Speaker 3>months for me to just become a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>again and I haven't gotten hit in the </v>

2605
02:06:25.831 --> 02:06:26.664
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not since I was about 13 I got beat up </v>

2606
02:06:28.441 --> 02:06:29.274
<v Speaker 3>by the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried the Mug and I got hit in the </v>

2607
02:06:30.841 --> 02:06:31.674
<v Speaker 3>head with a flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really took me 18 months to embrace </v>

2608
02:06:34.981 --> 02:06:35.720
<v Speaker 3>your man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2610
02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I want you to remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to think of that morning,</v>

2611
02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:44.860
<v Speaker 3>what happened in Santa Fe with when he </v>
<v Speaker 3>ran the light and he ran away from that.</v>

2612
02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:46.410
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

2613
02:06:46.410 --> 02:06:47.700
<v Speaker 3>What was he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

2614
02:06:48.090 --> 02:06:50.220
<v Speaker 3>do you think he just woke up and was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to church?</v>

2615
02:06:50.221 --> 02:06:51.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was out the night before.</v>

2616
02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:53.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could have very well been out from </v>

2617
02:06:54.151 --> 02:06:54.350
<v Speaker 3>the night.</v>

2618
02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:55.420
<v Speaker 3>There's no pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2619
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:59.130
<v Speaker 3>you take,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes your mind a long time.</v>

2620
02:06:59.730 --> 02:07:02.010
<v Speaker 3>You know what's the thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I get off the juice,</v>

2621
02:07:02.310 --> 02:07:04.740
<v Speaker 3>I got to do something for my boss to </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow again.</v>

2622
02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:07.770
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to take something called </v>
<v Speaker 3>clomiphene.</v>

2623
02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.633
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what?</v>

2624
02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a couple of different ones.</v>

2625
02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:12.840
<v Speaker 3>Apparently a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's an estrogen blocker.</v>

2626
02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:13.733
<v Speaker 3>It blocks your estrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually one of the things that </v>

2627
02:07:14.911 --> 02:07:15.744
<v Speaker 3>John tested positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how long would it take for me to get </v>

2628
02:07:17.731 --> 02:07:19.980
<v Speaker 3>my balls back again?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd take you a little while.</v>

2629
02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:20.963
<v Speaker 3>Hey Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stayed here the amount of time that </v>

2630
02:07:22.711 --> 02:07:23.910
<v Speaker 3>you were doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2631
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:24.863
<v Speaker 3>see if that's why you're only supposed </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go on like a short cycle unless </v>

2632
02:07:27.601 --> 02:07:30.380
<v Speaker 3>you're a crazy bodybuilder guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those guys just stay on it all the time.</v>

2633
02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Thing with the cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro.</v>

2634
02:07:31.830 --> 02:07:32.663
<v Speaker 3>I thought about your statement and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>went home and started writing and </v>

2635
02:07:35.111 --> 02:07:35.944
<v Speaker 3>thinking</v>

2636
02:07:37.120 --> 02:07:37.953
<v Speaker 2>I got off November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2007 it took me a year and a half just </v>

2637
02:07:43.001 --> 02:07:45.430
<v Speaker 2>to become a human being to realize I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>

2638
02:07:45.490 --> 02:07:48.070
<v Speaker 2>I was 400 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need it to go to weight watchers.</v>

2639
02:07:49.050 --> 02:07:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Took me 18 months to realize I hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>married.</v>

2640
02:07:51.251 --> 02:07:56.251
<v Speaker 2>My wife took me a long time for my brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think normal.</v>

2641
02:07:56.891 --> 02:07:58.320
<v Speaker 2>Like anybody else does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2642
02:07:59.110 --> 02:08:01.360
<v Speaker 2>So I want you to take that into </v>
<v Speaker 2>consideration.</v>

2643
02:08:01.361 --> 02:08:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Or deb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely do.</v>

2644
02:08:02.501 --> 02:08:04.990
<v Speaker 2>I know you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree to me a long time.</v>

2645
02:08:05.340 --> 02:08:08.630
<v Speaker 2>You know when you do blow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you go on stage to say,</v>

2646
02:08:08.650 --> 02:08:11.500
<v Speaker 2>if I do blow three nights in a week and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I go on stage,</v>

2647
02:08:11.770 --> 02:08:13.210
<v Speaker 2>I have no control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan,</v>

2648
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:16.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at you in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see me on stage.</v>

2649
02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:17.913
<v Speaker 2>I have no control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no connection from my brain to </v>

2650
02:08:21.881 --> 02:08:25.000
<v Speaker 2>what's coming out of my mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

2651
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:26.200
<v Speaker 2>Now you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you,</v>

2652
02:08:26.410 --> 02:08:28.000
<v Speaker 2>are you speaking to rats now?</v>

2653
02:08:28.990 --> 02:08:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was empty words.</v>

2654
02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:34.060
<v Speaker 2>There was no passion behind that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it wasn't funny.</v>

2655
02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:34.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said to me,</v>

2656
02:08:35.320 --> 02:08:37.630
<v Speaker 2>you said it blocks love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blocks the love.</v>

2657
02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:41.200
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The love in between my,</v>

2658
02:08:41.310 --> 02:08:46.030
<v Speaker 2>the cocaine in my words is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what stimulus do.</v>

2659
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:46.893
<v Speaker 2>Stimulants or ramp up the aggression and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impulsiveness and they ramp up your </v>

2660
02:08:52.810 --> 02:08:53.643
<v Speaker 2>fearlessness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ramp up your courage and get </v>

2661
02:08:55.061 --> 02:08:55.894
<v Speaker 2>disproportionate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ramp up your ego like some </v>

2662
02:08:58.331 --> 02:08:59.164
<v Speaker 2>stimulants on some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people obviously look to people </v>

2663
02:09:01.511 --> 02:09:04.420
<v Speaker 2>that can handle booze and these people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that can't amble even a little booze.</v>

2664
02:09:04.570 --> 02:09:06.010
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the same with </v>
<v Speaker 2>stimulants.</v>

2665
02:09:06.011 --> 02:09:07.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the same with pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

2666
02:09:07.601 --> 02:09:09.880
<v Speaker 2>every almost every life experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2667
02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some people that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>handle things and some people that can't</v>

2668
02:09:12.611 --> 02:09:14.950
<v Speaker 2>and some people that can't at first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they eventually learn to.</v>

2669
02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:16.353
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone sent me something about Rodney </v>

<v Speaker 1>would discuss in the comedy scene in </v>

2734
02:12:05.461 --> 02:12:07.600
<v Speaker 1>North Carolina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing how it was judged.</v>

2735
02:12:07.650 --> 02:12:08.483
<v Speaker 1>I just want to thank new people and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>week before that I was in Austin and </v>

2736
02:12:12.451 --> 02:12:13.284
<v Speaker 1>that place is like this last time I got </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotional and Austin like I don't know </v>

2737
02:12:17.791 --> 02:12:22.560
<v Speaker 1>how many times I drove from Houston to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Austin to do the open Mike on Wednesday,</v>

2738
02:12:22.561 --> 02:12:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan and that little stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you looking at your face five</v>

2739
02:12:27.091 --> 02:12:30.450
<v Speaker 1>times and now I was headlining and </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling the place.</v>

2740
02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:31.653
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't walk in that dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did the open mic for Margie and she </v>

2741
02:12:34.831 --> 02:12:36.200
<v Speaker 1>would tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're too dirty for me.</v>

2742
02:12:37.230 --> 02:12:38.420
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2743
02:12:38.760 --> 02:12:39.593
<v Speaker 1>I'll be at the Austin is fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really weird to see the growth of </v>

2744
02:12:46.290 --> 02:12:48.930
<v Speaker 1>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

2745
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:52.350
<v Speaker 1>to see the growth of comedy in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities,</v>

2746
02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Portland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>

2747
02:12:54.240 --> 02:12:57.120
<v Speaker 1>like that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how fidelity took over Cuba.</v>

2748
02:12:58.050 --> 02:12:58.883
<v Speaker 1>Just little growth in different areas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and internet that has made people more </v>

2749
02:13:03.211 --> 02:13:04.044
<v Speaker 1>aware of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago we would go to Houston and </v>

2750
02:13:06.061 --> 02:13:06.894
<v Speaker 1>be excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would go to New York and maybe like </v>

2751
02:13:08.761 --> 02:13:09.594
<v Speaker 1>three other places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else was just a regular town </v>

2752
02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:16.290
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Freetown is excited about your rogue</v>

2753
02:13:16.291 --> 02:13:20.660
<v Speaker 1>and Bert Kreischer fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2754

2755
02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amy Wong,</v>

2756
02:13:25.050 --> 02:13:27.900

<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of grace.</v>

2757
02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:31.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking excited about people coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

2758
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:33.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

2759
02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:37.050
<v Speaker 2>we've seen this growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's been an amazing,</v>

2760
02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:37.681
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

2761
02:13:37.681 --> 02:13:40.200
<v Speaker 2>I got into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the tail.</v>

2762
02:13:40.201 --> 02:13:41.034
<v Speaker 2>And like when I got into comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people were telling you to Tobar kid </v>

2763
02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:44.573
<v Speaker 2>because five years before that ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>is we're getting 1500 plus add and </v>

2764
02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:53.010
<v Speaker 2>features again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2500% and have the line is we're getting</v>

2765
02:13:53.011 --> 02:13:56.100
<v Speaker 2>five grandpas and all of a sudden what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got it,</v>

2766
02:13:56.370 --> 02:14:00.990
<v Speaker 2>I still remember the first notes he gave</v>
<v Speaker 2>us was before you guys get into comedy,</v>

2767
02:14:00.991 --> 02:14:05.460
<v Speaker 2>I went in to tell you what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bubble busted and he broke down what</v>

2768
02:14:05.461 --> 02:14:08.310
<v Speaker 2>comics are getting paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't give a fuck.</v>

2769
02:14:08.670 --> 02:14:10.830
<v Speaker 2>He was just trying to discourage us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2770
02:14:10.831 --> 02:14:12.090
<v Speaker 2>he's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's wrong.</v>

2771
02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:14.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what the Bible is not writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>jokes.</v>

2772
02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:15.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the Bible does the Bible in </v>

2773
02:14:18.001 --> 02:14:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

2774
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:22.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what people blame it on the</v>

2775
02:14:22.171 --> 02:14:24.830
<v Speaker 2>access of comedy on television at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2776
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I believe that cause the great ones are </v>
<v Speaker 2>still there.</v>

2777
02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I think what happened was there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of guys that were really,</v>

2778
02:14:29.821 --> 02:14:30.571
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

2779
02:14:30.571 --> 02:14:31.404
<v Speaker 2>really fucking funny cause they had </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken their act and Polish that </v>

2780
02:14:33.781 --> 02:14:34.614
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker like a diamond and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they brought it to you and it was just </v>

2781
02:14:37.741 --> 02:14:39.210
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a perfect act,</v>

2782
02:14:39.211 --> 02:14:42.240
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a perfect piece of work.</v>

2783
02:14:42.330 --> 02:14:44.580
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't write more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some guys did,</v>

2784
02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:45.773
<v Speaker 2>but not enough guys dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people would keep coming back to </v>

2785
02:14:48.061 --> 02:14:50.550
<v Speaker 2>the shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'd be able to say the jokes word for</v>

2786
02:14:50.551 --> 02:14:53.310
<v Speaker 2>word year after year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they'd go to see some guys,</v>

2787
02:14:53.311 --> 02:14:56.850
<v Speaker 2>they would do the same act year after </v>
<v Speaker 2>year and they never left Boston.</v>

2788
02:14:57.210 --> 02:14:58.043
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very unfortunate thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>because like when it comes to like </v>

2789
02:14:59.821 --> 02:15:00.654
<v Speaker 2>proficiency level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's guys like Steve Sweeney that </v>

2790
02:15:02.911 --> 02:15:05.400
<v Speaker 2>used to kill in a way that you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

2791
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:07.980
<v Speaker 2>what's the guy that used to drink the </v>
<v Speaker 2>white Russians and a container?</v>

2792
02:15:08.010 --> 02:15:08.843
<v Speaker 2>Don motherfucking Gavin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gavin is one of the stuff for guys out </v>

2793
02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:14.790
<v Speaker 2>in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I started that you heard about your</v>

2794
02:15:14.791 --> 02:15:17.670
<v Speaker 2>boy too at the Tony Clark packing some </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat.</v>

2795
02:15:17.700 --> 02:15:21.000
<v Speaker 2>Let him when he was killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what's the guy that had the shows?</v>

2796
02:15:21.001 --> 02:15:22.560
<v Speaker 2>He was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 91,</v>

2797
02:15:22.561 --> 02:15:23.394
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony Clark married to Anthony Clark </v>

2798
02:15:26.911 --> 02:15:29.520
<v Speaker 2>was fucking throwing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a merge that murder.</v>

2799
02:15:29.610 --> 02:15:30.443
<v Speaker 2>He used to fill the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faneuil hall club with all screaming </v>

2800
02:15:33.391 --> 02:15:34.224
<v Speaker 2>checks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never saw anything like it cause he </v>

2801
02:15:35.281 --> 02:15:36.600
<v Speaker 2>was cute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2802
02:15:36.601 --> 02:15:38.370
<v Speaker 2>and he would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would be silly on stage.</v>

2803
02:15:38.371 --> 02:15:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Carl's loved him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean to the point where that place,</v>

2804
02:15:40.831 --> 02:15:43.470
<v Speaker 2>would it be overrun with girls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be like 80,</v>

2805
02:15:43.471 --> 02:15:46.200
<v Speaker 2>20 girls in this faneuil hall common </v>
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>

2806
02:15:46.230 --> 02:15:47.370
<v Speaker 2>We'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2807
02:15:47.580 --> 02:15:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Like what are their comic brings in </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls like this,</v>

2808
02:15:49.951 --> 02:15:51.900
<v Speaker 2>that love him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's another one,</v>

2809
02:15:51.930 --> 02:15:53.910
<v Speaker 2>they'd see the same bits over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>and over again.</v>

2810
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:55.710
<v Speaker 2>They didn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would find with it.</v>

2811
02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:57.420
<v Speaker 2>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a weird time.</v>

2812
02:15:57.780 --> 02:16:02.100
<v Speaker 2>What fucked everybody up was people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go to see someone special,</v>

2813
02:16:02.101 --> 02:16:02.934
<v Speaker 2>like Kennison did a special and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to do the material from the </v>

2814
02:16:06.061 --> 02:16:06.894
<v Speaker 2>special on a show and the people already</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew the material and they were like </v>

2815
02:16:09.631 --> 02:16:10.464
<v Speaker 2>yelling out bits and fucking up beds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think comics then started </v>

2816
02:16:13.831 --> 02:16:14.664
<v Speaker 2>realizing once you do like a real </v>
<v Speaker 2>special and put it on hbo or something </v>

2817
02:16:18.391 --> 02:16:19.224
<v Speaker 2>like that and it makes you famous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to throw that shit away and </v>

2818
02:16:21.571 --> 02:16:24.910
<v Speaker 2>write a completely new set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's so tough now Tara,</v>

2819
02:16:24.911 --> 02:16:25.744
<v Speaker 2>because you're trying to develop your </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour on the road and you put your wire </v>

2820
02:16:29.170 --> 02:16:30.003
<v Speaker 2>the road and you go off and follow a </v>
<v Speaker 2>week to promote that hour and you got </v>

2821
02:16:35.261 --> 02:16:36.094
<v Speaker 2>the same half you got half hour or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>hour unless you're fucking Harry </v>

2822
02:16:40.270 --> 02:16:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Houdini.</v>

2823
02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:41.653
<v Speaker 2>Well now prepare for that already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went through after the last time </v>

2824
02:16:45.011 --> 02:16:45.844
<v Speaker 2>was a big fucking lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has that lesson that's going </v>

2825
02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:50.380
<v Speaker 2>through that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just putting this out.</v>

2826
02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:51.110
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2827
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those weeks when you're putting that</v>

2828
02:16:53.141 --> 02:16:54.340
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stay home.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stay at home.</v>

2830

<v Speaker 2>Don't try to do some stay home and get </v>

2831
02:16:58.181 --> 02:17:02.470
<v Speaker 2>15 minute bits of the show and once you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get six of those 15 minute bits,</v>

2832
02:17:02.830 --> 02:17:07.830
<v Speaker 2>then you go out and put 45 together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start from scratch and then what?</v>

2833
02:17:08.651 --> 02:17:11.410
<v Speaker 2>You still got 30 35 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you shut your bed,</v>

<v Speaker 2>once you shut that 50 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still have 35 minutes to work on it </v>

2835
02:17:15.911 --> 02:17:17.260
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Russell,</v>

<v Speaker 3>into a groove and the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

2912
02:20:44.960 --> 02:20:47.750
<v Speaker 3>let me break something down here at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy store and again,</v>

2913
02:20:47.751 --> 02:20:49.480

2915
02:20:51.471 --> 02:20:52.304
<v Speaker 3>just found this one out fucking three </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago when you got sick that night </v>

<v Speaker 3>You had the flu and they called me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That went through the belly flew and he </v>

2918
02:21:02.871 --> 02:21:03.704
<v Speaker 3>flew though I heard through the belly </v>
<v Speaker 3>room and I have this shirt analogy gone </v>

2919
02:21:07.490 --> 02:21:10.460
<v Speaker 3>at the belly room and it just wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

2920
02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:11.773
<v Speaker 3>The belly room does it where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why at the belly room does it require </v>

2921
02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:22.280
<v Speaker 3>the efficiency that the original room </v>
<v Speaker 3>required?</v>

2922
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:25.640
<v Speaker 3>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'd be,</v>

2923
02:21:25.680 --> 02:21:27.660
<v Speaker 3>you want to slow it down a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the belly rooms out.</v>

2924
02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:28.640
<v Speaker 3>You're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2925
02:21:28.641 --> 02:21:33.641
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sparring with you and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing 50% we're doing 30 now,</v>

2926
02:21:34.340 --> 02:21:35.173
<v Speaker 3>right in the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we do 50 it's a little too </v>

2927
02:21:39.291 --> 02:21:41.360
<v Speaker 3>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That two right there,</v>

2928
02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:42.673
<v Speaker 3>the energy's right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I learned this after 20 fucking </v>

2929
02:21:45.051 --> 02:21:45.884
<v Speaker 3>years of doing spots that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember the belly room was where I </v>

2930
02:21:48.681 --> 02:21:49.514
<v Speaker 3>learned the story though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before that I was rushing to the </v>

2931
02:21:53.100 --> 02:21:53.933
<v Speaker 3>punchline and not getting into a joke </v>
<v Speaker 3>out the belly room was where I learned </v>

2932
02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:03.590
<v Speaker 3>to sit back a little bit and explain </v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck you,</v>

2933
02:22:03.591 --> 02:22:07.430
<v Speaker 3>what it is you're trying to tell us why </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just kept telling me,</v>

2934
02:22:07.431 --> 02:22:08.520
<v Speaker 3>what did you just say?</v>

2935
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:11.120
<v Speaker 3>There's no segue here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing to joey.</v>

2936

<v Speaker 3>is great and we don't want to hear that.</v>

2937
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:16.363
<v Speaker 3>We want to hear how you got that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned that in 99 and the belly room </v>

2954
02:23:07.531 --> 02:23:10.150
<v Speaker 3>kick at the original room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2956

<v Speaker 3>The original room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to follow Joe Rogan,</v>

2957
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:17.910
<v Speaker 3>Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Leah or bill burl like I had a couple of</v>

2958
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:19.920
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to come out from the curtain.</v>

2959
02:23:20.430 --> 02:23:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Until a flying side kick upward.</v>

2960
02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:26.910
<v Speaker 3>It's just hasn't been done since Bruce </v>
<v Speaker 3>Lee and the Chinese connection.</v>

2961
02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:28.980
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's me.</v>

2962
02:23:28.981 --> 02:23:31.920
<v Speaker 3>And you would usually do a flying </v>
<v Speaker 3>sidekick from an evil ground.</v>

2963
02:23:32.340 --> 02:23:33.720
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to go upward.</v>

2964
02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:37.770
<v Speaker 3>That's their comedy and the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>original rule.</v>

2965
02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:41.370
<v Speaker 3>That's where you see me go bananas where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've seen me at my best,</v>

2966
02:23:41.730 --> 02:23:45.960
<v Speaker 3>like crazy red in the face about to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>a heart attack.</v>

2967
02:23:46.410 --> 02:23:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Pitching your heart out on stage.</v>

2968
02:23:48.720 --> 02:23:51.720
<v Speaker 3>You have to come out with a flying site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy move you,</v>

2969
02:23:51.721 --> 02:23:54.510
<v Speaker 3>but you go on a vertical or a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2970
02:23:54.750 --> 02:23:55.583
<v Speaker 3>You're on your back kick and y'all got </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get out my shoulders and kick up and </v>

2971
02:23:58.321 --> 02:24:01.050
<v Speaker 3>tried to get you in the drawer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the original room.</v>

2972
02:24:01.051 --> 02:24:04.230
<v Speaker 3>The belly room,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the rest on my right hook.</v>

2973
02:24:04.620 --> 02:24:07.800
<v Speaker 3>I could rest on my one toe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The belly room.</v>

2974
02:24:07.801 --> 02:24:08.634
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could breathe and just throw one twos </v>

2975
02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:11.153
<v Speaker 3>and keep you off me deep breathe deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kept my composure and even though you </v>

2976
02:24:17.461 --> 02:24:19.620
<v Speaker 3>hit me with some of those zoom guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh slugs,</v>

2977
02:24:20.090 --> 02:24:21.690
<v Speaker 3>I got him whom?</v>
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2978
02:24:21.691 --> 02:24:24.150
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I keep my hands up and stay away from</v>

2979
02:24:24.151 --> 02:24:25.380
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll be okay.</v>

2980
02:24:25.800 --> 02:24:26.633
<v Speaker 3>That's the belly room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why the belly room I always </v>

2981
02:24:29.581 --> 02:24:31.500
<v Speaker 3>thought would be a great place to shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>us.</v>

2982
02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:32.820
<v Speaker 3>You know what's great about the belly </v>
<v Speaker 3>rooms?</v>

2983
02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:34.170
<v Speaker 3>The same thing that's great about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>White House.</v>

2984
02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:35.880
<v Speaker 3>The Ice House Annex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second room.</v>

2985
02:24:35.910 --> 02:24:39.390
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like there's no room for an act.</v>

2986
02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:41.250
<v Speaker 3>There's no room for an ax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too intimate.</v>

2987
02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:42.413
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to figure out where's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>no fat aspect of the bet and you got to </v>

2988
02:24:45.481 --> 02:24:48.690
<v Speaker 3>be tuned into the bet they feel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With my 55th birthday up there,</v>

2989
02:24:49.290 --> 02:24:51.720
<v Speaker 3>I put the Ice House.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What days at,</v>

2990
02:24:51.780 --> 02:24:52.613
<v Speaker 3>it's a Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The 19th so 19th I can't get the comedy </v>

2991
02:24:55.111 --> 02:24:57.720
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I got the original room.</v>

2992
02:24:57.780 --> 02:24:58.613
<v Speaker 3>I got the a small room at the ice house </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the 17th and 19th and then the 18th </v>

2993
02:25:03.901 --> 02:25:08.370
<v Speaker 3>I've got the original room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got the belly room at the comedy store</v>

2994
02:25:08.730 --> 02:25:11.160
<v Speaker 3>and it's the night before George </v>
<v Speaker 3>Washington's birthday.</v>

2995
02:25:11.790 --> 02:25:16.140
<v Speaker 3>So I got people doing that one too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I turned 55 that weekend.</v>

2996
02:25:16.170 --> 02:25:18.690
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And working out with Uncle Joey,</v>

2997
02:25:18.780 --> 02:25:20.910
<v Speaker 3>I only tried to 10 or 15 bucks.</v>

2998
02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:24.460
<v Speaker 3>I do that once a month and I go on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage too.</v>

2999
02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:26.590
<v Speaker 3>And you just fuck around you just </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>

3000
02:25:26.591 --> 02:25:27.424
<v Speaker 3>I write down in a notebook that I don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>really know about and we develop it </v>

3001
02:25:30.851 --> 02:25:33.280
<v Speaker 3>together up there and sometimes it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>phenomenal.</v>

3002
02:25:33.610 --> 02:25:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Nine at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is phenomenal.</v>

3003
02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:36.850
<v Speaker 3>It's a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would they tell you?</v>

3004
02:25:36.851 --> 02:25:37.684
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I met 30% I purposely the </v>

3005
02:25:41.151 --> 02:25:43.840
<v Speaker 3>mandible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is purposely,</v>

3006
02:25:44.050 --> 02:25:46.480
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The comedy store on a Saturday night?</v>

3007
02:25:46.510 --> 02:25:47.470
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3008
02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:50.530
<v Speaker 3>I purposely did that ability to take the</v>
<v Speaker 3>edge off.</v>

3009
02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:53.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might even have a shot of alcohol.</v>

3010
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:54.130
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>

3011
02:25:54.460 --> 02:25:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Just one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's three point.</v>

3012
02:25:56.070 --> 02:25:56.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause,</v>

3013
02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:58.630
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't eat much alcohol.</v>

3014
02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:00.753
<v Speaker 3>So I'll do it edible and have a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>shot of alcohol at the Ice House and </v>

3015
02:26:03.611 --> 02:26:07.420
<v Speaker 3>tape it and always get one or two great </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

3016
02:26:07.421 --> 02:26:08.254

3017
02:26:09.971 --> 02:26:10.804

<v Speaker 3>but because you're so relaxed and they </v>

3018
02:26:14.621 --> 02:26:17.050
<v Speaker 3>know what they're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a big difference job.</v>

3030
02:26:39.880 --> 02:26:41.880
<v Speaker 3>Take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't care how bow,</v>

3031
02:26:42.310 --> 02:26:44.570
<v Speaker 3>that's what you do before you shoot a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking.</v>

3032
02:26:44.660 --> 02:26:45.850
<v Speaker 3>You need all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3033
02:26:45.880 --> 02:26:47.770
<v Speaker 3>You need to sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need the writing.</v>

3034
02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:49.780
<v Speaker 3>You need to set all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to riding.</v>

3035
02:26:49.781 --> 02:26:52.900
<v Speaker 3>You need to working out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your head's gotta be at the right place.</v>

3036
02:26:52.930 --> 02:26:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what else?</v>

3037
02:26:54.161 --> 02:26:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I think you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you need friendship?</v>

3038
02:26:56.080 --> 02:26:57.600
<v Speaker 3>I think that helps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that would,</v>

3039
02:26:57.610 --> 02:26:58.443
<v Speaker 3>I think that when you set up to me on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the phone the other day and you also </v>

3040
02:27:01.751 --> 02:27:04.360
<v Speaker 3>know that you got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I get there,</v>

3041
02:27:04.361 --> 02:27:06.160
<v Speaker 3>you got to leave some stuff to aggravate</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

3042
02:27:06.340 --> 02:27:10.570
<v Speaker 3>But I've thought about this many times </v>
<v Speaker 3>like who would I be without you guys?</v>

3043
02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:13.270
<v Speaker 3>Like who would I be without you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would I be without Eddie?</v>

3044
02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:16.000
<v Speaker 3>Who would that be without red band?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who would that be without Ari?</v>

3045
02:27:16.001 --> 02:27:18.160
<v Speaker 3>Who would that be with that Dunkin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about the same.</v>

3046
02:27:18.161 --> 02:27:19.990
<v Speaker 3>The Thompson girls think about the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

3047
02:27:20.470 --> 02:27:22.450
<v Speaker 3>Who would I be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are these people like Bert.</v>

3048
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:24.060
<v Speaker 3>They mean a lot to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they're,</v>

3049
02:27:24.061 --> 02:27:26.020
<v Speaker 3>they're very important people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's your family,</v>

3050
02:27:26.021 --> 02:27:28.390
<v Speaker 3>which is through the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

3051
02:27:28.420 --> 02:27:31.570
<v Speaker 3>That kind of love is very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That that kind of love is over.</v>

3052
02:27:31.720 --> 02:27:34.630
<v Speaker 3>Whelming how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much it changes who you are.</v>

3053
02:27:34.780 --> 02:27:35.613
<v Speaker 3>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were talking about the tower g come </v>

3054
02:27:37.691 --> 02:27:40.450
<v Speaker 3>doe the Bruce Lee Book and you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that,</v>

3055
02:27:40.451 --> 02:27:43.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of excerpts were stolen and the,</v>

3056
02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:45.250
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not even,</v>

3057
02:27:45.251 --> 02:27:47.320
<v Speaker 3>and that's not the proper word that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>used.</v>

3058
02:27:47.700 --> 02:27:48.533
<v Speaker 3>Play drives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a tie with Joey Diaz and half of </v>

3059
02:27:52.151 --> 02:27:55.180
<v Speaker 3>that tile is what I learned from Joe </v>
<v Speaker 3>Rogan.</v>

3060
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:56.583
<v Speaker 3>The other half of that ty was what I </v>
<v Speaker 3>learned from my Ra and working with </v>

3061
02:27:58.961 --> 02:28:01.900
<v Speaker 3>Dunkin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of us are very original.</v>

3062
02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:04.450
<v Speaker 3>I just kicked it up a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3063
02:28:04.451 --> 02:28:05.284

3064
02:28:08.321 --> 02:28:10.790

<v Speaker 3>When I go into a town,</v>

3065

<v Speaker 3>everything up.</v>

<v Speaker 3>combine it and that's what we're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>

3091
02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:29.600
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd think I'm johnny original.</v>

3092
02:29:29.660 --> 02:29:32.330
<v Speaker 3>I'd take a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned from Bert.</v>

3093
02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:35.660
<v Speaker 3>I learned from Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I learned from Bill Burr,</v>

3094
02:29:36.110 --> 02:29:40.640
<v Speaker 3>I learned from Dave Chapelle and now </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is your art again,</v>

3095
02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:42.163
<v Speaker 3>there's every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the arm bar is the same whether I go to </v>

3096
02:29:44.001 --> 02:29:45.750
<v Speaker 3>you or John Jockey and showing me the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same thing,</v>

3097
02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:48.020

<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

3098
02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:49.430
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same point.</v>

3099
02:29:49.431 --> 02:29:50.264
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's no way you could ever </v>

3100
02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:53.923
<v Speaker 3>say any one person is not influenced </v>
<v Speaker 3>because every single style of standup </v>

3101
02:29:57.320 --> 02:29:58.153
<v Speaker 3>comedy is in some way or another or </v>
<v Speaker 3>originated was like the Lenny Bruce's </v>

3102
02:30:02.720 --> 02:30:05.660
<v Speaker 3>and you know the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dick Gregory's and the,</v>

3103
02:30:05.661 --> 02:30:07.160
<v Speaker 3>you know the guys who were doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

3104
02:30:07.210 --> 02:30:11.240
<v Speaker 3>the danger fields guys doing it way back</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the day and even Bob Hope,</v>

3105
02:30:11.720 --> 02:30:13.970
<v Speaker 3>all those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they started this thing.</v>

3106
02:30:14.090 --> 02:30:14.923
<v Speaker 3>You got to think the world has had no </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy up until like what a </v>

3107
02:30:19.940 --> 02:30:21.800
<v Speaker 3>hundred and fucking 50 years ago or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

3108
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:24.380
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This shit just started and the owner was</v>

3109
02:30:24.381 --> 02:30:27.230
<v Speaker 3>one of the first guys to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mark motherfucking twain.</v>

3110
02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:28.303
<v Speaker 3>Mark motherfucking twain would do </v>
<v Speaker 3>readings of his book and it was funny </v>

<v Speaker 3>and people would laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in front of people rocking.</v>

3112
02:30:34.220 --> 02:30:35.053
<v Speaker 3>He was killing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's telling stories and reading and </v>

3113
02:30:37.491 --> 02:30:39.350
<v Speaker 3>people thought he was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would give speeches.</v>

3114
02:30:40.110 --> 02:30:42.680

02:33:23.731 --> 02:33:24.564
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to just be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be accepted as a comedian </v>

3178
02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:30.570
<v Speaker 1>and ever since I've been going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth wall,</v>

3179
02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I go there three or four nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm no better than anybody else,</v>

3181
02:33:36.690 --> 02:33:37.523
<v Speaker 1>but the main thing is he asked me what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go up and I always tell him </v>

3182
02:33:40.771 --> 02:33:45.060
<v Speaker 1>towards the end because I want to watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kids and joy.</v>

3186
02:33:55.591 --> 02:33:56.424
<v Speaker 1>do five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think about when you were </v>

3187
02:33:59.881 --> 02:34:02.860
<v Speaker 1>doing five minutes and what was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through your head.</v>

3188

<v Speaker 1>I'm just telling you my heart's beating </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I stood.</v>

3189
02:34:05.951 --> 02:34:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I remember bombing and leaving there </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

3190
02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:09.473
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to get a little way </v>

3191
02:34:09.811 --> 02:34:13.350
<v Speaker 1>the job or now you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get a cook job.</v>

3192
02:34:13.351 --> 02:34:17.980
<v Speaker 1>These guys all have day jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all talked about this jobs,</v>

3193
02:34:18.610 --> 02:34:20.740
<v Speaker 3>but every time I go to the fourth ward,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

3194
02:34:20.800 --> 02:34:24.850

<v Speaker 3>I go there some nights I go to flappers,</v>

3195
02:34:25.210 --> 02:34:27.130
<v Speaker 3>I go there some nights I go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>store,</v>

3196
02:34:27.940 --> 02:34:32.940
<v Speaker 3>I go there some nights I go to the how I</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it that way,</v>

3197
02:34:32.981 --> 02:34:33.814

<v Speaker 3>go there I always go there with like </v>

3198
02:34:36.911 --> 02:34:37.744
<v Speaker 3>five minutes planned pro.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't even hit the stage because </v>

3199
02:34:41.741 --> 02:34:45.610
<v Speaker 3>from watching those guys I learned </v>
<v Speaker 3>something and I remember something and I</v>

3200
02:34:45.611 --> 02:34:46.444
<v Speaker 3>just come up with this crazy story so I </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at it as like a like doing </v>

3201
02:34:50.681 --> 02:34:52.390
<v Speaker 3>kettlebells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3202
02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:55.060
<v Speaker 3>that's a good way to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

3203
02:34:55.061 --> 02:34:55.894
<v Speaker 3>I look at these young guys and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember that pain and that confusion </v>

3204
02:34:58.301 --> 02:34:59.134
<v Speaker 3>that I had that fucking feeling you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were an open mike or in your </v>

3205
02:35:02.741 --> 02:35:06.310
<v Speaker 3>friends are telling me you were funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you still had to drive the limo,</v>

3206
02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:07.173
<v Speaker 3>keep the paper job route or still drop </v>
<v Speaker 3>off papers or whatever the fuck job you </v>

3207
02:35:11.081 --> 02:35:11.914
<v Speaker 3>said you had.</v>

3208
02:35:12.190 --> 02:35:14.950
<v Speaker 3>You told me the story about meeting at </v>
<v Speaker 3>he Atlantic's and all that.</v>

3209
02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:20.340
<v Speaker 3>You're still in that crossroads of </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy where you don't know what to do,</v>

3210
02:35:20.381 --> 02:35:25.381
<v Speaker 3>but you know in your fucking hard that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just can't wait to be a headliner if</v>

3211
02:35:26.431 --> 02:35:29.500
<v Speaker 3>somebody would just give you a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back then,</v>

3212
02:35:29.501 --> 02:35:31.600
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't even thinking I can never be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>headliner.</v>

3213
02:35:31.690 --> 02:35:34.000
<v Speaker 3>I was really just hoping I could make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>living.</v>

3214
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:38.560
<v Speaker 3>I never thought I'd wind up being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you mean living,</v>

3215
02:35:38.561 --> 02:35:42.130
<v Speaker 3>you mean food?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A one bedroom cable TV.</v>

3216
02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:44.740
<v Speaker 3>There was a guy that had a fucking loft.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the king.</v>

3217
02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:45.913
<v Speaker 3>I had a loft it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd taken a school house and turned </v>

3218
02:35:47.921 --> 02:35:49.870
<v Speaker 3>it into condominiums.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy,</v>

3219
02:35:49.871 --> 02:35:50.920
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget.</v>

3220
02:35:50.921 --> 02:35:51.754
<v Speaker 3>I looked up to him like I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe where he was living in Dj </v>

3221
02:35:54.370 --> 02:35:54.851
<v Speaker 3>Hazard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's his name.</v>

3222
02:35:54.851 --> 02:35:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Hilarious comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Well Dj has always been a real nice guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and an excellent guy.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Very funny,</v>

3226
02:36:02.351 --> 02:36:03.184

<v Speaker 3>but I remember he had like a loft </v>

3227
02:36:05.231 --> 02:36:07.180
<v Speaker 3>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember everybody talked about it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This got brick walls inside.</v>

3229
02:36:09.770 --> 02:36:11.020
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was the king.</v>

3230
02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:13.160
<v Speaker 3>He was living like an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he was,</v>

3231
02:36:13.720 --> 02:36:16.480
<v Speaker 3>he was a standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody else.</v>

3232
02:36:16.481 --> 02:36:17.920
<v Speaker 3>We had thought about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3233
02:36:17.921 --> 02:36:18.754
<v Speaker 3>you're living like you're barely getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>by stuffing a bunch of guys and do a </v>

3234
02:36:20.351 --> 02:36:21.440
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3235
02:36:21.470 --> 02:36:24.580
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of like comedy flop </v>
<v Speaker 3>houses or comedians would wind up moving</v>

3236
02:36:24.581 --> 02:36:25.414
<v Speaker 3>in together or you're living in some </v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty apartment and he could barely </v>

3237
02:36:27.671 --> 02:36:28.504
<v Speaker 3>afford.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you living with your girlfriend or </v>

3238
02:36:29.411 --> 02:36:30.244
<v Speaker 3>something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird when you go back and think </v>

3239

<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>

3242
02:36:38.661 --> 02:36:42.860
<v Speaker 3>Think about it your early days when it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible and it just bombed all the time</v>

<v Speaker 3>comedian when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're not going to get a piece of ass </v>

3465
02:47:16.221 --> 02:47:19.070
<v Speaker 3>by selling somebody real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to sell them Dick.</v>

3466
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:21.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ones that it works on,</v>

3467
02:47:21.370 --> 02:47:22.203
<v Speaker 3>that's the ones you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you can go up to a gal and say </v>

3468
02:47:24.291 --> 02:47:25.580
<v Speaker 3>that to her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3469
02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:26.953
<v Speaker 3>you gotta write me already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where if I knew who you were a girl and </v>

3470
02:47:30.081 --> 02:47:33.860
<v Speaker 3>I knew you did coke and you had that </v>
<v Speaker 3>certain look in your eyes,</v>

3471
02:47:33.890 --> 02:47:38.890
<v Speaker 3>what's the cluck to the look?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is when you do cocaine,</v>

3472
02:47:40.851 --> 02:47:41.684
<v Speaker 3>you do dirty fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you look at a girl that's doing </v>

3473
02:47:45.531 --> 02:47:50.120
<v Speaker 3>cocaine and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she suggest to you that she's going back</v>

3474
02:47:50.121 --> 02:47:51.290
<v Speaker 3>to your hotel with you.</v>

3475
02:47:51.770 --> 02:47:52.603
<v Speaker 3>It's time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody goes back to the hotel with you </v>

3476
02:47:55.641 --> 02:48:00.530
<v Speaker 3>when they have a boyfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing coke at time,</v>

3477
02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:03.890
<v Speaker 3>because percentages keep getting go </v>
<v Speaker 3>higher and higher.</v>

3478
02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:06.110
<v Speaker 3>What Cook apparently makes people </v>
<v Speaker 3>promiscuous,</v>

3479
02:48:06.111 --> 02:48:06.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3480
02:48:06.550 --> 02:48:09.320
<v Speaker 3>It makes people go fucking bananas to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck a Dick.</v>

3481
02:48:09.321 --> 02:48:13.880
<v Speaker 3>So you take somebody who's wife up to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your hotel room and then 6:00</v>

3482
02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:14.713
<v Speaker 3>AM she's doing coke with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'll notice that one of the times she </v>

3483
02:48:16.911 --> 02:48:19.070
<v Speaker 3>comes out of the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the button,</v>

3484
02:48:19.071 --> 02:48:20.780
<v Speaker 3>it'll be opened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3485
02:48:21.290 --> 02:48:22.123
<v Speaker 3>Then the next time she comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she'll come out to tell you a story and </v>

3486
02:48:25.161 --> 02:48:28.610
<v Speaker 3>her pants will come out and show button </v>
<v Speaker 3>them in front of the little things start</v>

3487
02:48:28.611 --> 02:48:32.000
<v Speaker 3>to happen if you signs and pretty soon </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Take off your pants.</v>

3490
02:48:34.431 --> 02:48:36.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna see you play with your pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do,</v>

3494
02:48:38.390 --> 02:48:40.920
<v Speaker 3>That's what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what gets me right now is the,</v>

3495
02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:43.870
<v Speaker 3>the 20 year call out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 30 call.</v>

3496
02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:46.220
<v Speaker 3>I ain't going to ruin Dustin Hoffman's </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He was giving out foot rubs.</v>

3498
02:48:48.171 --> 02:48:52.700
<v Speaker 3>He was asking him ask him acting creepy </v>
<v Speaker 3>black.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know what bro?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Part of that shit,</v>

3500

<v Speaker 3>but I noticed that you didn't notice it.</v>

3504
02:49:08.430 --> 02:49:09.263
<v Speaker 3>The cocaine thing is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is a real interesting one because you </v>

3505
02:49:11.281 --> 02:49:15.510
<v Speaker 3>see people making crazy decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just real nutty fucking decisions.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3510
02:49:28.141 --> 02:49:28.974
<v Speaker 3>Now that comes to a point where you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>this paranoia where you don't leave the </v>

3511
02:49:31.861 --> 02:49:34.830
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now that comes through with paranoid</v>

3512
02:49:34.831 --> 02:49:38.640
<v Speaker 3>that you're going to leave the house and</v>
<v Speaker 3>bump into somebody and guess what?</v>

3513
02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:40.013
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you actually do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go to a seven 11 together soda and </v>

3514
02:49:44.461 --> 02:49:48.030
<v Speaker 3>you bump into somebody who was in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same predicament as you.</v>

3515
02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:49.373
<v Speaker 3>That happened to me once I was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went by Gavin's I think I was staying </v>

3516
02:49:53.641 --> 02:49:57.090
<v Speaker 3>with Ralphie and I went by Gavin's and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the first floor.</v>

3517
02:49:57.091 --> 02:49:57.924
<v Speaker 3>They was just checked that we used to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a stripper and she had a daughter that </v>

3518
02:50:00.631 --> 02:50:03.540
<v Speaker 3>was about 13 kind of ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She always like Pavarotti.</v>

3519
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:07.590
<v Speaker 3>We used to call it bob or cause she had </v>
<v Speaker 3>thick fucking eyebrows and shit,</v>

3520
02:50:08.130 --> 02:50:10.560
<v Speaker 3>but the mother was kind of a freak and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>got up like that.</v>

3521
02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:11.993
<v Speaker 3>Like I was up all night and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>nine in the morning and I was about to </v>

3522
02:50:14.371 --> 02:50:15.204
<v Speaker 3>call my drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get a package of 11 that keep the </v>

3523
02:50:17.641 --> 02:50:22.641
<v Speaker 3>body alive and I bumped into that animal</v>
<v Speaker 3>to stay away and she asked me like,</v>

3524
02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:25.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got some coke,</v>

3525
02:50:25.710 --> 02:50:30.710
<v Speaker 3>I was on my way and that chick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that chick was in gay,</v>

3526
02:50:32.090 --> 02:50:33.780
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget this.</v>

3527
02:50:33.780 --> 02:50:37.140
<v Speaker 3>She was engaged and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm on my way right now.</v>

3528
02:50:37.141 --> 02:50:38.560
<v Speaker 3>And she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you want to split the gram?</v>

3529
02:50:38.570 --> 02:50:38.960
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3530
02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:39.840
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's put the grab.</v>

3531
02:50:40.410 --> 02:50:42.230
<v Speaker 3>It was like 30 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We went over there,</v>

3532
02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:44.130
<v Speaker 3>we split the fucking grand and we went </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

3533
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:45.623
<v Speaker 3>Her daughter was sleeping so we had to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do the coke in the hallway on the first </v>

3534
02:50:49.351 --> 02:50:51.180
<v Speaker 3>floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3535
02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:53.080
<v Speaker 3>Under the stairway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3536
02:50:54.040 --> 02:50:54.873
<v Speaker 3>And after we did two blanks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were just thinking they are looking </v>

3537
02:50:56.761 --> 02:51:00.210
<v Speaker 3>at each other and she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even ask.</v>

3538
02:51:00.690 --> 02:51:01.523
<v Speaker 3>I just told the guy that was bothering </v>
<v Speaker 3>me all night that I wouldn't give him a </v>

3539
02:51:03.871 --> 02:51:04.291
<v Speaker 3>site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3540
02:51:04.291 --> 02:51:06.230
<v Speaker 3>oh listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's 10 in the morning,</v>

<v Speaker 3>We got to do something.</v>

3543

<v Speaker 3>And I started swapping spit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the next thing you know,</v>

3544

<v Speaker 3>went to come,</v>

3545
02:51:15.481 --> 02:51:16.530
<v Speaker 3>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>

3546
02:51:16.530 --> 02:51:18.580
<v Speaker 3>And I came on a jeans,</v>

02:55:03.710 --> 02:55:04.100
<v Speaker 3>He had</v>

3626
02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:05.770
<v Speaker 4>a look that heated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3627
02:55:06.220 --> 02:55:07.790
<v Speaker 4>no hitting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No hope.</v>

3628
02:55:08.020 --> 02:55:10.730
<v Speaker 4>He went into like a survival situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3629
02:55:10.731 --> 02:55:14.780
<v Speaker 4>like when you see a deer that's getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>attacked by a crocodile or something,</v>

3630
02:55:14.930 --> 02:55:18.110
<v Speaker 4>they have this like survival thing where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

3631
02:55:18.111 --> 02:55:20.900
<v Speaker 4>you're just trying to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously deer is not the same.</v>

3632
02:55:21.370 --> 02:55:22.880
<v Speaker 4>I that's terrible analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on,</v>

3633
02:55:22.881 --> 02:55:23.714
<v Speaker 4>let me correct this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I think is that Barboza had </v>

3634
02:55:25.761 --> 02:55:29.780
<v Speaker 4>realized that like there's no way he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to beat this guy on the ground.</v>

3635
02:55:29.781 --> 02:55:33.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think if he went to that fight,</v>

3636
02:55:33.380 --> 02:55:34.213
<v Speaker 4>probably thought he'd be able stuff more</v>
<v Speaker 4>take downs and probably be able to get </v>

3637
02:55:36.261 --> 02:55:38.810
<v Speaker 4>back off his feet because he was doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that with a lot of guys in camp.</v>

3638
02:55:39.260 --> 02:55:40.093
<v Speaker 4>But once that guy gets a hold of you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an acceptance that certain </v>

3639
02:55:43.581 --> 02:55:47.930
<v Speaker 4>fighters go through where they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're locked down like holy shit.</v>

3640
02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:48.793
<v Speaker 4>Like they're just drained from this </v>
<v Speaker 4>animal mall and them trying to retain </v>

3641
02:55:50.961 --> 02:55:53.210
<v Speaker 4>their energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to recharge their battery,</v>

3642
02:55:53.211 --> 02:55:54.044
<v Speaker 4>trying to get back in it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you've got to realize that guy </v>

3643
02:55:55.881 --> 02:55:59.180
<v Speaker 4>that's in proposals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the best fucking kickers ever,</v>

3644
02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:02.270
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's one of the best kickers ever.</v>

3645
02:56:02.720 --> 02:56:03.553
<v Speaker 4>That fucking guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the fastest switch kick I've ever seen </v>

3646
02:56:05.451 --> 02:56:06.284
<v Speaker 4>in my life outside of like professional </v>
<v Speaker 4>Moitai like San Chai or blue cow or </v>

3647
02:56:11.841 --> 02:56:14.900
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a world class left leg kick.</v>

3648
02:56:14.901 --> 02:56:17.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean woo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fast as fuck.</v>

3649
02:56:17.690 --> 02:56:20.120
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't keep that guy off him and it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was so scary.</v>

3650
02:56:20.121 --> 02:56:24.980
<v Speaker 4>That guy's face to me where he drilled </v>
<v Speaker 4>for hours.</v>

3651
02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:27.230
<v Speaker 4>He drilled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take down the fence,</v>

3652
02:56:27.231 --> 02:56:31.610
<v Speaker 4>he drove everything that was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he never drove this,</v>

3653
02:56:31.730 --> 02:56:34.430
<v Speaker 4>couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there was one point where he looked</v>

3654
02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:36.290
<v Speaker 4>and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a second,</v>

3655
02:56:37.190 --> 02:56:38.270
<v Speaker 4>I've done everything I can.</v>

3656
02:56:38.270 --> 02:56:40.490
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I even trained with the giants taking me</v>

3657
02:56:40.491 --> 02:56:42.840
<v Speaker 4>down for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Different animal.</v>

3658
02:56:42.940 --> 02:56:46.700
<v Speaker 4>It felt this depending on how he keeps </v>
<v Speaker 4>you down on either,</v>

3659
02:56:47.080 --> 02:56:52.040
<v Speaker 4>his control on that side is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that is,</v>

3660
02:56:52.730 --> 02:56:53.563
<v Speaker 4>there's certain guys that have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>grappling skill that it's very hard to </v>

3661
02:56:56.211 --> 02:56:57.044
<v Speaker 4>see when you look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're a skillful glow grappler </v>

3662
02:56:59.871 --> 02:57:00.704
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at someone like you like </v>

3663
02:57:02.181 --> 02:57:04.640
<v Speaker 4>why is he able to do that to everybody?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what?</v>

3664
02:57:04.880 --> 02:57:06.350
<v Speaker 4>What is he doing differently?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3665
02:57:06.351 --> 02:57:07.184
<v Speaker 4>why is this one guy being able to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain things and other people can't </v>

3666
02:57:09.351 --> 02:57:10.184
<v Speaker 4>do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a few of those guys out </v>

3667
02:57:11.331 --> 02:57:13.700
<v Speaker 4>there while you're watching me just go </v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus,</v>

3668
02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:16.030
<v Speaker 4>like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And but Comedians,</v>

3669
02:57:16.070 --> 02:57:19.190
<v Speaker 4>the number one guy in that category,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's never been defeated.</v>

3670
02:57:19.450 --> 02:57:21.960
<v Speaker 4>He said one moment of adversity in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>octagon.</v>

3671
02:57:21.961 --> 02:57:24.230
<v Speaker 4>I get clipped by a punch from Michael </v>
<v Speaker 4>Johnson.</v>

3672
02:57:24.890 --> 02:57:26.570
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of a single round.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's lost.</v>

3673
02:57:27.170 --> 02:57:28.003
<v Speaker 4>Not off the top of my head at least.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean he may have lost rounds on some </v>

3674
02:57:30.411 --> 02:57:31.244
<v Speaker 4>judges' scorecards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's essentially mauled every </v>

3675
02:57:33.231 --> 02:57:35.630
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker they put in front of him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's an animal.</v>

3676
02:57:36.020 --> 02:57:39.380
<v Speaker 4>So this guy versus Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's phenomenal fight.</v>

3677
02:57:39.770 --> 02:57:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Cause Tony is a savage and Tony fights </v>
<v Speaker 4>very well off of his back.</v>

3678
02:57:43.551 --> 02:57:47.030
<v Speaker 4>He is a seriously dangerous guard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't sleep on him.</v>

3679
02:57:47.180 --> 02:57:49.430
<v Speaker 4>He's durable as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can knock you out.</v>

3680
02:57:49.431 --> 02:57:51.350
<v Speaker 4>He never gets tired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's,</v>

3681
02:57:51.351 --> 02:57:53.930
<v Speaker 4>his game is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come and he's a fucking champ right</v>

3682
02:57:53.931 --> 02:57:55.190
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the interim champ.</v>

3683
02:57:55.550 --> 02:57:57.490
<v Speaker 4>You know when he beat Kevin Leave with a</v>
<v Speaker 4>triangle,</v>

3684
02:57:57.491 --> 02:58:00.350
<v Speaker 4>you'd beat a top guy like Kevin leave </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a fucking triangle.</v>

3685
02:58:00.740 --> 02:58:01.620
<v Speaker 4>That's a big move.</v>

3686
02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:03.750
<v Speaker 2>Tony's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nasty,</v>

3687
02:58:03.751 --> 02:58:05.730
<v Speaker 2>dark chokes is darce choke is one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>

3688
02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:07.980
<v Speaker 2>was great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wasn't ready for Talia.</v>

3689
02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:11.010
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Leach was sick to his staff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

3690
02:58:11.020 --> 02:58:13.780
<v Speaker 2>that's that action.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But note unquestionably hurt.</v>

3691
02:58:14.310 --> 02:58:17.880
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't totally as it's too high </v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

3692
02:58:17.881 --> 02:58:18.714
<v Speaker 2>That was to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see in the second round </v>

3693
02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:21.623
<v Speaker 2>perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see that fight to get </v>

3694
02:58:22.801 --> 02:58:23.634
<v Speaker 2>what you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to say that because that's how </v>

3695
02:58:24.241 --> 02:58:25.130
<v Speaker 2>it went down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

3696
02:58:25.620 --> 02:58:26.453
<v Speaker 2>But I think that if you wanted to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>them fight again and Kevin Lee can go </v>

3697
02:58:29.941 --> 02:58:30.774
<v Speaker 2>into that fight healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you'd see a very different </v>

3698
02:58:33.181 --> 02:58:35.010
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you would see tony.</v>

3699
02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:37.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that you would see tony </v>
<v Speaker 2>lose or Kevin when,</v>

3700
02:58:37.710 --> 02:58:38.543
<v Speaker 2>but I would think you would see a Kevin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee that could sustain its performance </v>

3701
02:58:41.041 --> 02:58:41.874
<v Speaker 2>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think being drained from staff is </v>

3702
02:58:43.351 --> 02:58:44.190
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no judge,</v>

3703
02:58:44.310 --> 02:58:45.230
<v Speaker 2>there's no effect.</v>

3704
02:58:45.240 --> 02:58:46.590
<v Speaker 2>I've had it before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the worst.</v>

3705
02:58:46.890 --> 02:58:47.970
<v Speaker 2>Your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the worst,</v>

3706
02:58:47.971 --> 02:58:48.804
<v Speaker 2>but it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body goes into a very weakened </v>

3707
02:58:50.671 --> 02:58:51.630
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your,</v>

3708
02:58:51.640 --> 02:58:53.640
<v Speaker 2>you are not the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just not.</v>

3709
02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:54.833
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a real professional and you </v>

3710
02:58:55.870 --> 02:58:57.810
<v Speaker 2>can go out there and do your job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of guys have,</v>

3711
02:58:57.930 --> 02:58:58.763
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys have fought in one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luke rockhold beat Chris Weidman on </v>

3712
02:59:00.781 --> 02:59:02.460
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

3713
02:59:02.640 --> 02:59:05.190
<v Speaker 2>He was fighting off staff when he beat </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris fucking Weidman.</v>

3714
02:59:05.430 --> 02:59:07.890
<v Speaker 2>That's how good Luke rockhold is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys have done it,</v>

3715
02:59:08.220 --> 02:59:09.053
<v Speaker 2>but that's not him at 100% he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted 70 or 80 or whatever the fuck </v>

3716
02:59:13.141 --> 02:59:14.280
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3717
02:59:14.730 --> 02:59:15.563
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Staph infections and antibiotics both </v>

3718
02:59:18.031 --> 02:59:19.200
<v Speaker 2>fuck you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Kevin Lee,</v>

3719
02:59:19.201 --> 02:59:21.930
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opted to not take the antibiotics.</v>

3720
02:59:21.931 --> 02:59:24.810
<v Speaker 2>So after the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he didn't want to weaken the system,</v>

3721
02:59:24.840 --> 02:59:26.310
<v Speaker 2>but he's still weakened by the staff.</v>

3722
02:59:27.030 --> 02:59:31.470
<v Speaker 2>Fuck fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh shoot.</v>

3723
02:59:31.920 --> 02:59:32.753

<v Speaker 2>I'd love to see Steve Bay become a </v>

3734
03:00:04.590 --> 03:00:06.000

3735
03:00:06.240 --> 03:00:08.520
<v Speaker 2>And I think you look at where that guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>is right now.</v>

3736
03:00:08.550 --> 03:00:10.740
<v Speaker 2>Like what is more American than this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy?</v>

3737
