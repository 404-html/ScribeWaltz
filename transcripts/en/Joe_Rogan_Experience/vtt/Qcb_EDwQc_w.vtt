150
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:08.110
<v Speaker 1>which is supposed to be more crazy,</v>

151
00:05:08.111 --> 00:05:09.040
<v Speaker 1>but number one,</v>

152
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 1>I can barely get through with a 35 pound kettle bell.</v>

153
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking ferocious.</v>

154
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>But 45 minutes in,</v>

155
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>you're just ready to die.</v>

156
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:18.341
<v Speaker 1>You can't put,</v>

157
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:20.110

<v Speaker 1>He does it.</v>

160
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>He films it and then cuts.</v>

161
00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.611
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

162
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>But then the fucking video keeps going and then he starts up off fresh.</v>

163
00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Like the dude had a Gatorade,</v>

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.501
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

188

<v Speaker 4>if you haven't seen him,</v>

189
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.791
<v Speaker 4>primal bells,</v>

190
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 4>they're the first in a series of kettle bells that were going to release that</v>

191
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 4>are all art based.</v>

192
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:06.021
<v Speaker 4>It's all,</v>

193
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:09.810
<v Speaker 4>we hired an artist to create some cool things on.</v>

194
00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:10.644
<v Speaker 4>And kettlebells,</v>

195
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.683
<v Speaker 4>we actually,</v>

196
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

197
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.701
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

198
00:06:12.701 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 4>the idea behind it came from,</v>

199
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:15.404
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

200
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.570
<v Speaker 4>another company on the web called Demon Bells.</v>

201
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:18.111
<v Speaker 4>They have it.</v>

202
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 4>And we were like,</v>

203
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

204
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 4>like that you could draw on your weights.</v>

205
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

206
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.341
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

207
00:06:22.341 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 4>you can create art.</v>

208
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.180
<v Speaker 4>And so we hired the special effects designer and uh,</v>

209
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 4>they made this and they made,</v>

210
00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:30.641
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>

211

214
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.400
<v Speaker 4>Angry birds once we've got a whole series of them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

282
00:08:14.001 --> 00:08:19.001
<v Speaker 4>like this is a pageantry involved in promoting a fight and in fucking with</v>

283
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 4>someone's head that you're going to fight and it's,</v>

284
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

285
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 4>people don't like it when other people are better at that aspect of fighting.</v>

286
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.161
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

288
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 4>People get mad if you could talk mad shit about them if they're not good at</v>

289
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:33.110
<v Speaker 4>talking shit back.</v>

290
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:34.011
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

291
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 4>they go into the fight with it like a deficit already.</v>

292
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.683
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of crazy.</v>

293
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.140
<v Speaker 4>It was the culture I was bull open though.</v>

294
00:08:41.141 --> 00:08:41.421
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

295
00:08:41.421 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

296
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.063
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

297
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

298
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 4>banter between teammates at rough house is pretty much bullying.</v>

299
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean it gets pretty serious like to where I'm sure some of the guys go home</v>

300
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 4>and cry after the session,</v>

301
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

302
00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.710
<v Speaker 4>So it's just kind of a natural thing for me.</v>

303
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 4>And then when somebody bites a little</v>

304
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>bit to a comment that I made,</v>

305
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.560
<v Speaker 1>I can't help myself.</v>

306
00:08:58.561 --> 00:08:59.394
<v Speaker 1>It's too much fun.</v>

307
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.743
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

308
00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:02.190
<v Speaker 1>it's very English.</v>

309
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.640
<v Speaker 1>It's very similar to Boston.</v>

310
00:09:03.641 --> 00:09:05.960
<v Speaker 1>And that way Boston has that same like,</v>

311
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.193
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

312
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:12.200
<v Speaker 1>real and insulting style to the trash talk within sports teams and athletes and</v>

313
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>it's just part of the whole thing.</v>

314
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>And some people don't like it.</v>

315
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:19.410
<v Speaker 1>And I could get that.</v>

316
00:09:19.411 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>I get that there's some people want that zen state Anderson Silva approach.</v>

317
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:24.684
<v Speaker 1>We just go in.</v>

318
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>But people forget about Anderson Silva in Abu Dhabi.</v>

319
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 1>They forget when he was,</v>

320
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.470
<v Speaker 1>when he was fighting with Damien Maia talking,</v>

321
00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling them all kinds of shit and Portuguese.</v>

322
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking with that dude's head while he was lighting him up,</v>

323
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

324
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

325
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.460
<v Speaker 1>That's even crazy crap.</v>

326
00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Trash talk.</v>

327
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 1>The trash talk that goes on while you're kicking someone's ass.</v>

328
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching him fight and Lee Marie,</v>

329
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:44.640
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

331
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 1>I was at the side of the cage about fine and the Tony Fryklund one.</v>

332
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude,</v>

333
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>you were there for that.</v>

334
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

335
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.930
<v Speaker 1>People who haven't seen Anderson Silva became Anderson Silva when he went to</v>

336
00:09:57.481 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Japan and when he went to England.</v>

337
00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>But England was really where it all came together for him.</v>

338
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:03.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

339
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 1>like Japan,</v>

340
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:05.780
<v Speaker 1>he got some good fights,</v>

341
00:10:05.781 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 1>but he had some losses.</v>

342
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 1>You know the real tone in he flying.</v>

343
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:09.174
<v Speaker 1>He'll hook.</v>

344
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

345
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean he had some good fights.</v>

346
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

347
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.190
<v Speaker 1>who's that kid who was calling him Alex de bling?</v>

348
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.170
<v Speaker 1>The kid was called himself the Brazilian killer.</v>

349
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Remember they all got pissed off at him.</v>

350
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.793
<v Speaker 1>Anderson,</v>

351
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.121
<v Speaker 1>he beat him.</v>

352
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:21.870
<v Speaker 1>He caught him with a,</v>

353
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.430
<v Speaker 1>with a high kick and then he knocked out Carlos Dude.</v>

354
00:10:24.431 --> 00:10:27.220
<v Speaker 1>And that was probably what's most spectacular fight over there.</v>

355
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:28.210
<v Speaker 1>But he fly in new ones.</v>

356
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

357
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>And it was after Carlos dominated them on the ground.</v>

358
00:10:31.141 --> 00:10:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Carlos is very good,</v>

359
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.930
<v Speaker 1>very advanced at that time.</v>

360
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Like he had like the most advanced ground game of,</v>

361
00:10:36.631 --> 00:10:40.550
<v Speaker 1>of guys that were fighting and high level and he had an Anderson Downhill</v>

362
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Mountain,</v>

363
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.440
<v Speaker 1>him and it did not look,</v>

364
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Eric Anderson was getting up.</v>

365
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

366
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 1>but I think they gave him a yellow card or something like that.</v>

367
00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:47.280
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno how they got stood back up again.</v>

368
00:10:47.281 --> 00:10:48.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what happened,</v>

369
00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:51.060
<v Speaker 1>but they've got stuff back up again and he hit him with a flying knee and</v>

370
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:51.830
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out.</v>

371
00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>And it was after that.</v>

372
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

373
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 1>he got his footing with a couple of good fights,</v>

374
00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't until he went to England and font and cage rage.</v>

375
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.740
<v Speaker 1>That's when he became Anderson Silva.</v>

376
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.970
<v Speaker 1>It was so comfortable.</v>

377
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.873
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

378
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 1>I really felt watching the limb or fight that he could have stopped it.</v>

379
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:07.890
<v Speaker 1>And if any point,</v>

380
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.181
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

381
00:11:08.181 --> 00:11:09.770
<v Speaker 1>you were ready to just kind of told,</v>

382
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:10.561
<v Speaker 1>treat him a little bit,</v>

383
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:11.320
<v Speaker 1>beaten him up.</v>

384
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 1>He was tough.</v>

385
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 1>He was beating the fuck out of Lima.</v>

386
00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

387
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 1>he was fucking his legs up man.</v>

388
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

389
00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:19.290
<v Speaker 1>and Maria is tough as shit.</v>

390
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:20.730
<v Speaker 1>He hung in there man,</v>

391
00:11:20.731 --> 00:11:21.610
<v Speaker 1>the entire time.</v>

392
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.060
<v Speaker 1>38 times though.</v>

393
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 1>So it was training.</v>

394
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Six weeks later he made a video about him hitting the mid six weeks later,</v>

395
00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:27.610
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

396
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:29.220
<v Speaker 1>if people don't know who we're talking about,</v>

397
00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:34.221
<v Speaker 1>this guy is like really a legitimate folk lore type character.</v>

398
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.560
<v Speaker 1>He's like Guy Ritchie movie character.</v>

399
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:35.701
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

400
00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:39.580
<v Speaker 1>he and he's almost greater than a guy Ritchie character because you wouldn't</v>

401
00:11:39.581 --> 00:11:44.581
<v Speaker 1>ever believe a Guy Ritchie character really could be like a top MMA fighter and</v>

402
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:49.671
<v Speaker 1>also one of the greatest armed robbery suspects in the history of the universe</v>

403
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.611
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

404
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:51.211
<v Speaker 1>He's pretty crazy.</v>

405
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 1>I remember sitting in traffic on the way to cage rage.</v>

406
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

407
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

408
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 6>pulled daily in the car and uh,</v>

409
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 6>like stuck in traffic but not far from the arena and Lemuria just racing up the</v>

410
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:01.740
<v Speaker 6>hard shoulder and he's,</v>

411
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.411
<v Speaker 6>and he's a,</v>

412
00:12:02.411 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a BMW s like 70 miles an hour.</v>

413
00:12:05.531 --> 00:12:06.364
<v Speaker 6>Just,</v>

414
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 6>he was crazy.</v>

415
00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.410
<v Speaker 6>Did you see him following that with Matt Lindland after that fight?</v>

416
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.090
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

417
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 6>Lindland for a cage rage and they brought Marie into kind of hype up a fight</v>

418
00:12:13.991 --> 00:12:14.824
<v Speaker 6>between the two.</v>

419
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

420
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.260
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] your fucking mind key.</v>

421
00:12:18.261 --> 00:12:19.780
<v Speaker 6>You're a lot like a fucking monkey.</v>

422
00:12:19.781 --> 00:12:21.520
<v Speaker 6>There was Matt Lindland was just,</v>

423
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.990
<v Speaker 6>he didn't even think it was real.</v>

424
00:12:22.991 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>

425
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:24.423
<v Speaker 6>it was pretty hilarious.</v>

426
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.160
<v Speaker 6>The more he's like throwing stuff at him while he was real.</v>

427
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.151
<v Speaker 6>He just really,</v>

428
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:28.961
<v Speaker 6>was that crazy?</v>

429
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

430
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.720
<v Speaker 6>There's every now and then a dude comes along like that.</v>

431
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.410
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

432
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

433
00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:35.250
<v Speaker 6>we're lucky that he didn't come along and like,</v>

434
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 6>like the dark ages,</v>

435

<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

436
00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.330
<v Speaker 6>I mean he would have showed the web people like him.</v>

437
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.011
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

438
00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:46.011
<v Speaker 1>there were that guy would have had like the scariest gang ever back when there</v>

439
00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:47.250
<v Speaker 1>was like very little rules.</v>

440
00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:48.600
<v Speaker 1>You can have swords and shit.</v>

441
00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh my goodness.</v>

442
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:50.891
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

443
00:12:50.891 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 6>It'll run like a bunch of outliers in a forest.</v>

444
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:53.951
<v Speaker 1>You got to think,</v>

445
00:12:53.951 --> 00:12:54.250
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

446
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.950
<v Speaker 1>that time in our lives in the,</v>

447
00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.150
<v Speaker 1>for the human race,</v>

448
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 1>that was only like a thousand years ago.</v>

449
00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.630
<v Speaker 1>That's not that long ago,</v>

450
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:02.250
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

451
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like medieval shit.</v>

452
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Long ago.</v>

453
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.873
<v Speaker 1>That's so,</v>

454
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 1>so recent.</v>

455
00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:09.700
<v Speaker 1>The DNA is still there,</v>

456
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:14.730
<v Speaker 1>public beheadings and every now and then he gets some straight lineage type</v>

457
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

458
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:20.220
<v Speaker 1>You get a dude who just has basically barbarian means and he's walking amongst</v>

459
00:13:20.531 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>regular folks here in 2013 he just,</v>

460
00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:25.800
<v Speaker 1>he's not playing by any rule.</v>

461
00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:27.220
<v Speaker 1>She's got no rules.</v>

462
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:30.250
<v Speaker 1>He's just going for it until he hits a wall,</v>

463
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.500
<v Speaker 1>just full clip until he hits a wall.</v>

464
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>It's important to know that it's possible that a guy like that could exist and</v>

465
00:13:37.091 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>people get romantic about it and upset,</v>

466
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 1>but you could not get upset about it today.</v>

467
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:42.461
<v Speaker 1>You can got knocked,</v>

468
00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>get romantic about it till you could,</v>

469
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:43.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

470
00:13:43.841 --> 00:13:44.081
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

471
00:13:44.081 --> 00:13:44.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

472
00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:44.471
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

473
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you're glorifying something that you're glorifying something pathetic and it</v>

474
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:48.311
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

475
00:13:48.311 --> 00:13:50.770
<v Speaker 1>if this guy inspires other kids to live that way,</v>

476
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:52.210
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

477
00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.460
<v Speaker 1>But make no mistake about it a hundred years from now,</v>

478
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:55.540
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be an awesome story.</v>

479
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:56.051
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

480
00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:57.790
<v Speaker 1>200 years ago when you're not connected.</v>

481
00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

482
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.750
<v Speaker 1>From now,</v>

483
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 1>like when we're not connected to it emotionally.</v>

484
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.340
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be an awesome</v>

485
00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:01.970
<v Speaker 6>story.</v>

486
00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 6>But we studied these people now though.</v>

487
00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:04.370
<v Speaker 6>I mean look at like a,</v>

488
00:14:04.371 --> 00:14:05.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

489
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.420
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

490
00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:09.980
<v Speaker 6>like Branson or a lot of folks don't know that documentary.</v>

491
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.300
<v Speaker 6>The Bronson documentary.</v>

492
00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:12.111
<v Speaker 6>It was really weird.</v>

493
00:14:12.111 --> 00:14:12.620
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

494
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:14.060
<v Speaker 6>Chopper was really weird too.</v>

495
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.410
<v Speaker 6>But those are there,</v>

496
00:14:15.411 --> 00:14:17.200
<v Speaker 6>those kinds of people like Lemur.</v>

497
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:18.830
<v Speaker 6>He's got to have a movie made about him.</v>

498
00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:19.531
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

499
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

500
00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:21.083
<v Speaker 1>Unquestionably.</v>

501
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.560
<v Speaker 1>And he could fucking fight,</v>

502
00:14:22.561 --> 00:14:22.890
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

503
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:23.723
<v Speaker 1>He could fight.</v>

504
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I saw him a fight.</v>

505
00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Amir Renova rd starched him,</v>

506
00:14:27.611 --> 00:14:28.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

507
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.910
<v Speaker 1>It was so ruthless.</v>

508
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.370
<v Speaker 1>His right hand was fucking nasty.</v>

509
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.870
<v Speaker 1>He was really,</v>

510
00:14:33.871 --> 00:14:34.501
<v Speaker 1>really sharp.</v>

511
00:14:34.501 --> 00:14:35.334
<v Speaker 1>Stryker,</v>

512
00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:36.390
<v Speaker 1>really powerful guy.</v>

513
00:14:36.391 --> 00:14:38.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean he wasn't like the most technical guy,</v>

514
00:14:38.011 --> 00:14:39.600
<v Speaker 1>which is where Andy should pick them apart.</v>

515
00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:40.380
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

516
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.790
<v Speaker 1>He was such fast hands though.</v>

517
00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.400
<v Speaker 1>He was very fast and very confident,</v>

518
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:45.510
<v Speaker 1>very confident.</v>

519
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.240
<v Speaker 1>You know it took a guy like Anderson to sort of pick them apart.</v>

520
00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:52.300
<v Speaker 1>A guy who just was clearly Anderson's on some nothing.</v>

521
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 1>He's not some next level in like every department.</v>

522
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah he's on some next level physical shit.</v>

523
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 1>He's up some next level mental shit.</v>

524
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.190
<v Speaker 1>He's on some next level of confidence shit.</v>

525
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:03.140
<v Speaker 1>He's on some next level success shit.</v>

526
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 1>He really feels like he's magic.</v>

527
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 1>He feels like he can go in there and just do shit to people but he can,</v>

528
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.470
<v Speaker 1>he can.</v>

529
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:09.140
<v Speaker 1>He does.</v>

530
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

531
00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.240
<v Speaker 1>So He's like that.</v>

532
00:15:11.241 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>It takes a guy like that to do that until a guy like Lee Marie,</v>

533
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>you know a guy like when when you see Anderson like at its best is one of the</v>

534
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>weirdest things cause you can't believe a guy can do what he just did.</v>

535
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:23.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

536
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.120
<v Speaker 1>like when he fucked up when we were there in Brazil and he fought Stephan Bonner</v>

537
00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.593
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

538
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.501
<v Speaker 1>that was like,</v>

539
00:15:30.501 --> 00:15:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a movie.</v>

540
00:15:31.521 --> 00:15:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

541
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 1>It was like the guy just put his back to the cage and let him tee off on them</v>

542
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.580
<v Speaker 1>and then brought him back in,</v>

543
00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:39.410
<v Speaker 1>got to the center and brought them right back in,</v>

544
00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:40.940
<v Speaker 1>puts his hands down,</v>

545
00:15:40.941 --> 00:15:42.170
<v Speaker 1>stands right in front of them,</v>

546
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.270
<v Speaker 1>and then when he decides to strike,</v>

547
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 1>throws him to the ground and buries him with one knee and you're like Jesus.</v>

548
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 1>But it was like the Forrest Griffin fight though.</v>

549
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.500
<v Speaker 1>He'd been baiting him to like,</v>

550
00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.790
<v Speaker 1>like overextend on his punches all the way through the round.</v>

551
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.800
<v Speaker 1>And then as soon as he did it and crossed his feet,</v>

552
00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.020
<v Speaker 1>he just seems surreal.</v>

553
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

554
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:01.460
<v Speaker 1>he's a master.</v>

555
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 1>He's a real master.</v>

556
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.270
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a kind of an honor to be around witnessing it live.</v>

557
00:16:05.271 --> 00:16:06.104
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

558
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

559
00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:06.981
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

560
00:16:06.981 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 1>It's an honor to be able to call it for short.</v>

561
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

562
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.460
<v Speaker 1>it's really shocking.</v>

563
00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.400
<v Speaker 1>His abilities are very shocking,</v>

564
00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:13.971
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

565
00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:17.630
<v Speaker 1>one day we're going to look back at him and we're going to look at some new guy.</v>

566
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:18.321
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

567
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:21.410
<v Speaker 1>the way people used to look at Sugar Ray Robinson and Roy Jones Jr.</v>

568
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

569
00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:21.981
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

570
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Ray Robinson was amazing,</v>

571
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.720
<v Speaker 1>but I think Roy Jones Jr in his prime would've lit them up with like a Christmas</v>

572
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:27.110
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

573
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would have even been able to fuck with him.</v>

574
00:16:29.151 --> 00:16:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Like he wouldn't have been able to find him.</v>

575
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:31.630
<v Speaker 1>But I look at Mayweather.</v>

576
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

577
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.150
<v Speaker 1>As much as I disliked the guy.</v>

578
00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful boxer.</v>

579
00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful Roy.</v>

580
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>The problem with Roy was all that John Ruiz fight.</v>

581
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.950
<v Speaker 1>He went up and wait in one heavyweight fight.</v>

582
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 1>That documentary was good though.</v>

583
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:44.611
<v Speaker 1>Did you watch it?</v>

584
00:16:44.611 --> 00:16:45.120
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

585
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 1>The documentary I am writing for that.</v>

586
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:47.391

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:48.710
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

590
00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.790
<v Speaker 1>it was really interesting.</v>

591

<v Speaker 1>It got this little old white dude doing all of these uh,</v>

00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:56.691

599
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.680
<v Speaker 1>Let me see if I can pull it up.</v>

600
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.330
<v Speaker 1>He's the guy who trained,</v>

601
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:03.233
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

602
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.280
<v Speaker 1>he trained,</v>

603
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

604
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Spinks Michael Spinks for is heavyweight fights with Larry Holmes.</v>

605
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.090
<v Speaker 1>And then again for Tyson I think.</v>

606
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.113
<v Speaker 1>Huh.</v>

607
00:17:12.590 --> 00:17:13.423
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

608
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I remember watching a,</v>

609
00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:15.920
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the,</v>

610
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the HBO shows tone at one of the HBO shows with the Roy Jones prepare for</v>

611
00:17:20.901 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>a fight.</v>

612
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:23.630
<v Speaker 1>And it was when I was training the legends and there was this,</v>

613
00:17:23.631 --> 00:17:27.520
<v Speaker 1>this shot where he was training to run DMC and he's like doing any ShutterBox</v>

614
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.610
<v Speaker 1>into the rhythm of the music.</v>

615
00:17:28.611 --> 00:17:33.611
<v Speaker 1>So I was immediately downloaded run DMC and started doing it at the gym legend.</v>

616
00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

617
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:37.243
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

618
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:37.521
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

619
00:17:37.521 --> 00:17:38.870
<v Speaker 1>he worked with Roy Jones.</v>

620
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

621
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.220
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

622
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.310
<v Speaker 1>he was an interesting card.</v>

623
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Said well it's interesting because what happened was then Roy,</v>

624
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.300
<v Speaker 1>he looks spectacular in the Ruiz fight,</v>

625
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:51.050
<v Speaker 1>but then he drops down to fight Antonio Tarver his to lose a lot of ways.</v>

626
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

627
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's a 205 pound,</v>

628
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 1>206 pound guy now.</v>

629
00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was a small heavyweight,</v>

630
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:57.360
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's still,</v>

631
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.740
<v Speaker 1>he got above 200 pounds,</v>

632
00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:01.950
<v Speaker 1>which to drop all the way the fuck down to one 75 again,</v>

633
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.360
<v Speaker 1>that is a big deal.</v>

634
00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:03.870
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

635
00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 1>It's way easier to talk your body and to getting bigger than it is to talk to</v>

636
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:08.510
<v Speaker 1>you about and to getting smaller.</v>

637
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

638
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.200
<v Speaker 1>Like you have to fucking starve yourself,</v>

639
00:18:10.201 --> 00:18:13.740
<v Speaker 1>especially in a sport like boxing where you've got to continuously work for a</v>

640
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:14.574
<v Speaker 1>long period of time.</v>

641
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:15.331
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 1>He looked completely different in that fight physically.</v>

643
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Like his body looked deflated,</v>

644
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:21.263
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

645
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:22.530
<v Speaker 1>cutting weight like that.</v>

646
00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.000
<v Speaker 1>It just ruined him.</v>

647
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 1>And then he got knocked out by Tarver and then he got knocked out again,</v>

648
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:30.570
<v Speaker 1>even scarier by Glenn Johnson and those,</v>

649
00:18:30.571 --> 00:18:31.381
<v Speaker 1>those fights,</v>

650
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:36.381
<v Speaker 1>I think direct result of him weakening himself to drop down to 175 pounds or a</v>

651
00:18:38.491 --> 00:18:43.491
<v Speaker 1>direct result also of whatever the fuck he took to get up to 200 plus pounds not</v>

652
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:45.330
<v Speaker 1>being in the system anymore.</v>

653
00:18:45.331 --> 00:18:46.980
<v Speaker 1>And his system crashes,</v>

654
00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 1>which is what happens,</v>

655
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're like in your late thirties yeah.</v>

656
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:51.501
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

657
00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 1>you're a pro athlete who's getting head trauma on a regular basis?</v>

658
00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Well those were all things designed to lower your testosterone.</v>

659
00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.293
<v Speaker 1>All of those things,</v>

660
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

661
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.450
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like nature has it set up like you're going to get hit in the head</v>

662
00:19:03.451 --> 00:19:07.290
<v Speaker 1>so many times for it just start slow the fuck down bitch.</v>

663
00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ like literally slows down your testosterone from head trauma.</v>

664
00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:11.881
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

665
00:19:11.881 --> 00:19:11.991
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

666
00:19:11.991 --> 00:19:15.210
<v Speaker 1>we got to figure out a way to stop getting hit in the head and maybe this</v>

667
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.230
<v Speaker 1>asshole to add row nature doesn't know that.</v>

668
00:19:19.231 --> 00:19:21.120
<v Speaker 1>You've got to fucking fight and career to think about.</v>

669
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

670
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I hated watching him fight cows.</v>

671
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Aggie.</v>

672
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

673
00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Did you like how's that guy?</v>

674
00:19:26.741 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Either and they was just,</v>

675
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:29.010
<v Speaker 1>it was just rough to watch.</v>

676
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.450
<v Speaker 1>He's a shell of himself.</v>

677
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:31.620
<v Speaker 1>He's a shell of himself.</v>

678
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think cows,</v>

679
00:19:32.841 --> 00:19:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I could have hung with Roy and when Roy was in his prime,</v>

680
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:37.440
<v Speaker 1>when Roy fought Vinny Pazienza,</v>

681
00:19:37.441 --> 00:19:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it was the first fight ever recorded where the opponent did not land a single</v>

682
00:19:42.031 --> 00:19:42.864
<v Speaker 1>punch.</v>

683
00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 1>He went through a whole round boxing with Vinny Pazienza when patsy Hans was in</v>

684
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:48.960
<v Speaker 1>its prime.</v>

685
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.960
<v Speaker 1>And pass the hands of swinging for fucking fences and get nothing for a whole</v>

686
00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:54.924
<v Speaker 1>round.</v>

687
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

688
00:19:55.441 --> 00:19:56.430
<v Speaker 1>that's insane.</v>

689
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:57.010
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

690
00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 1>you're in the both punch in and this guy hits you 60 times and you hit him zero.</v>

691
00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.460
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

692
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Should we should get Anderson Silva to break that record,</v>

693
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 1>like number of punches based that around us.</v>

694
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>

695
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.180
<v Speaker 1>what you need with an Anderson Silva,</v>

696
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.660
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need a Roy Jones type dude to beat Anderson Silva.</v>

697
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.410
<v Speaker 1>You're going to need a guy who's got that kind of,</v>

698
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.930
<v Speaker 1>but with Moy Tai it,</v>

699
00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:18.870
<v Speaker 1>those guys are out there.</v>

700
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:19.081
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

701
00:20:19.081 --> 00:20:19.914
<v Speaker 1>they're out there.</v>

702
00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.210
<v Speaker 1>They just got to put it together.</v>

703
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.340
<v Speaker 1>We all knew like you,</v>

704
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.920
<v Speaker 1>you came up doing martial arts like a good portion of your life,</v>

705
00:20:25.921 --> 00:20:26.754
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

706
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.460
<v Speaker 1>So you must've went to like karate tournament is a solid,</v>

707
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:33.600
<v Speaker 1>those few young kids that weren't super talented where everybody was like God</v>

708
00:20:33.601 --> 00:20:34.180
<v Speaker 1>damn,</v>

709
00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:35.850
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes they never come to fruition.</v>

710
00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

711
00:20:36.061 --> 00:20:39.360
<v Speaker 1>they never become the martial arts legends that they could have been.</v>

712
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:42.600
<v Speaker 1>In my experience without the people that find it that easy and pick it up that</v>

713
00:20:42.601 --> 00:20:42.961
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

714
00:20:42.961 --> 00:20:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Usually you usually lose interest.</v>

715
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:46.920
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of frustrating.</v>

716
00:20:46.921 --> 00:20:48.220
<v Speaker 1>There's a very few that stick</v>

717
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.670
<v Speaker 6>with it and that's when you get someone like Anderson Silva or John Jones.</v>

718
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

719
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:58.050
<v Speaker 6>There's those guys who have that lethal combination of like dedication and that</v>

720
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:01.510
<v Speaker 6>freaks skill and freak bodies.</v>

721
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:03.370
<v Speaker 6>Man Do some freak shit.</v>

722
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.413
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

723
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 6>There's certain dudes,</v>

724
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:05.771
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>

725
00:21:05.771 --> 00:21:07.780
<v Speaker 6>John Jones can do some freak shit to people,</v>

726
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.561
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

727
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:09.400
<v Speaker 6>like he can,</v>

728
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 6>he's spitting elbows.</v>

729
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:11.620
<v Speaker 6>People in the head,</v>

730
00:21:11.621 --> 00:21:12.580
<v Speaker 6>he's giant.</v>

731
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:13.580
<v Speaker 6>You can't get ahold of them.</v>

732
00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:15.520
<v Speaker 6>He out wrestled [inaudible] though any,</v>

733
00:21:15.521 --> 00:21:16.354
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

734
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:17.530
<v Speaker 6>I can't imagine,</v>

735
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.770
<v Speaker 6>I can't imagine throwing any strike home that wouldn't hit something sharp.</v>

736
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.050
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't mean it'd be like kicking a bag of ranches.</v>

737
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.913
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

738
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.500
<v Speaker 6>He's fucking scary dude.</v>

739
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:27.640
<v Speaker 6>Scary right now.</v>

740
00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.950
<v Speaker 6>He's on this next level,</v>

741
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:33.100
<v Speaker 6>scary shit right now where he's just dis like so confident.</v>

742
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 6>Just like the science,</v>

743
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:34.481
<v Speaker 6>the mall,</v>

744
00:21:34.481 --> 00:21:35.081
<v Speaker 6>chill son.</v>

745
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 6>And he's like 15</v>

746
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.500
<v Speaker 6>I think he just turned 24 25 okay.</v>

747
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:41.561
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

748
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:41.920
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

749
00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.870
<v Speaker 6>it is a young man's game.</v>

750
00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

751
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:45.281
<v Speaker 6>What is the,</v>

752
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:48.340
<v Speaker 6>this condition that pulled you out of your next fight?</v>

753
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.090
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

754
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.960
<v Speaker 6>the wolf hot thing.</v>

755
00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.010
<v Speaker 6>What is it called?</v>

756
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.390
<v Speaker 6>Like a baboon heart.</v>

757
00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:52.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

758
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:53.111
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

759
00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:53.950
<v Speaker 6>It's exactly the same.</v>

760
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:54.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

761
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:55.063
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

762
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 6>What is,</v>

763
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.041
<v Speaker 6>what is,</v>

764
00:21:57.041 --> 00:21:57.760
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

765
00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:58.593
<v Speaker 6>what does it mean?</v>

766
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.970
<v Speaker 6>It's called Wolff Parkinson White Syndrome.</v>

767
00:22:00.971 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 6>But I didn't have the syndrome because I've never had any symptoms.</v>

768
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:05.110
<v Speaker 6>I only have pattern,</v>

769
00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.270
<v Speaker 6>which means that I ha I have a second heartbeat,</v>

770
00:22:07.271 --> 00:22:09.370
<v Speaker 6>but it's not never caused a problem.</v>

771
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 6>You have a second heartbeat.</v>

772
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:10.901
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

773
00:22:10.901 --> 00:22:11.710
<v Speaker 6>Well basically,</v>

774
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.841
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

775
00:22:11.841 --> 00:22:12.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

776
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:14.770
<v Speaker 6>in the center of your heart you've got like the regular pacemaker is a bunch of</v>

777
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:17.960
<v Speaker 6>skills that a bunch of cells that um,</v>

778
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.530
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

779
00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.290
<v Speaker 6>they create electrical impulse to,</v>

780
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 6>to keep the heart beating.</v>

781
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 6>And with WPW people have,</v>

782
00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:24.120
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

783
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.300
<v Speaker 6>other cells in the upper parts of the hall that did the same thing.</v>

784
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.430
<v Speaker 6>And usually what they would do is they go in,</v>

785
00:22:30.431 --> 00:22:31.300
<v Speaker 6>it's called an ablation.</v>

786
00:22:31.301 --> 00:22:35.890
<v Speaker 6>They kind of go into the femoral artery and they can burn them out and stuff.</v>

787
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:37.010
<v Speaker 6>But that's,</v>

788
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.530
<v Speaker 6>but people will have that done when they,</v>

789
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.700
<v Speaker 6>when they have like symptoms,</v>

790
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:39.881
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

791
00:22:39.881 --> 00:22:43.180
<v Speaker 6>when they have like palpitations or dizziness and like people have panic attacks</v>

792
00:22:43.181 --> 00:22:43.900
<v Speaker 6>and stuff.</v>

793
00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.100
<v Speaker 6>I've never had anything.</v>

794
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.180
<v Speaker 6>Nothing at all.</v>

795
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:48.160
<v Speaker 6>So what,</v>

796
00:22:48.161 --> 00:22:49.660
<v Speaker 6>that's what they're telling me at the moment.</v>

797
00:22:49.661 --> 00:22:49.811
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

798
00:22:49.811 --> 00:22:50.950
<v Speaker 6>I've got to go back and get some,</v>

799
00:22:51.030 --> 00:22:51.590
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

800
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.190
<v Speaker 6>some more tests done for like a second opinion with a different person.</v>

801
00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:55.653
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

802
00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:57.080
<v Speaker 6>but basically what the,</v>

803
00:22:57.081 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 6>what the way I understand it right now is if I want to continue fighting to get</v>

804
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:01.271
<v Speaker 6>cleared,</v>

805
00:23:01.271 --> 00:23:02.410
<v Speaker 6>I have to have the ablation.</v>

806
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 6>But because I've never had any symptoms and I'm perfectly fine,</v>

807
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:10.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't see the point in letting someone go in and start burning my shit.</v>

808
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.520
<v Speaker 6>And that doesn't sound,</v>

809
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.970
<v Speaker 6>that sounds like something they were probably not going to do in five years.</v>

810
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:16.901
<v Speaker 6>They're going to go,</v>

811
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:19.440
<v Speaker 6>well back when we used to go in there and burn it out,</v>

812
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.720
<v Speaker 6>we realized that's actually a mistake that was actually,</v>

813
00:23:22.721 --> 00:23:23.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

814
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.980
<v Speaker 6>the human body figured it out and everything was cool and running smooth and we</v>

815
00:23:26.981 --> 00:23:27.880
<v Speaker 6>were being ridiculous.</v>

816
00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:28.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

817
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:28.541
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

818
00:23:28.541 --> 00:23:31.240
<v Speaker 6>if it was causing that problem and that's the solution,</v>

819
00:23:31.241 --> 00:23:32.021
<v Speaker 6>then I would have it done.</v>

820
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:32.580
<v Speaker 6>But it's not.</v>

821
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.370
<v Speaker 6>So their concern is that if they license you and this,</v>

822
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:37.840
<v Speaker 6>this is a potential issue,</v>

823
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:38.590
<v Speaker 6>a health issue,</v>

824
00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:39.070
<v Speaker 6>while those,</v>

825
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.080
<v Speaker 6>there was that soccer player a few years ago,</v>

826
00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:43.840
<v Speaker 6>I think you play flight Chelsea or something and he had a heart attack on the</v>

827
00:23:43.841 --> 00:23:44.501
<v Speaker 6>pitch and died.</v>

828
00:23:44.501 --> 00:23:45.840
<v Speaker 6>He was like 28.</v>

829
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

830
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:48.230
<v Speaker 6>I'm basically,</v>

831
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:49.460
<v Speaker 6>the problem is that the,</v>

832
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.880
<v Speaker 6>the main heart rate can only go up to about 220 beats a minute.</v>

833
00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.920
<v Speaker 6>But the secondary cells that produce a a,</v>

834
00:23:55.930 --> 00:24:00.110
<v Speaker 6>the second heart rate or the heartbeat is that's limitless that can go to,</v>

835
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.101
<v Speaker 6>to whatever.</v>

836
00:24:01.101 --> 00:24:01.700
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

837
00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:02.300
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

838
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.750
<v Speaker 6>like if I'm at 12 minutes into the fight and I'm full of adrenaline and</v>

839
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.870
<v Speaker 6>completely exhausted and my heart rate can't keep up,</v>

840
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.510
<v Speaker 6>there's a potential for the other one to kind of take over,</v>

841
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.030
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

842
00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:13.970
<v Speaker 6>and he'd give you a hard time.</v>

843
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:14.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

844
00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 6>But it,</v>

845
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.381
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

846
00:24:15.381 --> 00:24:20.381
<v Speaker 6>the chances decrease after 25 and the chance of it happening is like 0.6%.</v>

847
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.851
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

848
00:24:22.851 --> 00:24:23.340
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

849
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

850
00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Well do you also have like a really low resting heart rate?</v>

851
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.420
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

852
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:27.610
<v Speaker 6>42 that's very,</v>

853
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.640
<v Speaker 6>it was when I got the tests.</v>

854
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.640
<v Speaker 6>Michael Bisping's is like 34.</v>

855
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:32.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

856
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.043
<v Speaker 6>That's insane.</v>

857
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:34.551
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible,</v>

858
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:35.000
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

859
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.020
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to feed his brain.</v>

860
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:36.854
<v Speaker 6>They don't forget.</v>

861
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:41.771
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

862
00:24:41.771 --> 00:24:43.990
<v Speaker 4>you didn't basically knows.</v>

863
00:24:43.991 --> 00:24:44.824
<v Speaker 4>I'm kidding.</v>

864
00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:48.160
<v Speaker 4>He might have like the lowest rate working heart rate,</v>

865
00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.300
<v Speaker 4>the resting heart rate of anybody in the UFC.</v>

866
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.393
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

867
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:52.713
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 6>of making him an MMA star because he had this natural ability and he is,</v>

928
00:26:16.181 --> 00:26:18.640
<v Speaker 4>heals up and has exactly the same style.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The next fight.</v>

930
00:26:19.061 --> 00:26:19.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

932
00:26:20.861 --> 00:26:21.694
<v Speaker 4>And then</v>

933
00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.220
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of that shit out there,</v>

937
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:27.393
<v Speaker 4>It's out there.</v>

938
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.421
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

939
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:28.840
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

940
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.770
<v Speaker 4>what are you going to do now?</v>

941
00:26:29.771 --> 00:26:30.604
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

942
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:31.640
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

943
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.001
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

944
00:26:32.001 --> 00:26:33.610
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to go back and get some,</v>

945
00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:34.580
<v Speaker 6>some more tests done.</v>

946
00:26:34.581 --> 00:26:35.211
<v Speaker 6>Lorenzo has,</v>

947
00:26:35.211 --> 00:26:35.410
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

948
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.640
<v Speaker 6>a special cardiologist that he wants me to go and see,</v>

949
00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:39.010
<v Speaker 6>so I'm going to get that done and uh,</v>

950
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:40.580
<v Speaker 6>just kind of see what my options are.</v>

951
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:41.420
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

952
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 6>I don't see the point in having a surgery done if I,</v>

953
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.020
<v Speaker 4>if I have to have it done to carry on fighting.</v>

954
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:47.670
<v Speaker 4>It seems scary.</v>

955
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 4>It just seems pointless to me.</v>

956
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:49.831
<v Speaker 4>Especially because,</v>

957
00:26:49.831 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

958
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.180
<v Speaker 4>like is it risky?</v>

959
00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

960
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.840
<v Speaker 4>the problem is that they don't know whereabouts in my heart it is.</v>

961
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:55.081
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

962
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:55.914
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>

963
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:57.150
<v Speaker 4>I think gotta go look,</v>

964
00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.021
<v Speaker 4>I'll look for it.</v>

965
00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:00.240
<v Speaker 4>So they didn't say they could fix it or they said they wanted to study it.</v>

966
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:01.883
<v Speaker 4>They want to study it.</v>

967
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:04.620
<v Speaker 4>I study and they wanted to study this for weeks before the fight,</v>

968
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.620
<v Speaker 4>so they wanted me to go in and have uh,</v>

969
00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 4>something put up the inside archery at both my legs and wanting to my neck so</v>

970
00:27:12.091 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 4>they can go in and try and find it.</v>

971
00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.690
<v Speaker 4>They put you under while you're doing this.</v>

972
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:15.533
<v Speaker 4>Are you just chilling?</v>

973
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:17.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>

974
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:18.301

975
00:27:18.301 --> 00:27:19.820
<v Speaker 4>Hardee how's that possible?</v>

976
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.720
<v Speaker 4>You just lie in there.</v>

977
00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:22.590
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

978
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.910
<v Speaker 4>that's just not cool.</v>

979
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

980
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.320
<v Speaker 4>that is so not cool.</v>

981
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.070
<v Speaker 4>So the guy was like,</v>

982
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.191
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

983
00:27:26.191 --> 00:27:27.600
<v Speaker 4>so we'll do that and if we can find it,</v>

984
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:29.430
<v Speaker 4>we can fix it and then you'll be able to,</v>

985
00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:29.701
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

986
00:27:29.701 --> 00:27:31.290
<v Speaker 4>take a week off and then go back to training.</v>

987
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:32.580
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck?</v>

988
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:38.180
<v Speaker 4>You could just chill while they send these like wire worms up your arteries or</v>

989
00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.590
<v Speaker 4>peek inside your fucking heart.</v>

990

<v Speaker 4>My Dad said get that thing up his penis hole when like when he turned a certain</v>

991
00:27:44.881 --> 00:27:45.181

1014
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:27.300
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem with me know.</v>

1015
00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:27.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.880
<v Speaker 4>He really talked himself into some great situations.</v>

1017
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.800
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1018
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.540
<v Speaker 4>he's the best shit talker ever.</v>

1019
00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.040
<v Speaker 4>He's exciting to watch.</v>

1020
00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.320
<v Speaker 4>I love like interviewing him in a way in,</v>

1021
00:28:37.321 --> 00:28:39.330
<v Speaker 4>because I know he's going to say some crazy shit.</v>

1022
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1023
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:39.870
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1024
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.630
<v Speaker 4>that's the kind of shit it's going to go down in history,</v>

1025
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.090
<v Speaker 4>this thing.</v>

1026
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:42.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1027
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 4>I always remember one line and he said when he was preparing for a Anderson,</v>

1028
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:48.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure which time it was,</v>

1029
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:48.834
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>

1030
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:49.800
<v Speaker 4>here's the champion,</v>

1031
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:50.850
<v Speaker 4>but I am the best.</v>

1032
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1033
00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:52.590
<v Speaker 4>that's a great line.</v>

1034
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:53.801
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1035
00:28:53.801 --> 00:28:55.410
<v Speaker 4>I want to use that every day at some point.</v>

1036
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1037
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.810
<v Speaker 4>and he's so good.</v>

1038
00:28:57.811 --> 00:29:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Even after he loses in insulin,</v>

1039
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.590
<v Speaker 4>another fight like that,</v>

1040
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:06.560
<v Speaker 4>just think about what happened to dude got starched by Anderson Silva and then</v>

1041
00:29:06.561 --> 00:29:07.111
<v Speaker 4>he says,</v>

1042
00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:07.944
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1043
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Silva is only the beginning.</v>

1044
00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.510
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go after the light heavyweight champion.</v>

1045
00:29:12.511 --> 00:29:14.130
<v Speaker 4>And like all the sudden he's fighting the light,</v>

1046
00:29:14.131 --> 00:29:14.964
<v Speaker 4>every champion.</v>

1047
00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1048
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.680
<v Speaker 4>he goes from losing a shot at the middleweight belt to fighting for the light</v>

1049
00:29:19.681 --> 00:29:20.514
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight belt.</v>

1050
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.151
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1051
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:21.984
<v Speaker 4>that's impressive.</v>

1052
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.241
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1053
00:29:22.241 --> 00:29:23.460
<v Speaker 4>it was in Dana is like,</v>

1054
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.660
<v Speaker 4>he's the one who asked for that fight.</v>

1055
00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.600
<v Speaker 4>Like I understand that he is a politician.</v>

1056
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:28.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1057
00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:29.191
<v Speaker 4>I understand that.</v>

1058
00:29:29.191 --> 00:29:30.360
<v Speaker 4>He's the one that asked for that fight.</v>

1059
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:31.501
<v Speaker 4>But that's a,</v>

1060
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:32.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1061
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.680
<v Speaker 4>you got to respect the guy's ability to sell shit.</v>

1062
00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.490
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1063
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.290
<v Speaker 4>he can sell a fucking paper view,</v>

1064
00:29:37.291 --> 00:29:37.880
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1065
00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.830
<v Speaker 4>I mean the dude just lost to Anderson Silva and there was white people all over</v>

1066
00:29:41.831 --> 00:29:42.310
<v Speaker 4>the world</v>

1067
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.690
<v Speaker 1>convinced that he had a shot.</v>

1068
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1069
00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:45.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.290
<v Speaker 1>There was white people all over the world.</v>

1071
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.650
<v Speaker 1>It was looking forward to him winning,</v>

1072
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1073
00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:52.500
<v Speaker 1>he started,</v>

1074
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.333
<v Speaker 1>what a character,</v>

1075
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.213
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>

1076
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.840
<v Speaker 1>what a funny smart guy.</v>

1077
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.290
<v Speaker 1>He's the kind of guy that could knock on your door at like 8:00 AM and you're</v>

1078
00:29:59.291 --> 00:29:59.441
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1079
00:29:59.441 --> 00:30:02.860
<v Speaker 1>you wake up by battle all outside and shit and then he's selling his time.</v>

1080
00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Makes the door and you bought three vacuum platelets.</v>

1081
00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:07.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1082
00:30:07.001 --> 00:30:07.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1083
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:09.040
<v Speaker 1>but he can fight too,</v>

1084
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:09.410
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1085
00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:10.243
<v Speaker 1>He can fight.</v>

1086
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:11.740
<v Speaker 1>It's just he's,</v>

1087
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:15.190
<v Speaker 1>he ran into to buzz saws to the,</v>

1088
00:30:15.191 --> 00:30:18.790
<v Speaker 1>the greatest fighters of the generation and Anderson and mean look what he did</v>

1089
00:30:18.791 --> 00:30:21.130
<v Speaker 1>to Anderson the first fight that you can't take that away from him.</v>

1090
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Even in Spanish.</v>

1091
00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:22.783
<v Speaker 1>One was injured.</v>

1092
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 1>That was an incredible performance.</v>

1093
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.680
<v Speaker 1>He was minutes away from winning the title.</v>

1094
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.200
<v Speaker 1>He fucked up in that final round,</v>

1095
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.020
<v Speaker 1>but he was real close.</v>

1096
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Carries that with him though.</v>

1097
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that,</v>

1098
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1099
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.480
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say he doesn't,</v>

1100
00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.171
<v Speaker 1>it's harder to say.</v>

1101
00:30:35.171 --> 00:30:35.610
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't.</v>

1102
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.200
<v Speaker 1>Then to say does to say he does.</v>

1103
00:30:38.201 --> 00:30:40.000
<v Speaker 1>You can get all the evidence,</v>

1104
00:30:40.001 --> 00:30:42.210
<v Speaker 1>the Polo Filio fi this fight.</v>

1105
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.530
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

1106
00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1107
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:46.730
<v Speaker 1>the other thing is he's,</v>

1108
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:47.261
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1109
00:30:47.261 --> 00:30:51.250
<v Speaker 1>he's just playing at a real high level and this kind of shit happens.</v>

1110
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:56.460
<v Speaker 1>You read a real fucking high level and if you look at how it happens in every</v>

1111
00:30:57.191 --> 00:30:57.850
<v Speaker 1>other fight,</v>

1112
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:00.340
<v Speaker 1>it happened in a way that sort of makes sense to him.</v>

1113
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Like Anderson Silva caught him with the triangle that sort of makes sense to</v>

1114
00:31:03.221 --> 00:31:03.670
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

1115
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:04.720
<v Speaker 1>He missed that,</v>

1116
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.910
<v Speaker 1>that spinning back fist and he got caught.</v>

1117
00:31:06.911 --> 00:31:07.744
<v Speaker 1>That sort of makes sense.</v>

1118
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.970
<v Speaker 1>But the John John's fight didn't make any sense.</v>

1119
00:31:09.971 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>The Jon Jones fight was a mauling.</v>

1120
00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.600
<v Speaker 1>John just took them down in Malden.</v>

1121
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:17.020
<v Speaker 1>And I think that was like the most disappointing for him.</v>

1122
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1123
00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Cause he's a very good fighter man.</v>

1124
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:20.500
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the way he submitted Brian,</v>

1125
00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:21.334
<v Speaker 1>Stan,</v>

1126
00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:21.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1127
00:31:21.641 --> 00:31:22.131
<v Speaker 1>that's that,</v>

1128
00:31:22.131 --> 00:31:23.140
<v Speaker 1>that's a scary dude.</v>

1129
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.221
<v Speaker 1>Chill son.</v>

1130
00:31:24.221 --> 00:31:24.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a beast.</v>

1131
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:25.683
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1132
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.800
<v Speaker 1>But those guys are just to step better and that's what it is.</v>

1133
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.180
<v Speaker 1>It's just a step better.</v>

1134
00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 1>That's all they need to be.</v>

1135
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1136
00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:34.120
<v Speaker 1>so what's your opinion on,</v>

1137
00:31:34.121 --> 00:31:34.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1138
00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.140
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1139
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1140
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.420
<v Speaker 1>fights is accusing each other using steroids?</v>

1141
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1142
00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.180
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1143
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:40.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1144
00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:40.990
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1145
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:45.990
<v Speaker 1>we both know that in every sport in the world where there's money involved,</v>

1146
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:50.910
<v Speaker 1>people are going to do everything they can in order to be victorious.</v>

1147
00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.240
<v Speaker 1>That is just the way it is.</v>

1148
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:56.830
<v Speaker 1>There are people who hold principal higher than they hold money.</v>

1149
00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:01.840
<v Speaker 1>And I know for a fact I had a long conversation with John Fitch once about it</v>

1150
00:32:01.841 --> 00:32:02.710
<v Speaker 1>and John Fitch,</v>

1151
00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.260
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you that guy never used to anything ever.</v>

1152
00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.340
<v Speaker 1>He's just,</v>

1153
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 1>for him it was a principle issue.</v>

1154
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.880
<v Speaker 1>But that's not everybody.</v>

1155
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:10.310
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

1156
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.830

1157
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys have used stuff.</v>

1158
00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:14.710
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys have used stuff and they've said,</v>

1159
00:32:14.711 --> 00:32:14.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1167
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

1168
00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.780
<v Speaker 1>you realize when you're around a certain,</v>

1169
00:32:25.781 --> 00:32:29.950
<v Speaker 1>around a certain amount of like really strong wrestler type dudes,</v>

1170
00:32:29.951 --> 00:32:30.221
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>

1171
00:32:30.221 --> 00:32:31.054
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1172
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.860
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing I can do to keep this guy off me.</v>

1173
00:32:32.861 --> 00:32:34.750
<v Speaker 1>I've got to get fucking stronger period.</v>

1174
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.130
<v Speaker 1>If I want to stay in this game,</v>

1175
00:32:36.131 --> 00:32:37.090
<v Speaker 1>I got to get stronger.</v>

1176
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how the fuck he got that strong,</v>

1177
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:44.230
<v Speaker 1>but I got to get stronger and it's really hard to get stronger naturally quick.</v>

1178
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Naturally the shit takes a years.</v>

1179
00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:47.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1180
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:52.810
<v Speaker 1>it takes like four or five years to put on a good 20 pounds of like real raw</v>

1181
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:58.061
<v Speaker 1>muscle or we can do it this way and everybody's doing it and then you go,</v>

1182
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.010
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1183
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.000
<v Speaker 1>if everybody's doing it,</v>

1184
00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:03.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1185
00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:06.240
<v Speaker 1>people kind of kind of justify it to themselves because of the people that are</v>

1186
00:33:06.241 --> 00:33:06.521
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

1187
00:33:06.521 --> 00:33:06.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1188
00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.450
<v Speaker 1>it's like everybody enables each other.</v>

1189
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:09.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1190
00:33:09.591 --> 00:33:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

1191
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:10.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1192
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1193
00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1194
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.711
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1195
00:33:12.711 --> 00:33:17.020
<v Speaker 1>certainly an issue and there's certainly a discussion to be had and especially</v>

1196
00:33:17.021 --> 00:33:17.230
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

1197
00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:21.080
<v Speaker 1>in for testosterone replacement therapy,</v>

1198
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.070
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one.</v>

1199
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.320
<v Speaker 1>That to me is a big one because that one for a lot of folks that don't know,</v>

1200
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:32.180
<v Speaker 1>like young fighters in their early thirties even even some guys younger than</v>

1201
00:33:32.181 --> 00:33:32.810
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1202
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:33.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1203
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.640
<v Speaker 1>take testosterone,</v>

1204
00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.590
<v Speaker 1>which is really kind of crazy.</v>

1205
00:33:36.591 --> 00:33:36.921
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>

1206
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:41.070
<v Speaker 1>your body should be producing testosterone in healthy quality quantity.</v>

1207
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like deep,</v>

1208
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:43.130
<v Speaker 1>deep into your thirties.</v>

1209
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.590
<v Speaker 1>It starts to drop off when he started hitting 40,</v>

1210
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're like a very slowly,</v>

1211
00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.610
<v Speaker 1>very small numbers.</v>

1212
00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1213
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:50.631
<v Speaker 1>And if you're,</v>

1214
00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:52.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're fit and if you're,</v>

1215
00:33:52.251 --> 00:33:54.310
<v Speaker 1>you're eating healthy and if you know you're,</v>

1216
00:33:54.311 --> 00:33:55.400
<v Speaker 1>you sleeping right,</v>

1217
00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you should be okay.</v>

1218
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.420
<v Speaker 1>So when you find guys that are like 30,</v>

1219
00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:01.650
<v Speaker 1>and they're taking testosterone replacement therapy,</v>

1220
00:34:01.651 --> 00:34:02.030
<v Speaker 1>it will,</v>

1221
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:02.301
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1222
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:03.170
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

1223
00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:04.910
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing right now?</v>

1224
00:34:04.911 --> 00:34:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Is you're putting testosterone into your body that doesn't exist.</v>

1225
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.850
<v Speaker 1>So does it not exist because you've been hit too many times,</v>

1226
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:13.580
<v Speaker 1>which we both know was also a real possibility.</v>

1227
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.631
<v Speaker 1>In fact a,</v>

1228
00:34:14.631 --> 00:34:15.081
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

1229
00:34:15.081 --> 00:34:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Mark Gordon who worked with James Tony's,</v>

1230
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.020
<v Speaker 1>he's done a lot of work on that,</v>

1231
00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:26.680
<v Speaker 1>showing how traumatic brain injury to both soldiers and people who do extreme</v>

1232
00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:28.664
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>

1233
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.580
<v Speaker 1>that traumatic brain injury has a significant impact on your,</v>

1234
00:34:32.581 --> 00:34:34.450
<v Speaker 1>your body's ability to produce testosterone.</v>

1235
00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.660
<v Speaker 3>So I could knock the testosterone out of somebody's,</v>

1236
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:41.620
<v Speaker 3>well I don't like little girl [inaudible] is picking that line up.</v>

1237
00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:42.970
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

1238
00:34:42.970 --> 00:34:44.430
<v Speaker 3>it's not a situation where,</v>

1239
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:46.240
<v Speaker 1>where it happens in one,</v>

1240
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:47.110
<v Speaker 1>one night.</v>

1241
00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a situation where you're beating yourself up.</v>

1242
00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:50.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1243
00:34:50.861 --> 00:34:53.350
<v Speaker 1>if I've never fought in MMA fight,</v>

1244
00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:55.570
<v Speaker 1>but I've watched you guys trained and you know,</v>

1245
00:34:55.571 --> 00:34:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I see the,</v>

1246
00:34:56.831 --> 00:35:01.831
<v Speaker 1>the amount of hours that it takes in a day to do a real proper six week camp.</v>

1247
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:04.630
<v Speaker 1>And for folks who don't know,</v>

1248
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.800
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

1249
00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:07.131
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

1250
00:35:07.131 --> 00:35:07.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1251
00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.590
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking madness.</v>

1252
00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:12.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think some guys think the only way they can get through that is with some</v>

1253
00:35:12.281 --> 00:35:15.220
<v Speaker 1>help because if you don't get through that,</v>

1254
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:18.550
<v Speaker 1>then what are you going to do when you get in there with a guy like GSP,</v>

1255
00:35:18.551 --> 00:35:20.500
<v Speaker 1>when you know he has gone through that and like,</v>

1256
00:35:20.501 --> 00:35:21.820
<v Speaker 1>well fuck you know,</v>

1257
00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:22.151
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1258
00:35:22.151 --> 00:35:22.984
<v Speaker 1>you're doomed.</v>

1259
00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.670
<v Speaker 1>You're going to keep up with them for a little bit,</v>

1260
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.350
<v Speaker 1>but eventually he's going to steamroll you.</v>

1261
00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.323
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1262
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.660
<v Speaker 1>There's just no getting around it.</v>

1263
00:35:28.661 --> 00:35:30.460
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do what everybody else is doing,</v>

1264
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.870
<v Speaker 1>how can you compete?</v>

1265
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.551
<v Speaker 1>Unless I dry,</v>

1266
00:35:32.551 --> 00:35:33.640
<v Speaker 1>it dries like an alien.</v>

1267
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:35.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1268

1276
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:47.910

1277
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.780
<v Speaker 4>getting hired by Alienware spots with a lot of fighters.</v>

1278
00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.130
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1279
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:54.400

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 4>They can't have them wear that thing on their pants.</v>

1281

1298
00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1299
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.280
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

1300
00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.920
<v Speaker 4>I've been up to Montreal a couple of times to work with them and uh,</v>

1301
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.310
<v Speaker 4>well the first time I went up there I didn't know how they were going to receive</v>

1302
00:36:26.311 --> 00:36:27.360
<v Speaker 4>me know because obviously,</v>

1303
00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:28.230
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1304
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:33.230
<v Speaker 4>I did say a few things about this camp during the preparation and fake 10 line</v>

1305
00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:36.690
<v Speaker 4>was fucking outstanding.</v>

1306
00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>

1307
00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:38.363
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1308
00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:38.611
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1309
00:36:38.611 --> 00:36:39.300
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>

1310
00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.090
<v Speaker 4>they asked me to go out for a week to spar with him and I thought they were just</v>

1311
00:36:42.091 --> 00:36:42.690
<v Speaker 4>going to take me into,</v>

1312
00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.800
<v Speaker 4>to kind of beat me up a little bit,</v>

1313
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:44.873
<v Speaker 4>throw me out.</v>

1314
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.560
<v Speaker 4>But I was up for it anyway.</v>

1315
00:36:46.561 --> 00:36:49.320
<v Speaker 4>It was going to be an experience and when I got there everyone was really cool.</v>

1316
00:36:49.350 --> 00:36:49.741
<v Speaker 4>I felt,</v>

1317
00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:49.941
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1318
00:36:49.941 --> 00:36:50.774
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1319
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:51.913
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1320
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:52.201
<v Speaker 4>ready.</v>

1321
00:36:52.201 --> 00:36:52.470
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

1322
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:55.920
<v Speaker 4>And GSP is by far the most humble and deserve it champion.</v>

1323
00:36:55.921 --> 00:36:56.800
<v Speaker 4>Other than that,</v>

1324
00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:58.710
<v Speaker 4>there's no,</v>

1325
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.590
<v Speaker 4>no one liked him when it comes to like MMA champions.</v>

1326
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:02.460
<v Speaker 4>He's such a,</v>

1327
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:03.990
<v Speaker 4>he's a sweet guy.</v>

1328
00:37:03.991 --> 00:37:06.930
<v Speaker 4>Like real nice to Pete and he handles it really well,</v>

1329
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.161
<v Speaker 4>his lifestyle,</v>

1330
00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:09.090
<v Speaker 4>because obviously it's,</v>

1331
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:13.500
<v Speaker 4>he gets a lot of attention all the time and it's exhausting and he still,</v>

1332
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:14.750
<v Speaker 4>no matter how much attention he goes,</v>

1333
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:15.630
<v Speaker 4>he's still the same guy.</v>

1334
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:16.081
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

1335
00:37:16.081 --> 00:37:17.580
<v Speaker 4>he doesn't fall into it.</v>

1336
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.500
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1337
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.000
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1338
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.990
<v Speaker 4>that's a real issue with folks fall into that,</v>

1339
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1340
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.610
<v Speaker 4>they get caught up.</v>

1341
00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.790
<v Speaker 4>It was kind of funny going up there the first time because I still had a Mohawk</v>

1342
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:29.940
<v Speaker 4>the first time and like he goes out like most nights,</v>

1343
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:31.950
<v Speaker 4>he like loves to be out in clubs and stuff.</v>

1344
00:37:31.951 --> 00:37:33.660
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't drink and any of that.</v>

1345
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.890
<v Speaker 4>But obviously you can imagine how much attention he gets him Montreal.</v>

1346
00:37:37.891 --> 00:37:40.710
<v Speaker 4>And so he's walking through the club and everybody would like looks over him</v>

1347
00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.220
<v Speaker 4>staring at him and then they notice me behind him and they're like the look of</v>

1348
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.240
<v Speaker 4>confusion on their face.</v>

1349
00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Like we got hoodwinked motherfuckers like each other.</v>

1350
00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:53.791
<v Speaker 4>That's funny,</v>

1351
00:37:53.791 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1352
00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.193
<v Speaker 4>That's funny.</v>

1353
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:56.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1354
00:37:56.041 --> 00:37:59.100
<v Speaker 4>You know when all trickled down from the top that for Rasa hobby guy.</v>

1355
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1356
00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:00.331
<v Speaker 4>that's smart dude.</v>

1357
00:38:00.331 --> 00:38:00.990
<v Speaker 4>He is.</v>

1358
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.741
<v Speaker 4>It's a very,</v>

1359
00:38:01.741 --> 00:38:02.640
<v Speaker 4>very smart dude.</v>

1360
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.563
<v Speaker 4>Very clever.</v>

1361
00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:07.080
<v Speaker 4>The way he runs his show is no bullshit,</v>

1362
00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:07.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1363
00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:08.610
<v Speaker 4>and John Danaher's,</v>

1364
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:09.444
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1365
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.730
<v Speaker 4>people don't talk about this guy right in the hotel that I was staying at.</v>

1366
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:14.820
<v Speaker 4>My Room was opposite his.</v>

1367
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 4>So like he was the last person I'd see before,</v>

1368
00:38:16.981 --> 00:38:17.700
<v Speaker 4>like before,</v>

1369
00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.690
<v Speaker 4>like heading to bed at night.</v>

1370
00:38:18.691 --> 00:38:21.780
<v Speaker 4>And we stood in that long conversations in the corridor and the guy's</v>

1371
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:23.220
<v Speaker 4>fascinating and really,</v>

1372
00:38:23.221 --> 00:38:24.180
<v Speaker 4>really strange,</v>

1373
00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:24.541
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

1374
00:38:24.541 --> 00:38:25.410
<v Speaker 4>really strange and really,</v>

1375
00:38:25.411 --> 00:38:26.244
<v Speaker 4>really fascinating.</v>

1376
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:26.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1377
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.421
<v Speaker 4>I went to,</v>

1378
00:38:27.421 --> 00:38:28.380
<v Speaker 4>we went to dinner with him,</v>

1379
00:38:28.381 --> 00:38:28.621
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

1380
00:38:28.621 --> 00:38:29.640
<v Speaker 4>him in any bravo,</v>

1381
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1382
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 4>like a Denny's or some shit like that.</v>

1383
00:38:31.801 --> 00:38:34.050
<v Speaker 4>I then we just broke down the universe together.</v>

1384
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.250
<v Speaker 4>John Danaher is a beast.</v>

1385
00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:36.830
<v Speaker 1>He's amazing.</v>

1386
00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:37.241
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1387
00:38:37.241 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 1>so fucking smart.</v>

1388
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1389
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:39.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1390
00:38:39.221 --> 00:38:40.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually how I went.</v>

1391
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:43.990
<v Speaker 1>That's how I wound up doing the taekwondo with George.</v>

1392
00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1393
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And teaching them how to throw the attorney side kick correctly.</v>

1394
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.280
<v Speaker 1>It's from John Donahoe.</v>

1395
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:52.510
<v Speaker 1>Like Donna her was asking me if I knew any high level taekwondo guys,</v>

1396
00:38:52.511 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 1>they can teach George the proper mechanics of the spinning back kick.</v>

1397
00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And I felt like such an asshole saying like,</v>

1398
00:38:57.851 --> 00:38:58.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1399
00:38:58.151 --> 00:38:59.290
<v Speaker 1>I can judge it.</v>

1400
00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:00.323
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1401
00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:00.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1402
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:03.760
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like such a Hollywood douche move.</v>

1403
00:39:03.761 --> 00:39:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1404
00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:04.511
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1405
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to teach George fucking Saint Pierre how to throw a kick.</v>

1406
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.431
<v Speaker 1>But to his credit,</v>

1407
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 1>he actually listened to me like I couldn't believe he tried it.</v>

1408
00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:13.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1409
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.260
<v Speaker 1>because I wouldn't have listened to me.</v>

1410
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:15.041
<v Speaker 1>I be like,</v>

1411
00:39:15.041 --> 00:39:15.221
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1412
00:39:15.221 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 1>bitch.</v>

1413
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.473
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

1414
00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I'll go watch you kick a bag,</v>

1415
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.393
<v Speaker 1>fruitcake,</v>

1416
00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 1>what can act or Weirdo.</v>

1417
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 1>But George was like super like humble and eager to learn.</v>

1418
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:31.390
<v Speaker 1>He's a really unusual dude.</v>

1419
00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It's weird how many different,</v>

1420
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:38.630
<v Speaker 1>like the way people perceive like MMA fighters or even Jujitsu athletes are</v>

1421
00:39:40.391 --> 00:39:42.550
<v Speaker 1>kickboxers the way people perceive,</v>

1422
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:47.290
<v Speaker 1>like people who compete in combat sports and the way they really are.</v>

1423
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:48.310
<v Speaker 1>It's so different.</v>

1424
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Like my favorite people,</v>

1425
00:39:50.141 --> 00:39:53.770
<v Speaker 1>some of my favorite people of all time that I've ever met have been fighters</v>

1426
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:59.160
<v Speaker 1>because there's something about the type of character that you need to have to</v>

1427
00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:03.460
<v Speaker 1>be able to test yourself in such an extreme environment.</v>

1428
00:40:03.461 --> 00:40:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Like that's a rare quality.</v>

1429
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:06.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a very real quality.</v>

1430
00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:11.821
<v Speaker 1>And there's some people miss mistake it with being a barbaric thing cause they,</v>

1431
00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.920
<v Speaker 1>they think that somehow or another we should not be violent because violence is</v>

1432
00:40:17.921 --> 00:40:18.754
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

1433
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:23.440
<v Speaker 1>And even though it's a competition and they both agree to do it and they can be</v>

1434
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:23.981
<v Speaker 1>respectful,</v>

1435
00:40:23.981 --> 00:40:26.710
<v Speaker 1>it's still seems like it's anti societal.</v>

1436
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.593
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1437
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.530
<v Speaker 1>But they don't understand they did this.</v>

1438
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 1>They just haven't experienced anything like really intense themselves.</v>

1439
00:40:33.071 --> 00:40:33.261
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1440
00:40:33.261 --> 00:40:36.880
<v Speaker 1>and knowing that there's only one way to develop like real character and have</v>

1441
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:38.080
<v Speaker 1>confidence in that real character,</v>

1442
00:40:38.081 --> 00:40:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you've got to put yourself in fire.</v>

1443
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1444
00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.120
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

1445
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:40.761
<v Speaker 6>and that's why it,</v>

1446
00:40:40.761 --> 00:40:42.320
<v Speaker 6>that's why a lot of them may fight as a,</v>

1447
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.680
<v Speaker 6>of our interest in people.</v>

1448
00:40:43.681 --> 00:40:44.490
<v Speaker 6>But yes,</v>

1449
00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:44.761
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1450
00:40:44.761 --> 00:40:45.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1451
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.600
<v Speaker 6>after a certain amount of time of being in the gym and being so focused on</v>

1452
00:40:48.601 --> 00:40:49.140
<v Speaker 6>yourself,</v>

1453
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:51.310
<v Speaker 6>you become very self aware and,</v>

1454
00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.170
<v Speaker 6>and then,</v>

1455
00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:52.480
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1456
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:54.820
<v Speaker 6>usually from that becomes a lot of self confidence and,</v>

1457
00:40:54.821 --> 00:40:55.081
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

1458
00:40:55.081 --> 00:40:55.650
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1459
00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.060
<v Speaker 6>just being very comfortable in,</v>

1460
00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:58.350
<v Speaker 6>in different environments,</v>

1461
00:40:58.351 --> 00:41:00.250
<v Speaker 6>which usually means you stand out because you,</v>

1462
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:00.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1463
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:01.260
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

1464
00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.480
<v Speaker 6>you kind of put that out there when you,</v>

1465
00:41:02.481 --> 00:41:03.480
<v Speaker 6>when you walk into a room.</v>

1466
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.850
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

1467
00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:07.190
<v Speaker 1>and you're not worried about physical confrontation,</v>

1468
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.560
<v Speaker 1>but you will sit and feel like you have anything to prove.</v>

1469
00:41:09.561 --> 00:41:10.394
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1470
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:14.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's the real issue with a lot of guys is the need to prove dominance and</v>

1471
00:41:14.311 --> 00:41:15.200
<v Speaker 1>need to prove.</v>

1472
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.320
<v Speaker 1>But guys who have had martial arts backgrounds,</v>

1473
00:41:18.321 --> 00:41:19.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't have that need.</v>

1474
00:41:19.431 --> 00:41:20.450
<v Speaker 1>They can chill.</v>

1475
00:41:20.451 --> 00:41:21.740
<v Speaker 1>They can relax their way.</v>

1476
00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Easier to be around.</v>

1477
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1478
00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Like I've never seen shit start up between like maybe Brazilian dudes have.</v>

1479
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some Brazilian dudes have jumped each other.</v>

1480
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I was watching a video and Vandelay Silva was in,</v>

1481
00:41:32.601 --> 00:41:34.590
<v Speaker 1>it was two fighting in the dressing room in La.</v>

1482
00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:37.730
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] silver and Charles Crazy Horse Bryant.</v>

1483
00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1484
00:41:38.301 --> 00:41:38.571
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1485
00:41:38.571 --> 00:41:38.751
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1486
00:41:38.751 --> 00:41:38.991
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1487
00:41:38.991 --> 00:41:40.360
<v Speaker 1>it was two of the guys in like Vander,</v>

1488
00:41:40.361 --> 00:41:41.420
<v Speaker 1>they was culinary and one of them.</v>

1489
00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.171
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1490
00:41:42.171 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 1>that was Cristiana Marcello and in a triangle.</v>

1491
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:44.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1492
00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:46.250
<v Speaker 1>he got them a try and I'll put them to sleep.</v>

1493
00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.181
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

1494
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:48.470
<v Speaker 1>but it was Charles Crazy horse.</v>

1495
00:41:48.471 --> 00:41:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Brian and crazy horse actually got up.</v>

1496
00:41:51.051 --> 00:41:54.740
<v Speaker 1>The legend is and sucker punched Vandelay and knocked him out cold.</v>

1497
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:59.300
<v Speaker 1>And it was right before Vandelay was supposed to fight Ricardo Arona and</v>

1498
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Vandelay literally got knocked out,</v>

1499
00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:06.260
<v Speaker 1>got woke up and that sent out to this is if you're going to believe Charles</v>

1500
00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Crazy Yours Brian,</v>

1501
00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 1>which I wonder if he's telling the truth man,</v>

1502
00:42:09.171 --> 00:42:13.910
<v Speaker 1>cause you crazy horse was nuts and he could knock a motherfucker out.</v>

1503
00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:16.220
<v Speaker 1>He had a serious punch.</v>

1504
00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Crazy horse could punch fucking hard enough to easily knock on 185 pounds if he</v>

1505
00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:23.241
<v Speaker 1>sucker punched him.</v>

1506
00:42:23.241 --> 00:42:26.120
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that fight where he told that stuffed bear apart in the</v>

1507
00:42:26.121 --> 00:42:26.954
<v Speaker 1>columns?</v>

1508
00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Well he would get to the top of the cage and do back flips off the top of the</v>

1509
00:42:33.321 --> 00:42:33.621
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>

1510
00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:34.850
<v Speaker 1>He was like the first dude doing that.</v>

1511
00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:35.871
<v Speaker 1>Sit on the top.</v>

1512
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Sit on the uh,</v>

1513
00:42:36.730 --> 00:42:37.650
<v Speaker 1>the colon or post.</v>

1514
00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1515
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.160
<v Speaker 1>just jump up and sit up there during the fight.</v>

1516
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.600
<v Speaker 1>He would sucker punch guys like in the middle of around just wham and that in</v>

1517
00:42:45.601 --> 00:42:46.570
<v Speaker 1>and just knock them out.</v>

1518
00:42:46.571 --> 00:42:46.660
<v Speaker 1>Call.</v>

1519
00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:50.470
<v Speaker 1>It would be like a punch that you don't think should land had filled a goatee.</v>

1520
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:51.383
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1521
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:52.970
<v Speaker 1>Balaclava what he's doing.</v>

1522
00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:54.430
<v Speaker 1>These interviews deprive him of that.</v>

1523
00:42:54.490 --> 00:42:55.600
<v Speaker 1>But when he was fighting machine mine,</v>

1524
00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:58.450
<v Speaker 1>he was calling him mishy mash up like this,</v>

1525
00:42:58.520 --> 00:42:59.230
<v Speaker 1>these eyes.</v>

1526
00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:02.990
<v Speaker 1>So it was the fighter that while the,</v>

1527
00:43:02.991 --> 00:43:03.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1528
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:04.970
<v Speaker 1>the referees reading the instructions,</v>

1529
00:43:04.971 --> 00:43:07.730
<v Speaker 1>he's like mugging to the camera with his big giant smell,</v>

1530
00:43:07.731 --> 00:43:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the gold teeth.</v>

1531
00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:09.590
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

1532
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:11.600
<v Speaker 1>he was another character right out of a fucking movie.</v>

1533
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:11.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1534
00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1535
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:14.090
<v Speaker 1>He was constantly getting arrested constantly.</v>

1536
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with that dude.</v>

1537
00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:19.490
<v Speaker 1>Me and him and Eddie Bravo hung out with him and his girlfriend.</v>

1538
00:43:19.491 --> 00:43:20.810
<v Speaker 1>We watched some fights together.</v>

1539
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:21.441
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1546
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:33.860
<v Speaker 1>And just by chance we sat right next to each other.</v>

1548
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 1>That dude was hilarious.</v>

1549

1552
00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.190
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda cool sometimes when you get get exposed to one of those people just</v>

1553
00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:46.881
<v Speaker 1>for a few hours.</v>

1554
00:43:46.881 --> 00:43:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1555
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:47.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1556
00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:52.360
<v Speaker 1>I had a college like from Hollywood to Temecula and back with mayhem and it was</v>

1557
00:43:52.581 --> 00:43:54.530
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most high speed,</v>

1558
00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:55.640
<v Speaker 1>scariest rides.</v>

1559
00:43:55.641 --> 00:43:56.474
<v Speaker 1>It haven't been on,</v>

1560
00:43:56.620 --> 00:43:56.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1561
00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:00.230
<v Speaker 1>he's like sitting in the driver's seat with a shirt with like guns all over it</v>

1562
00:44:00.231 --> 00:44:03.740
<v Speaker 1>and a big chain with a gun on their sunglasses on and he's just like speeding.</v>

1563
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.270
<v Speaker 1>And every now and then he said he's like,</v>

1564
00:44:05.271 --> 00:44:06.350
<v Speaker 1>police track thing will beep.</v>

1565
00:44:06.351 --> 00:44:07.460
<v Speaker 1>And they were like hitting the brakes,</v>

1566
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.640
<v Speaker 1>swerving in and out and talking to a hundred miles an hour.</v>

1567
00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's like two hours from there and it's five,</v>

1568
00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.860
<v Speaker 1>four hours of that as well as the training session in the middle.</v>

1569
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I was exhausted by the time I got really lucky to be alive.</v>

1570
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I needed like three days.</v>

1571
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I hung out with clay.</v>

1572
00:44:22.311 --> 00:44:22.641
<v Speaker 1>Guido,</v>

1573
00:44:22.641 --> 00:44:23.960
<v Speaker 1>what weekend in Chicago.</v>

1574
00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.910
<v Speaker 1>Then he took me to my show.</v>

1575
00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.040
<v Speaker 1>He insisted on taking me to my show.</v>

1576
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.671
<v Speaker 1>So it was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>me and him and Eddie Bravo and a clay.</v>

1579
00:44:31.261 --> 00:44:32.094
<v Speaker 1>Guido was dry.</v>

1580
00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:34.600
<v Speaker 1>He Clay Guinta drives like light.</v>

1581
00:44:34.601 --> 00:44:35.434
<v Speaker 1>He fights.</v>

1582
00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.320
<v Speaker 1>He drives exactly like he fights,</v>

1583
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but just sitting there just going,</v>

1584
00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:39.833
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1585
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I trust him.</v>

1586
00:44:42.181 --> 00:44:43.410
<v Speaker 1>I think he knows what he's doing.</v>

1587
00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.631
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1588
00:44:43.631 --> 00:44:44.381
<v Speaker 3>Sam Aaa.</v>

1589
00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:46.630
<v Speaker 3>I just got back from driving with him.</v>

1590
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:50.410
<v Speaker 3>You let Sam dry is the scariest man.</v>

1591
00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:55.030
<v Speaker 3>He's just like sideswiping swiping cars while texting and talking on the phone.</v>

1592
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:56.680
<v Speaker 3>I let them text and drive.</v>

1593
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:57.431
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

1594
00:44:57.431 --> 00:44:58.570
<v Speaker 3>he was just out of control.</v>

1595
00:44:58.571 --> 00:44:59.530
<v Speaker 3>It's so funny,</v>

1596
00:44:59.531 --> 00:44:59.681
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1597
00:44:59.681 --> 00:45:01.420
<v Speaker 3>I was scared out of my mind.</v>

1598
00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:05.700
<v Speaker 3>That's bad man and now and I gave him my car to drive up to San Francisco.</v>

1599
00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:06.700
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1600
00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:09.490
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know how bad it was and then when I was up there I was like,</v>

1601
00:45:09.491 --> 00:45:09.911
<v Speaker 3>oh shit,</v>

1602
00:45:09.911 --> 00:45:10.750
<v Speaker 3>he has to drive home.</v>

1603
00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:11.231
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1604
00:45:11.231 --> 00:45:12.130
<v Speaker 3>oh please Tony,</v>

1605
00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:13.780
<v Speaker 3>just please drive most of the time.</v>

1606
00:45:13.781 --> 00:45:16.600
<v Speaker 3>And so they drove your car up.</v>

1607
00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:17.933
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

1608
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.181
<v Speaker 3>God damn,</v>

1609
00:45:19.181 --> 00:45:20.200
<v Speaker 3>that's a long ride.</v>

1610
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.730
<v Speaker 3>How much is a southwest flight?</v>

1611
00:45:21.731 --> 00:45:22.600
<v Speaker 3>Took a hundred bucks.</v>

1612
00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:23.471
<v Speaker 3>Cheap.</v>

1613
00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:24.160
<v Speaker 3>Fuck hot.</v>

1614
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:24.371
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1615
00:45:24.371 --> 00:45:25.390
<v Speaker 3>it was like I had this,</v>

1616
00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.700
<v Speaker 3>I spent like $500 round trip for,</v>

1617
00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.290
<v Speaker 3>for going up there for some reason.</v>

1618
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it was because of that Cinco de Mayo or whatever.</v>

1619
00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:33.371
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

1620
00:45:33.371 --> 00:45:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1621
00:45:33.890 --> 00:45:35.230
<v Speaker 3>They Jack up rates.</v>

1622
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.760
<v Speaker 3>Southwest doesn't go direct to a San Francisco.</v>

1623
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.080
<v Speaker 3>They don't know.</v>

1624
00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:41.890
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that weird?</v>

1625
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:42.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1626
00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.600
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy Nigga.</v>

1627
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.920
<v Speaker 3>I know they go to San Jose.</v>

1628
00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1629
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.260
<v Speaker 3>that's not far from San Francisco.</v>

1630
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.230
<v Speaker 3>You could do San Jose and then he'd drive for like 30 minutes.</v>

1631
00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.520
<v Speaker 3>What was going to do Oakland,</v>

1632
00:45:51.521 --> 00:45:54.640
<v Speaker 3>but you have to take that stupid thing underneath the ocean.</v>

1633
00:45:54.641 --> 00:45:55.040
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1634
00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:55.471
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

1635
00:45:55.471 --> 00:45:57.070
<v Speaker 3>You've already scared me enough to,</v>

1636
00:45:57.071 --> 00:45:58.750
<v Speaker 3>it never did at the bar.</v>

1637
00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:01.420
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever done the Bart in San Francisco?</v>

1638
00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:06.580
<v Speaker 3>We were filming fear factor in Oakland and I ate a pot cookie or something and</v>

1639
00:46:06.581 --> 00:46:09.400
<v Speaker 3>my hotel room because I was hanging out with the crew and they were really cool</v>

1640
00:46:09.401 --> 00:46:09.970
<v Speaker 3>guys.</v>

1641
00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:11.230
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

1642
00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:12.430
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

1643
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:13.030
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1644
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:16.180
<v Speaker 3>I have this cookie and let me just say would probably make it more interesting</v>

1645
00:46:16.181 --> 00:46:17.014
<v Speaker 3>hanging out with these.</v>

1646
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.250
<v Speaker 1>So I take this,</v>

1647
00:46:19.251 --> 00:46:19.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1648
00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:20.331
<v Speaker 1>it's not an insult.</v>

1649
00:46:20.331 --> 00:46:21.050
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

1650
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.920
<v Speaker 1>but they were straight.</v>

1651
00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:22.763
<v Speaker 1>It's my point.</v>

1652
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.541
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't say,</v>

1653
00:46:23.541 --> 00:46:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1654
00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:24.920
<v Speaker 1>who wants some pot cookies?</v>

1655
00:46:24.921 --> 00:46:25.191
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>

1656
00:46:25.191 --> 00:46:25.391
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1657
00:46:25.391 --> 00:46:26.224
<v Speaker 1>hold on me.</v>

1658
00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:27.141
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

1659
00:46:27.141 --> 00:46:27.291
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1660
00:46:27.291 --> 00:46:27.530
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1661
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:28.460
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna get me that.</v>

1662
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:28.881
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

1663
00:46:28.881 --> 00:46:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Are you crazy?</v>

1664
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.381
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1665
00:46:30.381 --> 00:46:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Powell.</v>

1666
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.841
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1667
00:46:30.841 --> 00:46:31.551
<v Speaker 1>you meant straight late.</v>

1668
00:46:31.551 --> 00:46:32.384
<v Speaker 1>They don't drink drugs.</v>

1669
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:33.560
<v Speaker 1>They don't fuck around.</v>

1670
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Were strict.</v>

1671
00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:35.151
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1672
00:46:35.151 --> 00:46:35.421
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1673
00:46:35.421 --> 00:46:35.721
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1674
00:46:35.721 --> 00:46:37.310
<v Speaker 1>well it couldn't have good success with them.</v>

1675
00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:39.320
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1676
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.530
<v Speaker 1>they were straight straight arrows.</v>

1677
00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Like you could offer them a drink.</v>

1678
00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a margarita.</v>

1679
00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I know they get crazy.</v>

1680
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:47.240
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a Margarita,</v>

1681
00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:48.470
<v Speaker 1>but if you like,</v>

1682
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.260
<v Speaker 1>who wants to eat some hash fucking get the fuck away from me.</v>

1683
00:46:53.090 --> 00:46:55.520
<v Speaker 1>So eight this pot cooking and I get on this bar thing,</v>

1684
00:46:55.521 --> 00:46:55.820
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1685
00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:56.690
<v Speaker 1>I am flying.</v>

1686
00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.490
<v Speaker 1>I just totally over modulated.</v>

1687
00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you just,</v>

1688
00:47:00.111 --> 00:47:01.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the fuck you're eating.</v>

1689
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Just eat one and it just puts you,</v>

1690
00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.630
<v Speaker 1>it puts you in almost like in another dimension.</v>

1691
00:47:05.631 --> 00:47:08.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like you like your face is under a waterfall,</v>

1692
00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:10.300
<v Speaker 1>like about to peer to the other side.</v>

1693
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Just can't quite get there like that high and my ears are ringing.</v>

1694
00:47:13.791 --> 00:47:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm like more pop and I'm like,</v>

1695
00:47:15.501 --> 00:47:16.660
<v Speaker 1>why am I even popping?</v>

1696
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:17.301
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

1697
00:47:17.301 --> 00:47:19.010
<v Speaker 1>because we're 500 feet under water.</v>

1698
00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1699
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.670
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck he talking about?</v>

1700
00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Never said yes to this.</v>

1701
00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:30.020
<v Speaker 1>If you asked me do you want to go in a fucking that's under the</v>

1702
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.300
<v Speaker 4>ocean in a place where the ground moves,</v>

1703
00:47:32.301 --> 00:47:32.691
<v Speaker 4>I would have said,</v>

1704
00:47:32.691 --> 00:47:33.501
<v Speaker 4>fuck you.</v>

1705
00:47:33.501 --> 00:47:34.670
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to do that.</v>

1706
00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:36.110
<v Speaker 4>Why are we doing that?</v>

1707
00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.210
<v Speaker 4>That's like playing musical chairs.</v>

1708
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:38.900
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1709
00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.540
<v Speaker 4>I can catch a train from my apartment in Nottingham.</v>

1710
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:42.650
<v Speaker 4>I found this out through the day.</v>

1711
00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:46.010
<v Speaker 4>I've been telling everybody and catch a train from my apartment in Nottingham to</v>

1712
00:47:46.011 --> 00:47:46.844
<v Speaker 4>Saigon.</v>

1713
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.600
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1714
00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.180
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1715
00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.280
<v Speaker 4>How is that possible?</v>

1716
00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:50.143
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1717
00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:53.540
<v Speaker 4>The problem is the only part of the journey I would struggle with is the channel</v>

1718
00:47:53.541 --> 00:47:53.940
<v Speaker 4>tunnel.</v>

1719
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:54.773
<v Speaker 4>It's</v>

1720
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:59.920
<v Speaker 4>like apparently apparently one train has to stop while the other one goes past</v>

1721
00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.310
<v Speaker 4>because the pressure would just</v>

1722
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:05.380
<v Speaker 4>go under the ocean under the ocean.</v>

1723
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.700
<v Speaker 4>The fuck with that shit.</v>

1724
00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.710
<v Speaker 4>That is a movie waiting to happen.</v>

1725
00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.650
<v Speaker 4>They will tell your story for many,</v>

1726
00:48:12.651 --> 00:48:13.880
<v Speaker 4>many years in the future.</v>

1727
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:16.280
<v Speaker 4>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

1728
00:48:16.281 --> 00:48:18.980
<v Speaker 4>It was like a titanic kind of movie into fuck that movie.</v>

1729
00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:19.940
<v Speaker 4>That movie sucks.</v>

1730
00:48:19.941 --> 00:48:21.470
<v Speaker 4>You do not want to be in that movie.</v>

1731
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.810
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to be dude in tunnels of concrete under seawater.</v>

1732
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:28.340
<v Speaker 4>Just seeing the rocks tumbling towards you.</v>

1733
00:48:28.341 --> 00:48:32.270
<v Speaker 4>Enormous rocks with walls of water behind them,</v>

1734
00:48:32.271 --> 00:48:35.030
<v Speaker 4>pushing them rocks at her thousands of pounds.</v>

1735
00:48:35.031 --> 00:48:39.630
<v Speaker 4>And it's a matter of 10 15 seconds for the hit in that circumstance as well.</v>

1736
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.790
<v Speaker 4>You're so insignificant.</v>

1737
00:48:40.850 --> 00:48:41.930
<v Speaker 4>You don't matter bitch.</v>

1738
00:48:41.931 --> 00:48:44.240
<v Speaker 4>You are a footnote in history and that's a wrap.</v>

1739
00:48:44.241 --> 00:48:45.980
<v Speaker 4>Son cleaned her up.</v>

1740
00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:46.671
<v Speaker 4>You're clear.</v>

1741
00:48:46.671 --> 00:48:47.504
<v Speaker 4>Mr. Hardy.</v>

1742
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.720
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for playing this life and that's why I didn't go to that airport.</v>

1743
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:52.783
<v Speaker 4>Good move.</v>

1744
00:48:53.570 --> 00:48:53.991
<v Speaker 4>Good move.</v>

1745
00:48:53.991 --> 00:48:55.010
<v Speaker 4>Now that you put it that way,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the beads.</v>

1784
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.000
<v Speaker 4>This is like a certain thing too.</v>

1785
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:41.361
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1786
00:49:41.361 --> 00:49:43.330
<v Speaker 4>it sucks when someone's faking that.</v>

1787
00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:44.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1788
00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:44.730
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.860
<v Speaker 4>just bend some white sage and the better,</v>

1792
00:49:47.861 --> 00:49:48.221
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

1793
00:49:48.221 --> 00:49:48.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1794
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:49.060
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1795
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.810
<v Speaker 4>you can see those people from a mile away.</v>

1796
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

1797
00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.790
<v Speaker 4>It got great praise on older women.</v>

1798
00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:55.953
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1799
00:49:56.350 --> 00:50:00.970
<v Speaker 4>He's got this older woman and she's quite a bit older than him and less</v>

1800
00:50:00.971 --> 00:50:01.810
<v Speaker 4>attractive to him,</v>

1801
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:06.670
<v Speaker 4>but he's young and fairly useless and like this fake guru type character.</v>

1802
00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:07.811
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1803
00:50:07.811 --> 00:50:08.591
<v Speaker 4>there's a documentary,</v>

1804
00:50:08.591 --> 00:50:09.311
<v Speaker 4>I can't what it's called.</v>

1805
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:12.210
<v Speaker 4>It's on Netflix and it's a guy who he goes out to.</v>

1806
00:50:12.211 --> 00:50:13.044
<v Speaker 4>Have you seen it?</v>

1807
00:50:13.090 --> 00:50:13.621
<v Speaker 4>Goes out to it?</v>

1808
00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:13.991
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

1809
00:50:13.991 --> 00:50:14.801
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen it,</v>

1810
00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:15.011
<v Speaker 4>but I've,</v>

1811
00:50:15.011 --> 00:50:16.120
<v Speaker 4>I've heard about to watch it.</v>

1812
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:19.460
<v Speaker 4>He makes a fake religion fake gurry yeah.</v>

1813
00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:19.660
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1814
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.010
<v Speaker 4>If it becomes a fake girl,</v>

1815
00:50:21.250 --> 00:50:21.700
<v Speaker 4>let's see,</v>

1816
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:22.810
<v Speaker 4>document around fake group.</v>

1817
00:50:23.130 --> 00:50:23.963
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1818
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:28.460
<v Speaker 4>Netflix just poured that plug in like 2000 live movies.</v>

1819
00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:29.121
<v Speaker 1>They just did.</v>

1820
00:50:29.121 --> 00:50:29.940
<v Speaker 1>They really,</v>

1821
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.430
<v Speaker 1>cause they lost contracts with,</v>

1822
00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a Warner brothers or something.</v>

1823
00:50:33.441 --> 00:50:35.180
<v Speaker 1>But like South Park's gone,</v>

1824
00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:37.550
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of shit was gone from it.</v>

1825
00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:42.551
<v Speaker 1>Right now Kumar is a true film about a false prophet with a watch is kind of</v>

1826
00:50:45.291 --> 00:50:46.124
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

1827
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:48.651
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked.</v>

1828
00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 1>How easy it is to trick people.</v>

1829
00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:51.320
<v Speaker 1>That's unfortunate.</v>

1830
00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:52.563
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1831
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.690
<v Speaker 1>people want,</v>

1832
00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:58.810
<v Speaker 1>you know why I think this is why I think it's because it's an insanely rare</v>

1833
00:51:00.051 --> 00:51:05.051
<v Speaker 1>quality to be truly enlightened or even truly on the path of enlightened,</v>

1834
00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:11.510
<v Speaker 1>which a true path of enlightenment with true focus and you know,</v>

1835
00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:15.560
<v Speaker 1>and and on a path for a real,</v>

1836
00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:19.500
<v Speaker 1>the pure sake of trying to figure out what this life is,</v>

1837
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:21.200
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to live this life better.</v>

1838
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:22.790
<v Speaker 1>There's so few people really,</v>

1839
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:23.740
<v Speaker 1>really doing that.</v>

1840
00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:27.020
<v Speaker 1>That to even like attempt to do it is so douchey.</v>

1841
00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Ish.</v>

1842
00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It's intimidating to think for yourself though.</v>

1843
00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's where a lot of people fall.</v>

1844
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:31.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1845
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.651
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1846
00:51:31.651 --> 00:51:32.750
<v Speaker 1>it's scary to think for yourself.</v>

1847
00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So they want somebody else to do it for them.</v>

1848
00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.001
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

1849
00:51:35.001 --> 00:51:35.721
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

1850
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:40.721
<v Speaker 1>we don't like people proclaiming that there is something more grand than the</v>

1851
00:51:41.691 --> 00:51:42.361
<v Speaker 1>rest of us.</v>

1852
00:51:42.361 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1853
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Some people we don't like people proclaiming that they're on the path to</v>

1854
00:51:46.791 --> 00:51:50.180
<v Speaker 1>figuring out where you're screaming in your car at a red light and you can't</v>

1855
00:51:50.181 --> 00:51:52.340
<v Speaker 1>balance a checkbook and you know,</v>

1856
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:53.203
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

1857
00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:58.100
<v Speaker 1>People don't want to believe that there's a guy who really does do yoga every</v>

1858
00:51:58.101 --> 00:52:02.450
<v Speaker 1>day and really does like find his center and it's made him a more joyous person.</v>

1859
00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Sad that that is what I hear from you.</v>

1860
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:07.250
<v Speaker 1>A lot of you talking about you buddy.</v>

1861
00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:11.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what I hear a lot of you being impressed with yourself.</v>

1862
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:15.500
<v Speaker 1>A lot of your fucking annoying with your flip flops and that that's what</v>

1863
00:52:15.501 --> 00:52:15.981
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

1864
00:52:15.981 --> 00:52:18.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's so many of those guys,</v>

1865
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:19.423
<v Speaker 1>there's so many,</v>

1866
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1867
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:23.930
<v Speaker 1>I had this doctor a mic go swami in here once a theoretical physicist guy,</v>

1868
00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:29.050
<v Speaker 1>genius guy and he was saying that sometimes people have to fake things in order</v>

1869
00:52:29.361 --> 00:52:31.550
<v Speaker 1>to really truly make them happen.</v>

1870
00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:32.260
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1871
00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.350
<v Speaker 1>like I let people,</v>

1872
00:52:33.351 --> 00:52:33.771
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

1873
00:52:33.771 --> 00:52:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I let people use the word quantum when I know they don't really know what it</v>

1874
00:52:36.681 --> 00:52:37.514
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

1875
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.950
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

1876
00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:44.120
<v Speaker 1>but if this guy like has interest in like faking it,</v>

1877
00:52:44.121 --> 00:52:48.110
<v Speaker 1>like maybe it would lead to a real interest in trying to understand quantum</v>

1878
00:52:48.111 --> 00:52:48.944
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

1879
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:49.641
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1880
00:52:49.641 --> 00:52:50.451
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1881
00:52:50.451 --> 00:52:53.690
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking interesting way to look at it and say like,</v>

1882
00:52:53.691 --> 00:52:54.590
<v Speaker 1>so I go,</v>

1883
00:52:54.591 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 1>so like false gurus and play go say just to let them fake it.</v>

1884
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:01.100
<v Speaker 1>Which I guess,</v>

1885
00:53:01.101 --> 00:53:01.640
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1886
00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:02.473
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1887
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:03.950
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1888
00:53:03.951 --> 00:53:04.784
<v Speaker 1>then they start,</v>

1889
00:53:04.830 --> 00:53:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1890
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking everybody's wives and well yeah,</v>

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:08.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1892
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Kill all the male babies.</v>

1893
00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:11.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1894
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:13.970
<v Speaker 1>it always go south always.</v>

1895
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's always a maligned and shit.</v>

1896
00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:18.230
<v Speaker 1>His had been a woman run ever.</v>

1897
00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:20.690
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell me that there's a fucking,</v>

1898
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:26.230
<v Speaker 1>just that alone is great evidence that women are way less dangerous than men.</v>

1899
00:53:28.590 --> 00:53:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1900
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 1>they did.</v>

1901
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:32.430
<v Speaker 1>They have less of a desire to control the environment.</v>

1902
00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:32.911
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1903
00:53:32.911 --> 00:53:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have a shitty woman boss Shane,</v>

1904
00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:36.264
<v Speaker 1>no cult leader,</v>

1905
00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:39.960
<v Speaker 1>not the closest woman called leader.</v>

1906
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.710
<v Speaker 1>She's the closest to a woman caught later cause she kind of is.</v>

1907
00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:44.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1908
00:53:44.191 --> 00:53:45.390
<v Speaker 1>She's kind of running a call.</v>

1909
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:51.500
<v Speaker 1>She's running a cult of happiness amongst women over 35 Chardonnay called spark.</v>

1910
00:53:52.810 --> 00:53:53.643
<v Speaker 1>Make all,</v>

1911
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.870
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1912
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:55.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1913
00:53:55.231 --> 00:53:56.040
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>

1914
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:56.521
<v Speaker 1>that's her.</v>

1915
00:53:56.521 --> 00:53:57.241
<v Speaker 1>Her Shit.</v>

1916
00:53:57.241 --> 00:53:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I guess she could run a cult,</v>

1917
00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1918
00:53:59.401 --> 00:54:03.750
<v Speaker 1>but like there's not a lot of women who could pull that off and run a call and</v>

1919
00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.460
<v Speaker 1>what the world looks like from her perspective,</v>

1920
00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:06.870
<v Speaker 1>from Oprah's perspective,</v>

1921
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:09.570
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be insanity is first of all,</v>

1922
00:54:09.571 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 1>how many women have ever achieved that before?</v>

1923
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.931
<v Speaker 1>How many,</v>

1924
00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:14.400
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you're a man.</v>

1925
00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:16.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're a man and you're like a media mogul,</v>

1926
00:54:16.681 --> 00:54:17.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1927
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 1>oh look another one,</v>

1928

<v Speaker 1>It makes a lot of money.</v>

1937

<v Speaker 1>how many girls have just had all these women screaming and cheering whether they</v>

1941
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:36.630
<v Speaker 1>see her,</v>

1942
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:38.670
<v Speaker 1>she gives away cars and shit.</v>

1943
00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Saves people in Africa.</v>

1944
00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.573
<v Speaker 1>How many girls?</v>

1945
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:41.830
<v Speaker 1>What does,</v>

1946
00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:43.620
<v Speaker 1>is there one other one ever?</v>

1947
00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:48.270
<v Speaker 1>The Angelina Jo leads kind of like rocking it in some sort of weird way,</v>

1948
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but she doesn't have like a talk show,</v>

1949
00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:51.940
<v Speaker 1>but she's talking every day.</v>

1950
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:52.783
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

1951
00:54:52.830 --> 00:54:53.910
<v Speaker 1>can't control.</v>

1952
00:54:53.911 --> 00:54:56.690
<v Speaker 1>That's like you can give people instructions and they'll follow it.</v>

1953
00:54:56.700 --> 00:54:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Go and buy this and millions of women will go out and buy it.</v>

1954
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:01.350
<v Speaker 1>That's scary power.</v>

1955
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1956
00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:02.820
<v Speaker 1>Oprah powers.</v>

1957
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Weird power.</v>

1958
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:03.830
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1959
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:05.960
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that a human achieves that bit,</v>

1960
00:55:05.961 --> 00:55:06.600
<v Speaker 1>but she can't,</v>

1961
00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:10.440
<v Speaker 1>she has to sacrifice like real relationships with people we like.</v>

1962
00:55:10.441 --> 00:55:12.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't have a real connection with anybody or you can't develop new</v>

1963
00:55:12.811 --> 00:55:15.360
<v Speaker 1>connections when you get to that kind of status.</v>

1964
00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:16.413
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1965
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you don't let anybody in.</v>

1966
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:19.081
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1967
00:55:19.081 --> 00:55:19.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1968
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:21.870
<v Speaker 1>the only reason you wouldn't is if you think that you're better than other</v>

1969
00:55:21.871 --> 00:55:23.430
<v Speaker 1>people because you're successful.</v>

1970
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.730
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1971
00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:25.180
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1972
00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:28.590
<v Speaker 1>the issue of running into people that have wanted to take advantage of you,</v>

1973
00:55:28.650 --> 00:55:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have that no matter what you know,</v>

1974
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.110
<v Speaker 1>you would hope that your filter is good enough that you'd be able to,</v>

1975
00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:35.280
<v Speaker 1>but when it gets to this stage,</v>

1976
00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:38.420
<v Speaker 1>you can't go anywhere without someone recognizing your,</v>

1977
00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:40.260
<v Speaker 1>like everybody knows who you are.</v>

1978
00:55:40.290 --> 00:55:40.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1979
00:55:40.411 --> 00:55:41.370
<v Speaker 1>You fucked up son.</v>

1980
00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:42.630
<v Speaker 1>You took it too deep.</v>

1981
00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Should've backed off Elvis to stay alive longer.</v>

1982
00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.080
<v Speaker 1>Never go full retail.</v>

1983
00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1984
00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.390
<v Speaker 1>There's something that happens to people when they get that cuckoo Fayez you</v>

1985
00:55:54.391 --> 00:55:54.541
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

00:55:54.541 --> 00:55:56.040
<v Speaker 1>they get that over the top.</v>

1987
00:55:56.041 --> 00:55:57.000
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't vivas</v>

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Let him like very briefly,</v>

2035
00:57:07.291 --> 00:57:08.190
<v Speaker 1>we had headphones on.</v>

2036
00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:08.400
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2037
00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:09.233
<v Speaker 1>they shook our hands.</v>

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How are you doing?</v>

2041
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.760
<v Speaker 1>And then the fight was going on,</v>

2042
00:57:12.150 --> 00:57:12.840
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2043
00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:17.460
<v Speaker 1>no one could ask anyone to be able to handle that situation any better than that</v>

2044
00:57:17.461 --> 00:57:18.294
<v Speaker 1>kid's doing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Way better than I would do.</v>

2047
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:25.170
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine what fucking damage you would have done that famous?</v>

2048
00:57:25.171 --> 00:57:27.610
<v Speaker 4>It's 17 that must be ridiculous.</v>

2049
00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.850
<v Speaker 4>I did enough time to get 17 and I was</v>

2050
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:32.640
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

2051
00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.960
<v Speaker 4>what kind of life is that?</v>

2052
00:57:33.961 --> 00:57:35.400
<v Speaker 4>That's that guy lives.</v>

2053
00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:35.791
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2054
00:57:35.791 --> 00:57:37.560
<v Speaker 4>there's only one person on the planet</v>

2055
00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:38.410
<v Speaker 1>that lives like that.</v>

2056
00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:39.243
<v Speaker 1>That's him.</v>

2057
00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Like who is he going to compare notes with?</v>

2058
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.320
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who's going to understand his life.</v>

2059
00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:47.290
<v Speaker 4>Like Britney Spears was that kind of level at one point.</v>

2060
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:49.630
<v Speaker 4>You know what happened to her?</v>

2061
00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:50.450
<v Speaker 4>She went crazy.</v>

2062
00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:51.283
<v Speaker 4>She blew a fuse.</v>

2063
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:54.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of excited for it just to be with sort of to lose his mind as well,</v>

2064
00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:57.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's just how is it going to happen,</v>

2067
00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 4>money in the bank?</v>

<v Speaker 1>you became unbelievably famous while you were a child.</v>

2081
00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:26.120
<v Speaker 1>How could you possibly handle that hanging out with Michael Jackson?</v>

2082
00:58:28.070 --> 00:58:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

2083
00:58:30.080 --> 00:58:30.321
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2084
00:58:30.321 --> 00:58:31.670
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy who got arrested.</v>

2085
00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:33.500
<v Speaker 1>He was like one of those famous,</v>

2086
00:58:33.501 --> 00:58:33.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2087
00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood,</v>

2088
00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:35.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2089
00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:36.960
<v Speaker 1>like investigative guys,</v>

2090
00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:38.480
<v Speaker 1>like a strong arm investigator.</v>

2091
00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:39.560
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

2092
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.890
<v Speaker 1>he had done some work with Michael Jackson and that the war,</v>

2093
00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:47.920
<v Speaker 1>what he says is that he wanted to check in and make sure that all the</v>

2094
00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.690
<v Speaker 1>molestation allegations were,</v>

2095
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:52.280
<v Speaker 1>were incorrect,</v>

2096
00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:57.020
<v Speaker 1>and he said he wouldn't work with Michael Jackson because he did something worse</v>

2097
00:58:57.021 --> 00:58:57.854
<v Speaker 1>than molest them.</v>

2098
00:58:59.110 --> 00:58:59.750
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2099
00:58:59.750 --> 00:59:02.420
<v Speaker 1>what that means know,</v>

2100
00:59:02.421 --> 00:59:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even imagine what the fuck that means,</v>

2101
00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.940
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough spin on things.</v>

2102
00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:09.560
<v Speaker 1>It was enough that he wouldn't,</v>

2103
00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:10.580
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't work with a guy.</v>

2104
00:59:11.330 --> 00:59:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2105
00:59:12.140 --> 00:59:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's true.</v>

2106
00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:13.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2107
00:59:13.491 --> 00:59:14.150
<v Speaker 1>he's in jail.</v>

2108
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:17.090
<v Speaker 1>The guy who did is in jail and he did a lot of nefarious,</v>

2109
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:22.000
<v Speaker 1>semi illegal type shit until a strong arm.</v>

2110
00:59:22.001 --> 00:59:22.350

<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2112
00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:27.390
<v Speaker 1>But it seems like you had a little bit of a code and it seems like a whatever</v>

2113
00:59:27.391 --> 00:59:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson was doing according to him,</v>

2114
00:59:29.611 --> 00:59:30.444
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

2115

2118
00:59:34.921 --> 00:59:37.050

2153
01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>pull up the interview cause it's pretty fascinating.</v>

2154
01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>And then don't worry folks,</v>

2155
01:00:27.421 --> 01:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>we're still going to talk about the spirit world.</v>

2156
01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I know we got off subject but the same,</v>

01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:38.573
<v Speaker 1>I know people want to hear.</v>

2165
01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Like while the show's going on too many people would just write fucked up shit</v>

2178
01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>They were in there for 10 years.</v>

2179
01:01:01.530 --> 01:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>These guys were holding them captive for 10 years.</v>

2180
01:01:04.921 --> 01:01:09.921
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck happens to people that allows them to do something like that?</v>

2181
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.140
<v Speaker 6>I Dunno.</v>

2182
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:12.950
<v Speaker 6>I Dunno.</v>

2183
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:15.530
<v Speaker 6>Like w w is what is their view of the world?</v>

2184
01:01:15.531 --> 01:01:16.190
<v Speaker 6>Like how,</v>

2185
01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:17.630
<v Speaker 6>how do they see their own actions?</v>

2186
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:19.640
<v Speaker 1>How did they get to be that thing?</v>

2187
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2188
01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:20.661
<v Speaker 1>How did they,</v>

2189
01:01:20.661 --> 01:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>that's the real question.</v>

2190
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.251
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2191
01:01:22.251 --> 01:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>who did something to them,</v>

2192
01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>they must have,</v>

2193
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.730
<v Speaker 1>they must have peace with it in some way.</v>

2194
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:27.703
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>

2195
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>

2196
01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>

2197
01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:29.870
<v Speaker 1>So have second thoughts,</v>

2198
01:01:29.871 --> 01:01:30.620
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2199
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2200
01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:31.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think,</v>

2201
01:01:31.971 --> 01:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I think they were just,</v>

2202
01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:33.321
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

2203
01:01:33.321 --> 01:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>they own them,</v>

2204
01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>that they were going to keep it that way.</v>

2205
01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>But how do you come to the conclusion that that's okay?</v>

2206
01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2207
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:40.303
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2208
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't imagine</v>

2209
01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.660
<v Speaker 6>I have this conversation with,</v>

2210
01:01:43.661 --> 01:01:45.310
<v Speaker 6>with the people about Michael Vick.</v>

2211
01:01:45.311 --> 01:01:45.810
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2212
01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:48.580
<v Speaker 6>I'm always kind of vocal about that and that situation with the dog.</v>

2213
01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.533
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>How?</v>

2218
01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.111
<v Speaker 1>Pause it for a second.</v>

2219
01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:54.501
<v Speaker 1>Cause I want to,</v>

2220
01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I want you to hear what you said.</v>

2221
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:56.960
<v Speaker 1>I have to say about this cause yeah,</v>

2222
01:01:57.010 --> 01:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2223
01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.330
<v Speaker 1>that disturbs the shit out of me too.</v>

2224
01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:00.523
<v Speaker 1>They had the Michael Vick.</v>

2225
01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:01.081
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2226
01:02:01.081 --> 01:02:02.160
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's like I went,</v>

2227
01:02:02.161 --> 01:02:02.731
<v Speaker 6>I was up in,</v>

2228
01:02:02.731 --> 01:02:03.080
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2229
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.370
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2230
01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:06.060
<v Speaker 6>Utah a couple of weeks ago for the victory Doug's reunion,</v>

2231
01:02:06.061 --> 01:02:07.020
<v Speaker 6>which is basically the,</v>

2232
01:02:07.021 --> 01:02:07.950
<v Speaker 6>the dogs that were,</v>

2233
01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:08.760
<v Speaker 6>were saved.</v>

2234
01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.170
<v Speaker 6>I think they took 58.</v>

2235
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:11.730
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2236
01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:13.680
<v Speaker 6>some of them were euthanized because they were too bad.</v>

2237
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:14.580
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2238
01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.190
<v Speaker 6>but most of them were taken to a place called the best friends animal sanctuary.</v>

2239
01:02:17.191 --> 01:02:18.024
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

2240
01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 6>some of them will stay there for the rest of their lives</v>

2241
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:22.470
<v Speaker 4>because they can't be with other dogs and you know,</v>

2242
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:23.483
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

2243
01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:24.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2244
01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.970
<v Speaker 4>Like the grand champions and stuff,</v>

2245
01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:27.630
<v Speaker 4>they all scarred up and stuff,</v>

2246
01:02:27.631 --> 01:02:28.500
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of them got,</v>

2247
01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:28.890
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2248
01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 4>got adopted and all the family stay quite close and they,</v>

2249
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2250
01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:34.020
<v Speaker 4>they bring the dogs together so they can socialize.</v>

2251
01:02:34.021 --> 01:02:34.950
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

2252
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:37.350
<v Speaker 4>like some of these dogs that got chemical burns on their back,</v>

2253
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:40.560
<v Speaker 4>there's one little dog that walks sideways because it was thrown against a wall</v>

2254
01:02:40.561 --> 01:02:41.394
<v Speaker 4>as a puppy.</v>

2255
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:41.991
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2256
01:02:41.991 --> 01:02:42.380
<v Speaker 4>like how,</v>

2257
01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 4>how do you get to the stage where you think that that's an all right thing to</v>

2258
01:02:44.881 --> 01:02:45.714
<v Speaker 4>do?</v>

2259
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:46.760
<v Speaker 4>Like that's,</v>

2260
01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:47.250
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

2261
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.760
<v Speaker 4>you don't get better from that.</v>

2262
01:02:48.761 --> 01:02:49.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's not something that you're,</v>

2263
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.120
<v Speaker 4>now he's got another dog,</v>

2264
01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:53.550
<v Speaker 4>like he showed up in a pet smart or the day without this,</v>

2265
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:56.220
<v Speaker 4>it's like some kind of military dog.</v>

2266
01:02:56.310 --> 01:02:59.750
<v Speaker 4>He shouldn't have been that it was anything right with the world that Doug's</v>

2267
01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.110
<v Speaker 4>going to go for his throat at some point.</v>

2268
01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:02.670
<v Speaker 4>Was He allowed to have dogs?</v>

2269
01:03:02.671 --> 01:03:03.504
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous.</v>

2270
01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.070
<v Speaker 4>All the dogs he killed.</v>

2271
01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:05.551
<v Speaker 4>But you don't,</v>

2272
01:03:05.551 --> 01:03:06.990
<v Speaker 4>you don't heal from something like that.</v>

2273
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:07.824
<v Speaker 4>That's something that,</v>

2274
01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.290
<v Speaker 4>that's just something that's,</v>

2275
01:03:09.300 --> 01:03:10.140
<v Speaker 4>that's who you are.</v>

2276
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:11.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2277
01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:11.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2278
01:03:11.590 --> 01:03:12.423
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

2279
01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:15.390
<v Speaker 4>what is the story that he killed a bunch of them,</v>

2280
01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:15.660
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2281

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2282
01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:16.441

01:03:16.441 --> 01:03:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Them throwing them on the floor.</v>

2284
01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:20.100
<v Speaker 4>Electrocuting them hanging them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>he had a bad reputation in the dog fight and community.</v>

2290
01:03:25.790 --> 01:03:26.101

01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:33.240
<v Speaker 4>He had a bad reputation and the dog fighting community,</v>

2295
01:03:33.241 --> 01:03:33.661
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2296
01:03:33.661 --> 01:03:36.690
<v Speaker 4>your con when the dog fighting world is like,</v>

2297
01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

2298
01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.460
<v Speaker 4>I need to sell the fuck down.</v>

2299
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:39.600
<v Speaker 4>You're being mean.</v>

2300
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:40.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2301
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:40.501
<v Speaker 4>That's some,</v>

2302
01:03:40.501 --> 01:03:40.950
<v Speaker 4>that's an,</v>

2303
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 4>that's a whole new level of mean.</v>

2304
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:43.440
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>

2305
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:44.041
<v Speaker 4>I have a,</v>

2306
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.750
<v Speaker 4>I have a friend who adopted one of his dogs.</v>

2307
01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.500
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2308
01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.333
<v Speaker 4>this little dog,</v>

2309
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.230
<v Speaker 4>when you take into a room,</v>

2310
01:03:49.231 --> 01:03:50.820
<v Speaker 4>it will go and sit in the corner and shake.</v>

2311
01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:51.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

2312
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:52.540
<v Speaker 4>And it just,</v>

2313
01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.830
<v Speaker 4>you can't go near it without it just shaking uncontrollably.</v>

2314
01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:56.950
<v Speaker 4>And that was a,</v>

2315
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:57.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2316
01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:58.440
<v Speaker 4>I think they call them bait dogs.</v>

2317
01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:02.370
<v Speaker 4>We're basically a muzzle on the dog and use it as like a confidence builder for</v>

2318
01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:02.780
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2319
01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:03.840
<v Speaker 4>the fight in dogs.</v>

2320
01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:04.674
<v Speaker 4>They're successful.</v>

2321
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:05.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

2322
01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:06.453
<v Speaker 4>So it,</v>

2323
01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:08.460
<v Speaker 4>but the size of the dog that they bullied.</v>

2324
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:08.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2325
01:04:08.910 --> 01:04:09.640
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2326
01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:12.510
<v Speaker 4>But this guy has got another dog now and he's back playing football and</v>

2327
01:04:12.511 --> 01:04:14.760
<v Speaker 4>everyone's called because he's an athlete and you know,</v>

2328
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:15.810
<v Speaker 4>that's not,</v>

2329
01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.190
<v Speaker 4>that's not a normal human being.</v>

2330
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.323
<v Speaker 4>That's not,</v>

2331
01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:18.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2332
01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:19.560
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2333
01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.171
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2334
01:04:20.171 --> 01:04:21.900
<v Speaker 4>It's not a regular calculation to make.</v>

2335
01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:22.201
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2336
01:04:22.201 --> 01:04:22.671
<v Speaker 4>it's also,</v>

2337
01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:25.140
<v Speaker 4>it's when do you forgive?</v>

2338
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.030
<v Speaker 4>There's certain things that we don't forgive.</v>

2339
01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:27.420
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2340
01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:27.811
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2341
01:04:27.811 --> 01:04:29.340
<v Speaker 4>we don't forgive Charlamagne's thing.</v>

2342
01:04:29.610 --> 01:04:31.140
<v Speaker 4>No one forgets that when,</v>

2343
01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:33.150
<v Speaker 4>when a person wants to rape kids,</v>

2344
01:04:33.151 --> 01:04:35.480
<v Speaker 4>like you're off the menu for civilization.</v>

2345
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.440
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much universal.</v>

2346
01:04:36.441 --> 01:04:37.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2347
01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:38.460
<v Speaker 4>But when you,</v>

2348
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.540
<v Speaker 4>when you look at what some people are willing to accept,</v>

2349
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:45.820
<v Speaker 4>when it's clearly that's,</v>

2350
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:49.230
<v Speaker 4>there's like a sociopathic characteristic to that.</v>

2351
01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:49.651
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

2352
01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:51.450
<v Speaker 4>there's a cruelty characteristic.</v>

2353
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:54.150
<v Speaker 4>But can a guy I learned from that we know we don't,</v>

2354
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.310
<v Speaker 4>they can't learn from childbirth.</v>

2355
01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:57.203
<v Speaker 4>They can't,</v>

2356
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.430
<v Speaker 4>there's the recidivism rate is way too high.</v>

2357
01:04:59.490 --> 01:05:00.211
<v Speaker 4>Whatever it is.</v>

2358
01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:01.044
<v Speaker 4>It's way too sick.</v>

2359
01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:03.240
<v Speaker 4>The danger that they pose is way too great.</v>

2360
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:04.920
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's too much at stake.</v>

2361
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:09.700
<v Speaker 4>But the idea is like a guy that used to treat dogs like their shit and kill</v>

2362
01:05:09.701 --> 01:05:10.440
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2363
01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.300
<v Speaker 4>Should we give that guy a second chance?</v>

2364
01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.870
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is I don't think he can change his opinion on his actions.</v>

2365
01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:16.590
<v Speaker 4>All I can,</v>

2366
01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:18.450
<v Speaker 4>all I can think you can do is realize</v>

2367
01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:20.280
<v Speaker 6>that other people don't find that acceptable.</v>

2368
01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:21.001
<v Speaker 6>Well yeah,</v>

2369
01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:21.511
<v Speaker 6>there's that.</v>

2370
01:05:21.511 --> 01:05:22.890
<v Speaker 6>But there's also that he,</v>

2371
01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:23.490
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2372
01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:24.301
<v Speaker 6>his culture,</v>

2373
01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:25.320
<v Speaker 6>like he grew up,</v>

2374
01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:26.680
<v Speaker 6>like when he,</v>

2375
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:28.080
<v Speaker 6>from the time he was a little boy,</v>

2376
01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:29.700
<v Speaker 6>like they had dog fights.</v>

2377
01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:34.050
<v Speaker 6>Like there's a lot of people in this world today that's still engage in like</v>

2378
01:05:34.051 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 6>really regular dogfights.</v>

2379
01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.090
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2380
01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:40.230
<v Speaker 6>And if you are unlucky enough to be born in that environment,</v>

2381
01:05:40.350 --> 01:05:42.450
<v Speaker 6>when do you make your own moral distinction?</v>

2382
01:05:42.451 --> 01:05:45.000
<v Speaker 6>Like when do you realize that this is a terrible thing?</v>

2383
01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:47.010
<v Speaker 6>But even so there's dog fighting and Doug fine.</v>

2384
01:05:47.011 --> 01:05:48.390
<v Speaker 6>I mean like if you read,</v>

2385
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:49.110
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2386
01:05:49.110 --> 01:05:50.160
<v Speaker 6>Psalm Sheridan's book,</v>

2387
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.350
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2388
01:05:50.350 --> 01:05:51.230
<v Speaker 6>fights is heart.</v>

2389
01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.220
<v Speaker 6>There's a bit about dog fighting in there and they say,</v>

2390
01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:53.630
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2391
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:54.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't agree with it,</v>

2392
01:05:54.481 --> 01:05:54.991
<v Speaker 6>but it's a very,</v>

2393
01:05:54.991 --> 01:05:56.160
<v Speaker 6>very different perspective.</v>

2394
01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:56.671
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2395
01:05:56.671 --> 01:05:57.540
<v Speaker 6>that care for the dogs,</v>

2396
01:05:57.541 --> 01:05:58.291
<v Speaker 6>they look after them,</v>

2397
01:05:58.291 --> 01:06:00.870
<v Speaker 6>they buy them the best food and you know,</v>

2398
01:06:00.871 --> 01:06:01.740
<v Speaker 6>really take care of them.</v>

2399
01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.360
<v Speaker 6>And the dogs fight for fairness,</v>

2400
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.730
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2401
01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:04.563
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2402
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:05.341
<v Speaker 6>Which I mean,</v>

2403
01:06:05.341 --> 01:06:07.110
<v Speaker 6>it's still a kind of an unusual perspective,</v>

2404
01:06:07.111 --> 01:06:07.350
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

2405
01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:09.570
<v Speaker 6>but the stuff that Vic was doing was just evil,</v>

2406
01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.433
<v Speaker 6>evil,</v>

2407
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:11.940
<v Speaker 6>which is a whole new level entirely.</v>

2408
01:06:11.941 --> 01:06:13.290
<v Speaker 6>And that's the kind of stuff that you,</v>

2409
01:06:13.291 --> 01:06:14.124
<v Speaker 6>that you can't,</v>

2410
01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:15.380
<v Speaker 6>you can't heal from either thing.</v>

2411
01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:15.730
<v Speaker 6>That's,</v>

2412
01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:16.770
<v Speaker 6>that's the person that he is.</v>

2413
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:18.630
<v Speaker 6>I met him once and I didn't know who he was.</v>

2414
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.711
<v Speaker 6>I met him backstage.</v>

2415
01:06:19.711 --> 01:06:20.280
<v Speaker 6>I'm glad I went.</v>

2416
01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't meet him now because I don't,</v>

2417
01:06:22.711 --> 01:06:24.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't know that I'd want to be anywhere near him.</v>

2418
01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:24.821
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2419
01:06:24.821 --> 01:06:25.654
<v Speaker 6>it just,</v>

2420
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:26.813
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2421
01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:28.260
<v Speaker 6>how'd you feel when you met him?</v>

2422
01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.300
<v Speaker 6>I didn't know who he was.</v>

2423
01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:31.020
<v Speaker 6>He's just,</v>

2424
01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:31.853
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2425
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:35.470
<v Speaker 6>When my friend confronted him about what he'd done to the dogs,</v>

2426
01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:39.450
<v Speaker 6>he said he was hoping for some kind of like aggressive reaction like he was</v>

2427
01:06:39.451 --> 01:06:39.640
<v Speaker 6>going,</v>

2428
01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.740
<v Speaker 6>he was hoping that the guy,</v>

2429
01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:43.050
<v Speaker 6>that the guy was at least going to have a feeling about it.</v>

2430
01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:43.861
<v Speaker 6>He said,</v>

2431
01:06:43.861 --> 01:06:44.250
<v Speaker 6>but when,</v>

2432
01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.960
<v Speaker 6>whatever he was telling the guy,</v>

2433
01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:47.940
<v Speaker 6>whatever he was talking to Michael Vick about,</v>

2434
01:06:47.941 --> 01:06:48.960
<v Speaker 6>Vic was just like,</v>

2435
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:50.933
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

2436
01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:51.540

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:48.700
<v Speaker 1>You do with those guys.</v>

2531
01:09:48.970 --> 01:09:49.803

2534
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:53.170
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2535
01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>but then you think there's something,</v>

2536
01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:56.860
<v Speaker 1>kind of send a story about like laying Suni down on the,</v>

2537
01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:58.030
<v Speaker 1>on a,</v>

2538
01:09:58.030 --> 01:10:00.320
<v Speaker 1>on a bed and injecting them into light light.</v>

2539
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Put them,</v>

01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:01.810
<v Speaker 1>put them down.</v>

2541
01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:02.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's necessarily,</v>

2542
01:10:02.681 --> 01:10:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I think you just dig a hole,</v>

2543
01:10:04.121 --> 01:10:04.870
<v Speaker 1>shoot him in the head,</v>

2544
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:05.703
<v Speaker 1>push him in the hole.</v>

2545
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.290
<v Speaker 1>I really don't think you need to be fucking with all this injection.</v>

2546
01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.210

2547
01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.170

2552
01:10:18.370 --> 01:10:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Let's can do a nice and easy little poison.</v>

2560
01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.350

<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2581
01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.370
<v Speaker 1>It's real simple.</v>

2582
01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:01.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a bad person.</v>

2583
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.830
<v Speaker 1>He's broken.</v>

2584
01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.120
<v Speaker 1>We got to get rid of them.</v>

2585
01:11:04.330 --> 01:11:05.163
<v Speaker 1>Shoot them.</v>

2586
01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:05.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2587
01:11:05.441 --> 01:11:06.274
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

2588
01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.050
<v Speaker 1>Like they do on the walking dead.</v>

2589
01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.110
<v Speaker 3>I think they should be put them in a trough first at like a Skinner,</v>

2590
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:13.890
<v Speaker 3>the concert and we all get to like piss on them for it or something,</v>

2591
01:11:13.891 --> 01:11:13.980
<v Speaker 3>you</v>

2592
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:14.101
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

2593
01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:15.510
<v Speaker 6>like something cool like that first.</v>

2594
01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:16.373
<v Speaker 6>That's not cool.</v>

2595
01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:17.970
<v Speaker 6>That's just weird.</v>

2596
01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:18.841
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2597
01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:19.690
<v Speaker 6>it was pissed off.</v>

2598
01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:21.180
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

2599
01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:21.931
<v Speaker 6>what do you want to do today?</v>

2600
01:11:21.931 --> 01:11:22.621
<v Speaker 6>So I'm cool.</v>

2601
01:11:22.621 --> 01:11:23.490
<v Speaker 6>It's beside each other.</v>

2602
01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.070
<v Speaker 6>So tell me about your journey in the jungle.</v>

2603
01:11:32.370 --> 01:11:32.701
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2604
01:11:32.701 --> 01:11:33.071
<v Speaker 6>What was the,</v>

2605
01:11:33.071 --> 01:11:33.780
<v Speaker 6>was that all about?</v>

2606
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:34.613
<v Speaker 6>What happened?</v>

2607
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:36.570
<v Speaker 6>What caused you to want to do this?</v>

2608
01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:37.950
<v Speaker 6>I don't really know.</v>

2609
01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:39.301
<v Speaker 6>I don't really know.</v>

2610
01:11:39.301 --> 01:11:39.840
<v Speaker 6>I just felt,</v>

2611
01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.850
<v Speaker 6>I felt like I was drawn to it.</v>

2612
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.713
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2613
01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.280
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

2614
01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.370
<v Speaker 6>I was speaking to a friend of mine,</v>

2615
01:11:44.371 --> 01:11:44.941
<v Speaker 6>I won't mention him,</v>

2616
01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:45.810
<v Speaker 6>but he's under the fighter.</v>

2617
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm retired now.</v>

2618
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:47.860
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2619
01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:48.190
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

2620
01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:50.130
<v Speaker 6>and he did a couple of ceremonies in London,</v>

2621
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.660
<v Speaker 6>a friend's place.</v>

2622
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:52.980
<v Speaker 6>They brought a sham it over and,</v>

2623
01:11:52.981 --> 01:11:53.280
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2624
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:53.781
<v Speaker 6>did a couple of,</v>

2625
01:11:53.781 --> 01:11:57.240
<v Speaker 6>and I've always been kind of the guy that if I wanted to experience something,</v>

2626
01:11:57.241 --> 01:11:58.260
<v Speaker 6>I would go to the source.</v>

2627
01:11:58.261 --> 01:11:58.680
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2628
01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.220
<v Speaker 6>I would like,</v>

2629
01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 6>like if I wanted to do kung feel,</v>

2630
01:12:00.841 --> 01:12:02.600
<v Speaker 6>I go to China and if I want to rest,</v>

2631
01:12:02.601 --> 01:12:04.350
<v Speaker 6>I come to America and you know,</v>

2632
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:06.450
<v Speaker 6>if I want to try Ios guy I go to Peru.</v>

2633
01:12:06.451 --> 01:12:07.530
<v Speaker 6>It just kind of made sense.</v>

2634
01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:08.364
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2635
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:09.383
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2636
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:12.900
<v Speaker 6>it was kind of like my reward for getting through the Catlin,</v>

2637
01:12:12.930 --> 01:12:14.160
<v Speaker 6>the Duane Ludwig camp,</v>

2638
01:12:14.370 --> 01:12:15.450
<v Speaker 6>because that was obviously,</v>

2639
01:12:15.451 --> 01:12:16.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2640
01:12:16.110 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 6>that would have been a loss in a row and obviously a complete changing career</v>

2641
01:12:20.821 --> 01:12:21.654
<v Speaker 6>paths.</v>

2642
01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.440
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2643
01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.271
<v Speaker 6>so I just kind of,</v>

2644
01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:23.431
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2645
01:12:23.431 --> 01:12:25.970
<v Speaker 6>I put 12 weeks aside to dedicate myself to that fight.</v>

2646
01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:27.570
<v Speaker 6>And you know,</v>

2647
01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.381
<v Speaker 6>with that as a,</v>

2648
01:12:28.381 --> 01:12:30.420
<v Speaker 6>as a reward after in a couple of days after the fight,</v>

2649
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.000
<v Speaker 6>I flew out and spent two weeks there,</v>

2650
01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:38.090
<v Speaker 6>did a tobacco ceremony on the first day three Ios because ceremonies and to San</v>

2651
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:39.893
<v Speaker 6>Pedro ceremonies,</v>

2652
01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.950
<v Speaker 6>how's that tea ceremony?</v>

2653
01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.280
<v Speaker 6>They basically make a drink of uh,</v>

2654
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:47.941
<v Speaker 6>tobacco,</v>

2655
01:12:47.941 --> 01:12:52.620
<v Speaker 6>coffee and sugar and they cook it up and then you drink a whole load of it and</v>

2656
01:12:52.621 --> 01:12:53.311
<v Speaker 6>it's like a purge,</v>

2657
01:12:53.311 --> 01:12:54.150
<v Speaker 6>like a detox.</v>

2658
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:56.220
<v Speaker 6>Like if you've got any kind of toxins in your system,</v>

2659
01:12:56.221 --> 01:13:00.270
<v Speaker 6>you throw up when you sweat and some people will crying and obviously there's</v>

2660
01:13:00.271 --> 01:13:02.250
<v Speaker 6>all kinds of other nasty stuff that goes on as well.</v>

2661
01:13:02.251 --> 01:13:02.810
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

2662
01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:03.430
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2663
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.791
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

2664
01:13:03.791 --> 01:13:04.080
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2665
01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:07.800
<v Speaker 6>it's a way of like cleansing your body before the Ios go theoretical cleansing</v>

2666
01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:09.240
<v Speaker 6>or does it actually have a cleansing effect?</v>

2667
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:10.050
<v Speaker 6>It's got a client,</v>

2668
01:13:10.050 --> 01:13:11.170
<v Speaker 6>fortunately had been in,</v>

2669
01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.420
<v Speaker 6>in training camp for 12 weeks,</v>

2670
01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 6>so I'd been on a clean diet and I just,</v>

2671
01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:15.520
<v Speaker 6>I just kept my diet clean until I've,</v>

2672
01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:18.330
<v Speaker 6>I've got to Peru because there's a special diet for,</v>

2673
01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 6>for the ios because it's a low,</v>

2674
01:13:20.701 --> 01:13:21.980
<v Speaker 6>a acidic diet,</v>

2675
01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:22.814
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2676
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:24.571
<v Speaker 6>Sugar,</v>

2677
01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:25.590
<v Speaker 6>no oils,</v>

2678
01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:26.791
<v Speaker 6>no sex,</v>

2679
01:13:26.791 --> 01:13:27.660
<v Speaker 6>no spices,</v>

2680
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:28.621
<v Speaker 6>oils,</v>

2681
01:13:28.621 --> 01:13:29.454
<v Speaker 6>oils,</v>

2682
01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:31.410
<v Speaker 6>oils.</v>

2683
01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:32.243
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2684
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.881
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2685
01:13:32.881 --> 01:13:33.110
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2686
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.700
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting.</v>

2687
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:34.410
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2688
01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.460
<v Speaker 6>there are a lot of things,</v>

2689
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:39.420
<v Speaker 6>a lot of things on the list that I'm Kinda on the fence about and it's kind of,</v>

2690
01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.210
<v Speaker 6>it's weird because there's not really any kind of science behind it.</v>

2691
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:42.361
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2692
01:13:42.361 --> 01:13:45.810
<v Speaker 6>there are some things that you can't have because they react badly with the,</v>

2693
01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:46.520
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

2694
01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:47.311
<v Speaker 6>with the medicine.</v>

2695
01:13:47.311 --> 01:13:47.670
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

2696
01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:48.480
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2697
01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:50.160
<v Speaker 6>some of the foods are kind of kind of odd.</v>

2698
01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.200
<v Speaker 6>I just kind of go on instinct when I'm,</v>

2699
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:54.390
<v Speaker 6>when I'm dieting for it right now.</v>

2700
01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:56.520
<v Speaker 6>So the tobacco ceremony,</v>

2701
01:13:56.530 --> 01:13:57.870
<v Speaker 6>there's no psychoactive effect,</v>

2702
01:13:57.871 --> 01:13:58.704
<v Speaker 6>no nothing.</v>

2703
01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.720
<v Speaker 6>It's just like,</v>

2704
01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.910
<v Speaker 6>it's just like smoking three packets of cigarettes and drinking six Starbucks</v>

2705
01:14:02.911 --> 01:14:03.744
<v Speaker 6>all at the same time.</v>

2706
01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:05.930
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like the future of Syria.</v>

2707
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:08.430
<v Speaker 6>I don't drink coffee.</v>

2708
01:14:08.431 --> 01:14:10.320
<v Speaker 6>I don't drink caffeine or obviously smoke cigarettes.</v>

2709
01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:11.154
<v Speaker 6>So I'm like,</v>

2710
01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:14.920
<v Speaker 6>I'm like sitting in my room like shaking and sweating.</v>

2711
01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:16.840
<v Speaker 6>It was kind of uncomfortable.</v>

2712
01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:18.461
<v Speaker 6>But once that was over,</v>

2713
01:14:18.461 --> 01:14:19.171
<v Speaker 6>the next day was,</v>

2714
01:14:19.171 --> 01:14:22.510
<v Speaker 6>was the first ios because homeowner and I did feel real sharp the next morning.</v>

2715
01:14:22.570 --> 01:14:23.403
<v Speaker 6>I felt very,</v>

2716
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:24.363
<v Speaker 6>very alone.</v>

2717
01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:25.031
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2718
01:14:25.031 --> 01:14:27.180
<v Speaker 6>So the next morning you do the ILS get ceremony.</v>

2719
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:28.083
<v Speaker 6>What was that like?</v>

2720
01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:28.570
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2721
01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:32.530
<v Speaker 6>well you don't need a great deal of during the day we had a light breakfast and</v>

2722
01:14:32.531 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 6>then,</v>

2723
01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:33.251
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2724
01:14:33.251 --> 01:14:33.590
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2725
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.910
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

2726
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:37.660
<v Speaker 6>like a fruit snack around mid day and then after that you fast and the ceremony</v>

2727
01:14:37.661 --> 01:14:38.620
<v Speaker 6>starts to 8:00 PM.</v>

2728
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:39.790
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2729
01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:42.580
<v Speaker 6>so the idea is that you go into the ceremony with intentions,</v>

2730
01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:43.510
<v Speaker 6>that things that you wanted,</v>

2731
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:44.310
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2732
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:45.550
<v Speaker 6>question questions you want to ask.</v>

2733
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:46.783
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2734
01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:47.540
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

2735
01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:48.790
<v Speaker 6>there's always this talk about,</v>

2736
01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:48.950
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2737
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:49.390
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>

2738
01:14:49.390 --> 01:14:49.750
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2739
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:51.200
<v Speaker 6>ios because the spirit of Ios,</v>

2740
01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:51.730
<v Speaker 6>Sca,</v>

2741
01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:55.870
<v Speaker 6>mother I Alaska and some people during their experiences have an interaction</v>

2742
01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:58.660
<v Speaker 6>with a female entity of some point that was of some sort,</v>

2743
01:14:58.661 --> 01:14:59.494
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't,</v>

2744
01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.140
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

2745
01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.880
<v Speaker 6>but the intentions are still very important.</v>

2746
01:15:03.881 --> 01:15:05.290
<v Speaker 6>Going into the ceremony with,</v>

2747
01:15:05.370 --> 01:15:05.890
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2748
01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:06.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2749
01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:09.730
<v Speaker 6>with questions about myself or my life or whatever,</v>

2750
01:15:09.731 --> 01:15:11.200
<v Speaker 6>really for me,</v>

2751
01:15:11.201 --> 01:15:14.280
<v Speaker 6>the answer's just Kinda just kinda manifested.</v>

2752
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.220
<v Speaker 6>It just kind of show up.</v>

2753
01:15:15.221 --> 01:15:18.190
<v Speaker 6>I just kind of all of a sudden getting an overwhelming feeling of,</v>

2754
01:15:18.191 --> 01:15:18.431
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

2755
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:19.264
<v Speaker 6>of the right,</v>

2756
01:15:19.930 --> 01:15:20.763
<v Speaker 6>the right answer.</v>

2757
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 6>I don't really know how to explain it better than that.</v>

2758
01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.790
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of the problem is that I really feel like we've,</v>

2759
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:27.550
<v Speaker 6>we've not got the language to explain this kind of stuff at the moment.</v>

2760
01:15:27.551 --> 01:15:28.360
<v Speaker 6>We need,</v>

2761
01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 6>we need to expand it,</v>

2762
01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:30.730
<v Speaker 6>our vocabulary to,</v>

2763
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:32.320
<v Speaker 6>to encompass all the,</v>

2764
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.920
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2765
01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.960
<v Speaker 6>all the stuff that we were experiencing these things.</v>

2766
01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:35.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2767
01:15:35.351 --> 01:15:39.730
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people believe that what a psychedelic states,</v>

2768
01:15:39.731 --> 01:15:43.420
<v Speaker 1>even if they don't believe in that you're really contacting the spirit world,</v>

2769
01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>what they think you're doing by forcing yourself to,</v>

2770
01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:49.720
<v Speaker 1>to take a hard look at yourself and,</v>

2771
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.991
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2772
01:15:49.991 --> 01:15:52.690
<v Speaker 1>address some questions that you might have one way or another.</v>

2773
01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:57.010
<v Speaker 1>But to do it with this stuff that absorb it absolves your ego.</v>

2774
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:58.330
<v Speaker 1>It removes the ego.</v>

2775
01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And in doing that,</v>

2776
01:15:59.801 --> 01:16:02.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a rare state that you get to get the fuck away from your ego,</v>

2777
01:16:02.890 --> 01:16:06.430
<v Speaker 1>but it really lets you get away from it to a point where you can see things so</v>

2778
01:16:06.431 --> 01:16:07.270
<v Speaker 1>much more clearly.</v>

2779
01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2780
01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:11.260
<v Speaker 1>And you can realize how much of the ego is just been really been sort of</v>

2781
01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:15.580
<v Speaker 1>tricking you and deceiving you and making you believe that you're,</v>

2782
01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2783
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:17.860
<v Speaker 1>you're either something that you're not,</v>

2784
01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:21.100
<v Speaker 1>or you've gone further than you really actually have,</v>

2785
01:16:21.101 --> 01:16:25.250
<v Speaker 1>or your ego is allowed you to sort of delude yourself to,</v>

2786
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:26.021
<v Speaker 1>to get by.</v>

2787
01:16:26.021 --> 01:16:27.850
<v Speaker 1>That's very strenuous existence.</v>

2788
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:30.850
<v Speaker 1>And when you go into a psychedelic state,</v>

2789
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:33.760
<v Speaker 1>it allows you to bypass all that and see it.</v>

2790
01:16:33.850 --> 01:16:34.480
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't,</v>

2791
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:34.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2792
01:16:34.781 --> 01:16:36.070
<v Speaker 1>that that's where like,</v>

2793
01:16:36.071 --> 01:16:40.900
<v Speaker 1>people don't understand that you can get to a mild psychedelic state from</v>

2794
01:16:40.901 --> 01:16:41.980
<v Speaker 1>exercise and yoga.</v>

2795
01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:42.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2796
01:16:42.980 --> 01:16:43.341
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2797
01:16:43.341 --> 01:16:43.970
<v Speaker 6>fasting,</v>

2798
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:44.280
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2799
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.800
<v Speaker 6>Meditation and yeah,</v>

2800
01:16:46.050 --> 01:16:49.140
<v Speaker 1>you can get there just to sensory deprivation tanks.</v>

2801
01:16:49.141 --> 01:16:51.630
<v Speaker 1>You can get to a pretty extreme form with no drugs at all.</v>

2802
01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:57.380
<v Speaker 1>But the IOWASCA ceremony is basically known as prior the grand mall of a,</v>

2803
01:16:59.551 --> 01:17:01.110
<v Speaker 1>of the psychedelic experiences,</v>

2804
01:17:01.111 --> 01:17:04.140
<v Speaker 1>the most spiritual of the psychedelic experiences.</v>

2805
01:17:04.141 --> 01:17:04.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2806
01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:08.090
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty powerful in comparison to other things after I've experienced this.</v>

2807
01:17:08.730 --> 01:17:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever experienced the,</v>

2808
01:17:09.831 --> 01:17:10.060
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

2809
01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.380
<v Speaker 6>raw form of DMT?</v>

2810
01:17:11.381 --> 01:17:11.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2811
01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.753
<v Speaker 6>Only once though.</v>

2812
01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:16.270
<v Speaker 6>Was it five Meo DMT or was it an DMT?</v>

2813
01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:17.313
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2814
01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:18.430
<v Speaker 6>there's two different kinds.</v>

2815
01:17:18.431 --> 01:17:19.264
<v Speaker 6>One,</v>

2816
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.960
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

2817
01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.040
<v Speaker 6>Five meo yeah,</v>

2818
01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.750
<v Speaker 6>five Erminio is quite a bit different.</v>

2819
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:23.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2820
01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:23.560
<v Speaker 6>it's a,</v>

2821
01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.550
<v Speaker 6>there's no visuals.</v>

2822
01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:27.790
<v Speaker 6>It's a very intense feeling of connection and it's very,</v>

2823
01:17:27.791 --> 01:17:28.624
<v Speaker 6>very potent.</v>

2824
01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.231
<v Speaker 6>In fact,</v>

2825
01:17:29.231 --> 01:17:31.300
<v Speaker 6>I think it's like supposedly,</v>

2826
01:17:31.301 --> 01:17:33.040
<v Speaker 6>obviously I'm not some sort of a scientist here,</v>

2827
01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:33.520
<v Speaker 6>but a,</v>

2828
01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:38.290
<v Speaker 6>supposedly it's even more powerful gram per gram than DMT is.</v>

2829
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:39.880
<v Speaker 6>But the DMT,</v>

2830
01:17:39.881 --> 01:17:40.571
<v Speaker 6>the NMD,</v>

2831
01:17:40.571 --> 01:17:40.930
<v Speaker 6>mts,</v>

2832
01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:42.200
<v Speaker 6>what you're getting in the IOWASCA.</v>

2833
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:43.120
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2834
01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:43.931
<v Speaker 6>When you eat it,</v>

2835
01:17:43.931 --> 01:17:45.610
<v Speaker 6>if you tried to eat DMT,</v>

2836
01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.020
<v Speaker 6>there's a stomach,</v>

2837
01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:47.770
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2838
01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:48.820
<v Speaker 6>chemical produced your,</v>

2839
01:17:48.821 --> 01:17:49.440
<v Speaker 6>your,</v>

2840
01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.100
<v Speaker 6>your chemical,</v>

2841
01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:53.530
<v Speaker 6>your stomach produces something called Mano aimeen oxidase apparently.</v>

2842
01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.440
<v Speaker 6>And that breaks down DMT.</v>

2843
01:17:56.770 --> 01:18:00.580
<v Speaker 6>So with these brilliant people that live in the Amazon and figured out how to do</v>

2844
01:18:00.581 --> 01:18:05.581
<v Speaker 6>it was mixed the vine of one plant with the leaves of another and cook it all</v>

2845
01:18:06.011 --> 01:18:06.370
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>

2846
01:18:06.370 --> 01:18:10.530
<v Speaker 6>So they introduced a natural Mao inhibitor that not blow your mind.</v>

2847
01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:11.860
<v Speaker 6>It's insane.</v>

2848
01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:12.670
<v Speaker 6>Plays in mind.</v>

2849
01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:16.570
<v Speaker 6>Did you ask them how they figured it out and not Terence Mckenna did and he,</v>

2850
01:18:16.571 --> 01:18:19.150
<v Speaker 6>he said that they always said that the plants how to do it.</v>

2851
01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:20.480
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

2852
01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:21.890
<v Speaker 6>I've always thought about this with diet,</v>

2853
01:18:21.891 --> 01:18:22.700
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2854
01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.880
<v Speaker 6>like people who have been combining like incomplete proteins for years,</v>

2855
01:18:25.881 --> 01:18:28.580
<v Speaker 6>like milk and cereal and rice and beans and not,</v>

2856
01:18:28.610 --> 01:18:29.960
<v Speaker 6>not knowing that those,</v>

2857
01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.060
<v Speaker 6>those two things combined made a complete protein.</v>

2858
01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:34.280
<v Speaker 6>So why would they combine them?</v>

2859
01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:35.600
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2860
01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.051
<v Speaker 6>it's funny,</v>

2861
01:18:36.051 --> 01:18:36.231
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2862
01:18:36.231 --> 01:18:36.830
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's like,</v>

2863
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:37.171
<v Speaker 6>it's nice.</v>

2864
01:18:37.171 --> 01:18:38.390
<v Speaker 6>It's like an odd coincidence.</v>

2865
01:18:38.391 --> 01:18:41.390
<v Speaker 6>But I will ask is like the same thing but a way more extreme.</v>

2866
01:18:41.540 --> 01:18:41.830
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2867
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:42.790
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of folks</v>

2868
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:43.211
<v Speaker 1>bully,</v>

2869
01:18:43.211 --> 01:18:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say a lot of folks,</v>

2870
01:18:44.291 --> 01:18:45.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's been speculated.</v>

2871
01:18:45.611 --> 01:18:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I've read,</v>

2872
01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:46.923
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2873
01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:52.080
<v Speaker 1>read work where people believe that what we've created with civilization and</v>

2874
01:18:52.451 --> 01:18:54.160
<v Speaker 1>with societies and uh,</v>

2875
01:18:54.161 --> 01:18:59.161
<v Speaker 1>especially with like modern societies where there's like mass,</v>

2876
01:18:59.591 --> 01:19:00.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2877
01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.630
<v Speaker 1>speed communication.</v>

2878
01:19:01.631 --> 01:19:05.110
<v Speaker 1>It's like people are sending each other text messages and watching television,</v>

2879
01:19:05.111 --> 01:19:10.111
<v Speaker 1>all these is that we're missing out key information that is there in nature.</v>

2880
01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And that literally,</v>

2881
01:19:12.190 --> 01:19:13.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a natural state,</v>

2882
01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:18.640
<v Speaker 1>like if you're living in a natural state and you're away from the,</v>

2883
01:19:18.641 --> 01:19:18.941
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2884
01:19:18.941 --> 01:19:23.500
<v Speaker 1>the distractions and the madness of the fucking civilized world,</v>

2885
01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.680
<v Speaker 1>that there's literally a signal that you can't quite pick up anymore.</v>

2886
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:34.110
<v Speaker 1>And that signal is like a guide to get through life at like the earth literally</v>

2887
01:19:35.681 --> 01:19:36.610
<v Speaker 1>does talk to.</v>

2888
01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Is that the collective consciousness,</v>

2889
01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:38.620
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

2890
01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:39.101
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2891
01:19:39.101 --> 01:19:39.341
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2892
01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:42.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I believe that it ever really was the kid of the case that</v>

2893
01:19:42.311 --> 01:19:45.490
<v Speaker 1>people were much more sensitive to the language of the earth.</v>

2894
01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.810
<v Speaker 1>It is possible.</v>

2895
01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really hard to even wrap our heads around what it must've been like</v>

2896
01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:52.600
<v Speaker 1>before they were lying,</v>

2897
01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.910
<v Speaker 6>which I know all the toxins that we've,</v>

2898
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:56.080
<v Speaker 6>that we've produced as well.</v>

2899
01:19:56.110 --> 01:19:58.660
<v Speaker 6>All the things that we've been to introduce to our diet until our bodies,</v>

2900
01:19:59.290 --> 01:19:59.710
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2901
01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:01.870
<v Speaker 6>like the dashboard on my truck outside,</v>

2902
01:20:01.871 --> 01:20:02.890
<v Speaker 6>he's killing me slowly.</v>

2903
01:20:02.891 --> 01:20:03.311
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2904
01:20:03.311 --> 01:20:04.091
<v Speaker 6>That's the kind of stuff.</v>

2905
01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:04.301
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2906
01:20:04.301 --> 01:20:04.481
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

2907
01:20:04.481 --> 01:20:04.661
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2908
01:20:04.661 --> 01:20:05.410
<v Speaker 6>they had met them,</v>

2909
01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:07.630
<v Speaker 6>met all kinds of chemicals and you know,</v>

2910
01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2911
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:09.050
<v Speaker 4>like fluoride is,</v>

2912
01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:13.590
<v Speaker 4>as people are now starting to understand fluoride is bad for you.</v>

2913
01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Well how many is that?</v>

2914
01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:15.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2915
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:17.760
<v Speaker 4>Calcifies your pineal gland supposedly.</v>

2916
01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:19.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if there's ever been any real studies.</v>

2917
01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:22.380
<v Speaker 4>I have a feeling that might be something that someone just said once.</v>

2918
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 4>Everybody just repeats.</v>

2919
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:24.750
<v Speaker 4>I can take it out and I don't mind.</v>

2920
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:25.921
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2921
01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:26.460
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2922
01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:30.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't think there's necessarily a lot of evidence that it's good for you</v>

2923
01:20:30.630 --> 01:20:30.901
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

2924
01:20:30.901 --> 01:20:31.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2925
01:20:31.170 --> 01:20:34.800
<v Speaker 4>people say that there's a connection between putting fluoride in the water and</v>

2926
01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:36.030
<v Speaker 4>removing tooth decay.</v>

2927
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:40.800
<v Speaker 4>But that also coincided with education about brushing.</v>

2928
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.610
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2929
01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:42.030
<v Speaker 4>the other,</v>

2930
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:44.520
<v Speaker 4>that shit went down when people realize that you have to brush,</v>

2931
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2932
01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:47.130
<v Speaker 4>and then putting fluoride in your teeth,</v>

2933
01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:48.870
<v Speaker 4>brush in your toothpaste.</v>

2934
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.400
<v Speaker 4>Apparently that's not so good either.</v>

2935
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 4>Even though you don't eat it,</v>

2936
01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.391
<v Speaker 4>it's still,</v>

2937
01:20:52.391 --> 01:20:55.850
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's a reason why you don't swallow that stuff once you like.</v>

2938
01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:56.680
<v Speaker 4>She like,</v>

2939
01:20:56.680 --> 01:20:57.090
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2940
01:20:57.090 --> 01:20:58.490
<v Speaker 4>Famous in the foam it up in your mind.</v>

2941
01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.370
<v Speaker 4>Drinking water though.</v>

2942
01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:00.293
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2943
01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.350
<v Speaker 4>Fucking it's crazy.</v>

2944
01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2945
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:04.110
<v Speaker 4>but why do we still do it though?</v>

2946
01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:05.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2947
01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.180
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty awesome.</v>

2948
01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:10.560
<v Speaker 4>So I'm sure that some grants scheme that send me a tweet about and I'll spend</v>

2949
01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:12.090
<v Speaker 4>the next four hours festering over it.</v>

2950
01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:13.290
<v Speaker 4>What else?</v>

2951
01:21:13.290 --> 01:21:14.970
<v Speaker 4>I think these are things that are potentially like,</v>

2952
01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:15.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2953
01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:17.070
<v Speaker 4>like keeping as disconnected from,</v>

2954
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:19.920
<v Speaker 4>from this whatever we're missing out on this language that we're,</v>

2955
01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 4>that we're missing out on front of the,</v>

2956
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:23.160
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's possible,</v>

2957
01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:25.300
<v Speaker 4>but I think that if you were living in the jungle and you needed,</v>

2958
01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:26.453
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2959
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:29.310
<v Speaker 4>you needed to survive there and it is possible that you would eat,</v>

2960
01:21:29.311 --> 01:21:32.880
<v Speaker 4>least have an idea of mixing these two things together and cooking them.</v>

2961
01:21:33.090 --> 01:21:33.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2962
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:36.090
<v Speaker 4>but you imagine if you found out you were right,</v>

2963
01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.010
<v Speaker 4>like when you created Iowasca me,</v>

2964
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.690
<v Speaker 4>if the dude just nailed it the first time,</v>

2965
01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.190
<v Speaker 4>like let's see what we got here.</v>

2966
01:21:41.220 --> 01:21:41.910
<v Speaker 4>It takes a sip.</v>

2967
01:21:41.910 --> 01:21:42.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2968
01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:42.761
<v Speaker 4>Do,</v>

2969
01:21:42.761 --> 01:21:42.971
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2970
01:21:42.971 --> 01:21:43.201
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2971
01:21:43.201 --> 01:21:44.034
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2972
01:21:44.670 --> 01:21:45.421
<v Speaker 4>do doom,</v>

2973
01:21:45.421 --> 01:21:45.871
<v Speaker 4>doom,</v>

2974
01:21:45.871 --> 01:21:46.590
<v Speaker 4>doom.</v>

2975
01:21:46.590 --> 01:21:47.460
<v Speaker 4>He must've been like,</v>

2976
01:21:47.461 --> 01:21:48.031
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

2977
01:21:48.031 --> 01:21:49.110
<v Speaker 4>did I knock it out of the park?</v>

2978
01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.700
<v Speaker 4>Well the fuck your vegetable soup.</v>

2979
01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:51.600
<v Speaker 4>I got some shit.</v>

2980
01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:54.630
<v Speaker 4>It will kick your Dick right into the dirt sign.</v>

2981
01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.510
<v Speaker 4>But look at the guy that found that the discovered LSD.</v>

2982
01:21:57.900 --> 01:21:58.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2983
01:21:58.111 --> 01:21:58.680
<v Speaker 4>Albert Hoffman.</v>

2984
01:21:58.680 --> 01:21:59.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2985
01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.540
<v Speaker 4>Like completely complete accident.</v>

2986
01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:03.430
<v Speaker 4>And not only that and he like rode home and thought he was going mad</v>

2987
01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:06.613
<v Speaker 4>bicycle.</v>

2988
01:22:07.020 --> 01:22:08.210
<v Speaker 4>First LSD trip ever.</v>

2989
01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:13.290
<v Speaker 4>And then didn't you go back a couple of days later and said like it like five</v>

2990
01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:14.670
<v Speaker 4>times the amount or something?</v>

2991
01:22:14.730 --> 01:22:15.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2992
01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.080
<v Speaker 4>I think the initial amount he took was way higher than like a normal dose.</v>

2993
01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:22.650
<v Speaker 4>It's like a bucket.</v>

2994
01:22:22.650 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 4>I think it came in through his fingers I think because,</v>

2995
01:22:26.851 --> 01:22:27.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2996
01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:28.280
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing about acid,</v>

2997
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:29.940
<v Speaker 4>it'll go right through your skin.</v>

2998
01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2999
01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:31.820
<v Speaker 4>Had that happened.</v>

3000
01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:34.980
<v Speaker 4>That's exciting for the first time,</v>

3001
01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:39.600
<v Speaker 4>the first dude to figure out Iowasca how long ago was that?</v>

3002
01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:42.330
<v Speaker 4>They'd say it's at least 2000 years.</v>

3003
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:43.251
<v Speaker 4>They say they've,</v>

3004
01:22:43.251 --> 01:22:43.650
<v Speaker 4>they've,</v>

3005
01:22:43.650 --> 01:22:48.650
<v Speaker 4>they've shown like archeological evidence of Iowasca use up to 2000 years ago.</v>

3006
01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:49.770
<v Speaker 4>How do you even,</v>

3007
01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:50.190
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3008
01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:51.870
<v Speaker 4>I can't make sense of it now and I have,</v>

3009
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:52.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3010
01:22:52.340 --> 01:22:52.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3011
01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.333
<v Speaker 4>much more,</v>

3012
01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:53.751
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3013
01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:56.210
<v Speaker 4>a much better understanding of the universe and you know,</v>

3014
01:22:56.220 --> 01:22:56.570
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

3015
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:58.080
<v Speaker 4>as obviously it's science knows it,</v>

3016
01:22:58.081 --> 01:23:00.920
<v Speaker 4>but like back then when all you know is,</v>

3017
01:23:00.970 --> 01:23:05.970
<v Speaker 4>is the jungle and the plants around you and how would you even begin</v>

3018
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:06.900
<v Speaker 6>to make sense of that?</v>

3019
01:23:06.930 --> 01:23:08.670
<v Speaker 6>How would you begin to make sense of that?</v>

3020
01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:09.271
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3021
01:23:09.271 --> 01:23:10.104
<v Speaker 6>How would you,</v>

3022
01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.850
<v Speaker 6>and then how do you become an expert,</v>

3023
01:23:11.910 --> 01:23:12.240
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3024
01:23:12.240 --> 01:23:13.440
<v Speaker 6>introducing that to other people,</v>

3025
01:23:13.441 --> 01:23:14.274
<v Speaker 6>like a shaman,</v>

3026
01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:15.720
<v Speaker 6>which I find really fascinating.</v>

3027
01:23:15.721 --> 01:23:16.710
<v Speaker 6>The idea of shamanism.</v>

3028
01:23:17.210 --> 01:23:18.290
<v Speaker 1>It's very fascinating.</v>

3029
01:23:18.300 --> 01:23:21.050
<v Speaker 1>You know why it's fascinating because you've experienced it and you know,</v>

3030
01:23:21.051 --> 01:23:23.540
<v Speaker 1>it's real to a joke.</v>

3031
01:23:23.541 --> 01:23:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Construction worker lunchbox that's listening to this nonsense right now.</v>

3032
01:23:26.930 --> 01:23:27.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3033
01:23:27.171 --> 01:23:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I like that Joe Rogan podcasts,</v>

3034
01:23:28.801 --> 01:23:32.860
<v Speaker 1>but every now and then they go off the fucking tin foil hat deepened.</v>

3035
01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:36.860
<v Speaker 1>And this guy's talking about journey into the spirit world that I want to be a</v>

3036
01:23:36.861 --> 01:23:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Shama and get the fuck outta here.</v>

3037
01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Tell me a joke.</v>

3038
01:23:40.431 --> 01:23:41.241
<v Speaker 1>Ass face.</v>

3039
01:23:41.241 --> 01:23:41.601
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3040
01:23:41.601 --> 01:23:42.381
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're here for.</v>

3041
01:23:42.381 --> 01:23:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Your fuck.</v>

3042
01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:44.750
<v Speaker 1>That guy is a black belt under Matt Serra.</v>

3043
01:23:48.170 --> 01:23:49.003
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>

3044
01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:49.911
<v Speaker 1>Possibly.</v>

3045
01:23:49.911 --> 01:23:50.744
<v Speaker 1>Well done.</v>

3046
01:23:51.230 --> 01:23:51.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3047
01:23:51.621 --> 01:23:51.950
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3048
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:52.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3049
01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:53.081
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3050
01:23:53.081 --> 01:23:53.181
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3051
01:23:53.181 --> 01:23:53.661
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3052
01:23:53.661 --> 01:23:55.070
<v Speaker 1>it's real that you've done it,</v>

3053
01:23:55.071 --> 01:23:56.180
<v Speaker 1>you've experienced it and it's,</v>

3054
01:23:56.190 --> 01:23:57.440
<v Speaker 1>it's not just real,</v>

3055
01:23:57.770 --> 01:24:01.310
<v Speaker 1>it's real in a way where you feel sorry for people who haven't</v>

3056
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:02.670
<v Speaker 6>great first it because if,</v>

3057
01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:02.970
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

3058
01:24:02.970 --> 01:24:03.803
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time I,</v>

3059
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.290
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3060
01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:04.650
<v Speaker 6>when I,</v>

3061
01:24:04.650 --> 01:24:06.930
<v Speaker 6>when I first came back from Peru and people were asking me,</v>

3062
01:24:06.931 --> 01:24:07.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3063
01:24:07.470 --> 01:24:09.110
<v Speaker 6>is this something that everyone should experience?</v>

3064
01:24:09.111 --> 01:24:12.120
<v Speaker 6>I was saying yes to everybody but now I'm not so sure.</v>

3065
01:24:12.450 --> 01:24:15.420
<v Speaker 6>I think there are like I was walking through the looks side of the day and you</v>

3066
01:24:15.421 --> 01:24:16.254
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

3067
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:19.770
<v Speaker 6>God bless America and all the people that were pumping money into those slots</v>

3068
01:24:19.771 --> 01:24:21.810
<v Speaker 6>and smoking cigarettes and drinking beers,</v>

3069
01:24:21.811 --> 01:24:23.850
<v Speaker 6>but they need a lot of,</v>

3070
01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.840
<v Speaker 6>they need to a lot of self discovery without an altered state before there would</v>

3071
01:24:26.841 --> 01:24:27.720
<v Speaker 6>be even ready for that.</v>

3072
01:24:27.721 --> 01:24:29.460
<v Speaker 6>Like if you took them and gave him my Alaska,</v>

3073
01:24:29.461 --> 01:24:31.050
<v Speaker 6>it would ruin them forever.</v>

3074
01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:32.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>

3075
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe this,</v>

3076
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:33.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3077
01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.490
<v Speaker 1>maybe just seeing them at their worst.</v>

3078
01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they would say that about you if they caught you beaten off.</v>

3079
01:24:37.710 --> 01:24:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe you know,</v>

3080
01:24:38.781 --> 01:24:42.840
<v Speaker 1>you're there and your I's cross your tongue out and like,</v>

3081
01:24:42.841 --> 01:24:43.021
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3082
01:24:43.021 --> 01:24:44.250
<v Speaker 1>this guy really needs a fucking,</v>

3083
01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I lost this seminar.</v>

3084
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.220
<v Speaker 1>You need to get your own life together,</v>

3085
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.640
<v Speaker 1>son.</v>

3086
01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.473
<v Speaker 6>Yeah they would,</v>

3087
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.620
<v Speaker 6>they would come down on you.</v>

3088
01:24:49.860 --> 01:24:50.521
<v Speaker 6>But it's Kinda,</v>

3089
01:24:50.521 --> 01:24:53.590
<v Speaker 6>it's Kinda weird because like the people that find their way to it a light</v>

3090
01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.030
<v Speaker 6>already in a place in their life where they're kind of prepared for it,</v>

3091
01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.193
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3092
01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.430
<v Speaker 1>that that happens a lot of the time.</v>

3093
01:25:00.431 --> 01:25:03.310
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not completely convinced that happens all the time.</v>

3094
01:25:03.311 --> 01:25:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely heard of people having bad experiences or going there when they</v>

3095
01:25:06.821 --> 01:25:07.631
<v Speaker 1>weren't ready for it.</v>

3096
01:25:07.631 --> 01:25:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3097
01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I think psychedelic experiences are incredibly powerful.</v>

3098
01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:16.620
<v Speaker 1>And to say that people should or shouldn't do it is equally foolish because to</v>

3099
01:25:16.691 --> 01:25:18.250
<v Speaker 1>say that someone should do it,</v>

3100
01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:18.581
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3101
01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:20.410
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck do you know that guy should do at what?</v>

3102
01:25:20.411 --> 01:25:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause you did it and you like it.</v>

3103
01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3104
01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:24.350
<v Speaker 6>I agree with that.</v>

3105
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:25.050
<v Speaker 6>I just think,</v>

3106
01:25:25.050 --> 01:25:25.883
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3107
01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:27.771
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

3108
01:25:27.771 --> 01:25:30.410
<v Speaker 6>it's a lot to process for someone that's open minded.</v>

3109
01:25:30.411 --> 01:25:30.680
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3110
01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:34.460
<v Speaker 6>So for someone that is buying into the Oprah call and you know,</v>

3111
01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:35.691
<v Speaker 6>hope it's bad ass,</v>

3112
01:25:35.691 --> 01:25:35.931
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

3113
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:36.710
<v Speaker 6>don't get me wrong,</v>

3114
01:25:36.710 --> 01:25:37.580
<v Speaker 6>don't get it twisted.</v>

3115
01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:40.340
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] I'd like to take over to Peru.</v>

3116
01:25:40.770 --> 01:25:44.360
<v Speaker 6>We need to do we need to get Oprah and bring her to the jungle?</v>

3117
01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:44.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3118
01:25:44.900 --> 01:25:45.950
<v Speaker 6>I think this is the way forward.</v>

3119
01:25:45.951 --> 01:25:48.590
<v Speaker 6>I think this is how we move to the next stage of our evolution is we've got to</v>

3120
01:25:48.591 --> 01:25:49.490
<v Speaker 6>start getting some of these,</v>

3121
01:25:49.730 --> 01:25:53.120
<v Speaker 6>these power people and taking them out there and I think it's really happening.</v>

3122
01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:55.190
<v Speaker 6>We haven't heard about it at all yet.</v>

3123
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:56.040
<v Speaker 6>I hope so.</v>

3124
01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

3125
01:25:56.490 --> 01:25:57.060
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

3126
01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:59.850
<v Speaker 1>if there really are people and they really are,</v>

3127
01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:03.000
<v Speaker 1>that really do have a massive amount of power in this world and they really do</v>

3128
01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:03.740
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

3129
01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that they've wanted to look into that.</v>

3130
01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you not want to look in that?</v>

3131
01:26:08.271 --> 01:26:09.800
<v Speaker 1>If there's anything that can freak you out.</v>

3132
01:26:09.801 --> 01:26:11.120
<v Speaker 1>If you were in the build the Berger Group,</v>

3133
01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.240
<v Speaker 1>you mother fuckers sitting around and do it.</v>

3134
01:26:14.241 --> 01:26:19.241
<v Speaker 1>Iowasca talking to the the great serpent as it breaks down your life and the</v>

3135
01:26:19.281 --> 01:26:23.210
<v Speaker 1>kind of damage that you're doing to society and civilization and how unnecessary</v>

3136
01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:24.650
<v Speaker 1>it is and how you're still unhappy,</v>

3137
01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:25.880
<v Speaker 1>even though you're doing it,</v>

3138
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.040
<v Speaker 1>even though you're manipulating the banks,</v>

3139
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 1>controlling the resources of the world,</v>

3140
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:35.150
<v Speaker 1>instigating wars overseas and profiting off of it and some strange fucking shell</v>

3141
01:26:35.151 --> 01:26:36.800
<v Speaker 1>game that nobody completely understands.</v>

3142
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:38.450
<v Speaker 1>You're still not happy bitch.</v>

3143
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:39.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's what it would tell you.</v>

3144
01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:41.900
<v Speaker 1>It would be good for everybody.</v>

3145
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.561
<v Speaker 1>But what'd you think?</v>

3146
01:26:42.561 --> 01:26:42.981

<v Speaker 1>you really would.</v>

3223
01:29:08.530 --> 01:29:09.420
<v Speaker 1>And even people,</v>

3224
01:29:09.450 --> 01:29:10.980
<v Speaker 1>even people who have experienced it,</v>

3225
01:29:11.010 --> 01:29:13.650
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to describe it that way cause you don't want to sound stupid to</v>

3226
01:29:13.651 --> 01:29:14.910
<v Speaker 1>people haven't experienced it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>your cerebral cortex gets flooded with chemicals.</v>

3232
01:29:20.491 --> 01:29:23.220
<v Speaker 1>You're the visual aspect of your interpretation of the world around you.</v>

3233
01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:23.461

<v Speaker 1>or maybe you haven't done it yet.</v>

3241
01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:34.200
<v Speaker 1>And if you have done it,</v>

3242
01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:35.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe just cynical.</v>

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you're missing out on what the fuck that is.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's the whole,</v>

3288
01:30:47.130 --> 01:30:47.520
<v Speaker 6>the whole,</v>

3289
01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.070
<v Speaker 6>my whole perspective of life changed though.</v>

3290
01:30:49.071 --> 01:30:49.190
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3291
01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:51.450
<v Speaker 6>I quite liked the temporariness of it now.</v>

3292
01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:52.471
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3293
01:30:52.471 --> 01:30:52.860
<v Speaker 6>Because,</v>

3294
01:30:52.860 --> 01:30:55.140
<v Speaker 6>because this is the space that I always experienced,</v>

3295
01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:56.160
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3296
01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:57.900
<v Speaker 6>with the Ios Ska and you know,</v>

3297
01:30:58.830 --> 01:31:02.250
<v Speaker 6>other psychedelic like DMT or psilocybin.</v>

3298
01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.510
<v Speaker 6>I always feel like,</v>

3299
01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:04.741
<v Speaker 6>like the place,</v>

3300
01:31:04.741 --> 01:31:07.860
<v Speaker 6>our reach when I've had the right kind of amount is,</v>

3301
01:31:07.950 --> 01:31:08.940
<v Speaker 6>is a very familiar,</v>

3302
01:31:08.941 --> 01:31:09.774
<v Speaker 6>safe place.</v>

3303
01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:12.270
<v Speaker 6>I've been there hundreds of times before.</v>

3304
01:31:12.271 --> 01:31:12.570
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

3305
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:12.811
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3306
01:31:12.811 --> 01:31:13.321
<v Speaker 6>I'm back.</v>

3307
01:31:13.321 --> 01:31:13.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3308
01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:15.840
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that the weirdest thing about it is really odd.</v>

3309
01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:18.900
<v Speaker 1>The weirdest thing about it is how it feels so comfortable and so,</v>

3310
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:20.400
<v Speaker 1>so normal.</v>

3311
01:31:20.401 --> 01:31:21.990
<v Speaker 1>It feels so familiar.</v>

3312
01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:22.560
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3313
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:22.890
<v Speaker 6>I think,</v>

3314
01:31:22.890 --> 01:31:24.400
<v Speaker 6>I think woman described it in the,</v>

3315
01:31:24.401 --> 01:31:24.901
<v Speaker 6>the DMT,</v>

3316
01:31:24.901 --> 01:31:27.360
<v Speaker 6>but the spirit molecule book a doctor Rick Strassman,</v>

3317
01:31:27.390 --> 01:31:28.000
<v Speaker 6>she said,</v>

3318
01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:28.440
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3319
01:31:28.440 --> 01:31:31.260
<v Speaker 6>it feels like a waiting room between death and birth,</v>

3320
01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:33.960
<v Speaker 6>which I thought was kind of an interesting perspective.</v>

3321
01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:34.620
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

3322
01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.340
<v Speaker 6>I remember my knees,</v>

3323
01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:37.800
<v Speaker 6>my latest psychedelic trip that it was like,</v>

3324
01:31:37.801 --> 01:31:38.790
<v Speaker 6>just like that where I'm like,</v>

3325
01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:39.870
<v Speaker 6>I've been here before,</v>

3326
01:31:39.871 --> 01:31:41.070
<v Speaker 6>why can't I remember this?</v>

3327
01:31:41.370 --> 01:31:41.611
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3328
01:31:41.611 --> 01:31:43.200
<v Speaker 6>it seems like I do that a lot,</v>

3329
01:31:43.201 --> 01:31:45.330
<v Speaker 6>like go to the same place so many times.</v>

3330
01:31:45.570 --> 01:31:46.051
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3331
01:31:46.051 --> 01:31:46.680
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3332
01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.760
<v Speaker 6>what would be a part of your brain,</v>

3333
01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:48.020
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

3334
01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:48.650
<v Speaker 1>It could,</v>

3335
01:31:48.650 --> 01:31:49.030
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3336
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:52.370
<v Speaker 1>it's so close to normal human neuro chemistry.</v>

3337
01:31:52.371 --> 01:31:53.720
<v Speaker 1>The most profound ones,</v>

3338
01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:54.470
<v Speaker 1>they're all,</v>

3339
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:58.550
<v Speaker 1>they're so close to normal shit you bring produces like mushrooms,</v>

3340
01:31:58.930 --> 01:32:02.420
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms and DMT or like very closely combined are very closely related to</v>

3341
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:04.900
<v Speaker 1>chemicals and DMT is produced by your brain.</v>

3342
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 1>So all of those experiences are just,</v>

3343
01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:11.860
<v Speaker 1>they know exactly where to hit in your mind to produce this stuff.</v>

3344
01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Can't think that that's a coincidence.</v>

3345
01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I can't think that that's all an accident.</v>

3346
01:32:16.090 --> 01:32:16.570
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3347
01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:16.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3348
01:32:16.730 --> 01:32:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I like,</v>

3349
01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I like Terence Mckenna's theory on,</v>

3350
01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:19.871
<v Speaker 1>on the introduction,</v>

3351
01:32:19.871 --> 01:32:21.790
<v Speaker 1>this other side of it into the human diet.</v>

3352
01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3353
01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.113
<v Speaker 1>When we became,</v>

3354
01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:23.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3355
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3356
01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:28.040
<v Speaker 1>from the canopy dwelling fruity taste to the plain dwelling kind of forages.</v>

3357
01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:28.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3358
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that holds up scientifically as far as the timeline,</v>

3359
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.131
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

3360
01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard anyone say anything more plausible.</v>

3361
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3362
01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:39.760
<v Speaker 1>there's no real serious explanation.</v>

3363
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge leap in consciousness,</v>

3364
01:32:41.831 --> 01:32:43.570
<v Speaker 1>a doubling of the human brain size.</v>

3365
01:32:43.571 --> 01:32:47.500
<v Speaker 1>We were a period of 2 million years and apparently that's the greatest mystery</v>

3366
01:32:47.501 --> 01:32:49.030
<v Speaker 1>in the entire fossil record.</v>

3367
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I've always wanted to,</v>

3368
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:53.710
<v Speaker 1>to have a real light dose of mushrooms and fight like a grandma or grandma and a</v>

3369
01:32:53.711 --> 01:32:55.690
<v Speaker 1>half and fight and fight.</v>

3370
01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3371
01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:56.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3372
01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:56.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3373
01:32:56.831 --> 01:32:57.071
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3374
01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>I know people who've played pool with it and they say they can't miss.</v>

3375
01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:02.050
<v Speaker 1>They say they know where the ball is at all times.</v>

3376
01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:04.720
<v Speaker 1>They feel it moving on the table in three dimensional space.</v>

3377
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3378
01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:05.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3379
01:33:05.471 --> 01:33:09.640
<v Speaker 1>Guys used to play pool on a small amounts of acid too and like have the best</v>

3380
01:33:09.641 --> 01:33:10.474
<v Speaker 1>game of their life.</v>

3381
01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:11.321
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3382
01:33:11.321 --> 01:33:12.910
<v Speaker 1>what a waste waste of LSD.</v>

3383
01:33:13.770 --> 01:33:14.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3384
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd want to be doing something creative,</v>

3385
01:33:16.961 --> 01:33:18.640
<v Speaker 1>but if you were a series pool player,</v>

3386
01:33:18.850 --> 01:33:21.760
<v Speaker 1>like that's apparently the way to get really awesome series pool.</v>

3387
01:33:21.780 --> 01:33:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Plenty.</v>

3388
01:33:22.300 --> 01:33:23.200
<v Speaker 1>I played a lot pool.</v>

3389
01:33:23.290 --> 01:33:23.501
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3390
01:33:23.501 --> 01:33:24.334
<v Speaker 1>For Real.</v>

3391
01:33:24.370 --> 01:33:27.130
<v Speaker 1>But he's not as a job though.</v>

3392
01:33:27.131 --> 01:33:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't do it like I would play professionally.</v>

3393
01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Showback golf though.</v>

3394
01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:31.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3395
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.241
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3396
01:33:31.241 --> 01:33:31.690
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3397
01:33:31.690 --> 01:33:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Golf is first of all golf.</v>

3398
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:34.780
<v Speaker 1>You're out there walking around in the rain.</v>

3399
01:33:34.810 --> 01:33:35.643
<v Speaker 1>That's retarded.</v>

3400
01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:36.060
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3401
01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:36.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3402
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:36.821
<v Speaker 1>second of all,</v>

3403
01:33:36.821 --> 01:33:38.590
<v Speaker 1>he chasing a ball around pool.</v>

3404
01:33:38.591 --> 01:33:42.400
<v Speaker 1>It's all on this one table that the environment is exactly the same every time.</v>

3405
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.620
<v Speaker 1>You're not dealing with holes and roles.</v>

3406
01:33:44.621 --> 01:33:46.630
<v Speaker 1>And I bet I would love golf,</v>

3407
01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:50.140
<v Speaker 1>but I'm terrified of trying it and finding out that I love and predictable.</v>

3408
01:33:50.170 --> 01:33:51.070
<v Speaker 1>So much work.</v>

3409
01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:54.970
<v Speaker 1>You're out there eight hours a day chasing a fucking ball and when you play 18</v>

3410
01:33:54.971 --> 01:33:55.301
<v Speaker 1>holes,</v>

3411
01:33:55.301 --> 01:33:57.010
<v Speaker 1>like that's several hours worth of playing,</v>

3412
01:33:57.640 --> 01:33:58.790
<v Speaker 1>drinking that Joe that's,</v>

3413
01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:00.410
<v Speaker 1>did you enjoy it more with LSD?</v>

3414
01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Bill Murray didn't Cag shot it wasn't that as thing wasn't it taken acid and</v>

3415
01:34:07.271 --> 01:34:08.104
<v Speaker 1>play golf?</v>

3416
01:34:08.710 --> 01:34:09.311
<v Speaker 1>It's been so long.</v>

3417
01:34:09.311 --> 01:34:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I know that people have done it.</v>

3418
01:34:10.630 --> 01:34:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3419
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:13.840
<v Speaker 1>It gives you more sensitivity apparently.</v>

3420
01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.910
<v Speaker 1>More spacial recognition,</v>

3421
01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:16.750
<v Speaker 1>more uh,</v>

3422
01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:18.460
<v Speaker 1>understanding of distance deception.</v>

3423
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:18.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3424
01:34:18.851 --> 01:34:22.600
<v Speaker 1>And the depth perception and apparently in a way that really you'd never,</v>

3425
01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:24.220
<v Speaker 1>you never see this field.</v>

3426
01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Medical scientists and Silva's secrets every time.</v>

3427
01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:28.193
<v Speaker 1>Fights.</v>

3428
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:30.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3429
01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if he,</v>

3430
01:34:31.450 --> 01:34:31.721
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3431
01:34:31.721 --> 01:34:32.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3432
01:34:32.171 --> 01:34:32.711
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>

3433
01:34:32.711 --> 01:34:34.690
<v Speaker 1>but you tested positive for mushrooms.</v>

3434
01:34:34.691 --> 01:34:35.770
<v Speaker 1>You fuck like Jesus.</v>

3435
01:34:35.771 --> 01:34:36.604
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

3436
01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Fighting how much it should be a separate belt for that entirely.</v>

3437
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:39.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3438
01:34:39.641 --> 01:34:41.090
<v Speaker 1>there was a baseball player,</v>

3439
01:34:41.091 --> 01:34:44.530
<v Speaker 1>a famous baseball player who pitched a no hitter while I was on acid.</v>

3440
01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3441
01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Who was that?</v>

3442
01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:46.833
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what it is?</v>

3443
01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:47.943
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

3444
01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:49.653
<v Speaker 1>I'll pull it up.</v>

3445
01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:50.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3446
01:34:50.540 --> 01:34:51.430
<v Speaker 1>hit her on acid.</v>

3447
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.250
<v Speaker 1>It was not during the seven days and uh,</v>

3448
01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:58.430
<v Speaker 1>apparently what happened was he wasn't supposed be pitching dock Ellis.</v>

3449
01:34:58.760 --> 01:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't supposed to be pitching that day.</v>

3450
01:35:00.531 --> 01:35:01.820
<v Speaker 1>So he's decided to get lit up,</v>

3451
01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:04.740
<v Speaker 1>take some acid and then like something happened.</v>

3452
01:35:04.770 --> 01:35:08.810
<v Speaker 1>They called him in and he had to go play and he said he was just fine.</v>

3453
01:35:08.811 --> 01:35:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Heinie pitch a no hitter.</v>

3454
01:35:11.810 --> 01:35:11.991
<v Speaker 6>See,</v>

3455
01:35:11.991 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 6>I'd love to have lived through those days of sport instead of these.</v>

3456
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:15.650
<v Speaker 6>Now these are two regulators,</v>

3457
01:35:15.651 --> 01:35:16.190
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3458
01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:16.491
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3459
01:35:16.491 --> 01:35:17.420
<v Speaker 6>Let's go back to those,</v>

3460
01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.790
<v Speaker 6>the those like 1960s and seventies.</v>

3461
01:35:20.140 --> 01:35:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Those were crazy days.</v>

3462
01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.660
<v Speaker 1>But you can't go back.</v>

3463
01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:23.140
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3464
01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:27.130
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be looking back at this day thinking how crazy we were as well.</v>

3465
01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:29.200
<v Speaker 6>I often think of all the things that are going to,</v>

3466
01:35:29.230 --> 01:35:30.670
<v Speaker 6>we're going to look back on even when I'm,</v>

3467
01:35:30.671 --> 01:35:31.840
<v Speaker 6>or when I'm going to look back and be like,</v>

3468
01:35:31.841 --> 01:35:32.081
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

3469
01:35:32.081 --> 01:35:32.914
<v Speaker 6>we actually did that.</v>

3470
01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:33.340
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3471
01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:35.530
<v Speaker 6>like I remember I smoked like people smoking on planes.</v>

3472
01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:36.161
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

3473
01:35:36.161 --> 01:35:36.760
<v Speaker 6>I remember that.</v>

3474
01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:37.320
<v Speaker 6>That's crazy.</v>

3475
01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:37.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3476
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.333
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

3477
01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:41.950
<v Speaker 6>Like even like I live in Vegas now,</v>

3478
01:35:41.951 --> 01:35:43.000
<v Speaker 6>walk into the casino and I'm like,</v>

3479
01:35:43.030 --> 01:35:43.420
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3480
01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:44.440
<v Speaker 6>there's smoke everywhere.</v>

3481
01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:47.620
<v Speaker 6>It's like two years ago that people stop smoking in the UK.</v>

3482
01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:48.491
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3483
01:35:48.491 --> 01:35:50.830
<v Speaker 6>Well I've immediately made the adjustment though.</v>

3484
01:35:50.831 --> 01:35:51.461
<v Speaker 6>So like in,</v>

3485
01:35:51.461 --> 01:35:53.200
<v Speaker 6>in like 30 or 40 years time,</v>

3486
01:35:53.201 --> 01:35:55.060
<v Speaker 6>like when I'm on a plane and we're like,</v>

3487
01:35:55.061 --> 01:35:55.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3488
01:35:55.780 --> 01:35:57.370
<v Speaker 6>I can't even imagine what it would be like,</v>

3489
01:35:57.371 --> 01:35:59.920
<v Speaker 6>but we're going to look back at sort of like Delta and be like,</v>

3490
01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.593
<v Speaker 6>hell no.</v>

3491
01:36:01.630 --> 01:36:02.830
<v Speaker 6>I can't believe I ever did that.</v>

3492
01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:04.450
<v Speaker 6>I lost my bags.</v>

3493
01:36:04.950 --> 01:36:05.230
<v Speaker 6>I was,</v>

3494
01:36:05.230 --> 01:36:07.450
<v Speaker 6>I was stuck between two fat guys sweating on me,</v>

3495
01:36:07.451 --> 01:36:07.840
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3496
01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3497
01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.150
<v Speaker 1>The definitely,</v>

3498
01:36:09.151 --> 01:36:09.391
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3499
01:36:09.391 --> 01:36:10.610
<v Speaker 1>With this kind of be one day.</v>

3500
01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's going to be a better version of that,</v>

3501
01:36:12.780 --> 01:36:13.171
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

3502
01:36:13.171 --> 01:36:15.420
<v Speaker 1>the smoking and the sky's the most ridiculous one.</v>

3503
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Or when you like nurses and dentists could like smoke while they're actually</v>

3504
01:36:21.060 --> 01:36:21.861
<v Speaker 1>working on your team.</v>

3505
01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Fifties movies and shit.</v>

3506
01:36:23.491 --> 01:36:24.324
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3507
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3508
01:36:24.630 --> 01:36:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Everyone smoked.</v>

3509
01:36:25.471 --> 01:36:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I was watching the invasion of the body snatchers seal the day,</v>

3510
01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.100
<v Speaker 1>the old version,</v>

3511
01:36:29.310 --> 01:36:32.670
<v Speaker 1>fucking doctors sitting there lighten up in the middle of a doctor's</v>

3512
01:36:32.671 --> 01:36:33.470
<v Speaker 1>appointment.</v>

3513
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:35.760
<v Speaker 1>You're definitely talking too much about cigarettes today.</v>

3514
01:36:35.770 --> 01:36:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm the freaking out junkie.</v>

3515
01:36:39.330 --> 01:36:40.163
<v Speaker 1>He's hooked.</v>

3516
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:41.101
<v Speaker 1>But yeah.</v>

3517
01:36:41.101 --> 01:36:41.461
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

3518
01:36:41.461 --> 01:36:42.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3519
01:36:42.090 --> 01:36:43.290
<v Speaker 1>do you think that,</v>

3520
01:36:44.130 --> 01:36:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3521
01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:45.930
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like a crazy thing to say,</v>

3522
01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:48.910
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that I'm open to the future?</v>

3523
01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:49.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you are.</v>

3524
01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:53.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the future of the world,</v>

3525
01:36:53.550 --> 01:36:54.390
<v Speaker 1>like I</v>

3526
01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:00.600
<v Speaker 1>do think that it really depends on how many people have psychedelic experiences</v>

3527
01:37:01.020 --> 01:37:02.490
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

3528
01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 1>We need to tip the numbers in that direction in order for it to get,</v>

3529
01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:08.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3530
01:37:08.650 --> 01:37:09.060
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>

3531
01:37:09.060 --> 01:37:13.890
<v Speaker 1>a large percentage of people that are at least willing to question the way the</v>

3532
01:37:13.891 --> 01:37:14.970
<v Speaker 1>whole thing is built,</v>

3533
01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:18.300
<v Speaker 1>at least willing to question the way they're living their own lives,</v>

3534
01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:21.180
<v Speaker 1>at least willing to question what it is we're doing here.</v>

3535
01:37:21.330 --> 01:37:22.610
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing exactly?</v>

3536
01:37:22.890 --> 01:37:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Moving on momentum every day.</v>

3537
01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Getting up when your alarm clock goes off,</v>

3538
01:37:26.761 --> 01:37:27.660
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are we doing?</v>

3539
01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:28.840
<v Speaker 6>But we were running on,</v>

3540
01:37:29.090 --> 01:37:30.460
<v Speaker 6>like Terence Mckenna would say,</v>

3541
01:37:30.461 --> 01:37:32.490
<v Speaker 6>an operating system and the one that we're in nones,</v>

3542
01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:33.161
<v Speaker 6>prehistoric,</v>

3543
01:37:33.161 --> 01:37:33.341
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3544
01:37:33.341 --> 01:37:34.780
<v Speaker 6>everyone's trying to control each other.</v>

3545
01:37:34.990 --> 01:37:36.910
<v Speaker 6>Everyone's jealous of what everybody else has gotten.</v>

3546
01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.440
<v Speaker 6>We really need to get past that.</v>

3547
01:37:38.441 --> 01:37:40.030
<v Speaker 6>Realize that I don't need to be jealous.</v>

3548
01:37:40.031 --> 01:37:41.420
<v Speaker 6>So what anyone else has got because I'm,</v>

3549
01:37:41.530 --> 01:37:42.550
<v Speaker 6>I'm good with what I've got,</v>

3550
01:37:42.551 --> 01:37:42.761
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3551
01:37:42.761 --> 01:37:44.920
<v Speaker 6>and just kind of,</v>

3552
01:37:45.370 --> 01:37:45.800
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

3553
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:47.230
<v Speaker 6>people are not finding peace,</v>

3554
01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:49.840
<v Speaker 6>so they're surround himself with things that they think make them happy.</v>

3555
01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:52.920
<v Speaker 1>We haven't been aware for very long.</v>

3556
01:37:52.921 --> 01:37:53.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3557
01:37:53.110 --> 01:37:54.460
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a real problem.</v>

3558
01:37:54.490 --> 01:37:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that human race is in the middle of waking up and trying to figure out</v>

3559
01:37:59.201 --> 01:38:03.250
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck it did to get here and what it can do moving forward.</v>

3560
01:38:03.251 --> 01:38:06.310
<v Speaker 1>And right now we're still operating on what it did to get here.</v>

3561
01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:10.840
<v Speaker 1>We're still operating on the ripples of the affects of everything that's gone on</v>

3562
01:38:10.841 --> 01:38:11.674
<v Speaker 1>in the past.</v>

3563
01:38:12.250 --> 01:38:13.690
<v Speaker 1>And so when you say something like that,</v>

3564
01:38:13.691 --> 01:38:14.111
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>

3565
01:38:14.111 --> 01:38:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean people need to do psychedelics.</v>

3566
01:38:16.150 --> 01:38:18.040
<v Speaker 1>They just immediately dismiss you.</v>

3567
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Like you're all all this crazy fuck like listening to him.</v>

3568
01:38:21.161 --> 01:38:21.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3569
01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:22.840
<v Speaker 1>People need to do drugs.</v>

3570
01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:23.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3571
01:38:23.141 --> 01:38:23.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what they need to do.</v>

3572
01:38:23.981 --> 01:38:25.240
<v Speaker 1>Dan Hardee they needed,</v>

3573
01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:26.570
<v Speaker 6>but the thing,</v>

3574
01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:27.590
<v Speaker 6>the thing is I don't think,</v>

3575
01:38:27.650 --> 01:38:30.290
<v Speaker 6>I don't think the focus should be what it has to be psychedelics.</v>

3576
01:38:30.710 --> 01:38:31.170
<v Speaker 6>It's just,</v>

3577
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:33.170
<v Speaker 6>it's just about people becoming more conscious,</v>

3578
01:38:33.171 --> 01:38:35.090
<v Speaker 6>making conscious decisions and you know,</v>

3579
01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:38.330
<v Speaker 6>even when it comes to light diet and an exercise practice and,</v>

3580
01:38:38.331 --> 01:38:39.164
<v Speaker 6>and uh,</v>

3581
01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:39.651
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3582
01:38:39.651 --> 01:38:39.901
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

3583
01:38:39.901 --> 01:38:43.240
<v Speaker 6>just your approach to people into relationships to how you would,</v>

3584
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:44.360
<v Speaker 6>you deal with people,</v>

3585
01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:47.210
<v Speaker 6>your impact on the world and you know,</v>

3586
01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.300
<v Speaker 6>and as soon as more people start thinking about that,</v>

3587
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:50.540
<v Speaker 6>then we're going to start moving forward.</v>

3588
01:38:50.570 --> 01:38:52.670
<v Speaker 6>I think psychedelics has just kind of a shortcut,</v>

3589
01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:53.601
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

3590
01:38:53.601 --> 01:38:54.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3591
01:38:54.230 --> 01:38:56.150
<v Speaker 6>it just kind of upgrade you a little bit quicker,</v>

3592
01:38:56.510 --> 01:38:57.590
<v Speaker 6>see things a little clearer.</v>

3593
01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:58.160
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3594
01:38:58.160 --> 01:38:58.851
<v Speaker 6>like before it,</v>

3595
01:38:58.851 --> 01:38:59.750
<v Speaker 6>before my first,</v>

3596
01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.280
<v Speaker 6>my first ILS Alaska experience,</v>

3597
01:39:01.670 --> 01:39:04.220
<v Speaker 6>I always felt like I was in amongst my issues,</v>

3598
01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:07.550
<v Speaker 6>like the worst surrounding me and I couldn't really see clearly I couldn't get</v>

3599
01:39:07.551 --> 01:39:09.020
<v Speaker 6>the pieces in order to put them together.</v>

3600
01:39:09.021 --> 01:39:09.830
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3601
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:11.870
<v Speaker 6>And as soon as that first ceremony was over,</v>

3602
01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.380
<v Speaker 6>I felt like I could step back and look at all the pieces in front of me and like</v>

3603
01:39:15.381 --> 01:39:16.071
<v Speaker 6>piece things together.</v>

3604
01:39:16.071 --> 01:39:17.360
<v Speaker 6>Almost like everything's a game,</v>

3605
01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:18.021
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3606
01:39:18.021 --> 01:39:21.230
<v Speaker 6>And I think that was it to Tom Campbell you were talking to a while ago.</v>

3607
01:39:21.231 --> 01:39:22.640
<v Speaker 6>There's a video of you and him on,</v>

3608
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:24.170
<v Speaker 6>on Youtube talking.</v>

3609
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.740
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3610
01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:25.071
<v Speaker 6>and he's,</v>

3611
01:39:25.071 --> 01:39:28.200
<v Speaker 6>he's talking about the idea of a gamble.</v>

3612
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:29.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3613
01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:30.013
<v Speaker 6>Thomas Campbell</v>

3614
01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:32.633
<v Speaker 6>Soup Guy.</v>

3615
01:39:34.930 --> 01:39:35.763
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure that's his name.</v>

3616
01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:37.861
<v Speaker 6>It was like a total,</v>

3617
01:39:37.861 --> 01:39:39.080
<v Speaker 6>is it about what we were talking about?</v>

3618
01:39:39.110 --> 01:39:39.310
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3619
01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:39.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3620
01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:40.551
<v Speaker 6>just the idea.</v>

3621
01:39:40.551 --> 01:39:42.170
<v Speaker 6>He's light like the Matrix,</v>

3622
01:39:42.171 --> 01:39:43.100
<v Speaker 6>like it's a video game.</v>

3623
01:39:43.190 --> 01:39:44.023
<v Speaker 6>Like I,</v>

3624
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:44.571
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3625
01:39:44.571 --> 01:39:45.081
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

3626
01:39:45.081 --> 01:39:46.040
<v Speaker 1>I think they combined.</v>

3627
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.500
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3628
01:39:46.500 --> 01:39:47.060
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

3629
01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:47.350
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3630
01:39:47.350 --> 01:39:48.350
<v Speaker 6>And some things,</v>

3631
01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:49.211
<v Speaker 6>that's a good video.</v>

3632
01:39:49.211 --> 01:39:49.511
<v Speaker 6>Anyway.</v>

3633
01:39:49.511 --> 01:39:50.344
<v Speaker 6>That's a very interesting,</v>

3634
01:39:50.370 --> 01:39:50.791
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

3635
01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:50.971
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3636
01:39:50.971 --> 01:39:51.804
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is.</v>

3637
01:39:52.890 --> 01:39:53.640
<v Speaker 1>That there's,</v>

3638
01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:56.580
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that do these brilliant kind of animals together.</v>

3639
01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:56.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3640
01:39:56.761 --> 01:39:57.780
<v Speaker 1>They do them on their own.</v>

3641
01:39:57.810 --> 01:39:58.161
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

3642
01:39:58.161 --> 01:39:59.100
<v Speaker 1>no one tells him to do it.</v>

3643
01:39:59.130 --> 01:39:59.791
<v Speaker 1>They just do it.</v>

3644
01:39:59.791 --> 01:40:01.200
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many of them out there.</v>

3645
01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:02.140
<v Speaker 6>That's incredible.</v>

3646
01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:02.850
<v Speaker 6>But like,</v>

3647
01:40:02.850 --> 01:40:02.940
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3648
01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:03.820
<v Speaker 6>I kind of like,</v>

3649
01:40:03.821 --> 01:40:05.030
<v Speaker 6>my approach to life now is,</v>

3650
01:40:05.031 --> 01:40:05.151
<v Speaker 6>is,</v>

3651
01:40:05.151 --> 01:40:06.490
<v Speaker 6>is almost like a video game.</v>

3652
01:40:06.850 --> 01:40:07.240
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3653
01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:08.950
<v Speaker 6>like I'm constantly trying to level up.</v>

3654
01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:10.720
<v Speaker 6>I'm constantly trying to get to the next,</v>

3655
01:40:10.721 --> 01:40:12.430
<v Speaker 6>next stage to try and like,</v>

3656
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:14.140
<v Speaker 6>like forced evolution almost.</v>

3657
01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:14.680
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3658
01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:15.460
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3659
01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:18.520
<v Speaker 6>and I think that like we were talking about this the day,</v>

3660
01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.433
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3661
01:40:20.410 --> 01:40:21.000
<v Speaker 6>swimming in the,</v>

3662
01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:21.790
<v Speaker 6>in the lake,</v>

3663
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:22.560
<v Speaker 6>it's smoking weed,</v>

3664
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.020
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

3665
01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:26.260
<v Speaker 6>just kind of hanging out and all of a sudden it all kind of fell into place for</v>

3666
01:40:26.261 --> 01:40:27.094
<v Speaker 6>me.</v>

3667
01:40:27.370 --> 01:40:30.730
<v Speaker 6>Like there were certain people that that make an effort to,</v>

3668
01:40:30.731 --> 01:40:31.170
<v Speaker 6>to,</v>

3669
01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:31.730
<v Speaker 6>to reach,</v>

3670
01:40:31.730 --> 01:40:32.980
<v Speaker 6>reach a higher consciousness,</v>

3671
01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:33.400
<v Speaker 6>so that,</v>

3672
01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:34.420
<v Speaker 6>so imagine them as like,</v>

3673
01:40:34.421 --> 01:40:35.530
<v Speaker 6>as like bubbles on the table.</v>

3674
01:40:35.531 --> 01:40:38.740
<v Speaker 6>Imagine the tables full of bubbles and one of those people starts to drift off a</v>

3675
01:40:38.741 --> 01:40:42.550
<v Speaker 6>little quicker and that is going to create a reaction of the people around it.</v>

3676
01:40:42.551 --> 01:40:44.680
<v Speaker 6>And then they're going to pull up and occasionally you're going to get like a</v>

3677
01:40:44.681 --> 01:40:49.000
<v Speaker 6>Jim Morrison or a Hendrix or a Martin Luther King and they just kind of go by</v>

3678
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:50.560
<v Speaker 6>just pop and explode.</v>

3679
01:40:50.860 --> 01:40:51.740
<v Speaker 6>But they're cause such a,</v>

3680
01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:54.990
<v Speaker 6>such a ripple that they start to raise everybody else's consciousness.</v>

3681
01:40:55.440 --> 01:40:58.080
<v Speaker 6>So I think everybody has a responsibility to raise their own.</v>

3682
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.830
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3683
01:40:58.830 --> 01:40:59.790
<v Speaker 6>and by doing that,</v>

3684
01:41:00.030 --> 01:41:00.690
<v Speaker 6>we're going to,</v>

3685
01:41:00.690 --> 01:41:02.130
<v Speaker 6>we're going to affect the people around us.</v>

3686
01:41:02.670 --> 01:41:03.780
<v Speaker 6>That's a g hippie term.</v>

3687
01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:04.380
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

3688
01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:05.310
<v Speaker 6>Raise your consciousness.</v>

3689
01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:06.173
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

3690
01:41:06.230 --> 01:41:07.810
<v Speaker 6>It sounds like I am a filthy hip,</v>

3691
01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.930
<v Speaker 3>but it sounds like what to do.</v>

3692
01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's say if he's trying to fuck you try,</v>

3693
01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3694
01:41:14.161 --> 01:41:18.690
<v Speaker 3>just trying to raise your consciousness to that a few and I made love brings us</v>

3695
01:41:18.691 --> 01:41:19.524
<v Speaker 3>closer.</v>

3696
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.951
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

3697
01:41:19.951 --> 01:41:20.790
<v Speaker 3>that does sound like me.</v>

3698
01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:24.391
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3699
01:41:24.391 --> 01:41:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Dan Harney,</v>

3700
01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.351
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

3701
01:41:25.351 --> 01:41:26.290
<v Speaker 3>I know your tricks on,</v>

3702
01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:28.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3703
01:41:28.100 --> 01:41:31.160
<v Speaker 1>but what what you're saying though I agree with entirely,</v>

3704
01:41:31.161 --> 01:41:32.750
<v Speaker 1>even though it sounds like dirty hippy talk,</v>

3705
01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:36.920
<v Speaker 1>what you're saying is that we have to kind of realize that the only way to</v>

3706
01:41:36.921 --> 01:41:41.921
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy this life is you got to not just bring yourself up but bring up the</v>

3707
01:41:44.361 --> 01:41:45.260
<v Speaker 1>people around you.</v>

3708
01:41:45.261 --> 01:41:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And as they rise up it will rise you up as well.</v>

3709
01:41:47.841 --> 01:41:52.700
<v Speaker 1>And that we really all connected and it's your ego that keeps you from seeing</v>

3710
01:41:52.701 --> 01:41:57.410
<v Speaker 1>that it's your ego from trying to separate yourself from all these people that</v>

3711
01:41:57.411 --> 01:41:58.640
<v Speaker 1>are around you and sinking,</v>

3712
01:41:58.641 --> 01:41:59.480
<v Speaker 1>that you're on your own,</v>

3713
01:41:59.481 --> 01:42:00.291
<v Speaker 1>but you're not on your own.</v>

3714
01:42:00.291 --> 01:42:01.124
<v Speaker 1>No one's on their own.</v>

3715
01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:01.950
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

3716
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:02.530
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3717
01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:04.780
<v Speaker 6>and I struggled to come to terms with some things like the weight,</v>

3718
01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:05.673
<v Speaker 6>like Michael Vick,</v>

3719
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:06.161
<v Speaker 6>trees,</v>

3720
01:42:06.161 --> 01:42:10.210
<v Speaker 6>animals or like there's a documentary that's wait a while to go on youtube and I</v>

3721
01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:13.300
<v Speaker 6>apologize for anybody that watched it because it's the most awful thing I've</v>

3722
01:42:13.301 --> 01:42:13.601
<v Speaker 6>ever seen.</v>

3723
01:42:13.601 --> 01:42:16.190
<v Speaker 6>It's called earthlings and it's just a video of,</v>

3724
01:42:16.191 --> 01:42:19.690
<v Speaker 6>of of the different ways that humans use and treat animals.</v>

3725
01:42:19.900 --> 01:42:22.540
<v Speaker 6>And I got to like 26 minutes and I had to stop watching it.</v>

3726
01:42:22.541 --> 01:42:26.020
<v Speaker 6>It was so difficult and I always struggle with coming to terms with why that</v>

3727
01:42:26.021 --> 01:42:26.500
<v Speaker 6>happens.</v>

3728
01:42:26.500 --> 01:42:27.340
<v Speaker 6>Why is that there?</v>

3729
01:42:28.150 --> 01:42:28.361
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

3730
01:42:28.361 --> 01:42:32.290
<v Speaker 6>and my conclusion is that is that because it causes me to have a reaction to</v>

3731
01:42:32.291 --> 01:42:33.370
<v Speaker 6>have a feeling about it.</v>

3732
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:34.570
<v Speaker 6>So everybody that sees me,</v>

3733
01:42:34.571 --> 01:42:39.250
<v Speaker 6>every witnesses that will immediately form an opinion and that defines them a</v>

3734
01:42:39.251 --> 01:42:40.600
<v Speaker 6>little further to themselves.</v>

3735
01:42:40.650 --> 01:42:44.110
<v Speaker 6>W W we have to ask these questions about how do we feel about that?</v>

3736
01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.610
<v Speaker 6>That makes me feel uncomfortable.</v>

3737
01:42:45.730 --> 01:42:48.060
<v Speaker 6>I don't think that that's necessary and I don't want to watch that.</v>

3738
01:42:48.490 --> 01:42:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

3739
01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:49.751
<v Speaker 1>You'd also,</v>

3740
01:42:49.751 --> 01:42:51.310
<v Speaker 1>the reason why that exists,</v>

3741
01:42:51.311 --> 01:42:56.311
<v Speaker 1>the reason why those things can happen is that people are willing to overlook</v>

3742
01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:03.360
<v Speaker 1>normal human morals and values in favor of profits.</v>

3743
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3744
01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:04.780
<v Speaker 1>And when,</v>

3745
01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:05.531
<v Speaker 1>as soon as your,</v>

3746
01:43:05.531 --> 01:43:05.831
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3747
01:43:05.831 --> 01:43:06.611
<v Speaker 1>the numbers,</v>

3748
01:43:06.611 --> 01:43:08.740
<v Speaker 1>the one in the zero become the almighty,</v>

3749
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:12.880
<v Speaker 1>then you're fucked because then you're caught up in the wave of ones and Zeros</v>

3750
01:43:12.881 --> 01:43:13.391
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

3751
01:43:13.391 --> 01:43:15.090
<v Speaker 1>You can become just as disposables,</v>

3752
01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:15.671
<v Speaker 1>anybody else.</v>

3753
01:43:15.671 --> 01:43:15.851
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3754
01:43:15.851 --> 01:43:16.610
<v Speaker 1>you should just,</v>

3755
01:43:16.610 --> 01:43:21.610
<v Speaker 1>that alone should get people recognize that human humanely,</v>

3756
01:43:22.091 --> 01:43:25.060
<v Speaker 1>if you want to like get through this life humanely,</v>

3757
01:43:25.180 --> 01:43:30.180
<v Speaker 1>like you can not only look at the ones and Zeros because that's everything</v>

3758
01:43:30.191 --> 01:43:31.480
<v Speaker 1>that's fucked up about the world.</v>

3759
01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's war,</v>

3760
01:43:33.611 --> 01:43:36.100
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a manipulation of the markets,</v>

3761
01:43:36.370 --> 01:43:40.550
<v Speaker 1>whether it's controlling and actually all of it is about ones and zeros percent.</v>

3762
01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:41.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3763
01:43:41.330 --> 01:43:42.210
<v Speaker 6>And the people that have,</v>

3764
01:43:42.240 --> 01:43:43.110
<v Speaker 6>that have built this,</v>

3765
01:43:43.170 --> 01:43:44.400
<v Speaker 6>their society around it,</v>

3766
01:43:44.401 --> 01:43:46.440
<v Speaker 6>this operating system that we function under,</v>

3767
01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.570
<v Speaker 6>I've of that they've kind of,</v>

3768
01:43:48.571 --> 01:43:51.470
<v Speaker 6>they've kind of corralled into a position where we don't have to these,</v>

3769
01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:52.250
<v Speaker 6>these decisions.</v>

3770
01:43:52.250 --> 01:43:53.930
<v Speaker 4>We don't have to ask these questions about,</v>

3771
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3772
01:43:54.650 --> 01:43:55.220
<v Speaker 4>it does.</v>

3773
01:43:55.220 --> 01:43:56.210
<v Speaker 4>The Hummer that I drive,</v>

3774
01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:59.690
<v Speaker 4>drink far too much filled and Hamas having too much impact on my environment</v>

3775
01:43:59.691 --> 01:44:00.524
<v Speaker 4>around me.</v>

3776
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 4>Am I an asshole for driving it?</v>

3777
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:02.811
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

3778
01:44:02.811 --> 01:44:04.700
<v Speaker 4>It's that kind of people don't need to ask.</v>

3779
01:44:04.701 --> 01:44:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Then you see this as a man who loves classic cars and it's a love hate</v>

3780
01:44:08.481 --> 01:44:09.081
<v Speaker 4>relationship.</v>

3781
01:44:09.081 --> 01:44:09.381
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

3782
01:44:09.381 --> 01:44:13.580
<v Speaker 4>I have my Pontiac's sitting in the garage and I drive it probably once a month</v>

3783
01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:15.320
<v Speaker 4>and I've been talking about it,</v>

3784
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:18.110
<v Speaker 4>about selling it for a while and you're going to get a Prius,</v>

3785
01:44:18.111 --> 01:44:18.944
<v Speaker 4>Dan horny.</v>

3786
01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:22.011
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

3787
01:44:22.011 --> 01:44:22.844
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it for you.</v>

3788
01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:23.481
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is,</v>

3789
01:44:23.481 --> 01:44:24.650
<v Speaker 4>the thing that doesn't make any sense,</v>

3790
01:44:24.651 --> 01:44:26.480
<v Speaker 4>Shelby gt five hundreds of new ones,</v>

3791
01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:28.070
<v Speaker 4>pretty fucking good on gas.</v>

3792
01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:32.300
<v Speaker 4>It turns out a big powerful engine that's not working very hard.</v>

3793
01:44:32.301 --> 01:44:33.110
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty efficient.</v>

3794
01:44:33.110 --> 01:44:34.230
<v Speaker 4>But the thing is the technology.</v>

3795
01:44:35.020 --> 01:44:35.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3796
01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.760
<v Speaker 4>just get the dancing bears around your belly button.</v>

3797
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:38.663
<v Speaker 4>That's why.</v>

3798
01:44:39.290 --> 01:44:39.810
<v Speaker 4>But it's like,</v>

3799
01:44:39.810 --> 01:44:40.700
<v Speaker 4>like in the UK,</v>

3800
01:44:40.701 --> 01:44:41.300
<v Speaker 4>I had to,</v>

3801
01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:41.761
<v Speaker 4>I had a kid,</v>

3802
01:44:41.761 --> 01:44:44.510
<v Speaker 4>a sponsorship for a while in the UK and they would give me a new car.</v>

3803
01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:44.771
<v Speaker 4>But Tom,</v>

3804
01:44:44.771 --> 01:44:47.300
<v Speaker 4>I went back to drive and it was like what a thrill.</v>

3805
01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:48.220
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

3806
01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:49.190
<v Speaker 4>but seriously though,</v>

3807
01:44:49.191 --> 01:44:50.810
<v Speaker 4>like it was a 1.6 diesel,</v>

3808
01:44:50.811 --> 01:44:52.250
<v Speaker 4>they call it like 60 miles to the gallon.</v>

3809
01:44:53.170 --> 01:44:53.600
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3810
01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.260
<v Speaker 4>so why is that technology not making it over to the u s because it's boring as</v>

3811
01:44:57.261 --> 01:44:58.094
<v Speaker 4>fuck to drive.</v>

3812
01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.920
<v Speaker 4>There's no soul.</v>

3813
01:44:59.960 --> 01:45:01.350
<v Speaker 4>You can't listen to Prius.</v>

3814
01:45:01.390 --> 01:45:02.570
<v Speaker 4>Leonard Skinner did music,</v>

3815
01:45:02.571 --> 01:45:04.700
<v Speaker 4>we drive around in a Kia diesel.</v>

3816
01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:04.981
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3817
01:45:04.981 --> 01:45:06.710
<v Speaker 4>so the options are three hours that gets full.</v>

3818
01:45:08.120 --> 01:45:09.110
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't sound right.</v>

3819
01:45:09.111 --> 01:45:10.010
<v Speaker 4>You want to hear the engine,</v>

3820
01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:13.420
<v Speaker 4>you want to be able to shift your own gears,</v>

3821
01:45:13.421 --> 01:45:14.180
<v Speaker 4>son,</v>

3822
01:45:14.180 --> 01:45:15.530
<v Speaker 4>all these things that are dying off.</v>

3823
01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:17.160
<v Speaker 4>I'd be more that.</v>

3824
01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:18.440
<v Speaker 4>But then on the flip side,</v>

3825
01:45:18.441 --> 01:45:18.740
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3826
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.420
<v Speaker 4>should I drive a car that drinks so much fuel?</v>

3827
01:45:20.421 --> 01:45:21.200
<v Speaker 4>So eventually we can,</v>

3828
01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.550
<v Speaker 4>we can get through this quicker.</v>

3829
01:45:22.730 --> 01:45:24.360
<v Speaker 4>And then the people that have control of the fuel,</v>

3830
01:45:24.490 --> 01:45:27.170
<v Speaker 4>you will lose that power and then we can start thinking ahead,</v>

3831
01:45:27.171 --> 01:45:27.690
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3832
01:45:27.690 --> 01:45:28.830
<v Speaker 4>And then we need Hamline.</v>

3833
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:30.830
<v Speaker 4>It's Easel to run our muscle cars.</v>

3834
01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:32.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3835
01:45:32.650 --> 01:45:33.860
<v Speaker 4>it's a finite resource.</v>

3836
01:45:33.861 --> 01:45:36.320
<v Speaker 4>So maybe we should just get through it as quickly as possible.</v>

3837
01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:38.240
<v Speaker 4>It is a finite resource apparently,</v>

3838
01:45:38.241 --> 01:45:40.010
<v Speaker 4>but I don't understand how that works.</v>

3839
01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.840
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand how much oil is left.</v>

3840
01:45:42.370 --> 01:45:45.860
<v Speaker 4>You know the problem with one of those controversial subjects like peak oil is</v>

3841
01:45:45.861 --> 01:45:47.300
<v Speaker 4>when you hear those guys talk,</v>

3842
01:45:47.301 --> 01:45:48.680
<v Speaker 4>you don't know who the fuck is wrong.</v>

3843
01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.630
<v Speaker 4>You know this guy saying,</v>

3844
01:45:51.250 --> 01:45:55.690
<v Speaker 4>I read a book called black gold stranglehold that was claiming that oil is a re</v>

3845
01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:57.680
<v Speaker 4>repeatably made,</v>

3846
01:45:57.710 --> 01:46:02.710
<v Speaker 4>repeatedly made fluid and that wells that have gone dry,</v>

3847
01:46:03.050 --> 01:46:04.190
<v Speaker 4>if you give them enough time,</v>

3848
01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:05.570
<v Speaker 4>they started producing oil again.</v>

3849
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:08.390
<v Speaker 4>The thing is that the only people that know the real facts of the people that</v>

3850
01:46:08.391 --> 01:46:09.350
<v Speaker 4>are in control anyway,</v>

3851
01:46:09.351 --> 01:46:10.670
<v Speaker 4>so why would they tell us the truth?</v>

3852
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:11.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3853
01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:11.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3854
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:14.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean the idea that anybody could own the oil.</v>

3855
01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:15.740
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's ridiculous.</v>

3856
01:46:15.741 --> 01:46:16.411
<v Speaker 4>That's the whole earth.</v>

3857
01:46:16.411 --> 01:46:18.830
<v Speaker 4>You fuck me over there?</v>

3858
01:46:18.831 --> 01:46:20.540
<v Speaker 4>And your metal boxes getting his con.</v>

3859
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:21.540
<v Speaker 4>But I'll say this about like,</v>

3860
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:22.520
<v Speaker 4>like Red Rock Canyon.</v>

3861
01:46:22.521 --> 01:46:24.410
<v Speaker 4>Like I go out there hiking and I'll get there at like,</v>

3862
01:46:24.411 --> 01:46:24.770
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3863
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:26.570
<v Speaker 4>four 50 in the park closes at five.</v>

3864
01:46:26.960 --> 01:46:27.711
<v Speaker 4>It's a mountain.</v>

3865
01:46:27.711 --> 01:46:28.670
<v Speaker 4>How does it close?</v>

3866
01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:29.673
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3867
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:31.731
<v Speaker 4>You know what?</v>

3868
01:46:31.731 --> 01:46:32.361
<v Speaker 4>That's from there.</v>

3869
01:46:32.361 --> 01:46:35.810
<v Speaker 4>They know what they're tired of picking people's pieces and having people there,</v>

3870
01:46:35.811 --> 01:46:36.261
<v Speaker 4>so listen,</v>

3871
01:46:36.261 --> 01:46:36.800
<v Speaker 4>you fucks.</v>

3872
01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.850
<v Speaker 4>You can't be,</v>

3873
01:46:37.851 --> 01:46:39.860
<v Speaker 4>can't be out here because it's dangerous.</v>

3874
01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:42.470
<v Speaker 4>Too many you dummies get drunk and fall off cliffs and die.</v>

3875
01:46:42.530 --> 01:46:45.320
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think those dummies should get drunk and fall off cliffs and die.</v>

3876
01:46:45.630 --> 01:46:48.350
<v Speaker 4>That's the way a thin in the hood without is actually going out and shooting</v>

3877
01:46:48.351 --> 01:46:49.050
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3878
01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:49.883
<v Speaker 4>You son,</v>

3879
01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.000
<v Speaker 4>you know there was a,</v>

3880
01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:56.130
<v Speaker 4>there was a woman who recently died like this this week in France and she fell</v>

3881
01:46:56.131 --> 01:46:58.800
<v Speaker 4>from like 900 feet off the top of a cliff.</v>

3882
01:46:59.010 --> 01:47:00.690
<v Speaker 4>By the time they got down to her,</v>

3883
01:47:00.810 --> 01:47:02.460
<v Speaker 4>the vultures had already eaten her.</v>

3884
01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Oh well that saves carrying a back.</v>

3885
01:47:04.730 --> 01:47:05.563
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

3886
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:07.760
<v Speaker 6>That's one way to look at it.</v>

3887
01:47:08.310 --> 01:47:09.500
<v Speaker 6>Let's just take all of light.</v>

3888
01:47:09.501 --> 01:47:09.740
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3889
01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.240
<v Speaker 6>all of the safety precautions that we,</v>

3890
01:47:11.241 --> 01:47:16.070
<v Speaker 6>I'm like fences around like moving parts and like crossings.</v>

3891
01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.430
<v Speaker 6>If you can't make it across the street without getting hit by a car.</v>

3892
01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:20.390
<v Speaker 6>Another thing as well.</v>

3893
01:47:20.391 --> 01:47:22.700
<v Speaker 6>And I have a lot of people that disagreed with me when I spoke about this on</v>

3894
01:47:22.701 --> 01:47:23.534
<v Speaker 6>Twitter,</v>

3895
01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:25.880
<v Speaker 6>50 mile an hour zones around schools.</v>

3896
01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:26.470
<v Speaker 6>Like if,</v>

3897
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

3898
01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.760
<v Speaker 6>if all the time when when I went I was a kid,</v>

3899
01:47:28.761 --> 01:47:31.580
<v Speaker 6>I grew up around cause move moving at 50 miles an hour,</v>

3900
01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.550
<v Speaker 6>why would I ever take them seriously as a threat?</v>

3901
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.991
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

3902
01:47:37.991 --> 01:47:42.030
<v Speaker 6>like we need to do things because these things are fucking dangerous.</v>

3903
01:47:42.080 --> 01:47:42.351
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3904
01:47:42.351 --> 01:47:43.161
<v Speaker 6>that's totally true.</v>

3905
01:47:43.161 --> 01:47:43.671
<v Speaker 6>So we need to,</v>

3906
01:47:43.671 --> 01:47:45.200
<v Speaker 6>we need to learn to be careful about it,</v>

3907
01:47:45.230 --> 01:47:46.490
<v Speaker 6>but it's all about education.</v>

3908
01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:47.400
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

3909
01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.211
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

3910
01:47:48.211 --> 01:47:49.710
<v Speaker 4>But to play devil's advocate,</v>

3911
01:47:49.711 --> 01:47:53.100
<v Speaker 4>there's too many dumb cunts out there that need a sign that it gives them an</v>

3912
01:47:53.101 --> 01:47:54.240
<v Speaker 4>unreasonable speed limits.</v>

3913
01:47:54.241 --> 01:47:56.760
<v Speaker 4>Just say slow the fuck down when they were around schools,</v>

3914
01:47:56.910 --> 01:47:59.730
<v Speaker 4>like our friends that we're talking about speeding and texting,</v>

3915
01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:02.430
<v Speaker 4>you can't have a 60 mile an hour speed limit in front of a school with that</v>

3916
01:48:02.431 --> 01:48:03.121
<v Speaker 4>asshole driving.</v>

3917
01:48:03.121 --> 01:48:03.420
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3918
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:05.220
<v Speaker 4>Cause someone's little kids going flying over the hood.</v>

3919
01:48:06.010 --> 01:48:09.330
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't want it to be a little Dan Hardee and it's an awful thing.</v>

3920
01:48:09.331 --> 01:48:13.200
<v Speaker 4>But the 40 miles now are smart because kids also are stupid and they tend to</v>

3921
01:48:13.201 --> 01:48:14.880
<v Speaker 4>jump into traffic and that,</v>

3922
01:48:14.890 --> 01:48:15.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3923
01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:15.941
<v Speaker 6>oh my lord,</v>

3924
01:48:15.941 --> 01:48:17.570
<v Speaker 6>my piece of paper,</v>

3925
01:48:17.571 --> 01:48:18.051
<v Speaker 6>Shit,</v>

3926
01:48:18.051 --> 01:48:18.710
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3927
01:48:18.710 --> 01:48:23.420
<v Speaker 6>I need to fucking pass this class and they run out into the street and boom,</v>

3928
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:24.710
<v Speaker 6>you got to be able to hit that break.</v>

3929
01:48:24.740 --> 01:48:25.573
<v Speaker 6>You fuck</v>

3930
01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:27.651
<v Speaker 6>fuck you.</v>

3931
01:48:27.651 --> 01:48:28.484
<v Speaker 6>Oh Man.</v>

3932
01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:32.150
<v Speaker 6>I don't ever remember anybody getting hit by a car outside of school when I was</v>

3933
01:48:32.151 --> 01:48:33.400
<v Speaker 6>a kid and I'm,</v>

3934
01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:37.010
<v Speaker 6>we have a 45 mile and at 40 mile an hour zone outside of my school.</v>

3935
01:48:37.100 --> 01:48:39.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure somebody did see a woman get hit by a truck broke</v>

3936
01:48:39.220 --> 01:48:39.640
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3937
01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

3938
01:48:40.130 --> 01:48:41.510
<v Speaker 4>she got shot at groceries on the,</v>

3939
01:48:41.511 --> 01:48:42.230
<v Speaker 4>on the handle bar.</v>

3940
01:48:42.230 --> 01:48:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

3941
01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:44.360
<v Speaker 4>How bad was that?</v>

3942
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.870
<v Speaker 4>Bad.</v>

3943
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:45.890
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus.</v>

3944
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.561
<v Speaker 4>Fucking,</v>

3945
01:48:48.561 --> 01:48:49.394
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>

3946
01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.000
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

3947
01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:50.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to see that,</v>

3948
01:48:50.961 --> 01:48:51.794
<v Speaker 4>but I have,</v>

3949
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:52.970
<v Speaker 4>that's the problem with the Internet.</v>

3950
01:48:52.971 --> 01:48:54.830
<v Speaker 4>I've seen everything at this point.</v>

3951
01:48:54.831 --> 01:48:55.700
<v Speaker 4>You've seen so much.</v>

3952
01:48:55.730 --> 01:48:58.160
<v Speaker 4>If you watched the video of the monk set himself on fire from,</v>

3953
01:48:58.190 --> 01:48:59.023
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

3954
01:48:59.150 --> 01:49:01.190
<v Speaker 4>I spent a day watching that over and over again.</v>

3955
01:49:01.250 --> 01:49:02.210
<v Speaker 4>The one from Vietnam.</v>

3956
01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:03.650
<v Speaker 4>How do you,</v>

3957
01:49:03.650 --> 01:49:04.720
<v Speaker 4>how do you prepare yourself?</v>

3958
01:49:04.721 --> 01:49:05.960
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even fucking move.</v>

3959
01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:06.330
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3960
01:49:06.330 --> 01:49:07.580
<v Speaker 4>he never like,</v>

3961
01:49:07.610 --> 01:49:11.480
<v Speaker 4>he never panicked and he stayed in the Lotus position and keep taking something</v>

3962
01:49:11.481 --> 01:49:12.110
<v Speaker 4>to numb it.</v>

3963
01:49:12.110 --> 01:49:12.650
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

3964
01:49:12.650 --> 01:49:13.690
<v Speaker 4>I do not believe so.</v>

3965
01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.360
<v Speaker 4>So if you're going to light yourself on fire,</v>

3966
01:49:16.370 --> 01:49:17.390
<v Speaker 4>what fucking difference does it make?</v>

3967
01:49:17.391 --> 01:49:18.224
<v Speaker 4>How you doing?</v>

3968
01:49:18.270 --> 01:49:19.101
<v Speaker 4>Light yourself on fire,</v>

3969
01:49:19.101 --> 01:49:19.400
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

3970

<v Speaker 4>It's going to get kind of woman to,</v>

3978
01:49:30.170 --> 01:49:31.130
<v Speaker 4>I know where the fuck it happened.</v>

3979
01:49:31.610 --> 01:49:33.590
<v Speaker 4>Some in some Asian country,</v>

3980
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:37.970
<v Speaker 4>there was a carnival show where a bear was on a bicycle,</v>

3981
01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:38.661
<v Speaker 4>so he would pull it up.</v>

3982
01:49:38.661 --> 01:49:39.494
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

3983
01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:44.330

3989
01:49:51.491 --> 01:49:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3990
01:49:51.880 --> 01:49:52.720

3997
01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:58.240
<v Speaker 1>The monkey,</v>

3998
01:49:58.260 --> 01:49:58.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3999
01:49:58.550 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Speaker 1>crashes a bike and the bear crashes into the monkeys bike when it's on the</v>

4000
01:50:03.371 --> 01:50:05.380
<v Speaker 1>ground and just decides to eat the monkey.</v>

4001
01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:06.551
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

4002
01:50:06.551 --> 01:50:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

4003
01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:08.110
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

4004
01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:08.891
<v Speaker 1>So watch this.</v>

4005
01:50:08.891 --> 01:50:09.311
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

4006
01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:10.210
<v Speaker 1>The monkey crashes.</v>

4007
01:50:10.330 --> 01:50:11.380
<v Speaker 1>The bear crashes on them.</v>

4008
01:50:11.381 --> 01:50:11.651
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4009
01:50:11.651 --> 01:50:12.190
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

4010
01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:13.150
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm just gonna eat you</v>

4011
01:50:14.650 --> 01:50:16.810
<v Speaker 1>and just fucking malls that monkey.</v>

4012
01:50:16.811 --> 01:50:21.190
<v Speaker 1>And they're all grabbing him and pulling the monkey away and look at this,</v>

4013
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:23.830
<v Speaker 1>that monkeys Foxville son,</v>

4014
01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.330
<v Speaker 1>that bear is just going off on that monkey.</v>

4015
01:50:26.331 --> 01:50:26.621
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4016
01:50:26.621 --> 01:50:27.580
<v Speaker 1>you stupid bitch.</v>

4017
01:50:27.581 --> 01:50:29.140
<v Speaker 1>You dropped your fucking bike.</v>

4018
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.891
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

4019
01:50:29.891 --> 01:50:32.620
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking about eating you for months.</v>

4020
01:50:35.290 --> 01:50:38.500
<v Speaker 1>I bet his instincts where when something goes down in front of you,</v>

4021
01:50:38.501 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 1>you just start eating it.</v>

4022
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4023
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:40.290
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

4024
01:50:40.290 --> 01:50:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4025
01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I think that's like bare one-on-one,</v>

4026
01:50:42.580 --> 01:50:43.413
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4027
01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:46.510
<v Speaker 1>If you're a bear and some shit trips in front of you like that,</v>

4028
01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:48.920
<v Speaker 1>you just started eating like you got a gift from the gods.</v>

4029
01:50:48.921 --> 01:50:49.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4030
01:50:49.630 --> 01:50:50.740
<v Speaker 1>How could you not do that?</v>

4031
01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:52.480
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not?</v>

4032
01:50:52.480 --> 01:50:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4033
01:50:52.810 --> 01:50:54.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't train bear stupid.</v>

4034
01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.450
<v Speaker 1>You think you train bears.</v>

4035
01:50:55.451 --> 01:50:56.440
<v Speaker 1>He trained for a little bit.</v>

4036
01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:58.870
<v Speaker 1>We got him to ride a bike and while he's riding that bike,</v>

4037
01:50:58.871 --> 01:50:59.141
<v Speaker 1>he's going,</v>

4038
01:50:59.141 --> 01:51:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat that monkey God.</v>

4039
01:51:01.420 --> 01:51:01.960
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

4040
01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:02.793
<v Speaker 1>Eat that monkey.</v>

4041
01:51:04.930 --> 01:51:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Not many times you can use that sentence.</v>

4042
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4043
01:51:06.821 --> 01:51:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Unless you Joey Diaz,</v>

4044
01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you use it all day.</v>

4045
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:11.830
<v Speaker 1>We thought Monkey Cock sucker.</v>

4046
01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4047
01:51:13.060 --> 01:51:15.970
<v Speaker 1>so you had all these experiences.</v>

4048
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Did it make you look at fighting any differently?</v>

4049
01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:20.160
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4050
01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:20.670
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4051
01:51:20.670 --> 01:51:21.503
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4052
01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:27.300
<v Speaker 6>this is going to sound kind of odd because I carried on fighting after the</v>

4053
01:51:27.301 --> 01:51:27.751
<v Speaker 6>experience,</v>

4054
01:51:27.751 --> 01:51:29.490
<v Speaker 6>but I kind of saw the futility in it,</v>

4055
01:51:29.491 --> 01:51:30.540
<v Speaker 6>the pointlessness in it,</v>

4056
01:51:31.050 --> 01:51:31.680
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

4057
01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:31.980
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4058
01:51:31.980 --> 01:51:34.710
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's a British comedy that,</v>

4059
01:51:34.711 --> 01:51:35.190
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4060
01:51:35.190 --> 01:51:36.540
<v Speaker 6>that kind of captures it really well.</v>

4061
01:51:36.541 --> 01:51:37.800
<v Speaker 6>They do like a parody of a,</v>

4062
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:38.191
<v Speaker 6>like a,</v>

4063
01:51:38.191 --> 01:51:40.230
<v Speaker 6>a soccer commercial and the like,</v>

4064
01:51:40.231 --> 01:51:40.471
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4065
01:51:40.471 --> 01:51:42.560
<v Speaker 6>talking about Manchester United and Arsenal then,</v>

4066
01:51:42.900 --> 01:51:43.470
<v Speaker 6>and they'll,</v>

4067
01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:46.620
<v Speaker 6>they'll win and they'll see who wins now and then next year it will carry on</v>

4068
01:51:46.621 --> 01:51:48.510
<v Speaker 6>just the same and there'll be more guys that win.</v>

4069
01:51:48.511 --> 01:51:49.021
<v Speaker 6>And you know what I mean?</v>

4070
01:51:49.021 --> 01:51:49.711
<v Speaker 6>It's the same thing.</v>

4071
01:51:49.711 --> 01:51:51.510
<v Speaker 6>Like I can be the champion for 10 years,</v>

4072
01:51:51.511 --> 01:51:53.220
<v Speaker 6>but once that 11th years comes,</v>

4073
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:54.900
<v Speaker 6>there's going to be somebody else's champion.</v>

4074
01:51:54.901 --> 01:51:56.580
<v Speaker 6>And it will just continue on forever.</v>

4075
01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:57.330
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4076
01:51:57.330 --> 01:51:57.590
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>

4077
01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:57.820
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4078
01:51:57.820 --> 01:51:58.653
<v Speaker 6>it's the,</v>

4079
01:51:58.850 --> 01:51:59.140
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

4080
01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:00.900
<v Speaker 6>it's the absolute core of,</v>

4081
01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:01.171
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>

4082
01:52:01.171 --> 01:52:05.430
<v Speaker 6>of the capitalist approach to life is to actually beat someone down to take food</v>

4083
01:52:05.431 --> 01:52:06.270
<v Speaker 6>out of their mouth,</v>

4084
01:52:06.810 --> 01:52:08.040
<v Speaker 6>which is really kind of odd.</v>

4085
01:52:08.041 --> 01:52:09.570
<v Speaker 6>And I've never seen it like that before.</v>

4086
01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:10.261
<v Speaker 6>Normally it's like,</v>

4087
01:52:10.261 --> 01:52:10.381
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

4088
01:52:10.381 --> 01:52:10.860
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna,</v>

4089
01:52:10.860 --> 01:52:11.820
<v Speaker 6>I'm gonna beat the hell out of that guy.</v>

4090
01:52:11.821 --> 01:52:13.140
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to take what he's got.</v>

4091
01:52:13.890 --> 01:52:14.610
<v Speaker 6>But now I,</v>

4092
01:52:14.610 --> 01:52:15.001
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

4093
01:52:15.001 --> 01:52:15.834
<v Speaker 6>I'm kind of,</v>

4094
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.620
<v Speaker 6>I liked the,</v>

4095
01:52:16.620 --> 01:52:17.453
<v Speaker 6>I liked the,</v>

4096
01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:19.170
<v Speaker 6>I liked the competition.</v>

4097
01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:20.010
<v Speaker 6>I liked the,</v>

4098
01:52:20.010 --> 01:52:22.890
<v Speaker 6>the actual physical test of fighting,</v>

4099
01:52:23.460 --> 01:52:24.840
<v Speaker 6>but not for the same reasons.</v>

4100
01:52:24.841 --> 01:52:25.140
<v Speaker 6>Not,</v>

4101
01:52:25.140 --> 01:52:27.360
<v Speaker 6>not to like to be more successful than you know,</v>

4102
01:52:27.361 --> 01:52:28.194
<v Speaker 6>to</v>

4103
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:29.323
<v Speaker 1>can you can,</v>

4104
01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.550
<v Speaker 1>can you continue with the same passion,</v>

4105
01:52:31.730 --> 01:52:34.430
<v Speaker 1>having different ideas of what's important about finding?</v>

4106
01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:35.161
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4107
01:52:35.161 --> 01:52:35.461
<v Speaker 6>because,</v>

4108
01:52:35.461 --> 01:52:36.294
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4109
01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:37.600
<v Speaker 6>the one thing that I,</v>

4110
01:52:37.610 --> 01:52:39.780
<v Speaker 6>that was really starting to focus on,</v>

4111
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:40.280
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4112
01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:40.850
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4113
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:44.550
<v Speaker 6>with the MEF fight since I went to Peru with the Mfi and I go going into the</v>

4114
01:52:44.551 --> 01:52:45.420
<v Speaker 6>Brown fight as well.</v>

4115
01:52:45.421 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 6>And,</v>

4116
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 6>and this</v>

4117
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.120
<v Speaker 4>is the reason why I would,</v>

4118
01:52:47.150 --> 01:52:48.400
<v Speaker 4>I would at least like the option to,</v>

4119
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:49.600
<v Speaker 4>to carry on fighting.</v>

4120
01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:49.851
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4121
01:52:49.851 --> 01:52:51.560
<v Speaker 4>I would like to be able to get cleared so I can,</v>

4122
01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:52.460
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4123
01:52:52.460 --> 01:52:53.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I'll go back to flying,</v>

4124
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:54.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4125
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:58.640
<v Speaker 4>three times a year and chasing the belt because my focus is elsewhere now.</v>

4126
01:52:59.000 --> 01:52:59.833
<v Speaker 4>Where's your focus?</v>

4127
01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:01.483
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4128
01:53:01.730 --> 01:53:03.200
<v Speaker 4>there's a space that you get to.</v>

4129
01:53:03.201 --> 01:53:04.370
<v Speaker 4>When do you read much?</v>

4130
01:53:04.371 --> 01:53:05.120
<v Speaker 4>Carl Sagan?</v>

4131
01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:06.740
<v Speaker 4>You read the dragons of Eden.</v>

4132
01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:09.200
<v Speaker 4>How about the tree and brain and the,</v>

4133
01:53:09.610 --> 01:53:10.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4134
01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:10.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to,</v>

4135
01:53:10.730 --> 01:53:13.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to like understand the distinction between the different areas of the</v>

4136
01:53:13.431 --> 01:53:13.641
<v Speaker 4>brain.</v>

4137
01:53:13.641 --> 01:53:14.421
<v Speaker 4>The reptilian brain,</v>

4138
01:53:14.421 --> 01:53:16.130
<v Speaker 4>which is obviously responsible for all the,</v>

4139
01:53:16.131 --> 01:53:16.450
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4140
01:53:16.450 --> 01:53:16.960
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4141
01:53:16.960 --> 01:53:17.870
<v Speaker 4>the aggressiveness,</v>

4142
01:53:17.871 --> 01:53:18.081
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4143
01:53:18.081 --> 01:53:19.190
<v Speaker 4>the instinctual stuff.</v>

4144
01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:20.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4145
01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:20.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4146
01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:20.420
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4147
01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:20.601
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

4148
01:53:20.601 --> 01:53:23.180
<v Speaker 4>the fights and the killing and all that kind of,</v>

4149
01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.380
<v Speaker 4>that's the reptilian brain.</v>

4150
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:26.240
<v Speaker 4>The political side of it is basically,</v>

4151
01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:27.643
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4152
01:53:27.710 --> 01:53:28.401
<v Speaker 4>and then after that,</v>

4153
01:53:28.401 --> 01:53:29.720
<v Speaker 4>then you've got like the old mammalian brain,</v>

4154
01:53:29.721 --> 01:53:33.440
<v Speaker 4>which is where we start to make kind of like basic connections with people and</v>

4155
01:53:33.441 --> 01:53:34.850
<v Speaker 4>understand that if we work as a group,</v>

4156
01:53:34.851 --> 01:53:35.420
<v Speaker 4>we can,</v>

4157
01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:35.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4158
01:53:35.660 --> 01:53:36.770
<v Speaker 4>we can survive better.</v>

4159
01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:38.300
<v Speaker 4>And then the next level up is,</v>

4160
01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:40.170
<v Speaker 4>is obviously a higher consciousness is,</v>

4161
01:53:40.171 --> 01:53:42.110
<v Speaker 4>is having deeper understanding,</v>

4162
01:53:42.111 --> 01:53:44.750
<v Speaker 4>deeper relationships and communications with people around you.</v>

4163
01:53:45.560 --> 01:53:47.300
<v Speaker 4>But there's a point when you fight,</v>

4164
01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:50.150
<v Speaker 4>where were the reptilian brain takes over.</v>

4165
01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:52.910
<v Speaker 4>And I usually feel it after I've been cracked a couple of times.</v>

4166
01:53:52.911 --> 01:53:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Like when I was fighting Ludwig in,</v>

4167
01:53:54.210 --> 01:53:54.630
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4168
01:53:54.630 --> 01:53:55.490
<v Speaker 4>at the MGM,</v>

4169
01:53:56.510 --> 01:54:00.410
<v Speaker 4>I was very conscious for the first 30 or 30 seconds or so of the five.</v>

4170
01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.760
<v Speaker 4>And then as I stepped in,</v>

4171
01:54:01.761 --> 01:54:01.960
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4172
01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:04.760
<v Speaker 4>you remember he cracked me with that right hand route and the Chin and I rushed</v>

4173
01:54:04.761 --> 01:54:09.590
<v Speaker 4>him up against the fence and immediately I switched over to to instinct.</v>

4174
01:54:09.650 --> 01:54:10.483
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

4175
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:11.720
<v Speaker 4>it's like being a passenger.</v>

4176
01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:13.100
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm not,</v>

4177
01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:15.110
<v Speaker 4>I have no conscious,</v>

4178
01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:16.400
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4179
01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:17.990
<v Speaker 4>decision making ability in that,</v>

4180
01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:18.740
<v Speaker 4>in that time.</v>

4181
01:54:18.740 --> 01:54:19.700
<v Speaker 4>It's all instinct.</v>

4182
01:54:19.701 --> 01:54:20.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

4183
01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:21.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm not focused at all on,</v>

4184
01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:23.090
<v Speaker 4>on what he's doing.</v>

4185
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.930
<v Speaker 4>I'm just reading,</v>

4186
01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:25.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm just feeling and,</v>

4187
01:54:25.431 --> 01:54:25.650
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

4188
01:54:25.650 --> 01:54:25.911
<v Speaker 4>and I,</v>

4189
01:54:25.911 --> 01:54:26.361
<v Speaker 4>I want it.</v>

4190
01:54:26.361 --> 01:54:27.680
<v Speaker 4>I want to find if I can get,</v>

4191
01:54:27.710 --> 01:54:30.410
<v Speaker 4>I want to see if I can get to that place for a longer period of time.</v>

4192
01:54:30.930 --> 01:54:31.341
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

4193
01:54:31.341 --> 01:54:32.300
<v Speaker 4>Like with the Amea fight,</v>

4194
01:54:32.301 --> 01:54:33.920
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I would slip in and out of it,</v>

4195
01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:36.110
<v Speaker 4>like let the first round it was,</v>

4196
01:54:36.111 --> 01:54:38.300
<v Speaker 4>it was so overwhelming because it was hometown,</v>

4197
01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:38.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4198
01:54:38.781 --> 01:54:41.180
<v Speaker 4>my name was being showered by you know,</v>

4199
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:42.870
<v Speaker 4>8,000 people or something and,</v>

4200
01:54:43.210 --> 01:54:43.590
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4201
01:54:43.590 --> 01:54:44.330
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

4202
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:45.350
<v Speaker 4>I live next to the arena.</v>

4203
01:54:45.351 --> 01:54:46.940
<v Speaker 4>So it occurred to me that if I lost,</v>

4204
01:54:47.030 --> 01:54:50.060
<v Speaker 4>that would be on my mind every time I looked out my window.</v>

4205
01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:53.510
<v Speaker 4>So the first round I lost it.</v>

4206
01:54:53.511 --> 01:54:54.081
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just,</v>

4207
01:54:54.081 --> 01:54:57.440
<v Speaker 4>I just kind of moved around and backed up and when I sat down in my corner after</v>

4208
01:54:57.441 --> 01:54:57.951
<v Speaker 4>the first round,</v>

4209
01:54:57.951 --> 01:54:59.060
<v Speaker 4>I apologize to my team.</v>

4210
01:54:59.060 --> 01:54:59.331
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

4211
01:54:59.331 --> 01:54:59.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

4212
01:54:59.631 --> 01:55:00.860
<v Speaker 4>I just had to get that out of the way.</v>

4213
01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:02.630
<v Speaker 4>But then the second and third round,</v>

4214
01:55:02.631 --> 01:55:03.930
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I could reach that,</v>

4215
01:55:04.090 --> 01:55:07.580
<v Speaker 4>that stage sometime where I just kind of allow my body to take over and just</v>

4216
01:55:07.581 --> 01:55:09.590
<v Speaker 4>switch off and in the face we would just watch.</v>

4217
01:55:09.740 --> 01:55:11.180
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's what Anderson is doing?</v>

4218
01:55:11.300 --> 01:55:12.080
<v Speaker 4>I think is that,</v>

4219
01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:13.190
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly what he's doing.</v>

4220
01:55:13.191 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4221
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:14.780
<v Speaker 4>But I don't know as he's,</v>

4222
01:55:14.781 --> 01:55:16.730
<v Speaker 4>as he's aware of himself doing it.</v>

4223
01:55:17.930 --> 01:55:18.610
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

4224
01:55:18.610 --> 01:55:19.251
<v Speaker 4>It's so good.</v>

4225
01:55:19.251 --> 01:55:19.521
<v Speaker 4>It does.</v>

4226
01:55:19.521 --> 01:55:20.330
<v Speaker 4>How he locked it in.</v>

4227
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4228
01:55:20.780 --> 01:55:21.291
<v Speaker 4>I just think,</v>

4229
01:55:21.291 --> 01:55:22.510
<v Speaker 4>I just think when the fight starts,</v>

4230
01:55:22.511 --> 01:55:23.510
<v Speaker 4>he immediately switches over.</v>

4231
01:55:23.511 --> 01:55:23.781
<v Speaker 4>But you,</v>

4232
01:55:23.781 --> 01:55:25.130
<v Speaker 4>you can see it in people's eyes.</v>

4233
01:55:25.131 --> 01:55:26.630
<v Speaker 4>Like vandelays a great example.</v>

4234
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:29.420
<v Speaker 4>If you watch one vandelays highlight reels where he's got a few of his stare</v>

4235
01:55:29.421 --> 01:55:29.721
<v Speaker 4>downs,</v>

4236
01:55:29.721 --> 01:55:32.380
<v Speaker 4>he immediately switches to reptile mode as soon as he's fighting.</v>

4237
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:33.950
<v Speaker 4>That's a great way of putting it with him too.</v>

4238
01:55:34.420 --> 01:55:34.821
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

4239
01:55:34.821 --> 01:55:35.250
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

4240
01:55:35.250 --> 01:55:37.190
<v Speaker 4>and like man Hoff is another one.</v>

4241
01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:38.530
<v Speaker 4>Those guys that have just,</v>

4242
01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.490
<v Speaker 4>they've just got that light instinctual rage.</v>

4243
01:55:40.620 --> 01:55:41.780
<v Speaker 4>It just kind of comes on.</v>

4244
01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.150
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

4245
01:55:43.150 --> 01:55:44.220
<v Speaker 4>and this is why like,</v>

4246
01:55:44.221 --> 01:55:44.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4247
01:55:44.431 --> 01:55:44.591
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

4248
01:55:44.591 --> 01:55:46.200
<v Speaker 4>I've always kind of heard the term,</v>

4249
01:55:46.201 --> 01:55:46.430
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4250
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:47.263
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4251
01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:51.160
<v Speaker 4>you mean 20 even 10 20% of the things that you learned in the gym and natural</v>

4252
01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:51.580
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>

4253
01:55:51.580 --> 01:55:51.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4254
01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:52.611
<v Speaker 4>when adrenaline and,</v>

4255
01:55:52.611 --> 01:55:52.821
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4256
01:55:52.821 --> 01:55:54.030
<v Speaker 4>and the actual fight is,</v>

4257
01:55:54.460 --> 01:55:55.380
<v Speaker 4>is occurring,</v>

4258
01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:56.900
<v Speaker 4>you only kind of maintain,</v>

4259
01:55:56.970 --> 01:55:59.370
<v Speaker 4>like keep about 20% of what you've learned in the gym.</v>

4260
01:55:59.371 --> 01:56:01.560
<v Speaker 4>So the idea has been in the gym,</v>

4261
01:56:01.561 --> 01:56:06.090
<v Speaker 4>you train yourself to the point where it does become instinct and then when the</v>

4262
01:56:06.091 --> 01:56:09.840
<v Speaker 4>fight happens you just switched to reptile mode and reptile mode uses the skills</v>

4263
01:56:09.841 --> 01:56:12.510
<v Speaker 4>that you learn to to get the job done more efficiently.</v>

4264
01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:18.180
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that becoming more aware or reaching a higher state of</v>

4265
01:56:18.181 --> 01:56:21.690
<v Speaker 4>consciousness because of your experiences will actually help you because it will</v>

4266
01:56:21.691 --> 01:56:26.190
<v Speaker 4>abandon a lot of the distractions that you present yourself almost unknowingly?</v>

4267
01:56:26.460 --> 01:56:26.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4268
01:56:26.701 --> 01:56:28.140
<v Speaker 4>well it helps me,</v>

4269
01:56:28.141 --> 01:56:31.770
<v Speaker 4>it helps me in training and particularly in when I'm running now because I used</v>

4270
01:56:31.771 --> 01:56:34.640
<v Speaker 4>to listen to like Pantera and yeah,</v>

4271
01:56:34.650 --> 01:56:35.700
<v Speaker 4>like vision of disorder.</v>

4272
01:56:35.710 --> 01:56:39.510
<v Speaker 4>When I was running I'd worked myself into like a rage so I wouldn't run to</v>

4273
01:56:39.511 --> 01:56:40.171
<v Speaker 4>exhaustion.</v>

4274
01:56:40.171 --> 01:56:42.810
<v Speaker 4>That was kind of how I trained and I trained all the way through my career like</v>

4275
01:56:42.811 --> 01:56:43.380
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

4276
01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:44.880
<v Speaker 4>And the last couple of fights I've switched it up.</v>

4277
01:56:44.881 --> 01:56:47.820
<v Speaker 4>I be listening to a lot more like bite and more like blind binaural beat type of</v>

4278
01:56:47.821 --> 01:56:51.950
<v Speaker 4>stuff when I'm running so I could get into more like a meditative stage,</v>

4279
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.823
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4280
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:55.890
<v Speaker 4>doing a lot of yoga as well and trying to find the same thing where you just</v>

4281
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:59.340
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] you're within yourself and you're not focusing on anything else.</v>

4282
01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:01.380
<v Speaker 4>So your body's almost like on autopilot.</v>

4283
01:57:02.430 --> 01:57:03.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4284
01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:04.720
<v Speaker 4>That you,</v>

4285
01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:08.850
<v Speaker 4>the music that you listened to when you train can have a profound effect on how</v>

4286
01:57:08.851 --> 01:57:09.930
<v Speaker 4>you approach your training.</v>

4287
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:10.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4288
01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:11.213
<v Speaker 4>it really can.</v>

4289
01:57:11.340 --> 01:57:12.061
<v Speaker 4>It's so important.</v>

4290
01:57:12.061 --> 01:57:14.970
<v Speaker 4>And that's why I've always been so vocal about all the stuff I listened to.</v>

4291
01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:15.741
<v Speaker 4>Like I'd,</v>

4292
01:57:15.741 --> 01:57:16.890
<v Speaker 4>I'd like training camp playlist,</v>

4293
01:57:16.891 --> 01:57:20.160
<v Speaker 4>so I tweet everyday trunk songs I was listening to and that kind of thing.</v>

4294
01:57:20.780 --> 01:57:21.660
<v Speaker 4>It is important.</v>

4295
01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:21.871
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

4296
01:57:21.871 --> 01:57:22.071
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4297
01:57:22.071 --> 01:57:22.471
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>

4298
01:57:22.471 --> 01:57:23.131
<v Speaker 4>the other thing as well,</v>

4299
01:57:23.131 --> 01:57:24.180
<v Speaker 4>like earlier on in my career,</v>

4300
01:57:24.181 --> 01:57:26.160
<v Speaker 4>I would use music to anchor feelings.</v>

4301
01:57:26.730 --> 01:57:27.390
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

4302
01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:27.700
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4303
01:57:27.700 --> 01:57:28.020
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4304
01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:28.741
<v Speaker 4>when I fought Ludwick,</v>

4305
01:57:28.741 --> 01:57:30.540
<v Speaker 4>I used a song called ion by Woodkid,</v>

4306
01:57:31.170 --> 01:57:34.020
<v Speaker 4>which was the first time I'd switched it up from England belongs to me for like,</v>

4307
01:57:34.050 --> 01:57:34.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4308
01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:35.490
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of fires.</v>

4309
01:57:36.260 --> 01:57:37.093
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4310
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:39.390
<v Speaker 4>so like for the 12 weeks of that fight,</v>

4311
01:57:39.391 --> 01:57:40.500
<v Speaker 4>I was training with Frank Mir.</v>

4312
01:57:40.500 --> 01:57:41.333
<v Speaker 4>We were going up to read,</v>

4313
01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:44.670
<v Speaker 4>it's up to Mount Charleston and now into red rock and like doing hill running</v>

4314
01:57:44.671 --> 01:57:45.151
<v Speaker 4>and stuff.</v>

4315
01:57:45.151 --> 01:57:46.800
<v Speaker 4>And we had some real tough sessions.</v>

4316
01:57:46.801 --> 01:57:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4317
01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:47.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4318
01:57:47.530 --> 01:57:49.470
<v Speaker 4>we really put ourselves through it for that training camp.</v>

4319
01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:52.040
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as I got back in my truck after the second,</v>

4320
01:57:52.050 --> 01:57:52.711
<v Speaker 4>after the session,</v>

4321
01:57:52.711 --> 01:57:54.360
<v Speaker 4>if I felt like it was a good session,</v>

4322
01:57:54.361 --> 01:57:56.040
<v Speaker 4>it was productive and I felt positive,</v>

4323
01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:57.330
<v Speaker 4>I would put that song on.</v>

4324
01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:00.610
<v Speaker 4>And I would say I would constantly connect those feelings to that,</v>

4325
01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:01.473
<v Speaker 4>that song.</v>

4326
01:58:01.890 --> 01:58:02.550
<v Speaker 4>So then when,</v>

4327
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:04.140
<v Speaker 4>when I'm walking out and that song comes on,</v>

4328
01:58:04.170 --> 01:58:05.940
<v Speaker 4>immediately I get that feeling again.</v>

4329
01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:07.891
<v Speaker 4>And it's just like,</v>

4330
01:58:07.891 --> 01:58:08.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4331
01:58:08.131 --> 01:58:09.220
<v Speaker 4>just like when you listen to a song,</v>

4332
01:58:09.221 --> 01:58:10.860
<v Speaker 4>when you think of a person like,</v>

4333
01:58:10.890 --> 01:58:11.041
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4334
01:58:11.041 --> 01:58:13.320
<v Speaker 4>I heard that song person and you meet,</v>

4335
01:58:13.321 --> 01:58:14.520
<v Speaker 4>you make that connection immediately.</v>

4336
01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:16.440
<v Speaker 4>But you can also train yourself to do it.</v>

4337
01:58:17.210 --> 01:58:19.620
<v Speaker 4>So that's why you like Alison to Cypress Hill now.</v>

4338
01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:22.290
<v Speaker 4>And it'll take me back to fighting in cage warriors.</v>

4339
01:58:22.350 --> 01:58:22.770
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4340
01:58:22.770 --> 01:58:23.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4341
01:58:23.041 --> 01:58:25.200
<v Speaker 4>back in 2006 wow.</v>

4342
01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:28.830
<v Speaker 4>And I have songs all the way through like that and now I don't listen to,</v>

4343
01:58:28.831 --> 01:58:30.660
<v Speaker 4>cause it was like my first two fights.</v>

4344
01:58:30.661 --> 01:58:31.740
<v Speaker 4>I came out to Pantera,</v>

4345
01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:33.210
<v Speaker 4>dragged the waters.</v>

4346
01:58:33.450 --> 01:58:38.450
<v Speaker 4>By the time I got to the cage I was so wound up and so angry that I would just</v>

4347
01:58:39.151 --> 01:58:40.590
<v Speaker 4>add to run out of gas immediately.</v>

4348
01:58:42.190 --> 01:58:44.230
<v Speaker 4>And now whenever I listen to those songs,</v>

4349
01:58:44.231 --> 01:58:45.910
<v Speaker 4>I get that feeling of like exhaustion.</v>

4350
01:58:45.911 --> 01:58:46.130
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4351
01:58:46.130 --> 01:58:46.963
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

4352
01:58:47.850 --> 01:58:48.780
<v Speaker 4>that's hilarious.</v>

4353
01:58:48.781 --> 01:58:49.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4354
01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:50.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4355
01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:50.281
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4356
01:58:50.281 --> 01:58:51.720
<v Speaker 4>People have like sex songs.</v>

4357
01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:52.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4358
01:58:52.110 --> 01:58:52.570
<v Speaker 4>Remind them,</v>

4359
01:58:52.570 --> 01:58:55.690
<v Speaker 4>sex songs that remind you of disappointment songs.</v>

4360
01:58:55.691 --> 01:58:56.521
<v Speaker 4>Remind me of extra.</v>

4361
01:58:56.521 --> 01:58:58.230
<v Speaker 4>Why did you connect sex to disappointment?</v>

4362
01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:00.540
<v Speaker 4>Just standard,</v>

4363
01:59:00.541 --> 01:59:01.360
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>

4364
01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:02.130
<v Speaker 4>How it goes.</v>

4365
01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Most of the time we're just sex songs,</v>

4366
01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.600
<v Speaker 4>like something crazy on the spin doctor.</v>

4367
01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4368
01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:08.820
<v Speaker 4>so what's,</v>

4369
01:59:08.821 --> 01:59:09.061
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4370
01:59:09.061 --> 01:59:10.350
<v Speaker 4>what's next from here?</v>

4371
01:59:10.410 --> 01:59:11.000
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>

4372
01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:16.000
<v Speaker 4>your focus has moved slightly off of fighting and you still are interested in</v>

4373
01:59:16.171 --> 01:59:18.870
<v Speaker 4>fighting and you're still interested in seeing what sort of state you can</v>

4374
01:59:18.871 --> 01:59:20.990
<v Speaker 4>achieve inside the octagon.</v>

4375
01:59:21.170 --> 01:59:22.400
<v Speaker 4>What else are you going to do with your time?</v>

4376
01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:22.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4377
01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:23.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

4378
01:59:23.430 --> 01:59:24.740
<v Speaker 4>I've been having a lot of ideas.</v>

4379
01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:25.430
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4380
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:26.090
<v Speaker 4>a lot of,</v>

4381
01:59:26.090 --> 01:59:26.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4382
01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:29.410
<v Speaker 4>I've had a few ceremonies recently with various things and I've,</v>

4383
01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.273
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

4384
01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:33.320
<v Speaker 4>I've got quite a clear direction of where I want to go.</v>

4385
01:59:33.350 --> 01:59:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4386
01:59:33.770 --> 01:59:34.191
<v Speaker 4>I would like,</v>

4387
01:59:34.191 --> 01:59:35.230
<v Speaker 4>I want to get cleared to fight.</v>

4388
01:59:35.231 --> 01:59:36.530
<v Speaker 4>I would like to be able to fight again.</v>

4389
01:59:36.610 --> 01:59:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4390
01:59:36.980 --> 01:59:37.671
<v Speaker 4>even if it's just,</v>

4391
01:59:37.671 --> 01:59:37.851
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4392
01:59:37.851 --> 01:59:38.541
<v Speaker 4>once a year,</v>

4393
01:59:38.541 --> 01:59:40.850
<v Speaker 4>once every 18 months or something just and,</v>

4394
01:59:40.851 --> 01:59:43.400
<v Speaker 4>and just have a fight with like someone that's going to be a fun fight where I</v>

4395
01:59:43.401 --> 01:59:45.890
<v Speaker 4>can kind of test some of these theories and see where I'm at physically.</v>

4396
01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:47.053
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4397
01:59:47.660 --> 01:59:48.381
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to start,</v>

4398
01:59:48.381 --> 01:59:52.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to start a video blog in my training sessions because,</v>

4399
01:59:52.530 --> 01:59:53.363
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4400
01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:54.530
<v Speaker 4>I do all kinds of stuff.</v>

4401
01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:55.160
<v Speaker 4>I do a lot of,</v>

4402
01:59:55.160 --> 01:59:56.330
<v Speaker 4>a lot of big from Yoga,</v>

4403
01:59:56.331 --> 01:59:59.960
<v Speaker 4>a lot of hot yoga trail running kettlebells sessions.</v>

4404
02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:00.800
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4405
02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:04.220
<v Speaker 4>and then then I want to be able to go into the gym and work on specific things.</v>

4406
02:00:04.221 --> 02:00:04.471
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

4407
02:00:04.471 --> 02:00:09.290
<v Speaker 4>like last night I went in to a 10th planet Van Nuys and just kind of had a roll</v>

4408
02:00:09.291 --> 02:00:10.220
<v Speaker 4>around with those guys.</v>

4409
02:00:10.221 --> 02:00:12.100
<v Speaker 4>And I enjoyed it because cause there was,</v>

4410
02:00:12.140 --> 02:00:12.651
<v Speaker 4>it was very,</v>

4411
02:00:12.651 --> 02:00:13.251
<v Speaker 4>very playful.</v>

4412
02:00:13.251 --> 02:00:14.960
<v Speaker 4>There was no like agenda.</v>

4413
02:00:14.961 --> 02:00:16.490
<v Speaker 4>I had no agenda because I was just,</v>

4414
02:00:16.491 --> 02:00:17.360
<v Speaker 4>I was in the moment.</v>

4415
02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:18.920
<v Speaker 4>You're just learning and exactly.</v>

4416
02:00:19.070 --> 02:00:19.371
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

4417
02:00:19.371 --> 02:00:20.690
<v Speaker 4>and obviously when you've got to training camp,</v>

4418
02:00:20.691 --> 02:00:22.370
<v Speaker 4>everything's always like,</v>

4419
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.511
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

4420
02:00:22.511 --> 02:00:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I've always felt like I was wishing my life away because I'm constantly waiting</v>

4421
02:00:26.391 --> 02:00:27.380
<v Speaker 4>for a date that was five,</v>

4422
02:00:27.381 --> 02:00:28.490
<v Speaker 4>six weeks ahead.</v>

4423
02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:30.080
<v Speaker 4>So I'm never in the moment.</v>

4443
02:01:01.710 --> 02:01:03.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm not having it in an interesting direction,</v>

4468
02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:31.490
<v Speaker 4>and I'm just kind of interested to see where this journey is going to go.</v>

4469
02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:32.580
<v Speaker 4>My,</v>

4470

<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

4471
02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:33.471
<v Speaker 4>my goal is,</v>

4472
02:01:33.471 --> 02:01:35.660
<v Speaker 4>is to basically get paid to be myself.</v>

4473
02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:37.340
<v Speaker 4>That's what I want to do.</v>

4474
02:01:37.700 --> 02:01:38.001
<v Speaker 4>And do.</v>

4475
02:01:38.001 --> 02:01:38.720
<v Speaker 4>Improve yourself.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

4477
02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:40.520
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

4478
02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:40.800
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4479
02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:41.271
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4480
02:01:41.271 --> 02:01:41.721
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

4481
02:01:41.721 --> 02:01:42.554
<v Speaker 4>kind of,</v>

4482
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:43.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4483
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:44.170
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

4484
02:01:44.170 --> 02:01:45.920
<v Speaker 4>I have sponsors right now that a supportive,</v>

4485
02:01:45.921 --> 02:01:47.350
<v Speaker 4>obviously know what would zines and Fay,</v>

4486
02:01:47.351 --> 02:01:49.740
<v Speaker 4>the flights and venom and you know,</v>

4487
02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.140
<v Speaker 4>that I want them to,</v>

4488
02:01:51.141 --> 02:01:55.190
<v Speaker 4>to continue to support me and while I'm on this question and doing all this kind</v>

4489
02:01:55.191 --> 02:01:56.540
<v Speaker 4>of interesting stuff.</v>

4490
02:01:56.541 --> 02:01:59.450
<v Speaker 4>So I figured if I put a video blog out there for people to watch this,</v>

4491
02:01:59.480 --> 02:01:59.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4492
02:01:59.721 --> 02:02:00.410
<v Speaker 4>it gives them a,</v>

4493
02:02:00.410 --> 02:02:01.071
<v Speaker 4>that's a great idea.</v>

4494
02:02:01.071 --> 02:02:02.420
<v Speaker 4>I've been more of a connection Wolf camp.</v>

4495
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:03.283
<v Speaker 4>I think I can recall it.</v>

4496
02:02:03.890 --> 02:02:04.670
<v Speaker 4>The Wolfcamp fuck.</v>

4497
02:02:04.670 --> 02:02:05.420
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4498
02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:06.253
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4499
02:02:06.300 --> 02:02:07.133
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4500
02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:07.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4501
02:02:07.850 --> 02:02:08.740
<v Speaker 4>they're so worried.</v>

4502
02:02:09.850 --> 02:02:10.260
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

4503
02:02:10.260 --> 02:02:10.701
<v Speaker 4>so I think,</v>

4504
02:02:10.701 --> 02:02:11.660
<v Speaker 4>I think that's what I'm going to do.</v>

4505
02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:12.260
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4506
02:02:12.260 --> 02:02:13.880
<v Speaker 4>I have some other ideas as well.</v>

4507
02:02:13.970 --> 02:02:14.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4508
02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:15.081
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

4509
02:02:15.081 --> 02:02:15.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4510
02:02:15.860 --> 02:02:17.420

4511
02:02:17.421 --> 02:02:18.560
<v Speaker 4>some business ideas that are,</v>

4512
02:02:18.561 --> 02:02:19.820

4515
02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:22.620
<v Speaker 4>don't it on this podcast,</v>

4516
02:02:22.630 --> 02:02:24.070
<v Speaker 4>it's most definitely not illegal.</v>

4517
02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:25.223
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4518
02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:26.540
<v Speaker 4>at least not in Peru.</v>

4519
02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:28.150
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4520
02:02:28.150 --> 02:02:28.590
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

4521
02:02:28.590 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4522
02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:29.270
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4523
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:30.103
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4524
02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:33.920
<v Speaker 4>try and help promote a more clean and conscious lifestyle.</v>

4525
02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:35.840
<v Speaker 4>So what is your diet now?</v>

4526
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:37.730
<v Speaker 4>I'm predominantly Vegan now.</v>

4527
02:02:38.520 --> 02:02:39.353
<v Speaker 4>Bitch,</v>

4528
02:02:39.890 --> 02:02:40.790
<v Speaker 4>I thought we'd get into this.</v>

4529
02:02:40.791 --> 02:02:42.290
<v Speaker 4>I heard this call went dark.</v>

4530
02:02:42.291 --> 02:02:43.124
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4531
02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:43.980
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4532
02:02:43.980 --> 02:02:44.813
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

4533
02:02:45.080 --> 02:02:45.611
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

4534
02:02:45.611 --> 02:02:46.010
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4535
02:02:46.010 --> 02:02:47.450
<v Speaker 4>I'm not giving it a name because he's not,</v>

4536
02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:48.350
<v Speaker 4>not really got a name.</v>

4537
02:02:48.380 --> 02:02:49.213
<v Speaker 4>I'm just kind of,</v>

4538
02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:51.260
<v Speaker 4>my approach to animal products are,</v>

4539
02:02:51.261 --> 02:02:52.070
<v Speaker 4>I will,</v>

4540
02:02:52.070 --> 02:02:54.590
<v Speaker 4>I will have animal products occasionally if,</v>

4541
02:02:54.620 --> 02:02:57.650
<v Speaker 4>if I know that it's from a source that I'm uncomfortable with,</v>

4542
02:02:58.220 --> 02:02:59.053
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4543
02:02:59.300 --> 02:03:00.770
<v Speaker 4>like hunted meat or free range.</v>

4544
02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:01.191
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4545
02:03:01.191 --> 02:03:01.761
<v Speaker 4>Or something like that.</v>

4546
02:03:01.761 --> 02:03:02.440
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

4547
02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:02.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4548
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.790
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4549
02:03:03.790 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 4>I will eat fish all day long because fish don't even take care of the babies.</v>

4550
02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:08.900
<v Speaker 4>That's that.</v>

4551
02:03:08.900 --> 02:03:10.450
<v Speaker 4>That's my larger fish.</v>

4552
02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:11.930
<v Speaker 4>But anybody who doesn't eat fish,</v>

4553
02:03:11.931 --> 02:03:12.410
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>

4554
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:13.910
<v Speaker 4>But what about from a selfish point of view?</v>

4555
02:03:13.970 --> 02:03:16.010
<v Speaker 4>If you don't know where the fish is from?</v>

4556
02:03:16.011 --> 02:03:19.550
<v Speaker 4>Like if you went out to a restaurant and it was just farm raise is not good.</v>

4557
02:03:19.670 --> 02:03:21.890
<v Speaker 4>A lot of farm raised stuff is not good.</v>

4558
02:03:21.970 --> 02:03:22.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

4559
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:24.560
<v Speaker 4>because first of all,</v>

4560
02:03:24.710 --> 02:03:27.920
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times they're exposed to higher levels of mercury and apparently there</v>

4561
02:03:27.921 --> 02:03:29.870
<v Speaker 4>were higher levels of toxins.</v>

4562
02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:31.280
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you're in like,</v>

4563
02:03:31.281 --> 02:03:31.610
<v Speaker 4>Geez,</v>

4564
02:03:31.610 --> 02:03:34.980
<v Speaker 4>tanks of water or farms of all fish,</v>

4565
02:03:34.981 --> 02:03:36.710
<v Speaker 4>she's shitting on each other and it's just,</v>

4566
02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:38.870
<v Speaker 4>it's another healthy and tastes good.</v>

4567
02:03:39.260 --> 02:03:39.980
<v Speaker 4>It demeaning.</v>

4568
02:03:39.980 --> 02:03:40.161
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4569
02:03:40.161 --> 02:03:41.540
<v Speaker 4>it's better than not eat in it.</v>

4570
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:42.141
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4571
02:03:42.141 --> 02:03:42.980
<v Speaker 4>it's not that bad,</v>

4572
02:03:42.981 --> 02:03:45.200
<v Speaker 4>but I think that it's been proven that,</v>

4573
02:03:45.230 --> 02:03:45.620
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4574
02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:47.540
<v Speaker 4>that like when you see like red,</v>

4575
02:03:47.541 --> 02:03:51.080
<v Speaker 4>deep red salmon and then you see like the salmon that you get,</v>

4576
02:03:51.081 --> 02:03:53.690
<v Speaker 4>like this farm raised salmon where they have to dye it pink.</v>

4577
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:56.500
<v Speaker 4>It's been proven that that's wild stuff tastes better.</v>

4578
02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.320
<v Speaker 4>There's something better about it.</v>

4579
02:03:58.530 --> 02:03:59.480
<v Speaker 4>It's probably better for you.</v>

4580
02:03:59.510 --> 02:04:00.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's better for you,</v>

4581
02:04:00.441 --> 02:04:01.400
<v Speaker 4>but it's probably better for it.</v>

4582
02:04:01.401 --> 02:04:02.234
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4583
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4584
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:06.380
<v Speaker 4>I tweeted something to the day I was in a store in Boise,</v>

4585
02:04:06.381 --> 02:04:07.960
<v Speaker 4>Idaho and uh,</v>

4586
02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:08.301
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

4587
02:04:08.301 --> 02:04:08.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4588
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:13.990
<v Speaker 4>it was a photograph of the ingredients of a bottle of soda and one of the</v>

4589
02:04:14.631 --> 02:04:17.090
<v Speaker 4>Ingredients with artificial wild cherries.</v>

4590
02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:23.060
<v Speaker 4>That's hilarious.</v>

4591
02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:24.080
<v Speaker 4>So come to America,</v>

4592
02:04:24.110 --> 02:04:25.670
<v Speaker 4>Monsanto probably owns the patent on it.</v>

4593
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:28.480
<v Speaker 4>So we were talking about this and,</v>

4594
02:04:28.481 --> 02:04:29.200
<v Speaker 4>and I got into it,</v>

4595
02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:30.200
<v Speaker 4>my theory of a,</v>

4596
02:04:30.210 --> 02:04:31.850
<v Speaker 4>of of stoner language,</v>

4597
02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.740
<v Speaker 4>the style like stoner understandings of the world,</v>

4598
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:36.320
<v Speaker 4>things that you see if you smoke weed,</v>

4599
02:04:36.321 --> 02:04:37.840
<v Speaker 4>the other people that weed don't.</v>

4600
02:04:38.290 --> 02:04:39.570
<v Speaker 4>And that's that kind of thing.</v>

4601
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:41.400
<v Speaker 4>Artificial Wild Cherries.</v>

4602
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:42.263
<v Speaker 4>Wow,</v>

4603
02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:43.253
<v Speaker 4>that's sweet.</v>

4604
02:04:43.570 --> 02:04:44.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4605
02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:45.740
<v Speaker 4>it's hilarious.</v>

4606
02:04:45.740 --> 02:04:46.740
<v Speaker 4>And it's really funny,</v>

4607
02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:47.460
<v Speaker 4>like people,</v>

4608
02:04:47.460 --> 02:04:48.293
<v Speaker 4>people that don't</v>

4609
02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:51.690
<v Speaker 4>use plants in various ways,</v>

4610
02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:52.350
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

4611
02:04:52.350 --> 02:04:53.520
<v Speaker 4>don't see these things.</v>

4612
02:04:53.521 --> 02:04:53.880
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

4613
02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:56.430
<v Speaker 4>they don't pick up on these artificial wild cherries.</v>

4614
02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.220
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4615
02:04:57.220 --> 02:04:57.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4616
02:04:57.781 --> 02:04:58.201
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a,</v>

4617
02:04:58.201 --> 02:05:03.090
<v Speaker 4>I'm not 100% proponent of all people using marijuana because I know some people</v>

4618
02:05:03.091 --> 02:05:03.690
<v Speaker 4>can't.</v>

4619
02:05:03.690 --> 02:05:03.901
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4620
02:05:03.901 --> 02:05:04.260
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4621
02:05:04.260 --> 02:05:05.093
<v Speaker 4>I know they can't,</v>

4622
02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:05.761
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

4623
02:05:05.761 --> 02:05:07.260
<v Speaker 4>when you hear somebody say something like that,</v>

4624
02:05:07.261 --> 02:05:07.531
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

4625
02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:07.661
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4626
02:05:07.661 --> 02:05:08.510
<v Speaker 4>that was a stoner.</v>

4627
02:05:09.030 --> 02:05:09.863
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4628
02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:12.990
<v Speaker 4>There's certain things that people say where you automatically know this guy</v>

4629
02:05:12.991 --> 02:05:13.570
<v Speaker 4>gets high.</v>

4630
02:05:13.570 --> 02:05:14.390
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4631
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:15.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4632
02:05:15.160 --> 02:05:17.460
<v Speaker 4>they get high and they don't get high like Stan Hope.</v>

4633
02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:18.241
<v Speaker 4>Thanks Dan.</v>

4634
02:05:18.241 --> 02:05:20.040
<v Speaker 4>Hope totally seems like you would get high,</v>

4635
02:05:20.041 --> 02:05:20.880
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't get hot.</v>

4636
02:05:21.210 --> 02:05:22.080
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't like it.</v>

4637
02:05:22.290 --> 02:05:22.590
<v Speaker 4>It says,</v>

4638
02:05:22.590 --> 02:05:23.600
<v Speaker 4>it makes him feel paranoid.</v>

4639
02:05:23.650 --> 02:05:24.690
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't like it at all.</v>

4640
02:05:24.830 --> 02:05:27.360
<v Speaker 4>It's maybe some people that just naturally inclined to be like that.</v>

4641
02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:29.130
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't tell.</v>

4642
02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:29.641
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4643
02:05:29.641 --> 02:05:34.641
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's obvious when you look at terrible people that someone's brain</v>

4644
02:05:35.401 --> 02:05:37.170
<v Speaker 4>works different than your brain or my brain.</v>

4645
02:05:37.230 --> 02:05:37.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4646
02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:40.530
<v Speaker 4>And when you see like a guy like Gandhi,</v>

4647
02:05:40.630 --> 02:05:41.431
<v Speaker 4>for sure,</v>

4648
02:05:41.431 --> 02:05:43.350
<v Speaker 4>his brain works different than my brain.</v>

4649
02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:44.880
<v Speaker 4>There's just no doubt about it.</v>

4650
02:05:44.910 --> 02:05:48.450
<v Speaker 4>He also had his own path and he also had his own intentions and his own life.</v>

4651
02:05:48.810 --> 02:05:53.160
<v Speaker 4>But I just can't imagine that his interpretation of life was the same as my</v>

4652
02:05:53.161 --> 02:05:54.210
<v Speaker 4>interpretation of life.</v>

4653
02:05:54.570 --> 02:05:55.620
<v Speaker 4>And if that's the case,</v>

4654
02:05:55.890 --> 02:05:58.380
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck do I know what pot does to you?</v>

4655
02:05:58.710 --> 02:05:59.790
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck would I know?</v>

4656
02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:00.630
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

4657
02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:01.463
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4658
02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:03.120
<v Speaker 4>I know people can't smoke it.</v>

4659
02:06:03.121 --> 02:06:06.600
<v Speaker 4>They smoke it and then they'll wake up three days later with their pants off in</v>

4660
02:06:06.601 --> 02:06:07.434
<v Speaker 4>the jungle.</v>

4661
02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:07.830
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4662
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:08.100
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4663
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:08.810
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

4664
02:06:08.810 --> 02:06:09.643
<v Speaker 4>like a good weekend</v>

4665
02:06:11.370 --> 02:06:13.410
<v Speaker 4>unless one of those wandering spiders.</v>

4666
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:14.420
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>

4667
02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:15.780
<v Speaker 4>It gives you a hard on until you die.</v>

4668
02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:16.591
<v Speaker 4>I spent two weeks,</v>

4669
02:06:16.591 --> 02:06:17.850
<v Speaker 4>we'll come around the juggling my underwear.</v>

4670
02:06:17.880 --> 02:06:18.713
<v Speaker 4>How dare you sir.</v>

4671
02:06:19.150 --> 02:06:19.983
<v Speaker 4>You get nervous.</v>

4672
02:06:20.180 --> 02:06:20.640
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4673
02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:21.130
<v Speaker 4>nothing bite.</v>

4674
02:06:21.130 --> 02:06:21.931
<v Speaker 4>And you know nothing.</v>

4675
02:06:21.931 --> 02:06:24.540
<v Speaker 4>You feel like you had the secret on your sides and you're putting out positive</v>

4676
02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:25.170
<v Speaker 4>vibes.</v>

4677
02:06:25.170 --> 02:06:26.250
<v Speaker 4>I was very connected to it.</v>

4678
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:29.550
<v Speaker 4>Like I wasn't going to mess with everything and they weren't gonna mess with me.</v>

4679
02:06:29.551 --> 02:06:29.940
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

4680
02:06:29.940 --> 02:06:30.480
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

4681
02:06:30.480 --> 02:06:33.030
<v Speaker 4>Did you see Jaguars and you're ill could hit?</v>

4682
02:06:33.031 --> 02:06:33.480
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4683
02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.320
<v Speaker 4>We could hear him though.</v>

4684
02:06:34.321 --> 02:06:34.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4685
02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:37.320
<v Speaker 4>Because the jungle was literally like outside of this dude,</v>

4686
02:06:37.321 --> 02:06:37.920
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute.</v>

4687
02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.090
<v Speaker 4>So you're on Ios.</v>

4688
02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:40.740
<v Speaker 4>Can you hear Jaguars?</v>

4689
02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:42.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4690
02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:45.500
<v Speaker 4>you could just have them find me.</v>

4691
02:06:46.590 --> 02:06:49.200
<v Speaker 4>Just come into contact with each other and so on.</v>

4692
02:06:49.230 --> 02:06:50.790
<v Speaker 4>Does that make you shit your pants?</v>

4693
02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:53.460
<v Speaker 4>Not as much as the plane going over.</v>

4694
02:06:53.461 --> 02:06:54.420
<v Speaker 4>That was really scary.</v>

4695
02:06:54.450 --> 02:06:54.601
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

4696

4697
02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:58.860

4698
02:06:58.890 --> 02:07:02.310

4703

<v Speaker 4>There's not much separating you and there's all kinds of noises and crazy stuff</v>

4712
02:07:21.361 --> 02:07:24.630
<v Speaker 4>going on and it just kind of becomes comfortable after a while.</v>

4713
02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:25.770
<v Speaker 4>But bugs are really loud,</v>

4714
02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:26.070
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4715
02:07:26.070 --> 02:07:26.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4716
02:07:26.311 --> 02:07:26.671
<v Speaker 4>they are.</v>

4717
02:07:26.671 --> 02:07:27.750
<v Speaker 4>And the frogs as well.</v>

4718
02:07:28.170 --> 02:07:32.040
<v Speaker 4>But the plane was such an such an alien kind of sound because we only heard it a</v>

4719
02:07:32.041 --> 02:07:34.080
<v Speaker 4>couple of times a day and the,</v>

4720
02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:34.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4721
02:07:34.381 --> 02:07:36.040
<v Speaker 4>the last time heard it was eight 30 at</v>

4722
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:37.570
<v Speaker 6>night just after without the other,</v>

4723
02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:38.021
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4724
02:07:38.021 --> 02:07:41.170
<v Speaker 6>the dose of Iowaska and it started to come on and the next thing I can hear it</v>

4725
02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:44.110
<v Speaker 6>over my head and um,</v>

4726
02:07:44.170 --> 02:07:46.780
<v Speaker 6>and I can feel everybody else's consciousness on that plane.</v>

4727
02:07:46.781 --> 02:07:47.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

4728
02:07:47.110 --> 02:07:47.921
<v Speaker 6>I know there are like,</v>

4729
02:07:47.921 --> 02:07:48.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4730
02:07:48.490 --> 02:07:52.720
<v Speaker 6>like 250 people up there and I'm like feeling all of that kind of energy go</v>

4731
02:07:52.721 --> 02:07:52.871
<v Speaker 6>over.</v>

4732
02:07:52.871 --> 02:07:55.360
<v Speaker 6>It was really weird and it happened every night.</v>

4733
02:07:55.361 --> 02:07:56.090
<v Speaker 6>Every ceremony</v>

4734
02:07:56.090 --> 02:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>in those third world plane flights,</v>

4735
02:07:58.600 --> 02:07:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Dems a little different.</v>

4736
02:07:59.631 --> 02:08:00.980
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

4737
02:08:01.160 --> 02:08:05.120
<v Speaker 1>that was the chicken's in the back down with fucking duct tape.</v>

4738
02:08:05.160 --> 02:08:07.680
<v Speaker 6>You saw that plane crash that happened and I picked that,</v>

4739
02:08:07.681 --> 02:08:08.514
<v Speaker 6>freaked me.</v>

4740
02:08:08.650 --> 02:08:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Did you see that from Afghanistan?</v>

4741
02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:13.480
<v Speaker 1>It was a cargo plane and they think that the cargo shifted,</v>

4742
02:08:13.481 --> 02:08:14.530
<v Speaker 1>the load shifted,</v>

4743
02:08:14.710 --> 02:08:16.270
<v Speaker 1>like it wasn't tied down properly.</v>

4744
02:08:17.170 --> 02:08:18.100
<v Speaker 1>And when that happens,</v>

4745
02:08:18.101 --> 02:08:20.470
<v Speaker 1>if the load shifts the plane just immediately,</v>

4746
02:08:20.471 --> 02:08:23.220
<v Speaker 1>all the weight goes to the front or the back of the plane and they just nose</v>

4747
02:08:23.221 --> 02:08:23.591
<v Speaker 1>dive.</v>

4748
02:08:23.591 --> 02:08:24.424
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4749
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

4750
02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4751
02:08:25.630 --> 02:08:26.530
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty fucked up.</v>

4752
02:08:26.531 --> 02:08:28.270
<v Speaker 1>We'll end on that for a nice,</v>

4753
02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:29.201
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

4754
02:08:29.201 --> 02:08:32.140
<v Speaker 1>cheery way to end just to,</v>

4755
02:08:32.170 --> 02:08:34.840
<v Speaker 1>just to let everybody know that you could,</v>

4756
02:08:34.900 --> 02:08:38.290
<v Speaker 1>you could defy gravity for short periods of time every now and again.</v>

4757
02:08:39.130 --> 02:08:44.130
<v Speaker 1>But if you fuck up then or it fucks up or this mechanical failure or Jesus</v>

4758
02:08:48.010 --> 02:08:48.011
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

4759
02:08:48.011 --> 02:08:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Imagine watching that.</v>

4760
02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:53.693
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4761
02:08:54.110 --> 02:08:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I just being on that bus,</v>

4762
02:08:55.181 --> 02:08:56.014
<v Speaker 1>driving past it.</v>

4763
02:08:56.140 --> 02:08:56.973
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

4764
02:08:56.980 --> 02:09:00.820
<v Speaker 1>that bus almost got hit by a plane that fell from the sky.</v>

4765
02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:01.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4766
02:09:01.820 --> 02:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>that's like a scene,</v>

4767
02:09:02.940 --> 02:09:04.090
<v Speaker 1>a final destination.</v>

4768
02:09:04.091 --> 02:09:09.091
<v Speaker 1>16 or something one day when we have magnetic UFO looking things that can't even</v>

4769
02:09:11.321 --> 02:09:13.600
<v Speaker 1>run into each other cause they have magnets on the outside.</v>

4770
02:09:13.601 --> 02:09:14.434
<v Speaker 1>So they go like this.</v>

4771
02:09:15.010 --> 02:09:16.150
<v Speaker 1>When they bounce off each other,</v>

4772
02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:18.100
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at,</v>

4773
02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:19.330
<v Speaker 1>someone should get on crashes.</v>

4774
02:09:19.450 --> 02:09:20.580
<v Speaker 1>I think they're probably already on it,</v>

4775
02:09:20.581 --> 02:09:21.250
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

4776
02:09:21.250 --> 02:09:22.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4777
02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:23.171
<v Speaker 1>Well they always talk about,</v>

4778
02:09:23.171 --> 02:09:23.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4779
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:24.281
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

4780
02:09:24.281 --> 02:09:29.281
<v Speaker 1>whenever like serious physicist discuss the possibility of space travel,</v>

4781
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:30.730
<v Speaker 1>like interstellar space travel.</v>

4782
02:09:31.150 --> 02:09:31.481
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

4783
02:09:31.481 --> 02:09:32.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Stanton Freedman.</v>

4784
02:09:32.681 --> 02:09:33.171
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>

4785
02:09:33.171 --> 02:09:34.360
<v Speaker 1>how could aliens be doing it?</v>

4786
02:09:34.570 --> 02:09:37.240
<v Speaker 1>One of the things they always concentrate on some sort of magnetic drive.</v>

4787
02:09:37.450 --> 02:09:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

4788
02:09:38.050 --> 02:09:38.883
<v Speaker 1>The um,</v>

4789
02:09:39.190 --> 02:09:40.210
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

4790
02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:40.840
<v Speaker 1>guide,</v>

4791
02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Dr Robert Lasar,</v>

4792
02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>he's a often criticized gentlemen who claimed to work at area 51.</v>

4793
02:09:48.190 --> 02:09:50.170
<v Speaker 1>But whether or not that got told the truth,</v>

4794
02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

4795
02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:51.670
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

4796
02:09:51.670 --> 02:09:55.750
<v Speaker 1>he described and some sort of back engineering that they were doing at area 51.</v>

4797
02:09:55.751 --> 02:09:57.340
<v Speaker 1>And it was some sort of magnetic drive.</v>

4798
02:09:58.080 --> 02:09:58.870
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that,</v>

4799
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:59.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4800
02:09:59.111 --> 02:09:59.944
<v Speaker 1>you figure out how to,</v>

4801
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:02.080
<v Speaker 1>he's magnets or something to overcome,</v>

4802
02:10:02.081 --> 02:10:07.081
<v Speaker 1>gravitating to create like a little hole in space and time and then just fly</v>

4803
02:10:07.511 --> 02:10:08.344
<v Speaker 1>around through that.</v>

4804
02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck I even said Dan Hardee,</v>

4805
02:10:11.201 --> 02:10:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't even mind.</v>

4806
02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:13.001
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't,</v>

4807
02:10:13.001 --> 02:10:16.330
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be legal for me to say what I just said because I don't even know</v>

4808
02:10:16.331 --> 02:10:17.164
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck it means.</v>

4809
02:10:18.340 --> 02:10:18.790
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

4810
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:20.440
<v Speaker 6>I got ready into aliens when I was younger.</v>

4811
02:10:20.590 --> 02:10:21.460
<v Speaker 6>When I was in my teens.</v>

4812
02:10:21.461 --> 02:10:22.750
<v Speaker 6>It was like everything was aliens.</v>

4813
02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:26.830
<v Speaker 6>I really hope I got to experience some kind of contact before I die.</v>

4814
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you see this latest disclosure,</v>

4815
02:10:28.931 --> 02:10:32.710
<v Speaker 1>these five days of a disclosure hearings on Capitol Hill?</v>

4816
02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:33.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4817
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:34.243
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4818
02:10:34.370 --> 02:10:34.671
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

4819
02:10:34.671 --> 02:10:35.510
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit.</v>

4820
02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:36.411
<v Speaker 1>All of these different,</v>

4821
02:10:36.411 --> 02:10:36.801
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4822
02:10:36.801 --> 02:10:41.801
<v Speaker 1>Well you know the real problem with any sort of Ufo thing is that it looks</v>

4823
02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:42.620
<v Speaker 1>silly.</v>

4824
02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:43.251
<v Speaker 1>It looks silly.</v>

4825
02:10:43.251 --> 02:10:46.030
<v Speaker 1>You saying you saw a Ufo makes you a silly person,</v>

4826
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:51.250
<v Speaker 1>more silly even than Iowasca cause at least Iowasca has a great body of evidence</v>

4827
02:10:51.951 --> 02:10:53.270
<v Speaker 1>to support what's going on.</v>

4828
02:10:53.271 --> 02:10:55.850
<v Speaker 1>You know chemically what you're saying that you saw a Ufo,</v>

4829
02:10:55.851 --> 02:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>you immediately become a silly person.</v>

4830
02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:00.950
<v Speaker 1>All these like former military people,</v>

4831
02:11:00.951 --> 02:11:03.350
<v Speaker 1>all these people that were air traffic controllers,</v>

4832
02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:04.633
<v Speaker 1>pilots,</v>

4833
02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:08.240
<v Speaker 1>all these people report these unbelievably unique experiences.</v>

4834
02:11:08.590 --> 02:11:10.010
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know if they're telling the truth or not,</v>

4835
02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:11.450
<v Speaker 1>but if they were telling the truth,</v>

4836
02:11:11.451 --> 02:11:15.050
<v Speaker 1>if just one of these things happened every now and again,</v>

4837
02:11:15.110 --> 02:11:18.020
<v Speaker 1>of course it would seem ridiculous to us on the outside,</v>

4838
02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:19.520
<v Speaker 1>the people sitting down here,</v>

4839
02:11:19.521 --> 02:11:20.120
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4840
02:11:20.120 --> 02:11:24.350
<v Speaker 1>it's natural to criticize it and make fun of it and laugh at it because it is</v>

4841
02:11:24.351 --> 02:11:25.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of crazy to think,</v>

4842
02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:27.650
<v Speaker 1>but if just one of those is true,</v>

4843
02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:32.180
<v Speaker 1>if just one of those are a real craft from another dimension from another</v>

4844
02:11:32.181 --> 02:11:33.014
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

4845
02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you don't think that that's possible.</v>

4846
02:11:35.140 --> 02:11:36.260
<v Speaker 1>You are silly.</v>

4847
02:11:36.590 --> 02:11:39.200
<v Speaker 1>If you don't think that within from here,</v>

4848
02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:40.670
<v Speaker 1>in every direction,</v>

4849
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:42.260
<v Speaker 1>infinite space,</v>

4850
02:11:42.690 --> 02:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

4851
02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:43.791
<v Speaker 1>What does that even mean?</v>

4852
02:11:43.791 --> 02:11:45.080
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what the fuck that means.</v>

4853
02:11:45.210 --> 02:11:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I can't even comprehend that.</v>

4854
02:11:46.081 --> 02:11:48.000
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be something out that it's,</v>

4855
02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:51.110
<v Speaker 1>I think if we survive,</v>

4856
02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:55.610
<v Speaker 1>if we little pesky humans figured out how to keep going for another couple of</v>

4857
02:11:55.610 --> 02:11:55.640
<v Speaker 1>million years,</v>

4858
02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:59.570
<v Speaker 1>who knows what the fuck we're going to figure out to think that somebody else</v>

4859
02:11:59.571 --> 02:12:00.410
<v Speaker 1>can't be out there.</v>

4860
02:12:00.860 --> 02:12:02.420
<v Speaker 1>And what would we do if someone was out there?</v>

4861
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:03.380
<v Speaker 1>We would go check them out.</v>

4862
02:12:03.410 --> 02:12:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4863
02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:04.170
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

4864
02:12:04.170 --> 02:12:04.701
<v Speaker 1>Of course it.</v>

4865
02:12:04.701 --> 02:12:05.121
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

4866
02:12:05.121 --> 02:12:05.930
<v Speaker 1>we check them out.</v>

4867
02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:06.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4868
02:12:06.380 --> 02:12:07.490
<v Speaker 1>We go to the Congo,</v>

4869
02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:08.781
<v Speaker 1>we go to the Congo,</v>

4870
02:12:08.781 --> 02:12:09.710
<v Speaker 1>we check out tribes,</v>

4871
02:12:09.711 --> 02:12:11.030
<v Speaker 1>we check out tribes of fishermen.</v>

4872
02:12:11.031 --> 02:12:12.350
<v Speaker 1>They're hanging off fucking trees,</v>

4873
02:12:12.351 --> 02:12:13.610
<v Speaker 1>picking up fish with nets.</v>

4874
02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:14.960
<v Speaker 1>We'd go watch him.</v>

4875
02:12:15.150 --> 02:12:16.520
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about the theory of,</v>

4876
02:12:16.521 --> 02:12:17.061
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

4877
02:12:17.061 --> 02:12:17.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4878
02:12:17.710 --> 02:12:17.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4879
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:18.141
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4880
02:12:18.141 --> 02:12:18.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4881
02:12:18.300 --> 02:12:19.970
<v Speaker 1>the interaction without a history and how,</v>

4882
02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and how they've helped guide us.</v>

4883
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:23.450
<v Speaker 1>It's all speculation.</v>

4884
02:12:23.570 --> 02:12:24.950
<v Speaker 1>It's complete speculation,</v>

4885
02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but cause you don't know whether or not you look at an ancient,</v>

4886
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:28.540
<v Speaker 1>when you look at ancient drawings,</v>

4887
02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:29.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's fantasy.</v>

4888
02:12:29.631 --> 02:12:30.830
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what's a story.</v>

4889
02:12:31.070 --> 02:12:34.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what's their version of a fucking,</v>

4890
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:35.720
<v Speaker 1>the Hobbit,</v>

4891
02:12:35.950 --> 02:12:36.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4892
02:12:36.171 --> 02:12:37.340
<v Speaker 1>they might make up stories.</v>

4893
02:12:37.341 --> 02:12:40.280
<v Speaker 1>You know who else it could be their version of twilight.</v>

4894
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:40.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

4895
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:41.533
<v Speaker 1>when you look at it,</v>

4896
02:12:41.750 --> 02:12:42.950
<v Speaker 1>it aliens in the wall.</v>

4897
02:12:42.951 --> 02:12:43.761
<v Speaker 1>It's their version.</v>

4898
02:12:43.761 --> 02:12:46.190
<v Speaker 1>Like they told a stupid story to make everybody go to sleep.</v>

4899
02:12:46.210 --> 02:12:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4900
02:12:46.490 --> 02:12:47.323
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

4901
02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:48.740
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's art.</v>

4902
02:12:48.741 --> 02:12:49.031
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

4903
02:12:49.031 --> 02:12:49.221
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

4904
02:12:49.221 --> 02:12:50.180
<v Speaker 1>we've seen in,</v>

4905
02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:53.750
<v Speaker 1>in their art these depictions that closely resemble what we would think to be</v>

4906
02:12:54.080 --> 02:12:54.411
<v Speaker 1>alien.</v>

4907
02:12:54.411 --> 02:12:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Spacecrafts are alien beings,</v>

4908
02:12:55.821 --> 02:12:57.140
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really know what the fuck it is.</v>

4909
02:12:57.141 --> 02:12:58.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not that much evidence.</v>

4910
02:12:58.550 --> 02:12:59.870
<v Speaker 1>So small amount of evidence.</v>

4911
02:13:00.290 --> 02:13:01.580
<v Speaker 1>There's a few cool videos,</v>

4912
02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:02.330
<v Speaker 1>you know that like,</v>

4913
02:13:02.330 --> 02:13:02.571
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

4914
02:13:02.571 --> 02:13:03.200
<v Speaker 1>what is that?</v>

4915
02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh the fuck that is,</v>

4916
02:13:04.030 --> 02:13:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if it's real.</v>

4917
02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:06.313
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to tell.</v>

4918
02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:07.071
<v Speaker 1>But if it happened to you,</v>

4919
02:13:07.071 --> 02:13:07.281
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4920
02:13:07.281 --> 02:13:08.330
<v Speaker 1>you'd fucking know.</v>

4921
02:13:08.810 --> 02:13:10.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you can't discount.</v>

4922
02:13:10.040 --> 02:13:12.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't discount the possibility of unique experience.</v>

4923
02:13:14.690 --> 02:13:16.550
<v Speaker 1>But once you've had a DMT trip,</v>

4924
02:13:16.551 --> 02:13:18.560
<v Speaker 1>aliens seem like so passe.</v>

4925
02:13:19.610 --> 02:13:20.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

4926
02:13:20.210 --> 02:13:21.650
<v Speaker 1>it's just kind of matter of fact,</v>

4927
02:13:22.050 --> 02:13:23.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it is kind of like,</v>

4928
02:13:23.031 --> 02:13:23.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

4929
02:13:23.211 --> 02:13:23.361
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4930
02:13:23.361 --> 02:13:23.930
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

4931
02:13:23.930 --> 02:13:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Well not only that,</v>

4932
02:13:24.771 --> 02:13:27.740
<v Speaker 1>it's like to have that experience like a,</v>

4933
02:13:27.741 --> 02:13:29.870
<v Speaker 1>a ship lands and they get out.</v>

4934
02:13:29.871 --> 02:13:31.530
<v Speaker 1>It would be so less bizarre.</v>

4935
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4936
02:13:31.760 --> 02:13:33.570
<v Speaker 1>because it's all taking place right here.</v>

4937
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:34.860
<v Speaker 1>You can say it's external.</v>

4938
02:13:34.890 --> 02:13:35.701
<v Speaker 1>What's taking place.</v>

4939
02:13:35.701 --> 02:13:37.860
<v Speaker 1>Also in the dimension that we're comfortable with,</v>

4940
02:13:38.070 --> 02:13:41.520
<v Speaker 1>where we can walk on the grass and feel the grass where we step on rocks.</v>

4941
02:13:41.521 --> 02:13:42.930
<v Speaker 1>We feel the rocks and our shoe.</v>

4942
02:13:43.050 --> 02:13:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Your car's parked over there,</v>

4943
02:13:44.611 --> 02:13:48.240
<v Speaker 1>you see the clouds above you and then everything is basically normal except this</v>

4944
02:13:48.241 --> 02:13:51.390
<v Speaker 1>new introduced element into your environment you have now except,</v>

4945
02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:51.851
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

4946
02:13:51.851 --> 02:13:54.690
<v Speaker 1>it was a fucking little dude from another planet.</v>

4947
02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:55.441
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

4948
02:13:55.441 --> 02:13:56.340
<v Speaker 1>This really is true.</v>

4949
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:59.760
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing compared to a DMT trip cause a DMT trip.</v>

4950
02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:03.810
<v Speaker 1>The dimension that you exist in becomes of a vibrant,</v>

4951
02:14:03.811 --> 02:14:08.400
<v Speaker 1>glowing colors with no background and constantly changing geometric patterns</v>

4952
02:14:08.401 --> 02:14:10.350
<v Speaker 1>that are there fractal and their infinite.</v>

4953
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:12.540
<v Speaker 1>That's way crazier than an alien landing.</v>

4954
02:14:12.570 --> 02:14:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4955
02:14:13.150 --> 02:14:15.960
<v Speaker 6>The thing is like where we're in an environment now where particularly with the</v>

4956
02:14:15.961 --> 02:14:16.381
<v Speaker 6>Internet,</v>

4957
02:14:16.381 --> 02:14:17.190
<v Speaker 6>we,</v>

4958
02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:19.380
<v Speaker 6>we've effectively seen most things.</v>

4959
02:14:19.381 --> 02:14:19.531
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4960
02:14:19.531 --> 02:14:22.590
<v Speaker 6>I remember when I was in China and I was walking down the street with a friend</v>

4961
02:14:22.591 --> 02:14:23.430
<v Speaker 6>of mine who was like,</v>

4962
02:14:23.450 --> 02:14:23.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4963
02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:28.880
<v Speaker 6>230 pound red black dude and these Chinese dudes would just ignore it.</v>

4964
02:14:30.091 --> 02:14:30.390
<v Speaker 6>They just,</v>

4965
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:31.071
<v Speaker 6>they just stood,</v>

4966
02:14:31.071 --> 02:14:32.790
<v Speaker 6>stood and watched him as he walked down the street.</v>

4967
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:33.930
<v Speaker 6>Like the Green Mile.</v>

4968
02:14:33.990 --> 02:14:34.621
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

4969
02:14:34.621 --> 02:14:35.430
<v Speaker 6>So then you know,</v>

4970
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.820
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4971
02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:37.500
<v Speaker 6>and then think back to like a,</v>

4972
02:14:37.890 --> 02:14:38.723
<v Speaker 6>I dunno,</v>

4973
02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:39.961
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4974
02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:40.090
<v Speaker 6>when,</v>

4975
02:14:40.090 --> 02:14:43.110
<v Speaker 6>when when the Romans were fighting different tribes and they were taking</v>

4976
02:14:43.111 --> 02:14:43.950
<v Speaker 6>elephants with them.</v>

4977
02:14:43.951 --> 02:14:45.570
<v Speaker 6>Like when they took the elephants to Britannia,</v>

4978
02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:46.081
<v Speaker 6>like there's a,</v>

4979
02:14:46.081 --> 02:14:46.410
<v Speaker 6>there's a,</v>

4980
02:14:46.410 --> 02:14:48.870
<v Speaker 6>there's a tube station in London called elephant and castle,</v>

4981
02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:49.700
<v Speaker 6>which was,</v>

4982
02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:50.010
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4983
02:14:50.010 --> 02:14:51.420
<v Speaker 6>this elephant crossing,</v>

4984
02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:56.460
<v Speaker 6>crossing this plane with this dude sitting on top riding in it and the Bob</v>

4985
02:14:56.461 --> 02:14:59.520
<v Speaker 6>errands that were living there at the time just lost their shit and ran away.</v>

4986
02:14:59.730 --> 02:14:59.971
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4987
02:14:59.971 --> 02:15:00.631
<v Speaker 6>why wouldn't you,</v>

4988
02:15:00.631 --> 02:15:01.464
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

4989
02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:04.620
<v Speaker 6>But we don't have those experiences anymore because we've seen everything.</v>

4990
02:15:04.621 --> 02:15:05.131
<v Speaker 6>Or you know,</v>

4991
02:15:05.131 --> 02:15:06.220
<v Speaker 6>we might see something that's a,</v>

4992
02:15:06.660 --> 02:15:07.411
<v Speaker 6>a new species,</v>

4993
02:15:07.411 --> 02:15:10.020
<v Speaker 6>but it's only a variation of something that's already familiar to us.</v>

4994
02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:10.591
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4995
02:15:10.591 --> 02:15:12.330
<v Speaker 6>imagine seeing an elephant for the first time.</v>

4996
02:15:12.331 --> 02:15:13.620
<v Speaker 6>If you've lived in like,</v>

4997
02:15:14.250 --> 02:15:14.491
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

4998
02:15:14.491 --> 02:15:15.324
<v Speaker 6>England,</v>

4999
02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:16.343
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ,</v>

5000
02:15:16.350 --> 02:15:17.340
<v Speaker 6>it would blow your mind.</v>

5001
02:15:17.670 --> 02:15:19.500
<v Speaker 4>When did they know that elephants existed?</v>

5002
02:15:19.501 --> 02:15:22.110
<v Speaker 4>When was the first documented by Western world?</v>

5003
02:15:22.140 --> 02:15:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Obviously Africans,</v>

5004
02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5005
02:15:24.570 --> 02:15:25.051
<v Speaker 4>listen to this,</v>

5006
02:15:25.051 --> 02:15:25.884
<v Speaker 4>go bitch.</v>

5007
02:15:26.040 --> 02:15:26.871
<v Speaker 4>We've known about it.</v>

5008
02:15:26.871 --> 02:15:29.010
<v Speaker 4>I'll find it for 70,000 years.</v>

5009
02:15:30.030 --> 02:15:31.320
<v Speaker 4>When did you figure it out?</v>

5010
02:15:31.321 --> 02:15:32.154
<v Speaker 4>At a fun.</v>

5011
02:15:33.710 --> 02:15:34.290
<v Speaker 4>When did,</v>

5012
02:15:34.290 --> 02:15:34.561
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

5013
02:15:34.561 --> 02:15:39.561
<v Speaker 4>when did the civilized folk learn of the larger animals on the plains?</v>

5014
02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:40.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5015
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.550
<v Speaker 4>when did they discover,</v>

5016
02:15:41.551 --> 02:15:43.080
<v Speaker 4>when did people discover elephants all?</v>

5017
02:15:43.081 --> 02:15:46.740
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't until 1900 people got down there.</v>

5018
02:15:46.741 --> 02:15:51.270
<v Speaker 4>Proper people might do when the explorers likes first saw a giraffe.</v>

5019
02:15:51.330 --> 02:15:51.841
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5020
02:15:51.841 --> 02:15:52.950
<v Speaker 4>How much would that blow your mind?</v>

5021
02:15:53.010 --> 02:15:53.131
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

5022
02:15:53.131 --> 02:15:54.750
<v Speaker 4>I guess we grew up with them though,</v>

5023
02:15:54.751 --> 02:15:55.171
<v Speaker 4>didn't we?</v>

5024
02:15:55.171 --> 02:15:55.501
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5025
02:15:55.501 --> 02:15:55.940
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

5026
02:15:55.940 --> 02:16:00.750
<v Speaker 4>if you believe that human life and emanated from the lower hominids that existed</v>

5027
02:16:00.751 --> 02:16:03.630
<v Speaker 4>in Africa and came down from the rain forest into the grasslands,</v>

5028
02:16:03.631 --> 02:16:04.830
<v Speaker 4>we would have probably been around them.</v>

5029
02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:06.630
<v Speaker 4>But what they would they have not to,</v>

5030
02:16:06.700 --> 02:16:08.560
<v Speaker 4>which is still not seem unfamiliar if you,</v>

5031
02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:09.660
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

5032
02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:10.890
<v Speaker 4>if you were from like Mongolia.</v>

5033
02:16:11.070 --> 02:16:11.401
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

5034
02:16:11.401 --> 02:16:13.710
<v Speaker 4>Then it'd be alien fun if you came over from,</v>

5035
02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:17.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean essentially if you go anywhere where you haven't been there before and</v>

5036
02:16:17.791 --> 02:16:18.660
<v Speaker 4>they have some new shit,</v>

5037
02:16:18.661 --> 02:16:19.021
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

5038
02:16:19.021 --> 02:16:21.180
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing with fucking Kangaroos everywhere?</v>

5039
02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:22.560
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>

5040
02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Well I have a friend named Eddie [inaudible],</v>

5041
02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:25.990
<v Speaker 1>he's a standup comic and uh,</v>

5042
02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:26.900
<v Speaker 1>he's done very well,</v>

5043
02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:26.900
<v Speaker 1>very</v>

5044
02:16:26.900 --> 02:16:29.230
<v Speaker 4>well in Australia and he goes over there quite a bit.</v>

5045
02:16:29.231 --> 02:16:29.980
<v Speaker 4>And one of the things</v>

5046
02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.830
<v Speaker 1>he told me was that he first encountered a kangaroo.</v>

5047
02:16:33.010 --> 02:16:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Kangaroos have killed people like many times.</v>

5048
02:16:35.501 --> 02:16:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Like they will fucking rip you apart.</v>

5049
02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't know how big bank got.</v>

5050
02:16:40.300 --> 02:16:41.190
<v Speaker 1>There's two kangaroos.</v>

5051
02:16:41.191 --> 02:16:42.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like a red one and a gray one.</v>

5052
02:16:42.191 --> 02:16:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

5053
02:16:42.730 --> 02:16:43.690
<v Speaker 1>One of them is giant,</v>

5054
02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:44.980
<v Speaker 1>one of them's like nine feet tall.</v>

5055
02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:48.760
<v Speaker 1>And he was out in this guy's yard and he saw this kangaroo and he thought it was</v>

5056
02:16:48.761 --> 02:16:50.680
<v Speaker 1>a statue cause it was too big.</v>

5057
02:16:51.070 --> 02:16:52.540
<v Speaker 1>He started walking towards it.</v>

5058
02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:53.291
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>

5059
02:16:53.291 --> 02:16:54.520
<v Speaker 1>cause it was nine feet tall.</v>

5060
02:16:54.550 --> 02:16:54.881
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5061
02:16:54.881 --> 02:16:55.714
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>

5062
02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:57.410
<v Speaker 1>well that's not really a kangaroo kangaroos.</v>

5063
02:16:57.420 --> 02:17:00.610
<v Speaker 1>I get that tall and his friends go stop walking.</v>

5064
02:17:00.611 --> 02:17:02.560
<v Speaker 1>I turn around now,</v>

5065
02:17:02.890 --> 02:17:06.670
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck away from that thing and tango like looks at them and all sudden</v>

5066
02:17:06.671 --> 02:17:07.180
<v Speaker 1>suddenly realize,</v>

5067
02:17:07.180 --> 02:17:07.961
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

5068
02:17:07.961 --> 02:17:09.690
<v Speaker 1>this is a nine foot squirreled.</v>

5069
02:17:09.691 --> 02:17:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's about the fuck me up.</v>

5070
02:17:12.460 --> 02:17:13.370
<v Speaker 1>That's a scary thought.</v>

5071
02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:16.480
<v Speaker 1>It's a nine foot jumping squirrel that will kick your guts out.</v>

5072
02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeye</v>

5073
02:17:18.250 --> 02:17:19.000
<v Speaker 6>but the thing is like,</v>

5074
02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.400
<v Speaker 6>like my points to Sunday,</v>

5075
02:17:20.430 --> 02:17:20.641
<v Speaker 6>he's,</v>

5076
02:17:20.641 --> 02:17:22.870
<v Speaker 6>or he's still seeing what occurring kangaroo looks like,</v>

5077
02:17:22.900 --> 02:17:25.480
<v Speaker 6>even if even if he's not expats in the nine foot one.</v>

5078
02:17:25.670 --> 02:17:25.960
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

5079
02:17:25.960 --> 02:17:27.070
<v Speaker 6>Like even if,</v>

5080
02:17:27.071 --> 02:17:27.161
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

5081
02:17:27.161 --> 02:17:29.530
<v Speaker 6>even if a velociraptor showed it right now in this room,</v>

5082
02:17:29.950 --> 02:17:30.251
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5083
02:17:30.251 --> 02:17:31.060
<v Speaker 6>we've seen it,</v>

5084
02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:31.720
<v Speaker 6>we've kind of see it,</v>

5085
02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:33.820
<v Speaker 6>we kind of know what they look light and no surprises,</v>

5086
02:17:34.210 --> 02:17:35.380
<v Speaker 6>but an alien landing.</v>

5087
02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:38.290
<v Speaker 6>Is that still kind of a shock to the system?</v>

5088
02:17:38.470 --> 02:17:39.670
<v Speaker 6>But then again on top of that,</v>

5089
02:17:39.700 --> 02:17:43.180
<v Speaker 6>the DMT Rome is completely removed altogether.</v>

5090
02:17:43.310 --> 02:17:43.551
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5091
02:17:43.551 --> 02:17:44.121
<v Speaker 1>And aliens.</v>

5092
02:17:44.121 --> 02:17:46.730
<v Speaker 1>The problem I always have with aliens as they look so much like us in the</v>

5093
02:17:46.731 --> 02:17:47.564
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

5094
02:17:47.750 --> 02:17:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5095
02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder whether or not light,</v>

5096
02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean the big,</v>

5097
02:17:51.801 --> 02:17:52.634
<v Speaker 1>the grand theories,</v>

5098
02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:55.880
<v Speaker 1>the simulation theory that we're living inside some sort of a artificial</v>

5099
02:17:55.881 --> 02:17:56.714
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

5100
02:17:56.750 --> 02:18:01.010
<v Speaker 1>And that the aliens are us and that's why we have this weird image of that being</v>

5101
02:18:01.011 --> 02:18:01.671
<v Speaker 1>us in the future.</v>

5102
02:18:01.671 --> 02:18:03.710
<v Speaker 1>We're already there and we didn't like it sucks.</v>

5103
02:18:03.740 --> 02:18:04.221
<v Speaker 1>It's boring.</v>

5104
02:18:04.221 --> 02:18:04.351
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

5105
02:18:04.351 --> 02:18:04.910
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

5106
02:18:04.910 --> 02:18:07.820
<v Speaker 1>we sort of evolve the fun out of life.</v>

5107
02:18:08.030 --> 02:18:11.870
<v Speaker 1>So we've created this crazy simulation that we all exist in.</v>

5108
02:18:12.470 --> 02:18:13.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the grand theory.</v>

5109
02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:16.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the grand theory involving the aliens for me at least,</v>

5110
02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:20.840
<v Speaker 1>if that's why they look like us and that's why they have big black things for</v>

5111
02:18:20.841 --> 02:18:21.674
<v Speaker 1>their eyes.</v>

5112
02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:25.010
<v Speaker 1>We fucked the environment so hard that you have to have sunglasses everywhere.</v>

5113
02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere you go,</v>

5114
02:18:26.510 --> 02:18:28.190
<v Speaker 1>you have to have built in sunglasses.</v>

5115
02:18:28.340 --> 02:18:30.560
<v Speaker 1>So we just artificially create sunglasses for each other.</v>

5116
02:18:30.561 --> 02:18:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Just put giant fucking black things every guy has done.</v>

5117
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:33.070
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

5118
02:18:33.070 --> 02:18:36.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't worry about the fucking hyper violent raise or whatever's out there and</v>

5119
02:18:36.921 --> 02:18:37.680
<v Speaker 1>with Jack and you,</v>

5120
02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:39.500
<v Speaker 1>we have really long fingers from texting.</v>

5121
02:18:39.650 --> 02:18:40.483
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5122
02:18:40.940 --> 02:18:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Well at that point in time you probably control everything with your mind so you</v>

5123
02:18:44.881 --> 02:18:45.100
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

5124
02:18:45.100 --> 02:18:46.310
<v Speaker 1>this is probably no need for muscles.</v>

5125
02:18:46.350 --> 02:18:47.240
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're so skinny.</v>

5126
02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:50.420
<v Speaker 1>There's a little tiny dudes with giant heads and they control everything with</v>

5127
02:18:50.421 --> 02:18:51.254
<v Speaker 1>their minds.</v>

5128
02:18:51.350 --> 02:18:51.741
<v Speaker 1>Do you think?</v>

5129
02:18:51.741 --> 02:18:53.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we could potentially evolve to that statement?</v>

5130
02:18:53.840 --> 02:18:54.673
<v Speaker 1>Questionably?</v>

5131
02:18:55.010 --> 02:18:56.120
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

5132
02:18:56.350 --> 02:18:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Even with the clicking send to this day,</v>

5133
02:18:58.570 --> 02:18:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I might,</v>

5134
02:18:59.020 --> 02:19:01.190
<v Speaker 1>this computer's not hooked up to anything Dan Hardee,</v>

5135
02:19:01.430 --> 02:19:02.450
<v Speaker 1>but yet it's on the Internet.</v>

5136
02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:05.270
<v Speaker 1>It's getting the Internet through the space around us.</v>

5137
02:19:05.510 --> 02:19:05.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5138
02:19:05.871 --> 02:19:08.990
<v Speaker 1>you're telling me that that can eventually be humidity consciousness itself,</v>

5139
02:19:08.991 --> 02:19:10.070
<v Speaker 1>traveling through space,</v>

5140
02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:12.370
<v Speaker 1>through some sort of a mechanism for,</v>

5141
02:19:12.371 --> 02:19:12.631
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

5142
02:19:12.631 --> 02:19:16.910
<v Speaker 1>for generating it or promoting it or projecting it have to fart theory and it's</v>

5143
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.823
<v Speaker 1>calming.</v>

5144
02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:18.950
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

5145
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:19.783
<v Speaker 1>As far</v>

5146
02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:22.220
<v Speaker 1>my alien fart theory is this.</v>

5147
02:19:22.550 --> 02:19:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5148
02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:25.280
<v Speaker 1>if someone farted and you didn't have a sense of smell,</v>

5149
02:19:25.281 --> 02:19:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you'd have no idea that you're sitting in someone's cause you can't see it.</v>

5150
02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:29.521
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5151
02:19:29.521 --> 02:19:30.370
<v Speaker 1>you'd really don't know.</v>

5152
02:19:30.371 --> 02:19:32.100
<v Speaker 1>In Florence are like a real far.</v>

5153
02:19:32.110 --> 02:19:32.370
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

5154
02:19:32.370 --> 02:19:34.080
<v Speaker 1>oh my God and you'll get the fuck out.</v>

5155
02:19:34.110 --> 02:19:34.800
<v Speaker 1>You close your mouth,</v>

5156
02:19:34.800 --> 02:19:36.870
<v Speaker 1>but you don't see a damn thing somehow.</v>

5157
02:19:36.871 --> 02:19:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I know that you've been affected by something that you didn't pick up with your</v>

5158
02:19:39.271 --> 02:19:41.670
<v Speaker 1>normal senses or with all of your normal senses.</v>

5159
02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.980
<v Speaker 1>You heard it and then you smelled it,</v>

5160
02:19:43.981 --> 02:19:44.910
<v Speaker 1>but you saw nothing.</v>

5161
02:19:45.090 --> 02:19:45.691
<v Speaker 1>How do we not know?</v>

5162
02:19:45.691 --> 02:19:49.170
<v Speaker 1>There's not an infinite amount of things all around us all the time that we just</v>

5163
02:19:49.171 --> 02:19:50.850
<v Speaker 1>do not have the ability to detach.</v>

5164
02:19:51.370 --> 02:19:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Quantify.</v>

5165
02:19:51.850 --> 02:19:52.683
<v Speaker 1>So that's your argument.</v>

5166
02:19:52.690 --> 02:19:54.090
<v Speaker 1>People that laugh at you when you use the word,</v>

5167
02:19:54.530 --> 02:19:55.770
<v Speaker 1>we use the term energy.</v>

5168
02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start talking about energy and stuff and like Bros delay.</v>

5174
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:02.281
<v Speaker 1>Bros are always problems.</v>

5175
02:20:02.281 --> 02:20:03.330
<v Speaker 1>It's always my fault though,</v>

5180
02:20:06.001 --> 02:20:06.810
<v Speaker 1>That's energy.</v>
