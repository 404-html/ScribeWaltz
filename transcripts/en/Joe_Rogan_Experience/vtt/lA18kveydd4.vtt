2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.033
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to defending America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not enough to merely have an </v>

3
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.863
<v Speaker 2>American presence in space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We must have American dominance in </v>

4
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.040
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So important.</v>

5
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.813
<v Speaker 2>Very importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here by directing the Department of </v>

6
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Defense and Pentagon to immediately </v>
<v Speaker 2>begin the process necessary to establish</v>

7
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 2>a space force as the sixth branch of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>armed forces.</v>

8
00:00:42.371 --> 00:00:43.204
<v Speaker 2>That's a big statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to have the air force and </v>

9
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:51.781
<v Speaker 2>we are going to have the space force </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate but equal.</v>

10
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.510
<v Speaker 2>It is going to be something so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

11
00:00:55.511 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 2>General Dunford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you would carry that assignment out,</v>

12
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 2>I would be very greatly on</v>

13
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.163
<v Speaker 3>look at Mike Pence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Pence has this look on his face </v>

14
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.824
<v Speaker 3>like I'm going to be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's motherfuckers gone completely </v>

15
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 3>crazy and I'm going to be the president </v>
<v Speaker 3>next.</v>

16
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 3>That's is not have approval.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at his face.</v>

17
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 3>He's got the face of a guy who knows </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's going to be the president.</v>

18
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 3>I give you are about to be awarded </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

20
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 3>something you were about to get and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

21
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I worked my whole life for this and here</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get that thing right now.</v>

23
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the fucking president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He must be like,</v>

24
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 3>this guy is never going to last eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

25
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 3>And for sure he's going to win again.</v>

26
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

27
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.863
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you think for sure he wins again </v>

28
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:47.524
<v Speaker 3>because is that because whoever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Democrats decided to put in is going to </v>

29
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 3>be an equal turd sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

30
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.050
<v Speaker 3>you're a super smart dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're also a brutal,</v>

31
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 3>your big giant savage motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

32
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.603
<v Speaker 3>So how many people have underestimated </v>
<v Speaker 3>you because you're a big giant savage </v>

33
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:04.204
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Plenty talk stupid to you and act like </v>

34
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 3>you're a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd say equal street fights.</v>

35
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Two fights in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

36
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

37
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.600
<v Speaker 3>And just people in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they'll get snotty,</v>

38
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 3>take stevie at treat young black men.</v>

39
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 3>But I think there's a certain part of us</v>
<v Speaker 3>that might be doing that with him.</v>

40
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's really good at winning.</v>

41
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.503
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

42
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.720
<v Speaker 3>this is not a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not an like an endorsement of him.</v>

43
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.360
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no caveats necessary.</v>

44
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.253
<v Speaker 3>I'm horrified by this immigration policy</v>
<v Speaker 3>of separating children from their </v>

45
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 3>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's subhuman.</v>

46
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 3>His wife came out and said that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullshit,</v>

47
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.570
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:50.800
<v Speaker 3>His wife's an immigrant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

49
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:53.050
<v Speaker 3>His wife barely speaks English.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's chaos,</v>

50
00:02:53.051 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

51
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 3>I hate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate all that stuff.</v>

52
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 3>These are just family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so just people love each.</v>

53
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 3>You got to keep them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they break the lie,</v>

54
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 3>you keep them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get them Outta here if you want.</v>

55
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:04.414
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to send them back to where </v>

56
00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:05.850
<v Speaker 3>they came from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

57
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.383
<v Speaker 3>you're hell bent on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But taking them from their kids is </v>

58
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.723
<v Speaker 3>subhuman.</v>

59
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beyond,</v>

60
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.053
<v Speaker 3>it's not us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not what we're doing in 2018 that </v>

61
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:16.714
<v Speaker 3>aside all that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably going to fucking win </v>

62
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:19.714
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

63
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.080
<v Speaker 3>I think he's probably gonna win again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he,</v>

64
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.043
<v Speaker 3>he gets in these confrontations with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and they think he's adult and I </v>

65
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 3>don't think he's an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's,</v>

66
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 3>there's no way he can be as successful </v>
<v Speaker 3>as he's been.</v>

67
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I know he's had his ups and downs and </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit like that,</v>

68
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.310
<v Speaker 3>but like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>

69
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.343
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he was able to dismantle all </v>

70
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.113
<v Speaker 3>those guys in those Republican debates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it didn't do what the fuck apart tore </v>

71
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 3>him apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had no business.</v>

72
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 3>They had no business doing that with </v>
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>

73
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 3>They just were too emotionally tied up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in his responses.</v>

74
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 3>There was so much negativity and energy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

75
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.543
<v Speaker 3>there's all this anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a fight where a guy's in full </v>

76
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 3>panic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

77
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.624
<v Speaker 3>you've seen like street fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially guys just go in a full panic </v>

78
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 3>or even just talking shit and the school</v>
<v Speaker 3>yard,</v>

79
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>

80
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 3>one guy's getting bullied.</v>

81
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.863
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got the crowd watching him and the </v>

82
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 3>other guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

83
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your your fuck you man.</v>

84
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

85
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.891
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

86
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 3>that ain't gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

87
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 3>That's Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what the rest of it looked like.</v>

88
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 3>Ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's what they all looked like.</v>

89
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 3>He's just been doing this his whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

90
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.090
<v Speaker 3>He's been talking shit his whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

91
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 3>And he's got a lot of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporters.</v>

92
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 3>And if the economy keeps doing good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

93
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.000
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be a hard sell to put some</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy in there like Bernie Sanders who you</v>

94
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:40.660
<v Speaker 3>know all the right wing people think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just want to give away all your money,</v>

95
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 3>give away all your money to welfare </v>
<v Speaker 3>brats.</v>

96
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 3>Even the left was protecting against </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

97
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

98
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 3>Cause there's still money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Money on the left.</v>

99
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 3>I should point out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know Jack Shit about politics.</v>

100
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.393
<v Speaker 3>It was very important to point out </v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that ever says you shouldn't be </v>

101
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 3>talking about politics.</v>

102
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy because anybody should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>able to talk about whatever they want.</v>

103
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.923
<v Speaker 3>But what I shouldn't do is give anybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>the impression that I know what I'm </v>

104
00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 3>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause I definitely don't like if you had</v>

105
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:05.764
<v Speaker 3>to get meat explained to you how </v>
<v Speaker 3>Congress and the Senate works and how </v>

106
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 3>long the terms are and what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the cat,</v>

107
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they have to do.</v>

108
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.520
<v Speaker 3>That'd be a sloppy ass fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

109
00:05:15.521 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm no political expert.</v>

110
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Mike Pence is no MMA expert.</v>

111
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

112
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 3>he probably could tell you who conor </v>
<v Speaker 3>mcgregor is.</v>

113
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.073
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's probably like we have equal </v>

114
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:29.480
<v Speaker 3>knowledge and government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

115
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 3>But still he might win just in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like games.</v>

116
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.660
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

117
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 3>It's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You definitely could look what did,</v>

118
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 3>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking game.</v>

119
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 3>It's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a very high stakes,</v>

120
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:44.740
<v Speaker 3>gigantic game where you're trying to win</v>
<v Speaker 3>a popularity contest.</v>

121
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.233
<v Speaker 3>He Won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you think of the rock </v>

122
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 3>potentially becoming president?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day that shit was,</v>

123
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.850
<v Speaker 3>that shit blew up and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>

124
00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:52.684
<v Speaker 3>Now if you look at the current state and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a popularity contest and we want </v>

125
00:05:56.411 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 3>somebody who can literally rock the Mike</v>
<v Speaker 3>has the gift of Gab.</v>

126
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.363
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you also have somebody who's </v>

127
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.650
<v Speaker 3>doing a monetarian shit is as famous as </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking anyone has ever been.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Highest Pay Dude in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He so nice too.</v>

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

131
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 3>you don't question his character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right Sweetheart?</v>

132
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a sweetheart.</v>

133
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 3>You meet them in real life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

134
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:23.710
<v Speaker 3>dot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To all these up motherfucker.</v>

135
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Big giant motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you could do it.</v>

136
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:27.793
<v Speaker 3>He could when he could win,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially if it was oprah's as vp and </v>

137
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm not even fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not saying it's a good idea,</v>

138
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

139
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 3>Not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying you don't think that the</v>

140
00:06:37.041 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 3>rock and Oprah could win you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who would,</v>

141
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.483
<v Speaker 3>who would be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women would get super pissed off if the </v>

142
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 3>rock was the president and Oprah was vp.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oprah would have to say,</v>

143
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's potentially next in line.</v>

144
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.230
<v Speaker 3>That's not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She has mike pence nodding in approval,</v>

145
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.123
<v Speaker 3>but she won.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people would want her to be </v>

146
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:54.524
<v Speaker 3>president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oprah to be the first female president </v>

147
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 3>to counter like the the first celebrity </v>
<v Speaker 3>president being trump.</v>

148
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.040
<v Speaker 3>Oprah counters that with the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>female celebrity president.</v>

149
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.963
<v Speaker 3>Ah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that's a big win with the Rock Vvp </v>

150
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.653
<v Speaker 3>in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was tough to get the rock to take a </v>

151
00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 3>fucking bag cs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know about that.</v>

152
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 3>That the rock is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the rock.</v>

153
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.690
<v Speaker 3>It's tough to get him to take a back </v>
<v Speaker 3>seat.</v>

154
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 3>It would be fascinating to see what </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens next.</v>

155
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>

156
00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 3>how we're going to try to play this out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how people are going to play this out,</v>

157
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.274
<v Speaker 3>the popularity contest aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's just okay if it really </v>

158
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 3>devolves into that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it holds like,</v>

159
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:38.654
<v Speaker 3>and here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much of his regulations are helping </v>

160
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 3>w and what and what do we do now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It has really fucked up.</v>

161
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 3>Maybe permanent consequences to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

162
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 3>That's true too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

163
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.733
<v Speaker 3>But what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what stuff have they implemented other </v>

164
00:07:57.531 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know they did offshore drilling,</v>

165
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.760
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That concerned a lot of people.</v>

166
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.680
<v Speaker 3>And it was explained better to me about </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

167
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.120
<v Speaker 3>the monuments and the private land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

168
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:13.230
<v Speaker 3>I've read a bunch of different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

169
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.083
<v Speaker 3>on public land rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read a bunch of different takes on </v>

170
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:16.514
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And essentially what they did is bring </v>

171
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 3>it back to where it was before the Obama</v>
<v Speaker 3>administration changed it.</v>

172
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 3>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was listed a certain way.</v>

173
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 3>And then when the Obama administration </v>
<v Speaker 3>changed it,</v>

174
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:30.884
<v Speaker 3>they felt that was an overstep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know why and it doesn't seem to </v>

175
00:08:35.721 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 3>be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

176
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.323
<v Speaker 3>they haven't started any like mineral </v>
<v Speaker 3>drills or oil drills or anything in </v>

177
00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 3>these areas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what they're doing,</v>

178
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.890
<v Speaker 3>but I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno if they're really just trying to</v>

179
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:46.724
<v Speaker 3>deregulate things more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like the government </v>

180
00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:49.094
<v Speaker 3>overstepped their boundaries or if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>really have nefarious ideas and they're </v>

181
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 3>trying to like figure out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>some oil out of a river will tell.</v>

182
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.361
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

183
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:58.194
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was that one place,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've discussed it before up in Alaska </v>

184
00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:05.050
<v Speaker 3>were a lot of people were concerned that</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was going to be some drilling that</v>

185
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 3>takes place near,</v>
<v Speaker 3>near where salmon live.</v>

186
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.193
<v Speaker 3>Like close enough that if it fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could destroy this river when it </v>

187
00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:14.694
<v Speaker 3>fucks up.</v>

188
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 3>That's the probably the best way to say </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

189
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because if,</v>

190
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 3>if we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we don't do anything about it,</v>

191
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.753
<v Speaker 3>like say if you put a pipeline in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth and he pumped oil through it and </v>

192
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 3>we don't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just leave it there.</v>

193
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Just leave it there and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

194
00:09:29.411 --> 00:09:31.630
<v Speaker 3>we don't visit it for 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

195
00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.330
<v Speaker 3>What's this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's that going to be like?</v>

196
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.150
<v Speaker 3>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means you got to keep fixing it.</v>

197
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you put a whole,</v>

198
00:09:39.221 --> 00:09:40.054
<v Speaker 3>you put a giant tube through the earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're pumping toxic ooze out of </v>

199
00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:46.600
<v Speaker 3>this tube.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sometimes it gets into rivers and it</v>

200
00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:48.670
<v Speaker 3>fucking kills everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's,</v>

201
00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.533
<v Speaker 3>you want to run this fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to run this tube under the </v>

202
00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:53.260
<v Speaker 3>river.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

203
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.380
<v Speaker 3>And then what are you gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how many every year?</v>

204
00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:58.150
<v Speaker 3>Every five years when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how long?</v>

205
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.910
<v Speaker 3>How often do you check in and when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>replace Shit,</v>

206
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 3>how long those tubes last?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno,</v>

207
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.320
<v Speaker 3>they got to check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I almost got into that.</v>

208
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:11.270
<v Speaker 3>What happens if there's an earthquake </v>
<v Speaker 3>and those tubes break?</v>

209
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.160
<v Speaker 3>Fuck City Wyatt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does that work?</v>

210
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.023
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack Shit about how they pump the oil </v>

211
00:10:17.981 --> 00:10:19.480
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you,</v>

212
00:10:19.481 --> 00:10:22.480
<v Speaker 3>what were you gonna say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

213
00:10:22.481 --> 00:10:26.440
<v Speaker 3>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a weird thing with,</v>

214
00:10:26.441 --> 00:10:28.660
<v Speaker 3>we know for sure they're going to one </v>
<v Speaker 3>day break.</v>

215
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.823
<v Speaker 3>Like we're making that toxic pipeline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we know for sure it's going to the </v>

216
00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.210
<v Speaker 3>earth's can just absorb it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

217
00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:35.410
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking the roads,</v>

218
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

219
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.880
<v Speaker 3>Have you seen them show like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

220
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.953
<v Speaker 3>a five year depiction of what would </v>
<v Speaker 3>happen to where bridges if we stopped </v>

221
00:10:41.141 --> 00:10:42.650
<v Speaker 3>painting?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

222
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.533
<v Speaker 3>It looks like it happens overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't there a show about this called </v>

223
00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 3>the life after humans or something?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

224
00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Was that on like nat geo or discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>

225
00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.860
<v Speaker 3>something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

226
00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:55.590
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of spots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

227
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.260
<v Speaker 3>particularly look at the southern </v>
<v Speaker 3>California deadly as quick may have been</v>

228
00:10:59.261 --> 00:11:00.094
<v Speaker 3>caused by oil drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ in 33 dozen Oklahoma now </v>

229
00:11:05.111 --> 00:11:08.170
<v Speaker 3>have a ton of earthquakes from fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

230
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.890
<v Speaker 3>But how could they know this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause earthquakes happen out here.</v>

231
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:16.140
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how they know this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

232
00:11:16.141 --> 00:11:19.570
<v Speaker 3>The study written by two leading US </v>
<v Speaker 3>Geological Survey,</v>

233
00:11:19.571 --> 00:11:20.404
<v Speaker 3>Stein scientists in Pasadena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shout out to Pasadena and be published </v>

234
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 3>in the bulletin of Seismic Society of </v>
<v Speaker 3>America on Tuesday.</v>

235
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Also suggest that three other </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes including magnitude 5.0</v>

236
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:32.634
<v Speaker 3>earthquakes in 1920 in inglewood and </v>
<v Speaker 3>1929 in whittier may have also been </v>

237
00:11:37.771 --> 00:11:39.870
<v Speaker 3>linked to oil drilling.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

238
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.760
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

239
00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.760
<v Speaker 3>maybe we live in California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

240
00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.620
<v Speaker 3>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe both.</v>

241
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it gave a little bump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was happening anyway.</v>

242
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.410
<v Speaker 3>Fuck knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it is.</v>

243
00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:55.450
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird.</v>

244
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.343
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The weirdest one for sure is nuclear </v>

245
00:11:58.511 --> 00:11:59.344
<v Speaker 3>power plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the weirdest one because they </v>

246
00:12:01.271 --> 00:12:02.104
<v Speaker 3>can't shut him off.</v>

247
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.993
<v Speaker 2>When you had a Shane Smith on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was talking about that kid that made </v>

248
00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:08.550
<v Speaker 2>a nuclear reactor in his garage had like</v>
<v Speaker 2>17 years old.</v>

249
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.430
<v Speaker 2>He's like 22 or 23 works for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

250
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.353
<v Speaker 2>What did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tracked him by the materials that </v>

251
00:12:13.771 --> 00:12:17.880
<v Speaker 2>he was purchasing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shut down a fucking city block when he,</v>

252
00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.790
<v Speaker 2>when he turned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was doing like fusion.</v>

253
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.270
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he could do a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that he could refine uranium.</v>

254
00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew how to fucking mine it.</v>

255
00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:31.610
<v Speaker 2>Get all the materials in the 17 that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>at 17 he's 22 now or 23 that's insane.</v>

256
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:32.913
<v Speaker 2>But he can take the used reactors and </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically like a handheld battery like </v>

257
00:12:37.261 --> 00:12:41.550
<v Speaker 2>you'd have on an RC car that can power </v>
<v Speaker 2>an entire city for 10,000</v>

258
00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:42.630
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Each one of those.</v>

259
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.250
<v Speaker 2>That's what Smith was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I know though,</v>

260
00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.293
<v Speaker 2>that's what Shane Smith was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy has that technology and of </v>

261
00:12:50.011 --> 00:12:53.700
<v Speaker 2>course you know they're there to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little Eddie Bravo ish.</v>

262
00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:55.500
<v Speaker 2>You know there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's big companies that don't want to</v>

263
00:12:55.501 --> 00:12:56.334
<v Speaker 2>see that happen but he supported by Elon</v>
<v Speaker 2>Musk and another other big time dudes </v>

264
00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.320
<v Speaker 2>that want to see it happen.</v>

265
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:02.623
<v Speaker 3>Well he would be the thing you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if once those nuclear </v>

266
00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:11.150
<v Speaker 3>reactors get up and running like the old</v>
<v Speaker 3>style ones like Fukushima,</v>

267
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if they have like a way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shut those down.</v>

268
00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they need ironically enough,</v>

269
00:13:17.511 --> 00:13:19.730
<v Speaker 3>I think they need power to shut him </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

270
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.063
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that like a big part of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem with Fukushima where they </v>

271
00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:26.570
<v Speaker 3>couldn't call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't keep it cool dude.</v>

272
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.940
<v Speaker 3>They can't shut them off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that is the crazy.</v>

273
00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:30.774
<v Speaker 3>They've only had them for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you stop and think about the amount </v>

274
00:13:33.651 --> 00:13:36.560
<v Speaker 3>of time humans have been alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's only been like</v>

275
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.543
<v Speaker 2>50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 years since like nuclear powers </v>

276
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.660
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

277
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.630
<v Speaker 3>Like what is the been the year for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bomb was dropped.</v>

278
00:13:45.631 --> 00:13:50.340
<v Speaker 3>And what was that 45 is that in 1945 I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know before my time.</v>

279
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your honor,</v>

280
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.440
<v Speaker 3>when you take the bomb was dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it 45 Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</v>

281
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.780
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm sorry I was looking up that they</v>

282
00:13:57.781 --> 00:14:01.200
<v Speaker 3>shut down power plants in Florida when </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hurricane went through last year.</v>

283
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:02.850
<v Speaker 3>Nuclear power plants.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

284
00:14:02.851 --> 00:14:03.684
<v Speaker 3>I think new ones they can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they could shut down the </v>

285
00:14:05.431 --> 00:14:06.264
<v Speaker 3>Fukushima one or I think it was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>damaged by the water so badly that </v>

286
00:14:10.711 --> 00:14:13.170
<v Speaker 3>whatever they're shutdown thing didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

287
00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.830
<v Speaker 3>but there's no like there's no way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>shut it down now.</v>

288
00:14:16.831 --> 00:14:20.550
<v Speaker 3>Now it's the fucking total meltdown </v>
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>

289
00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:21.990
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

290
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.360
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

291
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.940
<v Speaker 3>They've tried to come up with all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ways to store this shit.</v>

292
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:26.013
<v Speaker 3>Dee.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of them was dig a giant </v>

293
00:14:27.221 --> 00:14:28.054
<v Speaker 3>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pour all the waste in there and keep it </v>

294
00:14:29.771 --> 00:14:31.510
<v Speaker 3>frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't sound good.</v>

295
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:33.783
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like a really bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to put it in like this </v>

296
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:35.974
<v Speaker 3>giant Vat and they were going to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>this vat like super cooled to some like </v>

297
00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a low degree and do something,</v>

298
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.440
<v Speaker 3>correct me if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds like I'm making this up.</v>

299
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.680
<v Speaker 3>I've got Paul stamets could come up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way to fix that.</v>

300
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 3>How would you fix</v>

301
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.903
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mushrooms eat all the nuclear waste </v>

302
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:55.250
<v Speaker 4>doing the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did that.</v>

303
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:58.940
<v Speaker 4>He had the Ted talk a six ways mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 4>will save the world and it was at one of</v>

304
00:14:58.941 --> 00:14:59.774
<v Speaker 4>his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of them was oyster mushrooms eating </v>

305
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:02.264
<v Speaker 4>away oil spills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he fucking has like three giant vats </v>

306
00:15:06.861 --> 00:15:07.694
<v Speaker 4>of toxic waste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't say toxic like garbage and </v>

307
00:15:10.251 --> 00:15:11.084
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all coated in oil and he does </v>

308
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:15.380
<v Speaker 4>different things to two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then on the third one,</v>

309
00:15:15.381 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 4>he puts oyster mushroom spores in there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they cover him.</v>

310
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.590
<v Speaker 4>And the other two distinct to fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>hell.</v>

311
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 4>Like they get worse over time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

312
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:24.753
<v Speaker 4>The oyster mushrooms grow and they grow </v>
<v Speaker 4>black as the oil starts to be absorbed </v>

313
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 4>by them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they break down every single carbon</v>

314
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.053
<v Speaker 4>in the oil until eventually the oyster </v>
<v Speaker 4>mushroom becomes white again and it's </v>

315
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.684
<v Speaker 4>fucking edible lately.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Breaks it down and these are giant </v>

316
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:43.250
<v Speaker 4>oyster mushrooms like just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>massive to do.</v>

317
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.320
<v Speaker 4>You going to get BP cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're going to,</v>

318
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.840
<v Speaker 4>they're going to get cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

319
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:48.920
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we spell it.</v>

320
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.890
<v Speaker 4>We've got some fucking mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're good.</v>

321
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.590
<v Speaker 4>You guys give us three months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

322
00:15:54.591 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine a giant oil spill out </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the ocean?</v>

323
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.940
<v Speaker 4>And then the scientists drop like </v>
<v Speaker 4>billions of spores.</v>

324
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.940
<v Speaker 4>What does this gentleman know that might</v>
<v Speaker 4>not working in the ocean?</v>

325
00:16:04.941 --> 00:16:05.774
<v Speaker 4>Which can you imagine if they did do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it did work and you see these </v>

326
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 4>fucking building size mushrooms just </v>
<v Speaker 4>sucking oil out of the ocean.</v>

327
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.040
<v Speaker 4>That'd be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That'd be crazy.</v>

328
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:16.874
<v Speaker 4>And then they turn white and they become</v>
<v Speaker 4>edible and then just got to figure out </v>

329
00:16:20.451 --> 00:16:22.100
<v Speaker 4>how to do that with psilocybin and we're</v>
<v Speaker 4>golden.</v>

330
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

331
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 4>That would be an easy fix to find some </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to blend the two of them together.</v>

332
00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.060
<v Speaker 4>Don't Crongo crossbreed could they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

333
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 4>I know they do that with plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

334
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.460
<v Speaker 4>They gotta be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do they do that with plants?</v>

335
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.470
<v Speaker 4>Because they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

336
00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:42.410
<v Speaker 4>someone told me that blew me away that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there was um,</v>

337
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.693
<v Speaker 4>there were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were making pistachio trees and </v>

338
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:48.494
<v Speaker 4>they were binding them somehow or </v>
<v Speaker 4>another to avocado trees and they were </v>

339
00:16:53.331 --> 00:16:58.160
<v Speaker 4>making them like grow together to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a sturdier branch structure.</v>

340
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.870
<v Speaker 4>And what I've seen do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could mix trees.</v>

341
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.990
<v Speaker 4>I know here they have mixed trees but </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're from the same like file them.</v>

342
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.103
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're close enough genetically </v>

343
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 4>related.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you'd have like one base of the tree</v>

344
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.353
<v Speaker 4>that has the roots and then different </v>
<v Speaker 4>branches on that tree grow different </v>

345
00:17:17.301 --> 00:17:19.010
<v Speaker 4>fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are you going to have four different</v>

346
00:17:19.011 --> 00:17:22.370
<v Speaker 4>fruit styles on one tree?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like peaches,</v>

347
00:17:22.371 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 4>plums,</v>
<v Speaker 4>apricots,</v>

348
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.000
<v Speaker 4>all from one tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

349
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.863
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea you can buy that shit at </v>

350
00:17:29.661 --> 00:17:31.070
<v Speaker 4>Costco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe you.</v>

351
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.160
<v Speaker 4>I had no idea though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have assumed that.</v>

352
00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.970
<v Speaker 4>I would assume that like a tomato has to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be in a tomato tree.</v>

353
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.180
<v Speaker 4>You know that you can't splice it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tomato juice,</v>

354
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:44.510
<v Speaker 4>an apple tree tomato might not work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But as far as fruit trees.</v>

355
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:47.690
<v Speaker 4>So would be cool though to do that and </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you could do that with tomatoes.</v>

356
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Maybe could have beef steak on one side </v>
<v Speaker 4>and cherry</v>

357
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.690
<v Speaker 2>on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

358
00:17:51.691 --> 00:17:52.524
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Possible.</v>

359
00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:54.390
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have it all mixed up together.</v>

360
00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:56.863
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just what a strange life form </v>

361
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:05.020
<v Speaker 3>plants are bizarre compared to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's thing that lives alongside of us.</v>

362
00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.153
<v Speaker 3>Queens are ar for us cleans our air like</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York without central park would be </v>

363
00:18:11.661 --> 00:18:13.340
<v Speaker 3>so much grosser probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

364
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% have to be like all the carbon in </v>

365
00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:18.350
<v Speaker 3>the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carbon dioxide,</v>

366
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.460
<v Speaker 3>all the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just all the people breathe and everyone</v>

367
00:18:22.461 --> 00:18:23.960
<v Speaker 3>around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people,</v>

368
00:18:23.961 --> 00:18:24.794
<v Speaker 3>everyone just breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to like a soup of people </v>

369
00:18:27.351 --> 00:18:28.184
<v Speaker 3>breathing on the subway and in buildings</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know people are so jam next to </v>

370
00:18:33.021 --> 00:18:35.840
<v Speaker 3>each other whether walking by,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just breed in each other's air.</v>

371
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 3>That is such a weird way that people</v>

372
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.540
<v Speaker 2>blue decided to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

373
00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:42.374
<v Speaker 2>it is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just out there for a product </v>

374
00:18:44.271 --> 00:18:47.390
<v Speaker 2>development with on it and get to go out</v>
<v Speaker 2>to different conferences and shit.</v>

375
00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:48.973
<v Speaker 2>So when not to Secaucus New Jersey and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like a giant supplement </v>

376
00:18:52.221 --> 00:18:53.054
<v Speaker 2>conference where they have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's basically like people that do the </v>

377
00:18:57.591 --> 00:18:58.424
<v Speaker 2>science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out something really cool </v>

378
00:18:59.331 --> 00:19:01.790
<v Speaker 2>but they're not big enough name to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>it to the masses.</v>

379
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.430
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we come in along with other companies,</v>

380
00:19:04.431 --> 00:19:06.470
<v Speaker 2>we look for different things that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>backed by science,</v>

381
00:19:06.471 --> 00:19:08.120
<v Speaker 2>piece it all together and create </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new.</v>

382
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.223
<v Speaker 2>So we're doing that by day and then we </v>
<v Speaker 2>head over to a New York by night and it </v>

383
00:19:12.921 --> 00:19:14.120
<v Speaker 2>was cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like,</v>

384
00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:15.813
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking mad house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely insane to think that people </v>

385
00:19:18.761 --> 00:19:21.400
<v Speaker 2>live on that tiny little island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>

386
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it definitely buzzes.</v>

387
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.393
<v Speaker 2>It's got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got it's own fucking energy for </v>

388
00:19:25.841 --> 00:19:26.370
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

389
00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:27.660
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>

390
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:31.800
<v Speaker 3>And it's a little hostile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a hostility to that.</v>

391
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.200
<v Speaker 3>The comedy there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

392
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.130
<v Speaker 3>it sort of exemplifies that New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy,</v>

393
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:40.890
<v Speaker 3>it's always been some of the best comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the country.</v>

394
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:43.350
<v Speaker 3>Like oh ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's always been some of the best comics</v>

395
00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:47.760
<v Speaker 3>come out in New York and a lot of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>are like super hyper aggressive.</v>

396
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.553
<v Speaker 3>Like a lot of them like real insult </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians like that Kinda that style of </v>

397
00:19:55.321 --> 00:19:57.390
<v Speaker 3>shitting on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like they're,</v>

398
00:19:57.391 --> 00:19:58.224
<v Speaker 3>they're aggressively like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like patrice o'neal was </v>

399
00:20:00.841 --> 00:20:01.674
<v Speaker 3>probably like the best at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so fucking good and he was so </v>

400
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:04.944
<v Speaker 3>fucking good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he exemplifies that New York style </v>

401
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you wearing man?</v>

402
00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that shirt?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it would just be an attack.</v>

403
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.660
<v Speaker 3>And it was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was beautiful.</v>

404
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:16.770
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was fun.</v>

405
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.410
<v Speaker 3>It was all like in good fun and playful </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

406
00:20:19.411 --> 00:20:22.230
<v Speaker 3>but that New York style is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

407
00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:25.170
<v Speaker 3>it's like a harder style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a more aggressive style.</v>

408
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.033
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even families talk to each other </v>

409
00:20:26.671 --> 00:20:27.790
<v Speaker 3>differently there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

410
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.541
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

411
00:20:28.541 --> 00:20:29.730
<v Speaker 3>Were shit talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

412
00:20:29.731 --> 00:20:30.564
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried to figure this out myself </v>

413
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:32.364
<v Speaker 3>because my grandparents were immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I figured the way I was thinking it </v>

414
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:41.550
<v Speaker 3>is like if you really thought about the </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of people that were taking a chance</v>

415
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:46.530
<v Speaker 3>to come across the ocean and get here in</v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1920,</v>

416
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.770
<v Speaker 3>like these were wild,</v>
<v Speaker 3>desperate people.</v>

417
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.170
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was a different kind of human,</v>

418
00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.110
<v Speaker 3>they were there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wilder type of human being.</v>

419
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.543
<v Speaker 3>And then to go from that wild type of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human being to like a regular person in </v>

420
00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 3>2018 it's only been a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>generations.</v>

421
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.823
<v Speaker 3>Those places is where the people stayed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the people landed there first and </v>

422
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:11.254
<v Speaker 3>then all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the Polish and the Jewish and the </v>

423
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Italian and the Puerto Ricans and all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different different fucking ethnic</v>

424
00:21:17.771 --> 00:21:19.360
<v Speaker 3>group just piled in together.</v>

425
00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:21.310
<v Speaker 3>Just buzzing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people went,</v>

426
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 3>let's go west.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's fucking go west?</v>

427
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:25.683
<v Speaker 3>And they landed over here and this is </v>
<v Speaker 3>why California is like a quite a bit </v>

428
00:21:30.491 --> 00:21:32.440
<v Speaker 3>more mellow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

429
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:35.080
<v Speaker 3>quite a bit more laid back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even the comedy,</v>

430
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:37.180
<v Speaker 3>the comedians are more friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>

431
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.850
<v Speaker 3>but there is a great roast battle scene </v>
<v Speaker 3>up here too.</v>

432
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:43.570
<v Speaker 3>They do those roast battle shows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those things are pretty God damn good.</v>

433
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.660
<v Speaker 3>I love the roast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get nasty with each other.</v>

434
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.720
<v Speaker 3>You guys sit in the back of the comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>store and Talk Shit,</v>

435
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.381
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

436
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:52.600
<v Speaker 3>We talk shit to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's fun.</v>

437
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:53.463
<v Speaker 3>It's practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're making other comedians </v>

438
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:56.440
<v Speaker 3>laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome though.</v>

439
00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:57.274
<v Speaker 3>To be a fly on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watching a bunch of comedians just talk </v>

440
00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:00.960
<v Speaker 3>shit to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not even worried about other people,</v>

441
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:03.400
<v Speaker 3>not trying to make anybody laugh with </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

442
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:06.360
<v Speaker 3>We all talk shit and less joey's around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when Joey's around,</v>

443
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:07.540
<v Speaker 3>just try to get them riled up.</v>

444
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:11.283
<v Speaker 3>When Joey's around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my main goal is try to get them angry </v>

445
00:22:13.451 --> 00:22:14.284
<v Speaker 3>about something and just does hear him </v>
<v Speaker 3>go off and that's when the magic </v>

446
00:22:17.141 --> 00:22:17.974
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be something you've got to </v>

447
00:22:19.331 --> 00:22:23.290
<v Speaker 3>bring up some fucking band he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>like or some food.</v>

448
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:24.124
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And next thing you know he's throwing </v>

449
00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:28.264
<v Speaker 3>his arms back and he's fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody orders the ranch sauce with </v>

450
00:22:31.211 --> 00:22:33.250
<v Speaker 3>their salad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chicken wings.</v>

451
00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.380
<v Speaker 3>Chicken wings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

452
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:35.793
<v Speaker 3>just that one statement.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's blue cheese with wings or go fuck </v>

453
00:22:38.201 --> 00:22:43.201
<v Speaker 3>your mother is and it's just the way he </v>
<v Speaker 3>says it to.</v>

454
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.123
<v Speaker 3>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we're in the back of Joey's back </v>

455
00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just let joey rant.</v>

456
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:48.963
<v Speaker 3>We just tried to get him riled up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we'll have conversations with </v>

457
00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:53.710
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just once I have a conversation,</v>

458
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.740
<v Speaker 3>but half the time it's like a game of </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

459
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.840
<v Speaker 3>you know you're hanging around with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>funniest guy ever.</v>

460
00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 3>If you can get that guy to laugh and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy to make everybody laugh,</v>

461

<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

584
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.300
<v Speaker 4>If I shit my pants once every three </v>

<v Speaker 4>If I don't,</v>

588
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.110
<v Speaker 4>if I don't push the envelope and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>not taking that chance.</v>

589
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.123
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

591
00:28:34.231 --> 00:28:36.240

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:38.723
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird that certain foods that are </v>

<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

597
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.940

<v Speaker 4>What's all the oil?</v>

598
00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:55.530
<v Speaker 4>What does it look?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did you want diarrhea?</v>

599
00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.880

601
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm not dealing with this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's just flush it out.</v>

602
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.520
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that you think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fart and you should know better.</v>

603
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:06.151

<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

604
00:29:06.151 --> 00:29:07.260
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that feels like air.</v>

605
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.860
<v Speaker 4>We're good to let this out and then it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not so much underwear.</v>

606
00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:12.720
<v Speaker 4>You can walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not Good.</v>

607
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.780
<v Speaker 4>Then you've got to drive home with your </v>
<v Speaker 4>hips off the seat the whole way.</v>

608
00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:16.643
<v Speaker 4>It's good exercise though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For your lower pelvic [inaudible] </v>

609
00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.733
<v Speaker 4>activate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>loosen up the front side it mail key </v>

610
00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:24.750
<v Speaker 4>eagles.</v>

611
00:29:24.751 --> 00:29:25.680
<v Speaker 4>holding it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>period of time,</v>

614
00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.073
<v Speaker 4>like women to do that competitively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know that there's like </v>

615
00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.330
<v Speaker 4>competitions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the golden carrot?</v>

616
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:38.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are some dedicated people.</v>

617
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 4>Like I would imagine most girls are like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Regina is great by itself.</v>

618
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:49.030
<v Speaker 4>You don't really have to squeeze it </v>
<v Speaker 4>until come some muscular.</v>

619
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:50.850
<v Speaker 4>You can't train itself.</v>

620
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.713
<v Speaker 4>you know you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how many trained in the brain you </v>

621
00:29:53.321 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how many people do it?</v>

622
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:55.653
<v Speaker 4>I would like to know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe if there was an anonymous </v>

623
00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:57.814
<v Speaker 4>thing where women can answer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet that 1% how many of them squeeze </v>

624
00:30:01.331 --> 00:30:03.420
<v Speaker 4>their pussy all the time and just do </v>
<v Speaker 4>exercises.</v>

625
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.293

<v Speaker 4>then she's carrying weights around and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's doing yoga record padding,</v>

627
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:18.190
<v Speaker 4>vaginal weightlifter.</v>

<v Speaker 4>there's a hole in the middle of it where</v>

629
00:30:20.741 --> 00:30:22.900
<v Speaker 4>that rope goes through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing.</v>

630
00:30:22.901 --> 00:30:24.670
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a rough looking rope.</v>

631
00:30:24.671 --> 00:30:26.730
<v Speaker 4>Tude man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like a rope that you would,</v>

632
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:32.750
<v Speaker 4>you would tie like a dog to a tree with </v>

<v Speaker 4>That's all I got.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

637
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.570
<v Speaker 4>it's nice that she's moving through </v>
<v Speaker 4>different positions.</v>

638
00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:48.850
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

<v Speaker 4>she's working it.</v>

641
00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.593
<v Speaker 4>This is the sexual equivalent to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking that overdose of those pills or </v>

642

<v Speaker 4>equivalent because you don't want to get</v>

644
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.560

<v Speaker 4>I would just,</v>

647
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.560
<v Speaker 4>I would enter that and roll the dice and</v>
<v Speaker 4>see how strong that is.</v>

664
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:03.700
<v Speaker 4>planted early on in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably too early maybe.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

670
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.330
<v Speaker 4>If there was an exercise that you told </v>
<v Speaker 4>me Your deck,</v>

671
00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:29.164
<v Speaker 4>you've talked about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but their tribes in Africa where they </v>

676
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.710
<v Speaker 4>work those muscles on top of the cock to</v>
<v Speaker 4>flex the the weight up and down,</v>

<v Speaker 4>side proportionately.</v>

691
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.003
<v Speaker 4>Like what percentage of girls that lift </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight go immediately to boody </v>

<v Speaker 4>girls that really want to put on that </v>
<v Speaker 4>booty mass.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like a high percentage.</v>

696
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Do you think the Dick strengthener would</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it shorter and fatter?</v>

697
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.640
<v Speaker 4>It would be dick strengthening gyms </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

698
00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:58.220
<v Speaker 4>But what it turned you into a coke can?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

699
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.100

00:33:59.101 --> 00:33:59.934
<v Speaker 4>it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would have to be like you could grow </v>

<v Speaker 4>He could actually create more tissue.</v>

702
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:09.410
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What he's showing us?</v>

703
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:13.640
<v Speaker 4>I can't find the name of this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guys trying to hang like Asian weights</v>

704
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:14.923
<v Speaker 4>from his Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They got like all these cattle bells </v>

705
00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.710
<v Speaker 4>hanging from his deck and the girl's </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

706
00:34:20.711 --> 00:34:24.270
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

707
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.500
<v Speaker 4>what is the name of this movie again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't find the name of it.</v>

708
00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:32.900
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be a parody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she's got to keep them hard.</v>

709
00:34:34.430 --> 00:34:37.010
<v Speaker 4>There's a black guy looking at him like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck are you coming over there,</v>

711
00:34:40.731 --> 00:34:43.220
<v Speaker 4>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if there was something like that,</v>

712
00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:47.270
<v Speaker 4>like something like a glute ham machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

713
00:34:47.271 --> 00:34:49.790
<v Speaker 4>something that just targeted the deck,</v>

789
00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:07.290
<v Speaker 3>sort of a skirt over it.</v>

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:55.130
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really apologize for not remembers.</v>

806
00:38:55.131 --> 00:39:00.131
<v Speaker 5>Now I want to say Brian Foster to do it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was his fault and you,</v>

807
00:39:03.841 --> 00:39:07.240
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but in training he got uh,</v>

808
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.120
<v Speaker 5>he got kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>kicked low.</v>

809
00:39:09.121 --> 00:39:10.620
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he didn't have a cup on.</v>

810
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:12.730
<v Speaker 5>It's like one more round one with that </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of deal.</v>

811
00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:14.080
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll spar one more round.</v>

812
00:39:14.081 --> 00:39:15.640
<v Speaker 5>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And wham.</v>

813
00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:17.490
<v Speaker 5>I never understood that when guys </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't work.</v>

814
00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:19.810
<v Speaker 5>Cups and sparring.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So crazy.</v>

815
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.570
<v Speaker 5>Don't roll the dice there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's too risky.</v>

816
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.150
<v Speaker 5>Did you wear it everywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's tie steel cup.</v>

817
00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:27.340
<v Speaker 5>Cain was big into that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I didn't like that it went up.</v>

818
00:39:27.341 --> 00:39:29.080
<v Speaker 5>Your asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

819
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:30.670
<v Speaker 5>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

820
00:39:30.671 --> 00:39:33.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Plus they're smaller,</v>

821
00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.653
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they don't like the American ones </v>

822
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:39.370
<v Speaker 5>come stairways to brag.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying,</v>

823
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:42.550
<v Speaker 5>I'm just saying they were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looked like it looked like it'd be in</v>

824
00:39:42.551 --> 00:39:43.930
<v Speaker 5>a tight spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's all.</v>

825
00:39:43.931 --> 00:39:44.764
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well you can't make a cup for 140 pound </v>

826
00:39:47.531 --> 00:39:52.531
<v Speaker 5>Thai guy and then make that same cut fed</v>
<v Speaker 5>on gorillas like yourself.</v>

827
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.380
<v Speaker 5>Just need a bigger cup.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just part of just your gloves.</v>

828
00:39:56.381 --> 00:39:57.850
<v Speaker 5>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a little bit of space.</v>

829
00:39:57.851 --> 00:39:59.200
<v Speaker 5>That's all I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you have,</v>

830
00:39:59.201 --> 00:40:00.034
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is it like that leather thick padding </v>

831
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 5>around the edges of it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

832
00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.690
<v Speaker 5>So like when it goes into you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't go into it straight.</v>

833
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.630
<v Speaker 5>It was like the rubber with a hard </v>
<v Speaker 5>plastic,</v>

834
00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.640
<v Speaker 5>like a baseball Kabaddi guys like those.</v>

835
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 5>There was this dude Amea rent of Rd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was one of 'em Bas rutten's proteges.</v>

836
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:19.383
<v Speaker 5>And we used to train with them at </v>
<v Speaker 5>Eddie's place and he'd mount you and he </v>

837
00:40:21.851 --> 00:40:22.684
<v Speaker 5>had that fucking steel cup and it would </v>
<v Speaker 5>be like he was crushing your sternum </v>

838
00:40:26.381 --> 00:40:30.460
<v Speaker 5>with his Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was uber uncomfortable who's not fun.</v>

839
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.210
<v Speaker 5>He was very good at that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would get mount on you and just crush</v>

840
00:40:34.211 --> 00:40:38.860
<v Speaker 5>you down like you like unnatural </v>
<v Speaker 5>leverage in arm bars as well.</v>

841
00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.873
<v Speaker 5>When you go over that Steel Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you got a metal thing that you're </v>

842
00:40:42.971 --> 00:40:45.430
<v Speaker 5>bending someone's arm against,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a big deal.</v>

843
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.470
<v Speaker 5>It's a really big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you think about it.</v>

844
00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.300
<v Speaker 5>I mean you would think like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait a minute,</v>

845
00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.160
<v Speaker 5>I go even a regular arm bar,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hold on.</v>

846
00:40:51.161 --> 00:40:54.940
<v Speaker 5>You're pulling his arm into your balls </v>
<v Speaker 5>like what the fuck?</v>

847
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:56.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you are.</v>

848
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.123
<v Speaker 5>You are your Dick and balls are resting </v>
<v Speaker 5>on someone's arm when you give them an </v>

849
00:41:01.031 --> 00:41:02.860
<v Speaker 5>arm bar that has just a fact.</v>

850
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:03.993
<v Speaker 5>If you don't like that fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your goal in fact is to get your Dick </v>

851
00:41:06.641 --> 00:41:11.110
<v Speaker 5>and balls to rest on this guy's arm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you're not thinking about that.</v>

852
00:41:11.111 --> 00:41:12.850
<v Speaker 5>You're thinking of getting your hips </v>
<v Speaker 5>down on him,</v>

853
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.953
<v Speaker 5>getting that arm in between your legs or</v>
<v Speaker 5>getting to a arm in between your arms </v>

854
00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.390
<v Speaker 5>and your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>extending your body.</v>

855
00:41:19.391 --> 00:41:23.740
<v Speaker 5>But if you have any steel cop dare you </v>
<v Speaker 5>got this crazy fulcrum.</v>

856
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:26.680
<v Speaker 5>You get this weird leverage point and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's made out of metal.</v>

857
00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.880
<v Speaker 5>It's a fucking metal piece.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So instead of having vulnerable balls,</v>

858
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.950
<v Speaker 5>you have this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

859
00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.960
<v Speaker 5>you have like a lever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could snap shit better.</v>

860
00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.560
<v Speaker 5>Mike Swift popped my rib out two days </v>
<v Speaker 5>before a fight with his cup.</v>

861
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 5>This one right here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Damn.</v>

862
00:41:41.451 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 5>It still fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

863
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.660
<v Speaker 5>Reset that way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

864
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.880
<v Speaker 5>It's from those Goddamn Steel Cups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

865
00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:47.231
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

866
00:41:47.231 --> 00:41:49.190
<v Speaker 5>I mean this wicked teen and just dug </v>
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>

867
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:52.670
<v Speaker 5>his cup was writing under a rib and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was dead tired last,</v>

868
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:56.600
<v Speaker 5>last round of training of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 5>fight camp and popped it out.</v>

869
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:57.943
<v Speaker 5>I wonder how controversial I'm so out of</v>
<v Speaker 5>the loop when it comes to grappling </v>

870
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.920
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] grappling competitions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wonder,</v>

871
00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.780
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how legal they are.</v>

872
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.700
<v Speaker 5>I wonder if they're allowed to use them </v>
<v Speaker 5>at all.</v>

873
00:42:07.701 --> 00:42:08.360
<v Speaker 5>I wish.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

874
00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think they get to,</v>

875
00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.300
<v Speaker 5>to use cups if any sort and it to sort.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

876
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:16.370
<v Speaker 5>Without the crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would want to wear a cup.</v>

877
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:17.383
<v Speaker 5>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've been smashed and then nuts before </v>

878
00:42:18.321 --> 00:42:19.730
<v Speaker 5>in training.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to get to,</v>

879
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:22.190
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's a loud wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's crazy.</v>

880
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.083
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No cups at all because of that fulcrum </v>

881
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:26.160
<v Speaker 5>point probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

882
00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:27.560
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Must Be.</v>

883
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.050
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy that your dick would become </v>
<v Speaker 5>an advantage,</v>

884
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.303
<v Speaker 5>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that area instead of like being </v>

885
00:42:33.531 --> 00:42:34.364
<v Speaker 5>like one object changes what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it goes from being like a super </v>

886
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:40.400
<v Speaker 5>vulnerable area to Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if I get you there,</v>

887
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:42.320
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even like north south,</v>

888
00:42:42.321 --> 00:42:45.440
<v Speaker 5>like Cain and happy in north south and </v>
<v Speaker 5>just fucking digging into the side of my</v>

889
00:42:45.441 --> 00:42:45.980
<v Speaker 5>face.</v>

890
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.380
<v Speaker 5>Oh Jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I'm sure his ball sweat there too,</v>

891
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:50.960
<v Speaker 5>but I mean really that no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they would fuck me up.</v>

892
00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:51.973
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got a metal bar driving in your </v>

893
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:54.104
<v Speaker 5>face,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a real piece of metal and if you kicked </v>

894
00:42:56.301 --> 00:42:58.790
<v Speaker 5>those fucking things,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you pay for it.</v>

895
00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.940
<v Speaker 5>Like if you kick those things and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>slap it with your instep,</v>

896
00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:03.950
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah.</v>

897
00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:05.283
<v Speaker 5>It's like you might as well be kicking a</v>
<v Speaker 5>rock or kicking the bottom of someone's </v>

898
00:43:07.881 --> 00:43:08.714
<v Speaker 5>elbow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Worse than young Jamie and running down </v>

899
00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.530
<v Speaker 5>the mountain and his vibrams.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

900
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.510
<v Speaker 5>Young Jamie tried to go barefoot shoe </v>
<v Speaker 5>running.</v>

901
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 5>Which one did you go?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you get the vivo barefoot or get the</v>

902
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.413
<v Speaker 5>vivas?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>super thin.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I got one that has like a lot of tread </v>

907
00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.240
<v Speaker 5>that's like a got a good thick amount of</v>
<v Speaker 5>tread and then another one that has less</v>

908
00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:32.203
<v Speaker 5>and the the one that has less like you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could feel the difference when you run </v>

909
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.840
<v Speaker 5>like these real slippery steep slopes.</v>

910
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:40.123
<v Speaker 5>I need something where I can dig in if </v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to like sprint up to the top </v>

911
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:45.470
<v Speaker 5>of the hill and I don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>worried about my footing.</v>

912
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 5>I want to be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm tired at that point too.</v>

913

919
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.910
<v Speaker 5>I don't have an endorsement with any of </v>
<v Speaker 5>these people.</v>

920
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.160
<v Speaker 5>I don't have any kind of deals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the,</v>

921
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:10.230
<v Speaker 5>what I like about the vibrams is for </v>
<v Speaker 5>sure it feels like you,</v>

922
00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:14.300
<v Speaker 5>you're moving more with your pinkies,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like your pinky toes and the other toes.</v>

923
00:44:14.301 --> 00:44:15.050
<v Speaker 5>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're like,</v>

924
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.760
<v Speaker 5>they were aware that they have a job.</v>

925
00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:17.893
<v Speaker 5>Whereas I feel like when I wear it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even barefoot shoes that have full </v>

926
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:22.760
<v Speaker 5>coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like they're like,</v>

927
00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.040
<v Speaker 5>they're lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just along for the ride.</v>

928
00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:25.741
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll just take,</v>

929
00:44:25.741 --> 00:44:26.680
<v Speaker 5>we'll just take a break.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

930
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:27.770
<v Speaker 5>we'll take a break,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but was,</v>

931
00:44:27.771 --> 00:44:32.460
<v Speaker 5>whereas I feel all that shit activated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It might be just in my head,</v>

932
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:36.480
<v Speaker 5>but when I run with five finger shoes on</v>
<v Speaker 5>a trail run with those things on,</v>

933
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:37.314
<v Speaker 5>I feel like my foot is moving just a wee</v>
<v Speaker 5>bit more than even regular barefoot </v>

934
00:44:40.441 --> 00:44:41.274
<v Speaker 5>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something about having all those little </v>

935
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:43.164
<v Speaker 5>fuckers free like that and they feel </v>
<v Speaker 5>their feeling and dirt the way they're </v>

936
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:46.830
<v Speaker 5>supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're,</v>

937
00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:47.693
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're moving together the same way </v>

938
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:49.404
<v Speaker 5>your hands moved together when you grab </v>
<v Speaker 5>all your fall and gravel or something </v>

939
00:44:51.511 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 5>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your hand,</v>

940
00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it moves together.</v>

941
00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:54.951
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

942
00:44:54.951 --> 00:44:55.784
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's thinking of how to cushion blows </v>

943
00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 5>and how to stop something that's coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>your way and how to,</v>

944
00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:02.880
<v Speaker 5>how to interact with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with space.</v>

945
00:45:02.881 --> 00:45:05.250
<v Speaker 5>Where's your footage is kind of clubbing</v>
<v Speaker 5>the ground all the time.</v>

946
00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:06.653
<v Speaker 5>I feel like with those shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the one thing I'm aware of is that the </v>

947
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:10.104
<v Speaker 5>foot is acting like as in it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the little individual muscles are </v>

948
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:14.490
<v Speaker 5>helping to push me around.</v>

949
00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.930
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's massive.</v>

950
00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:17.853
<v Speaker 4>I've noticed that on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'll walk wearing them right now </v>

951
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:23.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm at where I'm all the time right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one's mother fucker walks around with</v>

952
00:45:23.291 --> 00:45:24.124
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

953
00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:26.740
<v Speaker 4>Once I started walking him on a longterm</v>
<v Speaker 4>basis,</v>

954
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:30.100
<v Speaker 4>especially doing longer walks and jugs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's a clear cut difference.</v>

955
00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:33.100
<v Speaker 4>You have to be mindful of every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>step you take.</v>

956
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:35.530
<v Speaker 4>Especially if they're thinner sold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

957
00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.170
<v Speaker 4>they make some fix old ones for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for trail running and whatnot.</v>

958
00:45:38.171 --> 00:45:39.220
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use those.</v>

959
00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I use those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only,</v>

960
00:45:40.841 --> 00:45:43.420
<v Speaker 4>the only time I use the really thin ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>are at the gym.</v>

961
00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:46.060
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are the ones I have.</v>

962
00:45:46.061 --> 00:45:48.820
<v Speaker 4>Jamie there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

963
00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:51.170
<v Speaker 4>you just got watch out for like sharp </v>
<v Speaker 4>rocks.</v>

964
00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Then I don't have to watch out for sharp</v>
<v Speaker 4>rocks.</v>

965
00:45:53.151 --> 00:45:55.530
<v Speaker 4>And the other ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if I'm running in,</v>

966
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:57.770
<v Speaker 4>something's kind of funky and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta go,</v>

967
00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.940
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to land on that.</v>

968
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:00.770
<v Speaker 4>I gotta look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta pay attention.</v>

969
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with those other ones,</v>

970
00:46:02.361 --> 00:46:06.080
<v Speaker 4>I could just kind of hustle and breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but maybe that's not as good.</v>

971
00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:09.540
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's better to do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

972
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:10.374
<v Speaker 4>maybe it engages your brain more forces </v>
<v Speaker 4>you to think and make decisions while </v>

973
00:46:16.081 --> 00:46:18.200
<v Speaker 4>you were exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Actually,</v>

974
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.980
<v Speaker 4>it might be better now that I'm thinking</v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

975
00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:22.440
<v Speaker 4>It might be a better thing to do as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>workout.</v>

976
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.190
<v Speaker 4>You're more present to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

977
00:46:24.191 --> 00:46:26.310
<v Speaker 4>you have to get about other bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like,</v>

978
00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:27.163
<v Speaker 4>you know when we're talking about our </v>
<v Speaker 4>tree or the cold bath or any of these </v>

979
00:46:29.251 --> 00:46:31.820
<v Speaker 4>things it tells you in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to,</v>

980
00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:32.663
<v Speaker 4>I think part of it for some people with </v>
<v Speaker 4>running is like that getting into the </v>

981
00:46:35.521 --> 00:46:36.480
<v Speaker 4>zone thing</v>

982
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:37.413
<v Speaker 5>that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when you start getting a pace </v>

983
00:46:38.561 --> 00:46:39.394
<v Speaker 5>going and just get into that zone when </v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want to think about any other </v>

984
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:45.363
<v Speaker 5>extraneous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And if you're doing that and watching </v>

985
00:46:47.441 --> 00:46:49.570
<v Speaker 5>every step you take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is there,</v>

986
00:46:49.571 --> 00:46:52.080
<v Speaker 5>is it possible,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just throwing this out there that'll</v>

987
00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:52.923
<v Speaker 5>would like inhibit you from getting to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the zone cause you'd have to be too </v>

988
00:46:55.151 --> 00:46:56.830
<v Speaker 5>conscious about every step you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>taking.</v>

989
00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:57.771
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

990
00:46:57.771 --> 00:46:59.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure everyone's different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

991
00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.130
<v Speaker 4>But for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I do that,</v>

992
00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it draws me into the zone.</v>

993
00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:05.713
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because if I can just run on a fucking </v>

994
00:47:06.681 --> 00:47:08.540
<v Speaker 4>treadmill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not worried about where my feet go,</v>

995
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:10.760
<v Speaker 4>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then my mind will wander then.</v>

996
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:11.773
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't have to pay attention </v>

997
00:47:12.461 --> 00:47:13.730
<v Speaker 4>and it'll start thinking about other </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

998
00:47:13.731 --> 00:47:15.480
<v Speaker 4>especially if it's an easy run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

999
00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:18.740
<v Speaker 4>My mind will wander then it's not dialed</v>
<v Speaker 4>in because it doesn't have to be.</v>

1000
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of cardio machines do you use,</v>

1001
00:47:22.071 --> 00:47:25.340
<v Speaker 4>if any?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well one that I really like.</v>

1002
00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.473
<v Speaker 4>I mean all I can use right now cause my </v>
<v Speaker 4>niece fucked is the ski Erg and I that </v>

1003
00:47:29.381 --> 00:47:29.980
<v Speaker 4>Aubrey and I'll get</v>

1004
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.860
<v Speaker 2>on those and do some sprint work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're saying you have a,</v>

1005
00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.070
<v Speaker 2>was it an MCL tear or torn meniscus?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1006
00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thankfully no surgery required with that</v>

1007
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.593
<v Speaker 2>cause the placement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But and so you got some stem cells on </v>

1008
00:47:41.501 --> 00:47:42.131
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1009
00:47:42.131 --> 00:47:42.964
<v Speaker 2>we did stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they do last week we did a </v>

1010
00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:50.581
<v Speaker 2>umbilical stem cells intra-nasal a I v </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the knee with Gouda town.</v>

1011
00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:54.320
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new,</v>

1012
00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 2>the needed hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I thought the fucking injection was</v>

1013
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:58.930
<v Speaker 2>going to hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they are going to wiggle it in with</v>

1014
00:47:58.931 --> 00:48:01.360
<v Speaker 2>some long ass needle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that wasn't bad.</v>

1015
00:48:01.361 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 2>The pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once it goes in,</v>

1016
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:04.930
<v Speaker 2>that fucking hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1017
00:48:04.931 --> 00:48:05.764
<v Speaker 2>stem cells fixed my left knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having problems with my left knee </v>

1018
00:48:08.471 --> 00:48:09.304
<v Speaker 2>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a acl reconstruction on that knee </v>

1019
00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.730
<v Speaker 2>and on that knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1020
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.960
<v Speaker 2>they took some meniscus out as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been a problem.</v>

1021
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:21.730
<v Speaker 2>Like whenever I would work out real hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>look two or three days in a row,</v>

1022
00:48:21.731 --> 00:48:24.490
<v Speaker 2>it was always sore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd walk around and was just sore.</v>

1023
00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:25.563
<v Speaker 2>It was B and then I have to warm it up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get going one session with a </v>

1024
00:48:30.011 --> 00:48:30.844
<v Speaker 2>umbilical cord stem cells and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave it a long time off and I never had </v>

1025
00:48:34.091 --> 00:48:36.190
<v Speaker 2>a problem with it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you literally went away.</v>

1026
00:48:36.191 --> 00:48:38.020
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of those things where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a problem.</v>

1027
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:41.110
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't have a problem anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he'll running,</v>

1028
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:43.270
<v Speaker 2>kicking the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever I'm doing.</v>

1029
00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>using that echo bike or the versaclimber</v>

1030
00:48:45.911 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 2>anything I'm doing with my knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problems.</v>

1031
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm just babying it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we work with this guy Dr.</v>

1032
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:56.320
<v Speaker 2>Craig conover who did the stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been doing a vitamin IVS at a on it</v>

1033
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:57.970
<v Speaker 2>for us and he's a fucking savage.</v>

1034
00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.580
<v Speaker 2>We'll do like the ntd treatments in Nad </v>
<v Speaker 2>socks about.</v>

1035
00:49:00.581 --> 00:49:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Greenfield was telling me really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really it is official yet as fuck.</v>

1036
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Tell me about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like we get it done at an ivy.</v>

1037
00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:11.160
<v Speaker 2>What's the name stand for again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's nicotine [inaudible] at an,</v>

1038
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I had a dean at Dennis saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know nicotine identity at Dennis</v>

1039
00:49:16.811 --> 00:49:18.700
<v Speaker 2>seen die nucleotide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

1040
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1041
00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.940
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1042
00:49:22.941 --> 00:49:23.774
<v Speaker 2>it's basically food for the Mitochondria</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can influence that pathway </v>

1043
00:49:26.741 --> 00:49:28.870
<v Speaker 2>through fascinating hot and cold </v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy,</v>

1044
00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.910
<v Speaker 2>a high intensity intervals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things like that,</v>

1045
00:49:30.911 --> 00:49:33.700
<v Speaker 2>but just to get it mainlined into your </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking body,</v>

1046
00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:34.803
<v Speaker 2>it feels like someone's got their hand </v>
<v Speaker 2>on your stomach and they're slowly </v>

1047
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:39.340
<v Speaker 2>turning it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't feel good.</v>

1048
00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 2>You fucking sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If people have nasal issues,</v>

1049
00:49:42.161 --> 00:49:44.620
<v Speaker 2>they'll sneak it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel like it's turning your stomach.</v>

1050
00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:45.454
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea is that because it </v>

1051
00:49:48.191 --> 00:49:49.024
<v Speaker 2>influences mitochondrial biogenesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to kill off any old </v>

1052
00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:53.163
<v Speaker 2>mitochondria that needed to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you want that in the gut and then </v>

1053
00:49:55.871 --> 00:49:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you get new ones and over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1054
00:49:58.301 --> 00:50:02.540
<v Speaker 2>we front load this a four to eight days </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a row and by the end of this,</v>

1055
00:50:02.541 --> 00:50:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I mean like front row front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>load it every single day.</v>

1056
00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:06.003
<v Speaker 2>You do it for eight days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why then you only need it like once a </v>

1057
00:50:08.741 --> 00:50:10.390
<v Speaker 2>month or once every two weeks after </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1058
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little touch ups after every single day.</v>

1059
00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:16.120
<v Speaker 2>Every single day you're getting gut </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrenched.</v>

1060
00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But by the end of it,</v>

1061
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:18.304
<v Speaker 2>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because you've gotten rid of most of </v>

1062
00:50:19.601 --> 00:50:21.370
<v Speaker 2>the bad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1063
00:50:21.371 --> 00:50:22.360
<v Speaker 2>that's theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

1064
00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is brand new stuff here.</v>

1065
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:25.870
<v Speaker 2>We've got to be pseudo sciences on rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me,</v>

1066
00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:28.420
<v Speaker 2>let me say that this is the science </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

1067
00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Rats is always like a weird thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1068
00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:33.230
<v Speaker 2>but I'll tell you that the feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feeling is,</v>

1069
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:35.330
<v Speaker 2>is there's no fucking dot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works.</v>

1070
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:36.283
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that influences mitochondria </v>

1071
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.530
<v Speaker 2>influences everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's energy for your brain.</v>

1072
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Cognitive function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>

1073
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:41.683
<v Speaker 2>lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole nine Greenfield was saying </v>

1074
00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:43.874
<v Speaker 2>that he had the Mitochondria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like the telomere lengths and they </v>

1075
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:48.500
<v Speaker 2>check his telomere length.</v>

1076
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.250
<v Speaker 2>That is biological age was 20 so he went</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1077
00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.510
<v Speaker 2>he went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started,</v>

1078
00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:54.590
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And listened to him.</v>

1079
00:50:54.591 --> 00:50:56.480
<v Speaker 2>He had the Telo years guy on right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1080
00:50:56.481 --> 00:50:57.314
<v Speaker 2>so I did the same test and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological age was 36 and his </v>

1081
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:05.390
<v Speaker 2>chronological age was 34 and I'm like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker who was homeschooled k</v>

1082
00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:06.224
<v Speaker 2>through 12 and it's an Ironman </v>
<v Speaker 2>triathlete is two years older </v>

1083
00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:13.550
<v Speaker 2>biologically than chronologically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where the fuck am I went to Asu?</v>

1084
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Did all the bad drugs get hit in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head fucking countless times.</v>

1085
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:18.950
<v Speaker 2>I gotta be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be bad.</v>

1086
00:51:18.951 --> 00:51:23.951
<v Speaker 2>So at 35 when I did mine a biological </v>
<v Speaker 2>age of 41 and I'm like fuck.</v>

1087
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:27.830
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but right after he did the systemic stem</v>

1088
00:51:27.831 --> 00:51:32.831
<v Speaker 2>cells through the ivy that dropped him </v>
<v Speaker 2>from 36 to 20 years old biologically.</v>

1089
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.150
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how many did he do?</v>

1090
00:51:35.151 --> 00:51:36.200
<v Speaker 2>How many sessions did he do?</v>

1091
00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just after the first one.</v>

1092
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:41.240
<v Speaker 2>I know he's done a more and he did </v>
<v Speaker 2>different stem cells.</v>

1093
00:51:41.241 --> 00:51:42.074
<v Speaker 2>So why you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are you guys doing it so many days </v>

1094
00:51:43.221 --> 00:51:45.410
<v Speaker 2>in a row for the Ntd?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1095
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:47.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of front loading,</v>

1096
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:48.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they used to say that with creatine.</v>

1097
00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that's been debunked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are certain substances,</v>

1098
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:51.944
<v Speaker 2>especially with how they influence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can really ramp up and change the </v>

1099
00:51:55.401 --> 00:51:57.860
<v Speaker 2>body dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after that you just need little</v>

1100
00:51:57.861 --> 00:52:00.800
<v Speaker 2>touch ups here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1101
00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just feel like,</v>

1102
00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:04.970
<v Speaker 2>what'd you feel like after with the ned?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

1103
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.170
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

1104
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:07.063
<v Speaker 2>I want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really be able to look at this like a </v>

1105
00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:10.160
<v Speaker 2>quantified self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1106
00:52:10.161 --> 00:52:11.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be able to take numbers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and shit.</v>

1107
00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:15.680
<v Speaker 2>So what I did was I put myself through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat grinder.</v>

1108
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't really been trained in a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1109
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.153
<v Speaker 2>since you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working my first real nine to five kind </v>

1110
00:52:21.231 --> 00:52:22.920
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1111
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:23.893
<v Speaker 2>I train twice a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>busted out the old altitude machine was </v>

1112
00:52:26.061 --> 00:52:28.730
<v Speaker 2>doing altitude every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hot and cold,</v>

1113
00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got the dual sauna on it.</v>

1114
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:31.063
<v Speaker 2>I do the cold bath at home and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>during that process because we've got </v>

1115
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:35.900
<v Speaker 2>the little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little guy,</v>

1116
00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sleeping well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so put myself through all that.</v>

1117
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.260
<v Speaker 2>My fucking cardio went through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never got sick.</v>

1118
00:52:42.261 --> 00:52:44.780
<v Speaker 2>I recovered well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I knew it worked.</v>

1119
00:52:44.781 --> 00:52:46.100
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1120
00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:47.750
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function,</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory,</v>

1121
00:52:47.751 --> 00:52:48.584
<v Speaker 2>retention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was fucking scaling up a </v>

1122
00:52:49.881 --> 00:52:52.610
<v Speaker 2>notch and cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1123
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your cardio ramped up.</v>

1124
00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Anything that influences mitochondria </v>
<v Speaker 2>affects fucking all of it.</v>

1125
00:52:57.651 --> 00:53:01.250
<v Speaker 2>That's ATP throughout your entire body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's brain too.</v>

1126
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think of like,</v>

1127
00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:04.760
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the,</v>

1128
00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:05.623
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons they're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea team right now as a nootropic </v>

1129
00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:13.190
<v Speaker 2>because he influences atp and the Bra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every fucking thing in your body runs on</v>

1130
00:53:13.191 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 2>ATP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How have they done studies on this yet?</v>

1131
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:17.210
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think greenfield might be a better guy</v>

1132
00:53:17.211 --> 00:53:18.044
<v Speaker 2>to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm,</v>

1133
00:53:18.050 --> 00:53:21.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty certain that they verified </v>
<v Speaker 2>that creatine helps,</v>

1134
00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.170
<v Speaker 2>helps the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it makes sense if it helps muscles,</v>

1135
00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:25.221
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1136
00:53:25.221 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 2>if it helps blood</v>

1137
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.800
<v Speaker 4>flow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1138
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:30.353
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's gotta be a bunch of different </v>

1139
00:53:31.861 --> 00:53:33.840
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's energy,</v>

1140
00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.900
<v Speaker 4>it's seller cellular energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>ATP is right.</v>

1141
00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:40.170
<v Speaker 4>So everything runs on that one thing and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're good there.</v>

1142
00:53:40.171 --> 00:53:42.780
<v Speaker 4>Whether you're in Ketosis or you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating carbohydrates,</v>

1143
00:53:42.781 --> 00:53:46.620
<v Speaker 4>it's all going back to ATP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1144
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.790
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do that.</v>

1145
00:53:47.791 --> 00:53:48.624
<v Speaker 4>You could have someone inject something </v>
<v Speaker 4>into you and all of a sudden you get </v>

1146
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 4>this like this recharge state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there there's the debate.</v>

1147
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this healthy?</v>

1148
00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:58.060
<v Speaker 4>Has it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the long term?</v>

1149
00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.850
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah I and then all this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1150
00:53:59.851 --> 00:54:01.650
<v Speaker 4>it's funny because some of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>drawbacks,</v>

1151
00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.530
<v Speaker 4>I have a certain amount of followers </v>
<v Speaker 4>online then you know,</v>

1152
00:54:04.531 --> 00:54:06.500
<v Speaker 4>you go to a company like on it and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

1153
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:09.300
<v Speaker 4>it's magnified right by a hundred by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>thousand,</v>

1154
00:54:09.301 --> 00:54:11.000
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1155
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anytime I post shit,</v>

1156
00:54:12.181 --> 00:54:15.210
<v Speaker 4>cause I'll do stuff online for like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>bio hack of the week at the life hack of</v>

1157
00:54:15.211 --> 00:54:15.570
<v Speaker 4>the week.</v>

1158
00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes it's just run of the mill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1159
00:54:18.660 --> 00:54:19.493
<v Speaker 4>go for a fucking farmer's walk with some</v>
<v Speaker 4>weights in your hand or keep a </v>

1160
00:54:21.661 --> 00:54:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Kettlebell in your trunk and then you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can always work out whatever.</v>

1161
00:54:24.510 --> 00:54:26.820
<v Speaker 4>Or sometimes it's more technology based </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we,</v>

1162
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:30.840
<v Speaker 4>we get a lot of shit on anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology based.</v>

1163
00:54:30.841 --> 00:54:33.420
<v Speaker 4>And of course the argument then is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1164
00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:34.373
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe I can get everything I need </v>

1165
00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:39.090
<v Speaker 4>from a good diet and good nutrition and </v>
<v Speaker 4>movement and I don't need to inject shit</v>

1166
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:40.080
<v Speaker 4>to be healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>

1167
00:54:40.081 --> 00:54:42.900
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I like greenfields model,</v>

1168
00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:43.763
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you have one foot and then sister </v>

1169
00:54:44.671 --> 00:54:46.740
<v Speaker 4>living in one foot in the benefits of </v>
<v Speaker 4>modern science.</v>

1170
00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So why wouldn't I fuck with that?</v>

1171
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a smart way to approach </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1172
00:54:50.641 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 4>I think we have a real problem and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>always have,</v>

1173
00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as human beings being tribal,</v>

1174
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.680
<v Speaker 4>and I'm on tribe natural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all natural bro.</v>

1175
00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.490
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't take,</v>

1176
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:01.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm not into hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>

1177
00:55:01.471 --> 00:55:03.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't need my cell phone man.</v>

1178
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:04.104
<v Speaker 4>I'd rather leave it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we've got tribe science who </v>

1179
00:55:06.781 --> 00:55:07.950
<v Speaker 4>think that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1180
00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.370
<v Speaker 4>that science is going to figure </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything out and nature ain't shit.</v>

1181
00:55:11.371 --> 00:55:12.630
<v Speaker 4>And just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're better than nature.</v>

1182
00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:13.523
<v Speaker 4>We're smarter than nature as forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's obviously the extremes of each </v>

1183
00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:19.050
<v Speaker 4>end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but people just tend to fucking do that.</v>

1184
00:55:19.051 --> 00:55:20.880
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was the most ridiculous video that</v>

1185
00:55:20.881 --> 00:55:21.714
<v Speaker 4>I retweeted from barstool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was barstool just find out </v>

1186
00:55:25.831 --> 00:55:26.664
<v Speaker 4>who I retweeted it from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we'd give him credit on their </v>

1187
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.320
<v Speaker 4>instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they,</v>

1188
00:55:29.330 --> 00:55:30.540
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was it barstool?</v>

1189
00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:36.410

<v Speaker 4>one side was saying right fields sucks.</v>

1190
00:55:40.530 --> 00:55:43.740
<v Speaker 4>And the other side was singing left </v>
<v Speaker 4>field sucks.</v>

1191
00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.560
<v Speaker 4>And they would yell it out on twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here we go.</v>

<v Speaker 4>they will.</v>

1196
00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:02.460
<v Speaker 4>The team,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that side on the left side is the burst.</v>

1197
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.533
<v Speaker 4>Like here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Play this is it a Barstool barstool </v>

1200
00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:14.740
<v Speaker 6>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] we're not going to take,</v>

1201
00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:32.353
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1202
00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:35.500
<v Speaker 3>say if I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would enjoy every second of that.</v>

1203
00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:38.890
<v Speaker 3>Especially if I had a couple beers in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot dog in me I had been yelling at too.</v>

1204
00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.173
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1205
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what's fun.</v>

1206
00:56:42.551 --> 00:56:43.384
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're all rooting for the same </v>

1207
00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:47.380
<v Speaker 3>team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows?</v>

1208
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.760
<v Speaker 3>How do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1209
00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:50.043
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they don't fucking split the sides </v>

1210
00:56:51.191 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a home.</v>

1211
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Does anybody ever again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do that and soccer,</v>

1212
00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.210
<v Speaker 3>it might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There might be a section,</v>

1213
00:56:58.211 --> 00:57:00.220
<v Speaker 3>but there's still people all over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1214
00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 3>But for both teams.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1215
00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they're not rude on the same team,</v>

1216
00:57:04.570 --> 00:57:05.403
<v Speaker 3>but like conceivably they could just go </v>
<v Speaker 3>the hall that it proved my point even </v>

1217
00:57:08.201 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 3>further though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because now you have both,</v>

1218
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:12.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>say it's cubs and,</v>

1219
00:57:12.941 --> 00:57:14.190
<v Speaker 3>and a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1220
00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.750
<v Speaker 3>Cubs fans and giants fans sitting on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>right field,</v>

1221
00:57:16.751 --> 00:57:20.200
<v Speaker 3>both yelling to the left field to left </v>
<v Speaker 3>field sucks.</v>

1222
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And cubs and giants fans on left field,</v>

1223
00:57:22.961 --> 00:57:26.770
<v Speaker 3>both yelling at to right field.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bringing people together.</v>

1224
00:57:26.771 --> 00:57:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan to hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.640
<v Speaker 3>For at least it's fake hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1226
00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:31.980
<v Speaker 3>they don't really think those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>suck.</v>

1227
00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:32.814
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're out sat them down as </v>

1228
00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:34.054
<v Speaker 3>individuals and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you really think about these </v>

1229
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:36.850
<v Speaker 3>random people on the right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1230
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:38.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just folks that are sitting over</v>

1231
00:57:38.261 --> 00:57:41.650
<v Speaker 3>there watching the baseball game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this a parallel for politics,</v>

1232
00:57:41.890 --> 00:57:42.940
<v Speaker 3>for life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend,</v>

1233
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:45.490
<v Speaker 3>for all of this life?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1234
00:57:45.491 --> 00:57:46.324
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1235
00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.193
<v Speaker 3>It's probably something to that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might be also why trump could win </v>

1236
00:57:49.331 --> 00:57:51.340
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He can,</v>

1237
00:57:51.341 --> 00:57:52.174
<v Speaker 3>when he up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody that believes that he won't win </v>

1238
00:57:53.741 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're the same people that believed.</v>

1239
00:57:55.631 --> 00:57:56.464
<v Speaker 3>He stood no chance of winning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The first time did I took a photo of </v>

1240
00:57:58.121 --> 00:58:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Jake Tapper on TV when the results were </v>
<v Speaker 3>being read because he was,</v>

1241
00:58:02.861 --> 00:58:03.694
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing one of them report things and he </v>

1242
00:58:04.421 --> 00:58:06.520
<v Speaker 3>had the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>through the entire election,</v>

1243
00:58:06.521 --> 00:58:10.510
<v Speaker 3>he was like really very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very obviously,</v>

1244
00:58:10.530 --> 00:58:11.363
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in an angst at the thought of this guy </v>

1245
00:58:13.301 --> 00:58:14.134
<v Speaker 3>being president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when he finally became </v>

1246
00:58:16.301 --> 00:58:18.820
<v Speaker 3>President Jake Tapper's face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like,</v>

1247
00:58:18.821 --> 00:58:20.740
<v Speaker 3>it's so classic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1248
00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:24.130
<v Speaker 3>it's one of those moments where you like</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheese Christ.</v>

1249
00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:25.893
<v Speaker 3>I'm never going to forget that guys face</v>
<v Speaker 3>when trump was elected because it was </v>

1250
00:58:28.751 --> 00:58:31.870
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is this?</v>

1251
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:37.930
<v Speaker 3>It was just a crazy face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1252
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:41.170
<v Speaker 3>if everything works out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody dies.</v>

1253
00:58:41.171 --> 00:58:43.510
<v Speaker 3>No extra people die because of trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>being president.</v>

1254
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:47.650
<v Speaker 3>This will be a very fascinating time to </v>
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>

1255
00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:49.883
<v Speaker 3>be a very fascinating time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's ever been a time </v>

1256
00:58:51.631 --> 00:58:52.464
<v Speaker 3>like this man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drug laws are relaxing all over the </v>

1257
00:58:54.961 --> 00:58:55.690
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

1258
00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:56.523
<v Speaker 3>they're pushing MTMA through maps is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get it to use use for therapy for </v>

1259
00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.330
<v Speaker 3>soldiers with PTSD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it works remarkably well.</v>

1260
00:59:03.331 --> 00:59:04.164
<v Speaker 3>It works better than fucking anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been able to guide a couple of </v>

1261
00:59:06.601 --> 00:59:08.670
<v Speaker 3>those sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Couple's therapy sessions,</v>

1262
00:59:08.730 --> 00:59:11.940
<v Speaker 3>not the PTSD sessions have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>fucking incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1264
00:59:14.101 --> 00:59:19.101

<v Speaker 3>I've never seen people break up prior to</v>

1265
00:59:19.531 --> 00:59:20.730
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I don't really have the,</v>

1266
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:22.460

1280
00:59:50.901 --> 00:59:53.570
<v Speaker 2>but with any psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the true psychedelic,</v>

1281
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:54.503
<v Speaker 2>true psychedelic like Marco Polo say </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be like a trip to mean based </v>

1282
00:59:56.691 --> 00:59:58.580
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the classical psychedelics.</v>

1283
00:59:58.581 --> 00:59:59.414
<v Speaker 2>You look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're thinking of things like </v>

1286

<v Speaker 2>mushrooms,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Iowasca dmt.</v>

1289
01:00:07.761 --> 01:00:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Those kinds of things would be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional.</v>

1290
01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:10.401
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1291

<v Speaker 2>I would honestly say that I think in </v>

1292
01:00:14.031 --> 01:00:17.510
<v Speaker 2>high doses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>edible marijuana is a psychedelic.</v>

01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:18.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1294
01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:19.610
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>

1295
01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:20.960
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1296
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.850
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people argue against that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1297
01:00:22.900 --> 01:00:24.560
<v Speaker 2>fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1298

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1299
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.910
<v Speaker 2>when you close your eyes and lie down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sit down on a couch on a high dose,</v>

1300
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.130
<v Speaker 2>you're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really flying.</v>

1301
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:36.530
<v Speaker 2>I've had visuals from fucking gorilla </v>
<v Speaker 2>glue,</v>

1302
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:38.300
<v Speaker 2>just smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gorilla glue.</v>

<v Speaker 2>what do you mean gorilla glue?</v>

1304
01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a strain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Actual Glue.</v>

1305
01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was huffing [inaudible] with my wife.</v>

1306
01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:45.850
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I met with anything.</v>

1307
01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:49.130
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking podcast took a turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1308
01:00:49.131 --> 01:00:50.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kingsbury.</v>

1309
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.100
<v Speaker 2>So savage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's out there smoking glue,</v>

1310
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.560
<v Speaker 2>gorilla glue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the name.</v>

1311
01:00:54.561 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to be a good father.</v>

1312
01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.630
<v Speaker 2>And you experienced it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Streets it fucking full blown,</v>

1313
01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:00.493
<v Speaker 2>full blown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know you can get a man if you get </v>

1314
01:01:02.421 --> 01:01:03.254
<v Speaker 2>high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mckenna used to say to the way to do it </v>

1315
01:01:04.641 --> 01:01:05.474
<v Speaker 2>was to not get high for long periods of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and then smoke as much as you can </v>

1316
01:01:09.111 --> 01:01:11.330
<v Speaker 2>handle in one setting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not my jam.</v>

1317
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.373
<v Speaker 2>I've been using a one one milligram thc </v>
<v Speaker 2>spray and I microdose cannabis fairly </v>

1318
01:01:18.591 --> 01:01:21.380
<v Speaker 2>often just in just in the evening and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>helps with sleep.</v>

1319
01:01:21.810 --> 01:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this Mtma man,</v>

1320
01:01:23.031 --> 01:01:24.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a whole fucking different ball </v>
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

1321
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:25.574
<v Speaker 2>I think it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you should try if I can request </v>

1322
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.113
<v Speaker 2>at some point you tried the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical grade Mtma just to know </v>

1323
01:01:31.581 --> 01:01:34.280
<v Speaker 2>what it's all about because Rick Doblin </v>
<v Speaker 2>was saying you give it,</v>

1324
01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:37.280
<v Speaker 2>you give it space like you would with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>classical hallucinogen.</v>

1325
01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:38.353
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to fucking go back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to work the next day or do a bunch of </v>

1326
01:01:41.241 --> 01:01:43.640
<v Speaker 2>bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tedious drawn back into the real world.</v>

1327
01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Give it space journal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditate,</v>

1328
01:01:46.251 --> 01:01:48.320
<v Speaker 2>throw on some easy listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>music and rest.</v>

1329
01:01:48.350 --> 01:01:49.183
<v Speaker 2>And if you do that you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in their protocol they're not </v>

1330
01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:55.370
<v Speaker 2>allowed to use anything else but the </v>
<v Speaker 2>MTMA.</v>

1331
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:56.263
<v Speaker 2>So I asked him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you guys have a protocol for </v>

1332
01:01:57.951 --> 01:02:00.020
<v Speaker 2>five htp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vitamin C,</v>

1333
01:02:00.021 --> 01:02:00.854
<v Speaker 2>different things we know help build back</v>
<v Speaker 2>the neurotransmitter support you may </v>

1334
01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:06.920
<v Speaker 2>have lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said just with the finagling with</v>

1335
01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:08.510
<v Speaker 2>the FDA and everything they have to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>

1336
01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:09.344
<v Speaker 2>he says it's fucking impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we give him that day off their </v>

1337
01:02:12.201 --> 01:02:13.034
<v Speaker 2>gold and then of course new mood plug on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it again was designed for that </v>

1338
01:02:18.171 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 2>experience to be to curtail</v>

1339
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.173
<v Speaker 4>any kind of come down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had zero issues after using the </v>

1340
01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:25.740
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical grade.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the original name of it?</v>

1341
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Roll on roll off or what was it like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1342
01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:29.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was something like that.</v>

1343
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was five htp boosters,</v>

1344
01:02:32.851 --> 01:02:36.810
<v Speaker 4>like I mean five htp supplementation has</v>
<v Speaker 4>been going on from a long time.</v>

1345
01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.500
<v Speaker 4>Lot of people have been into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

1346
01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:39.683
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a smart way to approach Mtma till </v>

1347
01:02:41.191 --> 01:02:44.280
<v Speaker 4>like to stock up to have a bunch of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>system so your,</v>

1348
01:02:44.281 --> 01:02:45.114
<v Speaker 4>your body is going to have to build this</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit up again because you're going to </v>

1349
01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:47.304
<v Speaker 4>flood it with it for awhile so you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to have this weird little period </v>

1350
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:53.360
<v Speaker 4>where your body is going to struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's a,</v>

1351
01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.273
<v Speaker 4>it's a thing that I would hope if this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these studies do continue to prove </v>

1352
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:00.203
<v Speaker 4>without a doubt that it's beneficial to </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of these people that they make it </v>

1353
01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:04.290
<v Speaker 4>available to more people.</v>

1354
01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.250
<v Speaker 4>It will be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it will be,</v>

1355
01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:06.084
<v Speaker 4>should be quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They estimate 2022 I think or 2023 at </v>

1356
01:03:08.911 --> 01:03:09.744
<v Speaker 4>the latest [inaudible] he got a f the </v>
<v Speaker 4>FDA made a breakthrough drug I think </v>

1357
01:03:14.341 --> 01:03:15.174
<v Speaker 4>breakthrough drug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like on the fast track to go </v>

1358
01:03:16.951 --> 01:03:17.784
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the whole world would be way </v>

1359
01:03:19.111 --> 01:03:23.400
<v Speaker 4>better if everybody was on just like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>micro dose of ecstasy all the time.</v>

1360
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.470
<v Speaker 4>Just a little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a little like Ah,</v>

1361
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:27.533
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that that could last but </v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be medicine cause it's micro </v>

1362
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:30.541
<v Speaker 4>dose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing.</v>

1363
01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:31.374
<v Speaker 4>You talk about compassion and all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>other important lessons that have been </v>

1364
01:03:34.291 --> 01:03:37.140
<v Speaker 4>talked about in all spiritual texts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's automatic.</v>

1365
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.630
<v Speaker 4>You drop right into that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1366
01:03:39.631 --> 01:03:43.740
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that it's possible to train</v>
<v Speaker 4>your brain to produce more of it?</v>

1367
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:44.723
<v Speaker 4>Do you think through meditation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>mindfulness and all these different </v>

1368
01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:52.020
<v Speaker 4>practices that people do to stay </v>
<v Speaker 4>present,</v>

1369
01:03:52.021 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 4>to be more open,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more loving,</v>

1370
01:03:53.821 --> 01:03:55.260
<v Speaker 4>that you could build that up?</v>

1371
01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.093
<v Speaker 4>Almost like a muscle?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that you could build </v>

1372
01:03:58.770 --> 01:03:59.603
<v Speaker 4>serotonin up over time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's some type of cap where </v>

1373
01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:04.290
<v Speaker 4>nature nature does not want us to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>happy.</v>

1374
01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:05.124
<v Speaker 4>24,</v>
<v Speaker 4>seven.</v>

1375
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:06.930
<v Speaker 4>Is there any tricks though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1376
01:04:06.931 --> 01:04:09.270
<v Speaker 4>to like getting it to turn on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a book,</v>

1377
01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:10.123
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the science of mindfulness by doctor </v>

1378
01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:11.724
<v Speaker 4>Ronald Siegel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on one of the great courses on </v>

1379
01:04:13.021 --> 01:04:13.854
<v Speaker 4>audible and he's a harvard professor and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he talks about the brain like a fucking </v>

1380
01:04:16.951 --> 01:04:19.950
<v Speaker 4>muscle and sciences back this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you train that,</v>

1381
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.160
<v Speaker 4>the easier it is to drop into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've had coaches,</v>

1382
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:24.900
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breathwork coaches,</v>

1383
01:04:24.901 --> 01:04:26.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're working with the art of breath.</v>

1384
01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:28.273
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rob Wilson and Brian Mackenzie came out </v>

1385
01:04:29.251 --> 01:04:30.084
<v Speaker 4>and they did like a full fucking blown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have breath working on it and the </v>

1386
01:04:33.631 --> 01:04:34.464
<v Speaker 4>more often you can shift into </v>
<v Speaker 4>parasympathetic state from fight or </v>

1387
01:04:36.751 --> 01:04:37.800
<v Speaker 4>flight sympathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1388
01:04:37.801 --> 01:04:38.634
<v Speaker 4>you shift consciously through breath </v>
<v Speaker 4>into that simple parasympathetic state </v>

1389
01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.290
<v Speaker 4>that becomes trainable.</v>

1390
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:44.123
<v Speaker 4>You can do that over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then all it takes is just a couple of </v>

1391
01:04:46.021 --> 01:04:47.970
<v Speaker 4>deep breaths in your back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1392
01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:50.160
<v Speaker 4>Because you train that the fucking body </v>
<v Speaker 4>remembers,</v>

1393
01:04:50.161 --> 01:04:54.480
<v Speaker 4>the brain remembers and when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>those states that shifts everything from</v>

1394
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:56.670
<v Speaker 4>the neurochemical response to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brainwave state.</v>

1395
01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.460
<v Speaker 4>You can drop from Beta into Alpha into </v>
<v Speaker 4>theta.</v>

1396
01:05:00.810 --> 01:05:02.340
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1397
01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:04.043
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy to think what we understand </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the various pathways these </v>

1398
01:05:07.861 --> 01:05:12.300
<v Speaker 4>chemicals have to go through and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>what is like still confusing?</v>

1399
01:05:12.810 --> 01:05:14.310
<v Speaker 4>Like here's the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's the,</v>

1400
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.440
<v Speaker 4>where's the consciousness coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1401
01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:18.190
<v Speaker 4>How does it all become the thing</v>

1402
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.023
<v Speaker 2>that's looking through Kyle Kingsbury's </v>
<v Speaker 2>eyes and seeing me in mind looking at </v>

1403
01:05:22.061 --> 01:05:25.750
<v Speaker 2>you w w what's exactly what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that thing?</v>

1404
01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:28.990
<v Speaker 2>What is that thing that seems to be like</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost like a,</v>

1405
01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.040
<v Speaker 2>like an energy that runs through this </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

1406
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:36.760
<v Speaker 2>It's through fucking everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in all things,</v>

1407
01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:37.863
<v Speaker 2>but if we thought about it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you'd be so much more concerned </v>

1408
01:05:41.111 --> 01:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>with keeping that energy high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1409
01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of what,</v>

1410
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:47.580
<v Speaker 2>what people experience when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1411
01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:50.950
<v Speaker 2>the word depression,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is their life going?</v>

1412
01:05:50.951 --> 01:05:54.430
<v Speaker 2>Bad tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor health,</v>

1413
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:56.463
<v Speaker 2>bad job choices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much of it is some sort of a weird </v>

1414
01:05:59.741 --> 01:06:01.600
<v Speaker 2>genetic thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much,</v>

1415
01:06:01.601 --> 01:06:05.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's so many variables as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>what causes depression,</v>

1416
01:06:05.021 --> 01:06:09.460
<v Speaker 2>but such a giant number of people suffer</v>
<v Speaker 2>from depression.</v>

1417
01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:10.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

1418
01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:13.000
<v Speaker 2>I think it only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm being honest,</v>

1419
01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I think it's going to get worse.</v>

1420
01:06:14.380 --> 01:06:17.050
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you look at the way we live and the</v>

1421
01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:17.943
<v Speaker 2>closer and closer you've spoken about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were just talking about fucking </v>

1422
01:06:19.751 --> 01:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not meant to be that confined.</v>

1423
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:26.320
<v Speaker 2>We're not meant to sit out like with </v>
<v Speaker 2>were withheld from the fucking sun right</v>

1424
01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many of these things communicate with</v>

1425
01:06:28.421 --> 01:06:31.000
<v Speaker 2>our bodies and working with a genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialist ran for singer,</v>

1426
01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:31.834
<v Speaker 2>he was on Chris Ryan show sunlight </v>
<v Speaker 2>influences 500 on off switches on our </v>

1427
01:06:37.601 --> 01:06:40.420
<v Speaker 2>epigenetic level for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the good,</v>

1428
01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.040
<v Speaker 2>unless you fucking overdo it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1429
01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:47.430
<v Speaker 2>500 500 plus on off switches in our DNA </v>
<v Speaker 2>are affected by sunlight positively,</v>

1430
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:49.683
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

1431
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:52.210
<v Speaker 2>they look at vitamin D three takes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1432
01:06:52.211 --> 01:06:55.560
<v Speaker 2>they're calling that a hormone now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a fucking vitamin real is,</v>

1433
01:06:55.561 --> 01:06:56.394
<v Speaker 2>it's a messenger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how much it influences in the </v>

1434
01:06:57.941 --> 01:06:59.770
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredibly important.</v>

1435
01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.010
<v Speaker 2>So when you think about all these things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like being barefoot,</v>

1436
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.560
<v Speaker 2>being connected to the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going in the fucking ocean,</v>

1437
01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:10.720
<v Speaker 2>science will catch up in certain ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we get fixated on the thing.</v>

1438
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:13.120
<v Speaker 2>We get fixed and it fixated on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>phones,</v>

1439
01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.930
<v Speaker 2>on whatever TV is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're closed off from other people.</v>

1440
01:07:16.931 --> 01:07:17.681
<v Speaker 2>We think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1441
01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:21.370
<v Speaker 2>communicating through facebook is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same as being fucking face to face.</v>

1442
01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1443
01:07:22.731 --> 01:07:25.420
<v Speaker 2>and the more we head that direction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're putting,</v>

1444
01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:26.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you put it,</v>

1445
01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:27.334
<v Speaker 2>put in fucking shit food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In our body from mouth pleasure that </v>

1446
01:07:29.081 --> 01:07:31.270
<v Speaker 2>influences the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1447
01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:32.133
<v Speaker 2>80 to 90% of all of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitters are made by the </v>

1448
01:07:34.061 --> 01:07:34.894
<v Speaker 2>bacteria in our gut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think the shit meals just going </v>

1449
01:07:36.961 --> 01:07:38.440
<v Speaker 2>to put on five pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1450
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:40.810
<v Speaker 2>It might put on five pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to fuck your brain up for</v>

1451
01:07:40.811 --> 01:07:43.120
<v Speaker 2>a while.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make you a little bit more emotional</v>

1452
01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:44.260
<v Speaker 2>fuck with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1453
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:46.420
<v Speaker 2>your sharpness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your memory recall,</v>

1454
01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.940
<v Speaker 2>all that's impacted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleeps impacted.</v>

1455
01:07:49.270 --> 01:07:50.103
<v Speaker 2>I wish Michael Walker talked a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that and it's don't think it's in </v>

1456
01:07:52.421 --> 01:07:53.920
<v Speaker 2>his wheelhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it is.</v>

1457
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:55.600
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just to go studies,</v>

1458
01:07:55.601 --> 01:07:56.434
<v Speaker 2>sleep and the effects on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But fuck was that in illuminating </v>

1459
01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.400
<v Speaker 2>eyeopening podcasts was so important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

1460
01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:06.700
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his book is really good,</v>

1461
01:08:06.701 --> 01:08:07.534
<v Speaker 2>but as far as like dialing in sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more of this is what happens when </v>

1462
01:08:11.651 --> 01:08:13.480
<v Speaker 2>you don't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sleep,</v>

1463
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:14.410
<v Speaker 2>the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep by Nick.</v>

1464
01:08:14.411 --> 01:08:16.070
<v Speaker 2>Little Hales is probably my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

1465
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.903
<v Speaker 4>that gives you all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking how to guide on how to </v>

1466
01:08:18.771 --> 01:08:22.520
<v Speaker 4>maximize sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you were younger,</v>

1467
01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:25.220
<v Speaker 4>lack of sleep didn't affect you the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>it affects you now,</v>

1468
01:08:25.221 --> 01:08:26.300
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

1469
01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything he talks about like the,</v>

1470
01:08:28.031 --> 01:08:28.864
<v Speaker 4>would that shift that you have that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens in adolescence where you become </v>

1471
01:08:30.891 --> 01:08:32.780
<v Speaker 4>a night owl?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No doubt.</v>

1472
01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:33.913
<v Speaker 4>And I probably still could stay out a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit later until having a kid and </v>

1473
01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:38.600
<v Speaker 4>then that's your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your immediate reset bitch.</v>

1474
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:41.630
<v Speaker 4>You're getting up when the sun comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1475
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.830
<v Speaker 4>Be prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sir.</v>

1476
01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.740
<v Speaker 4>Get ready.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1477
01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:46.603
<v Speaker 4>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many different factors that </v>

1478
01:08:48.711 --> 01:08:49.544
<v Speaker 4>lead to a healthy body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how much of a healthy body leads to </v>

1479
01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:53.264
<v Speaker 4>a happy mind?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where it gets like you can't </v>

1480
01:08:55.221 --> 01:08:58.760
<v Speaker 4>blame some of these people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>suffering from like a disease.</v>

1481
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:01.580
<v Speaker 4>Some of these people that have like </v>
<v Speaker 4>something wrong with the way their brain</v>

1482
01:09:01.581 --> 01:09:03.740
<v Speaker 4>is producing these happy hormones.</v>

1483
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:06.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you can say it's just this</v>
<v Speaker 4>one thing like,</v>

1484
01:09:06.471 --> 01:09:09.560
<v Speaker 4>well if you just eat clean or if you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just went keto or Paleo,</v>

1485
01:09:09.561 --> 01:09:11.660
<v Speaker 4>then you wouldn't have depression.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's it at all.</v>

1486
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:12.494
<v Speaker 4>But certainly that's a factor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's certainly could be a fact being in </v>

1487

<v Speaker 4>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being in nature as a fact and unpacking </v>

1578
01:12:59.881 --> 01:13:00.714
<v Speaker 4>a mild stimulant.</v>

1579

<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1608
01:14:16.001 --> 01:14:17.830
<v Speaker 4>I felt fucking great that one time I </v>
<v Speaker 4>tried it.</v>

1609
01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.810
<v Speaker 4>I tried to,</v>

1613
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:29.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it went bad drugs.</v>

1614
01:14:29.230 --> 01:14:30.760
<v Speaker 4>I want to tell people how to do good </v>
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>

1615
01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:31.803
<v Speaker 4>Why would you a snort it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause it goes right into your </v>

1616
01:14:33.161 --> 01:14:34.210
<v Speaker 4>bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1617
01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.100
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can suck at that time.</v>

1618
01:14:36.101 --> 01:14:37.000
<v Speaker 4>Release,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crush it up,</v>

1619
01:14:37.001 --> 01:14:38.350
<v Speaker 4>let it dry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1620
01:14:38.410 --> 01:14:40.060
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that ultimately that was like,</v>

1621
01:14:40.061 --> 01:14:40.510
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1622
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:41.343
<v Speaker 4>there's still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thankfully I still have this fucking </v>

1623
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:44.073
<v Speaker 4>regulator on my body that says don't put</v>
<v Speaker 4>these fucking super addictive manmade </v>

1624
01:14:47.111 --> 01:14:49.180
<v Speaker 4>chemicals in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fascinating.</v>

1625
01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:52.900
<v Speaker 4>Do you think it's create a manmade,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was sort of a plant,</v>

1626
01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:53.740
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is plant based.</v>

1627
01:14:53.741 --> 01:14:54.574
<v Speaker 4>I mean all this shit's plant based.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The issue is when we take something and </v>

1628
01:14:56.691 --> 01:14:57.524
<v Speaker 4>we fucking concentrate it and change it </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way to where it just really has an </v>

1629
01:15:01.541 --> 01:15:02.374
<v Speaker 4>affinity for receptors and we lose out </v>
<v Speaker 4>on all these other alkaloids and </v>

1630
01:15:05.141 --> 01:15:08.950
<v Speaker 4>turpines and things like look at marinol</v>
<v Speaker 4>versus whole plant cannabis.</v>

1631
01:15:09.010 --> 01:15:09.843
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1632
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:12.670
<v Speaker 4>Fucking bulk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they take this stuff and then turn it</v>

1633
01:15:12.671 --> 01:15:16.210
<v Speaker 4>into an actual drug that they sell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're only going to sell parts of it,</v>

1634
01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:16.730
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1635
01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:17.563
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're selling the active ingredient </v>

1636
01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:19.203
<v Speaker 4>like cocaine versus fucking coca leaf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally different experience and it was </v>

1637
01:15:22.711 --> 01:15:25.120
<v Speaker 4>ever had coca tea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have had coca tea.</v>

1638
01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:26.650
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've thrown coca leaf.</v>

1639
01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:27.484
<v Speaker 4>This is called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they call it Mommy and Columbia and you </v>

1640
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:29.500
<v Speaker 4>chew it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chew.</v>

1641
01:15:29.501 --> 01:15:31.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is it an amazing,</v>

1642
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:34.000
<v Speaker 4>it's like a cup of coffee though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like less jittery,</v>

1643
01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.190
<v Speaker 4>your brain turns on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a nootropic.</v>

1644
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:39.130
<v Speaker 4>You feel like 1 million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We can't catch it</v>

1645
01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:43.750
<v Speaker 3>because in Miami [inaudible] they fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>us all their,</v>

1646
01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:46.820
<v Speaker 3>their whole city's made out of coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1647
01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:48.490
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1648
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:49.950
<v Speaker 3>no dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1649
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:51.840
<v Speaker 3>have you ever seen cocaine cowboys?</v>

1652
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:58.030
<v Speaker 3>that area of Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're one point at one point in time,</v>

1653
01:15:58.031 --> 01:16:01.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's still the case,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Miami had more banks per capita than</v>

1654
01:16:01.481 --> 01:16:04.780
<v Speaker 3>any place else in the country because </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody is just laundry and Koch money</v>

1655
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.793
<v Speaker 3>and coke is just coming in like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many great documentaries on </v>

1656
01:16:08.411 --> 01:16:09.041
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really,</v>

1657
01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:12.820
<v Speaker 3>really fascinating time in like history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like during cocaine.</v>

1658
01:16:12.821 --> 01:16:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Cowboys wants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shout out to Billy Corbin,</v>

1659
01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:19.210
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first one they talked about how many</v>

1660
01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.613
<v Speaker 3>of these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>police officer's wound up dead or in </v>

1661
01:16:23.261 --> 01:16:24.094
<v Speaker 3>jail and it was like an entire class </v>
<v Speaker 3>graduating class either was dead or in </v>

1662
01:16:30.191 --> 01:16:32.190
<v Speaker 3>jail for corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1663
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:34.300
<v Speaker 3>but it's something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1664
01:16:34.301 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 3>they had made this a look at this time </v>
<v Speaker 3>period,</v>

1665
01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:41.530
<v Speaker 3>however many years it was a of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine trafficking.</v>

1666
01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:42.553
<v Speaker 3>Who's crazy man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's a incredible time and like </v>

1667
01:16:46.721 --> 01:16:49.270
<v Speaker 3>human history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ben,</v>

1668
01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:50.793
<v Speaker 3>this article,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it says that it's ramped back up to </v>

1669
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:57.070
<v Speaker 3>those 1980s drug war heights of </v>
<v Speaker 3>production.</v>

1670
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:58.330
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1671
01:16:58.330 --> 01:16:59.320
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so how's it getting in?</v>

1672
01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:01.220
<v Speaker 4>That's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1673
01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:03.700
<v Speaker 4>How are they getting it in?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's a problem.</v>

1674
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:04.683
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it is either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But how are they doing it and how do </v>

1675
01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:07.451
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1676
01:17:07.451 --> 01:17:11.150
<v Speaker 4>that's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why are you so much of that money?</v>

1677
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:14.630
<v Speaker 4>So much money in it that what it costs </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

1678
01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:18.980
<v Speaker 4>Florida customs and border protection </v>
<v Speaker 4>confiscated 4,200</v>

1679
01:17:18.981 --> 01:17:23.240
<v Speaker 4>pounds of cocaine last year compared to </v>
<v Speaker 4>1,730</v>

1680
01:17:23.241 --> 01:17:27.770
<v Speaker 4>pounds the year prior to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it means the guy,</v>

1681
01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 4>the guy that was getting paid off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>year before it got caught,</v>

1682
01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.310
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How else are they getting it in?</v>

1683
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:35.383
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they just caught more coke the </v>

1684
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:37.963
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're getting coked up and then </v>

1685
01:17:38.871 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 4>they're taking the boats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just take risks.</v>

1686
01:17:42.380 --> 01:17:43.213
<v Speaker 4>I know where these fucking cops hide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know them better than they know </v>

1687
01:17:45.771 --> 01:17:46.604
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've never seen cocaine production at </v>

1688
01:17:48.951 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 4>these numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1689
01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:53.270
<v Speaker 4>Stay the fuck out of Miami for a while </v>
<v Speaker 4>folks.</v>

1690
01:17:53.271 --> 01:17:55.850
<v Speaker 4>It could get crazy or go there or go </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1691
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:56.990
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked the way you think,</v>

1692
01:17:56.991 --> 01:17:58.190
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>into the fray.</v>

1693
01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where's the party?</v>

1694
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:01.813
<v Speaker 4>Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the DEA estimates Columbia produce 710 </v>

1695
01:18:05.451 --> 01:18:10.451
<v Speaker 4>tons of pure cocaine last year or enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>to fill about 18 semi trucks.</v>

1696
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:18.850
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you see that a so crazy.</v>

1697
01:18:18.851 --> 01:18:20.990
<v Speaker 4>They found the first coca farm in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexico.</v>

1698
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.570
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That can be a problem.</v>

1699
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:24.423
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well it actually might help with the </v>

1700
01:18:26.061 --> 01:18:29.120
<v Speaker 4>drug wars really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they can grow it and they can't fight</v>

1701
01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:30.410
<v Speaker 4>against each other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't grow it.</v>

1702
01:18:30.411 --> 01:18:31.244
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mexicans in Columbia has been fighting </v>

1703
01:18:32.001 --> 01:18:32.834
<v Speaker 4>for a long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they would start fighting with each </v>

1704
01:18:34.071 --> 01:18:34.904
<v Speaker 4>other and that would help the drug war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would fight less because Mexico </v>

1705
01:18:37.191 --> 01:18:41.930
<v Speaker 4>would have its own production.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean they said it was growing in a</v>

1706
01:18:41.931 --> 01:18:44.990
<v Speaker 4>place that wasn't the same altitude and </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously cocaine,</v>

1707
01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:49.880
<v Speaker 4>it's an alkaloid that is really it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It grows at altitude,</v>

1708
01:18:49.881 --> 01:18:53.750
<v Speaker 4>so you want that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that environmental stimulus for that.</v>

1709
01:18:53.751 --> 01:18:54.584
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want the hormetic stressor in order </v>

1710
01:18:55.401 --> 01:18:58.190
<v Speaker 4>for it to produce more cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pound for pound,</v>

1711
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:59.930
<v Speaker 4>and I think it would produce far less </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1712
01:18:59.931 --> 01:19:01.730
<v Speaker 4>That's at least what they were saying in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the article,</v>

1713
01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:02.960
<v Speaker 4>which makes sense to me.</v>

1714
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:05.683
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the justification for what does </v>

1715
01:19:07.471 --> 01:19:10.010
<v Speaker 4>this Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we show how they're getting it in.</v>

1716
01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:13.980
<v Speaker 4>I says speedboats chuck mills and on </v>
<v Speaker 4>poor old lady.</v>

1717
01:19:13.981 --> 01:19:15.960
<v Speaker 4>Look at this poor old lady.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's holding the kilos.</v>

1718
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:17.970
<v Speaker 4>She looks like she's about seven years </v>
<v Speaker 4>old,</v>

1719
01:19:18.690 --> 01:19:20.460
<v Speaker 4>maybe older,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe eight years old.</v>

1720
01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 4>And she's fully strapped up with </v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine.</v>

1721
01:19:23.690 --> 01:19:24.630
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who could,</v>

1722
01:19:24.660 --> 01:19:27.240
<v Speaker 4>who could blame this lady?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think she's out there hustling?</v>

1723
01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:31.740
<v Speaker 4>She got a pistol in people's faces.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're the shine that that's fucked up.</v>

1724
01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:33.443
<v Speaker 4>That's fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we need more good drugs and less bad </v>

1725
01:19:37.051 --> 01:19:40.080
<v Speaker 4>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We definitely need more good drugs.</v>

1726
01:19:40.081 --> 01:19:40.914
<v Speaker 4>We need to do something to get this does</v>
<v Speaker 4>wave of negativity that so many people </v>

1727
01:19:48.691 --> 01:19:49.524
<v Speaker 4>are experiencing on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you settle that down and bring that </v>

1728
01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:54.330
<v Speaker 4>up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know anybody that's done ketamine</v>

1729
01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:55.650
<v Speaker 4>treatment?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1730
01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.080
<v Speaker 4>And pretty good results,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1731
01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.710
<v Speaker 4>Neil Brennan had very good results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He liked it quite a bit.</v>

1732
01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.060
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1733
01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.670
<v Speaker 4>he's done a bunch of different things </v>
<v Speaker 4>for depression,</v>

1734
01:20:05.671 --> 01:20:07.920
<v Speaker 4>magnetic things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ketamine things.</v>

1735
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

1736
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.940
<v Speaker 2>said Ketamine was very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1737
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.580
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my first coaches,</v>

1738
01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.460
<v Speaker 2>a striking coach,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had,</v>

1739
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd been put on every kind of fucking </v>

1740
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:17.903
<v Speaker 2>Ssri for years and just felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did for Ketamine treatments and </v>

1741
01:20:22.801 --> 01:20:27.540
<v Speaker 2>he's down to like one Ssri off 90% of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his medication.</v>

1742
01:20:27.541 --> 01:20:29.790
<v Speaker 2>He said he's never felt better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that,</v>

1743
01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:30.624
<v Speaker 2>that shitty voice that everyone has in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their head that was so loud for him is </v>

1744
01:20:33.631 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 2>nonexistent now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1745
01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to do that.</v>

1746
01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:37.734
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Craig put us through a slightly </v>

1747
01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:40.980
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the people that I think that are</v>

1748
01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:41.814
<v Speaker 2>doing ketamine treatment do at Ivy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had an intramuscular injection of </v>

1749
01:20:44.671 --> 01:20:46.830
<v Speaker 2>ketamine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the John Lilly.</v>

1750
01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:50.430
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 40 minutes long.</v>

1751
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was kind of tied in with the stem</v>

1752
01:20:54.241 --> 01:20:58.920
<v Speaker 2>cells really to just be in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>allowing and whatever subconscious level</v>

1753
01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:00.960
<v Speaker 2>of accepting this foreign substance into</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body.</v>

1754
01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's kind of move the needle on that.</v>

1755
01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's theory.</v>

1756
01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the experience like?</v>

1757
01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:07.570
<v Speaker 2>What it's a psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>

1758
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:08.730
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's different.</v>

1759
01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:10.170
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about the,</v>

1760
01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:11.004
<v Speaker 2>the classical types tryptamine base </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to fit in serotonin receptors in </v>

1761
01:21:13.921 --> 01:21:15.670
<v Speaker 2>different parts of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1762
01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:19.770
<v Speaker 2>this is a dissociative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it pulls you back layers,</v>

1763
01:21:19.771 --> 01:21:20.604
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we talked about Eckhart toll last </v>

1764
01:21:21.541 --> 01:21:22.890
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how he talks,</v>

1765
01:21:22.891 --> 01:21:25.230
<v Speaker 2>be the observer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the witness of your thoughts.</v>

1766
01:21:25.231 --> 01:21:28.020
<v Speaker 2>You're not your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just pull yourself back a layer and kind</v>

1767
01:21:28.021 --> 01:21:31.440
<v Speaker 2>of see your mind chatter as this </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting thing like kids arguing,</v>

1768
01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will force that.</v>

1769
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:36.390
<v Speaker 2>And it pulls you back layers beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1770
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.510
<v Speaker 2>Like to the point where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1771
01:21:39.511 --> 01:21:42.240
<v Speaker 2>you're not in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you reenter your body,</v>

1772
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:45.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of gratitude and you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of see things where they are,</v>

1773
01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:46.291
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1774
01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:47.940
<v Speaker 2>you understand now like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1775
01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:49.433
<v Speaker 2>this is how I was feeling before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been removed from it long </v>

1776
01:21:51.541 --> 01:21:54.600
<v Speaker 2>enough to when I come back to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can recognize it for what it is.</v>

1777
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't have depression now,</v>

1778
01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.810
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So doing it was,</v>

1779
01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:01.800
<v Speaker 2>it was just more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see what happens,</v>

1780
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:02.663
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of kind of intention as opposed to </v>

1781
01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:07.140
<v Speaker 2>like people that are going in there </v>
<v Speaker 2>working on shit might be a bit different</v>

1782
01:22:07.141 --> 01:22:09.150
<v Speaker 2>for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was fucking bananas.</v>

1783
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:11.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never talked to,</v>

1784
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.653
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew a guy who got addicted to it </v>

1785
01:22:13.771 --> 01:22:14.220
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

1786
01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.200
<v Speaker 2>as a street drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a party drug.</v>

1787
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:18.070
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people have snorted half's in order</v>

1788
01:22:18.071 --> 01:22:18.904
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1789
01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:20.280
<v Speaker 2>What does it do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1790
01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.480
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1791
01:22:21.481 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like lsd.</v>

1792
01:22:22.621 --> 01:22:23.454
<v Speaker 2>You have a microdose Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different experience than a </v>

1793
01:22:25.651 --> 01:22:29.730
<v Speaker 2>full hid or two to five to whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all different experiences,</v>

1794
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:31.283
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take like a key bomp a key bump </v>

1795
01:22:32.821 --> 01:22:33.654
<v Speaker 2>for people with a lack of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terminology would just be like the end </v>

1796
01:22:36.481 --> 01:22:40.670
<v Speaker 2>of a keys worth a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just curl,</v>

1797
01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.840
<v Speaker 2>snort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

1798
01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 2>it's very relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to move.</v>

1799
01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:46.494
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you push the envelope a little bit </v>

1800
01:22:48.270 --> 01:22:51.630
<v Speaker 2>because it's disuse disassociated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very disorienting.</v>

1801
01:22:51.631 --> 01:22:52.464
<v Speaker 2>Like you can like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where the fuck I am or </v>

1802
01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:55.350
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some,</v>

1803
01:22:55.351 --> 01:22:57.700
<v Speaker 2>if you go really far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1804
01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.553
<v Speaker 2>it's similar to injecting it where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>go in the k hole and you're kind of </v>

1805
01:23:00.511 --> 01:23:03.360
<v Speaker 2>paralyzed and close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in a different spot.</v>

1806
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:05.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in a spot.</v>

1807
01:23:05.591 --> 01:23:06.340
<v Speaker 2>But the psychedelic</v>

1808
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:07.780
<v Speaker 4>trip from that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were in a different spot.</v>

1809
01:23:07.781 --> 01:23:09.850
<v Speaker 4>Like you're in a different place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like psychedelic.</v>

1810
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1811
01:23:10.841 --> 01:23:11.740
<v Speaker 4>Like you could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1812
01:23:11.741 --> 01:23:13.600
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for 30 to 45 minutes,</v>

1813
01:23:13.601 --> 01:23:15.280
<v Speaker 4>you could be in a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1814
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:19.150
<v Speaker 4>you could be elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your consciousness is not in your body.</v>

1815
01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:22.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the key.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1816
01:23:22.451 --> 01:23:24.280
<v Speaker 4>That's the key hole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:25.383
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy who invented the sensory </v>

1818
01:23:26.471 --> 01:23:27.304
<v Speaker 4>deprivation tank used to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>intramuscularly and then climate of the </v>

1819
01:23:29.621 --> 01:23:30.550
<v Speaker 4>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1820
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:33.850
<v Speaker 4>I heard that he had a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at one point by the end,</v>

1821
01:23:33.851 --> 01:23:34.684
<v Speaker 4>he was so hooked on it that he would run</v>
<v Speaker 4>an ivy so he could stay on 24 hours in </v>

1822
01:23:38.021 --> 01:23:39.040
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1823
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:40.840
<v Speaker 4>I was telling you about that book that </v>
<v Speaker 4>he wrote,</v>

1824
01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:42.400
<v Speaker 4>the center of the cyclone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:44.680
<v Speaker 4>That was a fucking fascinating book </v>
<v Speaker 4>because he would,</v>

1826
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:47.200
<v Speaker 4>he would get as a medical doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>300,</v>

1827
01:23:47.850 --> 01:23:48.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd get any pupils,</v>

1828
01:23:48.881 --> 01:23:53.320
<v Speaker 4>a 300 Iq from Sandoz pharmaceuticals of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pharmaceutical grade lsd.</v>

1829
01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Do that intravenous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then get in the float tank for 10 hours.</v>

1830
01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:59.920
<v Speaker 4>And the trip reports he has,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you read these,</v>

1831
01:23:59.921 --> 01:24:04.150
<v Speaker 4>they're very IOWASCA s like talking to </v>
<v Speaker 4>other beings and other consciousness,</v>

1832
01:24:04.151 --> 01:24:07.090
<v Speaker 4>dmt like experience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but 10 hours,</v>

1833
01:24:07.091 --> 01:24:11.060
<v Speaker 4>not fucking 15 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And just fascinating like he's,</v>

1834
01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:11.913
<v Speaker 4>and as a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so with detailed in his ex explanation </v>

1835
01:24:15.101 --> 01:24:17.020
<v Speaker 4>of what he's seeing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it means to him.</v>

1836
01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:18.603
<v Speaker 4>Pretty fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's an experience that once you </v>

1837
01:24:22.631 --> 01:24:25.690
<v Speaker 4>know that you can have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that if I,</v>

1838
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:26.583
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have a real hard time fitting </v>

1839
01:24:29.891 --> 01:24:34.810
<v Speaker 4>into regular life if I knew that I could</v>
<v Speaker 4>just have that 10 hours,</v>

1840
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.840
<v Speaker 4>like the DMT flash of 15 minutes of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>weirdest interactions with whatever they</v>

1841
01:24:40.961 --> 01:24:42.520
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever those things are.</v>

1842
01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.990
<v Speaker 4>When you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>imagine that for 10 hours it might,</v>

1843
01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:51.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>invite like just change everything about</v>

1844
01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:52.120
<v Speaker 4>your perceptions of life.</v>

1845
01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:56.020
<v Speaker 4>You might just give up on civilization </v>
<v Speaker 4>and move to the forest or something.</v>

1846
01:24:56.021 --> 01:24:56.854
<v Speaker 4>You might,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's exactly what happened to the </v>

1847
01:24:57.881 --> 01:25:00.100
<v Speaker 4>unabomber.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The unabomber was a part of the,</v>

1848
01:25:00.130 --> 01:25:02.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Harvard lsd studies.</v>

1849
01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:03.513
<v Speaker 4>They'd juice that guy to the tits dam </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then afterwards he went to be a </v>

1850
01:25:08.501 --> 01:25:09.334
<v Speaker 4>professor at Berkeley so he could save </v>
<v Speaker 4>up enough money so he could buy a </v>

1851
01:25:12.791 --> 01:25:13.624
<v Speaker 4>fucking house in the woods and blow up </v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that are creating technology </v>

1852
01:25:16.331 --> 01:25:19.090
<v Speaker 4>because the technology is what's going </v>
<v Speaker 4>to supplant human beings.</v>

1853
01:25:19.091 --> 01:25:19.924
<v Speaker 4>It's gonna gonna take over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You serve our position on earth or some </v>

1854
01:25:22.391 --> 01:25:24.820
<v Speaker 4>crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he just decided he was going to kill</v>

1855
01:25:24.821 --> 01:25:27.790
<v Speaker 4>all these fucking scientists and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>remembered that and he was like,</v>

1856
01:25:27.940 --> 01:25:28.773
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

1857
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.943
<v Speaker 4>that's an odd take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a different take on technology in </v>

1858
01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:36.430
<v Speaker 4>a Iowasca ceremony where I saw pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>much what's happening now.</v>

1859
01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:39.520
<v Speaker 4>It was like this beautiful merging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't man left behind.</v>

1860
01:25:39.521 --> 01:25:40.354
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't super intelligence with Nick </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bostrom where we have to worry about </v>

1861
01:25:42.521 --> 01:25:43.354
<v Speaker 4>this thing's taking over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we fucking stayed neck and neck </v>

1862
01:25:45.041 --> 01:25:49.000
<v Speaker 4>with it and integrate with it throughout</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we do change.</v>

1863
01:25:49.001 --> 01:25:51.190
<v Speaker 4>We're not the fucking same,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're not the same now.</v>

1864
01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:52.570
<v Speaker 4>That's the one of the things they talked</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

1865
01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:56.620
<v Speaker 4>like who's the first Cyborg eyeglasses?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You weren't fucking eyeglasses.</v>

1866
01:25:56.621 --> 01:25:57.454
<v Speaker 4>You're a fucking Cyborg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's manmade technology integrated </v>

1867
01:25:59.831 --> 01:26:02.110
<v Speaker 4>into your being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That changes your perception of reality.</v>

1868
01:26:02.170 --> 01:26:03.040
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

1869
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:05.270
<v Speaker 4>so we're already doing that with our </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking phones.</v>

1870
01:26:05.271 --> 01:26:06.500
<v Speaker 4>We're already,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're already there.</v>

1871
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:08.060
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he cars,</v>

1872
01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.433
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had this weird idea that it has to </v>

1873
01:26:10.281 --> 01:26:12.650
<v Speaker 4>be implanted into you in order for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be the case.</v>

1874
01:26:12.651 --> 01:26:14.420
<v Speaker 4>We're already fucking there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1875
01:26:14.421 --> 01:26:18.860
<v Speaker 4>we're there both with the connection </v>
<v Speaker 4>with this thing.</v>

1876
01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 4>It's always in our pocket.</v>

1877
01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:20.713
<v Speaker 4>And then with transportation and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>transportation hooks up to the </v>

1878
01:26:23.091 --> 01:26:25.610
<v Speaker 4>connection so you can listen to things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1879
01:26:25.611 --> 01:26:25.971
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1880
01:26:25.971 --> 01:26:27.080
<v Speaker 4>how many times you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in your car,</v>

1881
01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 4>listen to a book on tape through </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bluetooth,</v>

1882
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:30.800
<v Speaker 4>you know our or podcasts that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>download.</v>

1883
01:26:30.980 --> 01:26:32.330
<v Speaker 4>That's everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Aubrey.</v>

1884
01:26:32.331 --> 01:26:36.920
<v Speaker 4>Aubrey ties a chapter in his book on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>day on that mindfulness or mindfulness.</v>

1885
01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:37.993
<v Speaker 4>So when you're driving like what's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>worst part of fucking most people's </v>

1886
01:26:40.011 --> 01:26:41.240
<v Speaker 4>days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the commute,</v>

1887
01:26:41.241 --> 01:26:41.870
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1888
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:45.290
<v Speaker 4>So you can choose to be pissed off guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can listen to talk radio,</v>

1889
01:26:45.291 --> 01:26:46.124
<v Speaker 4>you can do all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or you can practice mindfulness </v>

1890
01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 4>meditation where you're resetting </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1891
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:53.150
<v Speaker 4>You're giving yourself some quiet time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously eyes are open while your hands</v>

1892
01:26:53.151 --> 01:26:53.984
<v Speaker 4>are on the wheel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you do mindfulness where you fucking </v>

1893
01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:56.684
<v Speaker 4>throw on a dope podcast or a book from </v>
<v Speaker 4>audible and you would take information </v>

1894
01:27:00.981 --> 01:27:03.470
<v Speaker 4>in that's going to help you fucking grow</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a person,</v>

1895
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:04.363
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1896
01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.730
<v Speaker 4>It can be into entertaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I enjoy fictional books.</v>

1897
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.880
<v Speaker 4>I like some fiction on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on audio books,</v>

1898
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:13.380
<v Speaker 4>which is its function.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what,</v>

1899
01:27:13.381 --> 01:27:15.050
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Stephen King books,</v>

1900
01:27:15.051 --> 01:27:15.884
<v Speaker 4>but I do not like it when he reads them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need the high royer a fucking </v>

1901
01:27:19.191 --> 01:27:20.660
<v Speaker 4>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit.</v>

1902
01:27:21.480 --> 01:27:23.390
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like the author,</v>

1903
01:27:23.690 --> 01:27:24.523
<v Speaker 4>the author of these delays.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading the tipping point from a </v>

1904
01:27:27.021 --> 01:27:27.854
<v Speaker 4>Mountain Malcolm Gladwell and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>hearing him do the audio part is great </v>

1905
01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:34.213
<v Speaker 4>because he's very passionate about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>subject matter and he's the guy that </v>

1906
01:27:36.711 --> 01:27:41.450
<v Speaker 4>wrote it and so him re reading out these</v>
<v Speaker 4>results in all these different facts and</v>

1907
01:27:41.451 --> 01:27:44.500
<v Speaker 4>really fascinating things about the </v>
<v Speaker 4>tipping point and you know,</v>

1908
01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.870
<v Speaker 4>certain trends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it Stephen King is like,</v>

1909
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:50.360
<v Speaker 4>he's a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant writer.</v>

1910
01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:52.160
<v Speaker 4>Like one of my favorite writers for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1911
01:27:52.161 --> 01:27:54.800
<v Speaker 4>My favorite horror writer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I loved a shit.</v>

1912
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:55.663
<v Speaker 4>Like I used to read him when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>taking the train to go to taekwondo </v>

1913
01:27:58.641 --> 01:27:59.060
<v Speaker 4>practice.</v>

1914
01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.090
<v Speaker 4>I would read Stephen King books all day </v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

1915
01:28:01.091 --> 01:28:01.924
<v Speaker 4>That's all I would read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was always a giant fan is but as a </v>

1916
01:28:06.141 --> 01:28:09.140
<v Speaker 4>professional actor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perhaps doing more spirited job,</v>

1917
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:12.960
<v Speaker 4>I've had some fucking bad actors on </v>
<v Speaker 4>audible.</v>

1918
01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That gets a bad ones like radio host,</v>

1919
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:16.783
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in the next chapter we're going to </v>

1920
01:28:18.231 --> 01:28:22.850
<v Speaker 4>tell you why it advanced glycation end </v>
<v Speaker 4>products are the devil and you're like,</v>

1921
01:28:22.851 --> 01:28:24.800
<v Speaker 4>fuck off dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just,</v>

1922
01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:26.120
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it ruins it for me.</v>

1923
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:28.100
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when telling a story,</v>

1924
01:28:28.190 --> 01:28:29.023
<v Speaker 4>this is my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need someone who has a very good </v>

1925
01:28:33.621 --> 01:28:38.090
<v Speaker 4>sense of theater.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the way they communicate the words,</v>

1926
01:28:38.091 --> 01:28:39.350
<v Speaker 4>the way they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the words,</v>

1927
01:28:39.351 --> 01:28:41.870
<v Speaker 4>the emphasis they put on each individual</v>
<v Speaker 4>word.</v>

1928
01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:44.210
<v Speaker 4>Especially with fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really important.</v>

1929
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:45.283
<v Speaker 4>It's odd to me though that like audible </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't coach them on that because </v>

1930
01:28:47.331 --> 01:28:48.890
<v Speaker 4>everybody was saying when he did the </v>
<v Speaker 4>book,</v>

1931
01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:52.970
<v Speaker 4>he was a King on fucking stop coaching.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if debris.</v>

1932
01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:53.833
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he was reading something they'd be </v>

1933
01:28:54.801 --> 01:28:55.280
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1934
01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.480
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mr Marcus.</v>

1937
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:01.040
<v Speaker 4>It sounds like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>your mind's in a different</v>

1939
01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:04.440
<v Speaker 5>place.</v>

01:29:10.111 --> 01:29:11.130
<v Speaker 5>all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he said it was,</v>

1943
01:29:11.131 --> 01:29:11.964
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe they've changed over time with </v>

1944
01:29:13.471 --> 01:29:14.760
<v Speaker 5>their approach to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>

1945
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:15.721
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

1946
01:29:15.721 --> 01:29:16.554
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably completely different for </v>

1947
01:29:18.271 --> 01:29:19.104
<v Speaker 5>different subject matter.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Aubrey's book is obviously a self help </v>

1948
01:29:20.971 --> 01:29:23.660
<v Speaker 5>book own the day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

1949
01:29:23.670 --> 01:29:28.110
<v Speaker 5>but other books that are stories about </v>
<v Speaker 5>like monsters or some shit like that,</v>

1950
01:29:28.111 --> 01:29:30.810
<v Speaker 5>like what's required of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1951
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:33.450
<v Speaker 5>the guy reading in has to have a sense </v>
<v Speaker 5>of theater.</v>

1952
01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:36.000
<v Speaker 5>He's telling a story has got to be </v>
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>

1953
01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.790
<v Speaker 5>The pause is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>have to be like a professional,</v>

1954
01:29:38.820 --> 01:29:40.390
<v Speaker 5>like a professional voice actor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those are,</v>

1955
01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:41.880
<v Speaker 5>but that's what you want for those </v>
<v Speaker 5>things.</v>

1956
01:29:41.881 --> 01:29:42.900
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're better at it.</v>

1957
01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:45.030
<v Speaker 5>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Stephen King's a wizard at writing.</v>

1958
01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:46.170
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's fucking phenomenal,</v>

1959
01:29:46.171 --> 01:29:49.110
<v Speaker 5>but I don't want to hear him doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>different voices and shit.</v>

1960
01:29:49.111 --> 01:29:50.160
<v Speaker 5>Like it's just too weird.</v>

1961
01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:54.053
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's got a great book though and it's </v>

1962
01:29:54.901 --> 01:29:55.980
<v Speaker 5>great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not just,</v>

1963
01:29:55.981 --> 01:29:57.010
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1964
01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:58.440
<v Speaker 5>for writers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for everybody.</v>

1965
01:29:58.441 --> 01:29:59.274
<v Speaker 5>It's Stephen King on writing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting because it's </v>

1966
01:30:02.191 --> 01:30:03.024
<v Speaker 5>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of his sort of life and </v>

1967
01:30:04.951 --> 01:30:05.784
<v Speaker 5>work philosophy and in the book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I feel like when I read about </v>

1968
01:30:10.321 --> 01:30:12.390
<v Speaker 5>someone who is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion,</v>

1969
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:18.410
<v Speaker 5>one of the greatest contributors to like</v>
<v Speaker 5>fun books and fun horror movies.</v>

1970
01:30:19.261 --> 01:30:23.340
<v Speaker 5>I mean he's the all time king to me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so to be able to say like,</v>

1971
01:30:23.341 --> 01:30:24.100
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what,</v>

1972
01:30:24.100 --> 01:30:26.970
<v Speaker 5>what was going on in that guy's head as </v>
<v Speaker 5>he was writing Carrie?</v>

1973
01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:30.090
<v Speaker 5>Like how did he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how did he conceive of Christine?</v>

1974
01:30:30.091 --> 01:30:31.890
<v Speaker 5>Like what's his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's his process?</v>

1975
01:30:32.100 --> 01:30:35.280
<v Speaker 5>What's his process for writing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting,</v>

1976
01:30:35.281 --> 01:30:35.881
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

1977
01:30:35.881 --> 01:30:37.380
<v Speaker 5>he doesn't even know what the fuck he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>gonna write.</v>

1978
01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:40.710
<v Speaker 5>Like when he starts something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like he doesn't know where he's going.</v>

1979
01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.030
<v Speaker 5>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just does it.</v>

1980
01:30:42.031 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 5>And as he's doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he figures out where it's gonna go.</v>

1981
01:30:44.850 --> 01:30:45.683
<v Speaker 5>Like that's part of the genius of his </v>
<v Speaker 5>method is that it's not like this sort </v>

1982
01:30:49.381 --> 01:30:51.000
<v Speaker 5>of like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1983
01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:51.893
<v Speaker 5>it doesn't have a fucking outlaws.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going to get bit by the snake and </v>

1984
01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:55.530
<v Speaker 5>then Bob's going to turn into a horse </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then,</v>

1985
01:30:55.531 --> 01:30:57.030
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all this stuff's going to happen.</v>

1986
01:30:57.031 --> 01:30:59.370
<v Speaker 5>And then his wife's kind of fall in love</v>
<v Speaker 5>with that horse.</v>

1987
01:30:59.371 --> 01:31:01.320
<v Speaker 5>And then he's going to be mad when it </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes a person again.</v>

1988
01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:02.850
<v Speaker 5>He just goes with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

1989
01:31:02.851 --> 01:31:03.684
<v Speaker 5>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he just,</v>

1990
01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:04.890
<v Speaker 5>he and he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1991
01:31:04.891 --> 01:31:05.724
<v Speaker 5>he just shows up every day and just puts</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the time and focuses on it and then </v>

1992
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:14.970
<v Speaker 5>makes it happen to what a crazy way to </v>
<v Speaker 5>make a living,</v>

1993
01:31:15.210 --> 01:31:19.890
<v Speaker 5>to just invent stories and weird things </v>
<v Speaker 5>that happen and just put it all together</v>

1994
01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:21.810
<v Speaker 5>in your head and then give it to people </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

1995
01:31:21.811 --> 01:31:22.740
<v Speaker 5>look what I've done.</v>

1996
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:24.630
<v Speaker 5>I came up with a story and then you </v>
<v Speaker 5>open,</v>

1997
01:31:24.631 --> 01:31:25.500
<v Speaker 5>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck.</v>

1998
01:31:25.501 --> 01:31:27.540
<v Speaker 5>Where's the story going?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This story crazy.</v>

1999
01:31:27.810 --> 01:31:32.810
<v Speaker 5>It's a really interesting way to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make a living because he's using like</v>

2000
01:31:33.031 --> 01:31:33.864
<v Speaker 5>he's flexing one very specific part of </v>
<v Speaker 5>his brain that most people don't really </v>

2001
01:31:37.891 --> 01:31:38.724
<v Speaker 5>use at all or hardly ever used.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most of us don't have any type of </v>

2002
01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:45.890
<v Speaker 5>creativity left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's sucked out through school work.</v>

2003
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.823
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're fucking taught to just go sit and </v>

2004
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:52.320
<v Speaker 5>be a cog in the machine unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>super fortunate and have a job where you</v>

2005
01:31:52.321 --> 01:31:53.280
<v Speaker 5>can create.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2006
01:31:53.340 --> 01:31:54.173
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

2007
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.840
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.110
<v Speaker 5>Got a tickle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That piece though.</v>

2009
01:31:58.380 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 5>I met this Guy Decker,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who is one</v>

2010
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:00.813
<v Speaker 2>of fucking opera's greatest mentors out </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Sedona and he's a fictional writer </v>

2011
01:32:04.721 --> 01:32:07.240
<v Speaker 2>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just fucking,</v>

2012
01:32:07.270 --> 01:32:10.840
<v Speaker 2>he's a wizard and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a water fast,</v>

2013
01:32:11.230 --> 01:32:13.840
<v Speaker 2>so I had a wife five day water fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ellen just water,</v>

2014
01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:16.270
<v Speaker 2>just water for five days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long did you make it?</v>

2015
01:32:16.450 --> 01:32:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Four and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn,</v>

2016
01:32:17.850 --> 01:32:19.990
<v Speaker 2>he's throwing up a half a day early.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2017
01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.460
<v Speaker 2>the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so close to home,</v>

2018
01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:24.830
<v Speaker 2>the thing was a science shows four days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2019
01:32:24.831 --> 01:32:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Four days is the magic mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the extra day was just like,</v>

2020
01:32:27.851 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got an extra day to go.</v>

2021
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:30.423
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2022
01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:34.570
<v Speaker 2>we hiked cathedral rock in Sedona and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking epic.</v>

2023
01:32:34.660 --> 01:32:36.760
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an energy there like New York,</v>

2024
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:38.080
<v Speaker 2>but different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what is,</v>

01:32:39.431 --> 01:32:41.310
<v Speaker 2>Why is it don't all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this a donor?</v>

2027
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2028
01:32:42.221 --> 01:32:43.054
<v Speaker 2>from what I understand why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it's the hippies traveler's guide </v>

<v Speaker 2>are you familiar with pulsed </v>
<v Speaker 2>electromagnetic frequency?</v>

2031
01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:53.313
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard that those words for </v>

2032
01:32:54.491 --> 01:32:55.324
<v Speaker 2>everybody of everyone that's about to </v>
<v Speaker 2>jump on the fucking Wu bandwagon and </v>

2033
01:32:59.171 --> 01:33:01.690
<v Speaker 2>shit on me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Punching the Google bar.</v>

2034
01:33:01.691 --> 01:33:05.530
<v Speaker 2>Do me a solid punching the Google bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NASA study on Pemf.</v>

2035
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:06.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three this year fucking study verified </v>

2036
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:11.620
<v Speaker 2>with the earth has its own energy field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2037
01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Whether you want to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think the earth is alive and</v>

2038
01:33:14.141 --> 01:33:15.670
<v Speaker 2>it's guy and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll leave that up to you,</v>

2039
01:33:15.671 --> 01:33:18.840
<v Speaker 2>but it has its own fucking energy field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's,</v>

2040
01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:21.340
<v Speaker 2>it's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not equal throughout the earth.</v>

2041
01:33:21.341 --> 01:33:24.250
<v Speaker 2>There are places where that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>accentuated and you feel that more.</v>

2042
01:33:24.630 --> 01:33:25.990
<v Speaker 2>You feel it more when you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ocean.</v>

2043
01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:26.853
<v Speaker 2>There's negative ions there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>looks so weird to me.</v>

2054

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasionally a word just looks weird.</v>

2055
01:33:50.770 --> 01:33:52.030
<v Speaker 2>That looks weird,</v>

2170
01:38:41.791 --> 01:38:43.800
<v Speaker 4>the substance has helped me draw me into</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2171
01:38:43.801 --> 01:38:46.260
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a special guy.</v>

2172
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.000
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

2173
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:48.690
<v Speaker 4>there's quite a few special people out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

2174
01:38:48.691 --> 01:38:51.300
<v Speaker 4>which is why we're so lucky we can go to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movies.</v>

2175
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:53.790
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2176
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.220
<v Speaker 4>think of how much fucking creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much thought and imagining scenarios</v>

2177
01:38:59.221 --> 01:39:00.930
<v Speaker 4>and putting them all together that takes</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make,</v>

2178
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:05.160
<v Speaker 4>like I saw the incredibles two yesterday</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it don't fucking incredible.</v>

2179
01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.160
<v Speaker 4>The first one we're going to mean to say</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible because it's an incredible,</v>

2180
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:11.460
<v Speaker 4>it's great we're considering taking bear</v>
<v Speaker 4>to that,</v>

2181
01:39:11.461 --> 01:39:13.530
<v Speaker 4>but he's only three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so we're not sure if you're a PR.</v>

2182
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:15.840
<v Speaker 4>He loves those movies at home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>

2183
01:39:15.841 --> 01:39:18.930
<v Speaker 4>he talks and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little kids talk at the movie theater.</v>

2184
01:39:18.931 --> 01:39:20.520
<v Speaker 4>When you go to a little kid movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's normal.</v>

2185
01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:22.050
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's other little kids doing it too,</v>

2186
01:39:22.051 --> 01:39:24.110
<v Speaker 4>and we think we might do that for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibles two.</v>

2187
01:39:24.340 --> 01:39:25.620
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking so good.</v>

2188
01:39:25.621 --> 01:39:28.050
<v Speaker 4>The Pixar movies are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see the good dinosaur?</v>

2189
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:30.570
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that tells me I got gotta be honest.</v>

2190
01:39:30.571 --> 01:39:31.404
<v Speaker 4>That doesn't know why people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go when a bunch of teenagers are </v>

2191
01:39:33.061 --> 01:39:36.540
<v Speaker 4>there or like young adults and the baby </v>
<v Speaker 4>starts talking,</v>

2192
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:40.300
<v Speaker 4>they should be like a day like this </v>
<v Speaker 4>should be certain shit.</v>

2193
01:39:40.410 --> 01:39:44.370
<v Speaker 4>They do show the day and the kids are </v>
<v Speaker 4>allowed to talk for show of the day in a</v>

2194
01:39:44.371 --> 01:39:45.610
<v Speaker 4>lot of theaters do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2195
01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.240
<v Speaker 4>see that's smart for the matinee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's smart.</v>

2196
01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:50.220
<v Speaker 4>That's smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Damn,</v>

2197
01:39:50.221 --> 01:39:51.360
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that opens up the door.</v>

2198
01:39:51.361 --> 01:39:52.590
<v Speaker 4>If you tell them they're allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk.</v>

2199
01:39:53.010 --> 01:39:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's true.</v>

2200
01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:54.773
<v Speaker 4>It's still try to keep it quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but do a good dinosaur pixar movie and </v>

2201
01:39:58.381 --> 01:40:01.080
<v Speaker 4>they fucking trip balls in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2202
01:40:01.081 --> 01:40:03.640
<v Speaker 4>What did I eat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like some rotten fruit and,</v>

2203
01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:06.540
<v Speaker 4>and the fucking green dinosaur grows </v>
<v Speaker 4>like four eyes.</v>

2204
01:40:06.541 --> 01:40:08.850
<v Speaker 4>Then they switch heads and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>running through everywhere.</v>

2205
01:40:09.030 --> 01:40:09.863
<v Speaker 4>I forgot what each other's schools.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He sticks his tongue out and he's got </v>

2206
01:40:12.451 --> 01:40:15.480
<v Speaker 4>the kid's face for his tongue was </v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome.</v>

2207
01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:18.690
<v Speaker 4>I forgot all about the trickling it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This society is changing,</v>

2208
01:40:19.110 --> 01:40:20.670
<v Speaker 4>you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2209
01:40:20.730 --> 01:40:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah,</v>

2210
01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:24.060
<v Speaker 4>it's the renaissance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Pollan said that,</v>

2211
01:40:24.061 --> 01:40:26.970
<v Speaker 4>and he's not even an advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows it's challenging.</v>

2212
01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:30.600
<v Speaker 4>He's kind of more of an advocate now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly than he was before.</v>

2213
01:40:30.601 --> 01:40:33.300
<v Speaker 4>He wrote that book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his most recent book on psychedelics.</v>

2214
01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:34.673
<v Speaker 4>It that changed his life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a smart play if you're a </v>

2215
01:40:38.311 --> 01:40:40.080
<v Speaker 4>person in his position to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2216
01:40:40.081 --> 01:40:42.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm just an advocate for the science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2217
01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:44.970
<v Speaker 4>But as Rick Doblin says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2218
01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:45.893
<v Speaker 4>if the stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when this stuff becomes available to </v>

2219
01:40:47.701 --> 01:40:48.960
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's never going to be,</v>

2220
01:40:48.961 --> 01:40:49.794
<v Speaker 4>you go fill your fucking prescription of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Siliciden at walgreens and you can go </v>

2221
01:40:52.471 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 4>fuck off anywhere you want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2222
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:57.910
<v Speaker 2>They'll have facility centers where </v>
<v Speaker 2>people can go and it'll be guided.</v>

2223
01:40:57.911 --> 01:41:01.150
<v Speaker 2>The right circumstances set and setting </v>
<v Speaker 2>will be paid attention to.</v>

2224
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:02.583
<v Speaker 2>But in that experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it shouldn't just be for sick </v>

2225
01:41:06.221 --> 01:41:07.054
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't just be for people with </v>

2226
01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:10.570
<v Speaker 2>depression or ptsd or some type of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2227
01:41:10.670 --> 01:41:12.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rape victims w fill in the blank.</v>

2228
01:41:12.701 --> 01:41:13.534
<v Speaker 2>It should be healthy individuals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>also want to have a deeper connection </v>

2229
01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:19.720
<v Speaker 2>and to figure shit out and have new </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective in life.</v>

2230
01:41:19.780 --> 01:41:20.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Paul and I would,</v>

2231
01:41:20.890 --> 01:41:24.220
<v Speaker 2>I would qualify as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's a healthy guy.</v>

2232
01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:25.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heart,</v>

2233
01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:26.794
<v Speaker 2>heart shit aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's a healthy guy who wanted to </v>

2234
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:29.703
<v Speaker 2>have an experience that would draw him </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a little deeper so he can understand </v>

2235
01:41:32.201 --> 01:41:33.034
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when you listen to him talk about </v>

2236
01:41:33.551 --> 01:41:34.384
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no doubt he's fucking sold on </v>

2237
01:41:35.231 --> 01:41:36.340
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2238
01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:37.293
<v Speaker 5>I think what you're saying is really </v>
<v Speaker 5>important because I don't think there </v>

2239
01:41:38.561 --> 01:41:41.020
<v Speaker 5>should be any restrictions on something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's super beneficial.</v>

2240
01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:44.470
<v Speaker 5>If there's no real indications that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>hurting these people.</v>

2241
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:47.020
<v Speaker 5>And it's all these indications that it's</v>
<v Speaker 5>helping these people,</v>

2242
01:41:47.380 --> 01:41:49.150
<v Speaker 5>especially when it comes to trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

2243
01:41:49.151 --> 01:41:49.984
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's certain people that for sure </v>

2244
01:41:52.521 --> 01:41:55.190
<v Speaker 5>have experienced way more trauma than </v>
<v Speaker 5>others.</v>

2245
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:56.990
<v Speaker 5>There's certain people that have,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2246
01:41:56.991 --> 01:41:59.630
<v Speaker 5>been to war,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've lost friends,</v>

2247
01:41:59.660 --> 01:42:01.460
<v Speaker 5>they've been involved in car accidents.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's,</v>

2248
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:02.303
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's certain people that have been </v>

2249
01:42:02.901 --> 01:42:03.734
<v Speaker 5>through things that are just horrific </v>
<v Speaker 5>and almost impossible to forget and the </v>

2250
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:08.833
<v Speaker 5>dad is a fact that they should have </v>
<v Speaker 5>access to this medicine but did it just </v>

2251
01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:13.124
<v Speaker 5>because like some girl lived her life </v>
<v Speaker 5>and didn't have anything traumatic </v>

2252
01:42:17.481 --> 01:42:18.314
<v Speaker 5>happen to her and she's trying to find </v>
<v Speaker 5>her way in this world and she's trying </v>

2253
01:42:20.511 --> 01:42:21.650
<v Speaker 5>to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2254
01:42:21.651 --> 01:42:22.484
<v Speaker 5>what his insecurity or what is my </v>
<v Speaker 5>connection to these people when we'll </v>

2255
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:27.850
<v Speaker 5>whatever my real passions and drives in </v>
<v Speaker 5>life.</v>

2256
01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:28.723
<v Speaker 5>She says I'm going to take a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some sort of a mdm may molly trip and </v>

2257
01:42:33.951 --> 01:42:36.380
<v Speaker 5>find out how I feel about things is find</v>
<v Speaker 5>out of it.</v>

2258
01:42:36.381 --> 01:42:38.610
<v Speaker 5>It gives me anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She should be able to do it too.</v>

2259
01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:39.793
<v Speaker 5>She be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she should be able to experiment with </v>

2260
01:42:40.941 --> 01:42:43.190
<v Speaker 5>their brain and see like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2261
01:42:43.191 --> 01:42:45.770
<v Speaker 5>all these people are reporting super </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive experiences.</v>

2262
01:42:45.771 --> 01:42:46.604
<v Speaker 5>What am I supposed to ignore it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because some bureaucrat has decided for </v>

2263
01:42:49.731 --> 01:42:50.564
<v Speaker 5>whatever connection they have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some pharmaceutical companies that you </v>

2264
01:42:53.091 --> 01:42:56.810
<v Speaker 5>fucking keep this gate tight on making </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything illegal.</v>

2265
01:42:56.811 --> 01:42:57.644
<v Speaker 5>Anything you make,</v>
<v Speaker 5>legal is going to fuck with my bottom </v>

2266
01:42:59.601 --> 01:43:01.550
<v Speaker 5>line.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's what a lot of people think.</v>

2267
01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:02.713
<v Speaker 5>And so there's this weird sort of </v>
<v Speaker 5>disconnect between the people that want </v>

2268
01:43:06.291 --> 01:43:09.050
<v Speaker 5>the drugs and the people that won't let </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have the drugs.</v>

2269
01:43:09.051 --> 01:43:12.080
<v Speaker 5>Like who are you working for that people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that won't let us have the drugs.</v>

2270
01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:15.770
<v Speaker 5>And why do these other people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>want the drugs think the drugs are bad?</v>

2271
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:18.260
<v Speaker 5>Do they have any pot experience </v>
<v Speaker 5>themselves?</v>

2272
01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:20.390
<v Speaker 5>No.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well then you can't vote about pot.</v>

2273
01:43:20.391 --> 01:43:21.950
<v Speaker 5>You'd fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2274
01:43:21.951 --> 01:43:23.810
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2275
01:43:23.811 --> 01:43:25.700
<v Speaker 5>You shouldn't be a doctor unless you go </v>
<v Speaker 5>to med school.</v>

2276
01:43:25.970 --> 01:43:28.640
<v Speaker 5>He shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he shouldn't talk about driving a car.</v>

2277
01:43:28.641 --> 01:43:33.641
<v Speaker 5>If you've never driven a fucking car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know you can't talk about pod.</v>

2278
01:43:34.221 --> 01:43:35.054
<v Speaker 5>If you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know what you're talking </v>

2279
01:43:36.201 --> 01:43:36.611
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So,</v>

2280
01:43:36.611 --> 01:43:37.460
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you smoke pot,</v>

2281
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:39.470

<v Speaker 5>Fuck off</v>

2283
01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:42.110
<v Speaker 2>pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2284
01:43:42.110 --> 01:43:43.520
<v Speaker 2>that's Graham Hancock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't,</v>

2285
01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:45.170
<v Speaker 2>you always talking about Richard </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dawkins.</v>

2286
01:43:45.230 --> 01:43:46.063
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a seat at the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>table to tell me what my Iowasca </v>

2287
01:43:49.071 --> 01:43:50.720
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you've done it,</v>

2288
01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:52.130
<v Speaker 2>you don't a seat at the table,</v>

2289
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:55.100
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to tell me at some neuro </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemical reaction,</v>

2290
01:43:55.101 --> 01:43:57.920
<v Speaker 4>and this is where it fits in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you haven't had that experience,</v>

2291
01:43:57.921 --> 01:43:59.960
<v Speaker 4>you can't tell me that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's,</v>

2292
01:43:59.961 --> 01:44:00.794
<v Speaker 4>that's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the one thing that's fucking odd </v>

2293
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:07.550
<v Speaker 4>at the very least when people go through</v>
<v Speaker 4>these experiences and Poland talks about</v>

2294
01:44:07.551 --> 01:44:10.100
<v Speaker 4>this too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is how real it feels.</v>

2295
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:13.730
<v Speaker 4>It's how important it is and how much </v>
<v Speaker 4>meaning they have.</v>

2296
01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.700
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's going to fucking tell me that.</v>

2297
01:44:16.701 --> 01:44:18.650
<v Speaker 4>My Oscar Iowaska experience didn't mean </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2298
01:44:18.651 --> 01:44:19.484
<v Speaker 4>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2299
01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:20.353
<v Speaker 4>in one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife and I shared the same vision of </v>

2300
01:44:22.041 --> 01:44:22.874
<v Speaker 4>holding a child and the next experience </v>
<v Speaker 4>we saw it was a boy and fucking all the </v>

2301
01:44:26.931 --> 01:44:31.640
<v Speaker 4>fear of being a parent came up and less </v>
<v Speaker 4>than a month later we were pregnant with</v>

2302
01:44:31.641 --> 01:44:34.850
<v Speaker 4>bear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's as real as it fucking gets.</v>

2303
01:44:34.851 --> 01:44:37.610
<v Speaker 4>And it manifested after that coincidence</v>
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>

2304
01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:40.400
<v Speaker 4>I have a real problem with the word real</v>
<v Speaker 4>to you know,</v>

2305
01:44:40.401 --> 01:44:40.821
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

2306
01:44:40.821 --> 01:44:42.670
<v Speaker 4>when people try to say that's not </v>
<v Speaker 4>really,</v>

2307
01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:44.600
<v Speaker 4>that's a hallucination.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter.</v>

2308
01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:48.110
<v Speaker 4>It's the same experience like e what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>By saying it's not real.</v>

2309
01:44:48.111 --> 01:44:48.944
<v Speaker 4>So what are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're saying that I can't grab it and </v>

2310
01:44:50.661 --> 01:44:54.350
<v Speaker 4>throw a fucking net over it and drag it </v>
<v Speaker 4>away and then show it to you again.</v>

2311
01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:56.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well then it's not real.</v>

2312
01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.580
<v Speaker 4>You can't be repeated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A double blind study.</v>

2313
01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:00.470
<v Speaker 4>How would you say it's not real if it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening?</v>

2314
01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:02.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can't repeat that.</v>

2315
01:45:02.031 --> 01:45:04.550
<v Speaker 4>Eight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that a weird take ios good rest of my</v>

2316
01:45:04.551 --> 01:45:05.384
<v Speaker 4>life and I'm still not going to repeat </v>
<v Speaker 4>the same vision and the same fucking </v>

2317
01:45:07.491 --> 01:45:09.380
<v Speaker 4>experience again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2318
01:45:09.381 --> 01:45:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Anytime you think these different dmt </v>

<v Speaker 4>your next trip is going to be a mind </v>
<v Speaker 4>bender.</v>

2320

<v Speaker 4>You're in your next trip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get cocky going in there.</v>

2321
01:45:17.210 --> 01:45:18.021
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've done this before.</v>

2322
01:45:18.021 --> 01:45:19.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm just pretty relaxed about my dmt </v>
<v Speaker 4>trip.</v>

2323
01:45:19.911 --> 01:45:21.610
<v Speaker 4>So used to really freak you out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want anymore,</v>

2324
01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.420
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You better be scared.</v>

2325

<v Speaker 4>You're white knuckling it right now.</v>

2326
01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:28.550
<v Speaker 4>You're going to go deep and govern the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

2327
01:45:28.551 --> 01:45:29.384
<v Speaker 4>They said the same thing about Iowa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done hundreds of ceremonies and </v>

2328
01:45:31.361 --> 01:45:33.800
<v Speaker 4>he's still gets nervous every fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

2329
01:45:33.801 --> 01:45:34.634
<v Speaker 4>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get nervous before you do anything </v>

2330
01:45:35.361 --> 01:45:36.194
<v Speaker 4>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So sign the [inaudible] getting ready </v>

2331
01:45:38.091 --> 01:45:39.410
<v Speaker 4>for something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2332
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:40.244
<v Speaker 4>and there's a healthy level of respect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think most people would run into the </v>

2333
01:45:42.321 --> 01:45:43.190
<v Speaker 4>issue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2334
01:45:43.191 --> 01:45:44.024
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want,</v>

2335
01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:45.313
<v Speaker 4>they want to alter their consciousness </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'll take a substance thinking </v>

2336
01:45:48.111 --> 01:45:50.030
<v Speaker 4>like this is going to make me feel a </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain way.</v>

2337
01:45:50.420 --> 01:45:52.640
<v Speaker 4>And then all of a sudden they got to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with some shit.</v>

2338
01:45:52.641 --> 01:45:53.660
<v Speaker 4>They got to work through something.</v>

2339
01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:55.400
<v Speaker 4>And that's not what they had on their </v>
<v Speaker 4>radar.</v>

2340
01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:56.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2341
01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.620
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2342
01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.393
<v Speaker 4>And then also this need to control.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The experience is always the thing that </v>

2343
01:46:02.681 --> 01:46:05.150
<v Speaker 4>fucking sends everybody off the rails </v>
<v Speaker 4>and into the woods.</v>

2344
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:07.310
<v Speaker 4>If they're having any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience,</v>

2345
01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:09.200
<v Speaker 4>this need to control that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2346
01:46:09.201 --> 01:46:10.250
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And you've got to surrender to it.</v>

2352
01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:19.850
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to go through 15 minutes of</v>

<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

2395
01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:45.773
<v Speaker 2>And if you have the opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially getting fucking DMT or </v>

2396
01:47:48.330 --> 01:47:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is dmt base,</v>

2397
01:47:49.831 --> 01:47:51.210
<v Speaker 2>like to have that ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2398
01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.740
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is yes.</v>

2399
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.170
<v Speaker 2>You</v>

2400
01:47:53.170 --> 01:47:57.040
<v Speaker 5>wonder what the guys who created yoga </v>
<v Speaker 5>we're doing.</v>

2401
01:47:58.030 --> 01:47:59.500
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think those people,</v>

2402
01:47:59.510 --> 01:48:00.343
<v Speaker 5>like those people that learn how to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>those long holding poses and that they </v>

2403
01:48:04.571 --> 01:48:05.710
<v Speaker 5>were practicing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2404
01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:08.920
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of belief that those </v>
<v Speaker 5>people were eating a lot of Hash.</v>

2405
01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:11.820
<v Speaker 5>Like especially the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the earliest people that were,</v>

2406
01:48:11.890 --> 01:48:15.060
<v Speaker 5>that created it and they were so ma,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck soma was,</v>

2407
01:48:15.061 --> 01:48:17.460
<v Speaker 5>you ever hear references to Soma?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like,</v>

2408
01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't even think they know what that </v>
<v Speaker 5>is.</v>

2409
01:48:18.761 --> 01:48:23.620
<v Speaker 5>Some sort of a psychedelic,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that whole practice of yoga,</v>

2410
01:48:23.740 --> 01:48:25.990
<v Speaker 5>if you really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of what yoga is like,</v>

2411
01:48:25.991 --> 01:48:30.220
<v Speaker 5>you have to just breathe and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>concentrate on maintaining the pose.</v>

2412
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:32.980
<v Speaker 5>You have to put yourself into this like </v>
<v Speaker 5>surrender zone.</v>

2413
01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:35.290
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't like fight a position.</v>

2414
01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:36.303
<v Speaker 5>He just Kinda Kinda accepted and just </v>
<v Speaker 5>concentrate on breathing and hold it as </v>

2415
01:48:39.041 --> 01:48:41.740
<v Speaker 5>long as you can until your body starts </v>
<v Speaker 5>giving out.</v>

2416
01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:42.633
<v Speaker 5>And then you let it go again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I think that prepares you in some </v>

2417
01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:47.590
<v Speaker 5>way to let go in psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences.</v>

2418
01:48:47.591 --> 01:48:50.780
<v Speaker 5>I think that people that don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2419
01:48:50.890 --> 01:48:55.120
<v Speaker 5>if you don't have any kind of physical </v>
<v Speaker 5>altercation with your body,</v>

2420
01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:56.740
<v Speaker 5>there's no like moment where you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2421
01:48:56.741 --> 01:48:57.650
<v Speaker 5>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>come on Bri,</v>

2422
01:48:57.680 --> 01:48:58.220
<v Speaker 5>Bri,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bri,</v>

2423
01:48:58.220 --> 01:48:58.691
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

2424
01:48:58.691 --> 01:49:00.070
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have any of those,</v>

2425
01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:01.031
<v Speaker 5>if he never,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2426
01:49:01.031 --> 01:49:04.290
<v Speaker 5>I don't give a fuck what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's a spin class or just,</v>

2427
01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:05.253
<v Speaker 5>if you never have anything where you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>pushing yourself when you don't want to </v>

2428
01:49:07.631 --> 01:49:09.100
<v Speaker 5>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you make yourself do it and then you</v>

2429
01:49:09.101 --> 01:49:10.660
<v Speaker 5>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have those,</v>

2430
01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:11.673
<v Speaker 5>like those little moments where you </v>
<v Speaker 5>overcame something that feels </v>

2431
01:49:14.441 --> 01:49:16.570
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then those,</v>

2432
01:49:16.630 --> 01:49:17.463
<v Speaker 5>those bends in the trip road or scary </v>
<v Speaker 5>dark because you don't have any success </v>

2433
01:49:21.761 --> 01:49:22.594
<v Speaker 5>in coming back from bad states.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't have any success from and </v>

2434
01:49:25.810 --> 01:49:26.643
<v Speaker 5>coming back from like feeling really </v>
<v Speaker 5>scared or feeling really nervous like </v>

2435
01:49:30.311 --> 01:49:33.850
<v Speaker 5>those build up a database if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>have a lot of success in doing those are</v>

2436
01:49:33.851 --> 01:49:38.020
<v Speaker 5>especially a success and getting your </v>
<v Speaker 5>body to just fucking relax,</v>

2437
01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:39.910
<v Speaker 5>just fucking relax.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just a broken leg.</v>

2438
01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:45.030
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have that in you like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably real hard to navigate some</v>

2439
01:49:45.611 --> 01:49:48.100
<v Speaker 5>of the darker roads of a where you just</v>

2440
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:48.933
<v Speaker 4>have to just have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just kind of just breathe and just try </v>

2441
01:49:51.321 --> 01:49:55.000
<v Speaker 4>to stay as calm as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let an embrace you as calm as you can.</v>

2442
01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:56.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that it,</v>

2443
01:49:56.061 --> 01:49:58.570
<v Speaker 4>it works both ways too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know like you have,</v>

2444
01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 4>if you put yourself in uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stressful spots in everyday life,</v>

2445
01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:08.170
<v Speaker 4>like a cold bath or the Cryo and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>come and you can stay calm in the,</v>

2446
01:50:08.230 --> 01:50:10.240
<v Speaker 4>in the fucking eye of the storm and come</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of that.</v>

2447
01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:11.613
<v Speaker 4>That extrapolates out in life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody cuts you off in traffic you're </v>

2448
01:50:14.561 --> 01:50:15.394
<v Speaker 4>a little bit more chill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that big of a deal and same </v>

2449
01:50:17.171 --> 01:50:19.300
<v Speaker 4>thing in the psychedelic experience that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go through some rough shit.</v>

2450
01:50:19.301 --> 01:50:20.500
<v Speaker 4>You come out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2451
01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:21.940
<v Speaker 4>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still have my body.</v>

2452
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:23.223
<v Speaker 4>I was able to work through that now it </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of lowers the noise on all the </v>

2453
01:50:26.081 --> 01:50:27.040
<v Speaker 4>bullshit in life.</v>

2454
01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:28.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

2455
01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:29.373
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something to what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just said about doing cryo to the Cryo </v>

2456
01:50:33.011 --> 01:50:36.820
<v Speaker 4>does make you chill out after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean for lack of a better term,</v>

2457
01:50:36.821 --> 01:50:38.940
<v Speaker 4>no pun intended,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your,</v>

2458
01:50:38.941 --> 01:50:39.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>

2459
01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2460
01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:42.640
<v Speaker 4>everything is so elevated after you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of there,</v>

2461
01:50:42.641 --> 01:50:44.440
<v Speaker 4>you feel so good that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2462
01:50:44.441 --> 01:50:45.274
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a feeling that like if there was </v>

2463
01:50:47.801 --> 01:50:48.634
<v Speaker 4>a way to do that in a spray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could buy that feelgood sprayed </v>

2464
01:50:51.130 --> 01:50:51.963
<v Speaker 4>seven 11 and give yourself a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pumps the same way you feel right after </v>

2465
01:50:54.161 --> 01:50:55.300
<v Speaker 4>Cryo,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would hit.</v>

2466
01:50:55.301 --> 01:50:56.980
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2467
01:50:57.220 --> 01:50:58.840
<v Speaker 4>you just get this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

2468
01:50:59.030 --> 01:51:00.850
<v Speaker 4>come out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all of a sudden your body feels warm</v>

2469
01:51:00.851 --> 01:51:01.930
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel great.</v>

2470
01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:06.120
<v Speaker 4>It's a nice little trick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a very nice little trick and it,</v>

2471
01:51:06.121 --> 01:51:06.954
<v Speaker 4>and it helps so many people in so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>different ways with the arthritis and </v>

2472
01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:14.380
<v Speaker 4>people have constant inflammation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>back problems,</v>

2473
01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:15.490
<v Speaker 4>knee problems.</v>

2474
01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:16.833
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's such a good way to just give </v>

2475
01:51:19.271 --> 01:51:22.540
<v Speaker 4>your body just a little extra reduction </v>
<v Speaker 4>in inflammation.</v>

2476
01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.880
<v Speaker 4>Just give yourself a little jolt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>

2477
01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.220
<v Speaker 4>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh.</v>

2478
01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:29.650
<v Speaker 4>It feels good man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People through it.</v>

2479
01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:32.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand the poo pooing of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're looking at it now.</v>

2480
01:51:32.291 --> 01:51:34.180
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're studying Wim Hoff at Stanford.</v>

2481
01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:38.080
<v Speaker 4>They see 550% increase in dopamine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2482
01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:38.973
<v Speaker 4>200 to 300% increase in a adrenaline,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which impacts the immune system </v>

2483
01:51:42.341 --> 01:51:45.190
<v Speaker 4>positively.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How long of a Wynn Hoff,</v>

2484
01:51:45.191 --> 01:51:47.710
<v Speaker 4>they have very different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have different levels of cold.</v>

2485
01:51:47.711 --> 01:51:50.590
<v Speaker 4>They're studying at one minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at 60 degrees,</v>

2486
01:51:50.591 --> 01:51:52.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or 10 minutes is 60 degrees,</v>

2487
01:51:52.781 --> 01:51:54.040
<v Speaker 4>one minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 degrees.</v>

2488
01:51:54.041 --> 01:51:55.360
<v Speaker 4>And then they're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're going to,</v>

2489
01:51:55.361 --> 01:51:56.194
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be more science that </v>
<v Speaker 4>comes out on different cause I want to </v>

2490
01:51:57.551 --> 01:52:00.340
<v Speaker 4>know like how long at 40 how long in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cryo,</v>

2491
01:52:00.341 --> 01:52:01.174
<v Speaker 4>how long does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we know there's some type of </v>

2492
01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.280
<v Speaker 4>neurochemical response from it.</v>

2493
01:52:06.490 --> 01:52:07.780
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And feel right.</v>

2494
01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's not just this,</v>

2495
01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:11.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not placebo.</v>

2496
01:52:11.621 --> 01:52:13.570
<v Speaker 4>It's not just your mind making this up </v>
<v Speaker 4>or man,</v>

2497
01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:15.160
<v Speaker 4>I feel really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think something's changed.</v>

2498
01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:15.450
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2499
01:52:15.450 --> 01:52:16.600
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are,</v>

2500
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:18.370
<v Speaker 4>you are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It does have an impact.</v>

2501
01:52:18.510 --> 01:52:19.343
<v Speaker 4>Well just and also stop and think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>all the people that were always scared </v>

2502
01:52:22.361 --> 01:52:23.194
<v Speaker 4>of the fucking vikings and the Russians </v>
<v Speaker 4>are scared of people coming out of the </v>

2503
01:52:27.131 --> 01:52:28.440
<v Speaker 4>snow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2504
01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:33.600
<v Speaker 4>and the white walkers probably was </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably something in our head.</v>

2505
01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:36.760
<v Speaker 4>It was someone who could survive the </v>
<v Speaker 4>snow that we can't like,</v>

2506
01:52:36.761 --> 01:52:38.590
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's going to be secure to be cold.</v>

2507
01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:41.260
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that that is who,</v>

<v Speaker 3>in Alaska.</v>

2515
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:58.190

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think I might've made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the number?</v>

2519
01:53:06.330 --> 01:53:09.050
<v Speaker 3>740,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the whole state.</v>

2523
01:53:17.331 --> 01:53:18.590
<v Speaker 3>living in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Alaska.</v>

2524
01:53:18.650 --> 01:53:20.120
<v Speaker 3>But there are hardy people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You look at him,</v>

2525
01:53:20.121 --> 01:53:20.720
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cam,</v>

2526
01:53:20.720 --> 01:53:23.570
<v Speaker 3>what would I do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three to 400,000.</v>

2527
01:53:23.571 --> 01:53:24.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2528
01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:25.700
<v Speaker 3>so it was probably right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2529
01:53:25.701 --> 01:53:27.770
<v Speaker 3>so that's like an anchorage is like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>real spot,</v>

2530
01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:28.753
<v Speaker 3>like a real city sorta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean real nice bars and restaurants </v>

2531
01:53:31.101 --> 01:53:31.934
<v Speaker 3>and chill like that.</v>

2532
01:53:32.210 --> 01:53:35.570
<v Speaker 3>But these shows about those people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>live up there,</v>

2533
01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:36.433
<v Speaker 3>those are all the people that live in </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the Arctic Circle area and they </v>

2534
01:53:39.110 --> 01:53:42.380
<v Speaker 3>chop their own fucking firewood and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight wolves off and shit.</v>

2535
01:53:42.381 --> 01:53:43.214
<v Speaker 3>Like this is one dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've talked about him several times in </v>

2536
01:53:45.591 --> 01:53:47.270
<v Speaker 3>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It lives by himself.</v>

2537
01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:48.133
<v Speaker 3>He's the one of the weirdest of all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's the weirdest of all the weird </v>

2538
01:53:50.871 --> 01:53:51.704
<v Speaker 3>people because all these other people </v>
<v Speaker 3>live in like regular houses and you </v>

2539
01:53:54.561 --> 01:53:55.394
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just live in a house that's </v>

2540
01:53:55.971 --> 01:53:56.804
<v Speaker 3>connected to this river and they take </v>
<v Speaker 3>their dogs dog sledding and they do a </v>

2541
01:53:59.740 --> 01:54:01.430
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they live in like a normal house.</v>

2542
01:54:01.431 --> 01:54:02.264
<v Speaker 3>They go into a house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This motherfucker has like this tiny </v>

2543
01:54:05.031 --> 01:54:05.864
<v Speaker 3>shack and he lives right next to a lake </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he lives by himself and he walks </v>

2544
01:54:09.681 --> 01:54:10.514
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and he somehow or another </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets like Peltz and shit and makes </v>

2545
01:54:14.151 --> 01:54:19.151
<v Speaker 3>enough money to buy bullets and he lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>out there by himself and he'll come into</v>

2546
01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.920
<v Speaker 3>town like once every couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently used to be married.</v>

2547
01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:24.320
<v Speaker 3>He's to have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating guy.</v>

2548
01:54:24.980 --> 01:54:25.813
<v Speaker 3>I mean this guy's not faking and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually really living up there by </v>

2549
01:54:28.101 --> 01:54:28.934
<v Speaker 3>himself in this room that's way smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the studio and he lives by himself </v>

2550
01:54:32.931 --> 01:54:33.764
<v Speaker 3>next to a lake and he had a shoot wolves</v>
<v Speaker 3>one night because they were coming for </v>

2551
01:54:36.561 --> 01:54:41.561
<v Speaker 3>his fucking Mousse or as Caribou.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing's crazy like by himself.</v>

2552
01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Nobody talked to I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that might be a draw for people,</v>

2553
01:54:46.191 --> 01:54:47.024
<v Speaker 3>especially if there is some merging of </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness and integration with with </v>

2554
01:54:50.351 --> 01:54:55.351
<v Speaker 3>the technology down the road like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of fuck this,</v>

2555
01:54:55.461 --> 01:54:56.294
<v Speaker 3>I'm going off the beaten path and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>already see that people want to be off </v>

2556
01:54:58.221 --> 01:54:59.054
<v Speaker 3>the grid but to truly be like balls deep</v>
<v Speaker 3>in nature where you have to deal with </v>

2557
01:55:02.600 --> 01:55:05.240
<v Speaker 3>wolves and bears and all the shit that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on like that.</v>

2558
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:07.160
<v Speaker 3>That might be a bigger draw down the </v>
<v Speaker 3>road.</v>

2559
01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:09.050
<v Speaker 3>Right now I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in that shit.</v>

2560
01:55:09.170 --> 01:55:10.550
<v Speaker 3>Well I'm not interested in that shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>either,</v>

2561
01:55:10.551 --> 01:55:11.384
<v Speaker 3>but I'm interested in him being </v>
<v Speaker 3>interested in it because I think that </v>

2562
01:55:14.541 --> 01:55:16.340
<v Speaker 3>what you were just saying about </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

2563
01:55:16.341 --> 01:55:18.170
<v Speaker 3>but I thought you were going to say is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about nature.</v>

2564
01:55:18.350 --> 01:55:19.183
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a deeper connection to </v>
<v Speaker 3>nature if you just live in it all the </v>

2565
01:55:23.421 --> 01:55:28.130
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that you get weird senses of like</v>

2566
01:55:28.131 --> 01:55:30.040
<v Speaker 3>where things are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

2567
01:55:30.041 --> 01:55:30.874
<v Speaker 3>how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the wind feels when it's coming at </v>

2568
01:55:32.451 --> 01:55:32.691
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2569
01:55:32.691 --> 01:55:35.090
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely coming this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>

2570
01:55:35.091 --> 01:55:37.670
<v Speaker 3>you know where to stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not to like,</v>

2571
01:55:37.671 --> 01:55:40.400
<v Speaker 3>you get a sense of the whole thing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a part of it.</v>

2572
01:55:40.401 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 3>You're not talking to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the only the dialogue you</v>

2573
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:45.810
<v Speaker 4>have is internal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a,</v>

2574
01:55:45.811 --> 01:55:48.600
<v Speaker 4>your buddy who fast swanee hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2575
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:50.760
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get that extra sensory coming in.</v>

2576
01:55:51.250 --> 01:55:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2577
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:54.530
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remy warrant always talked about that,</v>

2578
01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:59.040
<v Speaker 4>that you should hunt hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's primal shit dude.</v>

2579
01:56:00.380 --> 01:56:01.640
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

2580
01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.170
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally makes sense.</v>

2581
01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.190
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found out,</v>

2582
01:56:04.191 --> 01:56:05.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing the fasting,</v>

2583
01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:08.150
<v Speaker 4>I've done two five day fast now the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain,</v>

2584
01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:09.620
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not like,</v>

2585
01:56:09.650 --> 01:56:11.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean I have extra energy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sleep kind of goes to shit,</v>

2586
01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:12.973
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Michael Walker talked a bit about </v>

2587
01:56:13.641 --> 01:56:15.410
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

2588
01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:19.000
<v Speaker 4>I can't sit and read.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can't just focus in like,</v>

2589
01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:19.853
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2590
01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:20.713
<v Speaker 4>my brain's turned on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me just bang out emails or fucking </v>

2591
01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.800
<v Speaker 4>read a book.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't work that way,</v>

2592
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:25.663
<v Speaker 4>but I do start to problem solve in a way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not possible and not common when </v>

2593
01:56:31.281 --> 01:56:33.770
<v Speaker 4>I'm eating food all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just works differently.</v>

2594
01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:35.600
<v Speaker 4>Like all this other shit turns on.</v>

2595
01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:37.673
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2596
01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:43.460
<v Speaker 4>Now when you were talking earlier about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this creative experience [inaudible] how</v>

2597
01:56:43.461 --> 01:56:47.180
<v Speaker 4>many times have you done Kratom well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a boatload of it.</v>

2598
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:48.220
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2599
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:52.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2600
01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:53.650
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I,</v>

2601
01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:55.580
<v Speaker 4>I've lost track of how many times I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>done it,</v>

2602
01:56:55.581 --> 01:56:58.400
<v Speaker 4>but usually when I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is that that one to two pill dose.</v>

2603
01:56:58.430 --> 01:57:00.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't exceed that often.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're a guy who,</v>

2604
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:01.843
<v Speaker 4>the reason why I ask is you're a guy who</v>
<v Speaker 4>is always on top of all the latest and </v>

2605
01:57:05.571 --> 01:57:07.850
<v Speaker 4>greatest in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 4>supplementation,</v>

2606
01:57:07.851 --> 01:57:08.684
<v Speaker 4>the benefits of certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you know when to stick them in </v>

2607
01:57:11.570 --> 01:57:14.180
<v Speaker 4>and like when to lay off other stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause how do you know,</v>

2608
01:57:14.210 --> 01:57:15.043
<v Speaker 4>because you're not necessarily getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>your blood tests all the time after you </v>

2609
01:57:17.091 --> 01:57:18.260
<v Speaker 4>do some of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2610
01:57:18.290 --> 01:57:19.370
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do blood work,</v>

2611
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:20.300
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fairly often.</v>

2612
01:57:20.301 --> 01:57:23.000
<v Speaker 4>But that's just more for general health </v>
<v Speaker 4>and wellness.</v>

2613
01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:24.800
<v Speaker 4>It's not to see how things are impacting</v>
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>

2614
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:25.910
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do,</v>

2615
01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:27.353
<v Speaker 4>do you like have a detailed analysis of </v>
<v Speaker 4>like what you were taking and the days </v>

2616
01:57:30.921 --> 01:57:34.010
<v Speaker 4>before blood work and then compare it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>times?</v>

2617
01:57:34.011 --> 01:57:35.840
<v Speaker 4>We're not taking those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most of the thing,</v>

2618
01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:36.733
<v Speaker 4>the thing that has the biggest impact on</v>
<v Speaker 4>my blood work as if I'm in Ketosis or </v>

2619
01:57:38.901 --> 01:57:39.734
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2620
01:57:39.770 --> 01:57:41.480
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no fucking doubt.</v>

2621
01:57:41.481 --> 01:57:42.860
<v Speaker 4>And that's also genetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2622
01:57:42.861 --> 01:57:45.110
<v Speaker 4>it's not the fucking right diet for </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone.</v>

2623
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:48.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a pain the ass to here.</v>

2624
01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:49.161
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2625
01:57:49.161 --> 01:57:51.560
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck the right one for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2626
01:57:53.190 --> 01:57:54.380
<v Speaker 4>You got to figure that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2627
01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:56.000
<v Speaker 4>and wired to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a game changer.</v>

2628
01:57:56.210 --> 01:57:58.370
<v Speaker 4>It really is very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you gotta,</v>

2629
01:57:58.371 --> 01:58:00.590
<v Speaker 4>you gotta do your fucking homework.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2630
01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:03.740
<v Speaker 4>Rob Actually puts it into action on his </v>
<v Speaker 4>instagram page.</v>

2631
01:58:03.741 --> 01:58:06.140
<v Speaker 4>Robb wolf and his wife will eat the </v>
<v Speaker 4>exact same thing.</v>

2632
01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:10.010
<v Speaker 4>And then he tests ketone levels and </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood sugar and blood sugar levels,</v>

2633
01:58:10.040 --> 01:58:10.873
<v Speaker 4>like at the same timestamp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And his and hers are radically </v>

2634
01:58:14.541 --> 01:58:16.640
<v Speaker 4>different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like she's just better at serving stuff.</v>

2635
01:58:16.670 --> 01:58:17.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2636
01:58:17.541 --> 01:58:20.000
<v Speaker 4>And so I'm similar to him genetically in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2637
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:21.223
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't do well with a lot of </v>

2638
01:58:22.371 --> 01:58:23.204
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates and like a wide variety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can eat a plate of yams and my blood </v>

2639
01:58:26.541 --> 01:58:27.374
<v Speaker 4>sugar looks fine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if I have a little bit of white </v>

2640
01:58:28.341 --> 01:58:29.900
<v Speaker 4>rice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking through the roof.</v>

2641
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:30.763
<v Speaker 4>Like pre diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you listen to the podcast that I </v>

2642
01:58:33.411 --> 01:58:34.580
<v Speaker 4>did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was Zack bitter?</v>

2643
01:58:34.970 --> 01:58:37.430
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's the guy that holds the world record</v>

2644
01:58:37.431 --> 01:58:40.940
<v Speaker 4>for running a hundred miles in America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ran a hundred miles,</v>

2645
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:45.850
<v Speaker 4>literally ran a seven minute pace for 11</v>
<v Speaker 4>hours.</v>

2646
01:58:46.090 --> 01:58:48.580
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Damn.</v>

2647
01:58:48.940 --> 01:58:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the only thing that you could say</v>

2648
01:58:50.950 --> 01:58:51.783
<v Speaker 4>11 hours and 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was the total that is so </v>

2649
01:58:54.431 --> 01:58:55.380
<v Speaker 4>fucking crazy.</v>

2650
01:58:55.390 --> 01:59:00.160
<v Speaker 4>You can run seven minute miles for 11 </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours and 40 minutes.</v>

2651
01:59:00.161 --> 01:59:03.280
<v Speaker 4>Just keep going with ptosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or was he,</v>

2652
01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:05.440
<v Speaker 4>was he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time he's in Ketosis.</v>

2653
01:59:05.470 --> 01:59:07.660
<v Speaker 4>He eats a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2654
01:59:07.690 --> 01:59:11.410
<v Speaker 4>meet rich diet and he is a fat burner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2655
01:59:11.650 --> 01:59:15.340
<v Speaker 4>he's in Ketosis all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It takes all kinds of,</v>

2656
01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:16.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

2657
01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:19.570
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about his diet.</v>

2658
01:59:19.571 --> 01:59:21.970
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the things that he eats more</v>
<v Speaker 4>than anything was steak.</v>

2659
01:59:21.971 --> 01:59:23.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was like his big thing,</v>

2660
01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:26.710
<v Speaker 4>like fatty piece of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2661
01:59:26.711 --> 01:59:28.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he runs though,</v>

2662
01:59:28.570 --> 01:59:32.860
<v Speaker 4>when he's involved in a race or anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>where there's extremely,</v>

2663
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:36.880
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>extremely high requirements on his body,</v>

2664
01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.013
<v Speaker 4>then he goes way above like ketosis </v>
<v Speaker 4>levels of carbohydrates like androids </v>

2665
01:59:41.831 --> 01:59:44.290
<v Speaker 4>and hundreds of grams during the race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2666
01:59:44.380 --> 01:59:46.320
<v Speaker 4>that's totally what you should do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

2667
01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:49.990
<v Speaker 4>I'd ran that 50 k after I was on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>show last here it says,</v>

2668
01:59:50.230 --> 01:59:51.610
<v Speaker 4>he says what's even more surprising?</v>

2669
01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:56.610
<v Speaker 4>Those bitter trains and compete complete</v>
<v Speaker 4>competes on almost no carbs at times.</v>

2670
01:59:57.221 --> 02:00:02.221
<v Speaker 4>Carbs account for as little as 5% of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>diet and bitter insists that even we non</v>

2671
02:00:02.641 --> 02:00:04.720
<v Speaker 4>endurance record holders to do the same.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2672
02:00:04.721 --> 02:00:07.420
<v Speaker 4>But remember he was talking about when </v>
<v Speaker 4>he did the races,</v>

2673
02:00:07.421 --> 02:00:09.760
<v Speaker 4>he takes some glucose supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2674
02:00:09.761 --> 02:00:10.990
<v Speaker 4>Article about his whole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2675
02:00:10.991 --> 02:00:12.150
<v Speaker 4>I think it means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2676
02:00:12.250 --> 02:00:13.083
<v Speaker 4>most of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of the time when it's eating and </v>

2677
02:00:14.831 --> 02:00:19.120
<v Speaker 4>training and exercising,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's burning almost no carbs.</v>

2678
02:00:19.150 --> 02:00:20.560
<v Speaker 4>Well that's the goal though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2679
02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:23.320
<v Speaker 4>that's metabolic flexibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The goal is if we've,</v>

2680
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:24.183
<v Speaker 4>if we're from out the gate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we eat carbohydrates every fucking meal </v>

2681
02:00:27.730 --> 02:00:30.610
<v Speaker 4>until we're 40.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not making ketones.</v>

2682
02:00:30.611 --> 02:00:31.444
<v Speaker 4>Our body doesn't know how to use fat for</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuel if we at least spend a period of </v>

2683
02:00:33.551 --> 02:00:34.780
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's what I do now.</v>

2684
02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:39.250
<v Speaker 4>I'll spend about six months a year in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Ketosis with maybe a couple of carb days</v>

2685
02:00:39.390 --> 02:00:41.140
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a whole six month span.</v>

2686
02:00:41.530 --> 02:00:44.800
<v Speaker 4>And then after that I'll practice some </v>
<v Speaker 4>carb backloading or maybe I'll have,</v>

2687
02:00:44.801 --> 02:00:46.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher carbohydrate days,</v>

2688
02:00:46.181 --> 02:00:49.630
<v Speaker 4>but I'm still eating higher fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>higher protein throughout that and,</v>

2689
02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:52.780
<v Speaker 4>or moderate protein throughout that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that creates flexibility.</v>

2690
02:00:52.810 --> 02:00:54.220
<v Speaker 4>That's what we're designed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2691
02:00:54.221 --> 02:00:55.054
<v Speaker 4>you can argue all you want about what </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucken Paleo man eight and all that </v>

2692
02:00:57.431 --> 02:00:58.264
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the truth is before refrigeration </v>

2693
02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:05.320
<v Speaker 4>and before shipping,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did not have access to carbohydrates.</v>

2694
02:01:05.380 --> 02:01:06.213
<v Speaker 4>Most of the people on this planet didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have access for at least three months </v>

2695
02:01:08.171 --> 02:01:09.340
<v Speaker 4>out of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2696
02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I mean,</v>

2697
02:01:10.811 --> 02:01:11.644
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's at least a period of time where </v>

2698
02:01:12.491 --> 02:01:13.324
<v Speaker 4>we could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>should take off and allow our body to </v>

2699
02:01:14.981 --> 02:01:15.814
<v Speaker 4>reset and start to burn fat for fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when we go back to eating </v>

2700
02:01:19.061 --> 02:01:21.010
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we utilize it a little bit better.</v>

2701
02:01:21.100 --> 02:01:22.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's also people like the [inaudible]</v>

2702
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:26.050
<v Speaker 4>who didn't eat any vegetables at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2703
02:01:26.051 --> 02:01:26.884
<v Speaker 4>But I think even with them two months </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of the year when they'd grow </v>

2704
02:01:29.441 --> 02:01:30.274
<v Speaker 4>seasonally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'd eat a little bit more </v>

2705
02:01:31.091 --> 02:01:33.220
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates and probably not be fully </v>
<v Speaker 4>Kido.</v>

2706
02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:35.620
<v Speaker 4>What do you think the time of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what do you think they would eat?</v>

2707
02:01:35.710 --> 02:01:37.300
<v Speaker 4>Whatever the fuck grow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause they grow.</v>

2708
02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:39.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure two months out of the year they</v>
<v Speaker 4>can grow some shit,</v>

2709
02:01:40.460 --> 02:01:41.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

2710
02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:44.330
<v Speaker 2>Are there spots where they can never </v>
<v Speaker 2>grow anything all year round?</v>

2711
02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's going to hurt them.</v>

2712
02:01:47.031 --> 02:01:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with people that think you should be one</v>

2713
02:01:50.391 --> 02:01:53.270
<v Speaker 2>or the other year round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know like the same dumb ass argument.</v>

2714
02:01:53.271 --> 02:01:55.040
<v Speaker 2>You should only eat plants the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>

2715
02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:56.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it to be cute or the rest of your </v>

2716
02:01:57.321 --> 02:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're missing the point.</v>

2717
02:01:58.701 --> 02:01:59.534
<v Speaker 2>The point is to have your body finally </v>
<v Speaker 2>tuned and adaptable and able to to eat </v>

2718
02:02:03.261 --> 02:02:04.700
<v Speaker 2>all things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intermittent.</v>

2719
02:02:04.701 --> 02:02:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Fasting is good way to go about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2720
02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:07.873
<v Speaker 2>and when I do that regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I get like three or four days in a </v>

2721
02:02:11.661 --> 02:02:12.494
<v Speaker 2>row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a noticeable difference in like </v>

2722
02:02:13.580 --> 02:02:14.413
<v Speaker 2>the need to eat like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling that inflammation goes </v>

2723
02:02:17.541 --> 02:02:19.340
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive function goes up,</v>

2724
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:21.230
<v Speaker 2>sleep's improved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have this,</v>

2725
02:02:21.231 --> 02:02:22.550
<v Speaker 2>a lot of benefits to it for sure.</v>

2726
02:02:22.580 --> 02:02:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Some people are going crazy with it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing 20 and four and I'm like,</v>

2727
02:02:25.911 --> 02:02:26.750
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

2728
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:29.540
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not a terrible idea.</v>

2729
02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Not a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed this guy,</v>

2730
02:02:31.671 --> 02:02:34.100
<v Speaker 2>todd white,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the CEO of dry farm wines.</v>

2731
02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:38.240
<v Speaker 2>He does that every fucking day fast for </v>
<v Speaker 2>20 hours.</v>

2732
02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:40.850
<v Speaker 2>He'll have a bottle or two of the dry </v>
<v Speaker 2>farm with his dinner.</v>

2733
02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

2734
02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:44.210
<v Speaker 2>That's his fucking deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's shredded.</v>

2735
02:02:44.270 --> 02:02:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I met,</v>

02:02:45.141 --> 02:02:49.730
<v Speaker 2>met him at Paleo fx this year and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>curious to me because everybody that's a</v>

2737
02:02:49.731 --> 02:02:51.170
<v Speaker 2>part of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2738
02:02:51.171 --> 02:02:53.210
<v Speaker 2>their health oriented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of dialed in.</v>

2739
02:02:53.480 --> 02:02:54.920
<v Speaker 2>At least they're on track.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2740
02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:57.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work out that you can be a fat guy,</v>

2741
02:02:57.261 --> 02:02:58.730
<v Speaker 2>had a Paleo festival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pay,</v>

2742
02:02:59.210 --> 02:03:01.670
<v Speaker 2>they pay attention to what they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting in the body and how they move.</v>

2743
02:03:01.671 --> 02:03:02.504
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2744
02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:05.030
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at every kiosk or every,</v>

2745
02:03:05.031 --> 02:03:05.864
<v Speaker 2>every little booth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everyone looks the part at this </v>

2746
02:03:08.481 --> 02:03:09.314
<v Speaker 2>guy's booth.</v>

2747
02:03:09.380 --> 02:03:10.213
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's fucking shredded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's got a giant smile on their </v>

2748
02:03:12.441 --> 02:03:13.071
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2749
02:03:13.071 --> 02:03:14.540
<v Speaker 2>what's the fucking deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

2750
02:03:14.541 --> 02:03:16.370
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 out of 20 of us are Kido.</v>

2751
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of us do intermittent </v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting.</v>

2752
02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:21.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have group meditation every,</v>

2753
02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:23.480
<v Speaker 2>not that that would help with fat loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>

2754
02:03:23.481 --> 02:03:27.860
<v Speaker 2>just to say that they're dialed in group</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation every fucking day at 9:00</v>

2755
02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:29.870
<v Speaker 2>AM their entire company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the keys,</v>

2756
02:03:29.871 --> 02:03:33.770
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking legit guy to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meditation with the whole company,</v>

2757
02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:36.290
<v Speaker 2>with the entire company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many dudes just thinking about dicks</v>

2758
02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:40.430
<v Speaker 2>and angry it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to do group meditation.</v>

2759
02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:42.500
<v Speaker 2>They think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visualize this,</v>

2760
02:03:42.530 --> 02:03:46.560
<v Speaker 2>visualize those guys doing the Dick </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises nonstop with the weights to be</v>

2761
02:03:46.561 --> 02:03:47.331
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with my Dick look,</v>

2762
02:03:47.331 --> 02:03:49.310
<v Speaker 2>or it wasn't circumcised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would it look like?</v>

2763
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:53.920
<v Speaker 2>A picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd probably,</v>

2764
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:57.140
<v Speaker 2>it probably added half an inch or he </v>
<v Speaker 2>could just shoot stem cells into it,</v>

2765
02:03:57.141 --> 02:03:58.490
<v Speaker 2>like Greenfield to get the half inch.</v>

2766
02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Those guys who are doing those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like is that a mandatory thing?</v>

2767
02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:03.830
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to do it to work at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>company?</v>

2768
02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:05.630
<v Speaker 2>To the group meditation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

2769
02:04:05.660 --> 02:04:06.860
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2770
02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:11.300
<v Speaker 2>that'd be annoying if I think it'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>good once you fucking got into it.</v>

2771
02:04:11.380 --> 02:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Maybe even if you didn't learn how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe like fucking meditation.</v>

2772
02:04:14.661 --> 02:04:16.940
<v Speaker 2>If somebody carved out like we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>it on,</v>

2773
02:04:16.941 --> 02:04:17.774
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause were not only allowed to work out </v>

2774
02:04:19.431 --> 02:04:21.140
<v Speaker 2>on the clock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're encouraged to.</v>

2775
02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:23.480
<v Speaker 2>That's encouraged to use a sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're encouraged,</v>

2776
02:04:23.481 --> 02:04:24.314
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a fucking meditation room that </v>

2777
02:04:24.951 --> 02:04:25.784
<v Speaker 2>I'll go hit and meditate for 30 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm outside with my shirt off </v>

2778
02:04:28.791 --> 02:04:32.030
<v Speaker 2>barefoot doing Tai Chi and weird shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>dude all the time.</v>

2779
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:33.620
<v Speaker 2>And that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2780
02:04:33.621 --> 02:04:35.810
<v Speaker 2>So that culture that's created there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

2781
02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.920
<v Speaker 2>There's nap pods at Google for a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

2782
02:04:38.030 --> 02:04:40.800
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you had that scheduled in to where</v>

2783
02:04:40.801 --> 02:04:43.770
<v Speaker 4>you were going to meditate every fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>day on the clock and you knew like,</v>

2784
02:04:43.771 --> 02:04:47.430
<v Speaker 4>this is my time to rest and and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>

2785
02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:48.413
<v Speaker 4>get silent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think over time you'd buy into that </v>

2786
02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:53.670
<v Speaker 4>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd learn how or you would say,</v>

2787
02:04:53.671 --> 02:04:56.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking accountant and I came to </v>
<v Speaker 4>this building to work,</v>

2788
02:04:56.911 --> 02:04:57.744
<v Speaker 4>not to have some fucking cult member,</v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole guru who try it was probably </v>

2789
02:05:01.621 --> 02:05:03.510
<v Speaker 4>just trying to fuck everybody thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>down the street.</v>

2790
02:05:04.770 --> 02:05:07.830
<v Speaker 4>When I can meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I meditate on my own time.</v>

2791
02:05:07.831 --> 02:05:09.030
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm here to work.</v>

2792
02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:10.560
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need that extra 10 minutes.</v>

2793
02:05:10.561 --> 02:05:11.394
<v Speaker 4>He told me most of the people in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>companies still have a meditation </v>

2794
02:05:13.141 --> 02:05:16.860
<v Speaker 4>practice outside off the clock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would tell him that too if I wanted to</v>

2795
02:05:16.861 --> 02:05:18.620
<v Speaker 4>raise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2796
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:20.510
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met a tape for four hours when I'm out</v>

2797
02:05:20.511 --> 02:05:21.301
<v Speaker 4>of here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bro.</v>

2798
02:05:21.301 --> 02:05:24.000
<v Speaker 4>I meditate about you and how amazing an </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing leader you are,</v>

2799
02:05:24.001 --> 02:05:25.460
<v Speaker 4>just so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my gosh.</v>

2800
02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:30.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2801
02:05:30.001 --> 02:05:34.290
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think there's be some people that</v>

2802
02:05:34.291 --> 02:05:34.611
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2803
02:05:34.611 --> 02:05:36.510
<v Speaker 4>I guess if you let them know before they</v>
<v Speaker 4>took the job,</v>

2804
02:05:36.511 --> 02:05:37.950
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing we requires,</v>

2805
02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:40.560
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes of meditation every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You cool with that?</v>

2806
02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:41.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take it.</v>

2807
02:05:41.370 --> 02:05:42.330
<v Speaker 4>But what if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2808
02:05:42.331 --> 02:05:45.000
<v Speaker 4>like I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people gravitate towards that.</v>

2809
02:05:45.001 --> 02:05:47.730
<v Speaker 4>There's likeminded individuals that </v>
<v Speaker 4>every fucking company,</v>

2810
02:05:47.731 --> 02:05:49.020
<v Speaker 4>unless you just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need money.</v>

2811
02:05:49.021 --> 02:05:51.090
<v Speaker 4>And usually those people get weeded out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the equation.</v>

2812
02:05:51.120 --> 02:05:51.600
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well on,</v>

2813
02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:53.220
<v Speaker 4>it's a great example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you go there,</v>

2814
02:05:53.221 --> 02:05:58.020
<v Speaker 4>everybody's super positive fit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very friendly,</v>

2815
02:05:58.080 --> 02:06:00.570
<v Speaker 4>very friendly environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no dickie,</v>

2816
02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:02.430
<v Speaker 4>they all fucking enjoy what they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing to,</v>

2817
02:06:02.431 --> 02:06:04.530
<v Speaker 4>and if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they see themselves out.</v>

2818
02:06:04.531 --> 02:06:05.364
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2819
02:06:05.670 --> 02:06:06.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think having,</v>

2820
02:06:06.930 --> 02:06:08.520
<v Speaker 4>there's no company you're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>work at.</v>

2821
02:06:08.521 --> 02:06:09.354
<v Speaker 4>We're a 100% of the people are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>dialed in and they're all on the same </v>

2822
02:06:11.161 --> 02:06:12.810
<v Speaker 4>page and know we're going to change the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

2823
02:06:12.960 --> 02:06:13.793
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you have a high percentage that </v>

2824
02:06:15.211 --> 02:06:16.110
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are doing that,</v>

2825
02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:17.850
<v Speaker 4>that's why how you see big changes </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

2826
02:06:18.030 --> 02:06:19.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get a hundred employees,</v>

2827
02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:20.933
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have a little chaos a </v>

2828
02:06:22.471 --> 02:06:23.304
<v Speaker 4>little bit.</v>

2829
02:06:25.250 --> 02:06:26.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have that,</v>

2830
02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:29.520
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have Jewish agenda to </v>
<v Speaker 4>mike in front of everybody.</v>

2831
02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:33.210
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to have craziness,</v>

2832
02:06:33.211 --> 02:06:34.044
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have people that don't work together </v>

2833
02:06:34.951 --> 02:06:35.784
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't like each other because of </v>

2834
02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:40.980
<v Speaker 4>preexisting biases because of who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2835
02:06:40.981 --> 02:06:41.814
<v Speaker 4>They remind them of an X.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are weird getting men and women </v>

2836
02:06:45.031 --> 02:06:48.090
<v Speaker 4>to work together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just this to pull that off alone.</v>

2837
02:06:48.980 --> 02:06:50.610
<v Speaker 4>Whew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2838
02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:52.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We got hr now at on it.</v>

2839
02:06:52.380 --> 02:06:54.210
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that like?</v>

2840
02:06:54.630 --> 02:06:55.463
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a comparison because it's </v>

2841
02:06:57.421 --> 02:07:00.600
<v Speaker 4>my first real job where I get to play an</v>
<v Speaker 4>adult.</v>

2842
02:07:00.660 --> 02:07:05.220
<v Speaker 4>So you have a person who's hired to make</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure that no shenanigans take place well</v>

2843
02:07:05.221 --> 02:07:09.290
<v Speaker 4>just to create a pipeline for people to </v>
<v Speaker 4>talk to one another or you know,</v>

2844
02:07:09.590 --> 02:07:12.840
<v Speaker 4>a pipeline where you can handle things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2845
02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:14.190
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in an inappropriate manner.</v>

2846
02:07:14.190 --> 02:07:15.023
<v Speaker 4>So if someone takes offense to something</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we all had to go through this </v>

<v Speaker 4>beginning.</v>

<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2885
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:50.770
<v Speaker 4>That's the fuck initial problem is if </v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to cut all sexual harassment,</v>

2886
02:08:50.800 --> 02:08:53.800
<v Speaker 4>which we all do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to cut fun,</v>

02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:56.260
<v Speaker 4>but how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2888
02:08:56.261 --> 02:08:57.094
<v Speaker 4>especially like a guy who's saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that he thinks is funny to a </v>

2889
02:09:01.841 --> 02:09:02.674
<v Speaker 4>girl and it just really hurts her </v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings and he was just trying to be </v>

2890
02:09:05.741 --> 02:09:07.840
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that's in her eyes,</v>

2891
02:09:07.841 --> 02:09:10.150
<v Speaker 4>sexual harassment in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a joke.</v>

2892
02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:12.400
<v Speaker 4>Well it's even when everybody's eyes is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a disaster.</v>

2893
02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Any,</v>

2894
02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:14.073
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2895
02:09:14.350 --> 02:09:16.210
<v Speaker 4>it goes into all things like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I fuck with Aubrey's assistant a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ian,</v>

2897
02:09:19.450 --> 02:09:21.340
<v Speaker 4>he's a good buddy of mine and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2898
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:23.200
<v Speaker 4>I treat him like my little brother </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>

2899
02:09:23.201 --> 02:09:25.480
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at this joke it is always a joke.</v>

2900
02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:26.333
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we had this team meeting on the </v>

2901
02:09:27.311 --> 02:09:28.144
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu mats and he's sitting next to me</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the second we broke after the </v>

2902

<v Speaker 4>we're on the fucking match,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pitch your mind.</v>

2905
02:09:36.190 --> 02:09:38.470
<v Speaker 4>And I'm digging my knees into his Shin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like doing some,</v>

2906
02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:39.393
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like dirty Jujitsu and I forgot the leg </v>

2907
02:09:41.951 --> 02:09:44.500
<v Speaker 4>I was on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had just fucked up in soccer.</v>

2908
02:09:45.030 --> 02:09:46.570
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2909
02:09:46.571 --> 02:09:48.070
<v Speaker 4>dude's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2910
02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:50.830
<v Speaker 4>he's on fucking crutches for a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2911
02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:52.030
<v Speaker 4>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

2912
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:52.863
<v Speaker 4>I would clown them a little bit about </v>
<v Speaker 4>being on crutches and here comes the </v>

2913
02:09:55.451 --> 02:09:56.284
<v Speaker 4>gimp and is my boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I realized after watching this </v>

2914
02:09:58.151 --> 02:09:58.570
<v Speaker 4>video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2915
02:09:58.570 --> 02:09:59.403
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just as illegal as sexual </v>

2916
02:10:00.431 --> 02:10:01.960
<v Speaker 4>harassment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

2917
02:10:01.961 --> 02:10:02.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd,</v>

2918
02:10:02.410 --> 02:10:04.030
<v Speaker 4>I'd make a joke about that too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2919
02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:05.193
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ian,</v>

2920
02:10:05.500 --> 02:10:07.720
<v Speaker 4>nobody's allowed to make fun of you for </v>
<v Speaker 4>being disabled.</v>

2921
02:10:07.721 --> 02:10:09.940
<v Speaker 4>That's against the law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you can go to hr for that.</v>

2922
02:10:09.941 --> 02:10:11.980
<v Speaker 4>So if anybody does that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2923
02:10:12.010 --> 02:10:13.690
<v Speaker 4>you can go see something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's okay.</v>

2924
02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:16.030
<v Speaker 4>And that was kind of our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2925
02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:16.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's five Joe,</v>

2926
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:18.790
<v Speaker 4>he's my fucking boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can do that.</v>

2927
02:10:18.791 --> 02:10:21.100
<v Speaker 4>But that's still illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2928
02:10:21.101 --> 02:10:22.500
<v Speaker 4>And that I should be saying to you right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

2929
02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:24.550
<v Speaker 4>Well see the thing is if you have good </v>
<v Speaker 4>friends,</v>

2930
02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:25.743
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's what we were talking about earlier </v>

2931
02:10:26.471 --> 02:10:27.304
<v Speaker 4>with like Comedians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>good friends say fucked up shit to each </v>

2932
02:10:29.381 --> 02:10:33.230
<v Speaker 4>other for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's fun for both of them because if</v>

2933
02:10:33.231 --> 02:10:34.460
<v Speaker 4>you have a real friend,</v>

2934
02:10:34.790 --> 02:10:35.623
<v Speaker 5>do you love each other so much?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know that he hasn't really think </v>

2935
02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:41.330
<v Speaker 5>terrible things about you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he could say funny,</v>

2936
02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:45.260
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous shit like that because it'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>make both of you laugh because you know,</v>

2937
02:10:45.261 --> 02:10:47.450
<v Speaker 5>it's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you thought it any way,</v>

2938
02:10:47.451 --> 02:10:52.370
<v Speaker 5>it was the case that you really were </v>
<v Speaker 5>like mocking him in any way,</v>

2939
02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:55.520
<v Speaker 5>then it would never be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But because you never capable of that.</v>

2940
02:10:55.521 --> 02:10:56.930
<v Speaker 5>It's very funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I don't think,</v>

2941
02:10:56.931 --> 02:10:57.764
<v Speaker 5>I think the real issue comes down to </v>
<v Speaker 5>people who are looking to be offended </v>

2942
02:11:01.610 --> 02:11:02.443
<v Speaker 5>that fucking terrible at telling jokes </v>
<v Speaker 5>because people who are terrible at </v>

2943
02:11:06.111 --> 02:11:08.330
<v Speaker 5>joking around with people and they make </v>
<v Speaker 5>people uncomfortable.</v>

2944
02:11:08.680 --> 02:11:10.970
<v Speaker 5>But there's some people in the room that</v>
<v Speaker 5>won't laugh at anything.</v>

2945
02:11:11.140 --> 02:11:11.973
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's true.</v>

2946
02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:13.490
<v Speaker 5>Fucking looking for shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2947
02:11:13.491 --> 02:11:14.360
<v Speaker 5>And there's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2948
02:11:14.361 --> 02:11:15.194
<v Speaker 5>If you have a company like how the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 5>do decide who to hire and not to hire </v>

2949
02:11:18.141 --> 02:11:20.240
<v Speaker 5>because you don't know these people in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the beginning.</v>

2950
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:21.103
<v Speaker 5>Like sometimes people are one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then they get a little power and then </v>

2951
02:11:24.051 --> 02:11:26.600
<v Speaker 5>they become something different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just become a different thing.</v>

2952
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:27.583
<v Speaker 5>And then they get like ambitious or who </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows that life changes in some way and </v>

2953
02:11:30.981 --> 02:11:33.020
<v Speaker 5>then they get aggressive and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>

2954
02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:33.891
<v Speaker 5>they're different person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2955
02:11:33.891 --> 02:11:34.724
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who are you that we hired five years </v>

2956
02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:37.700
<v Speaker 5>ago?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now we have to figure out a fucking exit</v>

2957
02:11:37.701 --> 02:11:40.820
<v Speaker 5>strategy to get you out of the company.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fuck.</v>

2958
02:11:40.850 --> 02:11:41.683
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen many friends go sideways on </v>

2959
02:11:44.451 --> 02:11:45.284
<v Speaker 5>situations like that where they started </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing business together and then the </v>

2960
02:11:47.631 --> 02:11:50.150
<v Speaker 5>business takes off or it doesn't take </v>
<v Speaker 5>off and whatever,</v>

2961
02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.093
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're stuck together and then they're </v>

2962
02:11:52.371 --> 02:11:55.220
<v Speaker 5>not the same person who they were 10 </v>
<v Speaker 5>years ago when they started this fucking</v>

2963
02:11:55.221 --> 02:11:56.054
<v Speaker 5>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's all this weirdness and </v>

2964
02:11:57.081 --> 02:11:58.850
<v Speaker 5>resentment and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2965
02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:01.390
<v Speaker 5>hopefully no one's the same person they </v>
<v Speaker 5>were 10 years ago.</v>

2966
02:12:01.490 --> 02:12:02.323
<v Speaker 5>Hopefully you fucking grow and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>positive thing or it's not always the </v>

2967
02:12:05.301 --> 02:12:06.134
<v Speaker 5>case.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could be you growing and them not or </v>

2968
02:12:07.791 --> 02:12:09.410
<v Speaker 5>them and you not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2969
02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:12.110
<v Speaker 5>it's not uniform either.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the other thing.</v>

2970
02:12:12.111 --> 02:12:13.880
<v Speaker 5>It's like if you find like minded </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2971
02:12:13.881 --> 02:12:18.770
<v Speaker 5>the great thing about it is everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying their best to be a good person to</v>

2972
02:12:18.771 --> 02:12:19.970
<v Speaker 5>be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to take care of their body.</v>

2973
02:12:19.971 --> 02:12:20.804
<v Speaker 5>They're trying their best.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's going to be some hills and </v>

2974
02:12:21.471 --> 02:12:23.420
<v Speaker 5>valleys and ups and downs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but for the most part,</v>

2975
02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:26.720
<v Speaker 5>the thought process is about trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>be your best always,</v>

2976
02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:28.400
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're around those people,</v>

2977
02:12:28.401 --> 02:12:31.610
<v Speaker 5>like everybody's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you're around the people that are</v>

2978
02:12:31.611 --> 02:12:32.444
<v Speaker 5>fucking super negative about stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 5>always sabotaging the life and always </v>

2979
02:12:37.101 --> 02:12:40.730
<v Speaker 5>fucking up things for friends around </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and always ruining this and fucking</v>

2980
02:12:40.731 --> 02:12:42.560
<v Speaker 5>up that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2981
02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:46.670
<v Speaker 5>that can be exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that can steal your DNA,</v>

2982
02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:50.020
<v Speaker 5>that steals your fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2983
02:12:50.070 --> 02:12:52.820
<v Speaker 5>the whatever it is that makes you a </v>
<v Speaker 5>person,</v>

2984
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.863
<v Speaker 5>that feeling that you can when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>around someone that's just fucking up </v>

2985
02:12:55.761 --> 02:12:57.560
<v Speaker 5>all the time where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2986
02:12:58.280 --> 02:12:59.750
<v Speaker 5>it's exhausting.</v>

2987
02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.670
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of the deal to where he just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2988
02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:05.060
<v Speaker 5>if it is family or somebody care about,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just love them at a distance.</v>

2989
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:06.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've got to remove yourself from that.</v>

2990
02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:07.903
<v Speaker 5>You can't get wrapped up this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there are certain family members that </v>

2991
02:13:10.730 --> 02:13:12.680
<v Speaker 5>they go crazy and you can't get wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

2992
02:13:12.850 --> 02:13:14.210
<v Speaker 5>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll take you down,</v>

2993
02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:17.060
<v Speaker 5>they'll take you down with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't live two lives simultaneously.</v>

2994
02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:19.850
<v Speaker 5>You do your best if people want to go </v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>

2995
02:13:19.851 --> 02:13:24.851
<v Speaker 5>And that's always been my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my real fear and concern that when,</v>

2996
02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:26.473
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone that I know well does the drug </v>

2997
02:13:28.611 --> 02:13:31.100
<v Speaker 5>thing goes down the drug,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the drug hole,</v>

2998
02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 5>the wall,</v>

2999
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:32.813
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you see like something like what </v>

3000
02:13:33.511 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 3>are you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you doing [inaudible] and Tao?</v>

3001
02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:36.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing nothing.</v>

3002
02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.140
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

3003
02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.050
<v Speaker 3>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we got a tweaker over here.</v>

3004
02:13:40.230 --> 02:13:42.120
<v Speaker 3>We lost a homeboy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's tweaking.</v>

3005
02:13:42.310 --> 02:13:43.350
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not even himself.</v>

3006
02:13:43.351 --> 02:13:45.690
<v Speaker 3>And then when I was going to lie to us </v>
<v Speaker 3>about whether or not he's taken math,</v>

3007
02:13:47.850 --> 02:13:49.800
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen shit like that in college.</v>

3008
02:13:49.980 --> 02:13:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Lost a friend of heroin a while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost two friends to heroin,</v>

3009
02:13:52.921 --> 02:13:56.910
<v Speaker 3>gain one back and he got fucking clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not fun.</v>

3010
02:13:57.060 --> 02:13:57.893
<v Speaker 3>That's the rough one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To witness people that are willing to </v>

3011
02:13:59.611 --> 02:14:02.760
<v Speaker 3>stick a needle in their arm right into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the vein.</v>

3012
02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:06.173
<v Speaker 3>There's the romantic thing about it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>some people that this is the ultimate </v>

3013
02:14:09.061 --> 02:14:11.640
<v Speaker 3>fuck you to safety.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the,</v>

3014
02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:12.593
<v Speaker 3>the fuck you to the standard norms the </v>
<v Speaker 3>society's put on you and you stick that </v>

3015
02:14:17.851 --> 02:14:19.920
<v Speaker 3>needle in you and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

3016
02:14:20.770 --> 02:14:25.770
<v Speaker 3>untie that strap fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a crazy thing to do.</v>

3017
02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.830
<v Speaker 3>Ari Shaffir had a good point on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

3018
02:14:28.831 --> 02:14:31.440
<v Speaker 3>He was looking at a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what he was talking about it,</v>

3019
02:14:31.441 --> 02:14:32.274
<v Speaker 3>but he said he saw a homeless man and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>realized the guy was on some fucked up </v>

3020
02:14:35.431 --> 02:14:36.750
<v Speaker 3>drugs and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3021
02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:38.333
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were just introduced to the wrong </v>

3022
02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:40.794
<v Speaker 3>drugs is already does a lot of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he has drugs that help elevate him </v>

3023
02:14:45.301 --> 02:14:46.134
<v Speaker 3>and lift him to a new spot and give them</v>
<v Speaker 3>new perspective and hope and joy and </v>

3024
02:14:49.651 --> 02:14:50.484
<v Speaker 3>this other guy just got fucking suck </v>
<v Speaker 3>deep down the rabbit hole in the wrong </v>

3025
02:14:53.311 --> 02:14:54.144
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>

3026
02:14:54.300 --> 02:14:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3027
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.863
<v Speaker 3>I think in some ways that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in some ways they liked the heroin </v>

3028
02:15:00.691 --> 02:15:02.430
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3029
02:15:02.431 --> 02:15:05.640
<v Speaker 3>Who was it that had that statement about</v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin?</v>

3030
02:15:05.700 --> 02:15:06.533
<v Speaker 3>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a,</v>

3031
02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:07.913
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going to remember it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was a fascinating statement </v>

3032
02:15:10.591 --> 02:15:14.670
<v Speaker 3>about heroin killing you that what the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it was killing you,</v>

3033
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:17.670
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was lenny bruce talking about</v>

3034
02:15:17.671 --> 02:15:19.440
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that it was,</v>

3035
02:15:19.500 --> 02:15:24.500
<v Speaker 3>it was such a sweet death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really forget the quote because heroin</v>

3036
02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.420
<v Speaker 3>is something I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it freaks me out so much.</v>

3037
02:15:27.421 --> 02:15:29.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like reading too much about</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3038
02:15:29.250 --> 02:15:32.460
<v Speaker 3>I like read a few things here or about </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that are hooked on it.</v>

3039
02:15:32.461 --> 02:15:34.440
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it creeps me out so much.</v>

3040
02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:35.293
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like I'm reading about </v>

3041
02:15:35.821 --> 02:15:38.790
<v Speaker 3>demonic possession and in a way I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is and the way,</v>

3042
02:15:38.791 --> 02:15:41.340
<v Speaker 3>I think when people lose their entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>life to some pills,</v>

3043
02:15:41.341 --> 02:15:42.120
<v Speaker 3>they can't stop.</v>

3044
02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:44.700
<v Speaker 3>They lose their family and lose their </v>
<v Speaker 3>job and they just can't stop.</v>

3045
02:15:44.701 --> 02:15:45.534
<v Speaker 3>They keep taking it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How is that really any different in </v>

3046
02:15:48.391 --> 02:15:49.224
<v Speaker 3>terms of the overall results and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>effect it has on your loved ones and </v>

3047
02:15:53.101 --> 02:15:55.170
<v Speaker 3>your friends and your family and </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself?</v>

3048
02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:56.093
<v Speaker 3>How's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any different than just a really evil </v>

3049
02:15:57.631 --> 02:15:58.464
<v Speaker 3>demon that t talks you into staying home</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day and makes you throw up and it's </v>

3050
02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:04.290
<v Speaker 3>just fucking with you all day and making</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tired.</v>

3051
02:16:04.291 --> 02:16:07.020
<v Speaker 3>Just dragging you to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>making you fall asleep right in front of</v>

3052
02:16:07.021 --> 02:16:08.370
<v Speaker 3>the sink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How was any,</v>

3053
02:16:08.371 --> 02:16:10.020
<v Speaker 3>if there was a demon doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3054
02:16:10.050 --> 02:16:11.010
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look at him.</v>

3055
02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:15.720
<v Speaker 3>He's possessed by a demon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be horrible if we just saw some kid</v>

3056
02:16:15.721 --> 02:16:16.650
<v Speaker 3>who was just his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

3057
02:16:16.651 --> 02:16:19.890
<v Speaker 3>his body's all fucked up cause he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>demon inside of them controlling it.</v>

3058
02:16:20.190 --> 02:16:21.210
<v Speaker 3>But instead we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>

3059
02:16:21.211 --> 02:16:23.850
<v Speaker 3>he's all fucked up cause he shot up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shot up.</v>

3060
02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:24.713
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll,</v>

3061
02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:26.820
<v Speaker 3>it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3062
02:16:26.821 --> 02:16:29.290
<v Speaker 3>It grabs people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the fucking problem though,</v>

3063
02:16:29.291 --> 02:16:30.940
<v Speaker 3>is that you look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

3064
02:16:31.210 --> 02:16:33.190
<v Speaker 3>I'll die young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like kissing God.</v>

3065
02:16:33.850 --> 02:16:34.683
<v Speaker 3>That was his expression of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who died of a morphine overdose on </v>

3066

<v Speaker 3>how would you recall a prehistoric human</v>
<v Speaker 3>human owned hominoid?</v>

3074
02:17:01.850 --> 02:17:02.683
<v Speaker 3>What was Lucy that was that I remember </v>
<v Speaker 3>when they discovered pithy kiss or </v>

3075
02:17:05.751 --> 02:17:07.100
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3076
02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:09.770
<v Speaker 3>That's what Lenny Bruce is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot second you said Lucy.</v>

3077
02:17:09.771 --> 02:17:11.180
<v Speaker 3>I was thinking to Lsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

3078
02:17:11.240 --> 02:17:12.590
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what you're talking about.</v>

3079
02:17:12.591 --> 02:17:13.550
<v Speaker 3>LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are,</v>

3080
02:17:13.551 --> 02:17:15.920
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lucy was on the cover of Nat Geo,</v>

3081
02:17:15.921 --> 02:17:16.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3082
02:17:16.400 --> 02:17:17.233
<v Speaker 3>It was like one of the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like early human skeletons that they </v>

3083
02:17:21.711 --> 02:17:22.544
<v Speaker 3>had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some controversy </v>

3084
02:17:22.911 --> 02:17:23.744
<v Speaker 3>attached to that thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which there always is to those ancient </v>

3085
02:17:27.291 --> 02:17:28.650
<v Speaker 3>humans that they find,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3086
02:17:28.651 --> 02:17:30.980
<v Speaker 3>you find a fucking human from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How long ago was Lucy?</v>

3087
02:17:31.340 --> 02:17:32.930
<v Speaker 3>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 3>2 million.</v>

3088
02:17:32.931 --> 02:17:34.640
<v Speaker 3>2.92</v>
<v Speaker 3>point 9 million.</v>

3089
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:38.300
<v Speaker 3>Let me see a picture that was us just </v>
<v Speaker 3>2.9</v>

3090
02:17:38.301 --> 02:17:42.170
<v Speaker 3>million years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

3091
02:17:43.630 --> 02:17:44.530
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3092
02:17:46.690 --> 02:17:50.530
<v Speaker 3>Would you fuck lucy if I had to for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>good of the human race,</v>

3093
02:17:51.250 --> 02:17:54.940
<v Speaker 3>if we need to make people who was asking</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they would fucking Neanderthal,</v>

3094
02:17:55.640 --> 02:17:56.473
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

3095
02:17:56.510 --> 02:17:57.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was it you,</v>

3096
02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:01.270
<v Speaker 3>the answer is yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The answer's fucking yes.</v>

3097
02:18:01.300 --> 02:18:02.133
<v Speaker 3>It happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I mean when it's functioning and </v>

3098
02:18:03.251 --> 02:18:04.084
<v Speaker 3>it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I mean by Lenny Bruce was this is </v>

3099
02:18:05.111 --> 02:18:06.340
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the first,</v>

3100
02:18:06.730 --> 02:18:09.670
<v Speaker 3>he's not like primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was like super advanced,</v>

3101
02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:12.130
<v Speaker 3>but he was the very first version of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3102
02:18:12.370 --> 02:18:15.490
<v Speaker 3>The very first version of a real standup</v>
<v Speaker 3>comedian like that.</v>

3103
02:18:15.491 --> 02:18:18.430
<v Speaker 3>Everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all lines come from Lenny Bruce.</v>

3104
02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:19.293
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of his contemporaries </v>

3105
02:18:19.991 --> 02:18:20.824
<v Speaker 3>that were really good too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a bunch of people from that </v>

3106
02:18:22.241 --> 02:18:26.380
<v Speaker 3>era that we're just all innovative and </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting thinkers in the all I'm sure</v>

3107
02:18:26.381 --> 02:18:29.320
<v Speaker 3>fed off of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But Lenny Bruce is almost like Lucy.</v>

3108
02:18:29.410 --> 02:18:30.640
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's almost like the first,</v>

3109
02:18:30.641 --> 02:18:33.550
<v Speaker 3>I'll try it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like the first real standup comic,</v>

3110
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:34.721
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we'd say,</v>

3111
02:18:34.721 --> 02:18:35.201
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3112
02:18:35.201 --> 02:18:36.034
<v Speaker 3>I get Mark Twain was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand that all these different </v>

3113
02:18:37.991 --> 02:18:42.991
<v Speaker 3>people had like a kind of comical way of</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking in front of people.</v>

3114
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:44.103
<v Speaker 3>But there was something about the way he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was analyzing and breaking down society </v>

3115
02:18:46.451 --> 02:18:47.510
<v Speaker 3>on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was,</v>

3116
02:18:47.590 --> 02:18:50.470
<v Speaker 3>this was the first of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you watch that and go,</v>

3117
02:18:50.471 --> 02:18:51.550
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's um,</v>

3118
02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:53.970
<v Speaker 3>that's like some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a,</v>

3119
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:56.290
<v Speaker 3>almost like a scientific discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3120
02:18:56.291 --> 02:18:57.124
<v Speaker 3>well this is now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is going to shift the culture this </v>

3121
02:18:59.231 --> 02:19:02.260
<v Speaker 3>way because now people are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>mocking things for free entertainment.</v>

3122
02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:03.213
<v Speaker 3>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side's going to get way more </v>

3123
02:19:04.151 --> 02:19:04.984
<v Speaker 3>mocking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to have your serious </v>

3124
02:19:05.861 --> 02:19:06.790
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's going to be,</v>

3125
02:19:06.791 --> 02:19:09.640
<v Speaker 3>is a business and making fun of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a new thing,</v>

3126
02:19:09.641 --> 02:19:10.474
<v Speaker 3>now this is a new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what that guy was just kind </v>

3127
02:19:13.691 --> 02:19:16.960
<v Speaker 3>of a trip and you really stop and think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about how influential one person can be.</v>

3128
02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:18.153
<v Speaker 3>You know that one person with some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>amount of talents and weird way of </v>

3129
02:19:21.821 --> 02:19:26.821
<v Speaker 3>looking at things can shift like all </v>
<v Speaker 3>across from right now.</v>

3130
02:19:28.140 --> 02:19:29.270
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy right here,</v>

<v Speaker 7>Can they all alone no more taking out </v>

3150

<v Speaker 7>the garbage here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Her on the phone.</v>

3151
02:20:40.391 --> 02:20:44.440
<v Speaker 7>I gave her everything,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even my mother's ring,</v>

3152
02:20:45.460 --> 02:20:50.050
<v Speaker 7>but to me she was so pulling some times </v>
<v Speaker 7>I wished that she worked at,</v>

3153
02:20:50.890 --> 02:20:52.960
<v Speaker 7>but it probably take her two hours to </v>
<v Speaker 7>get ready.</v>

3154
02:20:56.610 --> 02:20:57.443
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck this is probably like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have to guess like 1960 what </v>

3155
02:21:01.651 --> 02:21:04.110
<v Speaker 3>year was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did say?</v>

3156
02:21:05.330 --> 02:21:07.560
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wonder when that was.</v>

3157
02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:10.620
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be somewhere in that </v>
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>

3158
02:21:11.370 --> 02:21:15.450
<v Speaker 3>But that guy and big heroin problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3159
02:21:15.550 --> 02:21:16.020
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

3160
02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:17.580
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big heroin problem.</v>

3161
02:21:17.910 --> 02:21:20.310
<v Speaker 3>And he was also fighting against </v>
<v Speaker 3>censorship.</v>

3162
02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:21.173
<v Speaker 3>He was like one of the first people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was a public speaker that was </v>

3163
02:21:24.181 --> 02:21:26.790
<v Speaker 3>challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is a censorship in court.</v>

3164
02:21:26.880 --> 02:21:27.713
<v Speaker 3>He was getting arrested for doing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>nightclub performances and saying </v>

3165
02:21:30.091 --> 02:21:32.400
<v Speaker 3>certain words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3166
02:21:32.401 --> 02:21:33.234
<v Speaker 3>and he was talking about how ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>it is to put all the power in these </v>

3167
02:21:36.301 --> 02:21:37.860
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including racist words.</v>

3168
02:21:38.820 --> 02:21:40.770
<v Speaker 3>Nobody was doing anything like this back</v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

3169
02:21:40.771 --> 02:21:44.250
<v Speaker 3>It was crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of what he was doing,</v>

3170
02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:45.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>

3171
02:21:45.391 --> 02:21:46.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sanity.</v>

3172
02:21:46.110 --> 02:21:46.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of what he was doing was he was a </v>

3173
02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:54.930
<v Speaker 3>big believer and expanding his </v>
<v Speaker 3>consciousness.</v>

3174
02:21:54.930 --> 02:21:56.750
<v Speaker 3>He was getting fucked up a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

3175
02:21:56.880 --> 02:21:57.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing obviously doing heroin </v>

3176
02:21:59.671 --> 02:22:01.740
<v Speaker 3>because he died of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about it pretty openly,</v>

3177
02:22:02.370 --> 02:22:03.203
<v Speaker 3>but who knows what else he was doing to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think marijuana was involved in there </v>

3178
02:22:05.161 --> 02:22:07.710
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's expanding his mind and it's strange</v>

3179
02:22:07.711 --> 02:22:10.320
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's impossible for us to really</v>

3180
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:15.830
<v Speaker 3>put ourselves in the mindset of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who lived in the 1950s in 19 early 1960s</v>

3181
02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:17.153
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think we're capable of </v>

3182
02:22:17.671 --> 02:22:20.400
<v Speaker 3>doing it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have like a vh one depiction of that.</v>

3183
02:22:20.401 --> 02:22:22.860
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever see the the decades?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3184
02:22:22.920 --> 02:22:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Where they had been through the sixties </v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventies eighties and nineties that</v>

3185
02:22:26.251 --> 02:22:27.084
<v Speaker 3>was pretty fucking Rad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's still a Hollywood version of </v>

3186
02:22:29.401 --> 02:22:30.750
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>100% you know,</v>

3187
02:22:31.530 --> 02:22:35.130
<v Speaker 3>even when they get to the eighties you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know like go canes are surgeons and it's</v>

3188
02:22:35.131 --> 02:22:35.964
<v Speaker 3>all fucking Madonna and prince and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>so silly back to the future and shit </v>

3189
02:22:39.121 --> 02:22:39.900
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

3190
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:42.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't think we can imagine what it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have been like growing up then.</v>

3191
02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:44.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>living in his era,</v>

3192
02:22:45.090 --> 02:22:50.090
<v Speaker 3>like people were so buttoned down to </v>
<v Speaker 3>have some guy come along and go,</v>

3193
02:22:50.851 --> 02:22:53.040
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are we doing it like this now?</v>

3194
02:22:53.070 --> 02:22:53.910
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3195
02:22:54.960 --> 02:22:59.310
<v Speaker 3>that's a crazy thing that standup comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>started in America.</v>

3196
02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:02.490
<v Speaker 3>It really did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was definitely gestures and</v>

3197
02:23:02.880 --> 02:23:03.713
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>King Arthur's days and all that </v>

3198
02:23:05.551 --> 02:23:06.384
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And from the beginning of time people </v>

3199
02:23:08.071 --> 02:23:08.904
<v Speaker 3>have had court jesters and there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>always been funny people in the village </v>

3200
02:23:11.281 --> 02:23:12.114
<v Speaker 3>that everybody gathered round like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>Joey Diaz type character that lives </v>

3201
02:23:14.851 --> 02:23:16.760
<v Speaker 3>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this,</v>

3202
02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:19.590
<v Speaker 3>the art of stand up comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that was the first,</v>

3203
02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:20.513
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3204
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:22.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe it's Mark Twain,</v>

3205
02:23:22.591 --> 02:23:24.360
<v Speaker 3>but if it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not mark Twain,</v>

3206
02:23:24.390 --> 02:23:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3207
02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:30.960
<v Speaker 3>that was the first one where people </v>
<v Speaker 3>started wanting to be that and then they</v>

3208
02:23:30.961 --> 02:23:31.794
<v Speaker 3>kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot of that coming off of </v>

3209
02:23:32.611 --> 02:23:33.490
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3210
02:23:33.491 --> 02:23:34.324
<v Speaker 3>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these little branches get taken off the </v>

3211
02:23:36.451 --> 02:23:39.660
<v Speaker 3>main river and culture occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3212
02:23:39.661 --> 02:23:40.494
<v Speaker 3>and I think a lot of that was what I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>reading in the Malcolm Gladwell book </v>

3213
02:23:43.981 --> 02:23:46.020
<v Speaker 3>that was talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was the tipping point,</v>

3214
02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:46.913
<v Speaker 3>tipping point.</v>

3215
02:23:46.920 --> 02:23:49.000
<v Speaker 3>It's about different trends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like real,</v>

3216
02:23:49.230 --> 02:23:50.700
<v Speaker 3>real specific stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what,</v>

3217
02:23:50.730 --> 02:23:51.563
<v Speaker 3>what caused this a uptick and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>syphilis in one part of the country and </v>

3218
02:23:58.351 --> 02:24:00.120
<v Speaker 3>like what caught,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what are these,</v>

3219
02:24:00.121 --> 02:24:00.954
<v Speaker 3>all these factors that fall in place </v>
<v Speaker 3>that all work synergistically and push </v>

3220
02:24:05.611 --> 02:24:06.444
<v Speaker 3>something over the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How did hush puppies go from a business </v>

3221
02:24:08.191 --> 02:24:11.790
<v Speaker 3>that was like almost bankrupt to being </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that will like everywhere.</v>

3222
02:24:11.791 --> 02:24:12.624
<v Speaker 3>And then there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in two years they had stores opened in </v>

3223
02:24:14.041 --> 02:24:16.620
<v Speaker 3>every mall and they were closed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3224
02:24:16.621 --> 02:24:18.420
<v Speaker 3>they were um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open,</v>

3225
02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:21.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for decades without this kind of success</v>

3226
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:22.423
<v Speaker 3>and something happened and they became </v>
<v Speaker 3>this hip thing to have hush puppies on </v>

3227
02:24:25.890 --> 02:24:26.723
<v Speaker 3>and then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the business just explodes out of </v>

3228
02:24:27.661 --> 02:24:28.494
<v Speaker 3>nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And did these weird moments like that </v>

3229
02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.050
<v Speaker 3>sometimes like an elan musk type </v>
<v Speaker 3>character,</v>

3230
02:24:32.051 --> 02:24:34.140
<v Speaker 3>it comes along and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3231
02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:36.600
<v Speaker 3>I want to fucking put people on Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make an electric car,</v>

3232
02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:38.610
<v Speaker 3>I want to puck shoot tunnels under the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

3233
02:24:38.611 --> 02:24:39.444
<v Speaker 3>Like one of these characters comes along</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then through them there's like this </v>

3234
02:24:42.451 --> 02:24:45.540
<v Speaker 3>new river and all this new crazy shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens.</v>

3235
02:24:46.050 --> 02:24:47.320
<v Speaker 3>That guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was,</v>

3236
02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:48.233
<v Speaker 3>that guy was probably the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number one for standup comedy for </v>

3237
02:24:50.131 --> 02:24:50.964
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

3238
02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:53.600
<v Speaker 3>fucking massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3239
02:24:53.601 --> 02:24:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Pretty crazy shit dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever see,</v>

3240
02:24:56.571 --> 02:24:58.580
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the name of it?</v>

3241
02:24:58.900 --> 02:25:01.790
<v Speaker 3>This is the touring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the turing test.</v>

3242
02:25:01.791 --> 02:25:02.624
<v Speaker 3>The Turing Turing test is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not you could tell if </v>

3243
02:25:04.611 --> 02:25:06.500
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence is human.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3244
02:25:06.501 --> 02:25:07.334
<v Speaker 3>It's not the turing test.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the movie about the guy who </v>

3245
02:25:08.751 --> 02:25:10.220
<v Speaker 3>invented the computer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Turing.</v>

3246
02:25:10.640 --> 02:25:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the British dude.</v>

3247
02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:15.673
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3248
02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:17.100
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh wait,</v>

3249
02:25:17.101 --> 02:25:19.560
<v Speaker 3>are you talking about x mocking or like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the one about it?</v>

3250
02:25:19.561 --> 02:25:21.990
<v Speaker 3>Like the imitation game or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like the invitation game?</v>

3251
02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking</v>

3252
02:25:24.010 --> 02:25:26.830
<v Speaker 2>nuts to think like if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you watched that movie and obviously,</v>

3253
02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:27.910
<v Speaker 2>have you seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3254
02:25:28.090 --> 02:25:30.310
<v Speaker 2>it's the imitation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

3255
02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:32.850
<v Speaker 2>That guy's a great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great fucking actor too.</v>

3256
02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:35.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm right in the show right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Dr Strange,</v>

3257
02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:37.780
<v Speaker 2>benedict cumberbatch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a savage,</v>

3258
02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:40.390
<v Speaker 2>but they go through that in that time </v>
<v Speaker 2>period.</v>

3259
02:25:41.350 --> 02:25:43.540
<v Speaker 2>He fucking invented the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer,</v>

3260
02:25:43.810 --> 02:25:45.430
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he goes through the time period</v>

3261
02:25:45.431 --> 02:25:46.264
<v Speaker 2>and he's gay in Britain and they put </v>
<v Speaker 2>them on medication that lowers his </v>

3262
02:25:49.961 --> 02:25:53.590
<v Speaker 2>testosterone so he won't be gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they won't have sex with men.</v>

3263
02:25:53.591 --> 02:25:56.290
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a hilarious toby.</v>

3264
02:25:56.500 --> 02:25:58.870
<v Speaker 2>But if you think about like people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>move the fucking needle,</v>

3265
02:25:58.871 --> 02:26:00.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people that change shift,</v>

3266
02:26:00.750 --> 02:26:01.583
<v Speaker 2>like if that's where it comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>computers and then we get to fucking </v>

3267
02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:09.670
<v Speaker 2>hyper-intelligent superintelligent ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all started there.</v>

3268
02:26:10.090 --> 02:26:10.890
<v Speaker 2>That is crazy</v>

3269
02:26:10.890 --> 02:26:11.641
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3270
02:26:11.641 --> 02:26:14.010
<v Speaker 3>there was a bunch of different factions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3271
02:26:14.011 --> 02:26:14.844
<v Speaker 3>Bunch of different people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>working on computers because a woman </v>

3272
02:26:16.531 --> 02:26:18.730
<v Speaker 3>created the very first computer code.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

3273
02:26:19.210 --> 02:26:20.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what her name was.</v>

3274
02:26:20.470 --> 02:26:21.220
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's two.</v>

3275
02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:24.880
<v Speaker 3>There's two pivotal inventions by women </v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

3276
02:26:24.881 --> 02:26:28.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in computer design and then ultimately,</v>

3277
02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:33.520
<v Speaker 3>and in the actual execution of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here it is Ada lovelace.</v>

3278
02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.140
<v Speaker 3>It's been called the world's first </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer programmer.</v>

3279
02:26:38.590 --> 02:26:42.850
<v Speaker 3>What she did was write the world's first</v>
<v Speaker 3>machine algorithm for an early computing</v>

3280
02:26:42.851 --> 02:26:45.580
<v Speaker 3>machine that existed only on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

3281
02:26:45.581 --> 02:26:48.340
<v Speaker 3>someone had to be the first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but lovelace was a woman and this was in</v>

3282
02:26:48.341 --> 02:26:53.341
<v Speaker 3>the 1840s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So suck it stupid people sock.</v>

3283
02:26:54.841 --> 02:26:56.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ada.</v>

3284
02:26:56.380 --> 02:27:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Ada was rocking shit in the 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's figuring it out.</v>

3285
02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:01.840
<v Speaker 3>Imagine you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

3286
02:27:01.841 --> 02:27:02.674
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day they're gonna be able to do </v>

3287
02:27:03.161 --> 02:27:03.994
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but right now they don't want to do it </v>

3288
02:27:04.590 --> 02:27:06.610
<v Speaker 3>if one day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they just figured out how to do this,</v>

3289
02:27:06.611 --> 02:27:07.444
<v Speaker 3>this is this and there's an that and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have computers and the </v>

3290
02:27:08.800 --> 02:27:12.010
<v Speaker 3>computers will operate on this algorithm</v>
<v Speaker 3>and people are looking at you like,</v>

3291
02:27:12.011 --> 02:27:13.840
<v Speaker 3>pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3292
02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:18.310
<v Speaker 3>Computers like imagined how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a hell it would be to be a super,</v>

3293
02:27:18.311 --> 02:27:20.440
<v Speaker 3>super genius living amongst the cave </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3294
02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:22.150
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucks,</v>

3295
02:27:22.151 --> 02:27:25.060
<v Speaker 3>we could be flying around if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>assholes knew how to melt aluminum.</v>

3296
02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:28.750
<v Speaker 3>Can you guys get me some glass?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know glass shit.</v>

3297
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:30.550
<v Speaker 3>Do you have any wires?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have no wire.</v>

3298
02:27:30.610 --> 02:27:33.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where do you get your metal?</v>

3299
02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:34.653
<v Speaker 3>You don't have metal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What shit you imagine if you like we're </v>

3300
02:27:38.831 --> 02:27:39.664
<v Speaker 3>looking at metal in the ground.</v>

3350
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:00.733
<v Speaker 5>but at least I'm not in a fucking cage </v>
<v Speaker 5>until my heart stops beating a hundred </v>

3351
02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:04.940
<v Speaker 5>percent I'd take that all day.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'll die for sure,</v>

3354
02:30:08.030 --> 02:30:12.140
<v Speaker 5>but I'll dive running or trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 5>away or you know,</v>

3355
02:30:12.980 --> 02:30:13.813
<v Speaker 5>break a leg.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know I'm not going to die in that </v>

3356
02:30:15.261 --> 02:30:18.800
<v Speaker 5>box.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the craziest thing about you,</v>

3357
02:30:18.801 --> 02:30:22.190
<v Speaker 5>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just decide when someone has crossed</v>

3358
02:30:22.191 --> 02:30:23.024
<v Speaker 5>some line that you're were going to take</v>
<v Speaker 5>you out of circulation and we're just </v>

3359
02:30:26.511 --> 02:30:27.344

<v Speaker 5>Like what a stupid idea.</v>

3361
02:30:34.191 --> 02:30:36.620
<v Speaker 5>It's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how you know it's a stupid idea.</v>

3362
02:30:37.130 --> 02:30:39.200
<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not working for anyone.</v>

3363
02:30:39.320 --> 02:30:42.830
<v Speaker 5>You want to protect people from violent </v>
<v Speaker 5>offenders.</v>

3364
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:44.510
<v Speaker 5>That's primary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3365
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.823
<v Speaker 5>Violent offenders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people who want to rob people or murder </v>

3366
02:30:50.241 --> 02:30:52.820
<v Speaker 5>people are raped.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People are assault people.</v>

3367
02:30:52.821 --> 02:30:55.380
<v Speaker 5>That is the number one thing is we want </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I love Jamie.</v>

3369
02:30:57.771 --> 02:30:58.604
<v Speaker 5>I don't want Jamie to have to worry when</v>
<v Speaker 5>he walks down the street that this guy </v>

3370
02:31:00.831 --> 02:31:01.664
<v Speaker 5>that they locked up 10 times going to </v>
<v Speaker 5>jump out of the bushes and take his </v>

3371
02:31:03.921 --> 02:31:07.190
<v Speaker 5>knees out with a baseball bat for no </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking reason other than he's crazy,</v>

3372
02:31:07.250 --> 02:31:08.090
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You don't want that.</v>

3373
02:31:08.091 --> 02:31:08.924
<v Speaker 5>Nobody wants that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we all agree you got to lock up </v>

3374
02:31:12.261 --> 02:31:14.510
<v Speaker 5>rapists and murderers and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But after that,</v>

3375
02:31:15.020 --> 02:31:16.730
<v Speaker 5>after get to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>after you get past that,</v>

3376
02:31:16.731 --> 02:31:17.960
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hmm,</v>

3377
02:31:18.470 --> 02:31:20.040
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What does it do</v>

3378
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:21.990
<v Speaker 3>to get that guy that cheated on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes?</v>

3379
02:31:21.991 --> 02:31:23.760
<v Speaker 3>Why do you put them in a cage for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year?</v>

3380
02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you let them work and pay you </v>
<v Speaker 3>back?</v>

3381
02:31:26.580 --> 02:31:28.530
<v Speaker 3>Like why is he in a cage for a year?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems,</v>

3382
02:31:29.040 --> 02:31:30.990
<v Speaker 3>that seems like you're punishing them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're,</v>

3383
02:31:30.991 --> 02:31:31.824
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just trying to torture him and </v>

3384
02:31:32.641 --> 02:31:35.220
<v Speaker 3>steal a year of his life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he'll just owes you money.</v>

3385
02:31:35.221 --> 02:31:37.830
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know you a year of his life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much does a year of your life worth?</v>

3386
02:31:38.100 --> 02:31:40.950
<v Speaker 3>It's worth fucking billions of dollars a</v>
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>

3387
02:31:40.960 --> 02:31:43.380
<v Speaker 3>Your Life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you man.</v>

3388
02:31:43.381 --> 02:31:45.720
<v Speaker 3>You can't take a year or someone's life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3389
02:31:46.470 --> 02:31:48.550
<v Speaker 3>But if you owe taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3390
02:31:48.580 --> 02:31:49.800
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd like a year of your life,</v>

3391
02:31:49.801 --> 02:31:52.110
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or if you're fucking selling plants,</v>

3392
02:31:52.140 --> 02:31:52.973
<v Speaker 3>sell implants or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're one of those people that didn't </v>

3393
02:31:55.860 --> 02:31:58.710
<v Speaker 3>send the envelope and trying to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that 4,000</v>

3394
02:31:58.711 --> 02:31:59.544
<v Speaker 3>pounds of cocaine over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what would be a good deterrent for come </v>

3395
02:32:03.391 --> 02:32:04.260
<v Speaker 3>from parts of stops?</v>

3396
02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:05.093
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think education is that the real </v>

3397
02:32:07.111 --> 02:32:09.480
<v Speaker 3>determined you have to catch them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to be punishment.</v>

3398
02:32:09.810 --> 02:32:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Like if you owe people money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there should be reparations.</v>

3399
02:32:12.270 --> 02:32:13.260
<v Speaker 3>You should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you,</v>

3400
02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:16.800
<v Speaker 3>if you were involved in some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>banking scheme and you rip people off,</v>

3401
02:32:16.801 --> 02:32:18.180
<v Speaker 3>you should have to pay those people </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

3402
02:32:18.181 --> 02:32:19.050
<v Speaker 3>Period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should have,</v>

3403
02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:21.570
<v Speaker 3>you should be responsible for that after</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3404
02:32:22.280 --> 02:32:23.113
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're assuming that someone's capable </v>

3405
02:32:24.811 --> 02:32:26.970
<v Speaker 3>of growing and sometimes we don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>

3406
02:32:26.971 --> 02:32:30.000
<v Speaker 3>It's very convenient to assume that </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone is in a static state and they're</v>

3407
02:32:30.001 --> 02:32:31.150
<v Speaker 3>never going to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3408
02:32:31.151 --> 02:32:31.984
<v Speaker 3>this old banker asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's just a ritual cut and this is how </v>

3409
02:32:34.531 --> 02:32:35.880
<v Speaker 3>he's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck him.</v>

3410
02:32:36.030 --> 02:32:37.020
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's that thing,</v>

3411
02:32:37.021 --> 02:32:40.440
<v Speaker 3>but he's a human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even if he lived his life,</v>

3412
02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:42.540
<v Speaker 3>fucking people over on those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3413
02:32:42.570 --> 02:32:43.403
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those weird mortgage situation loans </v>

3414
02:32:45.721 --> 02:32:46.554
<v Speaker 3>that were going on.</v>

3415
02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:48.390
<v Speaker 3>What were those things called?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>

3416
02:32:48.391 --> 02:32:50.100
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the adjustable arm.</v>

3417
02:32:50.610 --> 02:32:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the adjustable mortgages that people got</v>

3418
02:32:52.801 --> 02:32:53.634
<v Speaker 3>fucked on because they signed up for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and they were really low rate and </v>

3419
02:32:56.161 --> 02:32:56.994
<v Speaker 3>then also in their rate jacked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the roof and they were just </v>

3420
02:32:58.291 --> 02:32:59.124
<v Speaker 3>inevitably going to lose their house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this was like something that people </v>

3421
02:33:01.111 --> 02:33:01.944
<v Speaker 3>knew about it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even the people that organize that </v>

3422
02:33:03.031 --> 02:33:05.430
<v Speaker 3>kind of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even knowing they can grow,</v>

3423
02:33:05.820 --> 02:33:06.653
<v Speaker 3>it's a horrible thing they did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they used to say that they're done </v>

3424
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:10.800
<v Speaker 3>fucked damn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lock them up forever.</v>

3425
02:33:10.801 --> 02:33:14.430
<v Speaker 3>My grandma lost her house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible that your grandma lost her</v>

3426
02:33:14.431 --> 02:33:17.820
<v Speaker 3>house and whoever the fuck benefited </v>
<v Speaker 3>from your grandma losing the house,</v>

3427
02:33:17.821 --> 02:33:19.330
<v Speaker 3>they should all have to give that money </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to,</v>

3428
02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:20.233
<v Speaker 3>we should figure out the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How the fuck did they allow these banks </v>

3429
02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:23.580
<v Speaker 3>to weasel people like that.</v>

3430
02:33:23.580 --> 02:33:26.490
<v Speaker 3>You're not looking out for anybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>best interest when you do something like</v>

3431
02:33:26.491 --> 02:33:27.324
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>

3432
02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:29.310
<v Speaker 3>and obviously they didn't know they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to.</v>

3433
02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.570
<v Speaker 3>The rates are gonna get as high as they </v>
<v Speaker 3>got where people were.</v>

3434
02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they should all situations,</v>

3435
02:33:33.841 --> 02:33:34.674
<v Speaker 3>but they should've.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They should've known something was </v>

3436
02:33:35.581 --> 02:33:37.880
<v Speaker 3>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He hit the point though that they should</v>

3437
02:33:37.881 --> 02:33:39.960
<v Speaker 3>have succumbed in paid back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Either should've been paid,</v>

3438
02:33:39.961 --> 02:33:40.794
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>none of those fucking people got paid </v>

3439
02:33:41.371 --> 02:33:42.204
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't matter how long you locked </v>

3440
02:33:42.541 --> 02:33:43.374
<v Speaker 3>him up for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nobody fucking got their house </v>

3441
02:33:44.311 --> 02:33:45.440
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3442
02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:46.433
<v Speaker 3>Everyone got fucked over and even people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were involved in the organizations </v>

3443
02:33:49.531 --> 02:33:52.320
<v Speaker 3>that we're probably responsible in part </v>
<v Speaker 3>for the recession,</v>

3444
02:33:52.620 --> 02:33:53.860
<v Speaker 3>which fucked everything up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll it.</v>

3445
02:33:53.870 --> 02:33:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Those people got bonuses when there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>bailouts.</v>

3446
02:33:56.041 --> 02:33:59.100
<v Speaker 3>It the whole thing is the bailout should</v>
<v Speaker 3>have been for fucking everybody who lost</v>

3447
02:33:59.101 --> 02:34:00.450
<v Speaker 3>their home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For sure,</v>

3448
02:34:00.570 --> 02:34:01.320
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

3449
02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:02.153
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The bailout most certainly shouldn't </v>

3450
02:34:03.661 --> 02:34:04.494
<v Speaker 3>have gone to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that they have to pay these </v>

3451
02:34:06.451 --> 02:34:09.180
<v Speaker 3>people these bonuses because he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonuses are in their contract,</v>

3452
02:34:09.181 --> 02:34:12.390
<v Speaker 3>but that's still crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's still crazy.</v>

3453
02:34:12.391 --> 02:34:14.280
<v Speaker 3>Even if it's in the contract.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3454
02:34:14.380 --> 02:34:16.050
<v Speaker 3>the government's got to bail you guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

3455
02:34:16.051 --> 02:34:16.884
<v Speaker 3>You guys are a failed business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's banks have failed business and </v>

3456
02:34:19.300 --> 02:34:20.133
<v Speaker 3>you're still going to try to claim that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys did so well that you need a </v>

3457
02:34:23.321 --> 02:34:24.850
<v Speaker 3>bonus like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

3458
02:34:24.851 --> 02:34:27.970
<v Speaker 3>And you're going to take that taxpayer </v>
<v Speaker 3>money and apply it to your bonus.</v>

3459
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:30.460
<v Speaker 3>So all those poor people out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>working $50,000</v>

3460
02:34:30.461 --> 02:34:32.770
<v Speaker 3>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to just take a giant,</v>

3461
02:34:32.990 --> 02:34:35.080
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a good one for one of those guys?</v>

3462
02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:37.150
<v Speaker 3>What's a good one?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's a good bonus?</v>

3463
02:34:37.210 --> 02:34:38.043
<v Speaker 3>What do you think is like the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonus that one of those banker guys got </v>

3464
02:34:40.930 --> 02:34:43.150
<v Speaker 3>during the bailout?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to get 300 million,</v>

3465
02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:45.520
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it that high?</v>

3466
02:34:46.690 --> 02:34:49.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's that high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got 30 30 minutes.</v>

3467
02:34:49.511 --> 02:34:53.350
<v Speaker 3>At least that's what the JP Morgan Guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>Guy last year yet last year.</v>

3468
02:34:53.351 --> 02:34:54.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but wait a minute.</v>

3469
02:34:54.671 --> 02:34:55.930
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not in a recession though.</v>

3470
02:34:56.210 --> 02:35:00.790
<v Speaker 3>Like they were getting it at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3471
02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:02.440
<v Speaker 3>bushes term.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3472
02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:07.680
<v Speaker 3>So that was 2009 he got 16 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone got 16 million guy.</v>

3473
02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:14.260
<v Speaker 3>You got 16 million during the bailouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3474
02:35:14.350 --> 02:35:16.900
<v Speaker 3>and his worst year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got 20 million baller.</v>

3475
02:35:18.040 --> 02:35:20.650
<v Speaker 3>We think his house looks like it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably made out of cocaine.</v>

3476
02:35:20.800 --> 02:35:25.800
<v Speaker 3>It's probably like a Igloo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walks by and licks the walls.</v>

3477
02:35:28.750 --> 02:35:29.583
<v Speaker 3>Here's the real question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You give the average person 25 billion </v>

3478
02:35:31.721 --> 02:35:33.280
<v Speaker 3>bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have to work again ever.</v>

3479
02:35:34.210 --> 02:35:37.240
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's making 20 million bucks every</v>

3480
02:35:37.241 --> 02:35:39.760
<v Speaker 3>year or more probably with all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>bonuses,</v>

3481
02:35:39.761 --> 02:35:41.560
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

3482
02:35:41.650 --> 02:35:43.030
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When do you get out?</v>

3483
02:35:43.750 --> 02:35:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Like how much do you have to have in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bank before you go,</v>

3484
02:35:45.611 --> 02:35:46.444
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to fucking live frugally </v>

3485
02:35:48.610 --> 02:35:51.700
<v Speaker 3>and never work again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That God does not need to live frugally.</v>

3486
02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:53.340
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3487
02:35:53.420 --> 02:35:54.253
<v Speaker 3>and money for most folks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's the number that you'd have </v>

3488
02:35:56.411 --> 02:35:58.120
<v Speaker 3>to get to where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>check please.</v>

3489
02:35:58.810 --> 02:35:59.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the deal,</v>

3490
02:36:00.070 --> 02:36:03.190
<v Speaker 3>whatever that driving forces though to </v>
<v Speaker 3>attain that.</v>

3491
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:05.950
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't just magically go away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

3492
02:36:05.951 --> 02:36:07.360
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you get to that point and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3493
02:36:07.361 --> 02:36:08.470
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I can retire.</v>

3494
02:36:08.471 --> 02:36:10.300
<v Speaker 3>Like what are you fucking doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Retirement?</v>

3495
02:36:10.660 --> 02:36:11.493
<v Speaker 3>Look at the people who continue to work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have a thousand things you love to </v>

3496
02:36:15.131 --> 02:36:15.964
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3497
02:36:15.970 --> 02:36:18.190
<v Speaker 3>And you're good at them and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>obsessed with them.</v>

3498
02:36:18.730 --> 02:36:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Other people don't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they know is their job.</v>

3499
02:36:21.191 --> 02:36:22.024
<v Speaker 3>All they know is to work and they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have a hard time integrating when </v>

3500
02:36:25.331 --> 02:36:26.840
<v Speaker 3>they come out of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3501
02:36:26.841 --> 02:36:29.860
<v Speaker 3>you have to have something that gives </v>
<v Speaker 3>your life meaning and purpose.</v>

3502
02:36:29.890 --> 02:36:30.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

3503
02:36:31.150 --> 02:36:31.983
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard for people to take up new </v>

3504
02:36:32.771 --> 02:36:35.020
<v Speaker 3>hobbies too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really fun.</v>

3505
02:36:35.500 --> 02:36:37.960
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about learning stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting good at stuff.</v>

3506
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:39.910
<v Speaker 3>When you suck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a little,</v>

3507
02:36:40.060 --> 02:36:40.893
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a period in the beginning of </v>

3508
02:36:41.441 --> 02:36:42.580
<v Speaker 3>it's frustrating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you,</v>

3509
02:36:42.610 --> 02:36:44.860
<v Speaker 3>if you do do like anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no matter what it is,</v>

3510
02:36:44.861 --> 02:36:47.800
<v Speaker 3>especially physical stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something about getting good at things,</v>

3511
02:36:47.801 --> 02:36:48.760
<v Speaker 3>it's very rewarding.</v>

3512
02:36:48.880 --> 02:36:50.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not enough people go through that.</v>

3513
02:36:50.711 --> 02:36:53.170
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people I think try new shit out.</v>

3514
02:36:53.620 --> 02:36:56.260
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's also new pathways </v>
<v Speaker 3>that get opened in your brain.</v>

3515
02:36:56.261 --> 02:36:58.630
<v Speaker 3>The more you try something new that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>suck at.</v>

3516
02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:59.703
<v Speaker 3>And will you start off from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>beginner phase and try to like put it </v>

3517
02:37:02.681 --> 02:37:03.514
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think the little journey of the </v>

3518
02:37:06.161 --> 02:37:09.460
<v Speaker 3>beginner phase getting good or I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>we should try something new once a year.</v>

3519
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:11.950
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe more,</v>

3520
02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:12.933
<v Speaker 3>but for me it can't be more than once a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year because I get too crazy about </v>

3521
02:37:14.801 --> 02:37:15.634
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me once a year it's like I might be </v>

3522
02:37:17.181 --> 02:37:18.014
<v Speaker 3>able to squeeze something in once a year</v>
<v Speaker 3>and try it out for a little while and </v>

3523
02:37:20.031 --> 02:37:22.520
<v Speaker 3>not let it overcome all the things I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>already crazy about.</v>

3524
02:37:23.420 --> 02:37:25.280
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How often do you go hunting?</v>

3525
02:37:26.750 --> 02:37:28.310
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3526
02:37:28.400 --> 02:37:29.233
<v Speaker 3>it's usually in the fall for elk and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then usually we do something in the </v>

3527
02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:38.811
<v Speaker 3>early spring.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3528
02:37:38.811 --> 02:37:42.470
<v Speaker 3>we go to Lanai and we hunt for access </v>
<v Speaker 3>deer.</v>

3529
02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:43.963
<v Speaker 3>That's like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gets you ready for a bow hunting </v>

3530
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:49.880
<v Speaker 3>because they were really difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunt you there really fast.</v>

3531
02:37:49.920 --> 02:37:53.120
<v Speaker 3>There's one out that access is 24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven in Texas,</v>

3532
02:37:53.150 --> 02:37:53.960
<v Speaker 3>24,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seven.</v>

3533
02:37:53.960 --> 02:37:55.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can hunt them all day long,</v>

3534
02:37:55.650 --> 02:37:57.740
<v Speaker 3>but they have a real problem in the fact</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they,</v>

3535
02:37:58.370 --> 02:38:00.250
<v Speaker 3>especially in the night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have no predators.</v>

3536
02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:01.970
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least in Texas,</v>

3537
02:38:01.971 --> 02:38:06.971
<v Speaker 3>they have mountain lions and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe coyotes are a situation for Fonz.</v>

3538
02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:08.810
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think,</v>

3539
02:38:08.810 --> 02:38:10.550
<v Speaker 3>I would imagine coyote's kits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some phones,</v>

3540
02:38:10.551 --> 02:38:12.070
<v Speaker 3>but they don't really have many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3541
02:38:12.110 --> 02:38:12.943
<v Speaker 3>bear to speak of Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although I think Texas is seeing a </v>

3542
02:38:15.171 --> 02:38:16.004
<v Speaker 3>resurgence in black bear population.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're starting to see sightings of </v>

3543
02:38:18.861 --> 02:38:20.230
<v Speaker 3>black bear check Steve.</v>

3544
02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:22.310
<v Speaker 3>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3545
02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:24.440
<v Speaker 3>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3546
02:38:24.441 --> 02:38:27.120
<v Speaker 3>that would kill off some.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kill off a shit load of deer,</v>

3547
02:38:27.250 --> 02:38:29.100
<v Speaker 3>a little,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bear or um,</v>

3548
02:38:29.280 --> 02:38:31.370
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>little calves and um,</v>

3549
02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:33.260
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fonz,</v>

3550
02:38:33.290 --> 02:38:37.910
<v Speaker 3>deer fawns and cow l calves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When a cow elk rather gives a calf,</v>

3551
02:38:37.911 --> 02:38:40.460
<v Speaker 3>bears get those fuckers all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get like half of them,</v>

3552
02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:43.520
<v Speaker 3>half of the Fonz bond born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

3553
02:38:43.700 --> 02:38:44.533
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They smell it a mile away or they have </v>

3554
02:38:45.681 --> 02:38:49.890
<v Speaker 3>like insane sense of smell they can tune</v>
<v Speaker 3>into on.</v>

3555
02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:50.733
<v Speaker 3>We'll let go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When when people shoot guns and kill an </v>

3556
02:38:53.901 --> 02:38:55.190
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they think it's like,</v>

3557
02:38:55.191 --> 02:38:56.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dinner bell.</v>

3558
02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:59.660
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a real issue with that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>like certain places where people hunt or</v>

3559
02:38:59.661 --> 02:39:02.240
<v Speaker 3>this bears once,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you shoot something they go,</v>

3560
02:39:02.241 --> 02:39:03.230
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going that way.</v>

3561
02:39:03.290 --> 02:39:04.123
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to take whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shot and that'll be mine now and </v>

3562
02:39:06.411 --> 02:39:07.244
<v Speaker 3>they can smell the guts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like as soon as you start cleaning it </v>

3563
02:39:08.530 --> 02:39:09.261
<v Speaker 3>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they smell it.</v>

3564
02:39:09.261 --> 02:39:10.094
<v Speaker 3>Like way the fuck away from you might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>going home with a bear and an access </v>

3565
02:39:15.351 --> 02:39:16.071

<v Speaker 3>that'll take you from like San Luis </v>

3672
02:44:02.171 --> 02:44:03.970
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like they had these photos of before and</v>

3673
02:44:03.971 --> 02:44:05.110
<v Speaker 3>after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3674
02:44:05.111 --> 02:44:09.130
<v Speaker 3>imagine seeing that go down magic bean </v>

3686
02:44:31.780 --> 02:44:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Because there was some questions is </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they were going to dig it</v>

3687
02:44:34.811 --> 02:44:35.644
<v Speaker 3>out or what the Nigga put a new road </v>
<v Speaker 3>over the top of the dirt that's there </v>

3688
02:44:38.651 --> 02:44:41.230
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That's what a weird thing to say.</v>

3691
02:44:50.980 --> 02:44:54.880
<v Speaker 3>Residents or vibe by creating hiking </v>
<v Speaker 3>trails that enabled people to bypass the</v>

3692
02:44:54.881 --> 02:44:55.714
<v Speaker 3>highway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Closures by foot and those courageous </v>

3693
02:44:57.881 --> 02:44:58.714
<v Speaker 3>enough to drive could take on the Nassi </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nascimento first and a road with its </v>

3694
02:45:03.191 --> 02:45:05.530
<v Speaker 3>hairpin turns and shit.</v>

<v Speaker 3>connects the big Sur coast with route </v>
<v Speaker 3>one o one further inland.</v>

3697
02:45:13.541 --> 02:45:16.600
<v Speaker 3>Given the challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 3>several tourism businesses simply closed</v>

02:47:31.620 --> 02:47:32.453
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's your on the cakes and all that </v>

3755
02:47:33.711 --> 02:47:36.080
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it teaches people to point spar.</v>

3756
02:47:36.530 --> 02:47:38.230
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it wouldn't be your,</v>

3757
02:47:38.430 --> 02:47:42.260
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't your only training,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if your was your only training,</v>

3758
02:47:42.350 --> 02:47:44.270
<v Speaker 3>you know like a lot of Thai guys go </v>
<v Speaker 3>light anyway.</v>

3759
02:47:44.271 --> 02:47:47.360
<v Speaker 3>When they spar spar Thai style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're playing with each other.</v>

3760
02:47:47.510 --> 02:47:50.720
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of do that with this and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just do it fast.</v>

3761
02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:55.010
<v Speaker 3>And then as long as you did like pad </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and real sparring on top of it,</v>

3762
02:47:55.340 --> 02:47:56.173
<v Speaker 3>I bet it would add.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet it would add something just makes </v>

3763
02:47:58.971 --> 02:48:00.080
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're constantly,</v>

3764
02:48:00.081 --> 02:48:03.320
<v Speaker 3>you're constantly being reacting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there would be no consequences.</v>

3765
02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:05.300
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're not even feel it,</v>

3766
02:48:05.301 --> 02:48:06.134
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would,</v>

3767
02:48:06.490 --> 02:48:10.010
<v Speaker 3>you would constantly be reacting to </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement and he would get it to react to</v>

3768
02:48:10.011 --> 02:48:12.050
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there would be no consequences.</v>

3769
02:48:12.050 --> 02:48:14.720
<v Speaker 3>So you could do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not worry about like hurting yourself.</v>

3770
02:48:15.380 --> 02:48:17.990
<v Speaker 3>And you also wouldn't worry about like </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting hit.</v>

3771
02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:20.120
<v Speaker 3>So you'd be a little freer with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>motions.</v>

3772
02:48:20.390 --> 02:48:21.223
<v Speaker 3>I think if they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have to be another human </v>

3773
02:48:22.551 --> 02:48:25.340
<v Speaker 3>playing you though because if it's just </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking some computer,</v>

3774
02:48:25.400 --> 02:48:28.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean they got to write it in an </v>
<v Speaker 3>algorithm on how often the faint works,</v>

3775
02:48:28.941 --> 02:48:31.340
<v Speaker 3>how often it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if it didn't,</v>

3776
02:48:31.370 --> 02:48:32.990
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't scared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wouldn't give a shit.</v>

3777
02:48:32.991 --> 02:48:34.790
<v Speaker 3>It would just block everything and </v>
<v Speaker 3>destroy you.</v>

3778
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:37.970
<v Speaker 3>Well it knows where your body is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3779
02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:41.030
<v Speaker 3>Perfect distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it has to have some sort of,</v>

3780
02:48:41.090 --> 02:48:43.100
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would have a haptic fucking jumpsuit</v>

3781
02:48:43.101 --> 02:48:45.020
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd have a haptic look wetsuit.</v>

3782
02:48:45.380 --> 02:48:46.213
<v Speaker 3>I go all the way to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so if you get hit with like an </v>

3783
02:48:47.451 --> 02:48:49.250
<v Speaker 3>inside leg kick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd hear the slap,</v>

3784
02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:51.230
<v Speaker 3>you'd feel that slap on the inside of </v>
<v Speaker 3>your thigh.</v>

3785
02:48:51.230 --> 02:48:52.970
<v Speaker 3>Like Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3786
02:48:53.240 --> 02:48:55.100
<v Speaker 3>did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not perfect.</v>

3787
02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:58.850
<v Speaker 3>But I think that there'd be something </v>
<v Speaker 3>really beneficial about that.</v>

3788
02:48:59.050 --> 02:48:59.883
<v Speaker 3>Just just constantly moving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>constantly reacting to this thing in </v>

3789
02:49:03.471 --> 02:49:05.600
<v Speaker 3>front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would just put in a lot of reps that</v>

3790
02:49:05.601 --> 02:49:07.220
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gauging distance.</v>

3791
02:49:07.230 --> 02:49:09.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of reps.</v>

3792
02:49:09.870 --> 02:49:10.703
<v Speaker 3>But it'd be interesting to know like </v>
<v Speaker 3>would it no when you really hit it with </v>

3793
02:49:14.371 --> 02:49:17.860
<v Speaker 3>stuff or do we not hitting anything?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about like when,</v>

3794
02:49:17.861 --> 02:49:20.400
<v Speaker 3>when are you getting jammed?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're hitting it and when</v>

3795
02:49:20.401 --> 02:49:21.390
<v Speaker 3>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when are you two close?</v>

3796
02:49:21.450 --> 02:49:22.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like the power meter,</v>

3797
02:49:22.830 --> 02:49:23.630
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3798
02:49:23.630 --> 02:49:24.480
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

3799
02:49:24.481 --> 02:49:25.680
<v Speaker 3>You learn at the kick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It shouldn't,</v>

3800
02:49:25.710 --> 02:49:26.950
<v Speaker 3>it's not all kicks are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3801
02:49:27.180 --> 02:49:29.190
<v Speaker 3>Does it count the same just because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>make contact?</v>

3802
02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:30.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If someone,</v>

3803
02:49:30.030 --> 02:49:30.863
<v Speaker 3>if you go to throw a front kick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone's here and you get your knee up </v>

3804
02:49:33.091 --> 02:49:33.924
<v Speaker 3>high and then you push into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big difference between the guy </v>

3805
02:49:35.701 --> 02:49:39.060
<v Speaker 3>being here and you're just like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>falling backwards.</v>

3806
02:49:39.061 --> 02:49:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Like does it know which is you back </v>
<v Speaker 3>versus pushes him back.</v>

3807
02:49:42.120 --> 02:49:44.790
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's huge with sparring,</v>

3808
02:49:45.420 --> 02:49:50.370
<v Speaker 3>having a good sense of distance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how it knows that exactly where</v>

3809
02:49:50.371 --> 02:49:51.204
<v Speaker 3>your foot lands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the coolest shit that </v>

3810
02:49:52.831 --> 02:49:54.510
<v Speaker 3>I've seen with that is like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>artwork,</v>

3811
02:49:54.511 --> 02:49:55.230
<v Speaker 3>you can do</v>

3812
02:49:55.230 --> 02:49:56.110
<v Speaker 9>those worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Our game,</v>

3813
02:49:56.111 --> 02:49:57.390
<v Speaker 9>this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's not exactly,</v>

3814
02:49:57.391 --> 02:49:59.670
<v Speaker 9>this is crude of what you guys are </v>
<v Speaker 9>talking about.</v>

3815
02:49:59.671 --> 02:50:03.570
<v Speaker 9>It's called drunken fist fight.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The guy's going to grab a pool stick and</v>

3816
02:50:03.571 --> 02:50:05.010
<v Speaker 9>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That guy froze there.</v>

3817
02:50:05.040 --> 02:50:06.120
<v Speaker 9>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh whoa.</v>

3818
02:50:06.810 --> 02:50:07.643
<v Speaker 9>So the sort of reacted to him,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but like right now the vr things only </v>

3819
02:50:10.201 --> 02:50:13.110
<v Speaker 9>tracking the sensors so that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 9>have a haptic suit,</v>

3820
02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:15.570
<v Speaker 9>but it has sensors in it and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 9>think they're quite,</v>

3821
02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:17.760
<v Speaker 9>they're quite that far yet.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know what I mean?</v>

3822
02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:21.390
<v Speaker 9>That'd be a lot of sensors and right now</v>
<v Speaker 9>that things is only tracking the headset</v>

3823
02:50:21.391 --> 02:50:22.224
<v Speaker 9>and the two things you put on your hands</v>
<v Speaker 9>and you can't add more of those to like </v>

3824
02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:26.640
<v Speaker 9>maybe put it on your foot or something </v>
<v Speaker 9>like that.</v>

3825
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:27.983
<v Speaker 9>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's like just tracking it in space so </v>

3826
02:50:29.821 --> 02:50:30.750
<v Speaker 9>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 9>uh,</v>

3827
02:50:30.840 --> 02:50:34.740
<v Speaker 9>it's not tracking impact or speed or </v>
<v Speaker 9>maybe a little bit of speed.</v>

3828
02:50:35.100 --> 02:50:36.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a super crude.</v>

3829
02:50:36.390 --> 02:50:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Give it 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3830
02:50:39.700 --> 02:50:40.533
<v Speaker 9>But you need lots of sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't even even know what you would </v>

3831
02:50:42.791 --> 02:50:45.100
<v Speaker 9>need to track of an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Oh,</v>

3832
02:50:45.101 --> 02:50:48.130
<v Speaker 9>so you're in a bar and you're supposed </v>
<v Speaker 9>to be fighting these guys in a bar.</v>

3833
02:50:48.160 --> 02:50:50.650
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is just super simple,</v>

3834
02:50:50.651 --> 02:50:52.840
<v Speaker 9>but like these are just programmed,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3835
02:50:52.841 --> 02:50:53.674
<v Speaker 9>like ai bots that are just like watching</v>
<v Speaker 9>a swipe of a hand near its face and </v>

3836
02:50:57.791 --> 02:51:00.820
<v Speaker 9>they've just programmed that little like</v>
<v Speaker 9>movement is all.</v>

3837
02:51:00.930 --> 02:51:01.763
<v Speaker 9>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So you get,</v>

3838
02:51:01.990 --> 02:51:04.090
<v Speaker 9>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would say the long time away,</v>

3839
02:51:04.091 --> 02:51:04.924
<v Speaker 9>but maybe not.</v>

3840
02:51:05.070 --> 02:51:05.903
<v Speaker 3>I think the real move one day is ai </v>
<v Speaker 3>robots that know Jujitsu and go at like </v>

3841
02:51:10.381 --> 02:51:12.030
<v Speaker 3>50% speed.</v>

3842
02:51:13.410 --> 02:51:14.070
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3843
02:51:14.070 --> 02:51:16.110
<v Speaker 3>That would have to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've been watching westworld?</v>

3865
02:51:58.960 --> 02:52:02.760

<v Speaker 3>about consciousness,</v>

3866
02:52:02.761 --> 02:52:03.594
<v Speaker 3>what that is and what it can be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then where our futures that I don't </v>

3867
02:52:06.701 --> 02:52:07.990
<v Speaker 3>want to go.</v>

<v Speaker 3>out in taekwondo school was very strict </v>
<v Speaker 3>as a lot of discipline,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So the kids,</v>

3982
02:57:21.121 --> 02:57:22.800
<v Speaker 3>even though they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like dogs,</v>

3983
02:57:22.830 --> 02:57:23.980
<v Speaker 3>they're well trained.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they experience lost the experience.</v>

3987
02:57:29.191 --> 02:57:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Some form of fucking real worldliness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3988
02:57:32.771 --> 02:57:34.620
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like the shit on mic Dojo.</v>

3989
02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:35.431
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

02:59:07.420 --> 02:59:08.253
<v Speaker 5>That's just what is a little bit more </v>
<v Speaker 5>believable than the other one was the </v>

4028
02:59:10.031 --> 02:59:12.460
<v Speaker 5>one right next to it where the guys on </v>

<v Speaker 3>This one's so fucking stupid.</v>

4031
02:59:17.100 --> 02:59:17.933
<v Speaker 3>I mean</v>

4032
02:59:22.220 --> 02:59:24.230
<v Speaker 10>retained with that hand.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Reach me with that.</v>

4033
02:59:25.010 --> 02:59:27.190
<v Speaker 10>What do you see?</v>
<v Speaker 10>You cannot,</v>

4034
02:59:27.560 --> 02:59:31.340
<v Speaker 10>you can't reach me with that as this.</v>
<v Speaker 10>Reach me with that hand.</v>

02:59:31.430 --> 02:59:35.570
<v Speaker 10>Reach me with that.</v>
<v Speaker 10>You can zoom in on</v>

4036
02:59:37.630 --> 02:59:40.330
<v Speaker 5>can handlebar mustaches like straight </v>
<v Speaker 5>Ben Stiller.</v>

4037
02:59:40.540 --> 02:59:41.373
<v Speaker 5>But this is why I think I get freaked </v>
<v Speaker 5>out by cults is that when I was a young </v>

4038
02:59:44.291 --> 02:59:46.060
<v Speaker 5>teenager and I started doing martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts,</v>

4039
02:59:46.360 --> 02:59:48.640
<v Speaker 5>I saw like certain elements of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

4040
02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:49.503
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I went to Catholic school for just one </v>

4041
02:59:50.501 --> 02:59:52.970
<v Speaker 5>year when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was seven first grade,</v>

4042
02:59:53.010 --> 02:59:53.843
<v Speaker 5>actually six,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4043
02:59:54.340 --> 02:59:55.020
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

4044
02:59:55.020 --> 02:59:58.750
<v Speaker 5>it was fucking horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember thinking like that,</v>

4045
02:59:58.751 --> 03:00:01.330
<v Speaker 5>I can't believe all these people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>just doing this.</v>

4046
03:00:01.600 --> 03:00:03.130
<v Speaker 5>Like all these people were following </v>
<v Speaker 5>along the way.</v>

4047
03:00:03.131 --> 03:00:05.110
<v Speaker 5>There was like so off.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4048
03:00:05.111 --> 03:00:07.060
<v Speaker 5>Enough with the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to see anymore of these.</v>

4049
03:00:07.061 --> 03:00:09.490
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's just two other offices do.</v>

4050
03:00:09.550 --> 03:00:12.100
<v Speaker 5>But he's got hundreds of a man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But,</v>

4051
03:00:12.130 --> 03:00:14.140
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I recognize that,</v>

4052
03:00:14.170 --> 03:00:15.280
<v Speaker 5>like when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

4053
03:00:15.310 --> 03:00:17.410
<v Speaker 5>this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this doesn't make sense.</v>

4054
03:00:17.411 --> 03:00:20.140
<v Speaker 5>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's just going along with this.</v>

4055
03:00:20.140 --> 03:00:23.230
<v Speaker 5>This is normal to leave your kids with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this mean as none.</v>

4056
03:00:23.231 --> 03:00:25.810
<v Speaker 5>And all these fucking people are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's like,</v>

4057
03:00:25.811 --> 03:00:27.820
<v Speaker 5>stay in order.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everyone's nasty to you.</v>

4058
03:00:27.821 --> 03:00:29.350
<v Speaker 5>And the hidden kids like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oof.</v>

4059
03:00:29.830 --> 03:00:31.630
<v Speaker 5>It was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I remember thinking,</v>

4060
03:00:31.631 --> 03:00:32.590
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ah,</v>

4061
03:00:32.620 --> 03:00:33.453
<v Speaker 5>there's something that happens to people</v>
<v Speaker 5>when they get big groups of them </v>

4062
03:00:36.251 --> 03:00:38.580
<v Speaker 5>together and they agree on irrational </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit cause set.</v>

4063
03:00:38.581 --> 03:00:41.590
<v Speaker 5>There's some weird thing that happens to</v>
<v Speaker 5>people where everybody,</v>

4064
03:00:41.591 --> 03:00:42.424
<v Speaker 5>this can't be right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That lady is not acting in the name of </v>

4065
03:00:44.411 --> 03:00:45.640
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no fucking way.</v>

4066
03:00:45.760 --> 03:00:46.593
<v Speaker 5>She's a crazy mean old lady and I got to</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen to her because she worked for </v>

4067
03:00:49.031 --> 03:00:51.400
<v Speaker 5>God.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like this is fucking nuts.</v>

4068
03:00:51.640 --> 03:00:53.750
<v Speaker 5>Can I talk to God?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does he know how she asks?</v>

4069
03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.800
<v Speaker 5>You got to talk through her.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She has a representative.</v>

4070
03:00:56.801 --> 03:00:57.634
<v Speaker 5>I got a phone line,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your fucking parents you there and drop </v>

4071
03:01:00.041 --> 03:01:02.320
<v Speaker 5>you off and leave you with these </v>
<v Speaker 5>monsters all day and you're like,</v>

4072
03:01:02.321 --> 03:01:02.950
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

4073
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:04.960
<v Speaker 5>And some of them got fucked,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

4074
03:01:05.110 --> 03:01:07.090
<v Speaker 5>Some of them got molested.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not just some of them.</v>

4075
03:01:07.091 --> 03:01:07.924
<v Speaker 5>Quite a few.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I think I had a healthy respect for </v>

4076
03:01:12.011 --> 03:01:14.740
<v Speaker 5>that and fear of that when I was real </v>
<v Speaker 5>young.</v>

4077
03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:19.180
<v Speaker 5>And then I saw some of the same elements</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I started doing martial arts,</v>

4078
03:01:19.630 --> 03:01:21.990
<v Speaker 5>particularly with like some of the more </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous like,</v>

4079
03:01:22.810 --> 03:01:25.540
<v Speaker 5>like really rigid traditional type </v>
<v Speaker 5>styles.</v>

4080
03:01:25.541 --> 03:01:27.700
<v Speaker 5>A lot of Kung Fu.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a lot of like,</v>

4081
03:01:28.030 --> 03:01:28.863
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for every hundred martial arts schools </v>

4082
03:01:31.480 --> 03:01:34.120
<v Speaker 5>you had three or four that were just </v>
<v Speaker 5>flat out cults.</v>

4083
03:01:34.720 --> 03:01:38.190
<v Speaker 5>I just made those numbers up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have no idea what's accurate.</v>

4084
03:01:38.200 --> 03:01:40.060
<v Speaker 5>1%,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who was the guy,</v>

4085
03:01:41.020 --> 03:01:41.853

<v Speaker 5>it was in China that fucked up one of </v>

4086

<v Speaker 5>these fake oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>grand masters.</v>

4087
03:01:46.020 --> 03:01:48.540
<v Speaker 5>Then he had to go into hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well this guy,</v>

<v Speaker 5>You're dealing with someone who's </v>

4097
03:02:06.070 --> 03:02:06.903
<v Speaker 5>delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But it is fair because we all need to </v>

4098
03:02:09.131 --> 03:02:09.964
<v Speaker 5>see that because there's some people </v>
<v Speaker 5>that really did believe that guy had </v>

4099
03:02:11.801 --> 03:02:12.634
<v Speaker 5>magic powers because they run a cult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like these people that are doing all </v>

4100
03:02:15.581 --> 03:02:18.040
<v Speaker 5>this death touched it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the see their students,</v>

4101
03:02:18.041 --> 03:02:18.930
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Huh.</v>

4102
03:02:19.010 --> 03:02:19.843
<v Speaker 5>And they fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They believe that they're getting </v>

4103
03:02:21.401 --> 03:02:22.800
<v Speaker 5>jolted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And some weird might,</v>

4104
03:02:22.840 --> 03:02:23.673
<v Speaker 5>maybe not 100%,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a small percentage of their </v>

4105
03:02:25.721 --> 03:02:28.300
<v Speaker 5>bay brain that's willing to not just go </v>
<v Speaker 5>along with it,</v>

4106
03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:30.580
<v Speaker 5>but to believe this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>something special.</v>

4107
03:02:31.030 --> 03:02:33.340
<v Speaker 5>That guy with the yellow sneakers didn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>give a fuck about that.</v>

4108
03:02:33.340 --> 03:02:37.000
<v Speaker 5>He just beat the shit out of that dude </v>
<v Speaker 5>and for everybody else.</v>

4109
03:02:37.001 --> 03:02:38.290
<v Speaker 5>But that dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>

4110
03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:39.693
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for that guy to to find out that he's </v>

4111
03:02:41.171 --> 03:02:44.590
<v Speaker 5>not really some possessor of magic </v>
<v Speaker 5>powers.</v>

4112
03:02:44.860 --> 03:02:46.270
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if he really did believe it,</v>

4113
03:02:46.480 --> 03:02:47.081
<v Speaker 5>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is it.</v>

4116

<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is like maybe six or seven seconds </v>

4121
03:03:06.941 --> 03:03:08.590
<v Speaker 5>before they stop it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I've heard a hundred stories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4145
03:04:09.021 --> 03:04:09.854
<v Speaker 4>We have our,</v>

4146
03:04:11.391 --> 03:04:12.224
<v Speaker 4>drill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a lot of guys who've got really </v>

4147
03:04:13.191 --> 03:04:14.024
<v Speaker 4>good because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Jujitsu guys that want to be in </v>

4148
03:04:15.771 --> 03:04:16.604
<v Speaker 4>roommates with other Jujitsu guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of instead of just going to </v>

4149
03:04:18.681 --> 03:04:19.514
<v Speaker 4>class everyday enrolling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would take like one or two days a </v>

4150
03:04:21.711 --> 03:04:25.100
<v Speaker 4>week and they would do like a straight </v>
<v Speaker 4>hour of nothing but drills and like,</v>

4151
03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.943
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd be amazed at how much better you </v>

4152
03:04:26.421 --> 03:04:29.090
<v Speaker 4>get just from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>

4153
03:04:29.190 --> 03:04:31.410
<v Speaker 4>Those guys don't give a fuck about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of what I do with,</v>

4154
03:04:32.130 --> 03:04:32.963
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just get on the mat like I don't have </v>

4155
03:04:34.851 --> 03:04:38.090
<v Speaker 4>the time now to go to a full yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'll just hit it.</v>

4156
03:04:38.090 --> 03:04:40.040
<v Speaker 4>Then I hear there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it'll drop down.</v>

4157
03:04:40.130 --> 03:04:40.963
<v Speaker 4>My wife's yoga certified now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so she'll put me through some shit and </v>

4158
03:04:42.951 --> 03:04:44.600
<v Speaker 4>we could just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's very nice.</v>

4159
03:04:44.660 --> 03:04:45.760
<v Speaker 4>That's very nice to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you,</v>

4160
03:04:45.790 --> 03:04:48.350
<v Speaker 4>do you ever do it outside in the grass </v>
<v Speaker 4>yoga,</v>

4161
03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:52.480
<v Speaker 4>rolling yoga and yoga outside in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>grass lifestyle outdoors,</v>

4162
03:04:52.790 --> 03:04:55.910
<v Speaker 4>I think it is to like anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know for sure.</v>

4163
03:04:55.911 --> 03:04:59.210
<v Speaker 4>I was doing it on the Cathedral Rock,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the LSD and the cat cow.</v>

4164
03:04:59.810 --> 03:05:02.510
<v Speaker 4>That's a double dose on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that candy flipping or what?</v>

4165
03:05:02.540 --> 03:05:03.950
<v Speaker 4>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's kind of candy.</v>

4166
03:05:03.980 --> 03:05:05.150
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of cow flip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4167
03:05:05.260 --> 03:05:06.310
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that where candy flip?</v>

4168
03:05:06.311 --> 03:05:09.260
<v Speaker 4>It came from chocolate tea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to think.</v>

4169
03:05:09.261 --> 03:05:11.330
<v Speaker 4>Cook has been around a little longer </v>
<v Speaker 4>than LSD.</v>

4170
03:05:11.650 --> 03:05:13.820
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the original candy flip must've been</v>

4171
03:05:13.821 --> 03:05:16.460
<v Speaker 4>Mtma with LSD.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Probably put,</v>

4172
03:05:16.461 --> 03:05:18.380
<v Speaker 4>maybe it was candy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it was good cow.</v>

4173
03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:20.810
<v Speaker 4>Fucking chocolate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little lsd.</v>

<v Speaker 4>far as interesting substance stinks?</v>

4176
03:05:29.290 --> 03:05:31.250

<v Speaker 4>a trip.</v>

4210
03:06:57.461 --> 03:06:58.294
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you always have the stuff at your </v>

4211
03:06:58.531 --> 03:07:01.020
<v Speaker 4>fingertips.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why wouldn't you do a podcast?</v>

4212
03:07:01.021 --> 03:07:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't even make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It all makes sense now.</v>

4213
03:07:03.060 --> 03:07:03.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

4214
03:07:03.570 --> 03:07:04.181
<v Speaker 4>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4215
03:07:04.181 --> 03:07:06.660
<v Speaker 4>It's like being like really good at </v>
<v Speaker 4>playing guitar and someone says like,</v>

4216
03:07:06.661 --> 03:07:07.494
<v Speaker 4>you man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he should probably be in a band or </v>

4217
03:07:08.191 --> 03:07:09.540
<v Speaker 4>something and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck that.</v>

4218
03:07:09.730 --> 03:07:10.351
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4219
03:07:10.351 --> 03:07:12.330
<v Speaker 4>It sounds hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem like something I'm going</v>

4220
03:07:12.331 --> 03:07:14.130
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really into music.</v>

4221
03:07:14.310 --> 03:07:16.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Music.</v>

4222
03:07:17.130 --> 03:07:17.760
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got,</v>

4223
03:07:17.760 --> 03:07:18.593
<v Speaker 4>we've got the podcast and that's a big </v>
<v Speaker 4>child of mine at on it and then talked </v>

4224
03:07:21.570 --> 03:07:23.940
<v Speaker 4>development would probably be the other </v>
<v Speaker 4>big piece of that.</v>

4225
03:07:24.130 --> 03:07:25.380
<v Speaker 4>Let me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me in on this.</v>

4226
03:07:25.560 --> 03:07:27.510
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck do you make those protein </v>
<v Speaker 4>bites?</v>

4227
03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:30.120
<v Speaker 4>This sounds like a commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but those protein bites are,</v>

4228
03:07:30.170 --> 03:07:31.520
<v Speaker 4>there was a crack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4229
03:07:31.530 --> 03:07:32.363
<v Speaker 4>something in those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've sent them to people and my friend </v>

4230
03:07:34.051 --> 03:07:34.801
<v Speaker 4>Aaron Snyder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>

4231
03:07:34.801 --> 03:07:35.730
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this shit's heroin.</v>

4232
03:07:35.880 --> 03:07:39.930
<v Speaker 4>Like what's in this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't stop making them into one,</v>

4233
03:07:39.931 --> 03:07:41.550
<v Speaker 4>so it's actually a bite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were like,</v>

4234
03:07:41.580 --> 03:07:43.470
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people eat both.</v>

4235
03:07:43.500 --> 03:07:45.690
<v Speaker 4>Or if they do eat one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll hand the other one off.</v>

4236
03:07:45.720 --> 03:07:46.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you give one to a friend,</v>

4237
03:07:46.771 --> 03:07:48.450
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4238
03:07:48.750 --> 03:07:49.583
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got four new flavors coming out </v>

4239
03:07:50.640 --> 03:07:52.860
<v Speaker 4>and we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get to be the Guinea pig for that shit</v>

4240
03:07:52.861 --> 03:07:54.630
<v Speaker 4>too with Aubrey and a few other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the team.</v>

4241
03:07:54.631 --> 03:07:57.900
<v Speaker 4>Etg Lindsey tastes so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4242
03:07:58.740 --> 03:08:00.720
<v Speaker 4>And they don't make you feel bad at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4243
03:08:00.780 --> 03:08:01.613
<v Speaker 4>I have to eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new flavors are going to be fucking </v>

4244
03:08:02.701 --> 03:08:04.890
<v Speaker 4>top tier two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about like,</v>

4245
03:08:05.010 --> 03:08:07.830
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm willing to get like a,</v>

4246
03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.740
<v Speaker 4>a slightly adverse reaction if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>hungry,</v>

4247
03:08:11.310 --> 03:08:16.020
<v Speaker 4>if I'm hungry and I want like a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>type of sugar free protein bar,</v>

4248
03:08:16.021 --> 03:08:17.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll just fucking eat it.</v>

4249
03:08:17.180 --> 03:08:18.930
<v Speaker 4>I need something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll eat it.</v>

4250
03:08:18.931 --> 03:08:19.980
<v Speaker 4>But while I'm eating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

4251
03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:21.570
<v Speaker 4>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on here?</v>

4252
03:08:21.660 --> 03:08:23.820
<v Speaker 4>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know your body's going,</v>

4253
03:08:23.821 --> 03:08:24.511
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4254
03:08:24.511 --> 03:08:25.344
<v Speaker 4>this is a little weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like whatever the protein in this is a </v>

4255
03:08:27.481 --> 03:08:29.910
<v Speaker 4>little hard for me to digest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's a fart for you motherfucker.</v>

4256
03:08:31.290 --> 03:08:35.100
<v Speaker 4>But hopefully we'll probably flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But with those protein bites,</v>

4257
03:08:35.101 --> 03:08:36.780
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't feel like you did anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrong.</v>

4258
03:08:37.020 --> 03:08:38.760
<v Speaker 4>Was the problem healthy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They taste good,</v>

4259
03:08:38.761 --> 03:08:40.350
<v Speaker 4>but they don't feel like you did </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything wrong.</v>

4260
03:08:40.590 --> 03:08:41.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you could eat.</v>

4261
03:08:41.490 --> 03:08:45.150
<v Speaker 4>That's the four of them to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>something healthy that tastes delicious.</v>

4262
03:08:45.240 --> 03:08:47.310
<v Speaker 4>I eat for them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4263
03:08:47.311 --> 03:08:49.110
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got the thumbs up.</v>

4264
03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:51.210
<v Speaker 4>Normally I'm not allowed to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

4265
03:08:51.211 --> 03:08:52.250
<v Speaker 4>We're not creating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'll,</v>

4266
03:08:52.251 --> 03:08:53.084
<v Speaker 4>I'll just give you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to fucking make really </v>

4267
03:08:55.111 --> 03:08:58.080
<v Speaker 4>delicious healthy cereal cereal.</v>

4268
03:08:58.170 --> 03:08:59.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like cocoa pops.</v>

4269
03:09:00.540 --> 03:09:02.340
<v Speaker 4>You fucking name it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

4270
03:09:02.460 --> 03:09:03.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How are we gonna be able to do that?</v>

4271
03:09:04.530 --> 03:09:07.170
<v Speaker 4>Well I can't give away the secrets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just saying son,</v>

4272
03:09:07.250 --> 03:09:08.850
<v Speaker 4>they were going to have some fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's Lillian.</v>

4273
03:09:08.880 --> 03:09:12.240
<v Speaker 4>Is Milk healthy cause I handle </v>
<v Speaker 4>contradicting.</v>

4274
03:09:12.420 --> 03:09:14.130
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for a lot of people,</v>

4275
03:09:14.131 --> 03:09:14.964
<v Speaker 4>it's not in California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys can get raw milk that's </v>

4276
03:09:16.591 --> 03:09:18.660
<v Speaker 4>healthier snacks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Healthier is,</v>

4277
03:09:18.670 --> 03:09:19.503
<v Speaker 4>is raw milk healthy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's healthier than the killed </v>

4278
03:09:22.261 --> 03:09:23.760
<v Speaker 4>off chef Lee health where they killed </v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

4279
03:09:23.761 --> 03:09:26.160
<v Speaker 4>get rid of all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the good bacteria that's in it.</v>

4280
03:09:26.310 --> 03:09:27.450
<v Speaker 4>100%.</v>
<v Speaker 4>100%,</v>

4281
03:09:27.451 --> 03:09:28.284
<v Speaker 4>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then raw goat's milk is supposed to </v>

4282
03:09:29.911 --> 03:09:32.010
<v Speaker 4>be even better for you than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

4283
03:09:32.011 --> 03:09:34.050
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reason that we find out now that,</v>

4284
03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:34.913
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you ever read the plant paradox by </v>

4285
03:09:35.671 --> 03:09:37.020
<v Speaker 4>Doctor Steven gundry?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4286
03:09:37.080 --> 03:09:37.913
<v Speaker 4>He's just fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you bring this up on the first </v>

4287
03:09:39.421 --> 03:09:40.111
<v Speaker 4>podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did.</v>

4288
03:09:40.111 --> 03:09:42.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I had read that on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>first podcast.</v>

4289
03:09:42.930 --> 03:09:44.670
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>greenfield turned me onto this guy.</v>

4290
03:09:45.560 --> 03:09:46.393
<v Speaker 4>He says that there's a different type of</v>
<v Speaker 4>casein protein that Holstein black and </v>

4291
03:09:50.911 --> 03:09:53.160
<v Speaker 4>white dairy cows make versus southern </v>
<v Speaker 4>European</v>

4292
03:09:53.980 --> 03:09:54.970
<v Speaker 2>goats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't make it cheap.</v>

4293
03:09:54.971 --> 03:09:56.770
<v Speaker 2>Don't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to have dairy,</v>

4294
03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:01.900
<v Speaker 2>go with something from a southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>European cow or go with like goat's milk</v>

4295
03:10:01.901 --> 03:10:04.150
<v Speaker 2>cheese,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sheep's milk cheese,</v>

4296
03:10:04.151 --> 03:10:05.140
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

4297
03:10:05.141 --> 03:10:06.880
<v Speaker 2>if you're eating the fucking serial like</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing,</v>

4298
03:10:06.910 --> 03:10:10.150
<v Speaker 2>especially when I'm doing Kido,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll throw heavy,</v>

4299
03:10:10.151 --> 03:10:13.060
<v Speaker 2>heavy a coconut cream in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canned coconut cream.</v>

4300
03:10:13.090 --> 03:10:15.850
<v Speaker 2>We're making our own Kido ice cream with</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ice cream maker.</v>

4301
03:10:15.851 --> 03:10:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I do the same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

4302
03:10:17.590 --> 03:10:18.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phenomenal stuff.</v>

4303
03:10:18.881 --> 03:10:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I'll let my son mow that down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want dinner,</v>

4304
03:10:21.371 --> 03:10:22.840
<v Speaker 2>you just want ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

4305
03:10:23.350 --> 03:10:26.410
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fucking egg yolks in there.</v>

4306
03:10:26.411 --> 03:10:27.720
<v Speaker 2>If there's no fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4307
03:10:27.730 --> 03:10:29.290
<v Speaker 2>it's all natural sweeteners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No car,</v>

4308
03:10:29.350 --> 03:10:30.183
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4309
03:10:30.340 --> 03:10:32.260
<v Speaker 2>nothing's going to fuck with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>glycaemic index.</v>

4310
03:10:32.500 --> 03:10:34.250
<v Speaker 2>People don't think that that will be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4311
03:10:34.920 --> 03:10:35.753
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

4312
03:10:35.950 --> 03:10:37.690
<v Speaker 2>everyone thinks you have to suffer </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat,</v>

4313
03:10:38.170 --> 03:10:39.003
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4314
03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:42.790
<v Speaker 2>But if they could figure out to make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to make something tastes like a real</v>

4315
03:10:42.791 --> 03:10:45.160
<v Speaker 2>ice cream Sundae,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like with whipped cream,</v>

4316
03:10:45.280 --> 03:10:47.050
<v Speaker 2>hot chocolate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cherries,</v>

4317
03:10:47.051 --> 03:10:48.850
<v Speaker 2>everything and have it be super healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

4318
03:10:49.120 --> 03:10:51.250
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lily's chocolate bars,</v>

4319
03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:52.113
<v Speaker 2>no affiliation with those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've fucking figured out how to </v>

4320
03:10:54.611 --> 03:10:56.890
<v Speaker 2>make chocolate delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they deal with Stevia.</v>

4321
03:10:56.920 --> 03:10:59.020
<v Speaker 2>They do it with Stevia and a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things.</v>

4322
03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:01.420
<v Speaker 2>What is it called again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lilly's L,</v>

4323
03:11:01.421 --> 03:11:02.051
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>l,</v>

4324
03:11:02.051 --> 03:11:03.180
<v Speaker 2>l,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y or I mean,</v>

4325
03:11:03.220 --> 03:11:04.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're at whole foods,</v>

4326
03:11:04.601 --> 03:11:05.830
<v Speaker 2>sprouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those places.</v>

4327
03:11:06.190 --> 03:11:07.680
<v Speaker 2>They are fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

4328
03:11:07.681 --> 03:11:09.700
<v Speaker 2>they're really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're really insane.</v>

4329
03:11:10.510 --> 03:11:12.070
<v Speaker 2>They've got it dialed in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean you,</v>

4330
03:11:12.071 --> 03:11:14.770
<v Speaker 2>if you could melt that down on some </v>
<v Speaker 2>homemade ice cream.</v>

4331
03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:17.193
<v Speaker 2>That's something that I tell people a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot is if you're going to cheat or if </v>

4332
03:11:20.561 --> 03:11:23.350
<v Speaker 2>you're going to eat for mouth pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it yourself.</v>

4333
03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:24.273
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't make your own fucking pizza </v>

4334
03:11:25.301 --> 03:11:28.440
<v Speaker 2>with a better crust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make your own dessert with,</v>

4335
03:11:28.441 --> 03:11:31.000
<v Speaker 2>with shit that's not going to spike your</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood sugar and make you fat,</v>

4336
03:11:31.040 --> 03:11:32.770
<v Speaker 2>cause inflammation and fuck your brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

4337
03:11:32.800 --> 03:11:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Like just make it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go the extra fucking mile.</v>

4338
03:11:35.710 --> 03:11:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Do it yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be way healthier.</v>

4339
03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:41.050
<v Speaker 2>I'd be able to have time for that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4340
03:11:41.110 --> 03:11:42.940
<v Speaker 2>you have time to make your own Kido </v>
<v Speaker 2>waffles.</v>

4341
03:11:43.620 --> 03:11:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4342
03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:45.953
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that.</v>

4343
03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I don't like those waffles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched your,</v>

4344
03:11:50.950 --> 03:11:53.380
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about them and I saw it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they did a repost.</v>

4345
03:11:54.010 --> 03:11:55.840
<v Speaker 2>Haven't tried their waffles or their </v>
<v Speaker 2>syrup,</v>

4346
03:11:55.841 --> 03:11:58.360
<v Speaker 2>but I'm down to try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just haven't found the syrup anywhere.</v>

4347
03:11:58.510 --> 03:11:59.131
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4348
03:11:59.131 --> 03:11:59.964
<v Speaker 2>you get it from their website and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up some of their waffles with </v>

4349
03:12:02.801 --> 03:12:05.170
<v Speaker 2>some syrup and just a pound of butter on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4350
03:12:05.500 --> 03:12:07.540
<v Speaker 2>It was a sensational,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sounds like a good idea.</v>

4351
03:12:07.541 --> 03:12:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I didn't feel bad after it was over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt good.</v>

4352
03:12:10.390 --> 03:12:11.740
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even feel terrible.</v>

4353
03:12:11.770 --> 03:12:13.300
<v Speaker 2>That's the goal of creating shit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

4354
03:12:13.301 --> 03:12:14.134
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got a ton of Quito shakes now at </v>

4355
03:12:15.191 --> 03:12:18.130
<v Speaker 2>the anet cafe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will fucking change your life.</v>

4356
03:12:18.131 --> 03:12:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're insanely good changing.</v>

4357
03:12:20.560 --> 03:12:21.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>

4358
03:12:21.970 --> 03:12:23.950
<v Speaker 2>And they don't make you feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the key.</v>

4359
03:12:23.951 --> 03:12:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if there aren't some,</v>

4360
03:12:25.420 --> 03:12:27.220
<v Speaker 2>like I'll tell you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plug here,</v>

4361
03:12:27.450 --> 03:12:29.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these fucking kill cliffs.</v>

4362
03:12:29.500 --> 03:12:30.333
<v Speaker 2>These are God damn delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any business affiliation </v>

4363
03:12:32.771 --> 03:12:34.110
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

4364
03:12:34.330 --> 03:12:36.640
<v Speaker 2>How much sugar does this thing having it</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>

4365
03:12:36.641 --> 03:12:41.230
<v Speaker 2>It's just a zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero sugar should taste good,</v>

4366
03:12:41.470 --> 03:12:43.810
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have any bullshit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4367
03:12:43.811 --> 03:12:44.644
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this doesn't have any aspartame or </v>

4368
03:12:45.401 --> 03:12:46.870
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are they using it for?</v>

4369
03:12:46.871 --> 03:12:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they using this to,</v>

4370
03:12:49.480 --> 03:12:51.380
<v Speaker 2>to sweeten it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It Tall?</v>

4371
03:12:51.470 --> 03:12:52.130
<v Speaker 2>What does that,</v>

4372
03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:55.190
<v Speaker 4>it's a natural sweetener that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>low-glycemic similar to Stevia.</v>

4373
03:12:56.330 --> 03:12:57.680
<v Speaker 4>Xylitol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>similar to Stevia,</v>

4374
03:12:57.710 --> 03:12:59.390
<v Speaker 4>but they all have different flavor </v>
<v Speaker 4>components.</v>

4375
03:12:59.391 --> 03:13:01.940
<v Speaker 4>So some of them work better for an </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy drink.</v>

4376
03:13:01.941 --> 03:13:04.460
<v Speaker 4>Some of them work better for ice cream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit like that.</v>

4377
03:13:04.610 --> 03:13:07.460
<v Speaker 4>This is recovery and hydration.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what it is,</v>

4378
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:11.390
<v Speaker 4>this shit tastes fantastic and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no bad feeling afterwards.</v>

4379
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:13.490
<v Speaker 4>Like if I drank that and that was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>coke,</v>

4380
03:13:13.700 --> 03:13:17.400
<v Speaker 4>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh so good going down a cold coke in the</v>

4381
03:13:17.401 --> 03:13:20.510
<v Speaker 4>aluminum can you crack the top and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>got the fucking,</v>

4382
03:13:20.511 --> 03:13:23.750
<v Speaker 4>the condensation all over the top of it </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause it's so cold.</v>

4383
03:13:23.840 --> 03:13:27.980
<v Speaker 4>I haven't had a coke and hold it out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the cooler and years drawing way.</v>

4384
03:13:28.220 --> 03:13:30.110
<v Speaker 4>Especially if you have some barbecue </v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

4385
03:13:30.111 --> 03:13:30.944
<v Speaker 4>you're in the middle of the slab of ribs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you'd go for that cold coke and you </v>

4386
03:13:34.061 --> 03:13:34.751
<v Speaker 4>just chug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chug,</v>

4387
03:13:34.751 --> 03:13:35.440
<v Speaker 4>chug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>chug.</v>

4388
03:13:35.440 --> 03:13:40.440
<v Speaker 4>You'll feel the Sara Nay outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You feel that the thick syrup mega,</v>

4389
03:13:41.001 --> 03:13:44.810
<v Speaker 4>it's weighty weightier vein law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but for that mouth pleasure you'll trade</v>

4390
03:13:44.811 --> 03:13:45.644
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you like the CSEA mother fucking </v>

<v Speaker 4>It doesn't,</v>

4392
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:52.580
<v Speaker 4>it's not the same flavor that coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fucking love it though.</v>

4393
03:13:52.581 --> 03:13:54.080
<v Speaker 4>There were be ones,</v>
