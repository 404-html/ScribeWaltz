00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Hey everybody,</v>

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:04.431
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

3
00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:07.250
<v Speaker 1>if you're tuning in to this and you're expecting a regular podcast,</v>

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely not a regular podcast.</v>

5
00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>This is a podcast.</v>

6
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 1>What we sit down and watch the UFC fights and just sort of talk shit while the</v>

7
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>fights are going on.</v>

8
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Don't even expect commentary.</v>

9
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Don't expect that either.</v>

10
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.043
<v Speaker 1>Don't expect,</v>

11
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>don't expect anything and hopefully you won't have your expectations shattered.</v>

12
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.600
<v Speaker 1>But with me here is uncle creepy in McCall,</v>

13
00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>one of the top flyweights on the planet earth.</v>

14
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.360
<v Speaker 1>And my brother Jimmy Smith,</v>

15
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the best analysts slash MMA commentators slash Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black</v>

16
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:41.741
<v Speaker 1>belt slash a commentator for Bellator until they changed the name Bella tour.</v>

17
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And it should be like for now,</v>

18
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>for now,</v>

19
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>still belts for like maybe MMA.</v>

20
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>And what we're going to do is we're just going to a talk while the will,</v>

21
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:49.401
<v Speaker 1>the fights are going on,</v>

22
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:53.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a UFC fight night that's happening right now live from San Antonio.</v>

23
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.183
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

24
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 1>we'll let you know.</v>

25
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to sync up because there's a little bit of a delay between the</v>

26
00:01:00.291 --> 00:01:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Internet and what's on television.</v>

27
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like a 15 second delay.</v>

28
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 1>So what we'll do is we'll just give you like,</v>

29
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>fight starts now with us.</v>

30
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll know when to sync up with the very first fight.</v>

31
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.033
<v Speaker 1>So until then,</v>

32
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Speaker 1>it'll be kind of a cluster fuck.</v>

33
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.880
<v Speaker 1>But the card is pretty fucking dope.</v>

34
00:01:16.881 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited about cub Swanson and Jeremy Stevens.</v>

35
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>That's a good fucking fight.</v>

36
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not excited about this man.</v>

37
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>He's been dogging this since we got in here.</v>

38
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>You're friends with both of them and someone's getting their ass kicked at night</v>

39
00:01:27.411 --> 00:01:27.831
<v Speaker 1>and then like,</v>

40
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

41
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm friends with both of them too.</v>

42
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>I like both guys tremendously.</v>

43
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I liked them as fighters.</v>

44
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I liked them as people,</v>

45
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>but damn,</v>

46
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:35.384
<v Speaker 1>I want to see them fight.</v>

47
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be exciting.</v>

48
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.323
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

49
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:38.233
<v Speaker 1>No doubt about it.</v>

50
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Impossible to not be right.</v>

51
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

52
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.211
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

53
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:41.901

54
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:42.110

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>who Miss Weight again?</v>

58
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting a Nico Moose Skokie.</v>

59
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.511
<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

60
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Soki how'd he say it was?</v>

61
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Soki whatever you say it.</v>

62
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>The dude's Badass.</v>

63
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I've seen him fight.</v>

64
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:55.064
<v Speaker 1>He's excellent.</v>

65
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.641
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

66
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>very good fighter.</v>

67
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.591
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

69
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>fights out of Sweden.</v>

71
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>He's a one of those dudes that trains with Gustafson I believe.</v>

72
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.143
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

73
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>he's a very talented,</v>

74
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>very talented and very complete all round game.</v>

75
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.421
<v Speaker 1>So that's the,</v>

76
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>that's the Co main event and a lot of good fights on the undercard as well.</v>

77
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.993
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>

78
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>it's live right now from San Antonio,</v>

79
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:21.284
<v Speaker 1>Texas.</v>

80
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Who else is on there?</v>

81
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.651
<v Speaker 2>Card here.</v>

82
00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to see Diaz versus llamas.</v>

83
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.031
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

84
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:27.451
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

85
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Ricardo Lamas is on this card,</v>

86
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:29.131
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

87
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:29.821
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

88
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 2>He's fighting Huck Ron Diaz.</v>

89
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 2>He fought an m one.</v>

90
00:02:32.371 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>A covered a few of his fights.</v>

91
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>

92
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

93
00:02:34.411 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 2>he's Novan y'all great Jujitsu,</v>

94
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 2>the nine submissions,</v>

95
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 2>nine and his career.</v>

96
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 2>But he's exactly the kind of guy you want.</v>

97
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 2>If you're Ricardo lumps this camp because he's dangerous.</v>

98
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 2>He's not that well rounded.</v>

99
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 2>There's not a lot of x factor to his game.</v>

100
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.161
<v Speaker 2>You want llamas,</v>

101
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.070
<v Speaker 2>mentally ready to get back in there.</v>

103
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 2>I thought he had a good fight for the title,</v>

104
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 2>but you want,</v>

105
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 2>you got back on the horse pretty quick and Diaz is the right guy for that.</v>

106
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:02:56.231 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 1>What did you think of that fight?</v>

108
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 1>Lomis and uh,</v>

109
00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.733
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

110
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.040
<v Speaker 3>although I think all those,</v>

111
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.883
<v Speaker 3>just on another level,</v>

112
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.351
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

113
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:02.801
<v Speaker 3>all those,</v>

114
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 3>just for the first two rounds,</v>

115
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 3>he's the baddest motherfucker on earth for the first two rounds.</v>

116
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 3>Do you think it's lazy or do you think you just can't keep,</v>

117
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 3>keep that weight cut?</v>

118
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.960
<v Speaker 3>That weight cuts brutal.</v>

119
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 3>The dude walks around in one,</v>

120
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:12.754
<v Speaker 3>seven days.</v>

121
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.720
<v Speaker 3>Like I saw a member zeal and Andy plus he just looks like a Predator walking.</v>

122
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.641
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

123
00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:18.290
<v Speaker 2>that guy's book.</v>

124
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.850
<v Speaker 2>What's strange about the Lama side if you look at it,</v>

125
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.360
<v Speaker 2>is that that was a fight where you paste himself pretty well.</v>

126
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.223
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

127
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.040
<v Speaker 2>he didn't look like he was expanding a ton of energy in the first rounds like it</v>

128
00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:29.690
<v Speaker 2>usually does.</v>

129
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.911
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

130
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 2>And yet he still didn't have gas in the first fifth round.</v>

131
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.460
<v Speaker 2>So I think it is the weight cut where it's just he only has so many minutes,</v>

132
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:37.530
<v Speaker 2>the clock starts no matter what he does.</v>

133
00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Cause he didn't do a lot of wild stuff in the beginning and he's still renting a</v>

134
00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:41.220
<v Speaker 2>gas in the fifth round.</v>

135
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when he fought?</v>

136
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Not In Toronto.</v>

137
00:03:43.581 --> 00:03:47.240
<v Speaker 3>And they had that enormous car and they had all the fighters up on the deck and</v>

138
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:49.490
<v Speaker 3>everybody said he was the one who we fight fought hom nick,</v>

139
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.560
<v Speaker 3>he was gonna pass out a so sick.</v>

140
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.630
<v Speaker 3>He was so sick that he couldn't,</v>

141
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:54.710
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't just sit there,</v>

142
00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.020
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't sit that they had to take him off the desk and they had to bring</v>

143
00:03:57.021 --> 00:03:57.854
<v Speaker 3>them downstairs.</v>

144
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.020
<v Speaker 3>And this is before he weighed in,</v>

145
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

146
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.051
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was really,</v>

147
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:04.100
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous to ask a fighter before they weigh in and put a fucking suit on</v>

148
00:04:04.101 --> 00:04:07.310
<v Speaker 3>and strap your belt on and pretend that everything's fine when meanwhile you're</v>

149
00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:08.240
<v Speaker 3>on death's door,</v>

150
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

151
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.340
<v Speaker 3>how much do you cut when you cut weight?</v>

152
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.080
<v Speaker 3>I was one 40 after practice this morning and Ian Fights at 125 pounds,</v>

153
00:04:15.081 --> 00:04:17.180
<v Speaker 3>one of the top hundred 25 pounders on the planet.</v>

154
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.691
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

155
00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 3>he knows what the fuck he's talking about.</v>

156
00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 3>So one 40 for you and when you get down like the week of the fight,</v>

157
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.350
<v Speaker 3>woody tried away.</v>

158
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.520
<v Speaker 3>I try to walk around under one 41 39 is okay with you.</v>

159
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be one 35,</v>

160
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.480
<v Speaker 3>but that's probably not going to happen.</v>

161
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.590
<v Speaker 3>And we need the lighter I get,</v>

162
00:04:33.591 --> 00:04:34.424
<v Speaker 3>the better I fight.</v>

163
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.030
<v Speaker 3>It seems.</v>

164
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.520
<v Speaker 3>Do you drink a shitload of water the week of,</v>

165
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.010
<v Speaker 3>to get your body used to just pumping it out of your system?</v>

166
00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Is that the idea of mining distilled?</v>

167
00:04:42.111 --> 00:04:42.291
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

168
00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:45.530
<v Speaker 3>it took us a few days to find distilled water in Brazil,</v>

169
00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:46.364
<v Speaker 3>but we did it.</v>

170
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.791
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

171
00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:47.960
<v Speaker 3>You have to find distilled water,</v>

172
00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:48.201
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

173
00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:48.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

174
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.160
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>

175
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.971
<v Speaker 3>No minerals in it.</v>

176
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:50.391
<v Speaker 3>The minerals,</v>

177
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:53.390
<v Speaker 3>retaining water strips your body of all the salts and stuff and minerals.</v>

178
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.751
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

179
00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

180
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 3>but most people don't do this.</v>

181
00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.050
<v Speaker 3>You have to replenish the body.</v>

182
00:04:57.051 --> 00:04:57.884
<v Speaker 3>But those minerals,</v>

183
00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.993
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

184
00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Like if you get that company,</v>

185
00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:01.340
<v Speaker 3>that company called called trace minerals,</v>

186
00:05:01.341 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 3>that makes trace minerals.</v>

187
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.310
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

188
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.143
<v Speaker 3>I put them in my,</v>

189
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.700
<v Speaker 3>my water before I go to bed every night.</v>

190
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Every night while you're trained.</v>

191
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

192
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:10.700
<v Speaker 3>That's a huge thing.</v>

193
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:11.511
<v Speaker 3>Just for your health.</v>

194
00:05:11.511 --> 00:05:12.380
<v Speaker 3>People don't understand.</v>

195
00:05:12.381 --> 00:05:13.670
<v Speaker 3>And my girlfriend,</v>

196
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.031
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

197
00:05:14.031 --> 00:05:14.864
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

198
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.400
<v Speaker 3>just learned out the hard way.</v>

199
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.700
<v Speaker 3>So she learned out the hard way or she learned the hard way.</v>

200
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.451
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

201
00:05:20.451 --> 00:05:21.290
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

202
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:24.620
<v Speaker 3>she works out so hard as yoga hot yoga like every day,</v>

203
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.603
<v Speaker 3>twice a day.</v>

204
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.553
<v Speaker 3>She's kind of crazy.</v>

205
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.811
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

206
00:05:26.811 --> 00:05:27.500
<v Speaker 3>She's listening.</v>

207
00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.260
<v Speaker 3>I love you crazy in a good way.</v>

208
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.133
<v Speaker 3>It's a very nice,</v>

209
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.571
<v Speaker 3>she's cool.</v>

210
00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:33.404
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

211
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:34.250
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

212
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.083
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

213
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 3>I bought,</v>

214
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.250
<v Speaker 3>I bought her the drops because I know what she's doing.</v>

215
00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.881
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

216
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 3>I give her all kinds of stuff,</v>

217
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

218
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.890
<v Speaker 3>She does take her vitamins,</v>

219
00:05:39.891 --> 00:05:42.010
<v Speaker 3>but she just does,</v>

220
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 3>is hardheaded and doesn't listen to it.</v>

221
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 3>But now she,</v>

222
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.220
<v Speaker 3>she figured out she needs to take that stuff.</v>

223
00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.341
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

224
00:05:46.341 --> 00:05:47.300
<v Speaker 3>what made her figure it out?</v>

225
00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:48.230
<v Speaker 3>You said she got sick.</v>

226
00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.741
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

227
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:49.061
<v Speaker 3>she just,</v>

228
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:49.251
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>

229
00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 3>just wasn't feeling good,</v>

230
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

231
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.040
<v Speaker 3>during a practice.</v>

232
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.600
<v Speaker 3>And you think it's because of minerals?</v>

233
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

234
00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:54.421
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

235
00:05:54.421 --> 00:05:56.910
<v Speaker 3>she sweats out that much and does not drink it.</v>

236
00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't ever try and retain</v>

237
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

238
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.401
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

239
00:05:58.401 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing that they were saying.</v>

240
00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 4>Like they had a thing.</v>

241
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:00.561
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

242
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:01.111
<v Speaker 4>first fight.</v>

243
00:06:01.111 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 4>He's going to go on right now.</v>

244
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 4>It's Joe Ellenberger versus James Moon.</v>

245
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.923
<v Speaker 4>Moon,</v>

246
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 4>Moon task three.</v>

247
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.821
<v Speaker 4>Shit,</v>

248
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 4>we probably should have listened outset then task three.</v>

249
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 4>Let's go with one toss free.</v>

250
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:13.110
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

251
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

252
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 4>I never seen this gel and fight in the UFC before.</v>

253
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 4>It must be a one of his,</v>

254
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

255
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.720
<v Speaker 4>first fight.</v>

256
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.603
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't,</v>

257
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 4>he's been fighting really since 2011.</v>

258
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.660
<v Speaker 4>He has had his first and like 2008 or something.</v>

259
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 4>But really since 2011 he's been fighting.</v>

260
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 4>So the asthma seen that long fair,</v>

261
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:33.010
<v Speaker 4>fairly newbie and Ellenberger is the brother of Jake Ellenberger who is a top</v>

262
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 4>UFC welterweight and Jo Ellen burgers had some serious health issues.</v>

263
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.421
<v Speaker 4>So a,</v>

264
00:06:38.421 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 4>for him just to get into the UFC,</v>

265
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.683
<v Speaker 4>it was been a,</v>

266
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 4>like a lot of people were saying that he was going to die,</v>

267
00:06:44.961 --> 00:06:46.900
<v Speaker 4>who's going to have a very short lifespan.</v>

268
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 4>He would never be able to fight competitively again.</v>

269
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.830
<v Speaker 4>So to see him get in good enough shape to,</v>

270
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:54.560
<v Speaker 4>to fight in the UFC is a huge victory for him.</v>

271
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 4>They said he wouldn't live past like 30 or something crazy like that.</v>

272
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:58.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

273
00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.990
<v Speaker 4>I remember seeing a walkout shirt,</v>

274
00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:00.811
<v Speaker 4>if I'm not mistaken,</v>

275
00:07:00.811 --> 00:07:04.580
<v Speaker 4>that I thought he was like on death's door at the time or something.</v>

276
00:07:04.581 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 4>I forget what it was.</v>

277
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.691
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

278
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:06.590
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't good.</v>

279
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.480
<v Speaker 4>At one point in time it was not good.</v>

280
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.060
<v Speaker 4>So whatever his diseases,</v>

281
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.340
<v Speaker 4>the medication costs 440 grand a year,</v>

282
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Jesus and insurance is gonna cover him.</v>

283
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 4>And he's on that right now.</v>

284
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

285
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

286
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.311
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>

287
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 4>I know that that was the first problem.</v>

288
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

289
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 4>Fucking pharmaceutical companies.</v>

290
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:25.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

291
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 4>you're going to die soon,</v>

292
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 4>but the medication that'll save you is $440,000.</v>

293
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

294
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 4>Let's Jack up some,</v>

295
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:31.520

<v Speaker 4>so we could see what's going on here.</v>

299
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.790
<v Speaker 4>It's just nice to see him realize his dream.</v>

300
00:07:42.791 --> 00:07:43.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

301
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:45.970
<v Speaker 4>it's gotta be a brutal thing to see your,</v>

302
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:46.751
<v Speaker 4>your health slip.</v>

303
00:07:46.751 --> 00:07:46.990
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

304
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.171

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.301
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

308
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:50.431
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

309
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:50.691
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

310
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 4>it has to be a young athlete that's,</v>

311
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

312
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:53.990
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

313
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.823
<v Speaker 4>on,</v>

314
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.570
<v Speaker 4>just about to get on the big stage.</v>

315
00:07:56.571 --> 00:07:57.261
<v Speaker 4>He's just got signed,</v>

316
00:07:57.261 --> 00:07:57.411
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

317
00:07:57.411 --> 00:07:58.244
<v Speaker 4>five years ago?</v>

318
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.881
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

319
00:07:58.881 --> 00:07:59.714
<v Speaker 4>it was quite awhile ago.</v>

320
00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:00.680
<v Speaker 4>This is his first fight.</v>

321
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 4>What do you guys think about that position that keeps coming up over and over</v>

322
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:04.730
<v Speaker 4>again now?</v>

323
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

324
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.370
<v Speaker 4>the travel,</v>

325
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:06.530
<v Speaker 4>I call it the Travis Browne.</v>

326
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 4>When dudes are going for that single and they're clinging onto that leg and they</v>

327
00:08:10.191 --> 00:08:14.240
<v Speaker 4>leave that exposed head and they just get blasted with short turn elbow man.</v>

328
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.661
<v Speaker 4>Woo.</v>

329
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.411
<v Speaker 4>Travis Browne,</v>

330
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:16.940
<v Speaker 4>throw some heat and those elbows.</v>

331
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 4>He's a big scary person.</v>

332
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.010
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

333
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 4>That was exactly where to put it.</v>

334
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 4>Exactly where to put it.</v>

335
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:23.830
<v Speaker 4>He fucking hammer.</v>

336
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 4>Some were repeated.</v>

337
00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:27.200
<v Speaker 4>They're coming down fast and hard.</v>

338
00:08:27.201 --> 00:08:27.501
<v Speaker 4>Boom,</v>

339
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:27.741
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

340
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:28.041
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

341
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:28.311
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

342
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

343
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 4>By the time the referee gets there,</v>

344
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean the referee,</v>

345
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.570
<v Speaker 4>especially if it's a fat referee,</v>

346
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 4>he's got to take three or four steps.</v>

347
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 4>Travis Brown's getting in at least two elbows on an unconscious opponent.</v>

348
00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.560
<v Speaker 4>He played by Josh out just out instantly.</v>

349
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:41.763
<v Speaker 4>No one's ever done that.</v>

350
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.643
<v Speaker 4>Josh,</v>

351
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 4>he Pedro,</v>

352
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 4>his own knocked him out before,</v>

353
00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:47.030
<v Speaker 4>but it was with one perfectly oh cool.</v>

354
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Flying knee attempt there.</v>

355
00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 4>Ellen Burger's got a good team.</v>

356
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 4>Weird and Ellenberger.</v>

357
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:51.824
<v Speaker 4>That's tough.</v>

358
00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:52.663
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

359
00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 4>that knows how to wrestle.</v>

360
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:55.681
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

361
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:56.514
<v Speaker 4>look at this</v>

362
00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:57.663
<v Speaker 2>and working on that.</v>

363
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.280
<v Speaker 2>Doris,</v>

364
00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.910
<v Speaker 2>knock him his body weight on it though.</v>

365
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.833
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

366
00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.413
<v Speaker 2>The struggle.</v>

367
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:02.821
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

368
00:09:02.821 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 2>if you're fighting a guy who is a late replacement,</v>

369
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 2>like Mutasa fee,</v>

370
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 2>this is how you want to fight where I'm out.</v>

371
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're finding guys a late replacement,</v>

372
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.401
<v Speaker 2>you have two options.</v>

373
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:12.380
<v Speaker 2>If you're in Mutasa,</v>

374
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 2>either come in and throw everything you got in the first round or try and</v>

375
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 2>conserve your energy and chose not let them do either one of those.</v>

376
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 2>What was the original opponent?</v>

377
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.233
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

378
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.141
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember.</v>

379
00:09:22.141 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember either,</v>

380
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 2>but Mutasa what did he take this on?</v>

381
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Two weeks notice or something?</v>

382
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:27.864
<v Speaker 2>Something short.</v>

383
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

384
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.240
<v Speaker 1>What do you guys think about that?</v>

385
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Touching the hand on the ground to prevent the knees.</v>

386
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.930
<v Speaker 1>That's that man that,</v>

387
00:09:35.931 --> 00:09:37.450
<v Speaker 1>that seems super silly to me.</v>

388
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 2>You can't do it when a strike is headed for you.</v>

389
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.440
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

390
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.940
<v Speaker 2>So guys do it really early.</v>

391
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:43.013
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

392
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.131
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

393
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:44.964
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

394
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.710
<v Speaker 2>it's always going to be a tactic.</v>

395
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Can't really get around it.</v>

396
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.971
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

397
00:09:47.971 --> 00:09:48.880
<v Speaker 2>last they changed the,</v>

398
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

399
00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 2>he got hit hard and you get hit hard.</v>

400
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:52.501
<v Speaker 2>He does.</v>

401
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:53.111
<v Speaker 2>Eyes aren't open.</v>

402
00:09:53.111 --> 00:09:53.731
<v Speaker 2>He's really hurt.</v>

403
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:53.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

404
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:54.541
<v Speaker 2>he started hard.</v>

405
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:55.374
<v Speaker 2>His eyes hurt,</v>

406
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.383
<v Speaker 2>nose busted.</v>

407
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.770
<v Speaker 2>I think it's his nose because he can't open his eyes.</v>

408
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:00.170
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

409
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.640
<v Speaker 2>When Tasha was getting after him,</v>

410
00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.563
<v Speaker 2>damn.</v>

411
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.960
<v Speaker 6>Lots of back of the head.</v>

412
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 1>He wins design,</v>

413
00:10:08.851 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

414
00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:10.740
<v Speaker 1>Whenever it was that happened,</v>

415
00:10:10.741 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty fucking serious.</v>

416
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It looked like it popped his nose.</v>

417
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:14.454
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

418
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

419
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

420
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 1>we'll probably get a shot at in between rounds,</v>

421
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:19.710
<v Speaker 1>but Mutasa furry is punching and he's just covering up here,</v>

422
00:10:19.711 --> 00:10:20.544
<v Speaker 1>holding on,</v>

423
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>lost the single</v>

424
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.330
<v Speaker 1>and he goes to his back.</v>

425
00:10:26.331 --> 00:10:27.290
<v Speaker 1>He looks like he's all right.</v>

426
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.723
<v Speaker 1>You see blood.</v>

427
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I thought I saw think it's from the nose.</v>

428
00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

429
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.633
<v Speaker 6>Yup.</v>

430
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.411
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

431
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Ellenberger is guard.</v>

432
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:36.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

433
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 1>exposed knows too.</v>

434
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.391
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

435
00:10:38.391 --> 00:10:39.061
<v Speaker 1>This his nose.</v>

436
00:10:39.061 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 1>His nose is bad.</v>

437
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.060
<v Speaker 2>Your vision completely goes when that happens.</v>

438
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.953
<v Speaker 2>Completely.</v>

439
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.850
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

440
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:48.661
<v Speaker 2>Staying aggressive.</v>

441
00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:49.494
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

442
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.000
<v Speaker 1>this is where it's super important to have a guard.</v>

443
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.060
<v Speaker 1>There's so many guys that just don't ever think they're going to be on their</v>

444
00:10:56.061 --> 00:10:56.670
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

445
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

446
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:57.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

447
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.740
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

448
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.110
<v Speaker 1>come on Sophie,</v>

449
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.670
<v Speaker 1>do you see somebody off their back and you're like,</v>

450
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:02.210
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

451
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.350
<v Speaker 1>like you don't know what you're doing.</v>

452
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.400
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what you're doing.</v>

453
00:11:04.401 --> 00:11:05.420
<v Speaker 1>You're completely lost.</v>

454
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to guys who were top level guys and they're like,</v>

455
00:11:08.301 --> 00:11:08.541
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

456
00:11:08.541 --> 00:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be on my back.</v>

457
00:11:09.441 --> 00:11:09.711
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

458
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:10.544
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

459
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.170
<v Speaker 1>well you hope you're not going to be on your back and I hope for you,</v>

460
00:11:14.171 --> 00:11:15.350
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be on your back.</v>

461
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.780
<v Speaker 1>But if you fighting somebody like you,</v>

462
00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:20.060
<v Speaker 1>don't you think you could probably put you on your back?</v>

463
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

464
00:11:20.271 --> 00:11:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Well there's use out there then they're not the only one.</v>

465
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:23.391
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

466
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:27.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea of acting like you're the only guy that can do a certain</v>

467
00:11:27.411 --> 00:11:27.980
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

468
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.820
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

469
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Like thinking you're the only guy that can take you down.</v>

470
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.290
<v Speaker 1>You take guys down so you're going to be on top always.</v>

471
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.820
<v Speaker 1>That seems unlikely.</v>

472
00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 2>There's no weapon in MMA you don't need.</v>

473
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

474
00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.310
<v Speaker 2>When I,</v>

475
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.671
<v Speaker 2>it's funny,</v>

476
00:11:39.671 --> 00:11:41.890
<v Speaker 2>when you talk to guys and you're in the gym and they go out to,</v>

477
00:11:41.891 --> 00:11:42.724
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to,</v>

478
00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to know that,</v>

479
00:11:44.201 --> 00:11:44.980
<v Speaker 2>and I went,</v>

480
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:46.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like going into war and going,</v>

481
00:11:46.031 --> 00:11:46.864
<v Speaker 2>I don't need grenades.</v>

482
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.501
<v Speaker 2>I'll never,</v>

483
00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:49.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll never be in the situation where I need a grenade,</v>

484
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.260
<v Speaker 2>a band at a in that fight fighter on how to get up close.</v>

485
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 2>I want to look them in the went dude.</v>

486
00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:54.011
<v Speaker 2>A life.</v>

487
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:54.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm a sniper.</v>

488
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:55.390
<v Speaker 2>I don't need a grenade.</v>

489
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Well that you're going to be in that position where you go,</v>

490
00:11:57.071 --> 00:11:57.401
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

491
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I just wish I had a grenade right now.</v>

492
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.531
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

493
00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Especially mentality,</v>

494
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:01.140
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

495
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.680
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

496
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Alan burgers.</v>

497
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.521
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

498
00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.510
<v Speaker 1>His nose is fucked.</v>

499
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:04.301
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

500
00:12:04.301 --> 00:12:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Mutasa his mom.</v>

501
00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.803
<v Speaker 1>Good hip escape.</v>

502
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.000
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys don't have to have shitty sweeps in half guard.</v>

503
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.610
<v Speaker 1>Like his goto deep half here.</v>

504
00:12:14.611 --> 00:12:18.510
<v Speaker 1>He's just sorta La langue Langer and around lingering around the in his half</v>

505
00:12:18.511 --> 00:12:19.320
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>

506
00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:19.561
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>

507
00:12:19.561 --> 00:12:21.300
<v Speaker 1>she'd be sucking up to that guy's body.</v>

508
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:23.160
<v Speaker 1>But I think Ellenberger is hurt here.</v>

509
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:24.780
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still trying to recover.</v>

510
00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Half Guard is one of the things you see all the time and high level Jujitsu.</v>

511
00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 2>They have outstanding half cards and you almost never see a good half guard in</v>

512
00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:31.440
<v Speaker 2>MMA.</v>

513
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.130
<v Speaker 1>So true guards and half guard or just anything off your back.</v>

514
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.500
<v Speaker 1>It's is it punches and elbows is,</v>

515
00:12:37.501 --> 00:12:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's gotta be what it is.</v>

516
00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Guys don't want to get punched in elbows.</v>

517
00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:41.034
<v Speaker 1>They just want to hold.</v>

518
00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:43.440
<v Speaker 1>I want to submit somebody,</v>

519
00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:44.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

520
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.533
<v Speaker 1>it's an option.</v>

521
00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:47.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like Daniel Cormier was saying,</v>

522
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.960
<v Speaker 1>we were talking before this thing started that cornea and Dominick Cruz are</v>

523
00:12:51.961 --> 00:12:53.640
<v Speaker 1>fucking killing it as analysts.</v>

524
00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I love listening to those guys talk and their insight,</v>

525
00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.870
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that they were talking about,</v>

526
00:12:57.871 --> 00:12:59.670
<v Speaker 1>the main event cubs cub,</v>

527
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Swanson and Jeremy Stephens was that Jeremy Stevens has got to be a little bit</v>

528
00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:05.220
<v Speaker 1>more unpredictable.</v>

529
00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:07.590
<v Speaker 1>It's got to throw a few more variables into the mix,</v>

530
00:13:07.591 --> 00:13:09.600
<v Speaker 1>like take down attempts and things along those lines.</v>

531
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.340
<v Speaker 1>And I've always said that that's like,</v>

532
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:13.620
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't want to take a guy down,</v>

533
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 1>if you think if you make it,</v>

534
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that you're trying to take him down,</v>

535
00:13:16.951 --> 00:13:19.980
<v Speaker 1>then he has to think about that and it's one more piece of information has to</v>

536
00:13:19.981 --> 00:13:20.730
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

537
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:22.950
<v Speaker 1>If you're only making a guy process stand up,</v>

538
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.420
<v Speaker 1>it's infinitely easier.</v>

539
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:25.493
<v Speaker 1>It's so much easier.</v>

540
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the main reason why George St Pierre was so successful beside the fact that</v>

541
00:13:29.521 --> 00:13:30.630
<v Speaker 1>he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

542
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.510
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the very best at,</v>

543
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:34.050
<v Speaker 1>you didn't know what was going on.</v>

544
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.790
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know if he was going to try to take you down,</v>

545
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:39.600
<v Speaker 1>if he's going to stand up with you and the comfort level that he had because he</v>

546
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:41.070
<v Speaker 1>had fought so many championship fights.</v>

547
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:41.731
<v Speaker 1>He'd been there,</v>

548
00:13:41.731 --> 00:13:42.600
<v Speaker 1>done that many times.</v>

549
00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:43.434
<v Speaker 1>So you'd see guys,</v>

550
00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.490
<v Speaker 1>they'd be in the bright lights.</v>

551
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:44.941
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

552
00:13:44.941 --> 00:13:45.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm fighting GSP,</v>

553
00:13:45.841 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't.</v>

554
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:47.730
<v Speaker 1>It just didn't know what was common.</v>

555
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:52.080
<v Speaker 1>And those two factors together combined for an incredible look at this,</v>

556
00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:53.220
<v Speaker 1>they're checking it,</v>

557
00:13:53.221 --> 00:13:54.240
<v Speaker 1>look just right out in burgers.</v>

558
00:13:54.241 --> 00:13:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Eyes look at his right eye.</v>

559
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.300
<v Speaker 1>Justin Bieber's in the cage with them.</v>

560
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

561
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.510
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

562
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.210
<v Speaker 2>I think they're worried about a fracture when you can't.</v>

563
00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:04.830
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times when the eye drops like that and that's what they're worried</v>

564
00:14:04.831 --> 00:14:05.071
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

565
00:14:05.071 --> 00:14:06.060
<v Speaker 2>but it looks like the letting them go.</v>

566
00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:06.641
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

567
00:14:06.641 --> 00:14:07.690
<v Speaker 1>it could be a fracture.</v>

568
00:14:07.691 --> 00:14:09.550
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times it's a fracture of the eye swells up.</v>

569
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.011
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

570
00:14:10.011 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 2>And that's a lit drops and they can't really move the eye.</v>

571
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:12.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

572
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.940
<v Speaker 2>that's what it seems like they're,</v>

573
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.330
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

574
00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.280
<v Speaker 2>Look at what it looks like.</v>

575
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:16.820
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

576
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:17.631
<v Speaker 1>Yo.</v>

577
00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:19.340
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen it closed on like that.</v>

578
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:20.031
<v Speaker 1>It looks weird.</v>

579
00:14:20.031 --> 00:14:20.660
<v Speaker 1>It's like sloths,</v>

580
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.050
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

581
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.980
<v Speaker 1>You know what it looks like.</v>

582
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.180
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the nerves in his,</v>

583
00:14:23.181 --> 00:14:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I just stopped working like it's not swollen up.</v>

584
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:26.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just shutting.</v>

585
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:27.561
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

586
00:14:27.561 --> 00:14:27.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

587
00:14:27.771 --> 00:14:28.810
<v Speaker 1>he was wincing for a reason.</v>

588
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.340
<v Speaker 1>He's probably fucked on that side.</v>

589
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.770
<v Speaker 1>He probably can't see left hooks at all though.</v>

590
00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.343
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

591
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:36.831
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>

592
00:14:36.831 --> 00:14:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

593
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:38.023
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

594
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.680
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy who's going through a situation like Ellenberger as you can't help</v>

595
00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:43.514
<v Speaker 1>but root for them.</v>

596
00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:44.450
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

597
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.283
<v Speaker 1>Mutasa Murray,</v>

598
00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.800
<v Speaker 1>he's dealing with a great fucking job in this fight is especially on short</v>

599
00:14:48.801 --> 00:14:49.131
<v Speaker 1>notice.</v>

600
00:14:49.131 --> 00:14:49.964
<v Speaker 1>It looks very good.</v>

601
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>What's funny to about,</v>

602
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>like</v>

603
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 2>we were saying about not,</v>

604
00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

605
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.720
<v Speaker 2>not having complete games,</v>

606
00:14:56.721 --> 00:15:00.500
<v Speaker 2>is that something that happens in all combat sports and yet people don't think</v>

607
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:01.700
<v Speaker 2>it applies him in boxing.</v>

608
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.121
<v Speaker 2>They always say,</v>

609
00:15:02.121 --> 00:15:03.320
<v Speaker 2>if you can't sell the Jab,</v>

610
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to buy your right hand if I don't sell.</v>

611
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 2>If you don't sell me on the first one,</v>

612
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:08.240
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get the combination.</v>

613
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 2>And people don't think that way in MMA,</v>

614
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:10.850
<v Speaker 2>which is a little strange.</v>

615
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:11.371
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

616
00:15:11.371 --> 00:15:11.701
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

617
00:15:11.701 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 1>and right here Ellenberger has gotten tossed.</v>

618
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.120
<v Speaker 1>She's back very nice.</v>

619
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.430
<v Speaker 1>And he has a leg in on the cage side,</v>

620
00:15:17.431 --> 00:15:18.570
<v Speaker 1>which is the hard side to get in.</v>

621
00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:22.560
<v Speaker 1>So fucking hard to get a rear naked choke with these goddamn gloves.</v>

622
00:15:22.561 --> 00:15:23.394
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

623
00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.290
<v Speaker 1>For folks who just do Jujitsu,</v>

624
00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:28.920
<v Speaker 1>do yourself a favor one day and do some Oola like I was trapping the arm,</v>

625
00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.730
<v Speaker 1>do some Gigi,</v>

626
00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:32.520
<v Speaker 1>got the both hooks and do some Jujitsu with gloves on.</v>

627
00:15:32.521 --> 00:15:33.870
<v Speaker 1>You'll be astounded at.</v>

628
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.850
<v Speaker 1>It makes chokes 20% harder.</v>

629
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.350
<v Speaker 1>20% hard to get.</v>

630
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

631
00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I would take the item with my leg.</v>

632
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

633
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

634
00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:41.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

635
00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:43.800
<v Speaker 1>especially after having Bj do it to me.</v>

636
00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.933
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

637
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.010
<v Speaker 1>it's just frightening.</v>

638
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:47.501
<v Speaker 1>Bj.</v>

639
00:15:47.501 --> 00:15:48.540
<v Speaker 1>So good at that.</v>

640
00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.610
<v Speaker 1>He loves getting that rear naked choke.</v>

641
00:15:50.611 --> 00:15:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Trapping the arms.</v>

642
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:52.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

643
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.310
<v Speaker 1>it's been,</v>

644
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:53.520
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

645
00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.300
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

646
00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.100
<v Speaker 1>he's only 160 pounds.</v>

647
00:15:56.490 --> 00:16:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I was 150 going out there and he felt so heavy on top.</v>

648
00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Was He so good on the ground?</v>

649
00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:05.220
<v Speaker 1>It's just ridiculous.</v>

650
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

651
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Bj in his prime was one of the elite of the elite in Jujitsu.</v>

652
00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

653
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 1>A lot of folks don't know that and he got there quick</v>

654
00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:12.861
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>

655
00:16:12.861 --> 00:16:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Non Brazilian wold champion took it in three years.</v>

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:15.831
<v Speaker 2>Three years.</v>

657
00:16:15.831 --> 00:16:16.890
<v Speaker 2>He got his black belt.</v>

658
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Boom one the one the owls.</v>

662
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.270
<v Speaker 1>If he pulls this off,</v>

663
00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:27.104
<v Speaker 1>good for it.</v>

664
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:28.251
<v Speaker 1>He needs it.</v>

665
00:16:28.251 --> 00:16:29.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't help but root for the guy.</v>

666
00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Got a lot of space there under that right armpit though,</v>

728
00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's not implemented.</v>

729
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.260
<v Speaker 2>Those fights.</v>

730
00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.830
<v Speaker 3>Finding three guys in awe.</v>

731
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.890
<v Speaker 3>Imposturous they had Shane come out.</v>

732
00:18:02.891 --> 00:18:03.071
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

733
00:18:03.071 --> 00:18:04.600
<v Speaker 3>granted Shane isn't,</v>

734
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:05.381
<v Speaker 3>isn't in shape,</v>

735
00:18:05.381 --> 00:18:08.700
<v Speaker 3>ever throws up after every time he works out.</v>

736
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.760
<v Speaker 3>The guy's just really talented,</v>

737
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:11.470
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

738
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.360
<v Speaker 3>from the last punch he threw,</v>

739
00:18:13.361 --> 00:18:14.800
<v Speaker 3>they waited 30 minutes and the,</v>

740
00:18:14.801 --> 00:18:15.880
<v Speaker 3>and that's what they said.</v>

741
00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.013
<v Speaker 3>He literally,</v>

742

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

743

<v Speaker 3>they read that he won,</v>

745
00:18:19.241 --> 00:18:20.170
<v Speaker 3>he walked in the back,</v>

746
00:18:20.171 --> 00:18:21.940
<v Speaker 3>they get changed as gloves and then he walked back out.</v>

747
00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:24.700
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

748
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:24.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

749
00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure Joe's was just as hard.</v>

750
00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.393
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.533
<v Speaker 3>He fought in the featherweight.</v>

765
00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.480
<v Speaker 3>I need to the finals loss to a Varga.</v>

766
00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.240
<v Speaker 3>He's huge at that weight.</v>

767
00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.390
<v Speaker 3>I was wake up with him and he missed it and I was fucking pissed.</v>

768
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.000
<v Speaker 3>Any medicine.</v>

769
00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.920
<v Speaker 3>I was like so mad.</v>

770
00:18:47.921 --> 00:18:50.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how bad the domestic bar two pounds</v>

771
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:54.591
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>

772
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:56.420
<v Speaker 2>for the beginning fighters listening to this,</v>

773
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:57.343
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

774
00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.440
<v Speaker 2>nothing will piss off or promoted more than not making weight.</v>

775
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:04.580
<v Speaker 2>It is pretty much like not showing up for work on like your second day,</v>

776
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.200
<v Speaker 2>you'll get canned fast.</v>

777
00:19:06.201 --> 00:19:06.740
<v Speaker 2>They hate that.</v>

778
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.340
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

779
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:07.641
<v Speaker 2>Ian,</v>

780
00:19:07.641 --> 00:19:08.440
<v Speaker 2>obviously you</v>

781
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:08.921
<v Speaker 3>close to this,</v>

782
00:19:08.921 --> 00:19:11.110
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to look at it objectively,</v>

783
00:19:11.111 --> 00:19:14.050
<v Speaker 3>but do you think that they should abandon weight cutting?</v>

784
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they should move to abandoned weight cutting.</v>

785
00:19:16.121 --> 00:19:19.060
<v Speaker 3>And do you think it's ever possible to abandoned weight cutting?</v>

786
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:20.651
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

787
00:19:20.651 --> 00:19:21.460
<v Speaker 3>they should.</v>

788
00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:21.911
<v Speaker 3>Healthier.</v>

789
00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure I'd take a few years off my life every time I do it.</v>

790
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.980
<v Speaker 3>So I mean like when I cut in Florida,</v>

791
00:19:26.981 --> 00:19:29.050
<v Speaker 3>I cut 18.8 in the last 20 hours.</v>

792
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

793
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.410
<v Speaker 3>And I felt like at first you're hearing goes yeah.</v>

794
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:33.850
<v Speaker 3>And then your,</v>

795
00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:38.290
<v Speaker 3>your vision goes and then you feel your body start to cramp up and you're like,</v>

796
00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking dying.</v>

797
00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.421
<v Speaker 3>Literally.</v>

798
00:19:40.421 --> 00:19:40.661
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

799
00:19:40.661 --> 00:19:41.261
<v Speaker 3>I'm literally,</v>

800
00:19:41.261 --> 00:19:42.790
<v Speaker 3>this is how people die.</v>

801
00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.850
<v Speaker 3>And then you have to put on a smile,</v>

802
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.040
<v Speaker 3>walk out and stare at the person.</v>

803
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:47.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

804
00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:49.690
<v Speaker 3>Flex and stare at the person that you're going to fight tomorrow.</v>

805
00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:50.531
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

806
00:19:50.531 --> 00:19:51.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

807
00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:53.720
<v Speaker 3>then you get to drink and take a couple of sips of PD,</v>

808
00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.680
<v Speaker 3>like right after he stepped off the scale because you're literally dying.</v>

809
00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I've seen some people that look like they're dying,</v>

810
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.630
<v Speaker 2>tried to in the NCAAs a few years ago for those that follow it,</v>

811
00:20:02.631 --> 00:20:03.350
<v Speaker 2>they add,</v>

812
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:06.530
<v Speaker 2>you weighed in once and then you had the whole NCAA tournament,</v>

813
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:07.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

814
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:08.870
<v Speaker 2>so you went in once and then he wrestled for three days.</v>

815
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:10.033
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

816
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.500
<v Speaker 2>then a kid at Michigan died cutting weight.</v>

817
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:12.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

818
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.430
<v Speaker 2>It was Kinda like tried to make it easier by having one weight cut and then they</v>

819
00:20:16.431 --> 00:20:17.241
<v Speaker 2>could wrestle three days.</v>

820
00:20:17.241 --> 00:20:21.140
<v Speaker 2>And then they realized that just encouraged people to cut more weight and a kid</v>

821
00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:23.330
<v Speaker 2>from Michigan died and now you've got to weigh in every time.</v>

822
00:20:23.331 --> 00:20:25.220
<v Speaker 2>And it's like when they make it harder,</v>

823
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

824
00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:26.811
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

825
00:20:26.811 --> 00:20:27.261
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

826
00:20:27.261 --> 00:20:28.520
<v Speaker 2>how can meet people weigh in and then fight?</v>

827
00:20:28.521 --> 00:20:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

828
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.770
<v Speaker 2>it encourages people to cut less weight.</v>

829
00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:31.231
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

830
00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:32.540
<v Speaker 2>it's just you can't win.</v>

831
00:20:32.541 --> 00:20:36.620
<v Speaker 2>When they tried to make it like you had a day in between guys just cut more</v>

832
00:20:36.621 --> 00:20:38.090
<v Speaker 2>weight because they had a day to rehydrate.</v>

833
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.380
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>

834
00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:40.670

<v Speaker 4>It's a hugely coveted Olympic sport.</v>

870

<v Speaker 4>whoever won the kids one that they would buy the dinner or the,</v>

874
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:51.460
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

875
00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.360
<v Speaker 4>the Lizard by the dinner.</v>

876
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.320
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Christ.</v>

877
00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:57.250
<v Speaker 4>He'd be in the sauna with me massaging me like a 16 year old kid cutting weight,</v>

878
00:21:57.790 --> 00:21:58.391
<v Speaker 4>massaging me,</v>

879
00:21:58.391 --> 00:21:58.801
<v Speaker 4>trying to meet,</v>

880
00:21:58.801 --> 00:21:59.381
<v Speaker 4>get me to cut weight.</v>

881
00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:01.180
<v Speaker 4>And He'd been looking at us at us and they were like,</v>

882
00:22:01.181 --> 00:22:02.680
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this old man doing?</v>

883
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.210
<v Speaker 4>Does he have a little boy making him sweat in here?</v>

884
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:07.340
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

885
00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:08.640
<v Speaker 4>the thing about me in high school was smaller,</v>

886
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.420
<v Speaker 4>was the hundred and three pounds.</v>

887
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:11.570
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

888
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

889
00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.190
<v Speaker 4>cluster one three,</v>

890
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.740
<v Speaker 4>three,</v>

891
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.010
<v Speaker 4>three is 12 and nineteens.</v>

892
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:18.040
<v Speaker 4>And what would you actually way before he started the cut,</v>

893
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:24.070
<v Speaker 4>I remember by senior year I was probably 35.</v>

894
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:25.540
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

895
00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:28.210
<v Speaker 4>I was supposed to cut weight in high school,</v>

896
00:22:28.211 --> 00:22:29.140
<v Speaker 4>but I wouldn't do it.</v>

897
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:34.320
<v Speaker 4>So I walked around at 135 pounds on a Russell 134 pounds cause I was like,</v>

898
00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:35.483
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing it.</v>

899
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.880
<v Speaker 4>I just like you guys are dying.</v>

900
00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 4>I see it all around me.</v>

901
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.930
<v Speaker 4>There was a kid that was a one weight class above me,</v>

902
00:22:40.931 --> 00:22:42.280
<v Speaker 4>this really big,</v>

903
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.290
<v Speaker 4>a really big tall kid.</v>

904
00:22:44.291 --> 00:22:45.370
<v Speaker 4>I forget what his name is,</v>

905
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.790
<v Speaker 4>but he used to weigh like he would wrestle at one 40 something and he would</v>

906
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:56.011
<v Speaker 4>weigh 170 pounds and I just didn't understand that he was a big kid.</v>

907
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.531
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

908
00:22:56.531 --> 00:22:58.190
<v Speaker 4>we were 15 at the time where he meet,</v>

909
00:22:58.191 --> 00:22:59.080
<v Speaker 4>he might've been a little older,</v>

910
00:22:59.081 --> 00:23:04.081
<v Speaker 4>maybe 16 but he was a big kid and I was watching this guy put on rubber suits</v>

911
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:09.190
<v Speaker 4>and run up hills and rolling around with covered in towels and shit.</v>

912
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.970
<v Speaker 4>And I was like hiding under the wrestling mats,</v>

913
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.850
<v Speaker 4>translating under the wrestling mat.</v>

914
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:14.423
<v Speaker 4>I'm not doing it.</v>

915
00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.660
<v Speaker 4>And I cut weight a few times for Taekwondo tournaments.</v>

916
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.430
<v Speaker 4>And then I went up a weight class and fought,</v>

917
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:21.700
<v Speaker 4>I weighed one 54 [inaudible] 54 it was just,</v>

918
00:23:21.790 --> 00:23:22.121
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>

919
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:22.781
<v Speaker 4>it was way better.</v>

920
00:23:22.781 --> 00:23:24.220
<v Speaker 4>I was just too lean anyway.</v>

921
00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:25.660
<v Speaker 4>I was always walking around,</v>

922
00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:26.890
<v Speaker 4>very low body fat.</v>

923
00:23:26.891 --> 00:23:28.840
<v Speaker 4>So I just felt terrible.</v>

924
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.450
<v Speaker 4>The worst I ever saw was Marcos Galvan.</v>

925
00:23:31.451 --> 00:23:32.051
<v Speaker 4>He fought chase,</v>

926
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:32.980
<v Speaker 4>BB and Beltre.</v>

927
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.880
<v Speaker 4>He could barely get on the scale.</v>

928
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.800
<v Speaker 4>He couldn't walk.</v>

929
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 4>And then he got off the scale and he was going to the elevator and he sat down</v>

930
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 4>and he started convulsing.</v>

931
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 4>He started shaking.</v>

932
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 4>And what people don't understand is next day against chase</v>

933
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:46.760
<v Speaker 2>BBI,</v>

934
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.520
<v Speaker 2>he looked great.</v>

935
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:49.940
<v Speaker 2>Phenomenal.</v>

936
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 2>The amount they get back almost encourages that kind of shit when you go.</v>

937
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.600
<v Speaker 2>If they walked in there and just felt so bad,</v>

938
00:23:56.601 --> 00:23:57.434
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't fight,</v>

939
00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:57.910
<v Speaker 2>you'd,</v>

940
00:23:57.910 --> 00:23:59.030
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't see guys do it.</v>

941
00:23:59.120 --> 00:23:59.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

942
00:23:59.281 --> 00:24:00.500
<v Speaker 2>they wrote to cover some of that,</v>

943
00:24:00.501 --> 00:24:01.700
<v Speaker 2>encourages them to do it.</v>

944
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.270
<v Speaker 2>You do</v>

945
00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:03.230
<v Speaker 1>some guys that you,</v>

946
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:03.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

947
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:04.191
<v Speaker 1>they're taking,</v>

948
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

949
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 1>they're hurting.</v>

950
00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

951
00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:05.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

952
00:24:05.841 --> 00:24:08.940
<v Speaker 1>they get down to like a perfect example is a,</v>

953
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.190
<v Speaker 1>that dude who,</v>

954
00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:10.521
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

955
00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:11.060
<v Speaker 1>was uh,</v>

956
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Seraphim who is a killer at 185 pounds,</v>

957
00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 1>just fought at one 70.</v>

958
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.870
<v Speaker 1>And you can see for the moment he stepped into the octagon,</v>

959
00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:18.201
<v Speaker 1>he was just,</v>

960
00:24:18.201 --> 00:24:21.260
<v Speaker 1>he barely made weight and the moment he stepped in the octagon,</v>

961
00:24:21.261 --> 00:24:22.890
<v Speaker 1>he just didn't do it.</v>

962
00:24:22.891 --> 00:24:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't grab it.</v>

963
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.560
<v Speaker 1>It was just missing.</v>

964
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:25.910
<v Speaker 1>His timing was off.</v>

965
00:24:25.911 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 1>His strength was off.</v>

966
00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:27.470
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

967
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.370
<v Speaker 1>he just didn't have it.</v>

968
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.840
<v Speaker 1>Marquardt just decided to go back up to 85 beats to Huna last night.</v>

969
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:33.771
<v Speaker 1>What did he say?</v>

970
00:24:33.771 --> 00:24:34.604
<v Speaker 1>God made him,</v>

971
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.720
<v Speaker 1>God made him do it.</v>

972
00:24:35.721 --> 00:24:38.260
<v Speaker 1>God told him to fight at 105 yes.</v>

973
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Don't you questioning God.</v>

974
00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Fuck no bro.</v>

975
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Slap on this triangle.</v>

976
00:24:44.991 --> 00:24:48.270
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's a little tighter with it now guys.</v>

977
00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.400
<v Speaker 1>One angle their hips enough.</v>

978
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:50.503
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

979
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.070
<v Speaker 1>I also don't know rubber guard.</v>

980
00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:52.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

981
00:24:52.581 --> 00:24:52.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

982
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:55.400
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people are prejudice against Eddie Bravo techniques,</v>

983
00:24:55.401 --> 00:24:57.620
<v Speaker 1>but that fucking mission control to triangle,</v>

984
00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:59.300
<v Speaker 1>they don't know how to attack off their back with anything.</v>

985
00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:01.240
<v Speaker 1>The rubber garden.</v>

986
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.540
<v Speaker 1>MMA is one of the best moves ever because you can hold a guy down with your arm,</v>

987
00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.240
<v Speaker 1>you grab him and you're not just pulling down with your arm.</v>

988
00:25:08.241 --> 00:25:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You point down with your legs as well and if you have a good triangle set up off</v>

989
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:12.470
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

990
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.970
<v Speaker 1>it's just a phenomenal move.</v>

991
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 1>So many guys don't do it,</v>

992
00:25:16.101 --> 00:25:19.910
<v Speaker 1>so you're left just trying to use your legs to pull the guy down or your reach</v>

993
00:25:19.911 --> 00:25:21.170
<v Speaker 1>up and grab his neck.</v>

994
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:22.130
<v Speaker 1>He knows what you're doing.</v>

995
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.940
<v Speaker 1>If you get your hand that under hook on that ankle and you're pulling down on</v>

996
00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:28.100
<v Speaker 1>that ankle with good flexibility at good rubber guard,</v>

997
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.130
<v Speaker 1>that mission control position is a devastating position.</v>

998
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:34.400
<v Speaker 2>But even coming from in,</v>

999
00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.181
<v Speaker 2>in my case,</v>

1000
00:25:35.181 --> 00:25:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Carlson Gracie style,</v>

1001
00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:36.650
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1002
00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:37.910
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot of open guard still like that,</v>

1003
00:25:37.911 --> 00:25:40.040
<v Speaker 2>like mural Bustamante hips are always moving.</v>

1004
00:25:40.041 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 2>They're just active the whole time.</v>

1005
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:42.500
<v Speaker 2>When you believe in that or not,</v>

1006
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.330
<v Speaker 2>no matter what your school is,</v>

1007
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.040
<v Speaker 2>it's active hips and active fundamentals and,</v>

1008
00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 2>and guys have surprising a little of that,</v>

1009
00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1010
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:50.900
<v Speaker 2>well Jeeva is my coach.</v>

1011
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.160
<v Speaker 2>She was a stud.</v>

1012
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:53.180
<v Speaker 2>People don't know.</v>

1013
00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Jake shields just came in and rolled and Jake always been had an open invitation</v>

1014
00:25:57.621 --> 00:25:59.160
<v Speaker 2>of the gym and he just shutting up one night.</v>

1015

1056
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.500
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] I think.</v>

1057
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.390
<v Speaker 4>I think it's we're past that point.</v>

1058
00:26:54.391 --> 00:26:54.491
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1059
00:26:54.491 --> 00:26:56.190
<v Speaker 4>It used to be in his prime and it's oral.</v>

1060
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:57.083
<v Speaker 4>Heavyweight wise.</v>

1061
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:58.680
<v Speaker 4>I don't Demian Maia has got a great one.</v>

1062
00:26:58.681 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1063
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.630
<v Speaker 4>I don't totally agree with that.</v>

1064
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 4>I think [inaudible] a pad and amazing guard,</v>

1065
00:27:04.111 --> 00:27:05.130
<v Speaker 4>but if you put,</v>

1066
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.450
<v Speaker 4>I believe if you put from BC,</v>

1067
00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.590
<v Speaker 4>we're doing the same scenario,</v>

1068
00:27:07.591 --> 00:27:08.790
<v Speaker 4>he would tap those guys quicker.</v>

1069
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.390
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1070
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1071
00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody's better than off their back then Virginia.</v>

1072
00:27:12.361 --> 00:27:13.350
<v Speaker 4>He is outstanding.</v>

1073
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:14.260
<v Speaker 4>He is really grave.</v>

1074
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:14.551
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1075
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:15.384
<v Speaker 4>he's insane.</v>

1076
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.800
<v Speaker 4>The way he keeps his feet on the hips.</v>

1077
00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:18.090
<v Speaker 4>We keeps guys moving around.</v>

1078
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.380
<v Speaker 4>You watched that fate or fight.</v>

1079
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.140
<v Speaker 4>It's not just impressive the way he submitted him.</v>

1080
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.210
<v Speaker 4>It's like the fight was over.</v>

1081
00:27:24.211 --> 00:27:28.310
<v Speaker 4>As soon as he was locked up in a skosh took it out of mid air.</v>

1082
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.400
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like he fell into it.</v>

1083
00:27:29.410 --> 00:27:29.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1084
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Carl never could do that.</v>

1085
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.940
<v Speaker 4>I mean minutes take a line.</v>

1086
00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:36.750
<v Speaker 4>He would take a ton of damage and it gets them and allows them to go,</v>

1087
00:27:36.751 --> 00:27:37.680
<v Speaker 4>is this really worth it?</v>

1088
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.990
<v Speaker 4>You are getting the years beaten out of you,</v>

1089
00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:40.141
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1090
00:27:40.141 --> 00:27:40.860
<v Speaker 4>But he didn't,</v>

1091
00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.170
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't pull it off in his prime on fader.</v>

1092
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 4>Granted,</v>

1093
00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 4>fader was in his prime in that fight and he wasn't in his prime.</v>

1094
00:27:46.591 --> 00:27:47.424
<v Speaker 4>In the boardroom fight.</v>

1095
00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:47.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1096
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:49.510
<v Speaker 4>but still for doing them.</v>

1097
00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:51.860
<v Speaker 4>I think I just went just amazing during it.</v>

1098
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:52.950
<v Speaker 4>I think he's the best.</v>

1099
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:54.440
<v Speaker 4>You know who's really good at,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's wicked off his battery.</v>

1105
00:27:59.071 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 4>Good Guard.</v>

1106
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.080
<v Speaker 4>Wicked standing up to men.</v>

1116
00:28:08.271 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 4>on that to Hoonah card.</v>

1117
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.010
<v Speaker 4>Ellenberger wins a decision.</v>

1118
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 4>Haufle Ellenberger good for him,</v>

1128
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.380
<v Speaker 4>trying to find the fight card here.</v>

1129
00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:33.060
<v Speaker 4>Is the ufc.com not the best fucking website in the world.</v>

1130
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:36.630

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:41.630
<v Speaker 4>he fought hot Sukiyaki and he beat hot Sukiyaki decision or I don't know.</v>

1132
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen it yet.</v>

1133
00:28:44.251 --> 00:28:45.750
<v Speaker 4>We could watch that later.</v>

1134
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:47.250
<v Speaker 4>Shinya Yogi for a lot of years,</v>

1135
00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.560
<v Speaker 4>I think had the best one of the best guards in MMA.</v>

1136
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>

1137
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.053
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1138
00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.650
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about the tights like that?</v>

1139
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:56.670
<v Speaker 4>That was like the big thing that he wore tights in pride,</v>

1140
00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:57.990
<v Speaker 4>which are great for traction.</v>

1141
00:28:58.010 --> 00:28:58.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.570
<v Speaker 4>But they wouldn't let him wear it when he fought anywhere else.</v>

1143
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:02.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't really understand that.</v>

1144
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:04.080
<v Speaker 4>He stopped too key.</v>

1145
00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 4>It was the first time hot.</v>

1146
00:29:06.871 --> 00:29:07.311
<v Speaker 4>So he oak,</v>

1147
00:29:07.311 --> 00:29:08.800
<v Speaker 4>he got stopped and by the way,</v>

1148
00:29:08.801 --> 00:29:08.921
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

1149
00:29:08.921 --> 00:29:13.840
<v Speaker 4>Yo key just a couple of years ago was thought of as the number one guy had 145</v>

1150
00:29:13.841 --> 00:29:16.450
<v Speaker 4>pounds and uh,</v>

1151
00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.750
<v Speaker 4>has not done so he got an arm and guillotine.</v>

1152
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.370
<v Speaker 4>He got them with an army gating.</v>

1153
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.220
<v Speaker 4>The way he cinched it up,</v>

1154
00:29:24.221 --> 00:29:26.290
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a lucky,</v>

1155
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.700
<v Speaker 4>wrapped it up Dar style.</v>

1156
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.113
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

1157
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.060
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>

1158
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:32.893

<v Speaker 2>Those long arm dudes man.</v>

1176
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.630
<v Speaker 2>They just really know how to get those certain submissions.</v>

1177
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.180
<v Speaker 2>That was the worst spinning back by not good.</v>

1178
00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 2>Not good at all.</v>

1179
00:29:59.771 --> 00:30:01.210
<v Speaker 2>Fitting bat buck kick.</v>

1180
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:05.770
<v Speaker 2>But a props to that dude for a taking that fight on short notice like last</v>

1181
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:05.830
<v Speaker 2>minute.</v>

1182
00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.880
<v Speaker 2>I think a little prep.</v>

1183
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:07.301
<v Speaker 2>You might have one.</v>

1184
00:30:07.301 --> 00:30:07.900
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

1185
00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:08.770
<v Speaker 3>It's a good fight too.</v>

1186
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.060
<v Speaker 3>It was a fun fight.</v>

1187
00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.300
<v Speaker 3>Close ass kicked for the first five minutes.</v>

1188
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Fucking I looked pretty bad man.</v>

1189
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 3>That I looked real bad.</v>

1190
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.720
<v Speaker 3>So let's see what else we got here.</v>

1191
00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.890
<v Speaker 3>What is next?</v>

1192
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 3>This fucking fight card.</v>

1193
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:25.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm so excited about this main event.</v>

1194
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.610
<v Speaker 3>I know it's real close to your buddy and I know it's hard for you,</v>

1195
00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.470
<v Speaker 3>but I'm excited about this.</v>

1196
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 3>I just sometimes I just don't want to see my friends get beat up course.</v>

1197
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:37.331
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1198
00:30:37.331 --> 00:30:38.290
<v Speaker 3>It makes it understandable.</v>

1199
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I don't mind getting beat up myself.</v>

1200
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1201
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.673
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather not.</v>

1202
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:45.641
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1203
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:46.440
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1204
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.660
<v Speaker 3>a lot of guys say that it's harder when you walk in your teammates up then that</v>

1205
00:30:49.661 --> 00:30:50.860
<v Speaker 3>is when you're walking yourself up.</v>

1206
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:52.150
<v Speaker 3>Do you feel like that completely.</v>

1207
00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:52.381
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1208
00:30:52.381 --> 00:30:53.214
<v Speaker 3>cause I,</v>

1209
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 3>I just want to go,</v>

1210
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:55.840
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm doing,</v>

1211
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:56.261
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1212
00:30:56.261 --> 00:30:59.860
<v Speaker 3>I can control what's going on and usually it ends up pretty well.</v>

1213
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 3>So I just,</v>

1214
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:02.350
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1215
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.891
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

1216
00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:03.880
<v Speaker 3>But whether the people,</v>

1217
00:31:03.881 --> 00:31:06.700
<v Speaker 3>it's like sometimes you're thinking you suck at this,</v>

1218
00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.930
<v Speaker 3>you suck at that,</v>

1219
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.891
<v Speaker 3>don't do that.</v>

1220
00:31:08.891 --> 00:31:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Don't look at me and smile and get thrown.</v>

1221
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.090
<v Speaker 3>Like that's the worst</v>

1222
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.930
<v Speaker 2>I have heard in my career some really horrible coaching.</v>

1223
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:16.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

1224
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:17.580
<v Speaker 2>that stands out to me.</v>

1225
00:31:17.581 --> 00:31:18.900
<v Speaker 2>I think more than anything when you're,</v>

1226
00:31:18.901 --> 00:31:21.060
<v Speaker 2>when you're commentating in like in between rounds,</v>

1227
00:31:21.061 --> 00:31:21.241
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1228
00:31:21.241 --> 00:31:25.440
<v Speaker 2>I know we pay per view and on TV is very different depending on what you do,</v>

1229
00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:26.930
<v Speaker 2>whether or not we see the routes,</v>

1230
00:31:26.931 --> 00:31:27.151
<v Speaker 2>see the,</v>

1231
00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:29.850
<v Speaker 2>see the coaches in between rounds is up to the producer and all this stuff.</v>

1232
00:31:29.851 --> 00:31:33.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot of times where I'm sitting there watching the coach and you know,</v>

1233
00:31:33.421 --> 00:31:35.820
<v Speaker 2>play by play guys doing something and I'm like,</v>

1234
00:31:35.821 --> 00:31:38.360
<v Speaker 2>that is the worst advice I have ever heard of.</v>

1235
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1236
00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.180
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1237
00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.860
<v Speaker 2>like they don't know what they're talking about.</v>

1238
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.341
<v Speaker 2>I liked the,</v>

1239
00:31:41.341 --> 00:31:42.420
<v Speaker 2>it'll say the awful,</v>

1240
00:31:42.450 --> 00:31:43.500
<v Speaker 2>you will say that though.</v>

1241
00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:44.041
<v Speaker 2>You will say,</v>

1242
00:31:44.041 --> 00:31:44.874
<v Speaker 2>well I'm out man.</v>

1243
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah I will.</v>

1244
00:31:45.931 --> 00:31:49.080
<v Speaker 2>I'll call it like they're pissing me later to add sometimes I've got a couple</v>

1245
00:31:49.081 --> 00:31:52.680
<v Speaker 2>people mad at me but I like that it's just a word or you're winning this fight</v>

1246
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.461
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

1247
00:31:53.461 --> 00:31:55.380
<v Speaker 2>what fight are you looking at?</v>

1248
00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:57.460
<v Speaker 2>You are down four rounds to none.</v>

1249
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.970
<v Speaker 2>That's never good to lie to you.</v>

1250
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Fighter cheerleading.</v>

1251
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Some guy he cheerleading the McCoy's still.</v>

1252
00:32:03.061 --> 00:32:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Some guys are really,</v>

1253
00:32:04.021 --> 00:32:04.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1254
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.183
<v Speaker 2>I think he's the best.</v>

1255
00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:06.203
<v Speaker 2>Matt Hume.</v>

1256
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.133
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>

1257
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.280
<v Speaker 2>He's so specific.</v>

1258
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.370
<v Speaker 2>So specific about what's going on and what,</v>

1259
00:32:11.371 --> 00:32:14.460
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing wrong or what you could do to make that a little bit better.</v>

1260
00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Very technical.</v>

1261
00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:19.200
<v Speaker 2>And then you'll hear other guys where it's like it's you all day long.</v>

1262
00:32:19.201 --> 00:32:20.100
<v Speaker 2>Put your punches together.</v>

1263
00:32:20.101 --> 00:32:21.870
<v Speaker 2>Like they say a bunch of shit pushed the pace.</v>

1264
00:32:21.871 --> 00:32:22.700
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you say?</v>

1265
00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:23.700
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying anything.</v>

1266
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.120
<v Speaker 2>The worst one,</v>

1267
00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:31.130
<v Speaker 2>the worst I remember distinctly was Bj Penn's corner saying go at him.</v>

1268
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1269
00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:34.100
<v Speaker 2>for an over,</v>

1270
00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it was actually the Jens Pulver finds his way back for the old fans and</v>

1271
00:32:38.341 --> 00:32:41.530
<v Speaker 2>they're going go him Hilo style like 20 times.</v>

1272
00:32:41.531 --> 00:32:44.180
<v Speaker 2>And I went that you're not saying anything.</v>

1273
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.200
<v Speaker 2>It was low style,</v>

1274
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.050
<v Speaker 2>but it was like his tenement had always gotten that far.</v>

1275
00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 2>So when it didn't work,</v>

1276
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.600
<v Speaker 2>they didn't know what to do.</v>

1277
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 2>It's like we never coached him before.</v>

1278
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Why are we going to start now?</v>

1279
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.750
<v Speaker 2>It's soup.</v>

1280
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

1281
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.560
<v Speaker 2>I remember laughing mammals too.</v>

1282
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1283
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.210
<v Speaker 2>When you have that dynamic of one guy,</v>

1284
00:32:58.250 --> 00:32:58.800
<v Speaker 2>the Alpha,</v>

1285
00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.840
<v Speaker 2>the Super Alpha,</v>

1286
00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:00.860
<v Speaker 2>have you been here Jay?</v>

1287
00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:01.341
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1288
00:33:01.341 --> 00:33:01.941
<v Speaker 2>I've been to Hilo,</v>

1289
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:03.200
<v Speaker 2>but I've never been to Bj's camp.</v>

1290
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I stayed just stayed at his parents' house.</v>

1291
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:05.863
<v Speaker 2>What does it like?</v>

1292
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:06.890
<v Speaker 2>It's so much fun.</v>

1293
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I would move there if I could.</v>

1294
00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:08.811
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

1295
00:33:08.811 --> 00:33:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

1296
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.221
<v Speaker 2>So beautiful.</v>

1297
00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:11.054
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a,</v>

1298
00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 2>it's like the tech,</v>

1299
00:33:12.051 --> 00:33:12.621
<v Speaker 2>the little town.</v>

1300
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:13.280

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.291
<v Speaker 2>It's Twitter.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What did you do?</v>

1329
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Because you said he had never gotten in a fist fight that the USC is creating</v>

1330
00:34:06.081 --> 00:34:07.650
<v Speaker 2>pussies that I've never been at this one.</v>

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.420
<v Speaker 2>We have the world's best athletes and like Demetrius,</v>

1334
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:16.430
<v Speaker 2>I doubt he's ever even been in a fist fight in his life,</v>

1335
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.540
<v Speaker 2>but he beat my ass.</v>

1336
00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:19.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1337
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:19.900
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1338
00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.541
<v Speaker 2>that second fight,</v>

1339
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:21.260
<v Speaker 2>he beat me up.</v>

1340
00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:24.710
<v Speaker 2>So I'm just saying that a lot of guys,</v>

1341
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:26.120
<v Speaker 2>they just aren't scary.</v>

1342
00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Like I comment to go from not scary to pussy is a pretty big league mean.</v>

1343
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.440
<v Speaker 2>He's not an animal.</v>

1344
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:36.800
<v Speaker 2>You mean like if some shit goes down on the street he wants to beat the shit out</v>

1345
00:34:36.801 --> 00:34:37.521
<v Speaker 2>of you and then liquids,</v>

1346
00:34:37.521 --> 00:34:38.960
<v Speaker 2>gloves and you know,</v>

1349
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.851
<v Speaker 2>I just kidding.</v>

1350
00:34:43.851 --> 00:34:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm just back in the day.</v>

1351
00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:49.250
<v Speaker 2>But that's who I was raised by,</v>

1352
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:50.031
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1353
00:34:50.031 --> 00:34:53.510
<v Speaker 2>so I have a different outlook on it is this fucking savages and the guys that</v>

1354
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:55.370
<v Speaker 2>are just there to be athletic.</v>

1355
00:34:55.371 --> 00:34:56.750
<v Speaker 2>One of the biggest transitions,</v>

1356
00:34:56.890 --> 00:34:57.351
<v Speaker 2>I'm a deck,</v>

1357
00:34:57.351 --> 00:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

1358
00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1359
00:34:58.161 --> 00:34:59.780
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest transitions in mmm,</v>

1360
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:01.460
<v Speaker 2>well the last 10 years has been,</v>

1361
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 2>it used to be a sport of martial arts and fighters.</v>

1362
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Now the support of athletes and I go,</v>

1363
00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:09.230
<v Speaker 2>these guys are at there just stud athletes who kind of went in that direction.</v>

1364
00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:10.640
<v Speaker 2>They didn't grow up going,</v>

1365
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:11.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1366

1371
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 2>That breed.</v>

1372
00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Those two halves are kind of gone now.</v>

1373

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.900
<v Speaker 3>I used to drink with a mallet pet over it.</v>

1443
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.473
<v Speaker 3>You know how scary it is,</v>

1444
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:18.463
<v Speaker 3>dude?</v>

1445

<v Speaker 3>Holy Jesus.</v>

1446
00:37:19.941 --> 00:37:21.650
<v Speaker 3>It was like you got shot by a gun.</v>

1447
00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:22.550
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

1448
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.383
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1449
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.110
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1450
00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:24.561
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

1451
00:37:24.561 --> 00:37:27.530
<v Speaker 3>I was getting a guy named Kenny Johnson who just cornered actually,</v>

1452
00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:27.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1453
00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:28.430
<v Speaker 3>a wrestler.</v>

1454
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:32.090
<v Speaker 3>I was cornering him for a fight out in orange county somewhere and mallow pet</v>

1455
00:37:32.091 --> 00:37:32.871
<v Speaker 3>was fighting wild man.</v>

1456
00:37:32.871 --> 00:37:35.240
<v Speaker 3>Danny in the main event and King of the cage.</v>

1457
00:37:35.650 --> 00:37:35.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1458
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:36.763
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

1459
00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.360
<v Speaker 3>And we're,</v>

1460
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:38.631
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1461
00:37:38.631 --> 00:37:41.000
<v Speaker 3>they're two separate rooms and in the room next to us,</v>

1462
00:37:41.001 --> 00:37:43.430
<v Speaker 3>it sounded like someone was shooting a rifle off.</v>

1463
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.970
<v Speaker 3>Like literally I got up and I turned and was mallet hitting pads.</v>

1464
00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:47.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1465
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.980

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:51.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1478
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.490
<v Speaker 3>he hit Romy was an elbow like five seconds in just,</v>

1479
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.870
<v Speaker 3>and then all of a sudden started smiling and pointing and then Romy was like</v>

1480
00:38:05.871 --> 00:38:10.580
<v Speaker 3>fucking turn around and just had this giant vagina in the front of his head.</v>

1481
00:38:10.581 --> 00:38:11.414
<v Speaker 3>And it was,</v>

1482
00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:12.680
<v Speaker 3>I saw a fight.</v>

1483
00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.970
<v Speaker 3>It was fucking scary.</v>

1484
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:14.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1485
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.103
<v Speaker 3>he's nasty.</v>

1486
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.190
<v Speaker 3>He's nasty.</v>

1487
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.941
<v Speaker 3>Like super bond.</v>

1488
00:38:16.941 --> 00:38:17.840
<v Speaker 3>And those little tie guys,</v>

1489
00:38:17.841 --> 00:38:18.291
<v Speaker 3>I mean they're,</v>

1490
00:38:18.291 --> 00:38:19.100
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1491
00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.330
<v Speaker 3>they want us to go out there and I'm like,</v>

1492
00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.210
<v Speaker 3>I don't fucking,</v>

1493
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:24.260
<v Speaker 3>then those guys hardly ever spar.</v>

1494
00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.153
<v Speaker 3>They don't talk.</v>

1495
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:26.391
<v Speaker 3>They feel safe.</v>

1496
00:38:26.391 --> 00:38:30.530
<v Speaker 3>They fail 300 times by the time they're 25 which is just absolutely incredible.</v>

1497
00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:31.510
<v Speaker 3>If you've ever been a ton.</v>

1498
00:38:31.511 --> 00:38:33.470
<v Speaker 3>And it's really weird when they have a five round fight,</v>

1499
00:38:33.471 --> 00:38:35.740
<v Speaker 3>they don't fight in the first round because they're feeling each other out.</v>

1500
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:38.500
<v Speaker 4>They kill each other rounds two,</v>

1501
00:38:38.501 --> 00:38:40.480
<v Speaker 4>three and four and they don't fight in the fifth round.</v>

1502
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:41.913
<v Speaker 4>They carry each other.</v>

1503
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.210
<v Speaker 4>And I asked my coaches time,</v>

1504
00:38:43.211 --> 00:38:43.871
<v Speaker 4>I was training Tamika,</v>

1505
00:38:43.871 --> 00:38:44.261
<v Speaker 4>why did they do it?</v>

1506
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

1507
00:38:44.650 --> 00:38:45.520
<v Speaker 4>you fight next week.</v>

1508
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.720
<v Speaker 4>There's no point.</v>

1509
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 4>We already know who won basically on the cards,</v>

1510
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.560
<v Speaker 4>so why would you destroy your body?</v>

1511
00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 4>You got to fight and like a week.</v>

1512
00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:52.150
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

1513
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 4>They just don't give us just a little a fifth round.</v>

1514
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:54.011
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1515
00:38:54.011 --> 00:38:54.221
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1516
00:38:54.221 --> 00:38:54.821
<v Speaker 4>I know you once.</v>

1517
00:38:54.821 --> 00:38:55.550
<v Speaker 4>Let's just,</v>

1518
00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:56.660
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of rambling stuff,</v>

1519
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.670
<v Speaker 4>lot of gambling.</v>

1520
00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.950
<v Speaker 4>That is so interesting that they do that.</v>

1521
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.380
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that tie,</v>

1522
00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:01.960
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1523
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.950
<v Speaker 4>decisions are better?</v>

1524
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.010
<v Speaker 4>They're better at making decisions because that's the big issue in MMA.</v>

1525
00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.260
<v Speaker 4>It's like don't leave it in the hands of the judges,</v>

1526
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:09.900
<v Speaker 4>which I hate to,</v>

1527
00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 4>I hate that expression.</v>

1528
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:11.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1529
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:12.170
<v Speaker 4>We have a,</v>

1530
00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.660
<v Speaker 4>we have one of my least favorite Shitty,</v>

1531
00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:14.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1532
00:39:14.181 --> 00:39:15.014
<v Speaker 4>judging system.</v>

1533
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1534
00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:16.031
<v Speaker 4>we need to change,</v>

1535
00:39:16.031 --> 00:39:17.560
<v Speaker 4>but how are we going to change it and fuck,</v>

1536
00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:17.890
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1537
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:18.191
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1538
00:39:18.191 --> 00:39:20.890
<v Speaker 4>There's so many options and the people have so many ideas and they all seem</v>

1539
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:21.461
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1540
00:39:21.461 --> 00:39:23.080
<v Speaker 4>but there's always holes in them and yeah,</v>

1541
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.740
<v Speaker 4>you get bad decisions in boxing that's been around for a hundred years and you</v>

1542
00:39:26.741 --> 00:39:28.840
<v Speaker 4>have 12 rounds and you get horrible decisions.</v>

1543
00:39:28.841 --> 00:39:32.410
<v Speaker 4>Remember that one woman out there was one woman who was a boxing judge who uh,</v>

1544
00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:34.150
<v Speaker 4>she judged a Bradley.</v>

1545
00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:35.170
<v Speaker 4>We let the over pack.</v>

1546
00:39:35.171 --> 00:39:35.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1547
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.780
<v Speaker 4>I remember she also called the main,</v>

1548
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.220
<v Speaker 4>whether it hurts another one.</v>

1549
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.680
<v Speaker 4>May what the Mayweather,</v>

1550
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.553
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1551
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:42.340
<v Speaker 4>the Mayweather fight,</v>

1552
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:43.270
<v Speaker 4>she called it a draw me.</v>

1553
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.110
<v Speaker 4>Hello?</v>

1554
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:44.630
<v Speaker 4>Hello.</v>

1555
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1556
00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:45.701
<v Speaker 4>And everybody was like,</v>

1557
00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:48.730
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck was so bad that they brought in the Nevada state governor?</v>

1558
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.390
<v Speaker 4>They kicked her out.</v>

1559
00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:49.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1560
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.520
<v Speaker 4>They kicked her out and they brought in the divided state governor.</v>

1561
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:51.841
<v Speaker 4>And the,</v>

1562
00:39:51.841 --> 00:39:55.900
<v Speaker 4>the real concern amongst people in the know was that she might be getting paid</v>

1563
00:39:55.901 --> 00:39:56.800
<v Speaker 4>off by gamblers.</v>

1564
00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.050
<v Speaker 4>That a gambler who,</v>

1565
00:39:58.110 --> 00:39:59.890
<v Speaker 4>who wanted to ensure,</v>

1566
00:39:59.891 --> 00:40:01.930
<v Speaker 4>like if you've got a fight where you know,</v>

1567
00:40:01.931 --> 00:40:04.810
<v Speaker 4>a guy who's going to win by decision like Floyd Mayweather vs Canelo,</v>

1568
00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.170
<v Speaker 4>you could safely bet a lot of money knowing the flow.</v>

1569
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:08.381
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1570
00:40:08.381 --> 00:40:09.280
<v Speaker 4>shit can happen.</v>

1571
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:09.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1572
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.390
<v Speaker 4>Canelo can win,</v>

1573
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.290
<v Speaker 4>but most likely you're going to see Floyd boxes face off most likely.</v>

1574
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:15.190
<v Speaker 4>And that is what happened.</v>

1575
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:17.110
<v Speaker 4>But she didn't see it that way.</v>

1576
00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:21.200
<v Speaker 4>And she makes it a draw and then it's not a majority to sit or now it's on</v>

1577
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:22.330
<v Speaker 4>unanimous decision.</v>

1578
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.300
<v Speaker 4>You could bet against it not being in a unanimous decision.</v>

1579
00:40:25.301 --> 00:40:25.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1580
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.900
<v Speaker 4>Big Vegas Elbow.</v>

1581
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.163
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1582
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:29.111
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

1583
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:29.231
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1584
00:40:29.231 --> 00:40:29.650
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

1585
00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:33.610
<v Speaker 4>Braga versus Hester and Braga does have one fight in the,</v>

1586
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:34.361
<v Speaker 4>or Neto rather.</v>

1587
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:37.330
<v Speaker 4>He does have one fight in the UFC and he's got a,</v>

1588
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:37.991
<v Speaker 4>he's got a victory.</v>

1589
00:40:37.991 --> 00:40:39.700
<v Speaker 4>He fought on the under card.</v>

1590
00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:40.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1591
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.650
<v Speaker 4>I've seen Hester fight.</v>

1592
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:42.640
<v Speaker 4>And this is his style,</v>

1593
00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:45.730
<v Speaker 4>that athletic hands down kind of explosive style,</v>

1594
00:40:45.731 --> 00:40:48.040
<v Speaker 4>but it's getting caught by the left a lot.</v>

1595
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:52.030
<v Speaker 4>Mr It's a BC that they do not look like they're in the same weight class.</v>

1596
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:52.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1597
00:40:52.731 --> 00:40:53.600
<v Speaker 1>He's enormous.</v>

1598
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:55.120
<v Speaker 1>That's cut.</v>

1599
00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:55.491
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

1600
00:40:55.491 --> 00:40:57.430
<v Speaker 1>wait baby cutting that,</v>

1601
00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:57.681
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

1602
00:40:57.681 --> 00:40:58.514
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

1603
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I like seeing are that our new bantamweight champions,</v>

1604
00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:04.894
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1605
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.710
<v Speaker 1>doesn't cut much weight.</v>

1606
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:06.543
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem like he does.</v>

1607
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:07.211
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1608
00:41:07.211 --> 00:41:08.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he cuts wants weight at all.</v>

1609
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Tj.</v>

1610
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.791
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1611
00:41:09.791 --> 00:41:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I think at the most,</v>

1612
00:41:11.130 --> 00:41:12.040
<v Speaker 1>a couple of pounds.</v>

1613
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:12.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1614
00:41:12.401 --> 00:41:13.090
<v Speaker 1>He's a beast.</v>

1615
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's a perfect example of finding the right teacher and the right pupil.</v>

1616
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1617
00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:19.870
<v Speaker 1>him and Dwayne just fucking gel together.</v>

1618
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:21.250
<v Speaker 1>And Dwayne is a,</v>

1619
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:22.360
<v Speaker 1>just a total madman.</v>

1620
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.250
<v Speaker 1>So Neto is a,</v>

1621
00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.840
<v Speaker 1>he's a world champion,</v>

1622
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1623
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:27.281
<v Speaker 1>under,</v>

1624
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:27.790

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:28.630
<v Speaker 1>under Gordo.</v>

1626
00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

1627
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:30.611
<v Speaker 1>does it evolve?</v>

1628
00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:33.950
<v Speaker 1>MMA in Brazil evolves,</v>

1629
00:41:33.951 --> 00:41:34.784
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1630
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.660

1631
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.590
<v Speaker 2>the rich guys.</v>

1632
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:37.453

1634
00:41:38.281 --> 00:41:39.620
<v Speaker 2>And then that's the one in Singapore I think.</v>

1635

<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1636
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.890
<v Speaker 2>I've treated the all in Singapore</v>

1637
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:45.283
<v Speaker 2>when we were out.</v>

1638
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1639
00:41:45.481 --> 00:41:45.810
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1640
00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Chattery dancing classes.</v>

1641
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.230
<v Speaker 2>You'll dogs sit the Diane,</v>

1643
00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.900
<v Speaker 1>All these rich rich dudes are doing that.</v>

1644
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Like these crazy guys like Dan Lambert from American top team and the guy that</v>

1645
00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.051
<v Speaker 1>did it over it,</v>

1646
00:41:58.051 --> 00:41:59.040
<v Speaker 1>a black zillions.</v>

1647
00:41:59.041 --> 00:42:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I loved these guys are doing that and they're the same thing.</v>

1648
00:42:01.861 --> 00:42:04.110
<v Speaker 1>He would Texas to teen takedown.</v>

1649
00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1650
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You know all of the wrestlers.</v>

1651
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1652
00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Those motherfuckers,</v>

1653
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:08.850
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1654
00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:09.780
<v Speaker 1>those guys get paid.</v>

1655
00:42:09.781 --> 00:42:10.860
<v Speaker 1>They get like a salary.</v>

1656
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.360
<v Speaker 1>You get these rich dudes that nice fine animals like Johnny Hendricks.</v>

1657
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:16.740
<v Speaker 1>They find these fucking animals.</v>

1658
00:42:16.741 --> 00:42:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Give them a world class facility,</v>

1659
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.800
<v Speaker 1>hire world class coaches,</v>

1660
00:42:19.801 --> 00:42:22.560
<v Speaker 1>guys like mark layman to go out there and teach them Jujitsu.</v>

1661
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Great striking coaches and wrestling coaches and just build world champions.</v>

1662
00:42:26.221 --> 00:42:27.054
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

1663
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:28.350
<v Speaker 1>they have a weird deal too,</v>

1664
00:42:28.351 --> 00:42:29.340
<v Speaker 1>like the word,</v>

1665
00:42:29.341 --> 00:42:32.010
<v Speaker 1>like they give up like 50% of their purse to the gym.</v>

1666
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Like the gym pays for everything,</v>

1667
00:42:34.501 --> 00:42:35.580
<v Speaker 1>gives them a salary,</v>

1668
00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:36.414
<v Speaker 1>takes care of everything.</v>

1669
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.310
<v Speaker 1>But then they get a,</v>

1670
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:39.260
<v Speaker 1>the gym gets a big cut of their,</v>

1671
00:42:39.261 --> 00:42:39.890
<v Speaker 1>they're winning.</v>

1672
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Now I want to bring up something that we're in the right,</v>

1673
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:46.280
<v Speaker 2>well we have the right peoples slick this guy and he's putting pressure on,</v>

1674
00:42:46.281 --> 00:42:47.010
<v Speaker 2>it's not letting him up.</v>

1675
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:47.843
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1676
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:48.990
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

1677
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.761
<v Speaker 2>that system,</v>

1678
00:42:49.761 --> 00:42:50.541
<v Speaker 2>that situation.</v>

1679
00:42:50.541 --> 00:42:53.300
<v Speaker 2>There's a fighter that will remain nameless and we were like,</v>

1680
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:56.000
<v Speaker 2>he had kind of plateaued and we said,</v>

1681
00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:56.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1682
00:42:56.151 --> 00:42:56.570
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

1683
00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:57.201
<v Speaker 2>you should move on.</v>

1684
00:42:57.201 --> 00:42:58.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't think your Jim's doing it right for you.</v>

1685
00:42:58.491 --> 00:42:58.761
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1686
00:42:58.761 --> 00:42:59.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1687
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I'm just as a friend and he went,</v>

1688
00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:02.690
<v Speaker 2>they're paying me a salary.</v>

1689
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I really can't leave.</v>

1690
00:43:03.621 --> 00:43:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1691
00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

1692
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:04.701
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1693
00:43:04.701 --> 00:43:06.230
<v Speaker 2>I can't afford to walk away.</v>

1694
00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.680
<v Speaker 2>They're paying me too much to leave and find the right gym.</v>

1695
00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:10.821
<v Speaker 2>And it was interesting.</v>

1696
00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:11.150
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1697
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah man.</v>

1698
00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 2>That system where it's,</v>

1699
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:13.471
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1700
00:43:13.471 --> 00:43:13.600
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1701
00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:17.090
<v Speaker 2>if you're not fighting for your purse and a guy's paying you a salary,</v>

1702
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.220
<v Speaker 2>but you're not getting the train you need,</v>

1703
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 2>could he keep you somewhere?</v>

1704
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:21.141
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>

1705
00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe the downside of that kind of system,</v>

1706
00:43:22.821 --> 00:43:23.600
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of tied to it.</v>

1707
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1708
00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:27.560
<v Speaker 1>That could be the downside to that system if the guy's not fully committed to,</v>

1709
00:43:27.610 --> 00:43:28.510
<v Speaker 1>to his athletes.</v>

1710
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1711
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1712
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an all in sort of a proposition.</v>

1713
00:43:31.091 --> 00:43:32.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to start that kind of a big gym,</v>

1714
00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:33.431
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

1715
00:43:33.431 --> 00:43:34.900
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be fully committed to your,</v>

1716
00:43:34.901 --> 00:43:35.650
<v Speaker 1>it's your athletes</v>

1717
00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.060
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to pay for whatever they want,</v>

1718
00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever coach they want.</v>

1719
00:43:38.291 --> 00:43:39.220
<v Speaker 2>If it's someone's not good enough,</v>

1720
00:43:39.221 --> 00:43:39.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to say it.</v>

1721
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1722
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.010
<v Speaker 2>If I'm beating up one of my coaches,</v>

1723
00:43:42.011 --> 00:43:42.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be like,</v>

1724
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:43.090
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

1725
00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:43.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

1726
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what happened with Kenny Monday.</v>

1727
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:46.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1728
00:43:46.361 --> 00:43:46.731
<v Speaker 2>cause he,</v>

1729
00:43:46.731 --> 00:43:48.160
<v Speaker 2>when he left the black Zillions,</v>

1730
00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:48.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1731
00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't get a better wrestling coach in that guy there.</v>

1732
00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.613
<v Speaker 2>They fired him.</v>

1733
00:43:53.590 --> 00:43:54.131
<v Speaker 2>Well this fight,</v>

1734
00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.660
<v Speaker 2>this is the kind of pressure we were talking about,</v>

1735
00:43:55.661 --> 00:43:55.841
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>

1736
00:43:55.841 --> 00:43:57.260
<v Speaker 2>that you don't see a whole lot in MMA.</v>

1737
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:58.990
<v Speaker 2>He's got really good positioning,</v>

1738
00:43:58.991 --> 00:43:59.824
<v Speaker 2>really good pressure.</v>

1739
00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.360
<v Speaker 2>He looked to the referee.</v>

1740
00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:01.990
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1741
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.490
<v Speaker 2>that's shit is getting annoying.</v>

1742
00:44:03.491 --> 00:44:06.000
<v Speaker 2>That looking through the referee to come meet him.</v>

1743
00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:06.711
<v Speaker 2>He's out.</v>

1744
00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:07.301
<v Speaker 2>He's out.</v>

1745
00:44:07.301 --> 00:44:07.871
<v Speaker 2>He's out.</v>

1746
00:44:07.871 --> 00:44:08.700
<v Speaker 2>That's my favorite.</v>

1747
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1748
00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:09.870
<v Speaker 2>the guys and the good.</v>

1749
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.070
<v Speaker 2>And you're saying he's out and they stopped the fight and he's awake.</v>

1750
00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.383
<v Speaker 2>That's off.</v>

1751
00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:17.160
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember that Yoshida Hoists Gracie fight where he pretended that hoist</v>

1752
00:44:17.161 --> 00:44:17.520
<v Speaker 2>was out?</v>

1753
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:18.353
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1754
00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.050
<v Speaker 2>And Noyce was fine.</v>

1755
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Mack Danzig versus uh,</v>

1756
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.840
<v Speaker 2>who got him into QT.</v>

1757
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Matt Wyman and cities.</v>

1758
00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:25.113
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1759
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.033
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1760
00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1761
00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:28.870
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't out at all.</v>

1762
00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.273
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1763
00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.660
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1764
00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:32.190
<v Speaker 2>but that's</v>

1765
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.300
<v Speaker 4>easy to tell though.</v>

1766
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 4>A graph or that's easy to tell if a guy's out.</v>

1767
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:37.260
<v Speaker 4>That's unexcusable.</v>

1768
00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:39.210
<v Speaker 4>That's an uneducated judge.</v>

1769
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.870
<v Speaker 4>Kaye o's are weird like earlier today.</v>

1770
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:43.430
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1771
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:44.050
<v Speaker 4>oh no.</v>

1772
00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:44.883
<v Speaker 4>On the old,</v>

1773
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:45.810
<v Speaker 4>a nice arm trap.</v>

1774
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:49.950
<v Speaker 4>I love seeing good Jujitsu and MMA.</v>

1775
00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:50.490
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

1776
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:51.323
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Bedford,</v>

1777
00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:52.560
<v Speaker 4>pretty heavy.</v>

1778
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:53.161
<v Speaker 4>Heavy hips,</v>

1779
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:53.430
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1780
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Johnny Bedford got fucked over earlier today for that.</v>

1781
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.480
<v Speaker 4>He got nailed with a punch.</v>

1782
00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.060
<v Speaker 4>Went down and you know he got rocked.</v>

1783
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.630
<v Speaker 4>It got,</v>

1784
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:04.620
<v Speaker 4>but the referee stopped the fight and immediately and you know he got up like</v>

1785
00:45:04.621 --> 00:45:05.560
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1786
00:45:05.561 --> 00:45:06.690
<v Speaker 4>Screaming and yelling.</v>

1787
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:07.524
<v Speaker 4>This is bullshit.</v>

1788
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.030
<v Speaker 4>Clearly not wobbly.</v>

1789
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:09.910
<v Speaker 4>Told him,</v>

1790
00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:10.953
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1791
00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:11.641
<v Speaker 4>don't touch him,</v>

1792
00:45:11.641 --> 00:45:12.474
<v Speaker 4>don't us.</v>

1793
00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:13.920
<v Speaker 4>Don't push.</v>

1794
00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.400
<v Speaker 4>We're talking.</v>

1795
00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.980
<v Speaker 4>The reason why we're saying that is fucking Jason High Man,</v>

1796
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:18.150
<v Speaker 4>Baby Push.</v>

1797
00:45:18.151 --> 00:45:21.120
<v Speaker 4>It was nothing freaking out that the fight got stopped.</v>

1798
00:45:21.121 --> 00:45:22.290
<v Speaker 4>He freaks out in the moment.</v>

1799
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:23.550
<v Speaker 4>Touches the referee,</v>

1800
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 4>banned for life from the UFC and suspended for a year,</v>

1801
00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:28.560
<v Speaker 4>which I disagree with it.</v>

1802
00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:30.690
<v Speaker 4>I think the referee,</v>

1803
00:45:30.691 --> 00:45:33.840
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing you think of Ronda Rousey pushed the referee.</v>

1804
00:45:33.841 --> 00:45:37.430
<v Speaker 4>They would have that same reaction as what are the risks?</v>

1805
00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.820
<v Speaker 4>What if Rhonda Rousey lost?</v>

1806
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:39.450
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1807
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:39.751
<v Speaker 4>what if,</v>

1808
00:45:39.751 --> 00:45:41.360
<v Speaker 4>let's say some crazy shit happened.</v>

1809
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.290
<v Speaker 4>Some Liz Carmouche style.</v>

1810
00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:45.330
<v Speaker 4>Remember when Liz had run his back would,</v>

1811
00:45:45.331 --> 00:45:48.540
<v Speaker 4>if someone sinks that in and really fucking locks it up and clamps it down and</v>

1812
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:52.530
<v Speaker 4>Rhonda goes out or rotted taps or the referee thinks that Ron has got a tap and</v>

1813
00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 4>the referee stopped the fight and then Ronnie fucking freaks out and pushes the</v>

1814
00:45:56.281 --> 00:45:57.114
<v Speaker 4>referee,</v>

1815
00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.043
<v Speaker 4>what would happen?</v>

1816
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Would it be the same because it's a woman doing it?</v>

1817
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:01.051
<v Speaker 4>Would it be,</v>

1818
00:46:01.051 --> 00:46:01.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1819
00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Jason,</v>

1820
00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:02.790
<v Speaker 4>I didn't hurt anybody.</v>

1821
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.540
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1822
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.800
<v Speaker 4>it has nothing to do with being a woman.</v>

1823
00:46:04.801 --> 00:46:08.760
<v Speaker 4>And then I see the point of zero tolerance.</v>

1824
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:09.241
<v Speaker 4>Don't push.</v>

1825
00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:10.074
<v Speaker 4>Don't touch the restroom.</v>

1826
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.140
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

1827
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.941
<v Speaker 4>I totally do too,</v>

1828
00:46:11.941 --> 00:46:15.210
<v Speaker 4>but I totally get your point as to if Rhonda did that,</v>

1829
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:16.230
<v Speaker 4>would they have the same reaction?</v>

1830
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:17.730
<v Speaker 4>Find Him.</v>

1831
00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.200
<v Speaker 4>Find him $1,000.</v>

1832
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.830
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

1833
00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.210
<v Speaker 4>that sounds right to me.</v>

1834
00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:21.810
<v Speaker 4>I think it's,</v>

1835
00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:23.760
<v Speaker 4>they took 19 hundreds and a year.</v>

1836
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:24.810
<v Speaker 4>They took 10% well,</v>

1837
00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 4>the 10% is a good amount.</v>

1838
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:27.773
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

1839
00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:29.100
<v Speaker 4>Don't do that.</v>

1840
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:30.330
<v Speaker 4>Don't touch the referee now.</v>

1841
00:46:30.331 --> 00:46:31.920
<v Speaker 4>You know the referee fucked up.</v>

1842
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:32.580
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1843
00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.350
<v Speaker 4>but it was pretty God damn clothes.</v>

1844
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:35.333
<v Speaker 4>You got hurt.</v>

1845
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:36.540
<v Speaker 4>He got hurt pretty bad.</v>

1846
00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.620
<v Speaker 4>Don't touch the referee,</v>

1847
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.940
<v Speaker 4>but God damn it.</v>

1848
00:46:38.941 --> 00:46:39.640
<v Speaker 4>You don't,</v>

1849
00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:40.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1850
00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:40.361
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

1851
00:46:40.361 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 4>I think Jason has a good guy.</v>

1852
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.290
<v Speaker 4>I've known him,</v>

1853
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:43.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1854
00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:43.981
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1855
00:46:43.981 --> 00:46:44.281
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>

1856
00:46:44.281 --> 00:46:45.180
<v Speaker 4>I've talked to him,</v>

1857
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:46.230
<v Speaker 4>I think he's a good guy.</v>

1858
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.400
<v Speaker 4>I liked the way he fights.</v>

1859
00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:48.630
<v Speaker 4>He's a good fighter.</v>

1860
00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.540
<v Speaker 4>It sucks to me to see a guy like that get banned.</v>

1861
00:46:51.541 --> 00:46:52.020
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1862
00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.730
<v Speaker 4>but I see it on from their point of view.</v>

1863
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.910
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

1864
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:54.121
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1865
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:57.750
<v Speaker 4>you've got to set a zero tolerance policy to any shenanigans.</v>

1866
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.531
<v Speaker 4>That's why,</v>

1867
00:46:58.531 --> 00:46:59.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1868
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.200
<v Speaker 4>look at Semtex Paul Daley.</v>

1869
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.790
<v Speaker 4>So fucking bad.</v>

1870
00:47:02.791 --> 00:47:06.570
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker like one of the best at one 71 of the most exciting guys to watch,</v>

1871
00:47:06.571 --> 00:47:07.150
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>

1872
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:10.770
<v Speaker 4>Took a fucking sucker punch at Josh Koscheck and he's been gone ever since.</v>

1873
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:12.900
<v Speaker 4>And Dag Dan [inaudible] on a sucker.</v>

1874
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:14.760
<v Speaker 4>If I hit him up like a toy dude,</v>

1875
00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:16.890
<v Speaker 4>I'll never forget that night.</v>

1876
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:17.650
<v Speaker 4>Like principal,</v>

1877
00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.820
<v Speaker 4>you'd pick up a dog that bit you like a pug and what?</v>

1878

<v Speaker 4>God Damn it and like shook him.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Know that.</v>

1880
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.120
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1881
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:26.610
<v Speaker 4>Has it been big giant man,</v>

1882
00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:28.440
<v Speaker 4>big boy and a very nice guy too.</v>

1883
00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:29.140
<v Speaker 4>He's a great,</v>

1884
00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:30.540
<v Speaker 4>like Dan [inaudible].</v>

1885
00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.490
<v Speaker 4>He used to get a a hard time from a lot of people because he was one of the</v>

1886
00:47:33.491 --> 00:47:38.491
<v Speaker 4>original referees for elite Xc and elite Xc had some dog shit rules.</v>

1887
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:43.210
<v Speaker 4>They were trying to stand people up after 15 seconds like Jake shields cut</v>

1888
00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:46.480
<v Speaker 4>Semtex and elite ECC with an arm bar and it was like he was,</v>

1889
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:50.080
<v Speaker 4>he was running to get that arm bar before they stood him up.</v>

1890
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.210
<v Speaker 4>If you were a grappler in elite x,</v>

1891
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:52.810
<v Speaker 4>Z,</v>

1892
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:53.111
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

1893
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:54.940
<v Speaker 4>you were at a fucking bad place.</v>

1894
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.410
<v Speaker 4>You were in a big country,</v>

1895
00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 4>had Andre Arlovski on the ground inside control,</v>

1896
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:03.190
<v Speaker 4>double wrist lock working the Komora and they stand them up and you're like,</v>

1897
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:04.000
<v Speaker 4>why?</v>

1898
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.481
<v Speaker 4>I remember that.</v>

1899
00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.670
<v Speaker 4>I can side control the Camorra.</v>

1900
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:07.721
<v Speaker 4>Stand them up,</v>

1901
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:08.410
<v Speaker 4>stand them up.</v>

1902
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.280
<v Speaker 4>That fat fuck.</v>

1903
00:48:09.281 --> 00:48:10.240
<v Speaker 4>Who was that fucking guy?</v>

1904
00:48:10.241 --> 00:48:11.074
<v Speaker 4>That promoter?</v>

1905
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.860
<v Speaker 4>That's sloppy Jello face.</v>

1906
00:48:12.930 --> 00:48:13.763
<v Speaker 4>Motherfucker.</v>

1907
00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:18.010
<v Speaker 4>Don't even say his name and he's like,</v>

1908
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:18.501
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>

1909
00:48:18.501 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 4>he's Candyman.</v>

1910
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.103
<v Speaker 4>He'll show up.</v>

1911
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh that fucking gross person.</v>

1912
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.730
<v Speaker 4>Those guys ruined MMA for a while and they got on show the gun on CBS with that</v>

1913
00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

1914
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:29.590
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing how far they got with it.</v>

1915
00:48:29.591 --> 00:48:33.370
<v Speaker 4>When you think about it so far as idiots so far.</v>

1916
00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.270
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

1917
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:35.320
<v Speaker 4>we're watching an awesome fight.</v>

1918
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Soaps coming back in the second row there in the second round and Braga extended</v>

1919
00:48:41.321 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 4>a lot of energy trying to get Hester to the ground and try to submit them,</v>

1920
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:45.130
<v Speaker 4>but couldn't submit him.</v>

1921
00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.510
<v Speaker 4>And now Hester stuffs that takedown.</v>

1922
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.460
<v Speaker 4>Super easy.</v>

1923
00:48:49.690 --> 00:48:49.990
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1924
00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:51.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a big athletic person.</v>

1925
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:51.934
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

1926
00:48:51.990 --> 00:48:52.823
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

1927
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.880
<v Speaker 4>look at this as to take him down.</v>

1928
00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:55.900
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful.</v>

1929
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:57.023
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1930
00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:57.981
<v Speaker 4>we'll see how it's not.</v>

1931
00:48:57.981 --> 00:48:59.610
<v Speaker 4>It seems like probably a bad idea.</v>

1932
00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.570
<v Speaker 4>Look at that deep half both legs locked up.</v>

1933
00:49:01.930 --> 00:49:03.310
<v Speaker 4>That's sweet.</v>

1937
00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.280
<v Speaker 4>Both legs locked up in the deep half.</v>

1938
00:49:09.281 --> 00:49:10.270
<v Speaker 4>You're in fucking trouble,</v>

1939
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:10.481
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1940
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:11.920
<v Speaker 4>You've got to explode to get out of that.</v>

1941
00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Is this nettle full mountain now?</v>

1942
00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:17.830
<v Speaker 4>That was gorgeous.</v>

1943
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:19.450
<v Speaker 4>I love seeing shit like that.</v>

00:49:19.451 --> 00:49:20.170
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>

1945
00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:21.070
<v Speaker 4>I don't see enough of it.</v>

1946
00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.070
<v Speaker 4>You don't mean you got like jock array.</v>

1947
00:49:24.071 --> 00:49:25.150
<v Speaker 4>Damien Maia,</v>

1948
00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:25.811
<v Speaker 4>this guy.</v>

1949
00:49:25.811 --> 00:49:28.360
<v Speaker 4>You've got like a few worldclass guys.</v>

1950
00:49:28.361 --> 00:49:30.850
<v Speaker 4>If y'all know Fernandez one the best for sure.</v>

1951
00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:32.860
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

1952
00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.450
<v Speaker 4>Few worldclass guys,</v>

1953
00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:37.023
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

1954
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:37.691
<v Speaker 4>it has to.</v>

1955
00:49:37.691 --> 00:49:38.980
<v Speaker 4>It has got to be bummed out.</v>

1956
00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.300
<v Speaker 4>He now he's all gift wrapped.</v>

1957
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:44.290
<v Speaker 4>That's a sucky spot and he's doing that thing where you stick your thumb inside</v>

1958
00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:44.770
<v Speaker 4>the glove.</v>

1959
00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:44.981
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

1960
00:49:44.981 --> 00:49:46.240
<v Speaker 4>right in front of everybody.</v>

1961
00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:48.401
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1962
00:49:48.401 --> 00:49:49.330
<v Speaker 4>We can see you right.</v>

1963
00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.250
<v Speaker 4>He was barely doing it though.</v>

1964
00:49:51.251 --> 00:49:52.084
<v Speaker 4>His defense.</v>

1965
00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:54.070
<v Speaker 4>But you can use your own gloves.</v>

1966
00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.630
<v Speaker 4>You know who uses his own God?</v>

1967
00:49:55.631 --> 00:49:57.160
<v Speaker 4>Josh Thomson does that real well.</v>

1968
00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:01.390
<v Speaker 4>He'll get like a rear naked or a gay teen and get his hands deep in his own</v>

1969
00:50:01.391 --> 00:50:01.661
<v Speaker 4>glove.</v>

1970
00:50:01.661 --> 00:50:02.200
<v Speaker 4>That's nice.</v>

1971
00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.840
<v Speaker 4>That's a nice grip and I let,</v>

1972
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 4>I guess you're at least,</v>

1973
00:50:05.051 --> 00:50:08.080
<v Speaker 4>you used to be allowed to do that with your gloves,</v>

1974
00:50:08.290 --> 00:50:09.760
<v Speaker 4>but you can't do it with your opponents gloves.</v>

1975
00:50:09.761 --> 00:50:11.840
<v Speaker 4>Just sort of like you can grab your shorts,</v>

1976
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:15.660
<v Speaker 4>can't grab the other guy shorts to protect you like a Kamora like ims Cotita.</v>

1977
00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.320
<v Speaker 4>He did that for like 20 minutes</v>

1978
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:20.890
<v Speaker 4>for the old school fence.</v>

1979
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:22.600
<v Speaker 4>Old School son.</v>

1980
00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:24.910
<v Speaker 4>I was there for the original guy,</v>

1981
00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:25.960
<v Speaker 4>Metzger Tito fight.</v>

1982
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:30.050
<v Speaker 4>We're guy Metsker getting fucked up in Hamilton and they checked him for cuts.</v>

1983
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:32.660
<v Speaker 4>They go back in Toledo shoots and guy caught him in a good team.</v>

1984
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:36.470
<v Speaker 4>I had a fight last season where a guy had his,</v>

1985
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.830
<v Speaker 4>was back mounted through a headbutt backwards.</v>

1986
00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:42.230
<v Speaker 4>I saw that point and they stood him up.</v>

1987
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.190
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous.</v>

1988
00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:43.851
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

1989
00:50:43.851 --> 00:50:45.500
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is this?</v>

1990
00:50:45.501 --> 00:50:46.071
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous?</v>

1991
00:50:46.071 --> 00:50:47.540
<v Speaker 4>And I was so glad that you did.</v>

1992
00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:49.860
<v Speaker 4>I would have been a dude.</v>

1993
00:50:49.861 --> 00:50:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Stick it out of that.</v>

1994
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:51.890
<v Speaker 4>I'll take a point away.</v>

1998
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.160
<v Speaker 4>I was furious that you do commentary like that.</v>

1999
00:50:57.161 --> 00:51:00.260
<v Speaker 4>Do you call guys out on that and you don't just let that shit go.</v>

2000
00:51:00.261 --> 00:51:01.550
<v Speaker 4>I love that you do that.</v>

2001
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:02.670
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait.</v>

2002
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:03.590
<v Speaker 4>Of course you can't look at this.</v>

2003
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:04.280
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.260
<v Speaker 4>because he knows how much to commit to it and a lot of guys don't because you</v>

2015
00:51:15.261 --> 00:51:16.180
<v Speaker 4>don't come off from half courts.</v>

2016
00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:16.580
<v Speaker 4>Tough.</v>

2017
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.150
<v Speaker 4>It's tough.</v>

2018
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:18.410
<v Speaker 4>Especially the guys got a good half guard.</v>

2019
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Unless you like knowing where to put a character in one of those big country</v>

2020
00:51:22.221 --> 00:51:23.360
<v Speaker 4>strong motherfuckers.</v>

2021
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:24.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2022
00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.270
<v Speaker 4>Matt Hughes could just Yank that shit off your body,</v>

2023
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.230
<v Speaker 4>but it's also the hip thing.</v>

2024
00:51:27.231 --> 00:51:30.080
<v Speaker 4>You have to have know how high you have to be up with your hips and lot of guys</v>

2025
00:51:30.081 --> 00:51:30.914
<v Speaker 4>just don't know.</v>

2026
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.640
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

2027
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2028
00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2029
00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:35.120
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting that the level of Jujitsu,</v>

2030
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.640
<v Speaker 4>but it's also interesting level striking and MMA.</v>

2031
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.880
<v Speaker 4>The problem within the May is that there's so much to learn.</v>

2032
00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.670
<v Speaker 4>If you're an athlete and you're getting into MMA,</v>

2033
00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.690
<v Speaker 4>see like a lot of these guys,</v>

2034
00:51:44.691 --> 00:51:46.970
<v Speaker 4>like maybe in your thirties and the MMA,</v>

2035
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.021
<v Speaker 4>God damn,</v>

2036
00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:48.980
<v Speaker 4>there's a learning curve.</v>

2037
00:51:49.010 --> 00:51:50.300
<v Speaker 4>There's so much to learn.</v>

2038
00:51:50.301 --> 00:51:55.130
<v Speaker 4>There's so much to this sport that you're seeing sort of like you don't see</v>

2039
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:58.130
<v Speaker 4>class anything in most fighters.</v>

2040
00:51:58.131 --> 00:52:00.260
<v Speaker 4>You see they're really good at a couple of things.</v>

2041
00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:03.170
<v Speaker 4>But when you see a guy who's worldclass like as like an ardent,</v>

2042
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.880
<v Speaker 4>if art and 11 started fighting in MMA,</v>

2043
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:06.230
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2044
00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.590
<v Speaker 4>The big thing would be talking about this guy striking for sure because he's</v>

2045
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:11.570
<v Speaker 4>world class as a kickboxer.</v>

2046
00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:15.590
<v Speaker 4>And if you'd compare his striking to most guys in MMA,</v>

2047
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2048
00:52:16.161 --> 00:52:18.710
<v Speaker 4>outside of the guys who really stand out,</v>

2049
00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2050
00:52:19.161 --> 00:52:19.491
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

2051
00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 4>well that's just some,</v>

2052
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.310
<v Speaker 4>that's that's what it really should look like.</v>

2053
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:23.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2054
00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:28.010
<v Speaker 4>But for every fighter of a particular discipline that goes into MMA with a ton</v>

2055
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:28.844
<v Speaker 4>of credentials,</v>

2056
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:30.080
<v Speaker 4>who you got as a blue chip,</v>

2057
00:52:30.081 --> 00:52:31.190
<v Speaker 4>this guy's got to do well,</v>

2058
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:32.570
<v Speaker 4>I can point out somebody who,</v>

2059
00:52:32.750 --> 00:52:33.920
<v Speaker 4>same thing tanked.</v>

2060
00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>

2061
00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:36.650
<v Speaker 4>You just can't tell anymore where Intel,</v>

2062
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.510
<v Speaker 4>where guys come in with a background in something you think,</v>

2063
00:52:38.511 --> 00:52:38.691
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2064
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:41.390
<v Speaker 4>this guy's got to be a beast and it just doesn't work out.</v>

2065
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:42.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2066
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:47.370
<v Speaker 4>I hear they all third round Hester probably down two rounds if you,</v>

2067
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:49.070
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2068
00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:49.780
<v Speaker 4>we barely,</v>

2069
00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean we really shouldn't be scoring in here cause we're not really paying</v>

2070
00:52:53.271 --> 00:52:53.630
<v Speaker 4>attention.</v>

2071
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:54.031
<v Speaker 4>Oh Nice.</v>

2072
00:52:54.031 --> 00:52:54.490
<v Speaker 4>Straight ones.</v>

2073
00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:56.060
<v Speaker 4>Hester is going after him here.</v>

2074
00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:57.500
<v Speaker 4>Big Shot to the body</v>

2075
00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:00.740
<v Speaker 4>and Neto got tagged.</v>

2076
00:53:00.830 --> 00:53:02.390
<v Speaker 4>Oh officers tagging him.</v>

2077
00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:04.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

2078
00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.013
<v Speaker 4>he's</v>

2079
00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:08.930
<v Speaker 4>so crazy.</v>

2080
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:10.840
<v Speaker 4>He was fucking him up chest.</v>

2081
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:12.620
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about and you're athletic,</v>

2082
00:53:12.621 --> 00:53:13.520
<v Speaker 4>you're physical,</v>

2083
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:14.271
<v Speaker 4>powerful,</v>

2084
00:53:14.271 --> 00:53:15.440
<v Speaker 4>but don't have your feet under you.</v>

2085
00:53:15.441 --> 00:53:16.190
<v Speaker 4>It's not going to help you.</v>

2086
00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:16.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2087
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.220
<v Speaker 4>And all he's doing on the bottom is surviving.</v>

2088
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.641
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2089
00:53:19.641 --> 00:53:20.990
<v Speaker 4>he's not getting up to his feet.</v>

2090
00:53:20.991 --> 00:53:22.100
<v Speaker 4>He's not escaping.</v>

2091
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.870
<v Speaker 4>He's not,</v>

2092
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:23.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2093
00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 4>he got him down once with that beautiful hip toss,</v>

2094
00:53:26.221 --> 00:53:27.330
<v Speaker 4>but then what happened?</v>

2095
00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.070
<v Speaker 4>You got slapped half swept.</v>

2096
00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.380
<v Speaker 4>That's a beautiful deep half sweep to,</v>

2097
00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:32.610
<v Speaker 4>I want to see that more often.</v>

2098
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:36.000
<v Speaker 4>It's probably pretty tough to get both legs trapped in there like that.</v>

2099
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:38.040
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those weird situations like,</v>

2100
00:53:38.041 --> 00:53:38.550
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2101
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 4>when uh,</v>

2102
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.650
<v Speaker 4>Benevidez fought Tim Elliot and had both his arms trap in the Guillotine,</v>

2103
00:53:43.651 --> 00:53:44.370
<v Speaker 4>so he had a tablet.</v>

2104
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:44.840
<v Speaker 4>It's feet.</v>

2105
00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:45.351
<v Speaker 4>It was crazy.</v>

2106
00:53:45.351 --> 00:53:45.600
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2107
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:45.781
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2108
00:53:45.781 --> 00:53:46.321
<v Speaker 4>it's beautiful.</v>

2109
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Transition to the Mount Neto is just so slick</v>

2110
00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.990
<v Speaker 4>at Saks when someone does that to you.</v>

2111
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.573
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2112
00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:55.311
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2113
00:53:55.311 --> 00:53:56.420
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen that,</v>

2114
00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:57.440
<v Speaker 4>that sort of,</v>

2115
00:53:57.441 --> 00:53:57.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2116
00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:59.270
<v Speaker 4>that position where it guys,</v>

2117
00:53:59.290 --> 00:54:01.550
<v Speaker 4>both arms are trapped and he's getting guillotined</v>

2118
00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:04.450
<v Speaker 4>now's got sick mountain.</v>

2119
00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.653
<v Speaker 4>It happens.</v>

2120
00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.050
<v Speaker 4>It can happen a lot when guys go underneath both ways for the past,</v>

2121
00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:11.400
<v Speaker 4>especially with the [inaudible] that choke over the,</v>

2122
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:13.070
<v Speaker 4>the front kron Gracie does it all the time.</v>

2123
00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:13.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2124
00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:14.480
<v Speaker 4>it's a pain.</v>

2125
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.830
<v Speaker 4>The key is a whole new world.</v>

2126
00:54:15.831 --> 00:54:16.850
<v Speaker 4>Jeff Glover likes that too.</v>

2127
00:54:16.851 --> 00:54:18.860
<v Speaker 4>He'll sit back when you try and pass on eighth his legs,</v>

2128
00:54:18.861 --> 00:54:19.750
<v Speaker 4>he'll sit back and give it to you.</v>

2129
00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:20.810
<v Speaker 4>I'll hop right over your back.</v>

2130
00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:22.183
<v Speaker 4>But that's his thing.</v>

2131
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:23.600
<v Speaker 4>You don't see it a lot in a moment.</v>

2132
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.130
<v Speaker 4>He's a master.</v>

2133
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:26.360
<v Speaker 4>He really is.</v>

2134
00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.170
<v Speaker 4>Glover is a master and kids would be so good at Jujitsu.</v>

2135
00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:31.081
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2136
00:54:31.081 --> 00:54:31.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2137
00:54:31.431 --> 00:54:34.940
<v Speaker 4>he's doing something that Mitch Clark just started doing that.</v>

2138
00:54:34.941 --> 00:54:35.540
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2139
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.040
<v Speaker 4>he'll like let you pass into a Darce.</v>

2140
00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Glover was like one of the first guys I ever saw do that.</v>

2141
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:44.750
<v Speaker 4>And now Mitch Clark was the first guy to ever pull that off in the UFC on ally</v>

2142
00:54:44.751 --> 00:54:45.290
<v Speaker 4>Quinta.</v>

2143
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:45.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2144
00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:46.790
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful submission.</v>

2145
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Like let go to let and he's passing as he's passing.</v>

2146
00:54:50.811 --> 00:54:51.770
<v Speaker 4>He thinks he's getting signed.</v>

2147
00:54:51.771 --> 00:54:53.930
<v Speaker 4>Controlled falls right into a locked up.</v>

2148
00:54:53.931 --> 00:54:54.764
<v Speaker 4>Doris,</v>

2149
00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:57.420
<v Speaker 4>you gotta have a lot of confidence in your darts to pull that off though.</v>

2150
00:54:57.430 --> 00:54:58.263
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2151
00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:58.611
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2152
00:54:58.611 --> 00:54:59.444
<v Speaker 4>It's gotta be strong.</v>

2153
00:54:59.450 --> 00:55:00.500
<v Speaker 4>You've got to have wrong,</v>

2154
00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:01.423
<v Speaker 4>like good.</v>

2155
00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.310
<v Speaker 4>You got to know that that Shit's money.</v>

2156
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2157
00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.500
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

2158
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.490
<v Speaker 4>Clint tagged him.</v>

2159
00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:12.800
<v Speaker 4>Hester had him really badly hurt at the beginning of this round man and now he's</v>

2160
00:55:12.801 --> 00:55:14.150
<v Speaker 4>on top in the guard.</v>

2161
00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.470
<v Speaker 4>He might be able to finish this fight if he could tag this to it a few times</v>

2162
00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:20.510
<v Speaker 4>when he doesn't seem like he would,</v>

2163
00:55:20.511 --> 00:55:21.141
<v Speaker 4>that kind of frame.</v>

2164
00:55:21.141 --> 00:55:21.974
<v Speaker 4>He hasn't gassed.</v>

2165
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:22.893
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2166
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:23.900
<v Speaker 4>Well he's,</v>

2167
00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:26.300
<v Speaker 4>he's real cognizant about pacing himself.</v>

2168
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:26.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2169
00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:31.070
<v Speaker 4>he actually talked about it recently that there was a time where he was fighting</v>

2170
00:55:31.071 --> 00:55:35.420
<v Speaker 4>and he was tagging the guy and I was saying he probably be best served to back</v>

2171
00:55:35.421 --> 00:55:40.340
<v Speaker 4>off right now and not gas out because if a guy is still there and you unload on</v>

2172
00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:40.520
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2173
00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:44.060
<v Speaker 4>And so he backed off and then he thanked me after the fight.</v>

2174
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:44.781
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2175
00:55:44.781 --> 00:55:45.590
<v Speaker 4>that was good advice,</v>

2176
00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:46.423
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2177
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:48.920
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

2178
00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.091
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2179
00:55:49.091 --> 00:55:51.410
<v Speaker 4>he's on top and he's fucking Neto up.</v>

2180
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:51.861
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2181
00:55:51.861 --> 00:55:52.694
<v Speaker 4>big elbow.</v>

2182
00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.451
<v Speaker 4>Dave Jansen,</v>

2183
00:55:53.451 --> 00:55:54.111
<v Speaker 4>Kia Tina guy.</v>

2184
00:55:54.111 --> 00:55:54.501
<v Speaker 4>One time.</v>

2185
00:55:54.501 --> 00:55:54.921
<v Speaker 4>It didn't one,</v>

2186
00:55:54.921 --> 00:55:55.754
<v Speaker 4>cause I told him too.</v>

2187
00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:56.571
<v Speaker 4>I didn't tell him too.</v>

2188
00:55:56.571 --> 00:55:58.320
<v Speaker 4>I just said it's a good position for a beauty.</v>

2189
00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:58.581
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

2190
00:55:58.581 --> 00:55:59.900
<v Speaker 4>I heard you went for the kitchen and you got it.</v>

2191
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:01.251
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2192
00:56:01.251 --> 00:56:01.940
<v Speaker 4>you're welcome.</v>

2193
00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:05.240
<v Speaker 4>It's a weird thing like sometimes guys will be right in front of me and I'll say</v>

2194
00:56:05.241 --> 00:56:08.090
<v Speaker 4>what he's got to do to pass this when he's got to do to get out and you'll see</v>

2195
00:56:08.091 --> 00:56:08.960
<v Speaker 4>the guy doing it.</v>

2196
00:56:09.450 --> 00:56:12.620
<v Speaker 4>But you know you're kind of coaching them but you kind of have to it just</v>

2197
00:56:12.621 --> 00:56:13.730
<v Speaker 4>because they're in front of you.</v>

2198
00:56:13.731 --> 00:56:15.260
<v Speaker 4>You still have to say stop talking.</v>

2199
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2200
00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:17.690
<v Speaker 4>You still have to say what's your should be done.</v>

2201
00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:19.070
<v Speaker 4>Next time I pick somebody up,</v>

2202
00:56:19.071 --> 00:56:20.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to throw him over right there.</v>

2203
00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:21.900
<v Speaker 4>Tell me what to do.</v>

2204
00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:25.870
<v Speaker 4>I'll help you out if I know and sometimes I'm baffled.</v>

2205
00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:28.840
<v Speaker 4>What do you think about having big crazy dreadlocks like that?</v>

2206
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:30.460
<v Speaker 4>That would make it harder to get out of shit?</v>

2207
00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't a lot harder I imagine.</v>

2208
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:33.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean it looks sexy as fuck Clint,</v>

2212
00:56:38.130 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2213
00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:39.400
<v Speaker 4>I always thought that about clay.</v>

2214
00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:40.570
<v Speaker 4>Seriously.</v>

2215
00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Clay,</v>

2216
00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:41.110
<v Speaker 4>Cancun.</v>

2220
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:46.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2221
00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.730
<v Speaker 4>Fighting with that hair.</v>

2222
00:56:47.731 --> 00:56:49.300
<v Speaker 4>And the other thing is what if you get hit,</v>

2223
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:50.280
<v Speaker 4>it goes flying through the air.</v>

2224
00:56:50.281 --> 00:56:50.341
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>

2225
00:56:50.341 --> 00:56:50.801
<v Speaker 4>it makes it look little.</v>

2226
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:52.210
<v Speaker 4>You got to hit a lot harder than you did.</v>

2227
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:53.231
<v Speaker 4>I've been,</v>

2228
00:56:53.231 --> 00:56:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Hennessy is always fucking with his hair.</v>

2229
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:56.770
<v Speaker 4>Every time he fights it look good man.</v>

2230
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.080
<v Speaker 4>How about the fact that the dude used to fight with a toothpick in his mouth?</v>

2231
00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:00.430
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>

2232
00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.670
<v Speaker 4>Fought championship level fights with the fucking toothpick in his mouth.</v>

2233
00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.650
<v Speaker 4>Is he going to have to take them down to the officially catch that or he'd just</v>

2234
00:57:08.651 --> 00:57:08.981
<v Speaker 4>stopped it.</v>

2235
00:57:08.981 --> 00:57:09.814
<v Speaker 4>I caught it.</v>

2236
00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:10.450
<v Speaker 4>I know they,</v>

2237
00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:11.081
<v Speaker 4>they caught him.</v>

2238
00:57:11.081 --> 00:57:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Did they go cut that shit out?</v>

2239
00:57:13.340 --> 00:57:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Check his mouth.</v>

2240
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:14.771
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

2241
00:57:14.771 --> 00:57:15.310
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2242
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:15.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2243
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:19.070
<v Speaker 4>they like alerted him and no one certain terms like bro,</v>

2244
00:57:19.071 --> 00:57:19.904
<v Speaker 4>he can't do that.</v>

2245
00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:22.750
<v Speaker 4>He's so crazy,</v>

2246
00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:24.580
<v Speaker 4>guys fighting world champions.</v>

2247
00:57:24.581 --> 00:57:25.990
<v Speaker 4>He's got a fucking toothpick in his mouth.</v>

2248
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't know where he was sticking that thing on this tooth as his mouthpiece,</v>

2249
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:32.470
<v Speaker 4>but it's a lower,</v>

2250
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:35.350
<v Speaker 4>he's hiding in the lower part of his mouth and your throat.</v>

2251
00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.030
<v Speaker 4>You're done in the middle of a fight.</v>

2252
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:38.403
<v Speaker 4>It could too.</v>

2253
00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:40.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh easily going to get rocked.</v>

2254
00:57:40.271 --> 00:57:41.410
<v Speaker 4>Everybody gets rocked.</v>

2255
00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:42.540
<v Speaker 4>You gotta look smooth and you know,</v>

2256
00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.091
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2257
00:57:43.091 --> 00:57:48.091
<v Speaker 4>so arguably that was in his face in his mouth when he got showtime kicked when</v>

2258
00:57:48.101 --> 00:57:48.934
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Pennys yeah,</v>

2259
00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:51.070
<v Speaker 4>leaping kicked him in the face and he went flying.</v>

2260
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.210
<v Speaker 4>He had a toothpick in his mouth</v>

2261
00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.611
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2262
00:57:54.611 --> 00:57:54.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2263
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:55.371
<v Speaker 4>I don't worry.</v>

2264
00:57:55.371 --> 00:57:55.990
<v Speaker 4>I swallowed it.</v>

2265
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:57.250
<v Speaker 4>I know he did once Matt.</v>

2266
00:57:57.251 --> 00:58:00.100
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why I know he did is because the fight was over.</v>

2267
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:04.630
<v Speaker 4>I was watching him and then all sudden I watched him pull a toothpick out of his</v>

2268
00:58:04.631 --> 00:58:04.811
<v Speaker 4>mouth.</v>

2269
00:58:04.811 --> 00:58:08.230
<v Speaker 4>Like I saw the fight being over the is fine I believe.</v>

2270
00:58:08.231 --> 00:58:08.471
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's,</v>

2271
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:09.430
<v Speaker 4>remember you talking about it?</v>

2272
00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:10.660
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was the Diaz fight.</v>

2273
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:10.991
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

2274
00:58:10.991 --> 00:58:11.830
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure though,</v>

2275
00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:13.000
<v Speaker 4>but whatever it was,</v>

2276
00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:15.430
<v Speaker 4>he had a toothpick in his mouth and I go,</v>

2277
00:58:15.431 --> 00:58:16.110
<v Speaker 4>where'd you get that too?</v>

2278
00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:16.300
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

2279
00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:17.830
<v Speaker 4>I asked him in the post fight interview like,</v>

2280
00:58:17.831 --> 00:58:18.820
<v Speaker 4>where'd you get that toothpick?</v>

2281
00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.140
<v Speaker 4>Like you had to pick any my like,</v>

2282
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.441
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2283
00:58:20.441 --> 00:58:20.590
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2284
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:20.950
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2285
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:23.500
<v Speaker 4>And then I talked to John Crouch about and he's like,</v>

2286
00:58:23.501 --> 00:58:23.681
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2287
00:58:23.681 --> 00:58:24.910
<v Speaker 4>I can't get them to stop doing that.</v>

2288
00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't get him to stop fighting with a bucket</v>

2289
00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.240
<v Speaker 4>of all the shit you can get him to do in training.</v>

2290
00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:32.531
<v Speaker 4>You can't go.</v>

2291
00:58:32.531 --> 00:58:34.120
<v Speaker 4>Don't do this life threatening shit.</v>

2292
00:58:34.121 --> 00:58:35.080
<v Speaker 4>You gotta pick your battles.</v>

2293
00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:35.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2294
00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:36.341
<v Speaker 4>great shape.</v>

2295
00:58:36.341 --> 00:58:36.911
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't drink,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was like hanging off of his body and he landed a beautiful picture.</v>

2329
00:59:25.611 --> 00:59:29.840
<v Speaker 4>Perfect wrap around left high kick just like you landed on Lozan.</v>

2330
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.260
<v Speaker 4>What I don't want to see honestly what concerns me is,</v>

2331
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:34.123
<v Speaker 4>is</v>

2332
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:35.640
<v Speaker 5>Gotcha Ring Russ</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just keep him out so much.</v>

2337
00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.231
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

2338
00:59:40.231 --> 00:59:42.090
<v Speaker 4>I hate seeing guys like that are so talented,</v>

2339
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:44.300
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>

2340
00:59:44.430 --> 00:59:45.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say fragile,</v>

2341
00:59:45.451 --> 00:59:46.560
<v Speaker 4>but injury prone.</v>

2342
00:59:46.561 --> 00:59:48.570
<v Speaker 4>Have you want to put it where they don't get that rhythm they need,</v>

2343
00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.010
<v Speaker 4>I call myself clean Hester.</v>

2344
00:59:50.011 --> 00:59:50.401
<v Speaker 4>Got It.</v>

2345
00:59:50.401 --> 00:59:50.790
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

2346
00:59:50.790 --> 00:59:52.880
<v Speaker 4>Clint has to one interested in.</v>

2347
00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.113
<v Speaker 4>Very interesting.</v>

2348
00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.050
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I agree with that,</v>

2349
00:59:55.051 --> 00:59:55.900
<v Speaker 4>but yeah.</v>

2350
00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:56.041
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2351
00:59:56.041 --> 00:59:58.410
<v Speaker 4>the neither does Neto.</v>

2352
00:59:58.770 --> 00:59:59.603
<v Speaker 4>It looks pretty upset,</v>

2353
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:00.991
<v Speaker 4>but he took,</v>

2354
01:00:00.991 --> 01:00:03.480
<v Speaker 4>the first two would look like the third round he won.</v>

2355
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:04.560
<v Speaker 4>I mean for sure.</v>

2356
01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.480
<v Speaker 4>Beaten them up in the third round in the beginning.</v>

2357
01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Took him to the ground.</v>

2358
01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.060
<v Speaker 4>He got mounted,</v>

2359
01:00:09.061 --> 01:00:10.070
<v Speaker 4>but then he got on top.</v>

2360
01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:11.070
<v Speaker 4>Wound up in his guard.</v>

2361
01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:11.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2362
01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.950
<v Speaker 4>I thought I thought no one the first two rounds,</v>

2363
01:00:13.951 --> 01:00:15.210
<v Speaker 4>but I guess not.</v>

2364
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:15.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2365
01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:16.530
<v Speaker 4>Well who knows?</v>

2366
01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:18.540
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what the fuck the judges are saying?</v>

2367
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:19.890
<v Speaker 4>That was a beautiful take down,</v>

2368
01:00:19.891 --> 01:00:22.320
<v Speaker 4>but show the deep half bit beautiful sweep.</v>

2369
01:00:22.510 --> 01:00:23.490
<v Speaker 4>Show the sweep.</v>

2370
01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:28.390
<v Speaker 4>It's funny how after fights they're only showing like the guy who wants island</v>

2371
01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:29.640
<v Speaker 4>look like a blowout.</v>

2372
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:30.471
<v Speaker 4>I had to talk to my editor,</v>

2373
01:00:30.471 --> 01:00:31.770
<v Speaker 4>the the people who cut them.</v>

2374
01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you have any input in that.</v>

2375
01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:33.300
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2376
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I'll go to the truck and go,</v>

2377
01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:34.810
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

2378
01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:36.120
<v Speaker 4>you make it look like a blowout.</v>

2379
01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.150
<v Speaker 4>Like you give me a close fight and the replays are one dude beaten the other</v>

2380
01:00:39.151 --> 01:00:39.261
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>

2381
01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:39.490
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>

2382
01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:40.890
<v Speaker 4>you'd make it look like stop doing that.</v>

2383
01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.220
<v Speaker 4>The problem with that you have as they're doing this move of the fight thing,</v>

2384
01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:46.440
<v Speaker 4>so they're not calling it like a replay.</v>

2385
01:00:46.441 --> 01:00:46.940
<v Speaker 4>The calling,</v>

2386
01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.970
<v Speaker 4>the move of the fight,</v>

2387
01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:49.013
<v Speaker 4>but the fight,</v>

2388
01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:50.220
<v Speaker 4>that fight especially,</v>

2389
01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:51.750
<v Speaker 4>that was a very close fight.</v>

2390
01:00:51.751 --> 01:00:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2391
01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.100
<v Speaker 4>it was a good fight.</v>

2392
01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:56.610
<v Speaker 4>So you got to show both sides and when you have something as beautiful is that</v>

2393
01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.200
<v Speaker 4>that sweep Charlotte Shit.</v>

2394
01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:03.160
<v Speaker 4>Michael Pena in the building.</v>

2395
01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:05.680
<v Speaker 4>He's an actor on end of watch.</v>

2396
01:01:05.681 --> 01:01:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what end of watches?</v>

2397
01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2398
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:09.320
<v Speaker 4>the movie into watch Jake Gyllenhaal.</v>

2399
01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:09.701
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2400
01:01:09.701 --> 01:01:10.534
<v Speaker 4>Jake Gyllenhaal.</v>

2401
01:01:10.570 --> 01:01:11.403
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2402
01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:12.070
<v Speaker 4>pin.</v>

2403
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.800
<v Speaker 4>And he's funny in everything he does is it's a cop movie,</v>

2404
01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:17.590
<v Speaker 4>but like a serious cop movie where they know it was on a training day,</v>

2405
01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:18.490
<v Speaker 4>like a training day time.</v>

2406
01:01:18.491 --> 01:01:19.031
<v Speaker 4>Pretty recent,</v>

2407
01:01:19.031 --> 01:01:19.260
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2408
01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:19.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:19.991
<v Speaker 4>Pretty recent.</v>

2410
01:01:19.991 --> 01:01:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Couple of years.</v>

2411
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:21.700
<v Speaker 4>You know what's going on,</v>

2412
01:01:21.701 --> 01:01:25.240
<v Speaker 4>their partners and someone dies or they both die or no gay cowboy stuff.</v>

2413
01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:26.170
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2414
01:01:26.170 --> 01:01:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I see Jake Eula Hall,</v>

2415
01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.280
<v Speaker 4>that's where your brain goes.</v>

2416
01:01:30.281 --> 01:01:30.361
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2417
01:01:30.361 --> 01:01:31.194
<v Speaker 4>that's where it goes.</v>

2418
01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:31.470
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2419
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.940
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

2420
01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.800
<v Speaker 4>you suck one day here,</v>

2421
01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:34.690
<v Speaker 4>a cock sucker for the rest of your life.</v>

2422
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:37.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't think you dad's the only guy says that you can build this.</v>

2423
01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:40.120
<v Speaker 4>You can build a million pills in your lifetime and never be a bridge builder.</v>

2424
01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:41.500
<v Speaker 4>Life life lessons.</v>

2425
01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:42.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2426
01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:46.240
<v Speaker 4>There's some certain things you want to avoid and gay cowboy movies are one of</v>

2427
01:01:46.241 --> 01:01:46.840
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

2428
01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.960
<v Speaker 4>but that's a funny one.</v>

2429
01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:49.540
<v Speaker 4>Covered pretty well man.</v>

2430
01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:50.720
<v Speaker 4>I both guys were,</v>

2431
01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:54.160
<v Speaker 4>the other ones were making fun of,</v>

2432
01:01:54.161 --> 01:01:55.570
<v Speaker 4>so I got to make,</v>

2433
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.550
<v Speaker 4>he's doing all right.</v>

2434

2479
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:18.840
<v Speaker 2>If like if you just met them and just like,</v>

2489
01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.373
<v Speaker 2>soon as you hit on them,</v>

01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:45.540
<v Speaker 2>breathe.</v>

2495
01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:52.683
<v Speaker 2>Just breathe.</v>

2501
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.630
<v Speaker 2>The cryo chamber is supposed to be a mother fucker.</v>

2502
01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:56.220
<v Speaker 2>I got to do that in between rounds.</v>

2503
01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Breathe every day.</v>

2504
01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:57.931
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2505
01:03:57.931 --> 01:03:59.190
<v Speaker 2>How far away is it from your house?</v>

2506
01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:00.940
<v Speaker 2>It's in between my strength conditioning,</v>

2507
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:01.480
<v Speaker 2>champagne,</v>

2508
01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.313
<v Speaker 2>my real gym.</v>

2509
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:04.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you do a post workout or pre?</v>

2510
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:05.753
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2511
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.200
<v Speaker 2>I do it at 10 o'clock every day.</v>

2512
01:04:07.201 --> 01:04:10.080
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes I work out before it and sometimes I don't work.</v>

2513
01:04:10.081 --> 01:04:10.980
<v Speaker 2>I just go straight there.</v>

2514
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Is there any restrictions on,</v>

2515
01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.300
<v Speaker 2>for folks who don't know what the crowd chamber is explained with Nora's better</v>

2516
01:04:15.301 --> 01:04:15.571
<v Speaker 2>than me,</v>

2517
01:04:15.571 --> 01:04:16.560
<v Speaker 2>so I just do it everyday.</v>

2518
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:18.871
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2519
01:04:18.871 --> 01:04:19.710
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2520
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:21.900
<v Speaker 2>you get into a little pod cylinder thing.</v>

2521
01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:22.441
<v Speaker 2>It opens up,</v>

2522
01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:22.890
<v Speaker 2>you get in,</v>

2523
01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:23.641
<v Speaker 2>they raise the floor up.</v>

2524
01:04:23.641 --> 01:04:24.630
<v Speaker 2>So your head's above the,</v>

2525
01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:25.573
<v Speaker 2>the top.</v>

2526
01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.920
<v Speaker 2>They pumping liquid nitrogen,</v>

2527
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:29.010
<v Speaker 2>liquid nitrogen hits oxygen,</v>

2528
01:04:29.011 --> 01:04:31.020
<v Speaker 2>it turns into a gas science class.</v>

2529
01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:31.981
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2530
01:04:31.981 --> 01:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2531
01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:32.541
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2532
01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:32.790
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2533
01:04:32.790 --> 01:04:37.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's heavier so it sits in there and it gets down to minus two 56 usually</v>

2534
01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.110
<v Speaker 2>Fahrenheit.</v>

2535
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 2>At W I set the record of our place for two 63.</v>

2536
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2537
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:44.220
<v Speaker 2>You wanted more,</v>

2538
01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:45.480
<v Speaker 2>you wanted it colder.</v>

2539
01:04:45.481 --> 01:04:46.314
<v Speaker 2>She just,</v>

2540
01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:47.213
<v Speaker 2>she just does it.</v>

2541
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>What's between you and she's like,</v>

2542
01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:49.381
<v Speaker 2>you can take it.</v>

2543
01:04:49.381 --> 01:04:50.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try something and I'm like,</v>

2544
01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:52.130
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to try something on you.</v>

2545
01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2546
01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.830
<v Speaker 2>See degrees below zero isn't quite doing it.</v>

2547
01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:59.070
<v Speaker 2>So where I recommend that for everybody,</v>

2548
01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:00.780
<v Speaker 2>it's probably the singular best thing I've ever done.</v>

2549
01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2550
01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:02.903
<v Speaker 2>What way?</v>

2551
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Recovery?</v>

2552
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:04.211
<v Speaker 2>Recovery.</v>

2553
01:05:04.211 --> 01:05:05.620
<v Speaker 2>At least what it like what,</v>

2554
01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:06.990
<v Speaker 2>what does it do that so awesome.</v>

2555
01:05:06.991 --> 01:05:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Like give me just feel better and things like the swelling goes down of</v>

2556
01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:11.550
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

2557
01:05:11.550 --> 01:05:12.660
<v Speaker 2>Bruising goes away.</v>

2558
01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.910
<v Speaker 2>You get out and you only ended in the front for three minutes.</v>

2559
01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean I last three minutes,</v>

2560
01:05:16.141 --> 01:05:17.440
<v Speaker 2>but most people less than a minute two.</v>

2561
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.460
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2562
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.830
<v Speaker 3>I just [inaudible] he just got it out.</v>

2563
01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:21.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2564
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.450
<v Speaker 3>Just cause there's something wrong and then once you get you,</v>

2565
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:24.500
<v Speaker 3>it's definitely something wrong with it.</v>

2566
01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:26.800
<v Speaker 3>And then once he get out,</v>

2567
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:30.310
<v Speaker 3>it's just like all the blood flushes to your skin of rush of blood.</v>

2568
01:05:30.311 --> 01:05:31.144
<v Speaker 3>And I want to go,</v>

2569
01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2570
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.070
<v Speaker 3>this is a new thing too,</v>

2571
01:05:33.071 --> 01:05:33.341
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2572
01:05:33.341 --> 01:05:34.960
<v Speaker 3>They've only been doing it for the last one in Europe,</v>

2573
01:05:34.961 --> 01:05:35.980
<v Speaker 3>that gators decades.</v>

2574
01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:36.491
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>

2575
01:05:36.491 --> 01:05:37.540
<v Speaker 3>Everything's been in Europe for instance,</v>

2576
01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:39.740
<v Speaker 3>as long as the u s has had for five years or something like that.</v>

2577
01:05:39.741 --> 01:05:40.574
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2578
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:41.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

2579
01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:42.003
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty,</v>

2580
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:42.911
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty awesome.</v>

2581
01:05:42.911 --> 01:05:43.541
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I watched bubble comics theater on Disney to be Ho Chi.</v>

2676
01:07:54.511 --> 01:07:55.344
<v Speaker 3>Last,</v>

2677
01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:56.170
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2678
01:07:56.170 --> 01:08:01.170
<v Speaker 3>James Hatfield is the commentator or the narrator and they go to Kodiak Island</v>

2679
01:08:01.991 --> 01:08:05.050
<v Speaker 3>where the biggest grizzly bears in the world live biggest brown bears in the</v>

2680
01:08:05.051 --> 01:08:05.500
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2681
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.980
<v Speaker 3>And these bears are 10 feet fucking tall and these guys are hunting these 10</v>

2682
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:09.790
<v Speaker 3>foot tall bear.</v>

2683
01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:13.330
<v Speaker 3>That's the kind of skin I have freaking out about.</v>

2684
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Hetfield being a part is they wanted to remove him from the Glastonbury</v>

<v Speaker 4>music festival and everybody's angry.</v>

2686
01:08:18.621 --> 01:08:20.300
<v Speaker 4>And we know that if you love bears,</v>

2687
01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:23.120
<v Speaker 4>you got to kill the big Boris cause if you don't kill the big boards,</v>

01:08:23.901 --> 01:08:28.280
<v Speaker 4>Like people who don't understand bears or freaking out about that show.</v>

2690
01:08:28.281 --> 01:08:31.570
<v Speaker 4>Like they need to kill bears to keep the population healthy,</v>

2691
01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.990
<v Speaker 4>otherwise they're going to fuck each other up.</v>

2692
01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:33.111
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2693
01:08:33.111 --> 01:08:36.650
<v Speaker 4>the first conservation were hunters because they were out there in the</v>

2698
01:08:42.741 --> 01:08:44.360

2699
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:44.791
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2700
01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:45.140

01:08:52.641 --> 01:08:55.040
<v Speaker 4>conservation all comes from hunting license.</v>

<v Speaker 4>correctly.</v>

2765

<v Speaker 4>Very good on the ground.</v>

2766
01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:30.220
<v Speaker 4>And also like a lot like Aldo is very competent standing up and not quite as</v>

2767
01:10:31.971 --> 01:10:34.610
<v Speaker 4>good but still very competent.</v>

2768
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:35.901

<v Speaker 4>Standing up with this guy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

2781
01:10:52.761 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 4>I remember when he came out to,</v>

2782
01:10:53.931 --> 01:10:54.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2783

01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:56.430

2785
01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.540
<v Speaker 4>but fought favor and that in Sacramento and it was just like,</v>

2786
01:10:59.910 --> 01:11:00.170
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2787
01:11:00.170 --> 01:11:00.960
<v Speaker 4>you're an awesome.</v>

2788
01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:01.610
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2789
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:03.750
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the nastiest leg kicked.</v>

2790
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Oh God.</v>

2791
01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:05.290
<v Speaker 4>That was Beverly.</v>

2792
01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:06.123
<v Speaker 4>Ever seen.</v>

2793
01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:07.310
<v Speaker 4>It was horrific.</v>

2794
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:10.410
<v Speaker 4>And seeing his legs on Instagram after the fight where you're,</v>

2795
01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:15.460
<v Speaker 4>I kept taking pictures of his leg and it was up to literally twice the size.</v>

2796
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:17.340
<v Speaker 4>It's not one month later and it was still not good.</v>

2797
01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:18.361
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2798
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:18.511
<v Speaker 4>Bro,</v>

2799
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:19.260
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>

2800
01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 4>Randy coture told me that it took him six months to recover from the Pedro has a</v>

2801
01:11:23.191 --> 01:11:23.590
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>

2802
01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2803
01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:24.960
<v Speaker 4>That's what was so hard.</v>

2804
01:11:24.961 --> 01:11:28.140
<v Speaker 4>It was hard alliance that second fight and the first fight.</v>

2805
01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.570
<v Speaker 4>Most people who watch thought that Pedro one,</v>

2806
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:31.310
<v Speaker 4>I thought he did.</v>

2807
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2808
01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people thought he did his old school and then Randy came back and beat</v>

2809
01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:36.960
<v Speaker 4>the fuck out of Pedro.</v>

2810
01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:37.950
<v Speaker 4>His own the second fight.</v>

2811
01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:39.010
<v Speaker 4>Thinking about those like,</v>

2812
01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:41.280
<v Speaker 4>it's like not today son.</v>

2813
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:41.581
<v Speaker 4>His,</v>

2814
01:11:41.581 --> 01:11:41.671
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2815
01:11:41.671 --> 01:11:43.830
<v Speaker 4>had a tendency to start slow in that costume.</v>

2816
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:45.090
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] you see those guys?</v>

2817
01:11:45.091 --> 01:11:46.800
<v Speaker 4>I came in the earth's kick a bag.</v>

2818
01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:48.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2819
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.160
<v Speaker 4>I used to go over to Marco's a little bit.</v>

2820
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:50.771
<v Speaker 4>Who?</v>

2821
01:11:50.771 --> 01:11:54.480
<v Speaker 4>Oss and seeing those giant people kicked bags and stuff.</v>

2822
01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:55.590
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2823
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.250
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2824
01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:59.410
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen anybody kick anything harder than I've seen Pedro Huizar kick.</v>

2825
01:12:00.570 --> 01:12:03.120
<v Speaker 4>He kicked Rico Rodriguez once in their fight.</v>

2826
01:12:03.121 --> 01:12:05.260
<v Speaker 4>They're the most boring fight ever in the UFC was awful.</v>

2827
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:08.370
<v Speaker 4>He kicked him once and Rico was like,</v>

2828
01:12:08.430 --> 01:12:08.671
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2829
01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:09.510
<v Speaker 4>fuck all this,</v>

2830
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:10.530
<v Speaker 4>walk this shit,</v>

2831
01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:11.610
<v Speaker 4>all this.</v>

2832
01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:12.061
<v Speaker 4>Nothing.</v>

2833
01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:14.160
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anything but a body shot in a lake kick.</v>

2834
01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:15.150
<v Speaker 4>I've seen fighters go,</v>

2835
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:15.931
<v Speaker 4>fuck this.</v>

2836
01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:16.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm out.</v>

2837
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:19.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean just mentally check out completely of a fight from those two things.</v>

2838
01:12:19.351 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 4>Ricoh was in full defense mode from then on and just said,</v>

2839
01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:24.810
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>

2840
01:12:24.810 --> 01:12:26.130
<v Speaker 4>No one's knocking me the fuck out.</v>

2841
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 4>You're not breaking my leg.</v>

2842
01:12:27.121 --> 01:12:27.601
<v Speaker 4>So let's,</v>

2843
01:12:27.601 --> 01:12:28.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2844
01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.760
<v Speaker 4>let's just do what we gotta do here.</v>

2845
01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:32.400
<v Speaker 4>I'll collect my last Zuph a paycheck.</v>

2846
01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:34.560
<v Speaker 4>He made the agreement.</v>

2847
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:35.700
<v Speaker 4>I won't try to win.</v>

2848
01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 4>You don't try to hurt me.</v>

2849
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:38.380
<v Speaker 4>And you can see when a fighter does that,</v>

2850
01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:42.990
<v Speaker 4>I won't try and beat you if you will let me have my legs.</v>

2851
01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 4>There is a agreement.</v>

2852
01:12:44.101 --> 01:12:44.990
<v Speaker 4>They do it on time.</v>

2853
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.380
<v Speaker 4>They do and you see it in their eyes,</v>

2854
01:12:46.381 --> 01:12:46.740
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2855
01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 4>We see it all the time.</v>

2856
01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:48.870
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2857
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:50.910
<v Speaker 4>I will stop fighting if you won't hurt me.</v>

2858
01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:52.260
<v Speaker 4>It's a fascinating moment.</v>

2859
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:53.460
<v Speaker 4>We see a guy break.</v>

2860
01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 4>It's a fascinating and sometimes guys will break and then rebound and come back</v>

2861
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:59.130
<v Speaker 4>and break and rebound and come back.</v>

2862
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.680
<v Speaker 4>That sets where things get really interesting.</v>

2863
01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.220
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

2864
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:06.660
<v Speaker 4>the worst I think I've ever seen in between rounds was Dan Hornbuckle against</v>

2865
01:13:06.661 --> 01:13:07.494
<v Speaker 4>Ben Aspirin.</v>

2866
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:07.801
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

2867
01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:11.100
<v Speaker 4>I was again like sat in that corner like,</v>

2868
01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:15.540
<v Speaker 4>and he's at a black belt in intensity and every now good Dan humbucker was,</v>

2869
01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:19.170
<v Speaker 4>and he came back to that and sat in his corner with his head down and just</v>

2870
01:13:19.171 --> 01:13:21.950
<v Speaker 4>didn't look like the same dude after one round and getting tossed around.</v>

2871
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:23.430
<v Speaker 4>He just knew he was never going to catch up.</v>

2872
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:27.720
<v Speaker 4>When you lock up with a guy like ascaris and you get costs all over the place</v>

2873
01:13:27.721 --> 01:13:29.490
<v Speaker 4>and every time you're trying to counter what he's doing,</v>

2874
01:13:29.491 --> 01:13:30.900
<v Speaker 4>he's already countering your counter.</v>

2875
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:35.070
<v Speaker 4>He's one step ahead of you every time you down the whole time manhandling you.</v>

2876
01:13:35.250 --> 01:13:36.480
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

2877
01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:40.500
<v Speaker 4>he looks like he smokes pot all day and he's Cheetos dude.</v>

2878
01:13:40.501 --> 01:13:42.960
<v Speaker 4>He does it works at the seven 11 bro.</v>

2879
01:13:42.961 --> 01:13:46.460
<v Speaker 4>And he's kicking my ass kicking world clock.</v>

2880
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.590
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't look like Kevin Randleman road.</v>

2881
01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:49.140
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2882
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:49.311
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

2883
01:13:49.311 --> 01:13:50.850
<v Speaker 4>if he looked like Tyron Woodley,</v>

2884
01:13:50.851 --> 01:13:53.280
<v Speaker 4>you would understand it like I can't fuck with this guy.</v>

2885
01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.261
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

2886
01:13:54.261 --> 01:13:58.620
<v Speaker 4>he looks like a a silly stoner and he's just rag doll or had a little of that</v>

2887
01:13:58.621 --> 01:13:58.921
<v Speaker 4>and you're like,</v>

2888
01:13:58.921 --> 01:13:59.221
<v Speaker 4>Bro,</v>

2889
01:13:59.221 --> 01:14:00.660
<v Speaker 4>you do not look like you fight.</v>

2890
01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.630
<v Speaker 4>And he just get man dump dude.</v>

2891
01:14:02.650 --> 01:14:07.140
<v Speaker 4>The early days fade or win big when he was doing a lot of weightlifting and</v>

2892
01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:07.291
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2893
01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:10.050
<v Speaker 4>remember that picture of him standing around with a bunch of kettle bells.</v>

2894
01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.130
<v Speaker 4>This fucking him.</v>

2895
01:14:11.131 --> 01:14:12.220
<v Speaker 4>He's got some body fat</v>

2896
01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:12.491
<v Speaker 1>on him.</v>

2897
01:14:12.491 --> 01:14:13.660
<v Speaker 1>He always had body fat on him,</v>

2898
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:15.250
<v Speaker 1>but he was fucking big.</v>

2899
01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.730
<v Speaker 1>I went back and watched the Fajita fight again the other day.</v>

2900
01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:20.110
<v Speaker 1>He was big.</v>

2901
01:14:20.230 --> 01:14:23.260
<v Speaker 1>He was way bigger than he was when he fought Dan Henderson.</v>

2902
01:14:23.261 --> 01:14:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2903
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2904
01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.180
<v Speaker 1>By the time he fought Dan Henderson,</v>

2905
01:14:25.181 --> 01:14:26.560
<v Speaker 1>he kind of already checked out.</v>

2906
01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:28.970
<v Speaker 1>He was no longer know,</v>

2907
01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:29.700
<v Speaker 1>want more weights.</v>

2908
01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:30.533
<v Speaker 1>Oh I slept hook.</v>

2909
01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.270
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is and and uh,</v>

2910
01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo Lamas are going Outta here.</v>

2911
01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Diaz keeps landing that,</v>

2912
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:36.810
<v Speaker 1>that overhand right.</v>

2913
01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.120
<v Speaker 2>That is a fight that a punch really kind of funny,</v>

2914
01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:47.170
<v Speaker 2>that big loopy over and you almost never see in box and you see it constantly in</v>

2915
01:14:47.171 --> 01:14:47.530
<v Speaker 2>MMA.</v>

2916
01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:47.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2917
01:14:47.861 --> 01:14:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Cause those little gloves,</v>

2918
01:14:49.481 --> 01:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>it can fit.</v>

2919
01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 1>It always lands.</v>

2920
01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Why it's so interesting when you watch the uh,</v>

2921
01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:57.550
<v Speaker 1>the differences in the way guys cover up like in glory or in k one where so many</v>

2922
01:14:57.551 --> 01:14:58.361
<v Speaker 1>guys do that.</v>

2923
01:14:58.361 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Classic Dutch.</v>

2924
01:14:59.520 --> 01:14:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2925
01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:01.720
<v Speaker 1>Hold their hands up high guard.</v>

2926
01:15:01.721 --> 01:15:02.650
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

2927
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:06.970
<v Speaker 1>up to the eyebrows oooooo hard leg kick at the Bell Diaz is that says this is a</v>

2928
01:15:06.971 --> 01:15:09.040
<v Speaker 1>tough fight for Ricardo Lamas.</v>

2929
01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:10.750
<v Speaker 1>As long as it's coming off a title fight,</v>

2930
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.720
<v Speaker 1>would love to prove that he's still a top guy.</v>

2931
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot to gain in this fight because Hakan Diaz is not a big name,</v>

2932
01:15:16.690 --> 01:15:18.010
<v Speaker 1>but he's a bad motherfucker.</v>

2933
01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:19.730
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2934
01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.640
<v Speaker 2>Is also no on same team.</v>

2935
01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:22.231
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2936
01:15:22.231 --> 01:15:23.670
<v Speaker 2>They didn't talk about here's what I did.</v>

2937
01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.753
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

2938
01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 1>this is how you beat this guy.</v>

2939
01:15:26.490 --> 01:15:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2940
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.810
<v Speaker 1>Interesting that they all move the same too.</v>

2941
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:29.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2942
01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Like uh,</v>

2943
01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:30.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2944
01:15:30.970 --> 01:15:32.440
<v Speaker 1>you see that in Borow too,</v>

2945
01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:34.120
<v Speaker 1>very similar in their movements.</v>

2946
01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.850
<v Speaker 1>The defensive like the way they,</v>

2947
01:15:36.851 --> 01:15:37.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>

2948
01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 1>they let loose a little different,</v>

2949
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:40.900
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the defense is always the same,</v>

2950
01:15:40.901 --> 01:15:42.970
<v Speaker 1>just very tight.</v>

2951
01:15:43.530 --> 01:15:44.080
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty.</v>

2952
01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.320
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was so amazed at Tj Dillashaw so amazed.</v>

2953
01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen a guy rise to the moment like that.</v>

2954
01:15:49.811 --> 01:15:50.520
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

2955
01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:50.900
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

2956
01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:51.581
<v Speaker 1>that was incredible.</v>

2957
01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:52.391
<v Speaker 1>That was incredible.</v>

2958
01:15:52.391 --> 01:15:53.200
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the like,</v>

2959
01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.033
<v Speaker 1>like I thought,</v>

2960
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.371
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2961
01:15:54.371 --> 01:15:54.681
<v Speaker 1>he can,</v>

2962
01:15:54.681 --> 01:15:56.470
<v Speaker 1>he's going to make it a good fight out of it.</v>

2963
01:15:56.471 --> 01:15:57.460
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting.</v>

2964
01:15:57.461 --> 01:15:58.121
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could win.</v>

2965
01:15:58.121 --> 01:15:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2966
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what's going to happen,</v>

2967
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:03.910
<v Speaker 1>but you're dealing with a guy in Hanan Barao who was undefeated for nine years,</v>

2968
01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:07.860
<v Speaker 1>30 fucking fights without a loss and meanwhile TJ,</v>

2969
01:16:07.870 --> 01:16:10.500
<v Speaker 1>just random over random over after that,</v>

2970
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:11.380
<v Speaker 1>that when he dropped him,</v>

2971
01:16:11.381 --> 01:16:12.214
<v Speaker 1>that was just,</v>

2972
01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:13.333
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2973
01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.650
<v Speaker 1>he went back in the corner.</v>

2974
01:16:14.651 --> 01:16:15.700
<v Speaker 1>He had no idea what was going on.</v>

2975
01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:17.320
<v Speaker 1>When he was going into the fourth round,</v>

2976
01:16:17.321 --> 01:16:18.670
<v Speaker 1>he asked him if he was winning the fight.</v>

2977
01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.410
<v Speaker 1>He had no idea what was going on.</v>

2978
01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:24.320
<v Speaker 2>That is one of the scariest things to see as not just an MMA,</v>

2979
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:24.720
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2980
01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:25.770
<v Speaker 2>football or whatever.</v>

2981
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:26.963
<v Speaker 2>If a,</v>

2982
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:31.740
<v Speaker 2>when you see someone's brain just get rewired and you go,</v>

2983
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:33.060
<v Speaker 2>they're asking where they are.</v>

2984
01:16:33.061 --> 01:16:33.870
<v Speaker 2>They're asking one rounded.</v>

2985
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:34.110
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

2986
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:35.520
<v Speaker 2>They just don't know what's going on.</v>

2987
01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.090
<v Speaker 2>Mad happens quickly and guys want on a for.</v>

2988
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I've had people ask me,</v>

2989
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.980
<v Speaker 2>did I,</v>

2990
01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:41.880
<v Speaker 2>what happened to fight?</v>

2991
01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:43.740
<v Speaker 2>They fought five rounds and they're going,</v>

2992
01:16:43.741 --> 01:16:44.574
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

2993
01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:45.773
<v Speaker 2>You know what's scary?</v>

2994
01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:46.830
<v Speaker 2>Scary to look at it.</v>

2995
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:47.580
<v Speaker 2>That's scary.</v>

2996
01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:48.720
<v Speaker 1>But that's post fight.</v>

2997
01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.180
<v Speaker 1>What's scary than that is a dude who's not even fighting,</v>

2998
01:16:51.181 --> 01:16:55.140
<v Speaker 1>who tells you the same story three times in 10 minutes and you go,</v>

2999
01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:56.940
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

3000
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

3001
01:16:58.170 --> 01:17:01.530
<v Speaker 1>I used to know you before you used to do this and now you're doing this.</v>

3002
01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.290
<v Speaker 1>Now you don't remember saying what you just said five minutes ago.</v>

3003
01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:05.130
<v Speaker 1>You're saying it again.</v>

3004
01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:08.610
<v Speaker 1>So Ricardo Lamas has Diaz is back here.</v>

3005
01:17:08.611 --> 01:17:09.444
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of,</v>

3006
01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.333
<v Speaker 1>and he's,</v>

3007
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.450
<v Speaker 1>he's tried to take them down.</v>

3008
01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3009
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Bold Ricardo Lamas.</v>

3010
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Try to prove a point.</v>

3011
01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:15.231
<v Speaker 1>Good knees,</v>

3012
01:17:15.231 --> 01:17:15.771
<v Speaker 1>those land,</v>

3013
01:17:15.771 --> 01:17:16.490
<v Speaker 1>some good knees.</v>

3014
01:17:16.490 --> 01:17:17.241
<v Speaker 1>He's a good wrestler.</v>

3015
01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Llamas.</v>

3016
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:17.991
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3017
01:17:17.991 --> 01:17:20.180
<v Speaker 1>he is so fucking great ground and pound guy,</v>

3018
01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:20.391
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3019
01:17:20.391 --> 01:17:20.810
<v Speaker 1>It's ground up.</v>

3020
01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:21.501
<v Speaker 1>Pounds Nasty.</v>

3021
01:17:21.501 --> 01:17:23.180
<v Speaker 1>But this position is,</v>

3022
01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:23.391
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3023
01:17:23.391 --> 01:17:23.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3024
01:17:23.631 --> 01:17:23.930
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

3025
01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:25.160
<v Speaker 1>you're in a tricky spot here.</v>

3026
01:17:25.210 --> 01:17:26.800
<v Speaker 2>The other way to look at it though is,</v>

3027
01:17:26.801 --> 01:17:28.360
<v Speaker 2>is he not liking what he's seen on the feet?</v>

3028
01:17:28.361 --> 01:17:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3029
01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:29.950
<v Speaker 2>A lot of those right hands,</v>

3030
01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:30.893
<v Speaker 2>that leg kick on the,</v>

3031
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:31.630
<v Speaker 2>at the bell.</v>

3032
01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:32.331
<v Speaker 2>That was a hard way.</v>

3033
01:17:32.331 --> 01:17:32.841
<v Speaker 2>I was a good one.</v>

3034
01:17:32.841 --> 01:17:33.674
<v Speaker 2>Saw them around.</v>

3035
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:36.700
<v Speaker 2>When a guy does something different,</v>

3036
01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:37.311
<v Speaker 2>you also go,</v>

3037
01:17:37.311 --> 01:17:37.461
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3038
01:17:37.461 --> 01:17:39.440
<v Speaker 2>what motivated him to do that for gold grade on the feet?</v>

3039
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:40.274
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't be doing that.</v>

3040
01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3041
01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:41.211
<v Speaker 1>Very good point.</v>

3042
01:17:41.211 --> 01:17:42.110
<v Speaker 1>And then gets away.</v>

3043
01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So Diaz gets away without a doubt.</v>

3044
01:17:46.371 --> 01:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>He's looking for that kick.</v>

3045
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:49.450
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3046
01:17:49.450 --> 01:17:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting too because uh,</v>

3047
01:17:51.150 --> 01:17:51.441
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3048
01:17:51.441 --> 01:17:56.200
<v Speaker 1>the big kick of Aldo was something that lamas really worried about going into</v>

3049
01:17:56.201 --> 01:17:57.340
<v Speaker 1>that fight or shouldn't say worried.</v>

3050
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:58.240
<v Speaker 1>He knew that it was,</v>

3051
01:17:58.241 --> 01:17:58.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3052
01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:00.790
<v Speaker 1>there was another one who I knew knew it was coming,</v>

3053
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but did a really good job in defending,</v>

3054
01:18:02.981 --> 01:18:03.161
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3055
01:18:03.161 --> 01:18:05.050
<v Speaker 1>he was fine in the fifth round.</v>

3056
01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:05.261
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3057
01:18:05.261 --> 01:18:07.120
<v Speaker 1>obviously he got tagged a bunch of times,</v>

3058
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:09.280
<v Speaker 1>but you saw no noticeable limping.</v>

3059
01:18:09.281 --> 01:18:12.160
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't noticeably diminished because of it.</v>

3060
01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:13.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3061
01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:14.460
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3062
01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:18.390
<v Speaker 1>But here he's just taking a few in this first round and the second he didn't</v>

3063
01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:18.810
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

3064
01:18:18.810 --> 01:18:21.600
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want and I was like kicks and what's funny is</v>

3065
01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:25.740
<v Speaker 2>we were talking a little about cornering and if a guys getting kicked in the leg</v>

3066
01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:26.851
<v Speaker 2>and they go in the corner,</v>

3067
01:18:26.851 --> 01:18:28.410
<v Speaker 2>it goes check the kicks,</v>

3068
01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:29.431
<v Speaker 2>checking.</v>

3069
01:18:29.431 --> 01:18:30.600
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't trained it,</v>

3070
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:32.490
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't come fucking naturally.</v>

3071
01:18:32.491 --> 01:18:34.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't learn how to check in the middle of a fight.</v>

3072
01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:35.363
<v Speaker 2>You know where they go.</v>

3073
01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.600
<v Speaker 2>You know people ask me,</v>

3074
01:18:36.601 --> 01:18:36.721
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3075
01:18:36.721 --> 01:18:37.850
<v Speaker 2>should he start checking those kicks Mike?</v>

3076
01:18:37.890 --> 01:18:39.450
<v Speaker 2>If he hasn't been doing in training,</v>

3077
01:18:39.630 --> 01:18:40.860
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to work now.</v>

3078
01:18:40.861 --> 01:18:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It's really counterintuitive to like turn your Shin toward a guy was kicking</v>

3079
01:18:44.161 --> 01:18:44.480
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

3080
01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:45.660
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to happen.</v>

3081
01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:47.250
<v Speaker 2>You're going to think about it and it will be too late.</v>

3082
01:18:47.251 --> 01:18:47.791
<v Speaker 2>It'll be too late,</v>

3083
01:18:47.791 --> 01:18:48.150
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3084
01:18:48.150 --> 01:18:49.200
<v Speaker 2>It's very tough to do.</v>

3085
01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.290
<v Speaker 2>It's like slipped the punches if you don't know how to sleep on</v>

3086
01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.330
<v Speaker 2>her hands up like anybody</v>

3087
01:18:58.380 --> 01:18:59.650
<v Speaker 2>vicious left hook too.</v>

3088
01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

3089
01:19:00.450 --> 01:19:01.201
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>

3090
01:19:01.201 --> 01:19:02.160
<v Speaker 2>Why was this still in?</v>

3091
01:19:02.161 --> 01:19:03.300
<v Speaker 2>It is an animal.</v>

3092
01:19:03.330 --> 01:19:05.070
<v Speaker 2>That was a nice combination.</v>

3093
01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:05.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3094
01:19:05.311 --> 01:19:05.511
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

3095
01:19:05.511 --> 01:19:06.540
<v Speaker 2>he was in trouble there.</v>

3096
01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:09.570
<v Speaker 1>The kid has tremendous resolve.</v>

3097
01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous mental resolve.</v>

3098
01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.780
<v Speaker 1>Look at this pillow take down.</v>

3099
01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:16.080
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

3100
01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.690
<v Speaker 1>And as a little tire it takes a big deep breath right there.</v>

3101
01:19:18.900 --> 01:19:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about that.</v>

3102
01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.990
<v Speaker 2>That can be a little disheartening.</v>

3103
01:19:20.991 --> 01:19:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Hitting somebody with a punch like that and they come right back at you.</v>

3104
01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:24.100
<v Speaker 2>Hit him with suck.</v>

3105
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:25.700
<v Speaker 2>Read three mean ones,</v>

3106
01:19:25.701 --> 01:19:26.690
<v Speaker 2>three clean ones.</v>

3107
01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's too many fighters in MMA right now for the amount of fights</v>

3108
01:19:35.251 --> 01:19:36.084
<v Speaker 1>that are available?</v>

3109
01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:38.141
<v Speaker 1>Too many fighter.</v>

3110
01:19:38.141 --> 01:19:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Too many.</v>

3111
01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.230
<v Speaker 1>You know people were talking about the UFC has 500 fighters.</v>

3112
01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:42.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many belts or has,</v>

3113
01:19:42.670 --> 01:19:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but they just cut you guys.</v>

3114
01:19:43.771 --> 01:19:44.604
<v Speaker 1>They just cut a bunch.</v>

3115
01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:47.890
<v Speaker 1>They cut a hundred fighters.</v>

3116
01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:48.641
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

3117
01:19:48.641 --> 01:19:49.300

<v Speaker 1>I think Scott's going to run that shit.</v>

3123
01:19:55.531 --> 01:19:56.291
<v Speaker 1>Very smart guy.</v>

3124

3130
01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:03.070
<v Speaker 2>unheard of in the fight world.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hard,</v>

3132

<v Speaker 2>unheard of in the fight world.</v>

3212
01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:10.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a relationship with them.</v>

3213
01:22:11.050 --> 01:22:14.560
<v Speaker 1>You might think you know him if you want to be critical of his technique or his</v>

01:22:14.561 --> 01:22:15.370
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

3239
01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.221

01:27:20.711 --> 01:27:21.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3439
01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.360
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a lady who swallowed a fly.</v>

3440
01:27:22.361 --> 01:27:23.194
<v Speaker 2>I remember that poem.</v>

3441
01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3442
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.670
<v Speaker 2>she swatted,</v>

3443
01:27:24.670 --> 01:27:25.910
<v Speaker 2>swallowed a spider to catch a fly.</v>

3444
01:27:25.911 --> 01:27:27.670
<v Speaker 2>Just fall to bird swallow the spider.</v>

3445
01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Once you start doing,</v>

3446
01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:29.501
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3447
01:27:29.501 --> 01:27:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I was on this because I was on TRT because I did this,</v>

3448
01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:32.180
<v Speaker 2>I was getting bitches,</v>

3449
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:32.830
<v Speaker 2>I'd take this.</v>

3450
01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:34.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's just an endless stream.</v>

3451
01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.460
<v Speaker 2>When you start messing with that man,</v>

3452
01:27:36.461 --> 01:27:37.780
<v Speaker 2>it's an endless stream of shit.</v>

3453
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3454
01:27:38.410 --> 01:27:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's where shale wells and so it's out on bloody elbow.</v>

3455
01:27:41.561 --> 01:27:42.610
<v Speaker 1>So we can talk about it,</v>

3456
01:27:42.611 --> 01:27:42.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3457
01:27:42.970 --> 01:27:43.241
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3458
01:27:43.241 --> 01:27:45.610
<v Speaker 1>we can cause jail.</v>

3459
01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3460
01:27:46.570 --> 01:27:48.880
<v Speaker 1>he's in a situation now where,</v>

3461
01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:49.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3462
01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.980
<v Speaker 1>he got popped for a bunch of different shit that he was taking to try to recover</v>

3463
01:27:53.981 --> 01:27:56.050
<v Speaker 1>from the fact that he was on TRT.</v>

3464
01:27:56.051 --> 01:28:00.110
<v Speaker 1>And then what people people don't understand is when you get off a tee,</v>

3465
01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.000
<v Speaker 1>TRT,</v>

3466
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.650
<v Speaker 1>your body takes a long time to recover and get back to a point where it's</v>

3467
01:28:05.651 --> 01:28:07.750
<v Speaker 1>producing a natural level of testosterone.</v>

3468
01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:11.440
<v Speaker 1>So guys take things to try to reboot their system.</v>

3469
01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:14.860
<v Speaker 1>And the things that he tested positive for from the Nevada state athletic</v>

3470
01:28:14.861 --> 01:28:17.050
<v Speaker 1>commission were in those groups.</v>

3471
01:28:17.051 --> 01:28:21.850
<v Speaker 1>The groups have a estrogen inhibitors that they use to try to boost your</v>

3472
01:28:21.851 --> 01:28:22.750
<v Speaker 1>testosterone.</v>

3473
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:24.340
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

3474
01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.480
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>

3475
01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.310
<v Speaker 1>they went through the most comprehensive drug testing that they could possibly</v>

3476
01:28:30.311 --> 01:28:31.030
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

3477
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:33.700
<v Speaker 1>This thing that costs $45,000 per fighter.</v>

3478
01:28:33.970 --> 01:28:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3479
01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:35.800
<v Speaker 1>the guy shows up,</v>

3480
01:28:35.801 --> 01:28:36.760
<v Speaker 1>takes the blood,</v>

3481
01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:38.410
<v Speaker 1>leaves in a suitcase,</v>

3482
01:28:38.411 --> 01:28:40.300
<v Speaker 1>they have a chain of custody of the blood,</v>

3483
01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:42.100
<v Speaker 1>flies with it on a plane.</v>

3484
01:28:42.101 --> 01:28:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Like he's fucking handcuffed to it.</v>

3485
01:28:43.331 --> 01:28:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a,</v>

3486
01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:45.640
<v Speaker 1>like the nuclear button.</v>

3487
01:28:45.670 --> 01:28:46.421
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear codes.</v>

3488
01:28:46.421 --> 01:28:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3489
01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And they did this to jail and he tested positive for HGH and EPO,</v>

3490
01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:56.700
<v Speaker 1>which are not part of that group now for post a testosterone therapy.</v>

3491
01:28:57.701 --> 01:28:58.640
<v Speaker 1>So he had h,</v>

3492
01:28:58.641 --> 01:28:58.951
<v Speaker 1>g,</v>

3493
01:28:58.951 --> 01:29:02.220
<v Speaker 1>h she had EPO and then he had</v>

3494
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:05.440
<v Speaker 4>clomiphene and Anna Straws.</v>

3495
01:29:05.441 --> 01:29:07.200
<v Speaker 4>So on a struggle.</v>

3496
01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:09.750
<v Speaker 4>So apparently what,</v>

3497
01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:11.160
<v Speaker 4>you know what I think it is,</v>

3498
01:29:11.161 --> 01:29:14.880
<v Speaker 4>is he was just trying to just do something to jack up a system,</v>

3499
01:29:14.910 --> 01:29:15.240
<v Speaker 4>get,</v>

3500
01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.710
<v Speaker 4>get the fucking fires burning.</v>

3501
01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:18.810
<v Speaker 4>But how many guys are on each change?</v>

3502
01:29:19.220 --> 01:29:20.053
<v Speaker 4>A ton.</v>

3503
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:21.700
<v Speaker 4>Is it 90% what is it?</v>

3504
01:29:22.020 --> 01:29:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Is it 60 what's the number?</v>

3505
01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:25.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3506
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:26.183
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot.</v>

3507
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:27.630
<v Speaker 4>A lot of guys aren't HGH.</v>

3508
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:28.883
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

3509
01:29:29.230 --> 01:29:30.063
<v Speaker 4>Drum roll.</v>

3510
01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:32.740
<v Speaker 4>Cause it was,</v>

3511
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:35.460
<v Speaker 4>it works weird.</v>

3512
01:29:36.420 --> 01:29:36.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3513
01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.610
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of stuff that that works.</v>

3514
01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:40.050
<v Speaker 4>And for years it wasn't testable.</v>

3515
01:29:40.051 --> 01:29:40.850
<v Speaker 4>Now yeah,</v>

3516
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:41.180
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3517
01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:42.390
<v Speaker 4>they have developed that test,</v>

3518
01:29:42.391 --> 01:29:45.060
<v Speaker 4>but at it being that expensive,</v>

3519
01:29:45.061 --> 01:29:46.140
<v Speaker 4>they can't use it on everybody.</v>

3520
01:29:46.141 --> 01:29:47.100
<v Speaker 4>If it's 45 grand a pop,</v>

3521
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:47.431
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

3522
01:29:47.431 --> 01:29:48.480
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna use it on everybody.</v>

3523
01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:49.493
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

3524
01:29:49.900 --> 01:29:50.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3525
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:54.440
<v Speaker 4>I think anytime they get no Ricardo lamas that alarm us.</v>

3526
01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.293
<v Speaker 4>I think he deserved it.</v>

3527
01:29:55.330 --> 01:29:56.163
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>

3528
01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:57.230
<v Speaker 4>He took that fight.</v>

3529
01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:57.900
<v Speaker 4>Did,</v>

3530
01:29:57.900 --> 01:30:00.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm just amazed that he got his back like that.</v>

3531
01:30:00.211 --> 01:30:01.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm amazed as he,</v>

3532
01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.113
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3533
01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:05.460
<v Speaker 4>He got his bell rung and rung and kept coming and he took some nasty fucking</v>

3534
01:30:05.461 --> 01:30:05.771
<v Speaker 4>punch.</v>

3535
01:30:05.771 --> 01:30:06.330
<v Speaker 4>Those steps.</v>

3536
01:30:06.330 --> 01:30:06.631
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

3537
01:30:06.631 --> 01:30:06.811
<v Speaker 4>two,</v>

3538
01:30:06.811 --> 01:30:10.380
<v Speaker 4>three combination that he got hit with then immediately secured that clinch.</v>

3539
01:30:10.381 --> 01:30:11.400
<v Speaker 4>He's a real fighter man.</v>

3540
01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:11.901
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

3541
01:30:11.901 --> 01:30:12.391
<v Speaker 4>My masters,</v>

3542
01:30:12.391 --> 01:30:12.811
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>

3543
01:30:12.811 --> 01:30:14.610
<v Speaker 4>the coach behind them and my master's is a coach.</v>

3544
01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:15.930
<v Speaker 4>They're a team out of south Florida.</v>

3545
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:16.620
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3546
01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:19.290
<v Speaker 4>we were wondering about that before his team and everything's out of south</v>

3547
01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Florida.</v>

3548
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 4>That's where he's at now.</v>

3549
01:30:20.611 --> 01:30:21.630
<v Speaker 4>He's a Chicago guy.</v>

3550
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:22.361
<v Speaker 4>I think so,</v>

3551
01:30:22.361 --> 01:30:23.050
<v Speaker 4>but I know MMS,</v>

3552
01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:24.360
<v Speaker 4>MMA masters out of south Florida.</v>

3553
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3554
01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.553
<v Speaker 4>He um,</v>

3555
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.390
<v Speaker 4>she caught him on a handbrake on?</v>

3556
01:30:27.690 --> 01:30:27.931
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3557
01:30:27.931 --> 01:30:28.081
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3558
01:30:28.081 --> 01:30:29.090
<v Speaker 4>that was just the end of the fight.</v>

3559
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:30.190
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what that is.</v>

3560
01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:32.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking at his hand if what they're talking about that um,</v>

3561
01:30:32.370 --> 01:30:33.980
<v Speaker 4>we can't really hear the auto in here by the way.</v>

3562
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:34.440
<v Speaker 4>People,</v>

3563
01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:34.711
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3564
01:30:34.711 --> 01:30:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Well I mean we could,</v>

3565
01:30:35.551 --> 01:30:37.620
<v Speaker 4>but then that runs into weird issues.</v>

3566
01:30:37.890 --> 01:30:38.940
<v Speaker 4>Like if we were,</v>

3567
01:30:38.941 --> 01:30:39.774
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3568
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.130
<v Speaker 4>if we were doing this,</v>

3569
01:30:41.730 --> 01:30:42.141
<v Speaker 4>well the,</v>

3570
01:30:42.141 --> 01:30:44.160
<v Speaker 4>the thing is it's not totally legal.</v>

3571
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:47.550
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of on Fox.</v>

3572
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:48.241
<v Speaker 4>Like we would,</v>

3573
01:30:48.241 --> 01:30:51.660
<v Speaker 4>we would kind of be broadcast and other stuff kind of pirating and I kind of</v>

3574
01:30:51.661 --> 01:30:52.500
<v Speaker 4>worked for Fox,</v>

3575
01:30:52.501 --> 01:30:53.970
<v Speaker 4>kind of looked down on that.</v>

3576
01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:54.990
<v Speaker 4>They frown upon that.</v>

3577
01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:56.520
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's told me to not do this,</v>

3578
01:30:56.521 --> 01:30:57.630
<v Speaker 4>but when I told them I was doing this,</v>

3579
01:30:57.631 --> 01:30:58.464
<v Speaker 4>then what?</v>

3580
01:30:59.830 --> 01:31:00.830
<v Speaker 4>This can be a fucking,</v>

3581
01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:05.250

01:31:09.310 --> 01:31:13.140
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's a fight where he had a lot to lose and not a lot to gain.</v>

3587
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.891
<v Speaker 4>And he was late.</v>

3588
01:31:13.891 --> 01:31:15.720
<v Speaker 4>He was losing and he wasn't in the beginning.</v>

3589
01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:16.693
<v Speaker 4>That was a great fight.</v>

3604
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:35.730
<v Speaker 4>It looks like it's the Ricardo Lamas show.</v>

3605
01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:37.800
<v Speaker 4>They don't show any of a wood hoc.</v>

01:31:37.801 --> 01:31:38.551
<v Speaker 4>Ron Diaz did.</v>

3611
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:45.380
<v Speaker 4>The move of the fight,</v>

3612
01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:49.640
<v Speaker 4>I think the moves or fight move of the fight should be both.</v>

<v Speaker 4>20 losses.</v>

3672
01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.880
<v Speaker 4>They don't give a shit that fucking knock out of Weidman versus Silva.</v>

3673
01:33:03.881 --> 01:33:04.960
<v Speaker 4>That just showed him the replay.</v>

3674
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.823
<v Speaker 4>I watch it.</v>

3675
01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:06.910
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it a hundred times.</v>

3676
01:33:06.911 --> 01:33:07.930
<v Speaker 4>I still don't believe it's happening.</v>

3677
01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:09.371
<v Speaker 4>I just go,</v>

3678
01:33:09.371 --> 01:33:10.204
<v Speaker 4>there's no way.</v>

3679
01:33:10.210 --> 01:33:11.080
<v Speaker 4>There's no way that's real.</v>

3680
01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:14.410
<v Speaker 4>It's like you remember what buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson and you watch</v>

3681
01:33:14.411 --> 01:33:15.730
<v Speaker 4>the replay like 10 times in a row.</v>

3682
01:33:15.731 --> 01:33:16.001
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

3683
01:33:16.001 --> 01:33:16.840
<v Speaker 4>that didn't happen.</v>

3684
01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:17.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3685
01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:17.621
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

3686
01:33:17.621 --> 01:33:18.670
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching a Hologram.</v>

3687
01:33:18.690 --> 01:33:19.523
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3688
01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:20.950
<v Speaker 4>Upset in boxing history.</v>

3689
01:33:20.951 --> 01:33:21.820
<v Speaker 4>Crazy,</v>

3690
01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.950
<v Speaker 4>crazy upset in my opinion.</v>

3691
01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:25.300
<v Speaker 4>But when you watch it,</v>

3692
01:33:26.380 --> 01:33:26.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3693
01:33:26.711 --> 01:33:31.030
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem real like I got when I watch Hanan Barao Tj Dillashaw,</v>

3694
01:33:31.031 --> 01:33:31.864
<v Speaker 4>I've watched it again.</v>

3695
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:32.860
<v Speaker 4>It seems real.</v>

3696
01:33:32.980 --> 01:33:33.221
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3697
01:33:33.221 --> 01:33:35.050
<v Speaker 4>Tj put on a masterful performance,</v>

3698
01:33:35.051 --> 01:33:35.950
<v Speaker 4>but I believe it,</v>

3699
01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.230
<v Speaker 4>when I watched Weidman connect with that left hook,</v>

3700
01:33:38.231 --> 01:33:39.064
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3701
01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:40.600
<v Speaker 4>is this a parallel universe?</v>

3702
01:33:40.601 --> 01:33:41.320
<v Speaker 4>Is this something,</v>

3703
01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:43.750
<v Speaker 4>am I in a dream that really happened?</v>

3704
01:33:43.780 --> 01:33:44.680

3705
01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:46.360

3706
01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:47.453

3707

<v Speaker 4>they didn't bring an end swell water bag,</v>

3726
01:34:20.140 --> 01:34:22.990
<v Speaker 4>blubber glove full of ice ice water shit ever.</v>

3727
01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:23.341
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3728
01:34:23.341 --> 01:34:24.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

3729
01:34:24.370 --> 01:34:26.410
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have an end swell and that was,</v>

3730
01:34:26.411 --> 01:34:26.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3731
01:34:26.591 --> 01:34:27.820
<v Speaker 4>we were talking about cornering.</v>

3732
01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:29.680
<v Speaker 4>Go out and Mike,</v>

3733
01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:30.070
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

3734
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.520
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

3735
01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:30.851
<v Speaker 4>Mike,</v>

01:34:30.851 --> 01:34:31.684
<v Speaker 4>move your head.</v>

3737
01:34:31.690 --> 01:34:32.291
<v Speaker 4>You sitting here with you.</v>

3738
01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:32.651
<v Speaker 4>I mean there were,</v>

3739
01:34:32.651 --> 01:34:36.240
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't technical things that anybody could have told him and they lived,</v>

3740
01:34:36.241 --> 01:34:37.540
<v Speaker 4>just had no idea what to do.</v>

3741
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.870
<v Speaker 4>That's a kid always beating everybody else is a perfect example of a guy</v>

3742
01:34:40.871 --> 01:34:44.800
<v Speaker 4>learning from fantastic coaches and then thinking he doesn't need any more</v>

3743
01:34:44.801 --> 01:34:45.280
<v Speaker 4>coaching.</v>

3744
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:45.941
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Rooney,</v>

3745
01:34:45.941 --> 01:34:47.740
<v Speaker 4>amazing coach Kevin Rooney was amazing.</v>

3746
01:34:47.741 --> 01:34:51.490
<v Speaker 4>And before that customer pulled a gun on him</v>

3747
01:34:53.230 --> 01:34:54.900
<v Speaker 4>at tends to dampen the relationship.</v>

3748
01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.590
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to fuck Teddy's nice Mike.</v>

3749
01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:57.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3750
01:34:57.780 --> 01:34:58.430
<v Speaker 4>Generally</v>

3751
01:34:58.430 --> 01:35:00.860
<v Speaker 2>cornering his knees that you know,</v>

3752
01:35:01.050 --> 01:35:02.210
<v Speaker 2>you want to read a bad idea.</v>

3753
01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:03.410
<v Speaker 2>Fucking beast.</v>

3754
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Fucking savage.</v>

3755
01:35:04.770 --> 01:35:05.570
<v Speaker 2>Jeez.</v>

3756
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:08.000
<v Speaker 2>Can't believe leaving a little girls around my Tyson either.</v>

3757
01:35:08.001 --> 01:35:08.834
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

3758
01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:11.300
<v Speaker 2>speaking of scenes where you go,</v>

3759
01:35:11.301 --> 01:35:12.290
<v Speaker 2>did I just see that?</v>

3760
01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:15.560
<v Speaker 2>You know the interview he did before the Lennox fight,</v>

3761
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:17.990
<v Speaker 2>when there's a woman reporter and she says something goes,</v>

3762
01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:18.920
<v Speaker 2>are you talking on a turn?</v>

3763
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.911
<v Speaker 2>And she goes,</v>

3764
01:35:19.911 --> 01:35:20.960
<v Speaker 2>I thought we were all just talking.</v>

3765
01:35:20.961 --> 01:35:21.430
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

3766
01:35:21.430 --> 01:35:22.910
<v Speaker 2>cause I usually don't do interviews with women list.</v>

3767
01:35:22.911 --> 01:35:23.810
<v Speaker 2>So fornicate with me.</v>

3768
01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:24.700
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3769
01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:29.360
<v Speaker 2>you should stop talking now and who's go did I did I just see that?</v>

01:35:47.481 --> 01:35:50.520
<v Speaker 2>when you hear him now he talks about how much coke he was doing it.</v>

3789
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.863
<v Speaker 2>Prayed for me.</v>

3790
01:35:57.610 --> 01:35:58.970
<v Speaker 2>I want to eat his children.</v>

3791
01:35:59.160 --> 01:35:59.993
<v Speaker 2>I'm for riches.</v>

3792
01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.820
<v Speaker 2>My defects is impregnable.</v>

3794
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:04.183
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3795
01:36:04.190 --> 01:36:05.670
<v Speaker 2>John Sentence for roses.</v>

01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 2>Have you a chip.</v>

3797
01:36:06.831 --> 01:36:08.240
<v Speaker 2>It never lived precocious.</v>

3798
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3799
01:36:10.821 --> 01:36:11.500
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

3800
01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:12.440
<v Speaker 1>those were the days,</v>

3801
01:36:12.441 --> 01:36:12.741
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3802
01:36:12.741 --> 01:36:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Those were the days.</v>

3803
01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.060
<v Speaker 1>What do they show in the Weidman versus Liotta Machita fight.</v>

3804
01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:18.140
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about this?</v>

3805
01:36:18.141 --> 01:36:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that he's gonna be able to get ahold of Mitchell?</v>

3806
01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Machida is tough for anybody.</v>

3807
01:36:22.870 --> 01:36:24.340
<v Speaker 2>He's just his style,</v>

3808
01:36:24.341 --> 01:36:25.570
<v Speaker 2>his Kryptonite.</v>

3809
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:28.000
<v Speaker 2>And I have a tremendous respect for,</v>

3810
01:36:28.001 --> 01:36:28.834
<v Speaker 2>for uh,</v>

3811
01:36:29.170 --> 01:36:29.651
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

3812
01:36:29.651 --> 01:36:30.281
<v Speaker 2>He's five.</v>

3813
01:36:30.281 --> 01:36:32.470
<v Speaker 2>It's just you just can't get a handle on Machida.</v>

3814
01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.670
<v Speaker 2>He's so hard to get a handle on,</v>

3815
01:36:34.670 --> 01:36:35.140
<v Speaker 2>on man.</v>

3816
01:36:35.140 --> 01:36:35.921
<v Speaker 1>Why am I not as bad?</v>

3817
01:36:35.921 --> 01:36:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Knees to man real bad.</v>

3818
01:36:37.690 --> 01:36:40.450
<v Speaker 1>And he's fought through it because he's incredibly tough.</v>

3819
01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.790
<v Speaker 1>But he had Regena keen done on both of his knees.</v>

3820
01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3821
01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.640
<v Speaker 1>and then after he had Regena keen done,</v>

3822
01:36:45.670 --> 01:36:49.180
<v Speaker 1>he felt great and then fucked him up again and then had to get meniscus surgery.</v>

3823
01:36:49.181 --> 01:36:52.540
<v Speaker 1>So he got meniscus surgery on both knees and it wasn't that long ago.</v>

3824
01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:54.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's what canceled his last fight.</v>

3825
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:56.230
<v Speaker 1>That's what postpone the fight.</v>

3826
01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.251
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

3827
01:36:57.251 --> 01:36:57.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3828
01:36:57.461 --> 01:37:00.880
<v Speaker 1>obviously he was supposed to fight Vito or Vito had to pull out.</v>

3829
01:37:01.150 --> 01:37:03.640
<v Speaker 1>They still have a veto,</v>

3830
01:37:04.060 --> 01:37:06.280
<v Speaker 1>apparently still has to get licensed.</v>

3831
01:37:06.281 --> 01:37:08.590
<v Speaker 1>And tested and all that jazz,</v>

3832
01:37:08.591 --> 01:37:12.520
<v Speaker 1>but he's another one of those guys off the testosterone replacement and you</v>

3833
01:37:12.521 --> 01:37:12.671
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

3834
01:37:12.671 --> 01:37:13.504
<v Speaker 1>now what,</v>

3835
01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:15.520
<v Speaker 1>especially with this new ruling,</v>

3836
01:37:15.521 --> 01:37:16.390
<v Speaker 1>when they found out,</v>

3837
01:37:16.420 --> 01:37:19.480
<v Speaker 1>now that everybody knows that shale signing got popped and now that everybody</v>

3838
01:37:19.481 --> 01:37:20.890
<v Speaker 1>knows that he got popped with this,</v>

3839
01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:22.780
<v Speaker 1>this new testing that they're doing,</v>

3840
01:37:22.781 --> 01:37:24.550
<v Speaker 1>it's $45,000 testing.</v>

3841
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Who's scrambling right now?</v>

3842
01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:27.990
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm wondering about is who's right up on,</v>

3843
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.930
<v Speaker 1>oh shit.</v>

3844
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:31.180
<v Speaker 1>There's dudes are scrapped a lot of motherfuckers that are like,</v>

3845
01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:31.850
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

3846
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:33.190
<v Speaker 1>especially a lot of guys,</v>

3847
01:37:33.250 --> 01:37:34.420
<v Speaker 1>especially the older guys,</v>

3848
01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:36.190
<v Speaker 1>it's been anybody that was on it.</v>

3849
01:37:36.490 --> 01:37:37.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean anybody that,</v>

3850
01:37:37.271 --> 01:37:38.104
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was,</v>

3851
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:41.170
<v Speaker 1>there was only a handful of guys that were officially on testosterone</v>

3852
01:37:41.171 --> 01:37:42.004
<v Speaker 1>replacement,</v>

3853
01:37:42.430 --> 01:37:43.570
<v Speaker 1>but they're all fucked.</v>

3854
01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:44.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3855
01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:46.850
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson is the only one who's,</v>

3856
01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:51.640
<v Speaker 1>who's been able to fight on it and off it with very similar results.</v>

3857
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Like he fought a Rashad Evans,</v>

3858
01:37:53.621 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 1>he was off of it because Winnipeg have a sanctioning.</v>

3859
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:58.350
<v Speaker 4>They didn't sanction testosterone replacement.</v>

3860
01:37:58.590 --> 01:38:00.750
<v Speaker 4>So Dan apparently only takes a little bit of it,</v>

3861
01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:01.763
<v Speaker 4>so he's like,</v>

3862
01:38:01.770 --> 01:38:02.603
<v Speaker 4>I just won't take it.</v>

3863
01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 4>So he just fought without it and did didn't,</v>

3864
01:38:05.401 --> 01:38:08.580
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like a sweeping difference between how he looked.</v>

3865
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:09.713
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3866
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:12.390
<v Speaker 4>Dan's a guy by the way,</v>

3867
01:38:12.391 --> 01:38:12.901
<v Speaker 4>personally,</v>

3868
01:38:12.901 --> 01:38:15.270
<v Speaker 4>and he's training a little bit and Dan's a great guy.</v>

3869
01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.133
<v Speaker 4>I really liked him.</v>

3870
01:38:16.440 --> 01:38:17.280
<v Speaker 4>I really don't want to see,</v>

3871
01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:19.050
<v Speaker 4>have that fight where he suddenly old.</v>

3872
01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:21.510
<v Speaker 4>I just hope he gets out before then cause he's looked okay.</v>

3873
01:38:21.511 --> 01:38:23.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's looked good.</v>

3874
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:24.540
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>

3875
01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:25.920
<v Speaker 4>I don't want him to have that fight.</v>

3876
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:26.290
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

3877
01:38:26.290 --> 01:38:27.990
<v Speaker 4>I just really don't want to see it as a,</v>

3878
01:38:27.991 --> 01:38:28.440
<v Speaker 4>as a,</v>

3879
01:38:28.440 --> 01:38:29.273
<v Speaker 4>as a fan.</v>

3880
01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:30.750
<v Speaker 4>I really don't want to see that fight,</v>

3881
01:38:30.751 --> 01:38:30.930
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3882
01:38:30.930 --> 01:38:35.400
<v Speaker 4>Well he's got a chin that's made out of some new kind of metal and it's like</v>

3883
01:38:35.401 --> 01:38:36.870
<v Speaker 4>they don't even know what her in Shit.</v>

3884
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:37.231
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3885
01:38:37.231 --> 01:38:38.310
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

3886
01:38:38.311 --> 01:38:39.750
<v Speaker 4>I never seen a guy take shots.</v>

3887
01:38:39.751 --> 01:38:40.710
<v Speaker 4>Like he takes shots.</v>

3888
01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.440
<v Speaker 4>He's got the best Chin I've ever seen in my life.</v>

3889
01:38:43.830 --> 01:38:44.071
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3890
01:38:44.071 --> 01:38:45.120
<v Speaker 4>I've seen him get rocked.</v>

3891
01:38:45.270 --> 01:38:46.320
<v Speaker 4>Anderson rocked him.</v>

3892
01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:50.220
<v Speaker 4>Anderson lit them up with like a four or five punch combination before he,</v>

3893
01:38:50.221 --> 01:38:50.460
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3894
01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:51.630
<v Speaker 4>Kot him or for you.</v>

3895
01:38:51.631 --> 01:38:52.261
<v Speaker 4>I choked him out.</v>

3896
01:38:52.261 --> 01:38:53.370
<v Speaker 4>Rather he,</v>

3897
01:38:53.371 --> 01:38:56.190
<v Speaker 4>he's the first guy that I've ever seen hurt Dan like that.</v>

3898
01:38:56.191 --> 01:38:58.930
<v Speaker 4>But Dan's been in some crazy ass fucking wars.</v>

3899
01:38:58.950 --> 01:39:02.250
<v Speaker 4>Really tenderly and pride the dog shit out of him.</v>

3900
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.020
<v Speaker 4>And the first fight in the first fight,</v>

3901
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:05.670
<v Speaker 4>the dog shit out of him,</v>

3902
01:39:05.671 --> 01:39:09.200
<v Speaker 4>beat the dog shit out of him going and he fucked Vandelay up to his back.</v>

3903
01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:12.270
<v Speaker 4>That's what Vandelay was just if you just,</v>

3904
01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.850
<v Speaker 4>if you had a steroid test and you brought it near him,</v>

3905
01:39:14.851 --> 01:39:15.684
<v Speaker 4>it would explode.</v>

3906
01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:17.940
<v Speaker 4>It would start shaking in your hands.</v>

3907
01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:20.190
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

3908
01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:21.900
<v Speaker 4>a black hole would be created.</v>

3909
01:39:21.930 --> 01:39:22.111
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3910
01:39:22.111 --> 01:39:22.261
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3911
01:39:22.261 --> 01:39:23.550
<v Speaker 4>cause you're fucking screwed.</v>

3912
01:39:23.551 --> 01:39:24.690
<v Speaker 4>Like a memorex commercial.</v>

3913
01:39:24.691 --> 01:39:25.820
<v Speaker 4>When they yell,</v>

3914
01:39:25.830 --> 01:39:27.560
<v Speaker 4>they sing in the fucking glass break.</v>

3915
01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:30.820
<v Speaker 4>It would just,</v>

3916
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:32.910
<v Speaker 4>it would just fucking explode.</v>

3917
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:37.470
<v Speaker 4>So he got rocked with a big punch and Dan caught him with a huge right hand,</v>

3918
01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:38.520
<v Speaker 4>fucked his eye up.</v>

3919
01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.500
<v Speaker 4>Remember vandelays I was completely caught up.</v>

3920
01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.001
<v Speaker 4>And by the way,</v>

3921
01:39:42.001 --> 01:39:42.601
<v Speaker 4>he was fighting.</v>

3922
01:39:42.601 --> 01:39:44.490
<v Speaker 4>It was like he needed even notice it didn't even care.</v>

3923
01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.353
<v Speaker 4>Didn't even care.</v>

3924
01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:46.950
<v Speaker 4>I don't think enough people,</v>

3925
01:39:47.010 --> 01:39:47.491
<v Speaker 4>and this is,</v>

3926
01:39:47.491 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 4>I really believe this cro cop beat the career out of Vendelay Silva.</v>

3927
01:39:52.290 --> 01:39:56.070
<v Speaker 4>I believe he did shoot him so badly in pride,</v>

3928
01:39:56.071 --> 01:39:57.060
<v Speaker 4>Grand Prix heavyweight.</v>

3929
01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:59.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't think Manderlay was ever the same dude after that.</v>

3930
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:01.400
<v Speaker 4>Beat the career out of them.</v>

3931
01:40:01.401 --> 01:40:03.480
<v Speaker 4>There's that was Vandelay that one fight man.</v>

3932
01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:06.990
<v Speaker 4>Vandelay was trying to fight a 214 pounds again,</v>

3933
01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.100
<v Speaker 4>juice to the Gig.</v>

3934
01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:09.560
<v Speaker 4>No Big Gig kills.</v>

3935
01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.030
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't piss hot.</v>

3936
01:40:12.031 --> 01:40:13.410
<v Speaker 4>He would piss liquid steroid.</v>

3937
01:40:13.411 --> 01:40:14.360
<v Speaker 4>Like you can drink that.</v>

3938
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:16.740
<v Speaker 4>He's gained 10 pounds.</v>

3939
01:40:17.160 --> 01:40:17.881
<v Speaker 4>Get home.</v>

3940
01:40:17.881 --> 01:40:18.241
<v Speaker 4>You'd be like,</v>

3941
01:40:18.241 --> 01:40:19.150
<v Speaker 4>why am I so food?</v>

3942
01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:22.520
<v Speaker 4>You can eat Vander lane dude.</v>

3943
01:40:23.080 --> 01:40:24.540
<v Speaker 4>But his wife was all jacked up.</v>

3944
01:40:24.541 --> 01:40:25.374
<v Speaker 4>She grew up,</v>

3945
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:26.400
<v Speaker 4>she grew a beard.</v>

3946
01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:27.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3947
01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Delay was,</v>

3948
01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.130
<v Speaker 4>was a monster.</v>

3949
01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:30.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was just not afraid of anybody.</v>

3950
01:40:30.601 --> 01:40:31.411
<v Speaker 4>But that was when,</v>

3951
01:40:31.411 --> 01:40:33.030
<v Speaker 4>for those of you who hasn't see it,</v>

3952
01:40:33.031 --> 01:40:33.301
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

3953
01:40:33.301 --> 01:40:33.820
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3954
01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:34.470
<v Speaker 4>it's uh,</v>

3955
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:36.510
<v Speaker 4>an ass whooping from the beginning to end.</v>

3956
01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:38.520
<v Speaker 4>There's an ass scary person back then</v>

3957
01:40:40.830 --> 01:40:43.410
<v Speaker 4>and he fucked Vandelay up before he killed him.</v>

3958
01:40:43.411 --> 01:40:44.090
<v Speaker 4>He had to do,</v>

3959
01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:44.923
<v Speaker 4>was it up?</v>

3960
01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:46.590
<v Speaker 4>He never been the same.</v>

3961
01:40:46.591 --> 01:40:47.400
<v Speaker 4>So good.</v>

3962
01:40:47.400 --> 01:40:48.031
<v Speaker 4>But then again,</v>

3963
01:40:48.031 --> 01:40:49.500
<v Speaker 4>he's another guy will do,</v>

3964
01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:50.071
<v Speaker 4>we're all,</v>

3965
01:40:50.071 --> 01:40:50.904
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

3966
01:40:51.090 --> 01:40:52.590
<v Speaker 4>when you talked to ensign anyway,</v>

3967
01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:55.690
<v Speaker 4>he said had contracts that said they don't test for steroids.</v>

3968
01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:58.390
<v Speaker 4>Like contracts are telling you they're not going to test it with steroids.</v>

3969
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3970
01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 4>You know the ends and laughs about it.</v>

3971
01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:00.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3972
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:04.210
<v Speaker 4>but you look at it didn't give a fuck like cro cop and he comes over to the UFC</v>

3973
01:41:04.211 --> 01:41:05.650
<v Speaker 4>and he's just never the fucking same.</v>

3974
01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Not the same guy.</v>

3975
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:07.931
<v Speaker 4>Everybody goes,</v>

3976
01:41:07.931 --> 01:41:08.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3977
01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:09.310
<v Speaker 4>private photos weren't that good.</v>

3978
01:41:09.311 --> 01:41:11.770
<v Speaker 4>The kiln you'll see him got smoked and I'm like number one,</v>

3979
01:41:11.771 --> 01:41:12.650
<v Speaker 4>a couple of them one bell.</v>

3980
01:41:12.651 --> 01:41:16.270
<v Speaker 4>It's like going to throw on rampage but gee you think I know they were just</v>

3981
01:41:16.271 --> 01:41:19.150
<v Speaker 4>juiced the gills to the gills man.</v>

3982
01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:23.590
<v Speaker 4>And we all know that you can only have so many of those fucking fights.</v>

3983
01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:24.930
<v Speaker 4>The reason they were big in practice,</v>

3984
01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:26.320
<v Speaker 4>he had 20 of you know,</v>

3985
01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:29.770
<v Speaker 4>20 fights against top guys and everybody now is like a pride fan.</v>

3986
01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:31.240
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like cool to be a pride fan.</v>

3987
01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:31.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3988
01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:36.540
<v Speaker 4>They had some freak show fights that made no sense that a lot of,</v>

3989
01:41:37.270 --> 01:41:38.590
<v Speaker 4>I love prime old school pride fan,</v>

3990
01:41:38.591 --> 01:41:40.270
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of those fights were like,</v>

3991
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:41.411
<v Speaker 4>they would throw,</v>

3992
01:41:41.411 --> 01:41:42.190
<v Speaker 4>got member dies,</v>

3993
01:41:42.190 --> 01:41:43.023
<v Speaker 4>you're Matsui.</v>

3994
01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.550
<v Speaker 4>They would just throw him to this.</v>

3995
01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.240
<v Speaker 4>Anybody who was against anybody.</v>

3996
01:41:46.241 --> 01:41:51.241
<v Speaker 4>It's like you can't take that number of beatings or just hard fights period and</v>

3997
01:41:51.291 --> 01:41:52.390
<v Speaker 4>and have a career after that.</v>

3998
01:41:52.391 --> 01:41:53.830
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just Sakuraba.</v>

3999
01:41:54.590 --> 01:41:55.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean that,</v>

4000
01:41:55.090 --> 01:41:57.100
<v Speaker 4>and they gave him no love dude.</v>

4001
01:41:57.101 --> 01:41:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Like after he was,</v>

4002
01:41:58.510 --> 01:41:59.343
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4003
01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:00.061
<v Speaker 4>after,</v>

4004
01:42:00.061 --> 01:42:01.890
<v Speaker 4>basically after he lost the valley's second time,</v>

4005
01:42:01.891 --> 01:42:04.320
<v Speaker 4>it was clear that he was going to be mentally then it was cro cop.</v>

4006
01:42:04.710 --> 01:42:05.101
<v Speaker 4>It was just,</v>

4007
01:42:05.101 --> 01:42:06.540
<v Speaker 4>they never gave the guy a break,</v>

4008
01:42:06.541 --> 01:42:06.840

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:17.840
<v Speaker 1>When does he do it?</v>

4156
01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And I never saw him do that.</v>

4157
01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:19.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4158
01:45:19.381 --> 01:45:20.201
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he still has it.</v>

4159
01:45:20.201 --> 01:45:21.640
<v Speaker 1>I know he's had it before in the past.</v>

4160
01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:23.890
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think about his last fight?</v>

4161
01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:25.660
<v Speaker 1>How do you find that?</v>

4162
01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:26.051
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

4163
01:45:26.051 --> 01:45:26.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4164
01:45:26.770 --> 01:45:27.603

4165
01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Remember?</v>

4166
01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:28.391

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4172

<v Speaker 1>I'll pull it up.</v>

4173
01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:35.633
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4174
01:45:35.710 --> 01:45:36.960
<v Speaker 4>He might retire,</v>

4175
01:45:36.990 --> 01:45:38.760
<v Speaker 4>which sucks because he's got his job broken.</v>

4176
01:45:38.761 --> 01:45:39.180
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

4177
01:45:39.180 --> 01:45:39.740
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4178
01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:41.010

4179
01:45:41.410 --> 01:45:43.250
<v Speaker 4>I love watch that guy fired.</v>

4180
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:44.490
<v Speaker 4>He's exciting.</v>

4181
01:45:44.490 --> 01:45:46.710
<v Speaker 4>You want to talk about God never keeps his fucking hands up.</v>

01:45:48.031 --> 01:45:49.750
<v Speaker 4>So I mean he moved his head real good.</v>

4185
01:45:49.751 --> 01:45:51.150
<v Speaker 4>Good footwork Johnny.</v>

4186
01:45:51.180 --> 01:45:52.290

<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

4191
01:45:56.110 --> 01:45:57.460
<v Speaker 4>His blood running down the side of his face.</v>

4192
01:45:57.490 --> 01:45:57.751
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4193
01:45:57.751 --> 01:45:58.541
<v Speaker 4>It's a good spot though.</v>

4194
01:45:58.541 --> 01:46:00.630
<v Speaker 4>At the top has had corn rows,</v>

4195
01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:04.660
<v Speaker 4>like a fucking white check hanging out with black dudes or in Cabo.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Now here's the thing.</v>

4207
01:46:14.651 --> 01:46:16.330
<v Speaker 4>It's something that Abella Tor is doing good.</v>

4208
01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:19.090
<v Speaker 4>I like that new glove that you guys have other than Jimmy Smith.</v>

4209
01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:19.850

01:46:21.471 --> 01:46:22.304
<v Speaker 4>That's the main thing.</v>

4213

4215
01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:27.770
<v Speaker 4>that guy works with questionable</v>

4216
01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.011
<v Speaker 4>at the gloves,</v>

4217
01:46:31.011 --> 01:46:33.240
<v Speaker 4>those new Everlast gloves that are are,</v>

4218
01:46:33.250 --> 01:46:36.050
<v Speaker 4>they protect the hand bore and they're more curved.</v>

4219
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.831
<v Speaker 4>The other kind of bent.</v>

4220
01:46:36.831 --> 01:46:37.461
<v Speaker 4>If you haven't seen them,</v>

4221
01:46:37.461 --> 01:46:39.440
<v Speaker 4>they're kind of like make a hand couple of them I would.</v>

4222
01:46:39.441 --> 01:46:39.711
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

4223
01:46:39.711 --> 01:46:40.730
<v Speaker 4>Like some more hand protection.</v>

4224
01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:41.511
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4225
01:46:41.511 --> 01:46:41.770
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

4226
01:46:41.770 --> 01:46:42.603
<v Speaker 1>I know you use,</v>

4227
01:46:42.650 --> 01:46:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Dean's got a fucked up hand right now.</v>

4228
01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.850
<v Speaker 1>How many times he had hand surgery twice.</v>

4229
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Brett's</v>

4230
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.480
<v Speaker 2>a two surgeries.</v>

4231
01:46:51.481 --> 01:46:52.314
<v Speaker 2>Two breaks.</v>

4232
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:54.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4233
01:46:54.180 --> 01:46:54.870
<v Speaker 2>and it's just,</v>

4234
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:56.100
<v Speaker 2>I mean it will break again.</v>

4235
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:58.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just one of those things you say too hard son.</v>

4236
01:46:59.080 --> 01:46:59.913
<v Speaker 2>Got a problem.</v>

4237
01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:01.981
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4238
01:47:01.981 --> 01:47:02.814
<v Speaker 2>People in the top of that,</v>

4239
01:47:03.010 --> 01:47:04.620
<v Speaker 2>that's a problem as the killer.</v>

4240
01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:07.860
<v Speaker 2>This a good straight lamp by for that.</v>

4241
01:47:07.861 --> 01:47:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4242
01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:09.570
<v Speaker 2>the Everlast glove,</v>

4243
01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:12.420
<v Speaker 2>they've had very few handbrakes in Beltour since,</v>

4244
01:47:12.630 --> 01:47:13.800
<v Speaker 2>since that was implemented.</v>

4245
01:47:13.801 --> 01:47:14.220
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4246
01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:15.180
<v Speaker 2>What was the statistic?</v>

4247
01:47:15.181 --> 01:47:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>

4248
01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:16.830
<v Speaker 2>you're the guy over there.</v>

4249
01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I am the guy over there.</v>

4250
01:47:17.970 --> 01:47:18.661
<v Speaker 2>What are the numbers,</v>

4251
01:47:18.661 --> 01:47:19.494
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>

4252
01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:20.740
<v Speaker 2>for the amperage?</v>

4253
01:47:22.070 --> 01:47:22.441
<v Speaker 2>Six.</v>

4254
01:47:22.441 --> 01:47:23.240
<v Speaker 2>About what?</v>

4255
01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:23.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4256
01:47:23.550 --> 01:47:24.510
<v Speaker 2>what's your specific question?</v>

4257
01:47:24.860 --> 01:47:25.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4258
01:47:25.201 --> 01:47:26.220
<v Speaker 2>there was a bunch of them.</v>

4259
01:47:26.221 --> 01:47:27.150
<v Speaker 2>There was a statistic.</v>

4260
01:47:27.151 --> 01:47:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Look how small retort Belfort's aren't looks.</v>

4261
01:47:29.281 --> 01:47:29.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4262
01:47:29.500 --> 01:47:30.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be the guy saying that,</v>

4263
01:47:32.370 --> 01:47:33.960
<v Speaker 2>just throwing that out there that</v>

4264
01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:37.200
<v Speaker 2>get rid of that guys,</v>

4265
01:47:37.770 --> 01:47:38.640
<v Speaker 2>they're heard us in the truck.</v>

4266
01:47:39.190 --> 01:47:40.023
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4267
01:47:40.050 --> 01:47:43.830
<v Speaker 2>I know that there was like a ton of handbrakes one season,</v>

4268
01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:46.740
<v Speaker 2>the season before the implementation of these gloves.</v>

4269
01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:48.450
<v Speaker 2>And since then I don't think there's been a break.</v>

4270
01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:49.410
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen one.</v>

4271
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.491
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

4272
01:47:50.491 --> 01:47:50.791
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4273
01:47:50.791 --> 01:47:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I think they've like literally eliminated handbrakes which is,</v>

4274
01:47:53.730 --> 01:47:55.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's kind of anecdotal.</v>

4275
01:47:55.591 --> 01:47:56.460
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a,</v>

4276
01:47:56.530 --> 01:47:57.330
<v Speaker 2>well the problem,</v>

4277
01:47:57.330 --> 01:47:58.660
<v Speaker 2>the problem they've hadn't belter and,</v>

4278
01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:00.790
<v Speaker 2>and obviously it's,</v>

4279
01:48:00.791 --> 01:48:02.430
<v Speaker 2>it's going to change next year as well.</v>

4280
01:48:02.431 --> 01:48:04.740
<v Speaker 2>The tournament system guy would get his hand broken and that was it.</v>

4281
01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:06.470
<v Speaker 2>We had thrown somebody out like an injury.</v>

4282
01:48:06.471 --> 01:48:06.811
<v Speaker 2>We would go,</v>

4283
01:48:06.811 --> 01:48:07.081
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

4284
01:48:07.081 --> 01:48:09.000
<v Speaker 2>well he won't fight for four months anyway.</v>

4285
01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Now he's got to find a month.</v>

4286
01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4287
01:48:10.830 --> 01:48:13.170
<v Speaker 2>So that's why they don't allow elbows on the ground.</v>

4288
01:48:13.171 --> 01:48:14.004
<v Speaker 2>It's because,</v>

4289
01:48:14.400 --> 01:48:15.270
<v Speaker 2>or the LLS period,</v>

4290
01:48:15.271 --> 01:48:17.460
<v Speaker 2>it's because they didn't want cuts where you get a 60 day suspension,</v>

4291
01:48:17.490 --> 01:48:18.660
<v Speaker 2>you can't fight the next month.</v>

4292
01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:21.220
<v Speaker 2>So that would really fuck belts were up.</v>

4293
01:48:21.221 --> 01:48:22.140
<v Speaker 2>So when people got injured,</v>

4294
01:48:22.610 --> 01:48:23.401
<v Speaker 2>fight in a month,</v>

4295
01:48:23.401 --> 01:48:23.981
<v Speaker 2>you've got a broken hand,</v>

4296
01:48:23.981 --> 01:48:24.271
<v Speaker 2>you don,</v>

4297
01:48:24.271 --> 01:48:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's just,</v>

4298
01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.673
<v Speaker 2>you gotta replace them.</v>

4299
01:48:25.980 --> 01:48:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that they're going to change that fight in a month?</v>

4300
01:48:29.011 --> 01:48:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Thing with coke involved?</v>

4301
01:48:30.150 --> 01:48:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think that they're getting rid of the tournament,</v>

4302
01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:32.850
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

4303
01:48:32.850 --> 01:48:33.240
<v Speaker 2>Thing.</v>

4304
01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4305
01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:34.650
<v Speaker 2>They uh,</v>

4306
01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:39.830
<v Speaker 2>the seasonal format where we're doing a fight a week for three months is going</v>

4307
01:48:39.831 --> 01:48:40.500
<v Speaker 2>to go,</v>

4308
01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:41.333
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4309
01:48:41.490 --> 01:48:45.780
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're talking about because essentially a one time until the</v>

4310
01:48:45.781 --> 01:48:46.201
<v Speaker 2>story,</v>

4311
01:48:46.201 --> 01:48:49.590
<v Speaker 2>a Marinello used to call me every week to do when he was on the score and radio</v>

4312
01:48:49.591 --> 01:48:52.830
<v Speaker 2>show or whatever and to kind of break down next week's bell torn one time.</v>

4313
01:48:52.831 --> 01:48:53.664
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

4314
01:48:54.050 --> 01:48:54.481
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

4315
01:48:54.481 --> 01:48:55.231
<v Speaker 2>well in three weeks.</v>

4316
01:48:55.231 --> 01:48:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And I went,</v>

4317
01:48:56.040 --> 01:48:56.671
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

4318
01:48:56.671 --> 01:48:56.971
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

4319
01:48:56.971 --> 01:48:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's happening in three weeks.</v>

4320
01:48:58.380 --> 01:49:00.970
<v Speaker 2>Like that's like a year to me,</v>

4321
01:49:00.971 --> 01:49:01.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4322
01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:02.610
<v Speaker 2>that's like four or five years from now.</v>

4323
01:49:02.611 --> 01:49:06.090
<v Speaker 2>So I like running my computer and like pull it up real quick so I can talk about</v>

4324
01:49:06.091 --> 01:49:06.630
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

4325
01:49:06.630 --> 01:49:09.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what's happening in two weeks or three weeks.</v>

4326
01:49:09.180 --> 01:49:09.820
<v Speaker 2>How has,</v>

4327
01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:11.040
<v Speaker 2>how have the fans get to know what's happening?</v>

4328
01:49:11.070 --> 01:49:14.010
<v Speaker 2>We like you couldn't build up a fight because we had a fight every week.</v>

4329
01:49:14.190 --> 01:49:15.360
<v Speaker 2>So unless you were like in it,</v>

4330
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:17.040
<v Speaker 2>cause you like watching fights every week.</v>

4331
01:49:17.041 --> 01:49:17.880
<v Speaker 2>We did have those fans that,</v>

4332
01:49:17.881 --> 01:49:18.780
<v Speaker 2>that got into it.</v>

4333
01:49:18.781 --> 01:49:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Like you get into a,</v>

4334
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:20.790
<v Speaker 2>to these TV series.</v>

4335
01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.210
<v Speaker 2>It was hard to hype a fight and make a fight really big.</v>

4336
01:49:24.211 --> 01:49:24.991
<v Speaker 2>And Scott Coker,</v>

4337
01:49:24.991 --> 01:49:29.160
<v Speaker 2>his whole thing now is big fights and you need lead time and you need</v>

4338
01:49:29.161 --> 01:49:30.750
<v Speaker 2>promotional time to build those up.</v>

4339
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4340
01:49:31.050 --> 01:49:32.190
<v Speaker 2>It can't be done every week.</v>

4341
01:49:32.191 --> 01:49:33.024
<v Speaker 2>So by the way,</v>

4342
01:49:33.150 --> 01:49:34.920
<v Speaker 2>nobody gives a fuck about tournaments.</v>

4343
01:49:34.921 --> 01:49:35.754
<v Speaker 2>They like,</v>

4344
01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:36.873
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>

4345
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.500
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

4346
01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:38.760
<v Speaker 2>here's the statistics.</v>

4347
01:49:38.761 --> 01:49:39.151
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

4348
01:49:39.151 --> 01:49:39.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4349
01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:44.780
<v Speaker 2>the new gloves debuted at Beltour one 10 and Bella Torah has held nine events</v>

4350
01:49:45.391 --> 01:49:47.620
<v Speaker 2>and experiences zero handbrakes</v>

4351
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:48.761
<v Speaker 4>since uh,</v>

4352
01:49:48.761 --> 01:49:50.470
<v Speaker 4>the implementation of the new drug.</v>

4353
01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:52.480
<v Speaker 4>New gloves by comparison,</v>

4354
01:49:52.650 --> 01:49:55.030
<v Speaker 4>Bella tour season eight saw 11 events.</v>

4355
01:49:55.031 --> 01:49:59.560
<v Speaker 4>You'd the old use the old glove design and included eight broken hands,</v>

4356
01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:02.050
<v Speaker 4>including welterweight champion,</v>

4357
01:50:02.051 --> 01:50:02.890
<v Speaker 4>Douglas Lema,</v>

4358
01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:03.940
<v Speaker 4>a beast,</v>

4359
01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:07.690
<v Speaker 4>a dude's a monster and a lightweight standouts.</v>

4360
01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:09.320
<v Speaker 4>Assad a wad is that I say this,</v>

4361
01:50:09.330 --> 01:50:14.330
<v Speaker 4>I had a one side a wad and broke it against Dave Rickles and Alexander</v>

4362
01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Karnofsky.</v>

4363
01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:15.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4364
01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 4>All broke their hand.</v>

4365
01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:17.440
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4366
01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.610
<v Speaker 4>Imagine amazing man.</v>

4367
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.863
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

4368
01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:20.883
<v Speaker 4>I remember those fights.</v>

4369
01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:27.120
<v Speaker 4>Season nine also featured 11 events and had seven fighters suffer breaks.</v>

4370
01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:32.683
<v Speaker 8>Hold on a second.</v>

4371
01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:34.613
<v Speaker 4>Season Eight.</v>

4372
01:50:34.630 --> 01:50:34.901
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4373
01:50:34.901 --> 01:50:35.620
<v Speaker 4>This is,</v>

4374
01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:36.131
<v Speaker 4>this is thing.</v>

4375
01:50:36.131 --> 01:50:40.630
<v Speaker 4>Season eight had the new gloves and Oh,</v>

4376
01:50:40.631 --> 01:50:42.100
<v Speaker 4>they had eight broken hands.</v>

4377
01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:42.941
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4378
01:50:42.941 --> 01:50:43.774
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second.</v>

4379
01:50:45.130 --> 01:50:45.611
<v Speaker 4>Wait a second.</v>

4380
01:50:45.611 --> 01:50:46.630
<v Speaker 4>Since the new glove,</v>

4381
01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:48.100
<v Speaker 4>they've held nine events.</v>

4382
01:50:49.150 --> 01:50:49.580
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

4383
01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:53.890
<v Speaker 4>Bellator season eight saw 11 events with the old gloves to,</v>

4384
01:50:53.891 --> 01:50:56.530
<v Speaker 4>to deny your understanding that the confusion of the season format.</v>

4385
01:50:56.531 --> 01:50:57.191
<v Speaker 4>Now right here,</v>

4386
01:50:57.191 --> 01:50:57.431
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

4387
01:50:57.431 --> 01:50:59.900
<v Speaker 4>is just simplifying that.</v>

4388
01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:01.920
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

4389
01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:05.010
<v Speaker 4>Well apparently they haven't had Henny handbrakes since the new gloves.</v>

4390
01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:05.810
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>

4391
01:51:05.810 --> 01:51:06.481
<v Speaker 4>We haven't any sense.</v>

4392
01:51:06.481 --> 01:51:07.140
<v Speaker 4>They had the new one.</v>

4393
01:51:07.140 --> 01:51:07.980
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

4394
01:51:08.130 --> 01:51:08.780
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty cool.</v>

4395
01:51:08.780 --> 01:51:09.630
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty amazing.</v>

4396
01:51:10.410 --> 01:51:12.210
<v Speaker 4>So if you see the gloves,</v>

4397
01:51:12.270 --> 01:51:12.781
<v Speaker 4>you see them,</v>

4398
01:51:12.781 --> 01:51:13.140
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4399
01:51:13.140 --> 01:51:13.973
<v Speaker 4>in an image,</v>

4400
01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:14.813
<v Speaker 4>you can see him here.</v>

4401
01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:17.490
<v Speaker 4>The comparison between the old gloves and the new gloves,</v>

4402
01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:18.353
<v Speaker 4>they're just thicker,</v>

4403
01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:19.313
<v Speaker 4>thicker on top.</v>

4404
01:51:19.410 --> 01:51:20.220
<v Speaker 4>And not an Eli,</v>

4405
01:51:20.220 --> 01:51:20.941
<v Speaker 4>not any heavier.</v>

4406
01:51:20.941 --> 01:51:21.200
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4407
01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.110
<v Speaker 4>It's still four ounce gloves.</v>

4408
01:51:22.170 --> 01:51:23.003
<v Speaker 4>Listen.</v>

4409
01:51:23.150 --> 01:51:23.431

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4424
01:51:43.941 --> 01:51:48.140
<v Speaker 4>north of 200 it's well north of a perfect example of a guy who diminished by</v>

4425
01:51:48.141 --> 01:51:48.974
<v Speaker 4>losing weight.</v>

4426

01:51:51.141 --> 01:51:52.310
<v Speaker 4>He's the best example.</v>

4429
01:51:52.330 --> 01:51:52.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4430
01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:55.700
<v Speaker 4>look at what the fuck that guy looks like as a light heavyweight.</v>

4431
01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:58.700
<v Speaker 4>He's gotta be kicking himself for not being a light heavyweight all along.</v>

4432
01:51:58.730 --> 01:52:02.420
<v Speaker 4>He's a scary having full energy and full what he did.</v>

4433
01:52:02.421 --> 01:52:03.200
<v Speaker 4>Phil Davis,</v>

4434
01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:04.340
<v Speaker 4>nobody's done the Phil Davis.</v>

4435
01:52:04.400 --> 01:52:05.480
<v Speaker 4>He manhandled him,</v>

4436
01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:06.493
<v Speaker 4>handled them,</v>

4437
01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:08.120
<v Speaker 4>stuffed every takedown.</v>

4438
01:52:08.150 --> 01:52:09.170
<v Speaker 4>Like it was a joke.</v>

4439
01:52:09.171 --> 01:52:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Beat the shit out of him standing,</v>

4440
01:52:11.010 --> 01:52:12.600
<v Speaker 4>made it look like he didn't belong in there with them.</v>

4441
01:52:12.601 --> 01:52:13.490
<v Speaker 4>It was amazing.</v>

4442
01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:14.373
<v Speaker 4>I can</v>

4443
01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:18.740
<v Speaker 4>power wise what were shot beat Phil Davis,</v>

4444
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:21.500
<v Speaker 4>but physically didn't do it like that.</v>

4445
01:52:21.501 --> 01:52:22.041
<v Speaker 4>The floor with them.</v>

4446
01:52:22.041 --> 01:52:22.940
<v Speaker 4>Didn't do it like that.</v>

4447
01:52:22.970 --> 01:52:25.040
<v Speaker 4>Anthony Rumble Johnson is fucking frightening.</v>

4448
01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4449
01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:26.833
<v Speaker 4>It's a scary dude.</v>

4450
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:31.730
<v Speaker 4>So Andrew Craig and [inaudible] here in the second round.</v>

4451
01:52:37.230 --> 01:52:37.741
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

4452
01:52:37.741 --> 01:52:38.760
<v Speaker 4>Ferrara did a,</v>

4453
01:52:38.761 --> 01:52:39.900
<v Speaker 4>he lost his last fight.</v>

4454
01:52:41.320 --> 01:52:42.260
<v Speaker 4>That was a,</v>

4455
01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:43.090
<v Speaker 4>the doll with Hud.</v>

4456
01:52:43.090 --> 01:52:43.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4457
01:52:43.331 --> 01:52:44.350
<v Speaker 4>That was the doorway fight,</v>

4458
01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:50.960
<v Speaker 4>which was a great fight for,</v>

4459
01:52:50.961 --> 01:52:51.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4460
01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:52.573
<v Speaker 4>for Dalloway.</v>

4461
01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:55.190
<v Speaker 4>Dollo is another one of those guys that are really is coming into his own</v>

4462
01:52:55.191 --> 01:52:55.990
<v Speaker 4>lately.</v>

4463
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.960
<v Speaker 4>He just starting to see it.</v>

4464
01:53:01.230 --> 01:53:05.590
<v Speaker 4>Dalloway is just starting to get real comfortable with his hands were loose with</v>

4465
01:53:05.591 --> 01:53:06.424
<v Speaker 4>his hands</v>

4466
01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:10.510
<v Speaker 4>spinning back fist.</v>

4467
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:14.760
<v Speaker 4>It's interesting how you're seeing,</v>

4468
01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:15.960
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4469
01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:18.240
<v Speaker 4>like we were talking about this the other day,</v>

4470
01:53:18.241 --> 01:53:20.100
<v Speaker 4>that MMA has a lot of,</v>

4471
01:53:20.101 --> 01:53:20.311
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

4472
01:53:20.311 --> 01:53:22.890
<v Speaker 4>one guy will do one thing and you'll see it happen.</v>

4473
01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:24.870
<v Speaker 4>You'll see it'd be effective,</v>

4474
01:53:24.871 --> 01:53:25.561
<v Speaker 4>like a wheel kick.</v>

4475
01:53:25.561 --> 01:53:26.980
<v Speaker 4>And then you'll see like everybody throwing wheels.</v>

4476
01:53:27.010 --> 01:53:27.843
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's trying it.</v>

4477
01:53:27.960 --> 01:53:28.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4478
01:53:28.590 --> 01:53:29.460
<v Speaker 4>It's one of those things,</v>

4479
01:53:29.490 --> 01:53:31.650
<v Speaker 4>we'll get this holy Shantay strong as fuck.</v>

4480
01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:33.840
<v Speaker 4>Good takedown defense by Craig though.</v>

4481
01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:36.360
<v Speaker 4>Andrew Craig's a really good athlete,</v>

4482
01:53:36.361 --> 01:53:37.194
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

4483
01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:40.700
<v Speaker 4>And the reason why he's gotten so good at MMA so quickly,</v>

4484
01:53:48.650 --> 01:53:48.990
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

4485
01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:49.571
<v Speaker 4>it's not the,</v>

4486
01:53:49.571 --> 01:53:49.990
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4487
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:53.110
<v Speaker 4>technique anymore is the x factor is how good of an athlete are there.</v>

4488
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:54.850
<v Speaker 4>That's definitely a part of it,</v>

4489
01:53:54.851 --> 01:53:55.151
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

4490
01:53:55.151 --> 01:53:55.331
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4491
01:53:55.331 --> 01:53:57.990
<v Speaker 4>Marcello Garcia has always said that about no Jujitsu,</v>

4492
01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:02.050
<v Speaker 4>that the difference she know g and g is that physical attributes are so much</v>

4493
01:54:02.051 --> 01:54:03.100
<v Speaker 4>more important and no gay.</v>

4494
01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:04.900
<v Speaker 4>That a guy who was really physically strong,</v>

4495
01:54:04.901 --> 01:54:06.310
<v Speaker 4>it counts for so much more.</v>

4496
01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:08.610
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the guys physically strong and a g,</v>

4497
01:54:09.010 --> 01:54:09.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4498
01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:09.810
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

4499
01:54:09.810 --> 01:54:10.030
<v Speaker 4>we've,</v>

4500
01:54:10.030 --> 01:54:12.820
<v Speaker 4>we've all seen it guys get wrapped up in spider webbed,</v>

4501
01:54:13.210 --> 01:54:13.421
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4502
01:54:13.421 --> 01:54:14.950
<v Speaker 4>they just get gummed up.</v>

4503
01:54:15.130 --> 01:54:16.570
<v Speaker 4>Ted Today took second in the world.</v>

4504
01:54:16.571 --> 01:54:18.100
<v Speaker 4>That heavyweight did.</v>

4505
01:54:18.101 --> 01:54:19.930
<v Speaker 4>He really had heavyweight lost too.</v>

4506
01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:22.510
<v Speaker 4>Fibery silver dome on points.</v>

4507
01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:23.320
<v Speaker 4>That's incredible.</v>

4508
01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:25.630
<v Speaker 4>Heavyweight and heavyweight [inaudible] obviously.</v>

4509
01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:26.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4510
01:54:26.050 --> 01:54:27.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's how good ted today was.</v>

4511
01:54:27.521 --> 01:54:29.680
<v Speaker 4>I mean this guy fought for the non Jujitsu people,</v>

4512
01:54:29.681 --> 01:54:31.300
<v Speaker 4>fought around 170 pounds.</v>

4513
01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:32.170
<v Speaker 4>Schooled Marcel,</v>

4514
01:54:32.170 --> 01:54:32.921
<v Speaker 4>see you in the world,</v>

4515
01:54:32.921 --> 01:54:34.180
<v Speaker 4>I think 2003 2004</v>

4516
01:54:36.490 --> 01:54:37.090
<v Speaker 4>with a geek.</v>

4517
01:54:37.090 --> 01:54:38.770
<v Speaker 4>So that's a perfect example is the guy,</v>

4518
01:54:38.771 --> 01:54:38.891
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4519
01:54:38.891 --> 01:54:41.530
<v Speaker 4>I've seen Jeff Glover school heavyweights with a g,</v>

4520
01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:42.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4521
01:54:42.530 --> 01:54:45.130
<v Speaker 4>but anything Mary g off man.</v>

4522
01:54:45.370 --> 01:54:45.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4523
01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:47.500
<v Speaker 4>That's why a lot of guys like Charlie,</v>

4524
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:48.370
<v Speaker 4>you own the Geeky make,</v>

4526
01:54:50.141 --> 01:54:53.560
<v Speaker 4>You know you're going to train for MMA but you'll learn train negi why they want</v>

4527
01:54:53.561 --> 01:54:53.881
<v Speaker 4>to do that.</v>

4528
01:54:53.881 --> 01:54:56.860
<v Speaker 4>Cause when they roll with you they get still wrap you up in Brazilian Jujitsu.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's not bad.</v>

4531
01:54:59.650 --> 01:55:00.790
<v Speaker 4>My friend Nova is normal.</v>

4532
01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I've been around,</v>

4533
01:55:01.811 --> 01:55:02.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4534
01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:04.000
<v Speaker 4>do this guy with these guys.</v>

4535
01:55:04.001 --> 01:55:04.301
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4536
01:55:04.301 --> 01:55:06.130
<v Speaker 4>Jujitsu is very good.</v>

4537
01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:07.113
<v Speaker 4>Very true.</v>

4538
01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:08.690
<v Speaker 4>Stays Ferrara.</v>

4539
01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:14.310
<v Speaker 4>We'll we'll kick that was like the company talks about it,</v>

4540
01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:17.010
<v Speaker 4>dropped down and put his hands on the ground and everything.</v>

4541
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:23.280
<v Speaker 4>Andrew Craig looks a very v for vendetta.</v>

4542
01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:24.473
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

4543
01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:27.540
<v Speaker 4>He's doing the wrong thing though,</v>

4544
01:55:27.541 --> 01:55:29.490
<v Speaker 4>is when for us throwing the wild techniques,</v>

4545
01:55:29.491 --> 01:55:30.324
<v Speaker 4>he's freezing.</v>

4546
01:55:30.450 --> 01:55:31.880
<v Speaker 4>Craig's kind of looking at it right now.</v>

4547
01:55:31.950 --> 01:55:33.300
<v Speaker 4>That's the time to get on the guy,</v>

4548
01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:34.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4549
01:55:34.081 --> 01:55:35.250
<v Speaker 4>but straight shots,</v>

4550
01:55:35.580 --> 01:55:38.700
<v Speaker 4>straight shots and right now he's seeing the funky techniques and freezing.</v>

4551
01:55:39.190 --> 01:55:39.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4552
01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:40.243
<v Speaker 4>Looking at it.</v>

4553
01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:41.420
<v Speaker 4>He's still got a lot of,</v>

4554
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:43.500
<v Speaker 4>a lot of growing to do know.</v>

4555
01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:45.231
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>

4556
01:55:45.231 --> 01:55:49.560
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for a guy who's getting into MMA late in life with no expertise in</v>

4557
01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:50.190
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

4558
01:55:50.190 --> 01:55:50.690
<v Speaker 4>It's one,</v>

4559
01:55:50.690 --> 01:55:52.380
<v Speaker 4>one thing if you're like a cro cop guy,</v>

4560
01:55:52.381 --> 01:55:55.320
<v Speaker 4>there was a high level kickboxer enters into MMA and then you,</v>

4561
01:55:55.321 --> 01:55:55.540
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

4562
01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:56.640
<v Speaker 4>we get to watch the,</v>

4563
01:55:56.641 --> 01:55:57.510
<v Speaker 4>the transition.</v>

4564
01:55:59.190 --> 01:56:02.970
<v Speaker 4>But these guys that are learning everything as they go along.</v>

4565
01:56:04.130 --> 01:56:04.910
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

4566
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:07.040
<v Speaker 4>Do you think he could a data girl like Rhonda Rousey,</v>

4567
01:56:07.041 --> 01:56:07.521
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Smith,</v>

4568
01:56:07.521 --> 01:56:08.870
<v Speaker 4>if you were a single guy date,</v>

4569
01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:10.321

4570
01:56:10.321 --> 01:56:11.700
<v Speaker 2>let's use some word finishes here.</v>

4571
01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:13.010
<v Speaker 2>I use the word date.</v>

4572
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:15.480
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people were being nice or being nice here.</v>

4573
01:56:15.870 --> 01:56:16.441
<v Speaker 2>Could I date?</v>

4574
01:56:16.441 --> 01:56:16.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4575
01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:17.341
<v Speaker 2>Could you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>could that be your girlfriend?</v>

4578
01:56:18.710 --> 01:56:21.090
<v Speaker 2>They can handle that crazy.</v>

4579
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

4580
01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.021
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4581
01:56:22.021 --> 01:56:25.380
<v Speaker 2>it's weird because I tend to attract a lot of crazy women.</v>

4582
01:56:25.740 --> 01:56:26.573
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4583
01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:27.350

01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:27.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4585
01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:28.231

4632
01:57:36.080 --> 01:57:37.580
<v Speaker 2>Pretty much just wrestlers did that.</v>

4633
01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Now everybody does it.</v>

4634
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.321
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

4635
01:57:39.321 --> 01:57:44.321
<v Speaker 4>Andrew Craig is a mask of blood that is bad and it's right over the eye,</v>

4636
01:57:44.721 --> 01:57:46.940
<v Speaker 4>which is a bad place to get good irrigated.</v>

4637
01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:48.350
<v Speaker 4>He's trying to get back up</v>

4638
01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.820
<v Speaker 4>and say's there's got his back now defend that left hook.</v>

4639
01:57:52.850 --> 01:57:53.690
<v Speaker 4>Oh son,</v>

4640
01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I never have some ask you.</v>

4641
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:58.400
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had a cut roughly that nasty in a fight?</v>

4642
01:57:58.570 --> 01:57:59.403
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4643
01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:00.070
<v Speaker 4>Never.</v>

4644
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.610
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

4645
01:58:00.610 --> 01:58:02.680
<v Speaker 4>I was always wondering if there's just,</v>

4646
01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:06.060
<v Speaker 2>cause it never really bothered me getting hit and I never really got cut that</v>

4647
01:58:06.061 --> 01:58:06.894
<v Speaker 2>bad.</v>

4648
01:58:07.170 --> 01:58:09.270
<v Speaker 2>But you see it cause you don't see what we're seeing.</v>

4649
01:58:09.271 --> 01:58:10.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't know where it is.</v>

4650
01:58:10.111 --> 01:58:11.970
<v Speaker 2>You don't know exactly how deep it is.</v>

4651
01:58:11.971 --> 01:58:12.601
<v Speaker 2>You can't see it.</v>

4652
01:58:12.601 --> 01:58:14.640
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly my eyes are full of blood.</v>

4653
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:16.500
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

4654
01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:17.580
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be a moment you go,</v>

4655
01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:18.423
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

4656
01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:20.130
<v Speaker 2>That is a gap because that's a battle.</v>

4657
01:58:20.131 --> 01:58:21.140
<v Speaker 2>Cause you don't know how bad it is.</v>

4658
01:58:21.150 --> 01:58:23.820
<v Speaker 2>One time I still have stitches in my eye in practice.</v>

4659
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:24.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4660
01:58:24.241 --> 01:58:25.350
<v Speaker 2>But I just Bam.</v>

4661
01:58:25.351 --> 01:58:27.660
<v Speaker 2>And then we're looking at the ceiling just like,</v>

4662
01:58:27.690 --> 01:58:28.360
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

4663
01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:28.511
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

4664
01:58:28.511 --> 01:58:30.060
<v Speaker 2>all I heard was had Chris,</v>

4665
01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:31.621
<v Speaker 2>this kid,</v>

4666
01:58:31.621 --> 01:58:32.940
<v Speaker 2>this Japanese kid is just,</v>

4667
01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:34.380
<v Speaker 2>it was freaky athlete.</v>

4668
01:58:34.381 --> 01:58:34.561
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

4669
01:58:34.561 --> 01:58:35.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4670
01:58:35.150 --> 01:58:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Just jump knee me in the face when I was shooting and just last in my eye open.</v>

4671
01:58:39.991 --> 01:58:40.710
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

4672
01:58:40.710 --> 01:58:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprised it hasn't,</v>

4673
01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:42.310
<v Speaker 2>doesn't open.</v>

4674
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:43.180
<v Speaker 4>It's still got stitches in it.</v>

4675
01:58:43.181 --> 01:58:43.900
<v Speaker 4>You can feel them.</v>

4676
01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:45.730
<v Speaker 4>So they did dissolve and it's one of those,</v>

4677
01:58:45.731 --> 01:58:46.031
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4678
01:58:46.031 --> 01:58:47.110
<v Speaker 4>this was the long time ago.</v>

4679
01:58:47.170 --> 01:58:48.490
<v Speaker 4>They were just never gonna pull out.</v>

4680
01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:49.180
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4681
01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:50.590
<v Speaker 4>I guess I'm supposed to do that.</v>

4682
01:58:50.740 --> 01:58:51.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4683
01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:51.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4684
01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:52.301
<v Speaker 4>That sounds good.</v>

4685
01:58:52.301 --> 01:58:53.830
<v Speaker 4>It was cause I was fighting soon.</v>

4686
01:58:53.831 --> 01:58:55.330
<v Speaker 4>And then this is left tomorrow.</v>

4687
01:58:55.390 --> 01:58:56.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4688
01:58:56.170 --> 01:58:56.591
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

4689
01:58:56.591 --> 01:58:56.810
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

4690
01:58:56.810 --> 01:58:57.700
<v Speaker 4>it's got a nice run naked,</v>

4691
01:58:57.701 --> 01:59:00.690
<v Speaker 4>but he can extend his back because he's up against the cage.</v>

4692
01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:01.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4693
01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.110
<v Speaker 4>that's a real problem.</v>

4694
01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:02.971
<v Speaker 4>But his hips into it.</v>

4695
01:59:02.971 --> 01:59:03.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4696
01:59:03.190 --> 01:59:04.360
<v Speaker 4>That's the benefit of the,</v>

4697
01:59:04.361 --> 01:59:05.194
<v Speaker 4>the ring.</v>

4698
01:59:05.710 --> 01:59:06.430
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

4699
01:59:06.430 --> 01:59:07.263
<v Speaker 4>now he's got it.</v>

4700
01:59:07.930 --> 01:59:08.741
<v Speaker 4>Now I might be in trouble.</v>

4701
01:59:08.741 --> 01:59:09.574
<v Speaker 4>I can extend.</v>

4702
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:10.241
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

4703
01:59:10.241 --> 01:59:11.950
<v Speaker 4>Andrew's actually scooting back.</v>

4704
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:15.950
<v Speaker 4>That body triangle sucks.</v>

4705
01:59:15.951 --> 01:59:16.611

4709
01:59:18.171 --> 01:59:18.790
<v Speaker 4>I had me on.</v>

4710
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:20.750
<v Speaker 4>They had me with that for the first round of our fight.</v>

4711
01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:22.130
<v Speaker 4>Worst feeling and he just,</v>

4712

4713
01:59:23.540 --> 01:59:24.560
<v Speaker 4>I kept was impossible.</v>

4714
01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:27.050
<v Speaker 4>The worst is when a guy's got your back and your belly down.</v>

4715
01:59:27.290 --> 01:59:28.730
<v Speaker 4>That body triangle is locked in.</v>

4716

4723
01:59:37.051 --> 01:59:37.884
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4724

4736
01:59:56.661 --> 01:59:57.590

<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>

4739
01:59:58.970 --> 02:00:02.210
<v Speaker 2>Dennett Dennett part willing over the garden.</v>

4740
02:00:02.211 --> 02:00:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>

4741
02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:05.590
<v Speaker 4>That was a fight that I was bummed out when he fought gummy and pride and he</v>

4742
02:00:05.591 --> 02:00:06.430
<v Speaker 4>came out with his leg.</v>

4743
02:00:06.431 --> 02:00:08.650
<v Speaker 4>All Mama fucked up and you knew he was fucked up.</v>

4744
02:00:08.950 --> 02:00:10.870
<v Speaker 4>He knew he was injured going into that fight</v>

4745
02:00:11.120 --> 02:00:13.100
<v Speaker 2>and he always got screwed at the head and arm throw.</v>

4746
02:00:13.101 --> 02:00:15.050
<v Speaker 2>He try and it like innocent Sylvia,</v>

4747
02:00:15.051 --> 02:00:15.920
<v Speaker 2>if you slip,</v>

4748
02:00:16.100 --> 02:00:18.830
<v Speaker 2>you get your back taken and you did that against Gomi did that again.</v>

4749
02:00:18.831 --> 02:00:19.270
<v Speaker 2>Silva,</v>

4750
02:00:19.270 --> 02:00:19.840
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>

4751
02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:22.360
<v Speaker 4>The Japanese use that they go out there to die.</v>

4752
02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4753
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:24.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean they are savages.</v>

4754
02:00:24.730 --> 02:00:25.161
<v Speaker 4>I was ring,</v>

4755
02:00:25.161 --> 02:00:26.980
<v Speaker 4>so it was before ever even worked for the UFC.</v>

4756
02:00:26.981 --> 02:00:27.630
<v Speaker 4>I was uh,</v>

4757
02:00:27.630 --> 02:00:31.810
<v Speaker 4>I was cage side when Matt Hughes fought them in the UFC and that was when it was</v>

4758
02:00:31.811 --> 02:00:32.230
<v Speaker 4>evident.</v>

4759
02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:33.800
<v Speaker 4>The difference between a guy who cuts weight,</v>

4760
02:00:34.040 --> 02:00:36.400
<v Speaker 4>he's a big strong wrestler and the guy who doesn't soccer,</v>

4761
02:00:36.401 --> 02:00:38.320
<v Speaker 4>I just did not belong in there with bad news.</v>

4762
02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:39.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4763
02:00:39.050 --> 02:00:39.310
<v Speaker 4>Mad.</v>

4764
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:40.300
<v Speaker 4>He was just mauled him.</v>

4765
02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:44.040
<v Speaker 4>It was just too big and too good at the time that's hanging on.</v>

4766
02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

4767
02:00:47.970 --> 02:00:48.731
<v Speaker 2>my goodness.</v>

4768
02:00:48.731 --> 02:00:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Head kicked him.</v>

4769
02:00:51.650 --> 02:00:52.140
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

4770
02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:54.000
<v Speaker 2>This would be Khloe.</v>

4771
02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:55.213
<v Speaker 2>Jesus,</v>

4772
02:00:55.320 --> 02:00:56.310
<v Speaker 2>he's fucked up.</v>

4773
02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:57.330
<v Speaker 2>He's fucked.</v>

4774
02:00:58.410 --> 02:00:59.071
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Craig,</v>

4775
02:00:59.071 --> 02:01:01.360
<v Speaker 2>his game as fuck and</v>

4776
02:01:03.180 --> 02:01:04.740
<v Speaker 2>he cannot see the punches coming.</v>

4777
02:01:05.010 --> 02:01:06.300
<v Speaker 2>He can't see the right hand.</v>

4778
02:01:06.510 --> 02:01:07.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

4779
02:01:08.760 --> 02:01:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

4780
02:01:09.691 --> 02:01:11.340
<v Speaker 2>Can't let off the gas now,</v>

4781
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:12.070
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have it.</v>

4782
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:13.110
<v Speaker 2>He will lose the fight.</v>

4783
02:01:13.140 --> 02:01:13.531
<v Speaker 2>He's a lot.</v>

4784
02:01:13.531 --> 02:01:15.180
<v Speaker 2>He's a gave a pint of blood back there.</v>

4785
02:01:15.181 --> 02:01:16.050
<v Speaker 2>When you're sitting down.</v>

4786
02:01:16.290 --> 02:01:16.481
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4787
02:01:16.481 --> 02:01:17.610
<v Speaker 2>we tagged them again.</v>

4788
02:01:17.730 --> 02:01:18.630
<v Speaker 2>It's got to finish him.</v>

4789
02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:19.590
<v Speaker 2>You gotta finish him.</v>

4790
02:01:19.591 --> 02:01:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Jump on him.</v>

4791
02:01:20.220 --> 02:01:20.620
<v Speaker 2>There we go.</v>

4792
02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Keep landing that and fucking right hand</v>

4793
02:01:24.380 --> 02:01:24.831
<v Speaker 2>for our can.</v>

4794
02:01:24.831 --> 02:01:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Just jump guard right now.</v>

4795
02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.430
<v Speaker 2>You might just flop and jump guard.</v>

4796
02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:30.470
<v Speaker 2>He'll make it ready to wing that.</v>

4797
02:01:30.480 --> 02:01:32.020
<v Speaker 2>Ross didn't do it.</v>

4798
02:01:32.021 --> 02:01:32.781
<v Speaker 2>It's like here comes,</v>

4799
02:01:32.781 --> 02:01:33.371
<v Speaker 2>here comes the bed,</v>

4800
02:01:33.371 --> 02:01:34.240
<v Speaker 2>pull the trigger and time.</v>

4801
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:35.083
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4802
02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:37.311
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

4803
02:01:37.311 --> 02:01:37.701
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4804
02:01:37.701 --> 02:01:38.450
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

4805
02:01:38.450 --> 02:01:39.170
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

4806
02:01:39.170 --> 02:01:40.730
<v Speaker 4>You know the cut is one thing,</v>

4807
02:01:40.820 --> 02:01:42.230
<v Speaker 4>but you get past the cut.</v>

4808
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:43.460
<v Speaker 4>Who did more damage.</v>

4809
02:01:43.490 --> 02:01:44.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4810
02:01:44.090 --> 02:01:44.511
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4811
02:01:44.511 --> 02:01:45.344
<v Speaker 4>I mean</v>

4812
02:01:46.610 --> 02:01:47.810
<v Speaker 4>it is a nasty cut,</v>

4813
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 4>but he also threatened with rear naked.</v>

4814
02:01:49.900 --> 02:01:51.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean not really.</v>

4815
02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:53.430
<v Speaker 4>It never looked like it was closed.</v>

4816
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:56.450
<v Speaker 4>That was the closest that head kick and those combinations.</v>

4817
02:01:56.570 --> 02:01:57.830
<v Speaker 4>That's an interesting case.</v>

4818
02:01:57.890 --> 02:02:00.370
<v Speaker 4>As far as like judging around,</v>

4819
02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.940
<v Speaker 4>if I was going to judge that round,</v>

4820
02:02:01.941 --> 02:02:05.390
<v Speaker 4>I think I would be inclined to give it to him because he had kicked him,</v>

4821
02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 4>had him rocked chasing him.</v>

4822
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:09.590
<v Speaker 4>He was way closer to being ended.</v>

4823
02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Then a guy defending the back.</v>

4824
02:02:11.450 --> 02:02:12.283
<v Speaker 4>You know what guys?</v>

4825
02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:15.470
<v Speaker 4>Guys defend the back for a whole round and they're fine the next round,</v>

4826
02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:16.580
<v Speaker 4>he's not fine.</v>

4827
02:02:16.610 --> 02:02:17.570
<v Speaker 4>He got fucked up.</v>

4828
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:18.051
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

4829
02:02:18.051 --> 02:02:18.950
<v Speaker 4>he got head kicked,</v>

4830
02:02:18.951 --> 02:02:19.790
<v Speaker 4>he got cracked.</v>

4831
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:21.020
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

4832
02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:25.010
<v Speaker 4>that highlights the real problem with a 10 point must boxing system being used</v>

4833
02:02:25.011 --> 02:02:28.580
<v Speaker 4>in MMA and not being even used correctly or the problem is,</v>

4834
02:02:28.581 --> 02:02:29.530
<v Speaker 4>is that the equal</v>

4835
02:02:29.570 --> 02:02:31.180
<v Speaker 2>criteria according to Muslim is,</v>

4836
02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:33.020
<v Speaker 2>is effective striking in a fit of grappling.</v>

4837
02:02:33.410 --> 02:02:37.640
<v Speaker 2>Well affective grappling doesn't cut a guy up,</v>

4838
02:02:37.641 --> 02:02:38.870
<v Speaker 2>doesn't leave a lot of marks.</v>

4839
02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Affective striking guys on roller skates.</v>

4840
02:02:40.791 --> 02:02:41.990
<v Speaker 2>It's ways you to see.</v>

4841
02:02:42.260 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

4842
02:02:42.650 --> 02:02:43.431
<v Speaker 2>so judging wise,</v>

4843
02:02:43.431 --> 02:02:44.540
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to deal with.</v>

4844
02:02:44.710 --> 02:02:45.543
<v Speaker 2>Really difficult.</v>

4845
02:02:45.560 --> 02:02:46.100
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

4846
02:02:46.100 --> 02:02:46.933
<v Speaker 2>Very true.</v>

4847
02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Very true.</v>

4848
02:02:47.780 --> 02:02:48.800
<v Speaker 2>I've seen guys get school.</v>

4849
02:02:48.801 --> 02:02:49.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>

4850
02:02:49.520 --> 02:02:49.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4851
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:51.620
<v Speaker 2>the great thing about Jujitsu when we train it,</v>

4852
02:02:51.621 --> 02:02:53.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can go with a world champion.</v>

4853
02:02:53.301 --> 02:02:54.290
<v Speaker 2>All you do is tap a lot.</v>

4854
02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4855
02:02:54.970 --> 02:02:55.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4856
02:02:55.290 --> 02:02:56.123
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

4857
02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:58.100
<v Speaker 2>if you go 10 rounds of mallet pet,</v>

4858
02:02:58.101 --> 02:02:58.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4859
02:02:58.311 --> 02:02:59.960
<v Speaker 2>you're like glue in your limbs back together.</v>

4860
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.441
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

4861
02:03:00.441 --> 02:03:01.950
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't even in sparring.</v>

4862
02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:04.260
<v Speaker 2>So you know with grapple,</v>

4863
02:03:04.261 --> 02:03:05.270
<v Speaker 2>that's a great part of it is,</v>

4864
02:03:05.360 --> 02:03:05.691
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

4865
02:03:05.691 --> 02:03:06.524
<v Speaker 2>I just got pinned a lot.</v>

4866
02:03:06.750 --> 02:03:07.910
<v Speaker 2>It was unfortunate.</v>

4867
02:03:07.911 --> 02:03:08.721
<v Speaker 2>But you're okay.</v>

4868
02:03:08.721 --> 02:03:11.060
<v Speaker 2>The next day I tell you a little bit because you have these two brothers from</v>

4869
02:03:11.061 --> 02:03:15.350
<v Speaker 2>the Arctic Jujitsu that train does strength conditioning with me and I'm like,</v>

4870
02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:16.730
<v Speaker 2>just stick with Jujitsu.</v>

4871
02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Don't we get beat up for a living,</v>

4872
02:03:18.570 --> 02:03:19.850
<v Speaker 2>don't have to worry about getting punched.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

4955
02:05:17.701 --> 02:05:20.850
<v Speaker 4>It's funny like Phil Baroni was talking about at once and he was like,</v>

4956
02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:23.400
<v Speaker 4>fucking let everybody do fucking steroids.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

4958
02:05:24.001 --> 02:05:26.910
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to see choose to Vandelay back when he was in pride,</v>

4959
02:05:26.911 --> 02:05:27.870
<v Speaker 4>when he was at his best.</v>

4960
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:29.130
<v Speaker 4>I was laughing,</v>

4961
02:05:29.131 --> 02:05:29.671
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>

4962
02:05:29.671 --> 02:05:32.190
<v Speaker 4>part of me agrees with that.</v>

4963
02:05:32.191 --> 02:05:33.750
<v Speaker 4>Like as a fan,</v>

4964
02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:38.220
<v Speaker 4>just a fan of the spectacle of Vandelay Silva of Cro,</v>

4965
02:05:38.221 --> 02:05:39.870
<v Speaker 4>cop of the guys when they were at their best.</v>

4966
02:05:40.290 --> 02:05:42.510
<v Speaker 4>I know that was fun to watch.</v>

4967
02:05:42.720 --> 02:05:44.310
<v Speaker 4>Vandelay in his prime was fun to watch.</v>

4968
02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:44.911
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

4969
02:05:44.911 --> 02:05:46.380
<v Speaker 4>Who knows what he was actually on.</v>

4970
02:05:46.410 --> 02:05:50.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm just assuming we're not medical professionals.</v>

4971
02:05:50.490 --> 02:05:52.830
<v Speaker 4>We all know that people take things.</v>

4972
02:05:52.831 --> 02:05:52.981
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4973
02:05:52.981 --> 02:05:55.440
<v Speaker 4>he's a reason why this chill son and news is out.</v>

4974
02:05:55.590 --> 02:05:57.570
<v Speaker 4>There's a reason why it's not that surprising.</v>

4975
02:05:57.600 --> 02:05:58.440
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>

4976
02:05:58.680 --> 02:05:59.513
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4977
02:05:59.850 --> 02:06:03.510
<v Speaker 4>it's not the first thing he's cheated when people take things they just do.</v>

4978
02:06:03.690 --> 02:06:06.660
<v Speaker 4>And especially when you talked to a guy like ensign who tells you that no one</v>

4979
02:06:06.661 --> 02:06:10.290
<v Speaker 4>got tested and that the fucking contract said we will not test you force bat</v>

4980
02:06:10.291 --> 02:06:13.590
<v Speaker 4>roids and then in Brazil you can get steroids the same place you get gum.</v>

4981
02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:14.370
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4982
02:06:14.370 --> 02:06:14.970
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4983
02:06:14.970 --> 02:06:18.000
<v Speaker 4>oh I'll take a pack of gum and fucking nozzle all.</v>

4984
02:06:18.001 --> 02:06:19.170
<v Speaker 4>Go ahead and throw that in there too.</v>

4985
02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:20.970
<v Speaker 4>Something with a horse on the label.</v>

4986
02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:21.770
<v Speaker 4>You mean that Oh,</v>

4987
02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:25.050
<v Speaker 4>Calvin gasoline and Nico Moose Soki he's gotten so good.</v>

4988
02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:25.973
<v Speaker 4>Fuck cashless.</v>

4989
02:06:26.710 --> 02:06:27.280
<v Speaker 4>Striking.</v>

4990
02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:28.830
<v Speaker 4>Fucking ridiculous.</v>

4991
02:06:29.070 --> 02:06:33.570
<v Speaker 4>The looseness of his striking his boxing against Rick story was really,</v>

4992
02:06:33.600 --> 02:06:34.620
<v Speaker 4>really impressive.</v>

4993
02:06:35.130 --> 02:06:37.770
<v Speaker 4>But fucking kids struggling to make weight.</v>

4994
02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:39.750
<v Speaker 4>And Mike Dolce is a motherfucker dude.</v>

4995
02:06:39.960 --> 02:06:43.200
<v Speaker 4>Like Joe Dolce took a picture cause after he lost,</v>

4996
02:06:43.201 --> 02:06:46.620
<v Speaker 4>he didn't make weight again and they asked him why stopped using dolce said</v>

4997
02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:48.300
<v Speaker 4>cause dolce was too expensive.</v>

4998
02:06:48.480 --> 02:06:52.920
<v Speaker 4>So dolce took a picture of him making weight easy at one 70 and then he wrote</v>

4999
02:06:52.921 --> 02:06:54.930
<v Speaker 4>Hashtag worth every penny,</v>

5000
02:06:57.030 --> 02:06:58.620
<v Speaker 4>which is a fucked up.</v>

5001
02:06:59.010 --> 02:06:59.843
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

5002
02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:01.690
<v Speaker 4>But there's a moose.</v>

5003
02:07:01.710 --> 02:07:02.543
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

5004
02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:04.470

<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5007
02:07:05.971 --> 02:07:07.410
<v Speaker 4>I saw him for the first time.</v>

5008
02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:08.293

5011
02:07:13.150 --> 02:07:17.110

5012
02:07:17.170 --> 02:07:17.500

02:07:19.570 --> 02:07:20.403
<v Speaker 4>that weight cut.</v>

5016
02:07:20.670 --> 02:07:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Cause that's a hard wait.</v>

5017
02:07:21.851 --> 02:07:22.340
<v Speaker 4>Cut.</v>

5018
02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:23.500
<v Speaker 4>If that he didn't make,</v>

5019
02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:25.560
<v Speaker 4>he didn't make it promotionally.</v>

5020
02:07:25.570 --> 02:07:26.800
<v Speaker 4>And once again,</v>

5021
02:07:26.801 --> 02:07:27.071
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

5022
02:07:27.071 --> 02:07:29.890
<v Speaker 4>if you're getting into this game promotionally it,</v>

5023
02:07:29.891 --> 02:07:31.930
<v Speaker 4>it makes you so hard to deal with it.</v>

5024
02:07:31.950 --> 02:07:32.711
<v Speaker 4>It makes you very,</v>

5025
02:07:32.711 --> 02:07:33.570
<v Speaker 4>they hate that.</v>

5026
02:07:33.571 --> 02:07:33.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5027
02:07:33.750 --> 02:07:35.170
<v Speaker 4>I mean they hate that with a passion.</v>

5028
02:07:35.290 --> 02:07:37.900
<v Speaker 4>Very hard to promote a guy who does it make weight.</v>

5029
02:07:37.930 --> 02:07:39.160
<v Speaker 4>It's how much should we put behind this guy?</v>

5030
02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:40.540
<v Speaker 4>Don't know if it's getting on the scale and make it,</v>

5031
02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:40.780
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5032
02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:41.561
<v Speaker 4>it can really,</v>

5033
02:07:41.561 --> 02:07:42.460
<v Speaker 4>really kill your career.</v>

5034
02:07:42.461 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 4>It ruins irrelevance if a fight ruins it completely.</v>

5035
02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:46.113
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5036
02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:46.841
<v Speaker 4>Well we,</v>

5037
02:07:46.841 --> 02:07:47.410
<v Speaker 4>we do,</v>

5038
02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:48.850
<v Speaker 4>we talked about it a little bit before,</v>

5039
02:07:48.851 --> 02:07:53.851
<v Speaker 4>but is there a way that you can have guys weigh in the day of the fight?</v>

5040
02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:54.910
<v Speaker 4>Is there,</v>

5041
02:07:54.910 --> 02:07:57.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean my thought I had a crazy idea.</v>

5042
02:07:57.341 --> 02:07:58.210
<v Speaker 4>It's not a good idea,</v>

5043
02:07:58.240 --> 02:07:59.040
<v Speaker 4>but look,</v>

5044
02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:01.240
<v Speaker 4>you could have an understudy like you,</v>

5045
02:08:01.241 --> 02:08:02.680
<v Speaker 4>like you know how they do at Broadway.</v>

5046
02:08:02.770 --> 02:08:03.820
<v Speaker 4>Like if a guy gets hurt,</v>

5047
02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:04.930
<v Speaker 4>the show must go on.</v>

5048
02:08:04.931 --> 02:08:07.900
<v Speaker 4>They have a guy who actually knows the role and he'll take the place if a guy</v>

5049
02:08:08.260 --> 02:08:09.610
<v Speaker 4>gets sick or something like that.</v>

5050
02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:14.590
<v Speaker 4>Like if a guy does not weigh in at a specific amount the day of the fight,</v>

5051
02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:16.060
<v Speaker 4>commentators don't have those by the way.</v>

5052
02:08:16.740 --> 02:08:18.460
<v Speaker 4>We've got to get on there whether we have a voice or not.</v>

5053
02:08:18.461 --> 02:08:18.571
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5054
02:08:18.571 --> 02:08:19.404
<v Speaker 4>we don't get drunk.</v>

5055
02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:24.550
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't do so good math with that.</v>

5056
02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:29.340
<v Speaker 4>You want to get old tire implement drug testing for MMA.</v>

5057
02:08:30.550 --> 02:08:31.810
<v Speaker 4>That's a wrap son.</v>

5058
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:32.673
<v Speaker 4>It's been,</v>

5059
02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:34.480
<v Speaker 4>it's been great,</v>

5060
02:08:34.750 --> 02:08:35.583
<v Speaker 4>but it's over.</v>

5061
02:08:35.950 --> 02:08:36.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5062
02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:37.720
<v Speaker 4>he fought a car.</v>

5063
02:08:37.721 --> 02:08:38.140
<v Speaker 4>That's who most,</v>

5064
02:08:38.140 --> 02:08:38.810
<v Speaker 4>okay fought.</v>

5065
02:08:38.810 --> 02:08:39.820
<v Speaker 4>And I saw him in,</v>

5066
02:08:39.821 --> 02:08:43.810
<v Speaker 4>in Manchester and Carmen and armbar actually it was a great fight up until that</v>

5067
02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:44.430
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

5068
02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:45.550
<v Speaker 4>A ridiculous fight.</v>

5069
02:08:45.700 --> 02:08:46.870
<v Speaker 4>So understudies,</v>

5070
02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:47.920
<v Speaker 4>so if the guy doesn't make weight,</v>

5071
02:08:47.921 --> 02:08:48.670
<v Speaker 4>the other guy steps in.</v>

5072
02:08:48.670 --> 02:08:49.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5073
02:08:49.150 --> 02:08:51.100
<v Speaker 4>So like the guy doesn't get any of his purse.</v>

5074
02:08:51.130 --> 02:08:52.570
<v Speaker 4>He gets no money if he doesn't make the weight.</v>

5075
02:08:53.590 --> 02:08:58.090
<v Speaker 4>So it seemed that he'd keep guys from doing stupid shit like trying to lose 30</v>

5076
02:08:58.091 --> 02:08:59.020
<v Speaker 4>pounds in a day,</v>

5077
02:08:59.320 --> 02:08:59.680
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5078
02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.760
<v Speaker 4>which we've all seen,</v>

5079
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:01.623
<v Speaker 4>we've all seen,</v>

5080
02:09:01.630 --> 02:09:02.740
<v Speaker 4>I saw Travis Luder,</v>

5081
02:09:02.741 --> 02:09:05.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm never seen a guy closer to death that went on to fight.</v>

5082
02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:07.150
<v Speaker 4>Never saw a guy looks so bad.</v>

5083
02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:11.260
<v Speaker 4>Travis Luder came in way overweight and tried real hard to make it.</v>

5084
02:09:11.290 --> 02:09:12.550
<v Speaker 4>But the first,</v>

5085
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:16.030
<v Speaker 4>the first time he was like two and a half over and then he just,</v>

5086
02:09:16.031 --> 02:09:17.060
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't lose any more.</v>

5087
02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:18.160
<v Speaker 4>He tried really hard,</v>

5088
02:09:18.161 --> 02:09:19.300
<v Speaker 4>but he was so drunk.</v>

5089
02:09:19.301 --> 02:09:19.841
<v Speaker 4>Silva fight,</v>

5090
02:09:19.841 --> 02:09:20.490
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

5091
02:09:20.490 --> 02:09:20.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5092
02:09:20.830 --> 02:09:21.070
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>

5093
02:09:21.070 --> 02:09:23.230
<v Speaker 4>So it was a non title fight and then he got stopped.</v>

5094
02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.630
<v Speaker 4>He got caught in a triangle and got elbowed.</v>

5095
02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:27.440
<v Speaker 4>He came close to winning that got full mountain,</v>

5096
02:09:27.441 --> 02:09:32.350
<v Speaker 4>the first round tremor that going God damn as Luther was a mother fucker,</v>

5097
02:09:32.740 --> 02:09:34.000

02:09:36.071 --> 02:09:40.960
<v Speaker 4>tough guy do to learn Jujitsu and got really fucking good taking tournaments out</v>

5101
02:09:40.961 --> 02:09:41.794
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

5102
02:09:41.830 --> 02:09:43.510
<v Speaker 4>Charles McCarthy here on Gracie,</v>

5103
02:09:43.570 --> 02:09:44.321
<v Speaker 4>Charles McCarthy,</v>

5104
02:09:44.321 --> 02:09:45.430
<v Speaker 4>who I really respected,</v>

5105
02:09:45.431 --> 02:09:49.700
<v Speaker 4>he beat here on Gracie really here on or hinder cause a big term out here and,</v>

5106
02:09:49.701 --> 02:09:50.680
<v Speaker 4>and he ended up winning it.</v>

5107
02:09:50.710 --> 02:09:51.511

5110
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:57.010
<v Speaker 4>Charles McCarthy was on the ultimate fighter.</v>

5111
02:09:57.011 --> 02:10:00.700
<v Speaker 4>When you look that up and confirm whether or not McCarthy said it was like</v>

5112
02:10:00.701 --> 02:10:02.050
<v Speaker 4>rolling with Laborio,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just had no gas at all.</v>

5142
02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:51.230
<v Speaker 4>But he had rich Franklin down and had them almost in an arm bar.</v>

5143

5157

<v Speaker 4>But he got guillotine by Matt Lindland.</v>

5158
02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:20.600
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] was a motherfucker.</v>

5159
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:21.703
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

5160
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:23.840
<v Speaker 4>people forget how God Damn Good Matt,</v>

5161
02:11:23.841 --> 02:11:24.674
<v Speaker 4>when Lynn was,</v>

5162
02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:26.780
<v Speaker 4>he was those guys who was,</v>

5163
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:27.643
<v Speaker 4>who was,</v>

5164
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:29.210
<v Speaker 4>could beat anybody.</v>

5165
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:31.700
<v Speaker 4>But man,</v>

5166
02:11:31.701 --> 02:11:33.950
<v Speaker 4>his style was just never fan friendly.</v>

5167
02:11:34.240 --> 02:11:34.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5168
02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:35.750
<v Speaker 4>Madelyn's never,</v>

5169
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.240
<v Speaker 4>well I don't know.</v>

5170
02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:39.620
<v Speaker 4>You know that fan friendly thing,</v>

5171
02:11:39.621 --> 02:11:41.060
<v Speaker 4>they say that about aspirin to,</v>

5172
02:11:41.390 --> 02:11:42.170
<v Speaker 4>to me,</v>

5173
02:11:42.170 --> 02:11:43.010
<v Speaker 4>if you're a fan,</v>

5174
02:11:43.011 --> 02:11:44.780
<v Speaker 4>you gotta be fascinated by everything.</v>

5175
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:46.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm fascinated that I appreciate him.</v>

5176
02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:48.650
<v Speaker 4>He could take Douglas Lema down a rag doll.</v>

5177
02:11:48.651 --> 02:11:49.610
<v Speaker 4>I'm like that's all it is.</v>

5178
02:11:49.690 --> 02:11:50.523
<v Speaker 2>I might cut the leave.</v>

5179
02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Fuck what am I looking?</v>

5180
02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:53.750
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe it.</v>

5181
02:11:53.870 --> 02:11:55.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of that man.</v>

5182
02:11:55.521 --> 02:11:56.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fan of that.</v>

5183
02:11:56.391 --> 02:11:58.750
<v Speaker 4>You can't say that's not fan friendly cause I,</v>

5184
02:11:59.060 --> 02:12:03.440
<v Speaker 4>I was really bummed out when the asker in UFC thing didn't work out.</v>

5185
02:12:03.650 --> 02:12:06.440
<v Speaker 4>And when take Dana White said that ambient takes,</v>

5186
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:12.310
<v Speaker 2>oh I disagree.</v>

5187
02:12:12.311 --> 02:12:13.660
<v Speaker 2>I think we have,</v>

5188
02:12:13.970 --> 02:12:16.340
<v Speaker 4>in order for a title to be legitimate,</v>

5189
02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:21.620
<v Speaker 4>you have to see how a champion stands up to any and all challenges that are</v>

5190
02:12:21.621 --> 02:12:22.454
<v Speaker 4>effective.</v>

5191
02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:26.240
<v Speaker 4>And just because it's not fan friendly doesn't mean it's not effective.</v>

5192
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:27.350
<v Speaker 4>If it's effective,</v>

5193
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:27.901
<v Speaker 4>if the,</v>

5194
02:12:27.901 --> 02:12:29.960
<v Speaker 4>the better guys going to fucking win,</v>

5195
02:12:30.110 --> 02:12:31.910
<v Speaker 4>you got to let him fight any way they want.</v>

5196
02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:33.350
<v Speaker 4>The problem is,</v>

5197
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.641
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

5198
02:12:33.641 --> 02:12:36.860
<v Speaker 4>and guys like us are the hardcore fans of sport.</v>

5199
02:12:37.290 --> 02:12:38.123
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5200
02:12:38.580 --> 02:12:38.661
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

5201
02:12:38.661 --> 02:12:42.120
<v Speaker 2>it's hard for hardcore fans to understand is we aren't the target market.</v>

5202
02:12:42.630 --> 02:12:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants it on the mom and pop's of the world watching MMA and we aren't,</v>

5203

5204
02:12:48.481 --> 02:12:48.661
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5205
02:12:48.661 --> 02:12:48.891
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

5206
02:12:48.891 --> 02:12:50.370
<v Speaker 2>the hawkers and I said to me all the time,</v>

5207
02:12:50.371 --> 02:12:50.730
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

5208
02:12:50.730 --> 02:12:51.630
<v Speaker 2>you don't appreciate this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Doing this for 40.</v>

5218

5223
02:13:15.211 --> 02:13:16.044
<v Speaker 2>forearms.</v>

5224
02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:17.970
<v Speaker 2>But you both know,</v>

5225
02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:18.540
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

5226
02:13:18.540 --> 02:13:22.570
<v Speaker 2>forearms are not designed to take fucking hard Molokai knots.</v>

5227
02:13:23.180 --> 02:13:24.120
<v Speaker 2>Take a bat and swing that.</v>

5236
02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 2>I think I kicked so</v>

5237
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:33.870
<v Speaker 1>much and it keeps you from punching.</v>

5238
02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Your arms are fucked up for a while.</v>

5239
02:13:36.060 --> 02:13:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Like for a few seconds.</v>

5240
02:13:37.231 --> 02:13:39.870
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to throw a punch with that arm cause he's not feeling so good.</v>

5241
02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:40.071
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

02:13:40.671 --> 02:13:41.451
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to move.</v>

5244
02:13:41.451 --> 02:13:42.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to move your leg.</v>

5245
02:13:42.350 --> 02:13:44.720
<v Speaker 2>Robbie Lawler and Ellenberger right off the bat</v>

5246
02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.950

5247
02:13:46.980 --> 02:13:47.970
<v Speaker 1>with the forearms,</v>

5248
02:13:48.150 --> 02:13:49.020
<v Speaker 1>he blocks him.</v>

5249

02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Late Calvin.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He's got his back.</v>

5285
02:14:58.780 --> 02:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>So he's gotta be thinking the Kelvins fucking worn out from that weight cut.</v>

5286
02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:03.010
<v Speaker 1>That might be one.</v>

5287
02:15:03.010 --> 02:15:03.711
<v Speaker 1>The monomer lie.</v>

02:15:04.041 --> 02:15:05.570
<v Speaker 1>he's pushing such a hard pace.</v>

5290
02:15:06.020 --> 02:15:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Cause Calvin barely made weight on the undercard of the Johnny Sanchez or Johnny</v>

02:15:14.330 --> 02:15:16.760
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the ones that also struggled to make weight.</v>

5294
02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Barely made it.</v>

5295
02:15:17.811 --> 02:15:18.620
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

5296
02:15:18.620 --> 02:15:20.660
<v Speaker 1>looked like he was on fucking death's door.</v>

5297
02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:22.250
<v Speaker 1>And that was back in Dallas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So light on his feet.</v>

5444
02:18:57.090 --> 02:18:57.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>

5445
02:18:57.690 --> 02:19:00.720
<v Speaker 1>that's something that he started getting after the ultimate fighter.</v>

5446
02:19:00.930 --> 02:19:01.231
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

5447
02:19:01.231 --> 02:19:06.231
<v Speaker 1>we Soki keeps landing that right kick over and over and over again into the sun.</v>

5448
02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:07.441
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5449
02:19:07.441 --> 02:19:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Calvin with a good straight laughed.</v>

5450
02:19:09.930 --> 02:19:10.411
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5451
02:19:10.411 --> 02:19:11.280
<v Speaker 1>good combination.</v>

5452
02:19:11.281 --> 02:19:11.491
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

5453
02:19:11.491 --> 02:19:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Hook in a straight where number cut.</v>

5454
02:19:13.740 --> 02:19:14.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5455
02:19:14.011 --> 02:19:17.310
<v Speaker 1>I think Calvin thinks he hurt Nico at the end of that round.</v>

5456
02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Those couple of shots jumping on and landed.</v>

5457
02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5458
02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Good kick to the body.</v>

5459
02:19:21.210 --> 02:19:21.871
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>

5460
02:19:21.871 --> 02:19:22.770
<v Speaker 1>He's all over him.</v>

5461
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:23.790
<v Speaker 1>Got to get off the fence.</v>

5462
02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:26.070
<v Speaker 1>Promise he's going against the fences feeder squaring up.</v>

5463
02:19:26.250 --> 02:19:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Calvin is a fucking man.</v>

5464
02:19:28.160 --> 02:19:29.180
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough kid.</v>

5465
02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:31.580
<v Speaker 4>It's just for me,</v>

5466
02:19:31.581 --> 02:19:34.220
<v Speaker 4>it's a matter of him being healthy at this weight.</v>

5467
02:19:34.700 --> 02:19:35.720
<v Speaker 4>I think he can't do it.</v>

5468
02:19:35.721 --> 02:19:37.190
<v Speaker 4>If he uses a guy like dolce,</v>

5469
02:19:37.310 --> 02:19:39.170
<v Speaker 4>he's got a diabetic because you can just look at it and be like,</v>

5470
02:19:39.171 --> 02:19:39.501
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5471
02:19:39.501 --> 02:19:39.920
<v Speaker 4>he could.</v>

5472
02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:40.830
<v Speaker 4>He could lose some pounds.</v>

5473
02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:42.770
<v Speaker 4>I see a good five,</v>

5474
02:19:42.771 --> 02:19:43.604
<v Speaker 4>six pounds.</v>

5475
02:19:43.770 --> 02:19:44.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5476
02:19:44.300 --> 02:19:45.920
<v Speaker 4>He just get with dolce bro.</v>

5477
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:46.783
<v Speaker 4>Pay Him the money.</v>

5478
02:19:46.850 --> 02:19:47.450
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

5479
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:49.280
<v Speaker 4>it ain't 20% okay.</v>

5480
02:19:49.990 --> 02:19:52.340
<v Speaker 4>We lost 20% of your purse pay.</v>

5481
02:19:52.341 --> 02:19:54.530
<v Speaker 4>Daltry he knows his shit.</v>

5482
02:19:54.770 --> 02:19:55.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5483
02:19:55.460 --> 02:19:56.450
<v Speaker 4>He gets everybody on weight,</v>

5484
02:19:56.540 --> 02:19:58.040
<v Speaker 4>everybody and they look great.</v>

5485
02:19:58.100 --> 02:19:59.210
<v Speaker 4>How about Tiago Elvis?</v>

5486
02:19:59.211 --> 02:20:04.211
<v Speaker 4>He had Tiago Alva as 170 pounds a day before the weigh in and looked at smaller</v>

5487
02:20:04.521 --> 02:20:06.080
<v Speaker 4>like look like you lost a little bit of muscle,</v>

5488
02:20:06.081 --> 02:20:06.570
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>

5489
02:20:06.570 --> 02:20:08.210
<v Speaker 4>well rate gas tank moved.</v>

5490
02:20:08.211 --> 02:20:10.010
<v Speaker 4>Well and that's the difference.</v>

5491
02:20:10.011 --> 02:20:10.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

5492
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:14.300
<v Speaker 4>do you want to go Tyron Woodley where you're so big that you know you're super</v>

5493
02:20:14.301 --> 02:20:16.130
<v Speaker 4>explosive for like a minute and a half,</v>

5494
02:20:16.190 --> 02:20:16.731
<v Speaker 4>two minutes,</v>

5495
02:20:16.731 --> 02:20:17.564
<v Speaker 4>three minutes?</v>

5496
02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:19.130
<v Speaker 4>I think psychologically,</v>

5497
02:20:19.131 --> 02:20:20.090
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times for fighters,</v>

5498
02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:23.810
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a security blanket to be big and swole and they don't feel that</v>

5499
02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:25.070
<v Speaker 4>there'll be able to win without it.</v>

5500
02:20:25.071 --> 02:20:26.120
<v Speaker 4>It's more like I,</v>

5501
02:20:26.121 --> 02:20:27.470
<v Speaker 4>the confidence of being the bigger,</v>

5502
02:20:27.471 --> 02:20:28.101
<v Speaker 4>stronger guy,</v>

5503
02:20:28.101 --> 02:20:30.140
<v Speaker 4>but it's not worth the trade off a lot of times.</v>

5504
02:20:30.470 --> 02:20:31.310
<v Speaker 4>It's not where it really is.</v>

5505
02:20:31.311 --> 02:20:33.770
<v Speaker 4>Losing your gas is the scariest thing ever.</v>

5506
02:20:33.800 --> 02:20:33.981
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5507
02:20:33.981 --> 02:20:34.641
<v Speaker 4>that's the worst.</v>

5508
02:20:34.641 --> 02:20:36.170
<v Speaker 4>Another person trying to beat you to death,</v>

5509
02:20:36.370 --> 02:20:37.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired.</v>

5510
02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:38.090
<v Speaker 4>Beat you to death.</v>

5511
02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:40.070
<v Speaker 4>Like there wasn't a reference there.</v>

5512
02:20:40.071 --> 02:20:41.210
<v Speaker 4>That person could kill you.</v>

5513
02:20:41.240 --> 02:20:41.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

5514
02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:42.241
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

5515
02:20:42.241 --> 02:20:43.280
<v Speaker 4>Dolan was save him.</v>

5516
02:20:43.430 --> 02:20:43.851
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>

5517
02:20:43.851 --> 02:20:46.670
<v Speaker 4>there's a great story of George Foreman,</v>

5518
02:20:46.850 --> 02:20:49.970
<v Speaker 4>Muhammad Ali when they were fighting and Zaire and it's like,</v>

5519
02:20:49.971 --> 02:20:50.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5520
02:20:50.181 --> 02:20:51.140
<v Speaker 4>the seventh or eighth round,</v>

5521
02:20:51.141 --> 02:20:51.980
<v Speaker 4>it's almost over,</v>

5522
02:20:52.160 --> 02:20:52.461
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>

5523
02:20:52.461 --> 02:20:53.181
<v Speaker 4>I had nothing left,</v>

5524
02:20:53.181 --> 02:20:53.481
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>

5525
02:20:53.481 --> 02:20:55.490
<v Speaker 4>I hit Ali with a good one,</v>

5526
02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:56.630
<v Speaker 4>a good body shot,</v>

5527
02:20:56.780 --> 02:20:57.560
<v Speaker 4>and I heard them go,</v>

5528
02:20:57.560 --> 02:20:58.400
<v Speaker 4>is that all you got?</v>

5529
02:20:58.970 --> 02:21:00.110
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking,</v>

5530
02:21:00.470 --> 02:21:00.801
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

5531
02:21:00.801 --> 02:21:01.634
<v Speaker 4>that's about it.</v>

5532
02:21:02.930 --> 02:21:05.360
<v Speaker 4>That moment of going all right as,</v>

5533
02:21:05.740 --> 02:21:06.050
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

5534
02:21:06.050 --> 02:21:06.530
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

5535
02:21:06.530 --> 02:21:07.341
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of gas.</v>

5536
02:21:07.341 --> 02:21:09.620
<v Speaker 4>That's the worst fuel Kelvin's all over him again.</v>

5537
02:21:09.650 --> 02:21:12.050
<v Speaker 4>Beautiful combination knee.</v>

5538
02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:13.190
<v Speaker 4>He hit him with an elbow,</v>

5539
02:21:13.310 --> 02:21:15.020
<v Speaker 4>caught him on the elbow with that foot though.</v>

5540
02:21:15.021 --> 02:21:15.854
<v Speaker 4>They'll have a hurt.</v>

5541
02:21:17.090 --> 02:21:17.301
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5542
02:21:17.301 --> 02:21:18.740
<v Speaker 4>another one took a body kick.</v>

5543
02:21:20.750 --> 02:21:25.370
<v Speaker 4>Good blocking to Kelvin has improved so much and change so much in the way he</v>

5544
02:21:25.371 --> 02:21:26.204
<v Speaker 4>moves.</v>

5545
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:26.811
<v Speaker 4>That's Oh,</v>

5546
02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:27.291
<v Speaker 4>nice.</v>

5547
02:21:27.291 --> 02:21:29.540
<v Speaker 4>Step off to the side and throw that left kick to the body.</v>

5548
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:30.261
<v Speaker 4>Foot works good.</v>

5549
02:21:30.261 --> 02:21:31.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what's setting everything up is he?</v>

5550
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.310
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

5551
02:21:32.310 --> 02:21:34.250
<v Speaker 4>he's cutting enough angles that he can't see it coming.</v>

5552
02:21:34.370 --> 02:21:36.020
<v Speaker 4>He's also light on his feet,</v>

5553
02:21:36.021 --> 02:21:37.760
<v Speaker 4>which is a rarity in MMA.</v>

5554
02:21:37.761 --> 02:21:41.780
<v Speaker 4>That's a really important thing to have that mobility that you see so often in</v>

5555
02:21:41.781 --> 02:21:44.450
<v Speaker 4>boxing and karate and a lot of other martial arts,</v>

5556
02:21:44.451 --> 02:21:45.470
<v Speaker 4>but in MMA,</v>

5557
02:21:45.471 --> 02:21:49.790
<v Speaker 4>so many guys are trying to like Moy Tai it stand flat foot or wrestling</v>

5558
02:21:49.791 --> 02:21:51.050
<v Speaker 4>wrestling's very flat footed.</v>

5559
02:21:51.080 --> 02:21:51.913
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

5560
02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:52.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5561
02:21:52.290 --> 02:21:52.440
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

5562
02:21:52.440 --> 02:21:55.040
<v Speaker 4>the accuracy rate on a 100% punches.</v>

5563
02:21:55.100 --> 02:21:56.820
<v Speaker 4>So slammed comparative.</v>

5564
02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.300
<v Speaker 4>You land for 50% chance.</v>

5565
02:21:58.301 --> 02:21:58.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5566
02:21:58.600 --> 02:21:59.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5567
02:21:59.240 --> 02:22:00.530
<v Speaker 4>He gets someone wobbled.</v>

5568
02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:01.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5569
02:22:01.431 --> 02:22:04.820
<v Speaker 4>And the foot work that you're able to achieve by being light on your feet.</v>

5570
02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:09.820
<v Speaker 4>Like the Tj Dillashaw Hanan Barao fight were so light on his feet that Hennen</v>

5571
02:22:09.860 --> 02:22:13.490
<v Speaker 4>Browne never had a stationary target to load up on all this.</v>

5572
02:22:13.550 --> 02:22:14.780
<v Speaker 4>This spinning kicks.</v>

5573
02:22:14.781 --> 02:22:17.000
<v Speaker 4>He was always the same side.</v>

5574
02:22:17.001 --> 02:22:17.300
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

5575
02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:19.290
<v Speaker 4>He was always pivot on the same side and he was falling.</v>

5576
02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:21.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm like an elevator door or like a,</v>

5577
02:22:21.051 --> 02:22:23.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm one of those revolving doors.</v>

5578
02:22:23.181 --> 02:22:23.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5579
02:22:23.390 --> 02:22:24.223
<v Speaker 4>Just get in it.</v>

5580
02:22:24.600 --> 02:22:25.433
<v Speaker 4>Follow the door.</v>

5581
02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:27.870
<v Speaker 4>Calvin's all over him.</v>

5582
02:22:27.871 --> 02:22:28.140
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

5583
02:22:28.140 --> 02:22:29.820
<v Speaker 4>This is all about him off the fence either.</v>

5584
02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:32.820
<v Speaker 4>This is the Kelvin Gasol him round man.</v>

5585
02:22:32.821 --> 02:22:34.290
<v Speaker 4>He's put a beating on Nico,</v>

5586
02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:35.700
<v Speaker 4>so put to rest.</v>

5587
02:22:35.701 --> 02:22:37.680
<v Speaker 4>Any thoughts about him being completely diminished?</v>

5588
02:22:37.681 --> 02:22:38.101
<v Speaker 4>By the way?</v>

5589
02:22:38.101 --> 02:22:38.934
<v Speaker 4>Cut.</v>

5590
02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:43.920
<v Speaker 4>He's obviously got a lot in his fucking tank man and Nico's exhausted.</v>

5591
02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:47.731
<v Speaker 4>It's getting broken into.</v>

5592
02:22:47.731 --> 02:22:48.980
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing that,</v>

5593
02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:49.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5594
02:22:49.640 --> 02:22:51.710
<v Speaker 4>they used to not test for EPO,</v>

5595
02:22:51.890 --> 02:22:54.380
<v Speaker 4>which is kind of hilarious because boxing,</v>

5596
02:22:54.440 --> 02:22:55.580
<v Speaker 4>the boxing commission,</v>

5597
02:22:55.610 --> 02:22:58.010
<v Speaker 4>they would say that boxing is not an endurance sport,</v>

5598
02:22:58.340 --> 02:22:59.740
<v Speaker 4>so you don't have to test for EPO.</v>

5599
02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:00.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5600
02:23:00.570 --> 02:23:04.250
<v Speaker 4>Having never imagined spoken like someone who's never done it before.</v>

5601
02:23:04.330 --> 02:23:08.680
<v Speaker 4>There's that dumb and they're a part of the commission that's judging.</v>

5602
02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:09.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5603
02:23:09.140 --> 02:23:11.360
<v Speaker 4>What gets passed and tested for,</v>

5604
02:23:11.361 --> 02:23:14.660
<v Speaker 4>and maybe it was like EPO is too expensive to test for EPO.</v>

5605
02:23:14.690 --> 02:23:19.010
<v Speaker 4>They developed a test and I want to say 2000 for Epo for the first time.</v>

5606
02:23:20.490 --> 02:23:21.323
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

5607
02:23:21.630 --> 02:23:23.900
<v Speaker 4>that's what Lance Armstrong was doping with.</v>

5608
02:23:23.910 --> 02:23:25.210
<v Speaker 4>Shane Mosley plop for it,</v>

5609
02:23:25.211 --> 02:23:25.390
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

5610
02:23:25.390 --> 02:23:26.330
<v Speaker 4>Moses got popcorn.</v>

5611
02:23:26.430 --> 02:23:26.731
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5612
02:23:26.731 --> 02:23:29.330
<v Speaker 4>They've found some old blood of his and I'm like,</v>

5613
02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:29.641
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

5614
02:23:29.641 --> 02:23:31.350
<v Speaker 4>let's give this a shot.</v>

5615
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

5616
02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:33.330
<v Speaker 4>it looks like a,</v>

5617
02:23:33.970 --> 02:23:35.100
<v Speaker 4>you got some weird blood dude.</v>

5618
02:23:36.420 --> 02:23:39.570
<v Speaker 4>It's 50% more blood cells in a normal person's blood.</v>

5619
02:23:39.610 --> 02:23:40.140
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

5620
02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:40.973
<v Speaker 4>How weird.</v>

5621
02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:42.870
<v Speaker 4>This has turned out to be a good fight though.</v>

5622
02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:43.733
<v Speaker 4>Very good.</v>

5623
02:23:44.610 --> 02:23:44.911
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5624
02:23:44.911 --> 02:23:46.170
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they're gonna do.</v>

5625
02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:46.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

5626
02:23:46.650 --> 02:23:50.340
<v Speaker 4>if they do wind up tests and everybody and they find out that the roster just</v>

5627
02:23:50.341 --> 02:23:52.620
<v Speaker 4>overrun with people that are on everything.</v>

5628
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:53.703
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

5629
02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:54.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

5630
02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:54.720
<v Speaker 4>if they can,</v>

5631
02:23:54.720 --> 02:23:56.190
<v Speaker 4>if they can test.</v>

5632
02:23:56.191 --> 02:23:57.750
<v Speaker 4>You said there's too many people in MMA.</v>

5633
02:23:59.060 --> 02:24:01.390
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really say good way to call the herd.</v>

5634
02:24:01.391 --> 02:24:02.660
<v Speaker 2>My friend was asking,</v>

5635
02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:04.173
<v Speaker 4>I was asking</v>

5636
02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:06.221
<v Speaker 4>what do you,</v>

5637
02:24:06.221 --> 02:24:07.054
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

5638
02:24:07.330 --> 02:24:07.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

5639
02:24:07.870 --> 02:24:08.710
<v Speaker 4>what do they do?</v>

5640
02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:09.041
<v Speaker 4>What do they,</v>

5641
02:24:09.041 --> 02:24:12.550
<v Speaker 4>what do they do if they find out like 60% of the people that cut 60% of the</v>

5642
02:24:12.551 --> 02:24:13.361
<v Speaker 4>Bible now,</v>

5643
02:24:13.361 --> 02:24:15.100
<v Speaker 4>how if they start</v>

5644
02:24:15.430 --> 02:24:16.263
<v Speaker 2>this procedure,</v>

5645
02:24:16.390 --> 02:24:17.260
<v Speaker 2>how long does it take to get there?</v>

5646
02:24:17.261 --> 02:24:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Your system?</v>

5647
02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:18.581
<v Speaker 2>Like how long will they,</v>

5648
02:24:18.581 --> 02:24:19.414
<v Speaker 2>it's a good question.</v>

5649
02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:22.920
<v Speaker 2>That's the question is if everybody cut now someone's already got to figure it</v>

5650
02:24:22.921 --> 02:24:23.651
<v Speaker 2>out too late.</v>

5651
02:24:23.651 --> 02:24:23.951
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5652
02:24:23.951 --> 02:24:27.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's some fucking guy out there that knows his shit,</v>

5653
02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:28.181
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5654
02:24:28.181 --> 02:24:30.980
<v Speaker 2>and it's like as listen to the ball.</v>

5655
02:24:30.981 --> 02:24:31.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5656
02:24:31.250 --> 02:24:32.083
<v Speaker 2>I talk about it.</v>

5657
02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:34.810
<v Speaker 2>There's always someone a step ahead because someone's got to,</v>

5658
02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:38.410
<v Speaker 2>someone's still got to sell that shit and figure everything out.</v>

5659
02:24:38.411 --> 02:24:38.741
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

5660
02:24:38.741 --> 02:24:39.120
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

5661
02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:39.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5662
02:24:39.350 --> 02:24:40.240
<v Speaker 2>like a guarantee.</v>

5663
02:24:40.241 --> 02:24:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Everything's already been</v>

5664
02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:42.850
<v Speaker 4>very well planned.</v>

5665
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.691
<v Speaker 4>I wonder,</v>

5666
02:24:43.691 --> 02:24:47.870
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if there's a new thing that they can take now that you can't test for.</v>

5667
02:24:48.090 --> 02:24:49.680
<v Speaker 2>Lopers are always ahead of the system.</v>

5668
02:24:50.100 --> 02:24:50.701
<v Speaker 2>They have to be,</v>

5669
02:24:50.701 --> 02:24:50.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5670
02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:51.930
<v Speaker 2>by definition there,</v>

5671
02:24:51.931 --> 02:24:54.030
<v Speaker 2>because people have to do things.</v>

5672
02:24:54.060 --> 02:24:57.660
<v Speaker 2>That is the system that is the system is people do stuff,</v>

5673
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.501
<v Speaker 2>they do stuff,</v>

5674
02:24:58.501 --> 02:25:00.900
<v Speaker 2>it's illegal and the the testers figure it out and catch them,</v>

5675
02:25:00.901 --> 02:25:02.610
<v Speaker 2>but they're always lagging behind.</v>

5676
02:25:03.060 --> 02:25:03.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5677
02:25:03.550 --> 02:25:05.250
<v Speaker 2>it was originally made EPO for,</v>

5678
02:25:05.251 --> 02:25:09.000
<v Speaker 2>for leukemia patients that would have trouble keeping the red blood cell count</v>

5679
02:25:09.001 --> 02:25:09.530
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

5680
02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:13.620
<v Speaker 2>So never occurred to them that somebody would take that in order to help their</v>

5681
02:25:13.621 --> 02:25:14.190
<v Speaker 2>endurance.</v>

5682
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:16.950
<v Speaker 2>And then they started taking it now that'd make a test for it.</v>

5683
02:25:16.951 --> 02:25:18.360
<v Speaker 2>So that's the cycle.</v>

5684
02:25:18.361 --> 02:25:21.510
<v Speaker 2>They make it for something and then someone figures out how to cheat with it and</v>

5685
02:25:21.511 --> 02:25:22.530
<v Speaker 2>then they figure out how to catch him.</v>

5686
02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:26.260
<v Speaker 2>The catchers are the people who are trying to catch the people are always at the</v>

5687
02:25:26.261 --> 02:25:27.340
<v Speaker 2>end of the process.</v>

5688
02:25:27.650 --> 02:25:30.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm ignorant as to how it's all done.</v>

5689
02:25:30.381 --> 02:25:32.240
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know whether or not,</v>

5690
02:25:32.241 --> 02:25:33.380
<v Speaker 1>this is a stupid question,</v>

5691
02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:38.120
<v Speaker 1>but is there like a point in time where they run out of things?</v>

5692
02:25:38.121 --> 02:25:38.530
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

5693
02:25:38.530 --> 02:25:42.710
<v Speaker 1>there's no more things that you could add to the human body that they haven't</v>

5694
02:25:42.740 --> 02:25:43.850
<v Speaker 1>already discovered.</v>

5695
02:25:44.060 --> 02:25:47.790
<v Speaker 1>So there's no more things that you could add that they can't test for like that.</v>

5696
02:25:47.900 --> 02:25:48.980
<v Speaker 1>The clear stuff.</v>

5697
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:51.770
<v Speaker 1>Part of w we had that guy on the podcast,</v>

5698
02:25:51.771 --> 02:25:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Victor Conte,</v>

5699
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:54.470
<v Speaker 1>and he was talking about the whole ball call scandal.</v>

5700
02:25:54.710 --> 02:25:58.850
<v Speaker 1>And what I found really interesting about it was that he just had altered some</v>

5701
02:25:58.851 --> 02:26:02.210
<v Speaker 1>stuff and made it so it was not within their testing parameters,</v>

5702
02:26:02.211 --> 02:26:03.080
<v Speaker 1>but still effective.</v>

5703
02:26:03.081 --> 02:26:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5704
02:26:03.500 --> 02:26:04.580
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point in time.</v>

5705
02:26:04.581 --> 02:26:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Did they run out of those variations?</v>

5706
02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5707
02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:08.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

5708
02:26:08.650 --> 02:26:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I find it hard to believe.</v>

5709
02:26:10.990 --> 02:26:11.823
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

5710
02:26:13.150 --> 02:26:13.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5711
02:26:13.690 --> 02:26:18.010
<v Speaker 2>McKell Ferrara who was McKella Ferrari was a doctor who dealt with Lance</v>

5712
02:26:18.010 --> 02:26:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Armstrong and helped him through his tour de France wins of course,</v>

5713
02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:21.641
<v Speaker 2>helped him.</v>

5714
02:26:21.641 --> 02:26:23.530
<v Speaker 2>Dope was asked one time,</v>

5715
02:26:23.531 --> 02:26:25.910
<v Speaker 2>have we seen the limits of human endurance,</v>

5716
02:26:25.911 --> 02:26:28.180
<v Speaker 2>of the capacity for human endurance?</v>

5717
02:26:28.510 --> 02:26:30.010
<v Speaker 2>And he turned to the guy and he laughed and goes,</v>

5718
02:26:30.160 --> 02:26:31.150
<v Speaker 2>we're nowhere near it.</v>

5719
02:26:32.340 --> 02:26:33.131
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>

5720
02:26:33.131 --> 02:26:35.620
<v Speaker 2>they're always going to come up with something because it's just,</v>

5721
02:26:35.860 --> 02:26:36.693
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

5722
02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:41.870
<v Speaker 1>what I hear though is genetic engineering and I hear things like mio step,</v>

5723
02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:42.730
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

5724
02:26:42.730 --> 02:26:42.951
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

5725
02:26:42.951 --> 02:26:45.200
<v Speaker 1>kick myostatin inhibitors and all the,</v>

5726
02:26:45.201 --> 02:26:48.170
<v Speaker 1>all the different shit that they're inevitably going to come up with down the</v>

5727
02:26:48.171 --> 02:26:48.680
<v Speaker 1>pipe.</v>

5728
02:26:48.680 --> 02:26:52.610
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder if like they're going to be able to come up with new steroids</v>

5729
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:56.090
<v Speaker 1>because I think genetic engineering is a completely different ballgame.</v>

5730
02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:56.791
<v Speaker 2>Completely different.</v>

5731
02:26:56.791 --> 02:26:57.140
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

5732
02:26:57.140 --> 02:26:57.650
<v Speaker 2>but no.</v>

5733
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:58.351
<v Speaker 2>Also think about it.</v>

5734
02:26:58.351 --> 02:26:58.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

5735
02:26:58.590 --> 02:26:59.820
<v Speaker 2>will there be a cure for cancer?</v>

5736
02:27:00.420 --> 02:27:00.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5737
02:27:00.661 --> 02:27:01.231
<v Speaker 2>We can sit her and go,</v>

5738
02:27:01.231 --> 02:27:01.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

5739
02:27:01.381 --> 02:27:01.800
<v Speaker 2>Eventually.</v>

5740
02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:03.480
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] so they got to come up with something,</v>

5741
02:27:03.690 --> 02:27:03.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5742
02:27:03.970 --> 02:27:05.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like saying whether it be new stories.</v>

5743
02:27:05.761 --> 02:27:06.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5744
02:27:06.001 --> 02:27:08.130
<v Speaker 2>will there be new medical advances for other things?</v>

5745
02:27:08.131 --> 02:27:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5746
02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Then they're going to be new ways to improve the human body.</v>

5747
02:27:11.700 --> 02:27:16.410
<v Speaker 2>And I think we'll be playing this game probably the rest of our lives.</v>

5748
02:27:16.411 --> 02:27:16.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5749
02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:17.431
<v Speaker 2>I wonder,</v>

5750
02:27:17.431 --> 02:27:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I wonder they have robots doing this shit until it's like the Fox intro in real</v>

5751
02:27:20.611 --> 02:27:20.970
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

5752
02:27:20.970 --> 02:27:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Like fuck fucking robot.</v>

5753
02:27:25.290 --> 02:27:25.651
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

5754
02:27:25.651 --> 02:27:25.861

02:27:25.861 --> 02:27:27.510
<v Speaker 2>you do had to bring that up.</v>

5756
02:27:27.660 --> 02:27:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I hate those fucking robot goofy picking up robots and slam.</v>

5757
02:27:32.351 --> 02:27:32.800
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

5758
02:27:32.800 --> 02:27:34.770
<v Speaker 2>what looks like a transformers commercial?</v>

5759
02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:34.931
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5760

02:27:39.430 --> 02:27:40.263
<v Speaker 2>Wolverine Guy,</v>

5764
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Jack Knew Jackman.</v>

5765
02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:44.430
<v Speaker 2>There was robot fighters.</v>

5766
02:27:47.580 --> 02:27:49.330
<v Speaker 2>Woo fucking funded that movement.</v>

5767
02:27:49.980 --> 02:27:51.360
<v Speaker 2>That shit is so terrible.</v>

5768
02:27:51.510 --> 02:27:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

5769
02:27:52.140 --> 02:27:53.820

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5772
02:27:55.791 --> 02:27:56.870
<v Speaker 1>especially with logos.</v>

5773
02:27:57.410 --> 02:28:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you find a difference in certain logos being more slippery than others?</v>

5774
02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:01.041
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5775
02:28:01.041 --> 02:28:01.690
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5776
02:28:01.690 --> 02:28:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5777
02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.110
<v Speaker 1>it's different surface.</v>

5778
02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:05.190
<v Speaker 1>But I mean you're,</v>

5779

02:28:06.250 --> 02:28:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I get this weird heightened sensation in my feet when I'm out there and moving</v>

5781
02:28:09.160 --> 02:28:10.400
<v Speaker 2>and like I,</v>

5782
02:28:10.410 --> 02:28:12.100
<v Speaker 2>if I just step on that canvas,</v>

5783
02:28:12.101 --> 02:28:12.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5784
02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:13.293
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5785

<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

5786
02:28:13.871 --> 02:28:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I got Boehner in my feet,</v>

5787
02:28:15.390 --> 02:28:18.130
<v Speaker 2>get all tingling and I'm just dancing and I just feel this.</v>

5788
02:28:18.940 --> 02:28:19.773
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

5789
02:28:19.850 --> 02:28:20.621
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird,</v>

5790
02:28:20.621 --> 02:28:20.891
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

5791
02:28:20.891 --> 02:28:22.140
<v Speaker 2>you do feel a</v>

5792
02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:22.640
<v Speaker 3>definite,</v>

5793
02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:25.310
<v Speaker 3>especially if it was blood on it and blood is the body's best lubricant,</v>

5794
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:25.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5795
02:28:25.581 --> 02:28:27.050
<v Speaker 3>like that's the fucking,</v>

5796
02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:28.400
<v Speaker 3>that shit gets on something</v>

5797
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.943
<v Speaker 3>very slippery.</v>

5798
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:34.220
<v Speaker 3>It's why it's interesting when guys get caught,</v>

5799
02:28:34.221 --> 02:28:35.810
<v Speaker 3>it actually makes them easier to choke.</v>

5800
02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:36.740
<v Speaker 3>Can wait,</v>

5801
02:28:36.740 --> 02:28:38.600
<v Speaker 3>slide things under their chin easier.</v>

5802
02:28:40.750 --> 02:28:42.100
<v Speaker 3>This a good fucking fight.</v>

5803
02:28:42.101 --> 02:28:43.480
<v Speaker 3>Calvin's come on strong.</v>

5804
02:28:43.481 --> 02:28:44.380
<v Speaker 3>Nice body shots.</v>

5805
02:28:44.490 --> 02:28:45.160
<v Speaker 3>Ooh.</v>

5806
02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:46.810
<v Speaker 3>Whipped that right hand to the body.</v>

5807
02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:50.360
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

5808
02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:51.930
<v Speaker 3>And that's what I mean guys cooked,</v>

5809
02:28:51.940 --> 02:28:54.650
<v Speaker 3>they make these horrible cuts and they perform great.</v>

5810
02:28:54.680 --> 02:28:55.400
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

5811
02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:56.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just hard to say,</v>

5812
02:28:57.030 --> 02:28:57.863
<v Speaker 3>come on motherfucker.</v>

5813
02:28:58.310 --> 02:28:59.570
<v Speaker 3>He's got a brown great.</v>

5814
02:28:59.571 --> 02:29:00.830
<v Speaker 3>His back's up against wall.</v>

5815
02:29:00.831 --> 02:29:03.260
<v Speaker 3>The UFC fucking hates it when guys miss.</v>

5816
02:29:03.261 --> 02:29:03.950
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>

5817
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:04.311
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>

5818
02:29:04.311 --> 02:29:05.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean Belterra it's it too.</v>

5819
02:29:05.481 --> 02:29:06.990
<v Speaker 3>This is third.</v>

5820
02:29:06.991 --> 02:29:07.730
<v Speaker 3>They hate it.</v>

5821
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:09.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he missed weight last time he made it.</v>

5822
02:29:09.741 --> 02:29:11.210
<v Speaker 3>He just needed a second attempt.</v>

5823
02:29:11.870 --> 02:29:12.021
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

5824
02:29:12.021 --> 02:29:13.430
<v Speaker 3>I know he did and that was there.</v>

5825
02:29:13.650 --> 02:29:13.980
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

5826
02:29:13.980 --> 02:29:15.590
<v Speaker 3>but this is his first.</v>

5827
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:21.170
<v Speaker 3>We fought at one 85 on the show and so he's fighting at one 70 here.</v>

5828
02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:23.630
<v Speaker 3>He's a one 71 70,</v>

5829
02:29:23.631 --> 02:29:24.770
<v Speaker 3>but he's got to do it more,</v>

5830
02:29:25.130 --> 02:29:27.380
<v Speaker 3>more correctly and more with more discipline.</v>

5831
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:27.651
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

5832
02:29:27.651 --> 02:29:28.340
<v Speaker 3>high kick.</v>

5833
02:29:28.340 --> 02:29:29.720
<v Speaker 3>But he's still a bad mother fucker.</v>

5834
02:29:29.721 --> 02:29:30.091
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

5835
02:29:30.091 --> 02:29:33.830
<v Speaker 3>Is those two high kicks in a row suite and he still has good footwork for the</v>

5836
02:29:33.831 --> 02:29:35.150
<v Speaker 3>beginning of fight to the end of the fight.</v>

5837
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.690
<v Speaker 3>Good footwork.</v>

5838
02:29:35.690 --> 02:29:36.523
<v Speaker 3>Very good.</v>

5839
02:29:36.620 --> 02:29:37.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5840
02:29:37.070 --> 02:29:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Light on his feet.</v>

5841
02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:39.920
<v Speaker 3>He's keep racking that thing.</v>

5842
02:29:39.930 --> 02:29:40.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5843
02:29:40.170 --> 02:29:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>

5844
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:42.740
<v Speaker 3>And they were exchanging them back and forth.</v>

5845
02:29:42.741 --> 02:29:43.790
<v Speaker 3>Something big and fighting.</v>

5846
02:29:43.791 --> 02:29:44.511
<v Speaker 3>Don't set a pace.</v>

5847
02:29:44.511 --> 02:29:47.240
<v Speaker 3>You can't keep something in the first round you can't do in the third round.</v>

5848
02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

5849
02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:49.040
<v Speaker 3>He kept it up all three rounds.</v>

5850
02:29:49.041 --> 02:29:49.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

5851
02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:49.821
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>

5852
02:29:49.821 --> 02:29:51.110
<v Speaker 3>And Move Soki didn't.</v>

5853
02:29:51.800 --> 02:29:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Interesting fight man.</v>

5854
02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:53.931
<v Speaker 3>Interesting fight.</v>

5855
02:29:53.931 --> 02:29:54.800
<v Speaker 3>I wonder who got that.</v>

5856
02:29:55.130 --> 02:29:56.540
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's the one thing that goes through my head.</v>

5857
02:29:56.541 --> 02:29:58.880
<v Speaker 3>The most of the fight is don't stop moving.</v>

5858
02:29:59.300 --> 02:29:59.870
<v Speaker 3>Stop moving.</v>

5859
02:29:59.870 --> 02:30:00.703
<v Speaker 3>Don't stop moving.</v>

5860
02:30:00.800 --> 02:30:01.191
<v Speaker 3>I kicked,</v>

5861
02:30:01.191 --> 02:30:03.110
<v Speaker 3>I landed 43 lake kicks I think.</v>

5862
02:30:03.140 --> 02:30:03.921
<v Speaker 3>I think a area,</v>

5863
02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:04.191
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

5864
02:30:04.191 --> 02:30:06.590
<v Speaker 3>He said my last fight that was just legs.</v>

5865
02:30:06.591 --> 02:30:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I kicked him in the body and the head a little bit but I mean Atlanta at 43 I</v>

5866
02:30:10.031 --> 02:30:11.040
<v Speaker 3>and the whole time I was just going</v>

5867
02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:13.640
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

5868
02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:15.840
<v Speaker 3>I think I landed one every 20 seconds they broke it down.</v>

5869
02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I was always thinking if I'm hitting him he's not hitting me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's fucking it.</v>

5908
02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:25.110
<v Speaker 3>I've never had something made me so strong in my entire life,</v>

5909
02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:25.351

5910
02:31:25.351 --> 02:31:26.820
<v Speaker 3>obviously besides wrestling,</v>

5911
02:31:26.850 --> 02:31:27.683
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

5912
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:29.070
<v Speaker 3>there's no,</v>

5913
02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:29.611
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

5914
02:31:29.611 --> 02:31:30.444
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

5915
02:31:31.380 --> 02:31:33.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't not have the training drilling.</v>

5916
02:31:33.211 --> 02:31:35.400
<v Speaker 3>You have to Joe something 10 that you want to mass master anything.</v>

5917
02:31:35.401 --> 02:31:36.720
<v Speaker 3>You have to drill it for 10,000 hours.</v>

5918
02:31:36.810 --> 02:31:37.530
<v Speaker 3>It's true.</v>

5919
02:31:37.530 --> 02:31:40.530
<v Speaker 3>You know you have to do everything and we've got so much shit to try and master</v>

5920
02:31:40.531 --> 02:31:41.340
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

5921
02:31:41.340 --> 02:31:42.870
<v Speaker 3>But that sounds crazy.</v>

5922
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:43.331
<v Speaker 3>So you're,</v>

5923
02:31:43.331 --> 02:31:47.850
<v Speaker 3>you're grabbing this giant barrel and what are you specifically trying to do</v>

5924
02:31:47.851 --> 02:31:48.684
<v Speaker 3>with it?</v>

5925
02:31:49.020 --> 02:31:50.250
<v Speaker 3>Think about from a clinch,</v>

5926
02:31:50.280 --> 02:31:51.960
<v Speaker 3>you know how like Johnny Hendricks huge though,</v>

5927
02:31:51.961 --> 02:31:52.201
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

5928
02:31:52.201 --> 02:31:53.610
<v Speaker 3>Can you even get your arms around it?</v>

5929
02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:55.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a top on it.</v>

5930
02:31:55.380 --> 02:31:55.920
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

5931
02:31:55.920 --> 02:31:57.030
<v Speaker 3>And then you sit there and you,</v>

5932
02:31:57.150 --> 02:31:59.130
<v Speaker 3>you grab it and you grab it here and you twist it.</v>

5933
02:31:59.250 --> 02:32:02.640
<v Speaker 3>So you've got 500 pounds that you're twisting back and forth or you're pushing</v>

5934
02:32:02.810 --> 02:32:05.790
<v Speaker 3>and pulling in all the muscles throughout the whole part of it are,</v>

5935
02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:08.160

02:35:56.611 --> 02:35:57.011
<v Speaker 3>it actually,</v>

6122
02:35:57.011 --> 02:35:57.181
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

6123
02:35:57.181 --> 02:35:57.730

<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>

6126
02:35:59.450 --> 02:36:00.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6127
02:36:00.240 --> 02:36:00.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

6128
02:36:00.570 --> 02:36:00.720
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

6129
02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:02.010
<v Speaker 3>if someone weighs 125 pounds,</v>

6130
02:36:02.011 --> 02:36:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna fucking sent him for a ride.</v>

6131
02:36:04.090 --> 02:36:04.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6132
02:36:04.450 --> 02:36:05.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6133
02:36:05.110 --> 02:36:08.230
<v Speaker 1>I think what you had there was 325 pounds,</v>

6134
02:36:08.270 --> 02:36:09.103
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

6135
02:36:09.330 --> 02:36:10.163
<v Speaker 1>I can text,</v>

6136
02:36:10.170 --> 02:36:10.450
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

6137
02:36:10.450 --> 02:36:15.130
<v Speaker 1>let's figure it out because it's one 45 plate on each side with an Olympic</v>

6138
02:36:15.131 --> 02:36:17.200
<v Speaker 1>barbell is 135 pounds.</v>

6139
02:36:17.230 --> 02:36:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

6140
02:36:17.520 --> 02:36:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

6141
02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:20.500
<v Speaker 1>And then you add to 30 fives on each side,</v>

6142
02:36:20.501 --> 02:36:22.360
<v Speaker 1>which is one 40 to that.</v>

6143
02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:27.540
<v Speaker 1>So you have two 75 and then you have two 20 fives on that as well.</v>

6144
02:36:28.570 --> 02:36:30.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's another 50 pounds.</v>

6145
02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6146
02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:32.320
<v Speaker 1>So that's 325 pounds.</v>

6147
02:36:32.770 --> 02:36:33.940
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking crazy.</v>

6148
02:36:34.120 --> 02:36:36.640
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of God damn wait to fuck.</v>

6149
02:36:37.420 --> 02:36:37.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6150
02:36:37.841 --> 02:36:39.120
<v Speaker 1>if you had a big girl on top of you,</v>

6151
02:36:39.121 --> 02:36:39.410
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

6152
02:36:39.410 --> 02:36:40.243
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker,</v>

6153
02:36:41.340 --> 02:36:42.490
<v Speaker 4>you can't send it in</v>

6154
02:36:45.280 --> 02:36:47.340

6155
02:36:47.370 --> 02:36:48.090

6156
02:36:48.090 --> 02:36:48.511

6161
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:51.960
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I made her a black chick.</v>

6162
02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:53.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I just throw that big.</v>

6163
02:36:53.761 --> 02:36:55.250
<v Speaker 4>I just automatically think they're best.</v>

6164
02:36:55.260 --> 02:36:56.093
<v Speaker 4>What I think</v>

6179
02:37:13.111 --> 02:37:13.420
<v Speaker 4>most</v>

6180
02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:17.090
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable styles of his fight with Dennis Seaver.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:20.990
<v Speaker 1>when he had him hurt,</v>

6184
02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:26.060
<v Speaker 1>it was so fucking accurate and just ridiculously wild.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Explosive Man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He does all of his strength and conditioning.</v>

02:37:31.671 --> 02:37:32.540
<v Speaker 1>What balancing.</v>

02:37:32.780 --> 02:37:35.780
<v Speaker 1>He'll do like weightlifting stuff while he's standing on balls and stuff,</v>

6191
02:37:35.810 --> 02:37:36.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what are those balls?</v>

6195
02:37:39.190 --> 02:37:40.550
<v Speaker 1>This is called an a medicine ball.</v>

6196
02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:42.420
<v Speaker 1>No balance balls to the wall,</v>

6197
02:37:42.470 --> 02:37:43.170
<v Speaker 1>plyo balls,</v>

<v Speaker 1>whatever you call him.</v>

6199
02:37:44.120 --> 02:37:45.470
<v Speaker 1>But he does all that stuff.</v>

6200
02:37:45.471 --> 02:37:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Like a little stand on half balls and do like kettle bells,</v>

6203
02:37:50.210 --> 02:37:51.043
<v Speaker 1>with balance.</v>

6204
02:37:52.250 --> 02:37:52.611
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy.</v>

6205
02:37:52.611 --> 02:37:52.861
<v Speaker 1>Steve.</v>

6206

<v Speaker 1>It's a motherfucker though.</v>

6207
02:37:53.871 --> 02:37:54.201
<v Speaker 1>That kid,</v>

6208
02:37:54.201 --> 02:37:56.300
<v Speaker 1>he has heavy handed man.</v>

6209
02:37:56.301 --> 02:37:57.260
<v Speaker 1>He is hard.</v>

6210
02:37:57.440 --> 02:37:58.160
<v Speaker 1>He hits hard.</v>

6211
02:37:58.160 --> 02:37:59.750
<v Speaker 1>He hit artist as a lightweight,</v>

6212
02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:00.681
<v Speaker 1>as a one.</v>

6213
02:38:00.681 --> 02:38:02.540
<v Speaker 1>He kept all that power going to 45.</v>

6214
02:38:02.540 --> 02:38:02.831
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

6215
02:38:02.831 --> 02:38:03.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a rare thing.</v>

6216
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.970
<v Speaker 1>While he's healthy,</v>

6217
02:38:04.971 --> 02:38:06.140
<v Speaker 1>he's doing it real good.</v>

6218
02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Alliance is a serious fucking team man and he,</v>

6219
02:38:08.650 --> 02:38:11.000
<v Speaker 1>he fucking knocks people out over there all the time.</v>

6220
02:38:11.001 --> 02:38:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Does he really?</v>

6221
02:38:11.550 --> 02:38:12.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

6222
02:38:13.030 --> 02:38:13.750
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

6223
02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:14.410
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

6224
02:38:14.410 --> 02:38:16.160
<v Speaker 1>he's a lot of fun to hang out with but he,</v>

6225
02:38:16.170 --> 02:38:17.600
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking savage in the gym.</v>

6226
02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:18.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6227
02:38:18.021 --> 02:38:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

6228
02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:20.450
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting guy to talk to.</v>

6229
02:38:20.451 --> 02:38:21.380
<v Speaker 1>I enjoyed talking to him.</v>

6230
02:38:21.381 --> 02:38:22.071
<v Speaker 1>Mark Smart Guy.</v>

6231
02:38:22.071 --> 02:38:22.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

6232
02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I had him on the podcast.</v>

6233
02:38:23.511 --> 02:38:24.344
<v Speaker 1>He was great.</v>

6234
02:38:24.980 --> 02:38:25.491
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

6235
02:38:25.491 --> 02:38:26.600
<v Speaker 1>he's an interesting dude,</v>

6236
02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but his fucking power is redonkulous but cub is to so awkward.</v>

6237
02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Kenny deal with the angles and the explosive.</v>

6238
02:38:34.251 --> 02:38:35.001

6239
02:38:35.001 --> 02:38:35.834
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

02:38:47.871 --> 02:38:48.800
<v Speaker 1>It is what it is.</v>

6250
02:38:48.801 --> 02:38:49.071
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6251
02:38:49.071 --> 02:38:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you get hit with that.</v>

6252
02:38:49.911 --> 02:38:50.600
<v Speaker 1>That's a wrap.</v>

6253
02:38:50.600 --> 02:38:51.920
<v Speaker 1>Your head split open.</v>

6254
02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:53.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean he covered up immediately,</v>

6255
02:38:53.570 --> 02:38:54.770
<v Speaker 1>had a big ass scar,</v>

6256
02:38:56.660 --> 02:38:59.180
<v Speaker 1>but I would like to see what would happen if that fight.</v>

6257
02:38:59.210 --> 02:39:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Well that was a different cub.</v>

6258
02:39:00.411 --> 02:39:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Swanson then too.</v>

6259
02:39:01.880 --> 02:39:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6260
02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:04.430
<v Speaker 1>although was at its peak then you still,</v>

6261
02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:06.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think although has diminished at all.</v>

6262
02:39:06.890 --> 02:39:07.820
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else has gotten better.</v>

6263
02:39:07.850 --> 02:39:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6264
02:39:08.330 --> 02:39:11.390
<v Speaker 1>he's slowed down a little bit and because he takes it,</v>

6265
02:39:11.660 --> 02:39:14.780
<v Speaker 1>he plays it a little bit more safe because he's got so much to lose and he's</v>

6266
02:39:14.781 --> 02:39:15.614
<v Speaker 1>alone and he's bigger.</v>

6267
02:39:15.980 --> 02:39:16.541
<v Speaker 1>He's gotten very,</v>

6268
02:39:16.541 --> 02:39:16.781
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

6269
02:39:16.781 --> 02:39:17.330
<v Speaker 1>it's a big,</v>

6270
02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:21.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the dude wants to go to one 55 because if he goes to one 55 he's</v>

6271
02:39:21.771 --> 02:39:24.350
<v Speaker 1>not going to have his title is title means a lot.</v>

6272
02:39:24.570 --> 02:39:24.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6273
02:39:24.860 --> 02:39:27.710
<v Speaker 1>being a world champion means a lot and as long as he can make the weight,</v>

6274
02:39:27.711 --> 02:39:28.640
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be real hard.</v>

6275
02:39:28.820 --> 02:39:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Unless they have like some sort of a super fine.</v>

6276
02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:31.701
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

6277
02:39:31.701 --> 02:39:34.610
<v Speaker 1>if they had a super fight and it was,</v>

6278
02:39:34.611 --> 02:39:36.070
<v Speaker 1>if I went on this five pound champ,</v>

6279
02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:36.351
<v Speaker 1>I lose,</v>

6280
02:39:36.351 --> 02:39:37.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm still the 45 pound champ.</v>

6281
02:39:37.521 --> 02:39:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I think he'd take that.</v>

6282
02:39:38.150 --> 02:39:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

6283
02:39:38.660 --> 02:39:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the way to do it.</v>

6284
02:39:40.040 --> 02:39:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the way to get them in.</v>

6285
02:39:42.020 --> 02:39:45.260
<v Speaker 1>But you know when a guy's like a guy like Aldo man,</v>

6286
02:39:45.261 --> 02:39:46.970
<v Speaker 1>he's a fucking hero in Brazil.</v>

6287
02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:47.840
<v Speaker 1>He's a hero.</v>

6288
02:39:48.170 --> 02:39:53.170
<v Speaker 1>He's a huge star and as a mixed martial artist man to be a world champion is</v>

6289
02:39:53.661 --> 02:39:54.494
<v Speaker 1>where it's at.</v>

6290
02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

6291
02:39:54.890 --> 02:39:56.600
<v Speaker 1>he is a world fucking champion.</v>

6292
02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:59.000
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] that's the one thing man,</v>

6293
02:39:59.001 --> 02:40:00.410
<v Speaker 1>that fucking weight cut.</v>

6294
02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:01.430
<v Speaker 1>He would,</v>

6295
02:40:01.430 --> 02:40:01.641
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

6296
02:40:01.641 --> 02:40:02.960
<v Speaker 1>if he went 55 once,</v>

6297
02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would go 55 again.</v>

6298
02:40:04.760 --> 02:40:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

6299
02:40:05.300 --> 02:40:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Cause I mean he just seems like he just gets,</v>

6300
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:07.880
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

6301
02:40:07.880 --> 02:40:08.900
<v Speaker 1>he would put on too much,</v>

6302
02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:12.080
<v Speaker 1>too much weight and then it would just be fucking death to get down.</v>

6303
02:40:12.081 --> 02:40:14.070
<v Speaker 1>But like it wasn't hard before.</v>

6304
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:16.980
<v Speaker 4>Once you taste what it's like to not cut that.</v>

6305
02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:17.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6306
02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:20.910
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to get back down again if he tasted what it's like to feel good when</v>

6307
02:40:20.911 --> 02:40:22.080
<v Speaker 4>you're actually inside.</v>

6308
02:40:22.110 --> 02:40:22.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6309
02:40:22.530 --> 02:40:23.460
<v Speaker 4>It could be a good change.</v>

6310
02:40:23.461 --> 02:40:23.970
<v Speaker 4>You never know.</v>

6311
02:40:23.970 --> 02:40:26.310
<v Speaker 4>It could be because I think there's a good chance against pedes.</v>

6312
02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:27.810
<v Speaker 4>I think he has a good chance and that fire,</v>

6313
02:40:28.890 --> 02:40:29.250
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6314
02:40:29.250 --> 02:40:29.771
<v Speaker 4>else has a good,</v>

6315
02:40:29.771 --> 02:40:31.080
<v Speaker 4>a chance to have fight pedis</v>

6316
02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:35.030
<v Speaker 4>pedis as a good job.</v>

6317
02:40:35.050 --> 02:40:35.180
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

6318
02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:36.013
<v Speaker 4>It's a great fight.</v>

6319
02:40:36.220 --> 02:40:38.510
<v Speaker 4>Although it goes up and gets Kol by Pedis,</v>

6320
02:40:38.540 --> 02:40:38.881
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6321
02:40:38.881 --> 02:40:41.010
<v Speaker 4>but pedes said he could make one 45 man,</v>

6322
02:40:41.640 --> 02:40:42.930
<v Speaker 4>he said he could make it a pet.</v>

6323
02:40:42.931 --> 02:40:44.140
<v Speaker 4>This is not a huge 55.</v>

6324
02:40:44.310 --> 02:40:44.760
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

6325
02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:44.941
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

6326
02:40:44.941 --> 02:40:46.530
<v Speaker 4>He's not fucking slick man.</v>

6327
02:40:46.531 --> 02:40:49.390
<v Speaker 4>Jesus really good on the ground too.</v>

6328
02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:53.400
<v Speaker 4>That's what people sleep on when he caught Henderson with that arm bar.</v>

6329
02:40:53.550 --> 02:40:58.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean that was a standard Bjj one o one on bar in the middle there some quick</v>

6330
02:40:59.080 --> 02:41:00.870
<v Speaker 4>but done well done.</v>

6331
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:01.560
<v Speaker 4>Perfectly.</v>

6332
02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:02.550
<v Speaker 4>Nice adjustment.</v>

6333
02:41:02.760 --> 02:41:04.170
<v Speaker 4>He changed the angle,</v>

6334
02:41:04.450 --> 02:41:05.310
<v Speaker 4>which is what a blue belt.</v>

6335
02:41:05.370 --> 02:41:08.730
<v Speaker 4>I think they were saying it's a purple belt and it was just a,</v>

6336
02:41:08.731 --> 02:41:11.760
<v Speaker 4>it was a fucking basic drilled and yeah,</v>

6337
02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:12.300
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

6338
02:41:12.300 --> 02:41:13.590
<v Speaker 4>it's why they do it that way.</v>

6339
02:41:13.620 --> 02:41:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6340
02:41:14.210 --> 02:41:14.910
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

6341
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:16.140
<v Speaker 4>that's why we do it like that.</v>

6342
02:41:16.510 --> 02:41:18.000
<v Speaker 4>He's just fast as fuck man.</v>

6343
02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:19.380
<v Speaker 4>He's fast as fuck with everything.</v>

6344
02:41:19.890 --> 02:41:24.890
<v Speaker 4>But he tore his patella tendon and he tours LCL and had it all stitched back up</v>

6345
02:41:25.381 --> 02:41:25.771
<v Speaker 4>and shit.</v>

6346
02:41:25.771 --> 02:41:26.700
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

6347
02:41:26.701 --> 02:41:29.340
<v Speaker 4>that's why he's doing this ultimate fighter with Gill.</v>

6348
02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:30.653
<v Speaker 4>It gives some time,</v>

6349
02:41:31.050 --> 02:41:32.430
<v Speaker 4>give us some time to heal,</v>

6350
02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:34.230
<v Speaker 4>get it all back in order.</v>

6351
02:41:34.231 --> 02:41:34.711
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

6352
02:41:34.711 --> 02:41:34.980
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6353
02:41:34.980 --> 02:41:36.870
<v Speaker 4>eventually fight Melendez for the title,</v>

6354
02:41:36.871 --> 02:41:38.670
<v Speaker 4>which will be a very fun fight.</v>

6355
02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:39.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6356
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:39.720
<v Speaker 4>it's gonna be awesome.</v>

6357
02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Gilbert's a fucking beast.</v>

6358
02:41:43.290 --> 02:41:43.650
<v Speaker 4>But that,</v>

6359
02:41:43.650 --> 02:41:44.100
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

6360
02:41:44.100 --> 02:41:44.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6361
02:41:44.850 --> 02:41:45.450
<v Speaker 4>Gilbert,</v>

6362
02:41:45.450 --> 02:41:47.550
<v Speaker 4>that shows you how crazy he is.</v>

6363
02:41:47.610 --> 02:41:50.790
<v Speaker 4>Cause he could have fought Diego Sanchez in a safe way.</v>

6364
02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:51.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6365
02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:54.760
<v Speaker 4>He could've just kept Diego at bay and to Mexicans.</v>

6366
02:41:55.980 --> 02:41:56.813
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

6367
02:41:56.910 --> 02:41:57.510
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

6368
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.871
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

6369
02:41:57.871 --> 02:41:58.704
<v Speaker 4>that was just,</v>

6370
02:41:58.720 --> 02:41:59.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6371
02:41:59.050 --> 02:41:59.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6372
02:41:59.671 --> 02:42:00.590
<v Speaker 4>it's not being racist.</v>

6373
02:42:00.591 --> 02:42:01.291
<v Speaker 4>I'm Mexican.</v>

6374

02:42:02.100 --> 02:42:02.740
<v Speaker 4>same difference.</v>

6377
02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:03.573
<v Speaker 4>Nothing wrong.</v>

6378
02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:04.703
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

02:42:05.310 --> 02:42:06.540
<v Speaker 4>They're both proud Mexicans.</v>

6381
02:42:06.541 --> 02:42:06.751
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6382
02:42:06.751 --> 02:42:08.730
<v Speaker 4>that's what he said when I interviewed him after the fight.</v>

6383
02:42:09.030 --> 02:42:09.420
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

6384
02:42:09.420 --> 02:42:10.650
<v Speaker 4>that's how Mexicans fight.</v>

6385
02:42:10.740 --> 02:42:11.490
<v Speaker 4>It's true.</v>

<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

6588
02:47:24.170 --> 02:47:24.751
<v Speaker 4>What is it called?</v>

6589
02:47:24.751 --> 02:47:25.021
<v Speaker 4>Jamie?</v>

6590
02:47:25.021 --> 02:47:26.490
<v Speaker 4>Fact artifact.</v>

6591
02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:27.353
<v Speaker 4>That's what the band,</v>

6592
02:47:27.420 --> 02:47:28.020
<v Speaker 4>the movie,</v>

6593
02:47:28.020 --> 02:47:29.520
<v Speaker 4>the movie is called about his band.</v>

6594
02:47:29.950 --> 02:47:31.950
<v Speaker 4>We had some huge struggles.</v>

6595
02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:36.240
<v Speaker 4>Is that the movie about the financial issues with getting sued for $30 million?</v>

6596
02:47:36.570 --> 02:47:36.960
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

6597
02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:37.793
<v Speaker 4>by whom?</v>

6598
02:47:38.280 --> 02:47:38.581
<v Speaker 4>Record?</v>

6599
02:47:38.581 --> 02:47:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Company label.</v>

6600
02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:41.070
<v Speaker 4>It's like apparently it's crazy.</v>

6601
02:47:41.130 --> 02:47:43.470
<v Speaker 4>They way they do math like they do.</v>

6602
02:47:43.730 --> 02:47:45.260
<v Speaker 4>It's just fun off the so,</v>

6603
02:47:45.540 --> 02:47:49.380
<v Speaker 4>well I've heard it before like Courtney love wrote a whole piece on at once</v>

6604
02:47:49.560 --> 02:47:53.340
<v Speaker 4>about the way they do the accounting so that you never,</v>

6605
02:47:53.341 --> 02:47:56.670
<v Speaker 4>it never looks like they've made money so they never have to pay you.</v>

6606
02:47:57.130 --> 02:47:59.520
<v Speaker 4>Like the only way you make money is when you're touring.</v>

6607
02:47:59.670 --> 02:48:00.600
<v Speaker 4>That's when you make money.</v>

6608
02:48:00.601 --> 02:48:05.160
<v Speaker 4>But record sales go almost entirely to the record company and themselves and</v>

6609
02:48:05.161 --> 02:48:07.740
<v Speaker 4>they have their own wacky ways of deciding.</v>

6610
02:48:07.741 --> 02:48:08.460
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6611
02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:09.480
<v Speaker 4>it's like Hollywood,</v>

6612
02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:10.490
<v Speaker 4>Hollywood.</v>

6613
02:48:10.490 --> 02:48:13.900
<v Speaker 2>What I've heard a lot is is any money they spend on promoting your album,</v>

6614
02:48:13.901 --> 02:48:17.050
<v Speaker 2>they consider it a loss and they'll call all these scenes promotional expenses,</v>

6615
02:48:17.440 --> 02:48:22.150
<v Speaker 2>so it's everybody you're paying basically for everybody who works for the label</v>

6616
02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:24.670
<v Speaker 2>because that's rational expense for your album.</v>

6617
02:48:24.680 --> 02:48:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Hilaire I've heard that a lot.</v>

6618
02:48:25.930 --> 02:48:26.990
<v Speaker 2>That shit as Lucas too.</v>

6619
02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:28.660
<v Speaker 2>I saw them</v>

6620
02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:31.021
<v Speaker 4>the first time I saw him,</v>

6621
02:48:31.021 --> 02:48:31.854
<v Speaker 4>they sounded great.</v>

6622
02:48:31.890 --> 02:48:32.640
<v Speaker 4>Jared led it signage,</v>

6623
02:48:32.640 --> 02:48:33.510
<v Speaker 4>just fucking awesome.</v>

6624
02:48:33.511 --> 02:48:35.340
<v Speaker 4>Then I saw him at Tahoe and they can,</v>

6625
02:48:35.341 --> 02:48:38.360
<v Speaker 4>he was trying to sing on his own without like auto tune or something and sound</v>

6626
02:48:38.370 --> 02:48:39.050
<v Speaker 4>flux.</v>

6627
02:48:39.050 --> 02:48:39.883
<v Speaker 2>I left.</v>

6628
02:48:40.640 --> 02:48:43.370
<v Speaker 2>You walked out and then they were terrible.</v>

6629
02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:44.380
<v Speaker 4>They were so bad.</v>

6630
02:48:44.730 --> 02:48:45.250
<v Speaker 4>It was awful.</v>

6631
02:48:45.250 --> 02:48:45.911
<v Speaker 4>When in doubt,</v>

6632
02:48:45.911 --> 02:48:47.050
<v Speaker 4>use autotune son.</v>

6633
02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:47.531
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

6634
02:48:47.531 --> 02:48:48.364
<v Speaker 4>here we go.</v>

6635
02:48:49.350 --> 02:48:50.740
<v Speaker 4>Chairman Stevens and Cub Swanson.</v>

6636
02:48:50.770 --> 02:48:51.310
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

6637
02:48:51.310 --> 02:48:54.940
<v Speaker 4>Cub is quick man and he keep,</v>

6638
02:48:54.941 --> 02:48:56.710
<v Speaker 4>keep that quickness up for three rounds.</v>

6639
02:48:56.890 --> 02:48:58.810
<v Speaker 4>The real question is can you keep it up for five?</v>

6640
02:48:58.870 --> 02:48:59.240
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

6641
02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:04.240
<v Speaker 4>he's got such a explosion based style where he leaps in a lot with shit.</v>

6642
02:49:05.610 --> 02:49:06.430
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>

6643
02:49:06.430 --> 02:49:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy with a good kick there.</v>

6644
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.460
<v Speaker 5>Ooh,</v>

6645
02:49:08.460 --> 02:49:09.690
<v Speaker 5>Jeremy Hits so fucking hard.</v>

6646
02:49:09.691 --> 02:49:10.860
<v Speaker 5>Everything's your tire flat.</v>

6647
02:49:10.980 --> 02:49:12.300
<v Speaker 5>Everything Jeremy does is heavy.</v>

6648
02:49:12.301 --> 02:49:12.941
<v Speaker 5>His kicks in,</v>

6649
02:49:12.941 --> 02:49:13.711
<v Speaker 5>his punches are very,</v>

6650
02:49:13.711 --> 02:49:14.280
<v Speaker 5>very heavy.</v>

6651
02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:15.720
<v Speaker 5>He's got a very good chin too.</v>

6652
02:49:15.810 --> 02:49:17.550
<v Speaker 5>Very rarely do you see him get stunned.</v>

6653
02:49:18.690 --> 02:49:18.841
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

6654
02:49:18.841 --> 02:49:20.820
<v Speaker 5>he got knocked out by Eve Edwards,</v>

6655
02:49:20.821 --> 02:49:24.180
<v Speaker 5>but eve just caught them perfect and caught him when he was running in,</v>

6656
02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:25.080
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

6657
02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:27.390
<v Speaker 5>he was attacking and eve,</v>

6658
02:49:27.391 --> 02:49:30.300
<v Speaker 5>just time to right hand is perfectly placed hook</v>

6659
02:49:31.950 --> 02:49:34.980
<v Speaker 5>and that was what facilitated him going down to one 45</v>

6660
02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:38.750
<v Speaker 4>but you know anybody who lost three in a row at that point.</v>

6661
02:49:38.800 --> 02:49:39.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6662
02:49:39.240 --> 02:49:39.710
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

6663
02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:42.500
<v Speaker 4>Anybody running in to something and he just,</v>

6664
02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:43.513
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6665
02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:44.181
<v Speaker 4>shit happens.</v>

6666
02:49:44.181 --> 02:49:44.750
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

6667
02:49:44.750 --> 02:49:45.380
<v Speaker 4>like uh,</v>

6668
02:49:45.380 --> 02:49:46.790
<v Speaker 4>Benevidez and mighty mouse,</v>

6669
02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:47.420
<v Speaker 4>mighty mouse.</v>

6670
02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:49.970
<v Speaker 4>It's very rare that mighty mouse knock guys out with one punch.</v>

6671
02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:53.150
<v Speaker 4>But Benevidez just walked into it and boom,</v>

6672
02:49:53.180 --> 02:49:54.470
<v Speaker 4>he hit me with the same exact punch.</v>

6673
02:49:54.471 --> 02:49:55.580
<v Speaker 4>I ran into the same shit.</v>

6674
02:49:55.790 --> 02:49:56.570
<v Speaker 4>Knock me down.</v>

6675
02:49:56.570 --> 02:49:56.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

6676
02:49:56.750 --> 02:49:57.291
<v Speaker 4>didn't knock me out,</v>

6677
02:49:57.291 --> 02:49:57.650
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

6678
02:49:57.650 --> 02:49:57.900
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

6679
02:49:57.900 --> 02:49:58.310
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

6680
02:49:58.310 --> 02:49:59.300
<v Speaker 4>he's very quick,</v>

6681
02:49:59.330 --> 02:50:00.200
<v Speaker 4>very quick.</v>

6682
02:50:02.010 --> 02:50:02.880
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculously quick.</v>

6683
02:50:02.881 --> 02:50:03.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6684
02:50:03.120 --> 02:50:04.980
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about Simon Marcus and Joe Schilling.</v>

6685
02:50:04.981 --> 02:50:08.970
<v Speaker 4>That's a perfect example that you ran out of trying to get that point back</v>

6686
02:50:08.971 --> 02:50:13.650
<v Speaker 4>because they took a point away from him for the mouth guard and Schilling just</v>

6687
02:50:13.651 --> 02:50:14.131
<v Speaker 4>caught him.</v>

6688
02:50:14.131 --> 02:50:14.940
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>

6689
02:50:14.940 --> 02:50:16.980
<v Speaker 4>There was two in that Wayne Barrett,</v>

6690
02:50:16.981 --> 02:50:17.551
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>

6691
02:50:17.551 --> 02:50:19.050
<v Speaker 4>The guy was chasing after him.</v>

6692
02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:20.700
<v Speaker 4>He caught him in mid air with a hook dude.</v>

6693
02:50:20.701 --> 02:50:21.550
<v Speaker 4>That was fucking night.</v>

6694
02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:22.710
<v Speaker 4>Like watching duck hunt.</v>

6695
02:50:22.810 --> 02:50:23.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah</v>

6696
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:26.423
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

6697
02:50:27.530 --> 02:50:27.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6698
02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:30.900
<v Speaker 4>Literally flying me out of the sky with the hook.</v>

6699
02:50:32.690 --> 02:50:33.710
<v Speaker 4>I started the guy next to me.</v>

6700
02:50:33.711 --> 02:50:34.544
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

6701
02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:35.481
<v Speaker 4>it looks like,</v>

6702
02:50:35.481 --> 02:50:36.314
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6703
02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:37.101
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

6704
02:50:37.101 --> 02:50:39.210
<v Speaker 4>what feed Orlowski man in the air.</v>

6705
02:50:39.230 --> 02:50:41.460
<v Speaker 4>One second down your face the next.</v>

6706
02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:43.880
<v Speaker 4>That's why the flying knee is so wacky.</v>

6707
02:50:44.390 --> 02:50:46.950
<v Speaker 4>You know Duke Roufus Gate perfect commentary on that too.</v>

6708
02:50:46.951 --> 02:50:47.510
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

6709
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.691
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

6710
02:50:47.691 --> 02:50:48.890
<v Speaker 4>you feel like you're a mortal.</v>

6711
02:50:48.891 --> 02:50:50.420
<v Speaker 4>You just kind of flying neither guy,</v>

6712
02:50:50.421 --> 02:50:51.560
<v Speaker 4>but you don't realize you're just,</v>

6713
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.903
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking,</v>

6714
02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:55.430
<v Speaker 4>your face is flying towards his fist to,</v>

6715
02:50:57.180 --> 02:50:59.010
<v Speaker 4>so Jeremy's been landed some good clean,</v>

6716
02:50:59.011 --> 02:50:59.844
<v Speaker 4>right hands.</v>

6717
02:51:00.930 --> 02:51:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I like his leg kick.</v>

6718
02:51:01.811 --> 02:51:02.640
<v Speaker 4>Started riding with them.</v>

6719
02:51:02.640 --> 02:51:04.620
<v Speaker 4>Hard kicks and hard punches too.</v>

6720
02:51:04.621 --> 02:51:05.850
<v Speaker 4>And you could see cub is,</v>

6721
02:51:06.180 --> 02:51:08.440
<v Speaker 4>he's well aware that Jeremy's throat.</v>

6722
02:51:08.470 --> 02:51:09.303
<v Speaker 4>UHHH,</v>

6723
02:51:09.420 --> 02:51:10.253
<v Speaker 4>fucking slick.</v>

6724
02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Cartwheels.</v>

6725
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:14.490
<v Speaker 4>One Hand because I'm a gangster.</v>

6726
02:51:14.520 --> 02:51:17.820
<v Speaker 4>He's tries to rolling thunder shit with the round kick.</v>

6727
02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:18.721
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to lie.</v>

6728
02:51:18.721 --> 02:51:19.560
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to lay the,</v>

6729
02:51:19.561 --> 02:51:21.380
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of fun and never landed.</v>

6730
02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:22.860
<v Speaker 4>I just throw it in people's directions.</v>

6731
02:51:22.861 --> 02:51:23.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

6732
02:51:23.330 --> 02:51:23.580
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

6733
02:51:23.580 --> 02:51:24.930
<v Speaker 4>This has been trying that allowed to,</v>

6734
02:51:24.931 --> 02:51:25.950
<v Speaker 4>according to Duke,</v>

6735
02:51:28.990 --> 02:51:31.600
<v Speaker 4>I don't even think I've ever been brushed anyone's hands that just fucking</v>

6736
02:51:31.601 --> 02:51:32.434
<v Speaker 4>throat and they're like,</v>

6737
02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:34.870
<v Speaker 4>will you ever see Brian ever saw throw that cart wheel kick?</v>

6738
02:51:34.871 --> 02:51:36.340
<v Speaker 4>He loves that rolling thunder kick.</v>

6739
02:51:36.350 --> 02:51:37.780
<v Speaker 4>He does it really well too.</v>

6740
02:51:37.930 --> 02:51:39.410
<v Speaker 4>And he did it in a fight once ever.</v>

6741
02:51:39.411 --> 02:51:41.800
<v Speaker 4>Salt did and they thought it was a fix.</v>

6742
02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:45.220
<v Speaker 4>They were going to find him and they were talking and they thought it was a fake</v>

6743
02:51:45.221 --> 02:51:47.980
<v Speaker 4>fight because they thought that that technique wasn't real.</v>

6744
02:51:49.090 --> 02:51:51.850
<v Speaker 4>That's how dumb some of these fucking people that are buying these athletic</v>

6745
02:51:51.851 --> 02:51:52.650
<v Speaker 4>commissions are.</v>

6746
02:51:52.650 --> 02:51:55.240
<v Speaker 4>It's essentially like a spinning ax kick.</v>

6747
02:51:55.320 --> 02:51:55.630
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6748
02:51:55.630 --> 02:51:56.650
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's what it's like.</v>

6749
02:51:56.990 --> 02:51:57.641
<v Speaker 4>There was a guy,</v>

6750
02:51:57.641 --> 02:51:58.441
<v Speaker 4>a motor guy,</v>

6751
02:51:58.441 --> 02:52:02.500
<v Speaker 4>Sanchez sore kink store who's credible and he'll do that one handed.</v>

6752
02:52:02.770 --> 02:52:05.270
<v Speaker 4>I saw him hit a dude in Holland from</v>

6753
02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:06.910
<v Speaker 2>knocking right back there.</v>

6754
02:52:06.920 --> 02:52:10.250
<v Speaker 2>We just caught cub glip to nice right hand Sanchez,</v>

6755
02:52:10.251 --> 02:52:10.920
<v Speaker 2>it fucking,</v>

6756
02:52:10.920 --> 02:52:14.320
<v Speaker 2>and he's obese and he's not built like your average ties short and stocky and</v>

6757
02:52:14.321 --> 02:52:16.960
<v Speaker 2>just tosses crazy fast push kicks.</v>

6758
02:52:16.961 --> 02:52:19.540
<v Speaker 2>So good to watch those high level ties go out at two.</v>

6759
02:52:19.541 --> 02:52:24.010
<v Speaker 2>When you see like just the fluidity of the kicking technique and the speed of</v>

6760
02:52:24.011 --> 02:52:27.460
<v Speaker 2>the motions and you just see that next level striking.</v>

6761
02:52:27.850 --> 02:52:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6762
02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:29.200
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking frightening.</v>

6763
02:52:31.050 --> 02:52:32.520
<v Speaker 2>What I like is Jeremy's throwing hard.</v>

6764
02:52:32.521 --> 02:52:33.001
<v Speaker 2>You can tell,</v>

6765
02:52:33.001 --> 02:52:34.110
<v Speaker 2>but he's still on balance.</v>

6766
02:52:34.111 --> 02:52:35.550
<v Speaker 2>He's not losing his foot work over it.</v>

6767
02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:36.690
<v Speaker 2>Good kickback cub there.</v>

6768
02:52:36.780 --> 02:52:37.613
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

6769
02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:42.090
<v Speaker 4>This is a high level fight man.</v>

6770
02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:46.140
<v Speaker 4>And the winner of this fight easily could be the next guy in line at one 45.</v>

6771
02:52:47.340 --> 02:52:47.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

6772
02:52:47.950 --> 02:52:48.910
<v Speaker 4>You know Jane,</v>

6773
02:52:49.420 --> 02:52:49.731
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

6774
02:52:49.731 --> 02:52:50.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm not saying it,</v>

6775
02:52:50.801 --> 02:52:52.870
<v Speaker 4>but they said to um,</v>

6776
02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:56.470
<v Speaker 4>to Jeremy that if he won he could be a short of a child shot or something like</v>

6777
02:52:56.471 --> 02:52:57.131
<v Speaker 4>that in some interview.</v>

6778
02:52:57.131 --> 02:52:59.920
<v Speaker 4>But honestly it doesn't mean anything.</v>

6779
02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:01.150
<v Speaker 4>It only,</v>

6780
02:53:01.150 --> 02:53:03.580
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's nice for the good right hand by cub.</v>

6781
02:53:03.640 --> 02:53:04.150
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>

6782
02:53:04.150 --> 02:53:04.630
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

6783
02:53:04.630 --> 02:53:05.463
<v Speaker 4>caught the kick.</v>

6784
02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:10.960
<v Speaker 4>Let's see what cub does off his back.</v>

6785
02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:13.480
<v Speaker 4>It goes right to butterfly cops.</v>

6786
02:53:13.490 --> 02:53:14.560
<v Speaker 4>Got a fucking black belt man.</v>

6787
02:53:15.220 --> 02:53:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

6788
02:53:15.970 --> 02:53:19.210
<v Speaker 4>he used to coach my nephew out in palm springs,</v>

6789
02:53:19.430 --> 02:53:20.260
<v Speaker 4>a teen.</v>

6790
02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:21.220
<v Speaker 4>He's holding on to that neck,</v>

6791
02:53:21.221 --> 02:53:22.054
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

6792
02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:24.280
<v Speaker 4>Jeremy's got to be careful if he scoots his butt out,</v>

6793
02:53:24.790 --> 02:53:26.740
<v Speaker 4>scoots his out and gets a good grip on that neck.</v>

6794
02:53:26.770 --> 02:53:28.480
<v Speaker 4>He's passing his right arm through.</v>

6795
02:53:28.481 --> 02:53:29.350
<v Speaker 4>What's he doing on his right arm?</v>

6796
02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Is it a position where you can sweep or go over the head for the neck?</v>

6797
02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:35.850
<v Speaker 2>This is going to watch both and he keeps</v>

6798
02:53:36.130 --> 02:53:36.841
<v Speaker 4>his hips back.</v>

6799
02:53:36.841 --> 02:53:37.051
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>

6800
02:53:37.051 --> 02:53:37.884
<v Speaker 4>I like to wear,</v>

02:53:38.070 --> 02:53:38.903

6812

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

6813
02:53:50.390 --> 02:53:52.340

6814
02:53:53.590 --> 02:53:53.930
