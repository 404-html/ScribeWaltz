20
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.020

<v Speaker 1>You had some gags and he did them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew.</v>

55
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you didn't do your gags first,</v>

56
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>you know the guy in front of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did them,</v>

57
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.600
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

58
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.140
<v Speaker 3>You know what's funny is that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys from that era,</v>

59
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.260
<v Speaker 3>like everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob Newhart's famous for the phone bank.</v>

60
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bob Newhart's,</v>

61
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.480
<v Speaker 3>famous for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like on the phone and he'll do one </v>

62
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.971
<v Speaker 3>sided,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one side of the phone conversation </v>

63
00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 3>to Larry's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But there's a lot of guys from that era </v>

64
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.350
<v Speaker 3>who did the same exact phone bit.</v>

65
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.730
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

66
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:51.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.310
<v Speaker 1>while he was yelling at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a part of me that wanted to </v>

68
00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.310
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up.</v>

69
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You will cock sucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't want.</v>

70
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.630
<v Speaker 1>He died two weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means he was real close to death </v>

71
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 1>that night could have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I yelled at him,</v>

72
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.300
<v Speaker 1>he might've killed over and fucking died</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>

73
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:14.790
<v Speaker 1>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a 10 percent,</v>

74
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was like,</v>

75
00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.270
<v Speaker 1>why am I listening to this old Douche </v>
<v Speaker 1>bag?</v>

76
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:23.271
<v Speaker 1>Because my philosophy on old people has </v>
<v Speaker 1>always been that old ass holes were </v>

77
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:24.720
<v Speaker 1>assholes and they're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just survived.</v>

78
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just became an asshole when he </v>

79
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.140
<v Speaker 1>turned 80.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy's a Douche bag and I,</v>

80
00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thought about yelling at him,</v>

81
00:04:31.561 --> 00:04:32.340
<v Speaker 1>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

82
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.070
<v Speaker 1>that's not gonna help anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

83
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:36.680
<v Speaker 1>what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is on television,</v>

84
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.280
<v Speaker 1>so everyone's going to see this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>material.</v>

85
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.440
<v Speaker 1>They're going to see what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's going to know what happened.</v>

86
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.470
<v Speaker 1>So I did not think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we are with a John Safran neural</v>

87
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:52.361
<v Speaker 1>linguistic programming freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Heffron is recalibrating his mind.</v>

88
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.490
<v Speaker 1>He said some very negative negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that he was following earlier </v>

89
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.790
<v Speaker 1>on in his life and he's abandoned all </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

90
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>No more drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more bad stuff.</v>

91
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.810
<v Speaker 1>John Heffron is all about positive </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and and,</v>

92
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.370
<v Speaker 1>and Tony Robbins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of.</v>

94
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Tony Robbins without the.</v>

95
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:17.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm walking on on fire and going to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>seminar with $20,000.</v>

96
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 3>Really motivated people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.300
<v Speaker 3>What is the walking on fire?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

98
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:24.270
<v Speaker 3>it probably helps you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It teaches you to walk on fire.</v>

99
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 3>How you would then apply that skill to </v>
<v Speaker 3>other things in your life.</v>

100
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:28.760
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

101
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.720
<v Speaker 3>because even if you having an argument </v>
<v Speaker 3>with your girl,</v>

102
00:05:30.721 --> 00:05:32.730
<v Speaker 3>you can't go a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can walk on fire.</v>

103
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't apply to anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but walking on fire guys fighting that </v>

104
00:05:37.831 --> 00:05:42.831
<v Speaker 3>bus boards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great if a guy jumps in front of </v>

105
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 3>you with six boards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:43.321 --> 00:05:44.880
<v Speaker 3>What's the fucking point in breaking </v>
<v Speaker 3>boards?</v>

107
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't get that.</v>

108
00:05:45.961 --> 00:05:47.640
<v Speaker 3>Or the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the break in the.</v>

109
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 3>I guess it's your power and a punch but </v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

110
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is.</v>

111
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:52.590
<v Speaker 3>If a guy is standing there,</v>

112
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.600
<v Speaker 1>boards break pretty easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the sad thing.</v>

113
00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Those boards are used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations.</v>

114
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>They all break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid type window,</v>

115
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>whenever we used to open up a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>

116
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>we would all have to go and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations.</v>

117
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>And what part of the demonstration was </v>
<v Speaker 1>he out of kick boards,</v>

118
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>break boards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just always seemed so silly.</v>

119
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:12.300
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

120
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.470
<v Speaker 3>what was I going to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about nero linguistic </v>

121
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.470
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

122
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 3>Buddy Hackett.</v>

123
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're doing all this programming and</v>

124
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 1>this programming leads to you better </v>
<v Speaker 1>performances on stage?</v>

125
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's basically that it just kind of.</v>

126
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.000
<v Speaker 3>We rewires your brain to every.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody.</v>

127
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.330
<v Speaker 3>If something happened to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you probably racked similar in every </v>

128
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.201
<v Speaker 3>single situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this Kinda just trains your brain to </v>

129
00:06:40.201 --> 00:06:43.711
<v Speaker 3>maybe take a the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you options to handle those </v>

130
00:06:43.711 --> 00:06:46.030
<v Speaker 3>situations where you have zero options,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're just going to freak out.</v>

131
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.360
<v Speaker 3>And if you have a few,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're usually take the best option for </v>

132
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.360
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

133
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but it also keeps you from doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty things,</v>

134
00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:54.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps you from rolling your life.</v>

135
00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>

136
00:06:55.971 --> 00:07:00.971
<v Speaker 3>it's troubling for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What I did is you kind of work </v>

137
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:03.611
<v Speaker 3>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You figure out what you want to </v>

138
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:05.321
<v Speaker 3>accomplish and then you kind of get all </v>
<v Speaker 3>those feelings and what it feels like </v>

139
00:07:05.321 --> 00:07:09.701
<v Speaker 3>once you accomplish those and it kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>let your brain know this is the way I </v>

140
00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 3>want to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is make every decision.</v>

141
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm in the right way to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to obtain that goal.</v>

142
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think for me it's,</v>

143
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people go,</v>

144
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:18.060
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's all,</v>

145
00:07:18.061 --> 00:07:23.061
<v Speaker 3>it's all common sense stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a big difference between a </v>

146
00:07:23.061 --> 00:07:24.090
<v Speaker 3>common sense and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

147
00:07:24.091 --> 00:07:26.550
<v Speaker 3>it's common knowledge or actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>applying it,</v>

148
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>but you apply it now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're all about doing that.</v>

149
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do.</v>

150
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 3>Before I get on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do some techniques to get me because </v>

151
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as stand ups you can get,</v>

152
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.320
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people don't realize it's not what you </v>

153
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.821
<v Speaker 3>travel with guys day your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of times I'm working with </v>

154
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 3>dudes that bugged me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cereal,</v>

155
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.610
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or whatever.</v>

156
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:52.611
<v Speaker 3>So you get in a bad mood for 8 billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>different reasons before you get on </v>

157
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:54.570
<v Speaker 3>stage and then you enter that stage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of in a pissy mood,</v>

158
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.370
<v Speaker 3>which then that comes across to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd.</v>

159
00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.370
<v Speaker 3>Or what I would do is I would say a </v>
<v Speaker 3>group of guys let's say,</v>

160
00:07:59.371 --> 00:08:01.300
<v Speaker 3>and in my head I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

161
00:08:01.301 --> 00:08:06.301
<v Speaker 3>those guys are going to heckle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I start playing this movie in </v>

162
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:06.301
<v Speaker 3>my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

163
00:08:06.301 --> 00:08:06.510
<v Speaker 3>they're going to heckle right up my </v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite joke.</v>

164
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to wrap that thing.</v>

165
00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.370
<v Speaker 3>And I start to go like literally play it</v>
<v Speaker 3>out as if it happened.</v>

166
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.370
<v Speaker 3>So then when I got on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was already mad at these guys that </v>

167
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.111
<v Speaker 3>didn't say anything so I can take the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stage or the little bit more </v>

168
00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:23.810
<v Speaker 3>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then that puts a weird vibe on the </v>

169
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:25.740
<v Speaker 3>crowd even though those guys might have </v>
<v Speaker 3>not said anything the entire show.</v>

170
00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.110
<v Speaker 3>But now I do that with every part of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

171
00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:29.610
<v Speaker 3>And I think a lot of people do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

172
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:30.060
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

173
00:08:30.061 --> 00:08:31.570
<v Speaker 3>look at that girl over there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd asked her,</v>

174
00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 3>I asked you probably gonna say no </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

175
00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 3>She probably getting to st o will make </v>
<v Speaker 3>me feel stupid in front of all my other </v>

176
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 3>friends and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

177
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

178
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.340
<v Speaker 1>Just the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lag.</v>

179
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 1>There is a definitely a lag because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching us on the video and it's </v>

180
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.650
<v Speaker 1>totally different from what we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

181
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.410
<v Speaker 1>It's like John's still talking on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

182
00:08:50.411 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 1>but right now I'm going to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

183
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Really was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that because you streamed gay as </v>

184
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 1>fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just</v>

185
00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 4>we're live streaming video,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

186
00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.850
<v Speaker 4>because it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would it be better if we were on </v>

187
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:03.850
<v Speaker 4>blog.tv,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

188
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really matter about Justin </v>

189
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 4>Dot TV.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would that be better?</v>

190
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.810
<v Speaker 4>Who cares if people are watching this </v>
<v Speaker 4>care man?</v>

191
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 4>God's saying lag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's upset.</v>

192
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did,</v>

193
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:19.580
<v Speaker 4>how did they know there's a lag?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he's watching the video and the </v>

194
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:19.580
<v Speaker 4>sound is different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

195
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The sound and video is the same,</v>

196
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.800
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

197
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.790
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifteen years,</v>

198
00:09:23.791 --> 00:09:25.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>15 seconds delay.</v>

199
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the hell do you know there's alive </v>

200
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:30.730
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>

201
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:30.730
<v Speaker 3>Probably on a slow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shitty,</v>

202
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:34.540
<v Speaker 3>shitty ass in that connection.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why are you blaming us and aol dial up </v>

203
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 3>John from.</v>

204
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Not only is he a standup comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also hosted the MMA awards this year,</v>

205
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>which was a total fucking disaster.</v>

206
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.700
<v Speaker 3>Really complete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say it was a total.</v>

207
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:49.470
<v Speaker 3>The edited version.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim,</v>

208
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:51.440
<v Speaker 3>on awesome way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You told it to me.</v>

209
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it was the check cleared.</v>

210
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:56.190
<v Speaker 3>The check is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's talk.</v>

211
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the check is coming there,</v>

212
00:09:57.641 --> 00:10:02.641
<v Speaker 3>but for me it was weird that the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>who got to see it on versus got to see </v>

213
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 3>it live as if it was happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there was a lot of,</v>

214
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.850
<v Speaker 3>shoot this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy sucks.</v>

215
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those youth described to me talking </v>

216
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:14.540
<v Speaker 3>about me hosting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

217
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:20.320
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get to those sitting at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the safety of their computer and </v>

218
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:24.010
<v Speaker 3>being maybe 15 or 16 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would probably think that it's stuff</v>

219
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.380
<v Speaker 3>not realizing that hosting something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

220

222
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:34.440
<v Speaker 1>video should sync up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going on.</v>

223
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Some dude said that the MMA awards were </v>

00:11:12.611 --> 00:11:13.430
<v Speaker 3>people know honestly because they had $0</v>

236
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.270
<v Speaker 1>plus also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hosting thing.</v>

237
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:17.780
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't have hosted it because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentator</v>

238
00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.040
<v Speaker 3>anyone and make some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a human,</v>

240
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:28.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan and I'm as objective as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible when it comes to other </v>

241
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.530
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm always talking about fate or,</v>

242
00:11:30.531 --> 00:11:33.680
<v Speaker 1>and I'm always talking about Iot and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different guys who fight.</v>

243
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Alistair overeem and different guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting other organizations.</v>

244
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:39.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in,</v>

245
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at all.</v>

246
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:43.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a fan,</v>

247
00:11:43.131 --> 00:11:44.990
<v Speaker 1>you have to like all the different </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

248
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:49.991
<v Speaker 1>You can't just be loyal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the UFC is the greatest job </v>

249
00:11:49.991 --> 00:11:52.571
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had and it's a fucking awesome</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gig and I appreciate the hell out of it </v>

250
00:11:52.571 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>and I loved the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as a fan,</v>

251
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:58.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't just only follow the fighters </v>

252
00:11:58.951 --> 00:11:58.951
<v Speaker 1>and the fights that are in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>

253
00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 1>That's just silly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love my favorite thing.</v>

254
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I tweeted this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was watching you do a commentating,</v>

255
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 1>one of the fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love when you call out an entire group</v>

256
00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 1>of 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people for billing because I can,</v>

257
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.740
<v Speaker 1>I get mad like we'll just drunk.</v>

258
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.990
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is I understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't like the decision.</v>

259
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.750
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once the dude is talking,</v>

260
00:12:18.751 --> 00:12:20.640
<v Speaker 1>when they're interviewing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dude booing him,</v>

261
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.820
<v Speaker 1>all he did was like Erin Simpson versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Laurel.</v>

262
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:26.370
<v Speaker 1>What was the last one like you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>boot.</v>

263
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Erin Simpson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy thought his ass off.</v>

264
00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:32.910
<v Speaker 1>He got hurt really bad the first round </v>
<v Speaker 1>and came back and won the second and the</v>

265
00:12:32.911 --> 00:12:36.630
<v Speaker 1>third and it was a really gutsy </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance man.</v>

266
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>And he had mandarins and even in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third round he outpaced Tom Lawler and </v>

267
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.310
<v Speaker 1>it was just a great fight overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great fight.</v>

268
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how anybody couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have enjoyed it.</v>

269
00:12:46.471 --> 00:12:49.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in situations like that,</v>

270
00:12:49.291 --> 00:12:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I hate clothes decisions because close </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions like that man,</v>

271
00:12:53.521 --> 00:12:58.350
<v Speaker 1>it could have gone either way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the fight really took place.</v>

272
00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Everybody saw what happened and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide that one guy won it or another </v>

273
00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:06.150
<v Speaker 1>guy wanted when it's that close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would much rather have a draw.</v>

274
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that fight could have easily </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a draw.</v>

275
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:14.150
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people thought that Tom Lawler </v>

276
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.951
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I definitely think he won the </v>

277
00:13:15.951 --> 00:13:15.951
<v Speaker 1>first round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think Erin Simpson when the second</v>

278
00:13:15.951 --> 00:13:20.400
<v Speaker 1>and third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although not in as large a margin second</v>

279
00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:22.950
<v Speaker 1>very slight and the third a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

280
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.140
<v Speaker 1>I think if you looked at it on paper you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could say,</v>

281
00:13:25.141 --> 00:13:27.210
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you could give the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>round ten eight,</v>

282
00:13:27.211 --> 00:13:30.780
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is forget about all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

283
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.590
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is it was a great fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>and guys should feel like a loser.</v>

284
00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no way Tom Walsh will feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a loser after that fight and </v>

285
00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:39.740
<v Speaker 1>there's no way Erin Simpson should have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done booed.</v>

286
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I anytime I've been at live fight or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear the people,</v>

287
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't get mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I love when people start going start</v>

288
00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:52.961
<v Speaker 1>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand him up when they've been on the </v>

289
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:52.961
<v Speaker 1>ground for maybe 35 seconds.</v>

290
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still one more if guys or guys feel</v>

291
00:13:55.221 --> 00:13:57.710
<v Speaker 1>out each other like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay with an expired.</v>

292
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean I spar MMA is my golf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't smarter really trying to tell </v>

293
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:03.950
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy the workout of it.</v>

294
00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.530
<v Speaker 1>But even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

295
00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to fill out a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't just go,</v>

296
00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:09.860
<v Speaker 1>go and then start start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

297
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 1>people expect like hockey fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes where it just erupts </v>

298
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:14.950
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk out,</v>

299
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.610
<v Speaker 1>they go toe to toe and started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

300
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just that the one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>action is great.</v>

301
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.890
<v Speaker 1>It's so exciting that people want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that part going and then when it </v>

302
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.550
<v Speaker 1>goes to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the uneducated fans,</v>

303
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.220
<v Speaker 1>if they don't know what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get upset,</v>

304
00:14:28.221 --> 00:14:32.240
<v Speaker 1>but promise the referees in small towns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when we go to Memphis,</v>

305
00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't say small towns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memphis is in a small town,</v>

306
00:14:34.311 --> 00:14:35.720
<v Speaker 1>but we you go outside of Vegas.</v>

307
00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:38.840
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times they use local referees </v>
<v Speaker 1>and these guys,</v>

308
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.870
<v Speaker 1>they're too busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get involved.</v>

309
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:42.170
<v Speaker 1>They actually too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.740
<v Speaker 1>fight guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight mma,</v>

311
00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

312
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.790
<v Speaker 1>you know guys in the guard is working as</v>
<v Speaker 1>guard is trying for an arm bar.</v>

313
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:52.791
<v Speaker 1>I was trying for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stand you up and we're </v>

314
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:52.791
<v Speaker 1>standing out like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about.</v>

315
00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:52.960
<v Speaker 1>You understand what these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>

316
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:58.710
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think most people realize the </v>

317
00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:00.881
<v Speaker 1>difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just have somebody your size if </v>

318
00:15:00.881 --> 00:15:03.851
<v Speaker 1>not a little bit bigger laying on top of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and then stand up from that </v>

319
00:15:03.851 --> 00:15:05.360
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just letting that person just with their</v>

320
00:15:05.361 --> 00:15:07.850
<v Speaker 1>weight and how hard it is just to stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

321
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.200
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if I'm on,</v>

322
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 1>if I'm on my back and you're on top of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me and I and I scrambled and I get it,</v>

323
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:15.620
<v Speaker 1>that we both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we stand up together.</v>

324
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge feat in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

325
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might,</v>

326
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 1>it maybe not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shouldn't be that way.</v>

327
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You should get up is if you got up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be the referee stands.</v>

328
00:15:25.371 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate all that shit,</v>

329
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.840
<v Speaker 1>but I've always said that if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone like Brock Lesnar can take </v>

330
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:31.840
<v Speaker 1>you down and molest you for five </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

331
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.830
<v Speaker 1>then that's tough shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough Shit.</v>

332
00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:38.831
<v Speaker 1>He's got you on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to find a way that a way to get </v>

333
00:15:38.831 --> 00:15:40.220
<v Speaker 1>back up to feet and if you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's five minutes of him punching you in</v>

334
00:15:40.221 --> 00:15:45.221
<v Speaker 1>the face and that's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if your technique to avoid that is </v>

335
00:15:45.221 --> 00:15:46.160
<v Speaker 1>to turn and run in circles so we can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>tackle you,</v>

336
00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 1>then do is whenever it gets here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

337
00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.770
<v Speaker 1>that's going to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to decide your career is </v>

338
00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.120
<v Speaker 1>going to be fans and with their fans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your style,</v>

339
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.510
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you sell tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you know,</v>

340
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.570
<v Speaker 1>you optimize your potential as a mixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>martial artist and the fans are going to</v>

341
00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:10.571
<v Speaker 1>let you know whether or not they like </v>
<v Speaker 1>your style and if you've got a boring </v>

342
00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:10.571
<v Speaker 1>ass style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you like winning fights,</v>

343
00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:11.240
<v Speaker 1>nobody's gonna give a shit.</v>

344
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.770
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to buy your paper </v>
<v Speaker 1>views.</v>

345
00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like that's commerce,</v>

346
00:16:15.501 --> 00:16:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how it's supposed to work.</v>

347
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be let,</v>

348
00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.370
<v Speaker 1>let the market dictate what the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

349
00:16:22.371 --> 00:16:23.460
<v Speaker 1>People are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not I,</v>

350
00:16:23.461 --> 00:16:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said you sent a clip the other day,</v>

351
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 1>a tag team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think the evolution,</v>

352
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:31.880
<v Speaker 1>if you were just to pretend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>

353
00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.170
<v Speaker 1>you think maybe 40 years it'd be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe numb chuck's on Iraq,</v>

354
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 1>like on a hook on the side of the cage </v>
<v Speaker 1>where then.</v>

355
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's not as fun.</v>

356
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:43.970
<v Speaker 1>The Fun thing is man to man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No weapons.</v>

357
00:16:43.971 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could go the Roman gladiator style,</v>

358
00:16:46.641 --> 00:16:50.000
<v Speaker 1>have dudes have sword fights and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be certainly be fucking crazy,</v>

359
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately I don't think it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>as enjoyable.</v>

360
00:16:52.621 --> 00:16:57.621
<v Speaker 1>It just be more fucked up because your </v>
<v Speaker 1>champion Musashi,</v>

361
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Musashi beat 62 men and a sword fights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unless you're Musashi,</v>

362
00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:06.860
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get fucking sliced up.</v>

363
00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:12.020
<v Speaker 4>You sucks about that tag team idea is </v>
<v Speaker 4>half the people probably think that's a </v>

364
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 4>great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know they all came from wrestling.</v>

365
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:17.270
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't go to the.</v>

366
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.920
<v Speaker 4>Go to the youtube clip that I posted up </v>
<v Speaker 4>on tag team member,</v>

367
00:17:19.921 --> 00:17:21.440
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every fucking.</v>

368
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.440
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is this shit now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why was that?</v>

369
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.240
<v Speaker 4>What happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then?</v>

370
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:31.241
<v Speaker 4>What happened from the transition of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling thinking that's an awesome </v>

371
00:17:31.241 --> 00:17:31.340
<v Speaker 4>idea to all those fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wrestling's fake.</v>

372
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the real.</v>

373
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.390
<v Speaker 1>The evolution is war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like football.</v>

374
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like a team of MMA guys on one side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the field that it's know</v>

375
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.080
<v Speaker 4>I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a hulk Hogan story for you.</v>

376
00:17:45.081 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we're at the UFC,</v>

377
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:51.791
<v Speaker 4>he sat right in front of me and he has </v>
<v Speaker 4>this really weird hair where it looks </v>

378
00:17:51.791 --> 00:17:54.981
<v Speaker 4>like it's a wig almost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he pulled out a comb and during the </v>

379
00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:56.800
<v Speaker 4>UFC the whole time he's just calming the</v>
<v Speaker 4>back of his hair and like,</v>

380
00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.030
<v Speaker 4>like just like kind of go like this and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like flipping it over his shoulder and I</v>

381
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:05.031
<v Speaker 4>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this really the hall cogan that I </v>

382
00:18:05.031 --> 00:18:05.031
<v Speaker 4>know is combing his hair?</v>

383
00:18:05.031 --> 00:18:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he probably does it like for like,</v>

384
00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:10.380
<v Speaker 1>it's probably a show like part of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his image and it's just because,</v>

385
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's silly.</v>

386
00:18:12.131 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 1>He's always on when he's out in public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

387
00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:17.660
<v Speaker 1>he's the hipster dude interviewing him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the shift.</v>

388
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Was that fucking awesome man?</v>

389
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.960
<v Speaker 4>He was really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

390
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:22.630
<v Speaker 1>It's great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real Nice Guy.</v>

391
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Every interview you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

392
00:18:24.161 --> 00:18:26.770
<v Speaker 1>not every interview you've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw you interview.</v>

393
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.620
<v Speaker 1>There's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a fight in the stands right</v>

394
00:18:29.621 --> 00:18:31.360
<v Speaker 1>before you go to talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

395
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:36.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happened with a semester so long </v>

396
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you're interviewing rocky and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

397
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.720
<v Speaker 1>there was a thing that happened with </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

398
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 1>There's always like a little moment </v>
<v Speaker 1>right before it's funny I guess,</v>

399
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:49.010
<v Speaker 1>or to make them more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could have cage fighting or </v>

400
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 1>where you have to queue fighters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then random people standing around like </v>

401
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.921
<v Speaker 1>a bar fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then you'd have to worry about </v>

402
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:57.250
<v Speaker 1>throwing a punch back and have it going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be robots in a name in the future.</v>

403
00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.590
<v Speaker 1>No human chimp hybrids.</v>

404
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:07.830
<v Speaker 1>People are going to like infuse their </v>
<v Speaker 1>body with chimp DNA and jumped on top of</v>

405
00:19:08.291 --> 00:19:10.150
<v Speaker 1>the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be so much stronger and</v>

406
00:19:10.151 --> 00:19:11.190
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

407
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:16.430
<v Speaker 1>is this going to be some definitely just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be genetic engineering in the </v>

408
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.711
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when genetic engineering becomes a </v>

409
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:19.711
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget about steroids.</v>

410
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:24.091
<v Speaker 1>Steroids are going to be nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be nothing when they get </v>

411
00:19:24.091 --> 00:19:25.090
<v Speaker 1>gene diastat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

412
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.920
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen the video of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

413
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:32.100
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of kids that have been </v>

414
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:33.991
<v Speaker 1>born with myostatin problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens is they develop like a </v>

415
00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:37.540
<v Speaker 1>extreme amount of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all like there's whippets,</v>

416
00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a dog called a whippet and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>breed these dogs to try to make them </v>

417
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 1>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them sleek and run fast and </v>

418
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:49.750
<v Speaker 1>occasionally they have an error in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics and they get giant muscles.</v>

419
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.690
<v Speaker 1>It looked like they didn't only look </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like photoshop,</v>

420
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:57.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's a real dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like super roided up shredded and no fat</v>

421
00:19:57.521 --> 00:20:02.521
<v Speaker 1>and it's incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's all they've done it already </v>

422
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:05.461
<v Speaker 1>to mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've engineered mice so that these </v>

423
00:20:05.461 --> 00:20:08.461
<v Speaker 1>mice have this mile staten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a inhibitor situation going on and they </v>

424
00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.010
<v Speaker 1>have giant muscles and they can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They live longer.</v>

425
00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for a minute.</v>

426
00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I hope all that stuff comes around right</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the time when I'm in my sixties,</v>

427
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:20.410
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna Happen,</v>

428
00:20:20.411 --> 00:20:22.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to own it.</v>

429
00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

430
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Everything is going in a direction where</v>
<v Speaker 1>like science fiction,</v>

431
00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:32.790
<v Speaker 1>like the things that we thought of as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being completely ridiculous in the 19 </v>

432
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:36.331
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This stuff that you would see in a </v>

433
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:36.331
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's all real now.</v>

434
00:20:36.331 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you see that new Microsoft touch </v>

435
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.651
<v Speaker 1>thing where they have a table and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can put something on the table and it </v>

436
00:20:43.651 --> 00:20:45.490
<v Speaker 1>recognizes what that something is and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives you information on it.</v>

437
00:20:45.491 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like minority of type </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

438
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is all going to happen.</v>

439
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.680
<v Speaker 4>I was talking about that new cell phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea that Nokia has where it's a phone </v>

440
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.430
<v Speaker 4>that you're talking and then he flipped </v>
<v Speaker 4>on your wrist when you were doing,</v>

441
00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like turns into jewelry.</v>

442
00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it wraps around you.</v>

443
00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:02.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

444
00:21:02.191 --> 00:21:07.191
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the bracelets as the old metal </v>

445
00:21:07.191 --> 00:21:09.131
<v Speaker 4>bracelets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you still like flip on your wrist </v>

446
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:09.131
<v Speaker 4>and that girls would have um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

447
00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:13.101
<v Speaker 4>it's a cell phone at the bendable lcd </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they just happened at the other day </v>

448
00:21:13.101 --> 00:21:14.570
<v Speaker 4>and it's pretty much what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They can unsweetened and out,</v>

449
00:21:14.571 --> 00:21:16.070
<v Speaker 4>use it as a phone and then when they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>done,</v>

450
00:21:16.071 --> 00:21:17.300
<v Speaker 4>you just clip it on your wrist.</v>

451
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 3>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Neo Technology or the took sharkskin the</v>

452
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:26.680
<v Speaker 3>hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all bladed and made the suit that's</v>

453
00:21:26.681 --> 00:21:29.280
<v Speaker 3>almost unstoppable and stuff for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>soldiers were.</v>

454
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.340
<v Speaker 3>You were almost like a wetsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's an nothing can get through it.</v>

455
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:38.490
<v Speaker 3>So it's like Kevin Vocabulary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's thinner and stuff then it's </v>

456
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.911
<v Speaker 3>ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he could wear it as a full body and </v>

457
00:21:41.911 --> 00:21:41.911
<v Speaker 3>you can't stab someone with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

458
00:21:41.911 --> 00:21:44.860
<v Speaker 3>well regular Kevlar can be stabbed </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight on.</v>

459
00:21:44.861 --> 00:21:49.861
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a knife you can get through </v>

460
00:21:49.861 --> 00:21:51.151
<v Speaker 3>capital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is some sharkskin is what some </v>

461
00:21:51.151 --> 00:21:53.140
<v Speaker 3>guy invented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He invented it to stop shark attacks,</v>

462
00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.880
<v Speaker 3>but it's not that chain mail stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a wetsuit.</v>

463
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.050
<v Speaker 3>That can't be another messing with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

464
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.150
<v Speaker 3>One day I going to have a real iron man </v>
<v Speaker 3>suit.</v>

465
00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:06.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going gonna be crazy if they don't </v>

466
00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.260
<v Speaker 3>already know the guys who are gonna look</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Halo.</v>

467
00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:10.540
<v Speaker 3>The dudes from from Halo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Definitely</v>

468
00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:16.220
<v Speaker 4>all that technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like star wars where you're going to </v>

469
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:16.220
<v Speaker 4>have a helmet that you pull out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>

470
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:17.520
<v Speaker 4>because he can't breathe the air </v>
<v Speaker 4>outside.</v>

471
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be that.</v>

472
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:21.410
<v Speaker 1>But I think most of the war is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be fought.</v>

473
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Like what the CIA's doing a Pakistan </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

474
00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 1>they've got drones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These drones are flying over Pakistan,</v>

475
00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:32.431
<v Speaker 1>just launching missiles down on people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is that all things </v>

476
00:22:32.431 --> 00:22:36.331
<v Speaker 1>accelerate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No things stay exactly where they are </v>

477
00:22:36.331 --> 00:22:39.511
<v Speaker 1>and the only time they degress is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a gigantic national competitor </v>

478
00:22:39.511 --> 00:22:43.110
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe or somebody blows up a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nuclear weapons and we would go back </v>

479
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:48.271
<v Speaker 1>to being fucking cave men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the only way things are </v>

480
00:22:48.271 --> 00:22:49.780
<v Speaker 1>going to decelerate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way things are going right now,</v>

481
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.210
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna move and crazier and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazier direction.</v>

482
00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:53.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've asked them fast.</v>

483
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:58.650
<v Speaker 1>We went from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from bows and arrows to guns to cannons </v>

484
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.450
<v Speaker 1>to and it keeps going and going and </v>
<v Speaker 1>going and now it's fucking drones.</v>

485
00:23:01.451 --> 00:23:03.130
<v Speaker 1>They're firing missiles from the sky.</v>

486
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

487
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Star Wars program they were trying </v>

488
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:09.480
<v Speaker 1>to do during the Reagan administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:14.161
<v Speaker 1>they were trying to have it so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have satellites that can shoot down </v>

490
00:23:14.161 --> 00:23:17.401
<v Speaker 1>missiles from space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But apparently that was all bullshit </v>

491
00:23:17.401 --> 00:23:17.970
<v Speaker 1>apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That never really worked in a PR.</v>

492
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:23.010
<v Speaker 1>There's a gigantic conspiracy wrapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the scientists that were involved</v>

493
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:27.790
<v Speaker 1>in the star wars program because </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently a fuck load of them have died</v>

494
00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:31.120
<v Speaker 1>under suspicious cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

495
00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:33.310
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you google it,</v>

496
00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:38.760
<v Speaker 1>anybody wants to Google it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could google it right now and I'll </v>

497
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:39.790
<v Speaker 1>put up a link for you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know if this is a legit,</v>

498
00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:45.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I don't know if it's a legit </v>

499
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.151
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the star scientists understanding </v>

500
00:23:48.151 --> 00:23:50.660
<v Speaker 1>what I need to conspiracy theory stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you talked about.</v>

501
00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:51.890
<v Speaker 1>Is there one site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

502
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:56.450
<v Speaker 1>let's say you're a new guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones' infowars.com.</v>

503
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.390
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warner's Geo Marconi,</v>

504
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:01.190
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>death conspiracy theorists.</v>

505
00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Mystery of the dead scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy with the PD has a little page</v>

506
00:24:06.921 --> 00:24:11.921
<v Speaker 1>on between 1982 and 1990 25 British </v>
<v Speaker 1>based GDC Marconi,</v>

507
00:24:12.711 --> 00:24:14.840
<v Speaker 1>scientists and engineers who work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

508
00:24:14.841 --> 00:24:16.040
<v Speaker 1>that's the sting ray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

509
00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:17.610
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars defense initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

510
00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>died under mysterious circumstances.</v>

511
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Police investigations found his death to</v>

512
00:24:24.801 --> 00:24:29.801
<v Speaker 1>be unconnected to the same police that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are out Taser and grandmas and shit is.</v>

513
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:35.710
<v Speaker 1>That was that he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was probably the snacks out of the </v>

514
00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:37.760
<v Speaker 1>vending machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably how aids was created.</v>

515
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.020
<v Speaker 1>There's so many sites on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to link it because I,</v>

516
00:24:41.021 --> 00:24:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

517
00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:46.931
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll link the Google search so you do </v>

518
00:24:46.931 --> 00:24:49.721
<v Speaker 1>your own work because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows how many of these </v>

519
00:24:49.721 --> 00:24:50.210
<v Speaker 1>guys are completely crazy.</v>

520
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 1>So I just sent it out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

521
00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Who knows how many guys are completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the fucking mind and who knows </v>

522
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:01.820
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

523
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars was ringing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

524
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the Reagan administration was </v>

525
00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:11.921
<v Speaker 1>famous for um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of secret shit was going on.</v>

526
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:17.280
<v Speaker 1>It says rag and introducing Star Wars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His announcement of what it was back in </v>

527
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.820
<v Speaker 1>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you showing it?</v>

528
00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:21.800
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to show a video or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something?</v>

529
00:25:21.801 --> 00:25:23.150
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a fuck.</v>

530
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't put that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Wars.</v>

531
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.550
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not weakened?</v>

532
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:33.940
<v Speaker 1>So people have them introducing star </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars because I don't want to put a,</v>

533
00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:38.510
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just a program where they shot,</v>

534
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.800
<v Speaker 1>supposedly had satellites that can shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>down missiles from space.</v>

535
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.410
<v Speaker 1>But apparently it was never functional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

536
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:50.411
<v Speaker 1>never proven to be effective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spent billions and billions of </v>

537
00:25:50.411 --> 00:25:51.590
<v Speaker 1>dollars on it and all these scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>

538
00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.270
<v Speaker 1>The big theory was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

539
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.060
<v Speaker 1>these guys knew too much and they knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was horseshit and so they had to</v>

540
00:25:56.061 --> 00:26:00.410
<v Speaker 1>kill them off before they talked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't put it past them,</v>

541
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get the CIA involved and if you ever</v>

542
00:26:03.531 --> 00:26:04.710
<v Speaker 1>read like economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

543
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:09.760
<v Speaker 1>confessions of an economic hitman and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you find out the shit that our </v>

544
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.080
<v Speaker 1>government does to other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they'd kill scientists,</v>

545
00:26:12.081 --> 00:26:14.090
<v Speaker 1>they'll kill anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck,</v>

546
00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same people that wanted us to go to </v>

547
00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 1>war in Iraq and were willing to lie </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a weapons of mass destruction.</v>

548
00:26:20.331 --> 00:26:25.331
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's a going on and on about </v>

549
00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:25.331
<v Speaker 1>September 11th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

550
00:26:25.331 --> 00:26:28.780
<v Speaker 1>do you really think the government would</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow innocent people to die during </v>

551
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:30.890
<v Speaker 1>September 11 so they could go to war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

552
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:34.010
<v Speaker 1>but do you really think they believed </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was weapons of mass destruction?</v>

553
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think that we're over in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq and Afghanistan for good reasons </v>

554
00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.660
<v Speaker 1>that benefit you and I know and millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people have died because of that,</v>

555
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.210
<v Speaker 1>at least a million civilians have died </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>

556
00:26:45.211 --> 00:26:50.211
<v Speaker 1>and so if they're willing to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think they're willing to kill </v>

557
00:26:50.211 --> 00:26:51.000
<v Speaker 1>a few thousand here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they are.</v>

558
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.330
<v Speaker 1>And forget about the few thousand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>died during nine slash 11.</v>

559
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.810
<v Speaker 1>The million people that died in Iraq or </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings,</v>

560
00:26:57.811 --> 00:27:00.900
<v Speaker 1>they're just as legitimate as the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that died in the twin towers.</v>

561
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all completely ridiculous.</v>

562
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we change the topic to something </v>

563
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:09.620
<v Speaker 1>fun?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love be praised as his name.</v>

564
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Somebody say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please look up.</v>

565
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 3>That's the definition of literally you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might engage it.</v>

566
00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Use that word too much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't know what it means.</v>

567
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what I know what's,</v>

568
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.880
<v Speaker 1>what's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The literal translation?</v>

569
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I know it literally,</v>

570
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

574
00:27:35.481 --> 00:27:36.430
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

575
00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

584
00:28:00.921 --> 00:28:03.860
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as a legit </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory.</v>

<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

587
00:28:08.871 --> 00:28:10.880
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as real conspiracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>

588
00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up the Gulf of Tonkin.</v>

589
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Gulf of Tonkin incident is a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theory where the government </v>

590
00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:24.011
<v Speaker 1>really did lie and say that there was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack on American citizens and that's </v>

591
00:28:24.011 --> 00:28:27.580
<v Speaker 1>what got us into the Vietnam War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look up the lookup.</v>

592
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:32.620
<v Speaker 1>The northwoods document.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The northwoods document is a real </v>

593
00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:36.131
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy that the joint chiefs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff drafted up and signed and then it </v>

594
00:28:36.131 --> 00:28:40.751
<v Speaker 1>was vetoed by Kennedy and what it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>was basically they were trying to get </v>

595
00:28:40.751 --> 00:28:44.420
<v Speaker 1>people enthusiastic about a war with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba and they were going to plan attacks</v>

596
00:28:44.421 --> 00:28:45.800
<v Speaker 1>on American civilians.</v>

597
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:51.010
<v Speaker 1>They were going to blow up an airliner </v>
<v Speaker 1>and blame it on Cuba and say that </v>

598
00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Americans were on board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were going to attack ships.</v>

599
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.490
<v Speaker 1>They were gonna attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo Bay.</v>

600
00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.980
<v Speaker 1>They were going to throw mortars into at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo Bay,</v>

601
00:28:57.981 --> 00:29:02.981
<v Speaker 1>and they were ready for us casualties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant they were willing to kill </v>

602
00:29:02.981 --> 00:29:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Americans in order to get us to go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>war with Cuba,</v>

603
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:09.080
<v Speaker 1>but these are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look up how fucking cigarettes.</v>

604
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:14.290
<v Speaker 1>You want to read theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can politicians all want to talk </v>

605
00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:14.960
<v Speaker 1>about drugs and we need to keep drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of schools.</v>

606
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Drugs in this country can't even fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>come close to the death and destruction </v>

607
00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.240
<v Speaker 1>that health problems that cigarettes </v>
<v Speaker 1>have cost,</v>

608
00:29:22.241 --> 00:29:25.610
<v Speaker 1>but yet you don't hear a peep out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys about cigarettes.</v>

609
00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Cigarettes kill 400,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people a year in this country alone.</v>

610
00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Every fucking year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real legit conspiracy where no </v>

611
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.170
<v Speaker 1>one is talking about it.</v>

612
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.620
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why they're not talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is because tobacco companies,</v>

613
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.780
<v Speaker 1>finance campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician,</v>

614
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:44.300
<v Speaker 1>those are conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a conspiracy is,</v>

615
00:29:44.301 --> 00:29:48.480
<v Speaker 1>as someone conspires to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's hundreds of legit conspiracies.</v>

616
00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:52.690
<v Speaker 1>Look up the Iran Contra affair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look up the fact that Oliver North and</v>

617
00:29:52.691 --> 00:29:56.650
<v Speaker 1>all those guys were involved in doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal shit in order to,</v>

618
00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:01.740
<v Speaker 1>to help to bring in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want seeing where they bring </v>

619
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.010
<v Speaker 1>cocaine into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the US.</v>

620
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:02.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

621
00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:07.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the accusation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a bunch of books that had </v>

622
00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.171
<v Speaker 1>been written that and CIA agents who </v>
<v Speaker 1>have said that there was a guy named </v>

623
00:30:10.171 --> 00:30:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Gary Webb who's got a bunch of shit on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and it was a dude named barry seal </v>

624
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.910
<v Speaker 1>who actually was bringing in cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 1>from other countries.</v>

625
00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Got caught and when he was about to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to trial was murdered.</v>

626
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 3>And that was to go the bringing coke </v>
<v Speaker 3>from at,</v>

627
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.570
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

630
00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:31.540

632
00:30:33.601 --> 00:30:37.680

<v Speaker 1>some CIA I'm sure do that.</v>

633
00:30:37.681 --> 00:30:39.390
<v Speaker 1>But the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

634
00:30:39.391 --> 00:30:44.391
<v Speaker 1>one of the planes that's been to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo Bay crashed last year in </v>

635
00:30:44.391 --> 00:30:48.861
<v Speaker 1>Mexico with four tons of cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put up that link.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

638
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 1>it didn't make any of the big news </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs.</v>

639
00:30:58.571 --> 00:30:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I'll put up that link for you guys.</v>

640
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

641
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.920
<v Speaker 1>But this is the fucking CIA plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

642
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Polite.</v>

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.150
<v Speaker 3>The two [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were two black dudes that were the</v>

646
00:31:14.151 --> 00:31:15.800
<v Speaker 3>ones at all funnel through.</v>

647
00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

648
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:26.450
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line about human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>though is that people are so </v>

649
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.860
<v Speaker 1>lackadaisical when it comes to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they,</v>

650
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:31.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could add that stuff could be on the</v>

651
00:31:31.141 --> 00:31:33.430
<v Speaker 1>news and people would care more about </v>
<v Speaker 1>John and kate.</v>

652
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John has to pay $10,000</v>

<v Speaker 1>a month in child support and alimony who</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going to do it?</v>

654
00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:44.780
<v Speaker 1>And that would be big news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas people wouldn't give a fuck </v>

655
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:44.780
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

656
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.120
<v Speaker 1>the CIA selling drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>

657
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:50.210
<v Speaker 1>all you have to do is have one person on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television say it's bullshit and that's </v>

658
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:50.210
<v Speaker 1>all the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

659
00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:54.921
<v Speaker 1>that's all you need to get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of the people to believe </v>

660
00:31:54.921 --> 00:31:54.921
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

661
00:31:54.921 --> 00:31:57.760
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and a lot of those shows and a lot of </v>

662
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:57.760
<v Speaker 3>the news ones that there's people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they do for a living,</v>

663
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.610
<v Speaker 3>they say they can put their name in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>database to be an expert about whatever.</v>

664
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:05.030
<v Speaker 3>And then CNN or Fox or go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need a guy that knows about.</v>

665
00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:08.050
<v Speaker 3>And then you're the expert on drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>

666
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been proven that oil companies have</v>

667
00:32:11.471 --> 00:32:16.471
<v Speaker 1>hired scientists to dispute the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings have created global </v>

668
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

669
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:22.530
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right or wrong when it comes to </v>

670
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:22.530
<v Speaker 1>global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people that arguing,</v>

671
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:24.550
<v Speaker 1>they arguing from the point of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative or being a liberal.</v>

672
00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Liberals always say we have to stop and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative say there's no connection.</v>

673
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's just because they're a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fucking parents.</v>

674
00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.810
<v Speaker 1>They here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

675
00:32:31.811 --> 00:32:35.190
<v Speaker 1>all these different people rush limbo or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever on the radio saying that there's</v>

676
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.200
<v Speaker 1>no connection that you're these shortly </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberals and they just repeat the same </v>

677
00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.140
<v Speaker 1>dumb shit and conservatives do that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then liberals,</v>

678
00:32:42.141 --> 00:32:47.141
<v Speaker 1>they see that fucking Al Gore Cock </v>
<v Speaker 1>sucker and then go Al Gore so that me </v>

679
00:32:47.141 --> 00:32:49.220
<v Speaker 1>and my boards made a billion dollars off</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this fucking climate gate.</v>

680
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:52.250
<v Speaker 1>If you look at like what Al Gore has </v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

681
00:32:52.251 --> 00:32:54.910
<v Speaker 1>the money that Al Gore's made since an </v>
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient truth came out,</v>

682
00:32:54.911 --> 00:32:56.090
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking staggering.</v>

683
00:32:56.330 --> 00:33:01.330
<v Speaker 1>He's made an incredible amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>off of this and the people that would </v>

684
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.090
<v Speaker 1>benefit from all these carbon taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

685
00:33:02.091 --> 00:33:04.430
<v Speaker 1>they're setting this up to make money </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what they're doing.</v>

686
00:33:04.431 --> 00:33:05.860
<v Speaker 1>No one's doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

687
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a few scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing with the right intentions,</v>

688
00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:13.690
<v Speaker 1>but most of the politicians have to push</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in as they have ulterior motives </v>

689
00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:13.690
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to make money off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>

690
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan.</v>

691
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Did you hear Johnny Bananas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty one at Gmail Dot com says,</v>

692
00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.110
<v Speaker 1>who'd you hear that the y chromosome is </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolving faster than the x chromosome?</v>

693
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:26.840
<v Speaker 1>That's because we're men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

694
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Johnny bananas were the only ones with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the why.</v>

695
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 1>The women don't get the why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The why is the future.</v>

696
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just saw,</v>

697
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:36.930
<v Speaker 3>I just saw a documentary about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

698
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.110
<v Speaker 3>that males are disappearing because of </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the chemicals.</v>

699
00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:40.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that too,</v>

700
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.220
<v Speaker 3>that that's why guys act more girlish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

701
00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.500
<v Speaker 3>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

702
00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:46.800
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

703
00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a surplus of men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>

704
00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:52.810
<v Speaker 1>when there's a search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's a surplus of men rather men</v>

705
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:58.230
<v Speaker 1>act more aggressive and grow more facial</v>
<v Speaker 1>hair and become more masculine and have </v>

706
00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.040
<v Speaker 1>more testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When there's a surplus of women,</v>

707
00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:05.190
<v Speaker 1>men tend to relax and they tend to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more feminine and they tend to shave </v>

708
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.050
<v Speaker 1>more and be more metrics.</v>

709
00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.130
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one was about that.</v>

710
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.570
<v Speaker 3>The other chemicals that probably our </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents,</v>

711
00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:15.580
<v Speaker 3>our parents parents did in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the plastics and all that kind of </v>

712
00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:16.900
<v Speaker 3>stuff where they said wasn't bad for </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

713
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Now they realized it is and for some </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason that those chemicals affect men </v>

714
00:34:22.691 --> 00:34:25.240
<v Speaker 3>more like defined the alligators that </v>
<v Speaker 3>live by,</v>

715
00:34:25.241 --> 00:34:26.950
<v Speaker 3>let's say Dow in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

716
00:34:26.951 --> 00:34:30.900
<v Speaker 3>in the swamps had smaller balls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then alligators,</v>

717
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

718
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.020
<v Speaker 3>generations earlier that all those </v>
<v Speaker 3>chemicals were shrinking.</v>

719
00:34:35.021 --> 00:34:40.021
<v Speaker 3>The alligator balls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what job you have that </v>

720
00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:40.090
<v Speaker 3>that's your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That one guy goes,</v>

721
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.260
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to measure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get her balls.</v>

722
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:42.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

723
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.640
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to measure it and we might </v>
<v Speaker 3>need this data later.</v>

724
00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:50.700
<v Speaker 3>But that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what they say is just from all </v>

725
00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.670
<v Speaker 3>the chemicals and stuff that men are </v>
<v Speaker 3>acting less like Matt and producing more</v>

726
00:34:51.671 --> 00:34:54.740
<v Speaker 3>sperm I think in the sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Less the girl.</v>

727
00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:59.900
<v Speaker 3>No less from like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so young guys now have less sperm than </v>

728
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:02.200
<v Speaker 3>their dad probably have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it should be the internet,</v>

729
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:07.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're getting rid of more spring in our </v>

730
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.370
<v Speaker 3>guides</v>

731
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:11.770
<v Speaker 1>because we're jerking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have it.</v>

732
00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.840
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's very much more difficult for </v>
<v Speaker 1>your dad or your dad about masturbation </v>

733
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.270
<v Speaker 1>because they used to have to set up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>projector that pull the shades down,</v>

734
00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:26.370
<v Speaker 1>pull the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run that little 16 millimeter black and </v>

735
00:35:26.370 --> 00:35:29.380
<v Speaker 1>white old lady molestation nowadays too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the odds are.</v>

736
00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually goes down.</v>

737
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have or go even back further </v>

738
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.841
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was guys had to put up the </v>

739
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:41.491
<v Speaker 1>projector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even go the guys before that had the </v>

740
00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:44.390
<v Speaker 1>paint stuff on walls in caves and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that there's way more people </v>

741
00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:46.830
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's way more molestation.</v>

742
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:51.160
<v Speaker 1>But per capita I'm wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder the Japanese,</v>

743
00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese believe that if you show </v>
<v Speaker 1>all that shit,</v>

744
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you show rape and molestation and crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

745
00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's why they're in a school.</v>

746
00:35:57.451 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 1>Girls on that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel like that.</v>

747
00:35:59.011 --> 00:36:04.011
<v Speaker 1>It gets it out of your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if you watch like violence in in </v>

748
00:36:04.011 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 1>video and movie form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that somehow or another,</v>

749
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:05.760
<v Speaker 1>it gets it out of your system.</v>

750
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Why did they blur all their porn?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now?</v>

751
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.360
<v Speaker 1>The only blur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pubes yeah,</v>

752
00:36:09.361 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

753
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're allowed to get fucked by a </v>

754
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.430
<v Speaker 3>technical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he can't see it.</v>

755
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Speaker 3>Can't you see pussy or indeed not bad </v>
<v Speaker 3>witness reload.</v>

756
00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:23.310
<v Speaker 3>But if you squint,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in the old days in the news,</v>

757
00:36:23.311 --> 00:36:27.270
<v Speaker 3>if you squint you can see this magic and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then I find myself like squinting going.</v>

758
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:32.510
<v Speaker 3>There's other porn that I can be </v>
<v Speaker 3>watching that's way more like the old </v>

759
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:34.170
<v Speaker 3>old school kind of French kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>European pork.</v>

760
00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember my news when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

761
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:40.820
<v Speaker 1>the old days when you would go on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>road and you'd go to hotel rooms and the</v>

762
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.960
<v Speaker 1>dirty movies would be scrambled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would only be like legally.</v>

763
00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can get online through them and </v>

764
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you'd see like a Ted that would go into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mouth and you,</v>

765
00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:56.140
<v Speaker 1>you'd have enough to jerk off to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be able to use to be able to </v>

766
00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:58.250
<v Speaker 1>get like a three or four minute preview </v>
<v Speaker 1>to see if you want it.</v>

767
00:36:58.251 --> 00:37:03.251
<v Speaker 1>So you'd have 10 and hit the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>preview.</v>

768
00:37:03.381 --> 00:37:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I was proud of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

769
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:09.970
<v Speaker 1>I would get hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then as the preview was going to be </v>

770
00:37:09.970 --> 00:37:12.790
<v Speaker 1>done in 15 seconds and with the vhs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if we borrowed from somebody you </v>

771
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:17.501
<v Speaker 1>could see like what their thing was </v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you put it in and hit play </v>

772
00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:17.600
<v Speaker 1>whatever scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that,</v>

773
00:37:17.601 --> 00:37:19.700
<v Speaker 1>that they just had stopped after they </v>
<v Speaker 1>were done.</v>

774
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:20.570
<v Speaker 1>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

775
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did someone have a bit about that.</v>

776
00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:25.520
<v Speaker 1>Chris rock had a bit about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you know,</v>

777
00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:30.730
<v Speaker 1>how he went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out one of his porns and he had </v>

778
00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:32.540
<v Speaker 1>left at a certain scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then because of the vhs tape,</v>

779
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:36.290
<v Speaker 1>when he went to it the next time it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a different scene is like someone's been</v>

780
00:37:36.291 --> 00:37:39.380
<v Speaker 1>watching my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so true.</v>

781
00:37:39.381 --> 00:37:41.120
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was.</v>

782
00:37:41.121 --> 00:37:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this 18 vcr.</v>

784
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And then leave it in there when you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it back or something or you'd rip off of</v>

785
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:52.360

<v Speaker 4>I'll think of something usually when I'm</v>

<v Speaker 1>John Headphones.</v>

844
00:40:13.361 --> 00:40:14.880
<v Speaker 1>A loser should've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should</v>

845
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.200
<v Speaker 3>are scam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Scam.</v>

846
00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.450
<v Speaker 3>Because you always see those at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>first.</v>

847
00:40:19.451 --> 00:40:24.451
<v Speaker 3>Whatever the whatever you're looking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always see the word scam at the top </v>

848
00:40:24.451 --> 00:40:24.451
<v Speaker 3>and then when you click on whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

849
00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:29.520
<v Speaker 3>it just pro whatever you're looking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think naturally if you're </v>

850
00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.180
<v Speaker 3>looking to buy something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the scam,</v>

851
00:40:31.181 --> 00:40:33.130
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'll go to the negative first.</v>

852
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

854
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that makes sense.</v>

855
00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:39.790
<v Speaker 4>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's awful.</v>

856
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:42.730
<v Speaker 4>There's a company called rip off report </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is like,</v>

857
00:40:42.731 --> 00:40:47.731
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how this is legal at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If somebody's mad at your company or </v>

858
00:40:47.731 --> 00:40:50.320
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can put something on there.</v>

859
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:55.470
<v Speaker 4>And what this company does is it uses </v>
<v Speaker 4>spam techniques where it spans like </v>

860
00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:58.480
<v Speaker 4>message boards and all this shit all day</v>
<v Speaker 4>long.</v>

861
00:40:58.481 --> 00:41:00.730
<v Speaker 4>So Google puts it on the top of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>list.</v>

862
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.960
<v Speaker 4>So my friend has a fashion company that </v>
<v Speaker 4>does like dresses and stuff like that.</v>

863

<v Speaker 4>And the first thing that comes up when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you google is rip off report,</v>

<v Speaker 4>well if you give us $2,000,</v>

867
00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:17.950
<v Speaker 4>we'll take it off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

868
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:18.640
<v Speaker 4>what</v>

869
00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:25.340
<v Speaker 1>second?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the company that reports on people </v>

870
00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:25.720
<v Speaker 1>for scams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically just extorting.</v>

871
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:30.900
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's called ripoff report and then in a </v>

872
00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:32.200
<v Speaker 4>funny thing is that you receive them and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll take your name off of it.</v>

873
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:37.590
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A rip off report dot Com and it seems </v>

874
00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:38.070
<v Speaker 4>like it's a legit company.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you have a problem with,</v>

875
00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:43.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like somebody's business or something </v>

876
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:45.591
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can say you can write a letter like </v>

877
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:45.591
<v Speaker 4>this person ripped me off and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

878
00:41:45.591 --> 00:41:46.740
<v Speaker 4>That's extortion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>extortion.</v>

879
00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.490
<v Speaker 4>And if you go online there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people suing this company or is it about</v>

880
00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.900
<v Speaker 4>12 different lawsuits going on for this </v>
<v Speaker 4>company right now,</v>

881
00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:55.020
<v Speaker 4>but she's been trying everything to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>the shit off.</v>

883
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.610

<v Speaker 3>I don't know how successful,</v>

887
00:42:12.111 --> 00:42:14.720
<v Speaker 3>but either way it's people like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have the report.</v>

888
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.760

<v Speaker 3>go after them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

890
00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.170

<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>

891
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:25.070
<v Speaker 3>I was going to sue a company recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was just,</v>

892
00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:28.370
<v Speaker 3>it ended up being just so much money </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you had to go,</v>

893
00:42:28.371 --> 00:42:33.371
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do I want to use that just to say that </v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm right</v>

895
00:42:33.371 --> 00:42:33.490

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

898
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

899
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:45.840
<v Speaker 3>like libel or something.</v>

900

<v Speaker 3>My special guest this week is John Half </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ron.</v>

909
00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:13.920

<v Speaker 3>which is twitter.</v>

912
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I've had a lot of people ask me how many</v>
<v Speaker 3>percentages of artists' twitters are </v>

913
00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.920
<v Speaker 3>have to do with suicide or no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say a shitty of some type</v>

914

<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

917
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.300
<v Speaker 1>The reason why we're not getting high it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because up until a few moments ago,</v>

918
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:45.420
<v Speaker 1>my little baby was in the house and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom and the baby and we're in the media </v>

920
00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:51.610
<v Speaker 4>there's no ventilation up in this bitch </v>
<v Speaker 4>high.</v>

921
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:53.680
<v Speaker 4>He's down here with a shotgun in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth.</v>

<v Speaker 3>have you about deleting your mind space?</v>

927
00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:23.410
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm actually to the point where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking by deleting my mind space,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'll throw it nine out of 10 times.</v>

00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll throw it up on my space as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because I think more people</v>

931
00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:38.380
<v Speaker 3>a few more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll read it my space because it has </v>

932
00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:39.820
<v Speaker 3>the date and you don't have to be a fan </v>
<v Speaker 3>to actually see the dates,</v>

933
00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.430
<v Speaker 4>so you don't have to be a fancy that </v>
<v Speaker 4>taste.</v>

934
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:44.020
<v Speaker 4>So you see there's two different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Facebook is really confusing.</v>

935
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.260
<v Speaker 4>There's a fan page.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have a fan page or something else that</v>

936
00:44:47.261 --> 00:44:49.420
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to be a fan to to see the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dates.</v>

937
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.160
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

<v Speaker 4>what's the two?</v>

939
00:44:52.751 --> 00:44:55.750
<v Speaker 4>It's a fan page and a group and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>group.</v>

940
00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:57.310
<v Speaker 4>It's so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Facebook,</v>

941
00:44:57.311 --> 00:44:58.090
<v Speaker 4>so knowing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

942
00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:01.610
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Facebook by the way is A.</v>

943
00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.510
<v Speaker 3>I don't want any more pillows sent to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

944
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.530

<v Speaker 4>You turn off any kind of event.</v>

947
00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Pillows are blessings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate that.</v>

948
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:12.540
<v Speaker 3>How do you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in your settings,</v>

949
00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.010
<v Speaker 3>so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's this pillow fight,</v>

950
00:45:15.011 --> 00:45:18.060
<v Speaker 3>so you'll go to your thing and there'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>be like 50 people hit you with pillows.</v>

951
00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:21.380
<v Speaker 3>I want to find the dude who invented </v>
<v Speaker 3>glitter kegs,</v>

<v Speaker 4>1000 followers finally got exit forever.</v>

996
00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.610
<v Speaker 3>I tried to keep mine too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go in spurts with twitter,</v>

997
00:47:13.611 --> 00:47:15.500
<v Speaker 3>sometimes I want a twitter three in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>row,</v>

998
00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:18.680
<v Speaker 3>but then I'll then I'll feel bad and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then won't do any for like a day or two,</v>

999
00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:24.490
<v Speaker 3>but then I realized everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>following a lot of people so it's not </v>

1000
00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:24.490
<v Speaker 3>that annoying.</v>

1001
00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:25.990
<v Speaker 4>It's weird how like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so different.</v>

1002
00:47:25.991 --> 00:47:30.991
<v Speaker 4>Like my space,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had no problem getting frames on or </v>

1003
00:47:30.991 --> 00:47:30.991
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

1004
00:47:30.991 --> 00:47:35.310
<v Speaker 3>but with twitter people are a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 3>more picky because they have to read </v>

1005
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:35.430
<v Speaker 3>your shit everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That again,</v>

1006
00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:40.450
<v Speaker 3>it's different how like twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like some people are huge on twitter,</v>

1007
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:45.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't think there they are like </v>

1008
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.510
<v Speaker 3>twitter makes no sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now numbers why?</v>

1009
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:49.850
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Aston Kutcher is the most popular </v>

1010
00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:53.100
<v Speaker 3>magazines and it goes on CNN and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>talks about his twitter on CNN and Larry</v>

1011
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:55.180
<v Speaker 3>King every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's not even a quarter.</v>

1012
00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:00.400
<v Speaker 3>That fucking dinosaur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody gives a shit about it.</v>

1013
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Larry King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young people with twitter don't give</v>

1014
00:48:02.931 --> 00:48:07.931
<v Speaker 1>a fuck about Larry King,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they certainly give a fuck about </v>

1015
00:48:07.931 --> 00:48:10.061
<v Speaker 1>Aston Kutcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that handsome devil with his elderly </v>

1016
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:10.160
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They love that dude.</v>

1017
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Wonder how long are going to keep her </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Ashton's only like fucking 27 </v>

1018
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.910
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1019
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it?</v>

1020
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:18.500
<v Speaker 3>He's got me in his thirties now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like.</v>

1021
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1022
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Let's say he's 35.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1023
00:48:20.791 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 3>Then she's 47 at 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Forty years.</v>

1024
00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.840

<v Speaker 1>Who?</v>

1025
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:28.610
<v Speaker 3>That's a tough sell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's great.</v>

<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three times.</v>

1081
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:14.500
<v Speaker 1>I got tap three times last month and was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

1082
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.780
<v Speaker 1>moving back to la from Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in,</v>

1083
00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I was out of shape.</v>

1084
00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't training that much and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1085
00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you roll with good guys to get tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're tired.</v>

1086
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:26.840
<v Speaker 1>When you roll like after the first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first guy you know,</v>

1087
00:51:26.841 --> 00:51:31.100
<v Speaker 1>you drill the way we do it a 10th planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your drill for the first half hour,</v>

1088
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:35.840
<v Speaker 1>40 minutes and that gets you tired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still have good energy.</v>

1089
00:51:35.841 --> 00:51:38.570
<v Speaker 1>But then the first role you have full </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

1090
00:51:38.571 --> 00:51:40.130
<v Speaker 1>you know the first role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel great,</v>

1091
00:51:40.131 --> 00:51:42.830
<v Speaker 1>but if you roll with a tough guy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody attends planet,</v>

1092
00:51:42.831 --> 00:51:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean your role with Brown belts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>purple belts,</v>

1093
00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:50.140
<v Speaker 1>all those dudes are tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those dudes are capable of tapping </v>

1094
00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.391
<v Speaker 1>you out and then it's a matter of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much endurance you have because if you </v>

1095
00:51:52.391 --> 00:51:52.880
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself in bad positions,</v>

1096
00:51:52.881 --> 00:51:57.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're pulling guard all </v>

1097
00:51:57.881 --> 00:51:59.651
<v Speaker 1>the time because I'm trying to work on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my bottom game now to try to work on my </v>

1098
00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 1>guard.</v>

1099
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:02.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get tapped,</v>

1100
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:03.860
<v Speaker 1>I get tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

1101
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I get tapped all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once a month.</v>

1102
00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:07.520
<v Speaker 1>If you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get tapped,</v>

1103
00:52:07.521 --> 00:52:10.670
<v Speaker 1>you either not rolling with good people </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you're not trying.</v>

1104
00:52:10.671 --> 00:52:13.520
<v Speaker 1>You're not opening yourself up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't open your game up,</v>

1105
00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:15.380
<v Speaker 1>you don't improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotTa,</v>

1106
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:16.220
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1107
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:21.250
<v Speaker 1>if I just wanted to get on top all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and always hold position and not </v>

1108
00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:24.731
<v Speaker 1>take any chances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could go a year without getting </v>

1109
00:52:24.731 --> 00:52:25.340
<v Speaker 1>tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to learn and you want to</v>

1110
00:52:25.341 --> 00:52:28.220
<v Speaker 1>develop your game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't worry about being tapped.</v>

1111
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.630
<v Speaker 1>When you get tapped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to go,</v>

1112
00:52:29.631 --> 00:52:31.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one more way that I won't get to.</v>

1113
00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Our friend Scott got me in this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>arm bar from inside my guard.</v>

1114
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:42.010
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had him in my car and he got me in an </v>

1115
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:42.010
<v Speaker 1>arm bar that's never happened before.</v>

1116
00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:44.960
<v Speaker 1>It's some crazy thing where as you scoop</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the leg to try to toss the guy and</v>

1117
00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:48.170
<v Speaker 1>get him in an arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has this way of locking your arm with</v>

1118
00:52:48.171 --> 00:52:51.140
<v Speaker 1>his leg and they pulls on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real dangerous felony.</v>

1119
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:53.620
<v Speaker 1>My elbow was going to go and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I to get that.</v>

1121
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:58.610
<v Speaker 1>And then I had them show it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he tried to do it again,</v>

1122
00:52:58.660 --> 00:52:59.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day before yesterday.</v>

1123
00:52:59.811 --> 00:53:02.030

<v Speaker 1>but it's just because he got me in it.</v>

<v Speaker 5>new.</v>

<v Speaker 6>families fight for their son.</v>

1178
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:59.080
<v Speaker 6>Micah in Victoria.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you say that sounds so shocking to </v>

1179
00:55:59.080 --> 00:55:59.080
<v Speaker 6>so many,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but California's prop 2:15,</v>

1180
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:04.350
<v Speaker 6>the compassionate use act was passed by </v>
<v Speaker 6>voters a decade ago and it tells a lot </v>

1181
00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:07.360
<v Speaker 6>of seriously ill patients with a </v>
<v Speaker 6>doctor's recommendation to use marijuana</v>

1182
00:56:07.361 --> 00:56:10.120
<v Speaker 6>legally,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but what about for children?</v>

1183
00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:14.270
<v Speaker 6>We did find this one family with a truly</v>
<v Speaker 6>remarkable tale to tell us in this case,</v>

1184
00:56:14.271 --> 00:56:15.880
<v Speaker 6>Ela exclusive report.</v>

1185
00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:19.490
<v Speaker 5>Tell me what the school's like.</v>

1186
00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:29.230
<v Speaker 6>This is Sam 10 year old who lives with </v>
<v Speaker 6>his dad,</v>

1187
00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:32.520
<v Speaker 6>his mom and his sister Lucy in northern </v>
<v Speaker 6>California.</v>

1188
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:38.430
<v Speaker 6>Sam has autism from age two to age.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sam's disorder made him violent and </v>

1189
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:43.880
<v Speaker 6>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>His parents,</v>

1190
00:56:43.881 --> 00:56:47.330
<v Speaker 6>Steve and Angela were truly living a </v>
<v Speaker 6>nightmare every day</v>

1191
00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:52.890
<v Speaker 5>where he was hurting other children at </v>
<v Speaker 5>school and it places a lot of times </v>

1192
00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:57.161
<v Speaker 5>would be enlightened store and he would </v>
<v Speaker 5>just escalate this bolt off and go and </v>

1193
00:56:57.161 --> 00:56:59.710
<v Speaker 5>hit another child in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One time he pulled the TV game,</v>

1194
00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:04.430
<v Speaker 5>Dr Moore,</v>
<v Speaker 5>all the furniture and I got and I had to</v>

1195
00:57:04.431 --> 00:57:08.480
<v Speaker 5>put him in a food for maybe an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We just were.</v>

1196
00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:13.500
<v Speaker 5>His whole body was spasming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just later crying and older.</v>

1197
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.880
<v Speaker 6>Sam's parents worked with expert doctors</v>
<v Speaker 6>who recommended a succession of </v>

1198
00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:23.830
<v Speaker 6>conventional prescription medications </v>
<v Speaker 6>like risperdol and a host of others,</v>

1199
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:28.480
<v Speaker 6>but Sam just gained 20 pounds and became</v>
<v Speaker 6>harder to handle,</v>

1200
00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:29.680
<v Speaker 6>so</v>

1201
00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:31.670
<v Speaker 5>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

1202
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:34.560
<v Speaker 5>he's getting more interest,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is getting bigger and stronger now.</v>

1203
00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:38.040
<v Speaker 5>Least 20 pounds bigger from the </v>
<v Speaker 5>resperdol the child,</v>

1204
00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:43.041
<v Speaker 5>but we had grown to love was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just like when you looked at and </v>

1205
00:57:43.041 --> 00:57:45.840
<v Speaker 5>when you talked to him,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he had just disappeared.</v>

1206
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:51.510
<v Speaker 6>Finally at their wit's end and faced </v>
<v Speaker 6>with the very real prospect of needing </v>

1207
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:56.241
<v Speaker 6>to institutionalize their son.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sam's parents decided to try something </v>

1208
00:57:56.241 --> 00:58:00.620
<v Speaker 6>unconventional and controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Last year they began treating Sam with </v>

1209
00:58:00.841 --> 00:58:02.160
<v Speaker 6>medical marijuana.</v>

1210
00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:07.220
<v Speaker 5>When you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is the perfect medication for </v>

1211
00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:07.220
<v Speaker 5>that kind of behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just very calming.</v>

1212
00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:08.310
<v Speaker 5>So this is the medicine right here.</v>

1213
00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:12.410
<v Speaker 6>Steven Angela got a recommendation from </v>
<v Speaker 6>a medical cannabis doctor.</v>

1214
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:15.260
<v Speaker 6>They told Sam's pediatrician about their</v>
<v Speaker 6>plan,</v>

1215
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:19.370
<v Speaker 6>and Steve Grew Sam's new medicine in </v>
<v Speaker 6>their backyard.</v>

1216
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:24.490
<v Speaker 6>We had six plants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is where Steve took out his tomato </v>

1217
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:27.770
<v Speaker 6>plants to grow and then harvest the </v>
<v Speaker 6>cannabis from the marijuana flowers.</v>

1218
00:58:27.771 --> 00:58:32.771
<v Speaker 6>He could make a concentrated form what </v>
<v Speaker 6>people refer to as this ball represents </v>

1219
00:58:33.021 --> 00:58:37.950
<v Speaker 6>roughly four months of doses for Sam </v>
<v Speaker 6>later.</v>

1220
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:42.970
<v Speaker 6>Steve softens the cannabis with heat,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then takes what appears to be just a </v>

1221
00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:44.840
<v Speaker 6>speck of pond.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sam's Joe's for the day.</v>

1222
00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:49.060
<v Speaker 5>What affected the medical cannabis have </v>
<v Speaker 5>on Sam was the first time we did it.</v>

1223
00:58:49.450 --> 00:58:50.990
<v Speaker 5>We just wanted to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1224
00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:55.300
<v Speaker 5>to see if it would work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And it was just an amazing experience.</v>

1225
00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:56.610
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll never forget it,</v>

1226
00:58:56.611 --> 00:58:58.420
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to watch what happened to him.</v>

1227
00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:03.510
<v Speaker 5>It was just like this Bush and doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>tend to upgrade and this,</v>

1228
00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.030
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1229
00:59:05.031 --> 00:59:06.700
<v Speaker 5>obsessiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just like,</v>

1230
00:59:06.701 --> 00:59:08.860
<v Speaker 5>it just went away just like it just </v>
<v Speaker 5>calmed him down.</v>

1231
00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:09.660
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

1232
00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:13.560
<v Speaker 6>we were with the family.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We watched Steve put Sam's daily.</v>

1233
00:59:13.561 --> 00:59:16.440
<v Speaker 6>Joe sent a piece of melon and take it to</v>
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>

1234
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 6>Within roughly 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Be Effects were clear,</v>

1235
00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:32.830
<v Speaker 6>were earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sam had been animated an antsy after </v>

1236
00:59:32.830 --> 00:59:35.390
<v Speaker 6>eating his Spec of Sam became calm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>relaxed,</v>

1237
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.620
<v Speaker 6>and social.</v>

1238
00:59:38.530 --> 00:59:43.530
<v Speaker 5>As a mother,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how would you feel about people saying </v>

1239
00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:46.860
<v Speaker 5>to you that you're getting your son's </v>
<v Speaker 5>stone everyday for?</v>

1240
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.650
<v Speaker 5>At first I was very concerned about </v>
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>

1241
00:59:49.850 --> 00:59:53.640
<v Speaker 5>but recently I've been sharing the story</v>
<v Speaker 5>with more and more people,</v>

1242
00:59:53.641 --> 00:59:54.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends and coworkers,</v>

1243
00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:56.490
<v Speaker 5>and I find that your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more I tell people,</v>

1244
00:59:56.491 --> 00:59:59.530
<v Speaker 5>the more I share with people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the more comfortable I am with it.</v>

1245
00:59:59.531 --> 01:00:02.550
<v Speaker 5>It has saved our lives and I think about</v>
<v Speaker 5>what it's done for our son.</v>

1246
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:07.700
<v Speaker 6>Could stamp story help others.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Respected La area pediatrician </v>

1247
01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:11.841
<v Speaker 6>Christopher toles shirt says,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we don't know enough about cannabis for </v>

1248
01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:11.841
<v Speaker 6>kids,</v>

1249
01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:14.020
<v Speaker 5>for all the parents out there whose </v>
<v Speaker 5>children may have autism.</v>

1250
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.200
<v Speaker 5>I think the message here is that this is</v>
<v Speaker 5>intriguing information that needs more </v>

1251
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.921
<v Speaker 5>research before we can confidently say </v>
<v Speaker 5>that marijuana is a safe and effective </v>

1252
01:00:22.921 --> 01:00:23.360
<v Speaker 5>treatment for once,</v>

1253
01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.150
<v Speaker 6>but for this California family,</v>
<v Speaker 6>medical marijuana has literally being an</v>

1254
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:34.250
<v Speaker 6>answer to their prayers as homecoming </v>
<v Speaker 6>for their son.</v>

1255
01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.030
<v Speaker 6>It was just</v>

1256
01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:41.790
<v Speaker 5>medication that we saw on that gave us </v>
<v Speaker 5>the results that we were always hoping.</v>

1257
01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:45.990
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that really is a kid that he was</v>

1258
01:00:45.991 --> 01:00:47.440
<v Speaker 5>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was smiling.</v>

1259
01:00:48.290 --> 01:00:52.720
<v Speaker 5>He had lost that for so long and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>so sad and wondered if we'd ever seen it</v>

1260
01:00:52.721 --> 01:00:57.721
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It just feels like I have more control </v>

1261
01:00:57.721 --> 01:00:59.790
<v Speaker 5>to help my son instead of the baby on </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dr.</v>

1262
01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:04.790
<v Speaker 5>May have the best intentions with Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to do what's best for my son.</v>

1263
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:09.490
<v Speaker 5>For him.</v>

1264
01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:18.240
<v Speaker 6>One important notes that Sam's parents </v>
<v Speaker 6>tell us that they have followed the </v>

1265
01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:21.601
<v Speaker 6>letter of the law regarding his </v>
<v Speaker 6>medication and that they've wrote only </v>

1266
01:01:21.601 --> 01:01:22.900
<v Speaker 6>the amounts of marijuana that prompts </v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that want medical marijuana.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He does not get it.</v>

1296
01:02:42.151 --> 01:02:47.151
<v Speaker 1>That is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are drugs that are terrible for </v>

1302
01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:03.530

<v Speaker 1>but the what he says about marijuana is </v>

1303
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.050
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous because he lumps marijuana in</v>
<v Speaker 1>with like heroin and drugs.</v>
