<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.300
<v Speaker 1>one that a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a real gun.</v>

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.440

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.323
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>How are you fuckers doing great man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great to be on the show again.</v>

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Great to have you guys here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching your instagram the other</v>

9
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.620
<v Speaker 1>day and I was looking at you with fake</v>
<v Speaker 1>hips doing crazy fucking heavy dead</v>

10
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>lifts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

11
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am starting to dead lift a little bit</v>

12
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>more because I've been doing this</v>
<v Speaker 1>carnivore diet and I feel great and</v>

13
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason not to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:31.914
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I just figured if I can do it and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't hurt,</v>

16
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Diana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

17
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:36.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>I was going up until about 400 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I can still,</v>

19
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I think I can even get stronger now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I am so happy about is this is</v>

20
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>something squatting and deadlifting.</v>

21
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>It's something that was part of my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>all growing up.</v>

22
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>I was a power lifter all growing up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the one who got me into this shit</v>

23
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got taken away from me and I was</v>

24
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>really sad and disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Became a drug addict and an alcoholic</v>

25
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>because of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I can lift again.</v>

26
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>So I feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that unusual for someone who's got</v>

27
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>artificial hips to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>

28
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how many people don't know</v>

29
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>that I have artificial hips?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>I do know that Ed Cohen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the greatest power lifter of all</v>

31
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has two fake hips now,</v>

32
00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:13.561
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:16.960
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's still squat 600 gs</v>

34
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>at Eddie cone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check him out.</v>

35
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>He's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fake hips squatting 600 pounds.</v>

36
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>It sees that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the most effective</v>

37
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 1>replacement surgeries that they do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing.</v>

38
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great and a big deal.</v>

39
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a great surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before I got it done,</v>

40
00:01:35.611 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean I couldn't even get up out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chair.</v>

41
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be stuck,</v>

42
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stick places and um,</v>

43
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>before I got it done I couldn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>move at all.</v>

44
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>And then after I got it done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had botched one side.</v>

45
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>So one side went perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other side for two years was all</v>

46
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>screwed up and the doctors didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

47
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>What was screwed up about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cup,</v>

49
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a cup and then there's the ball</v>
<v Speaker 1>that goes into the cup.</v>

50
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>The Cup came loose and it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would shift around.</v>

51
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Now they think that the cup comes loose</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you do both hips at the</v>

52
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hammer one hip and the one side and</v>

53
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>then you're completely like a dead body</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost and they flip you over and it's</v>

54
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:14.010
<v Speaker 1>really an island actually when they flip</v>
<v Speaker 1>you over,</v>

55
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:17.910
<v Speaker 1>they think that's when the hit might</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that socket may come out.</v>

56
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.530
<v Speaker 1>So they're starting to to question doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>them both on the same day.</v>

57
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

58
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>I've heard of people getting one done</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a couple months later I would</v>

59
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>recommend getting one done because then</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I got my other one,</v>

60
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.670
<v Speaker 1>when I got the one that was messed up</v>
<v Speaker 1>redone and I had one good leg and one,</v>

61
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one leg to recover on,</v>

62
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>it was so much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to have the special toilet</v>

63
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>and all the other students are going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be on crutches instead of being in a</v>

64
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>wheelchair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably right.</v>

65
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>If you only had one bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually wasn't even on crutches.</v>

66
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>I came home from the hospital and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>day that I came home from the hospital I</v>

67
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was walking,</v>

68
00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>I even climbed a ladder and our mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelled at us and yelled at me because I</v>

69
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>climbed the ladder and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

70
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>He just got a hip surgery and I'm like I</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta change this light bulb.</v>

71
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I would think that one good benefit</v>

72
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 2>about weightlifting with the increase in</v>
<v Speaker 2>bone density and that he would want that</v>

73
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>if you have artificial hips especially</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause you got that bar that goes down</v>

74
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 2>deep into the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The hips got a Dexa scan done.</v>

75
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>Weird shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got really weird shit going on.</v>

76
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 2>We had a Dexa scan done and Dr. Jacob</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wilson told us that our Boleyn,</v>

77
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 2>was it bone mineral density density</v>
<v Speaker 2>density.</v>

78
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was mine.</v>

79
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 2>Mine was like off the charts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but his was way off the charts.</v>

80
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.760
<v Speaker 2>And then we also got a biopsy done by a</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Andy Galpin and he's just like,</v>

81
00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:33.244
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

82
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't the fuck's going on with your,</v>

83
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 2>with my muscle and his muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

84
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 2>but we need to talk about this morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's called steroids.</v>

85
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:40.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

86
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he said he wanted to interview me</v>

87
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>more in and talk to me more about like</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've taken over the years ago.</v>

88
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 2>It was different than works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works fantastic when people,</v>

89
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.890
<v Speaker 2>I just think I heard you talking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day about throwing a roundhouse</v>

90
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 2>kick and he said it's a second nature to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

91
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 2>And I think for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've been lifting for so long,</v>

92
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.400
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when I was a drug addict and</v>

93
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 2>alcoholic the entire time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still trained every day.</v>

94
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't doing as good of a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still would make it to the gym</v>

95
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 2>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's ingrained in us.</v>

96
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 2>It's something that we've been doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>

97
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>So I think the body is just designed for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

98
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 2>It's essentially designed for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not design,</v>

99
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 2>but you've sort of designed it and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think it's something that found us,</v>

100
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

101
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.780
<v Speaker 2>like we did kind of stumble upon it but</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's something that found us and</v>

102
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 2>I was strong right out of the gate.</v>

104
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 2>He was strong right out of the gate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I remember,</v>

105
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend's benching in the garage and</v>

106
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 2>they were benching the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a 10 on each side and I was,</v>

107
00:04:32.921 --> 00:04:33.754
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a plate,</v>

108
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 2>doing one 85,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 years old,</v>

109
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was an animal when he was younger.</v>

110
00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:39.720
<v Speaker 2>It's just something there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there some sort of strength.</v>

111
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 2>My Mom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mom bench,</v>

112
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.840
<v Speaker 2>what she meant to be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

113
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.730
<v Speaker 2>she'd been mom can bench one 35 like</v>
<v Speaker 2>right off,</v>

114
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like without ever lifting.</v>

115
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 2>I want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she benched one 85 she might've</v>

116
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.490

<v Speaker 2>they get mad.</v>

138
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it was spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were like,</v>

139
00:05:37.961 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 2>I could drink so much because I'm Irish.</v>

<v Speaker 2>The alliance.</v>

143
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.590

<v Speaker 2>reasons that you were so dumb.</v>

144
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I know that um,</v>

162
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.200
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of the wrestlers worked at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheetahs.</v>

163
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.030
<v Speaker 3>I know the Godfather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the wrestler,</v>

164
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 3>the Godfather,</v>

165
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 3>And I think some of these real quick and</v>
<v Speaker 3>real life,</v>

166
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 3>he's a real pantsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching some clips from last</v>

167
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 3>night from wrestlemania and Ronda Rousey</v>
<v Speaker 3>was with Kurt Angle and I was looking at</v>

168
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:53.890
<v Speaker 3>Kurt Angle's body.</v>

169
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 3>I was like wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's gone through some damage</v>

170
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 3>damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of neck surgeries.</v>

171
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 3>Well you could see it in his arms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The neck surgeries you see in guy's arms</v>

172
00:07:04.461 --> 00:07:05.650
<v Speaker 3>cause their arms atrophy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

173
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 3>He's at your feet a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah cause it's fucking neck.</v>

174

<v Speaker 3>above his ears.</v>

176
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 3>His arms are not nearly as to say as it</v>
<v Speaker 3>used to be.</v>

177
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:17.600
<v Speaker 3>I think it's nerve damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

178
00:07:17.601 --> 00:07:18.351
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

179
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.240
<v Speaker 3>I had Pat Miletich in here a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks ago,</v>

180
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.170
<v Speaker 3>you know former UFC champion pat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got one arm that's smaller than the</v>

181
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:25.880
<v Speaker 3>other one boss route and to be here</v>
<v Speaker 3>tomorrow,</v>

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 3>he's got the same issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Savage next neck issues for what you</v>

183
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had a bulging disc in my neck and</v>

184
00:07:32.391 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 3>I was getting weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a numbness in my hands and then nerve</v>

185
00:07:36.051 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 3>pain in my elbow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elbow,</v>

186
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 3>the Ulnar nerve.</v>

187
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.920
<v Speaker 3>It goes on there and when you ignore</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit and then keep training and</v>

188
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 3>keep getting your fucking neck yanked</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

189
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.920
<v Speaker 3>then the disc starts to decay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the pressing against the,</v>

190
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.020
<v Speaker 3>the the nerves and the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

192
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.390
<v Speaker 3>the spinal column,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gets worse and then it starts</v>

193
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 3>atrophying and cutting off the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nerves to your arms and you get to</v>

194
00:07:56.901 --> 00:07:59.180
<v Speaker 3>the point where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're shit just shrinks and it doesn't</v>

195
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:01.040
<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of that stuff happens in your</v>

196
00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:03.380
<v Speaker 3>sleep to like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something gets aggravated from training,</v>

197
00:08:03.381 --> 00:08:05.060
<v Speaker 3>but you sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where'd you sleep with your neck?</v>

198
00:08:05.061 --> 00:08:06.620
<v Speaker 3>All twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

199
00:08:06.621 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 3>that happened to Brian Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Brian Shaws 415 pounds.</v>

200
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:13.790
<v Speaker 3>But he said he wished he had a good</v>
<v Speaker 3>story for why his arm was atrophying,</v>

201
00:08:13.791 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 3>but it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he lost his grip strength 100%.</v>

202
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:18.080
<v Speaker 3>He's the world's strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strongest man.</v>

203
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>14 lost his grip strength and it was</v>

204
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.370
<v Speaker 3>mainly all through sleep.</v>

205
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 3>Got To sleep apnea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>study done,</v>

206
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 3>and then he got a see CPAP,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the c to help actually cured everything.</v>

207
00:08:26.931 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 3>He tried to do any and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing all kinds of different</v>

208
00:08:30.021 --> 00:08:33.020
<v Speaker 3>things to get his hand strength back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>it turned out his mainly asleep.</v>

209
00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.960
<v Speaker 3>He's too big to sleep on his side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

210
00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how's you have to sleep face forward?</v>

211
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 3>I think he has to sleep on his back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should get one of them.</v>

212
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:42.460
<v Speaker 3>Massage tables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just sleep at his whole,</v>

213
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 3>it was facing the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do that.</v>

214
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 3>You fall asleep on those things all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time and that's the only way to keep</v>

215
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:52.010
<v Speaker 3>from snoring is the thing with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a fat tongue and if I lie down on</v>

216
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:53.120
<v Speaker 3>my back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my tongue,</v>

217
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I have sleep apnea too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wear a mouthpiece.</v>

218
00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

219
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.700
<v Speaker 2>don't the of how some of these people</v>
<v Speaker 2>taping their mouth shit.</v>

220
00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do that where a chin strap and</v>

221
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 2>you can breathe through your nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll help.</v>

222
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you breathe through your</v>

223
00:09:05.101 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 2>mouth and your tongue falls back and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>came out of my mouth for improper,</v>

224
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.850
<v Speaker 2>you're not breathing properly would wake</v>
<v Speaker 2>up with headaches.</v>

225
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 2>I would just wake up tired and with</v>
<v Speaker 2>headaches.</v>

226
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

227
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I went to this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor [inaudible],</v>

228
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.310
<v Speaker 2>he's in Encino and he has this</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouthpiece that is essentially,</v>

229
00:09:20.311 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 2>it's a mouthpiece with like a tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It presses down like a tongue depressor</v>

230
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 2>presses down in your tongue and it keeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>your tongue from falling backward.</v>

231
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.600
<v Speaker 2>It was a fucking game changer for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

232
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I tried to tap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just changed.</v>

233
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to see pat for one night.</v>

234
00:09:32.881 --> 00:09:36.930
<v Speaker 2>I might get this fucking good robot</v>
<v Speaker 2>bullshit machine out of my face and mark</v>

235
00:09:36.931 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 2>didn't like it.</v>

236
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.340
<v Speaker 2>He got scared and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

237
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm claustrophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it scared the fuck out of me.</v>

238
00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

239
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:45.330
<v Speaker 2>I hated that shit on my face and I tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] the nose one.</v>

240
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 2>I tried the mouth when I can do either</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them mouthpiece</v>

241
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad and um,</v>

242
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 2>it's cleared up a lot by just losing</v>
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>

243
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.230
<v Speaker 2>but I think and less fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big thing.</v>

244
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a factor.</v>

245
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a factor for a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fat and their neck and everything.</v>

246
00:09:59.131 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 2>Just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was again and got so big,</v>

247
00:10:01.561 --> 00:10:03.320
<v Speaker 2>he can't actually fatter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I mean I,</v>

248
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I could see why that's a thing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>weightlifters.</v>

249
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting thing.</v>

250
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 2>You get so big that you can't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still some shit on your shirt.</v>

251
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 2>You spilled some coffee there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the worst.</v>

252
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.880
<v Speaker 2>Trying to wipe it up from getting a</v>
<v Speaker 2>stained.</v>

253
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:19.350
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

254
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 2>tell me about this carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cause I had Sean Baker in here and he</v>

255
00:10:23.221 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 2>talked to me about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't have any science,</v>

256
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:27.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no like he doesn't have any like</v>

257
00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:31.620
<v Speaker 2>real tests or any longterm studies or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

258
00:10:31.621 --> 00:10:33.440
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

259
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm a person who believes in balance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that you need fido nutrients.</v>

260
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:41.040
<v Speaker 2>You need plant fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of healthy stuff</v>

261
00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:43.000
<v Speaker 2>that you'd get from plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

262
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer in eating meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

263
00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:48.260
<v Speaker 2>but all meet you guys doing all me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

264
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.200
<v Speaker 2>I think there's modified it and think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some one at a time.</v>

265
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:53.100
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some,</v>

266
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some holes in every</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

267
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 2>I think when you go and you make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision to only eat meat,</v>

268
00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 2>then some rational thought should come</v>
<v Speaker 2>into your head.</v>

269
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:05.130
<v Speaker 2>Maybe when I switch all the way to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet all the time,</v>

270
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.680
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's a possibility I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat too much meat.</v>

271
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 2>And so maybe that would make sense to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bring in some fruit and bring in some</v>

272
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:14.790
<v Speaker 2>vegetables just so you're not eating too</v>
<v Speaker 2>much meat for the simple reason.</v>

273
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Vegetables have been shown and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>

274
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:18.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get a study to show you</v>

275
00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:19.890
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

276
00:11:19.891 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 2>but there's study a study that's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>done on 200,000 people that went on for</v>

277
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:25.760
<v Speaker 2>14 years and they studied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

278
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 2>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They study every type of vegetable and</v>

279
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:31.980
<v Speaker 2>they found that they were more neutral</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they were harmful or good for you.</v>

280
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:34.710
<v Speaker 2>They found that fruit was a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>better for you.</v>

281
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:36.330
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have any studies say,</v>

282
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:37.680
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does this study?</v>

283
00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.810
<v Speaker 2>It's called the pure study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute.</v>

284
00:11:39.811 --> 00:11:42.180
<v Speaker 2>They said it's the vegetables or</v>
<v Speaker 2>neutral.</v>

285
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're neutral.</v>

286
00:11:43.441 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 2>They're just really help you that much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't necessarily great and they</v>

287
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 2>weren't necessarily bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the Harrison to what</v>

288
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what their standard was for</v>

289
00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>what they were looking for exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But main thing they were looking</v>

290
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 1>for was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it being protective in terms of your</v>

291
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:58.720
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was their main,</v>

292
00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.260
<v Speaker 1>they're the main thing they were looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>

293
00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:03.730
<v Speaker 1>And so they found out that saturated fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>is protective of your heart.</v>

294
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 1>They found out that cholesterol is</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually protective of your heart.</v>

295
00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 1>It found out that salt is pr now it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all like,</v>

296
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.353
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

297
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.010
<v Speaker 1>you can't take in tons and tons of salt</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then something's gonna kill you.</v>

298
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 1>If you eat a pound of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dead,</v>

299
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:17.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assaults,</v>

300
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:18.700
<v Speaker 1>one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good for you.</v>

301
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>It's an essential mineral to a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>

302
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>but have to take too much of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think any of these things can be</v>

303
00:12:23.591 --> 00:12:26.650
<v Speaker 1>done too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I jumped on a carnivore diet just to</v>

304
00:12:26.651 --> 00:12:28.840
<v Speaker 1>give it a shot and to see exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about.</v>

305
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Because you talked to Sean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean Baker.</v>

306
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:31.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>

307
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 1>He was on your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got inspired to do it.</v>

308
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 1>He was already doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

309
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me try it out.</v>

310
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 1>I tried it out and got leaner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It felt better and I was like,</v>

311
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:41.290
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why did you start it?</v>

312
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:45.820
<v Speaker 1>So I was doing a ketogenic diet for over</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year and lost a lot of weight on that</v>

313
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.740
<v Speaker 1>was doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feeling really good man.</v>

314
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:49.740
<v Speaker 1>You look very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate it.</v>

315
00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I still have a long way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion.</v>

316
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.970
<v Speaker 1>This is a work in progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

317
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.470
<v Speaker 1>the reason I did it was really simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a dietary intervention.</v>

318
00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through sobriety as you know,</v>

319
00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.230
<v Speaker 1>I was a drug addict and an alcoholic for</v>
<v Speaker 1>about six years and when I went through</v>

320
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.820
<v Speaker 1>sobriety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

321
00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.230
<v Speaker 1>that's an intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>

322
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.370
<v Speaker 1>there's something wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a problem,</v>

323
00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:13.204
<v Speaker 1>we need to fix it.</v>

324
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 1>So my problem now was arthritis and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed something that was like an</v>

325
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>intervention that would get me from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

326
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being arthritic and in pain and not</v>

327
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:26.290
<v Speaker 1>being able to lift to being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lift.</v>

328
00:13:26.291 --> 00:13:30.100
<v Speaker 1>And so there's some of this might be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>placebo effect of me going like,</v>

329
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on this diet and I feel great and</v>

330
00:13:31.781 --> 00:13:32.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm,</v>

331
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm now lifting more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

332
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:38.170
<v Speaker 1>some of it may be a placebo effect and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay with me if it is,</v>

333
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.600
<v Speaker 1>but I feel excellent on this diet and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think the reason is,</v>

334
00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:45.610
<v Speaker 1>is I'm getting a lot more protein in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't getting enough protein on Kido</v>

335
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.140
<v Speaker 1>because I was listening to everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

336
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will knock you out of ketosis if you</v>

337
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 1>eat too much protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I constantly was being</v>

338
00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:53.440
<v Speaker 1>told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wasn't muscular.</v>

339
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't being able to put on muscle.</v>

340
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:57.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

341
00:13:57.751 --> 00:14:00.880
<v Speaker 1>you were constantly testing your blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

342
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Were you using a meter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

343
00:14:02.631 --> 00:14:04.360
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About three or four times.</v>

344
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:08.080
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm crazy with it because ptosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that would knock me out of</v>

345
00:14:08.081 --> 00:14:10.390
<v Speaker 1>Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just like mainly anything with</v>

346
00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.780
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

347
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.680
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really having too much of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with protein because I wasn't</v>

348
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.960
<v Speaker 1>eating a lot of protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

349
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:17.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

350
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.470
<v Speaker 1>there were things that if I cheated on</v>
<v Speaker 1>my diet for example,</v>

351
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:21.730
<v Speaker 1>of course that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

352
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:25.570
<v Speaker 1>he usually kicked me out of ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I also got to a point where you</v>

353
00:14:25.571 --> 00:14:29.380
<v Speaker 1>become so fat adapted that you become</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we like to call metabolically</v>

354
00:14:29.381 --> 00:14:32.050
<v Speaker 1>flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metabolic flexibility just means you can</v>

355
00:14:32.051 --> 00:14:34.220
<v Speaker 1>switch from being a fat burner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

356
00:14:34.221 --> 00:14:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm mostly a fat burner for the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>part because I'm eating high fat.</v>

357
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.430
<v Speaker 1>But then if I do eat something with</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar in it,</v>

358
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:42.270
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really affect me that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>

359
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.800
<v Speaker 1>because I'm used to it 90%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:14:44.801 --> 00:14:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Going with the fat so I can kind of move</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and forth between those two things.</v>

361
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.900
<v Speaker 1>But what I realized on the Diet when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>switched over to carnivore the whole</v>

362
00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:54.591
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

363
00:14:54.591 --> 00:14:56.210
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could just have an apple,</v>

364
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I would feel like I would feel so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>better cause just eating the steak,</v>

365
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:01.250
<v Speaker 1>it's killing me and it's driving me</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

366
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:04.700
<v Speaker 1>It was a killing just mentally I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>ready for it.</v>

367
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't tough enough to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

368
00:15:06.981 --> 00:15:11.981
<v Speaker 1>I'll just have steak on a plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you automatically use intermittent</v>

369
00:15:12.021 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 1>fasting almost cause you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't always have a hamburger in</v>

370
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:17.150
<v Speaker 1>your pocket or you don't always a run</v>
<v Speaker 1>through in and out Burger,</v>

371
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.080
<v Speaker 1>whoever it might be.</v>

372
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up utilizing some intermittent</v>

373
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:22.100
<v Speaker 1>fasting and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

374
00:15:22.101 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 1>the only food I have to eat as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hamburger or a steak</v>

375
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 1>and it was hamburger or a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

376
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>well how about an apple?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I talked to our friend Stan efforting</v>

377
00:15:31.491 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>who's a bodybuilder and he's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He jacked and he's also a power lifter</v>

378
00:15:34.911 --> 00:15:36.830
<v Speaker 1>and soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one years old,</v>

379
00:15:36.831 --> 00:15:39.470
<v Speaker 1>two and fucking Jack Soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the smartest guys I know.</v>

380
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.240
<v Speaker 1>And he sent me that study that I sent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you with the,</v>

381
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.240
<v Speaker 1>about the fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if you watched that or</v>

382
00:15:44.241 --> 00:15:46.460
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but basically they did a large scale</v>

383
00:15:46.461 --> 00:15:49.400
<v Speaker 1>study with fruit and they found out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

384
00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>the fruit actually would drive blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>glucose down instead of,</v>

385
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 1>instead of bringing it up when taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>with protein,</v>

386
00:15:56.420 --> 00:16:00.050
<v Speaker 1>like red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm like looking at this going</v>

387
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:00.381
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

388
00:16:00.381 --> 00:16:02.180
<v Speaker 1>if it's not going to drive my glucose</v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

389
00:16:02.181 --> 00:16:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean that'd be the one thing I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned with.</v>

390
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Why not have some fruit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that I'm in talking with Stan</v>

391
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.910
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was saying like,</v>

392
00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.590
<v Speaker 1>I think fruit is totally fine and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you can have as much as you want.</v>

393
00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.260
<v Speaker 1>And so I sort of switched over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's crazy though because that's,</v>

394
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:16.300
<v Speaker 1>that's sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

395
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body.</v>

396
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.110
<v Speaker 1>How did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was your body</v>

397
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.000
<v Speaker 1>glucose level?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've done studies where they've,</v>

398
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:26.600
<v Speaker 1>where they've studied fruit toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like everybody thinks fruit toast is</v>

399
00:16:26.601 --> 00:16:28.700
<v Speaker 1>really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think that because of high</v>

400
00:16:28.701 --> 00:16:33.050
<v Speaker 1>fructose corn syrup and fructose is</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad when it's outside of fruit.</v>

401
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

402
00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.090
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit has these phytonutrients that has</v>

403
00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:42.590
<v Speaker 1>fiber in it and those things sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like protecting you from what's going on</v>

404
00:16:42.591 --> 00:16:43.610
<v Speaker 1>in the sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually,</v>

405
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.880
<v Speaker 1>there's Fido nutrients in fruit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say an apple.</v>

406
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:50.870
<v Speaker 1>There's certain phytonutrients in there</v>
<v Speaker 1>that won't allow your small intestine</v>

407
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:51.920
<v Speaker 1>and like absorb the fat.</v>

408
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.110
<v Speaker 1>And so it actually helps you to digest</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like red meat that have high fat.</v>

409
00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.990
<v Speaker 1>There's fruit that help you digest the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugars in them and not,</v>

410
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it share it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor,</v>

411
00:17:03.051 --> 00:17:05.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm a filmmaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started,</v>

412
00:17:05.011 --> 00:17:05.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>

413
00:17:05.991 --> 00:17:08.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask a lot of questions that were a lot</v>

414
00:17:08.271 --> 00:17:11.660
<v Speaker 1>of people and start figuring things out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it's trial and error.</v>

415
00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now I'm in the trial trial and</v>

416
00:17:14.091 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 1>error part and it seems like it's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>working pretty good.</v>

417
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:18.590
<v Speaker 1>So No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you getting your blood work done?</v>

418
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

419
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:21.980
<v Speaker 1>just got my blood work done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

420
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:27.220
<v Speaker 1>from last month and everything improved</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Quito to carnivore.</v>

421
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really have any cholesterol</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

422
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any,</v>

423
00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

424
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:33.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>

425
00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.870
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am my issues that we've had our</v>

426
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:39.290
<v Speaker 1>bloodwork done probably four or five</v>
<v Speaker 1>times in the last year or so,</v>

427
00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

428
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

429
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all the numbers are,</v>

430
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.260
<v Speaker 1>are fucking great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part it's been pretty</v>

431
00:17:45.261 --> 00:17:46.760
<v Speaker 1>healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cholesterol has been good to</v>

432
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 1>triglycerides have been good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

433
00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.180
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't show up in your blood?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

434
00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.650
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the hot,</v>

435
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 1>not in the high range of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:56.610
<v Speaker 1>of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it shows you on the uh,</v>

437
00:17:57.090 --> 00:17:58.950
<v Speaker 1>on the sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we also had other people for</v>

438
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:00.210
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

439
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like the triglycerides and</v>

440
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 1>the cholesterol and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about,</v>

441
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what you soon,</v>

442
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.890
<v Speaker 1>what's not good?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

443
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's,</v>

444
00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.070
<v Speaker 1>everything's been pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this last time I did have my,</v>

445
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

446
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.500
<v Speaker 1>I had one of my markers Kinda high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both had high c reactive protein and we</v>

447
00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.780
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not sure why.</v>

448
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:25.230
<v Speaker 1>So that's something that we have to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at what is c reactive protein?</v>

449
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a marker for inflammation and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>react specifically of the heart.</v>

450
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good.</v>

451
00:18:29.981 --> 00:18:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And I see this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine was really high on Kido,</v>

452
00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:35.610
<v Speaker 1>but then after I went Keto to</v>
<v Speaker 1>carnivores,</v>

453
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:36.840
<v Speaker 1>it came way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way down.</v>

454
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:38.760
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it is right now.</v>

455
00:18:38.761 --> 00:18:42.630
<v Speaker 1>And I also had a really hot mine</v>
<v Speaker 1>registered really high at a nowhere.</v>

456
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.540
<v Speaker 1>It was totally fine with all the blood</v>
<v Speaker 1>work I've had done.</v>

457
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.090
<v Speaker 1>And the last one I had done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it skyrocketed.</v>

458
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.291
<v Speaker 1>People were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

459
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:53.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because you worked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand or what you consistent in</v>

460
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:56.340
<v Speaker 1>when you ate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you got your tests done,</v>

461
00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.230
<v Speaker 1>where are you guys on a fast train</v>
<v Speaker 1>beforehand?</v>

462
00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.360
<v Speaker 1>So I might've fucked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

463
00:19:00.361 --> 00:19:02.080
<v Speaker 1>you fucked it up for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

464
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it yourself after we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you train,</v>

465
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.280
<v Speaker 1>you train like a fuck the blood work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

466
00:19:08.281 --> 00:19:09.114
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

467
00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a snapshot in time and we hear that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot and I think that that's important</v>

468
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 1>to realize and recognize that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

469
00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one snapshot in time and we</v>

470
00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.300
<v Speaker 1>constantly change all the time.</v>

471
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.000
<v Speaker 1>So particularly important with dietary</v>
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol,</v>

472
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.580
<v Speaker 1>with cholesterol in the blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it registers.</v>

473
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.820
<v Speaker 1>If you have a big fat filled meal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then go and get a blood test versus you</v>

474
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:35.760
<v Speaker 1>fasting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like how was your body absorbing?</v>

475
00:19:35.761 --> 00:19:39.750
<v Speaker 1>This is what's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's your body absorbing these</v>

476
00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:42.110
<v Speaker 1>essential new nutrients?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not like what,</v>

477
00:19:42.111 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 1>what happens right after you eat because</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body knows what to do with that</v>

478
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:47.280
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My cholesterol was one 90,</v>

479
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.840
<v Speaker 1>which is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they want it,</v>

480
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.660
<v Speaker 1>they want it to be under 200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I thought it was really interesting</v>

481
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:56.661
<v Speaker 1>was my hdl went way up from a 60 points</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm going from Quito to carnivore.</v>

482
00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Well are you eating a lot of fatty cuts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like rib eyes,</v>

483
00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.610
<v Speaker 1>mostly rabbis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like a lot of dietary fat.</v>

484
00:20:05.611 --> 00:20:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I like a lot of like meat fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

485
00:20:07.531 --> 00:20:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a certain point right</v>
<v Speaker 1>because um,</v>

486
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

487
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Before when I was doing the ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

488
00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:16.210
<v Speaker 1>the fat is kind of free flowing because</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

489
00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 1>you make your bulletproof coffees and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just dump it back and everything</v>

490
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.790
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting butter on everything.</v>

491
00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.110
<v Speaker 1>But when you have doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

492
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>When you have a stake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really nice about having a stake</v>

493
00:20:25.081 --> 00:20:29.070
<v Speaker 1>is your rate about 65 to 75% fat</v>
<v Speaker 1>already?</v>

494
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Like just grinding corn after the box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

495
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.740
<v Speaker 1>You eating corn fed beef?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're going to be?</v>

496
00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:35.970
<v Speaker 1>I eat both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

497
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between the grass fed and</v>

498
00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:39.990
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the grain fred,</v>

499
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:43.980
<v Speaker 1>there really isn't a substantial amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of proof of how much better that is.</v>

500
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.650
<v Speaker 1>I do know that grass fed beef has five</v>
<v Speaker 1>times the amount of Omega three.</v>

501
00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.070
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

502
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.650
<v Speaker 3>you always want to pick grass fed beef</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you can,</v>

503
00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 3>but a lot of people can't afford it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>

504
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:54.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bet for me,</v>

505
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:58.390
<v Speaker 3>the best meat is at Costco.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the best tasting meat that you're</v>

506
00:20:58.391 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 3>going to find.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been everywhere.</v>

507
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.020
<v Speaker 3>It's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is costco better?</v>

508
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.050
<v Speaker 3>It just tastes the best around for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>

509
00:21:05.051 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 3>They have the best meat and it's called</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck some like expensive butcher shop.</v>

510
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.740
<v Speaker 3>It's corn fans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cosco standing.</v>

511
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.850
<v Speaker 3>Costco is all organic now too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

512
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.970
<v Speaker 3>that's a weird word though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That word is so loosely defined.</v>

513
00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.820
<v Speaker 3>Well we didn't spray it with a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>dad right before we give to,</v>

514
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There is a,</v>

515
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:26.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is exactly organic.</v>

516
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:29.450
<v Speaker 3>You have to pay to get organic status</v>
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

517
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.840
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you have to pay a lot of money.</v>

518
00:21:31.841 --> 00:21:34.940
<v Speaker 3>Cause I remember talking to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bulletproof and night,</v>

519
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.750
<v Speaker 3>the guy was telling me like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to uh,</v>

520
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.610
<v Speaker 3>to Dave Asprey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's telling me you have to pay money to</v>

521
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:41.950
<v Speaker 3>get recognized as being organic.</v>

522
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 3>So I have some sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy says,</v>

523
00:21:43.811 --> 00:21:44.940
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fat.</v>

524
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm saying.</v>

525
00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:50.290
<v Speaker 3>You have to pay to get it to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's true.</v>

526
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's true.</v>

527
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.740
<v Speaker 3>It is true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean I'm sure it costs money</v>

528
00:21:56.741 --> 00:21:59.140
<v Speaker 3>to get tested and to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're certified.</v>

529
00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Inside,</v>

530
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.210
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had to pay money for it.</v>

531
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

532
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.200
<v Speaker 3>there has to be some sort of regular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

533
00:22:05.201 --> 00:22:07.780
<v Speaker 3>but when you're looking at the standards</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

534
00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It means no antibiotics,</v>

535
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:10.870
<v Speaker 3>no added hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

536
00:22:10.871 --> 00:22:12.260
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it means?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe so.</v>

537
00:22:12.261 --> 00:22:12.881
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Marines,</v>

538
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 3>no pesticides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

539
00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:15.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

540
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.800
<v Speaker 3>excuse me for plants and vegetables or</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruits and plants.</v>

541
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.950
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w the one thing that concerns me a with</v>

542
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 3>grass fed meat is that you're eating</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you do.</v>

543
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:28.930
<v Speaker 3>You definitely get a more expensive cut,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're eating an animal that is</v>

544
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:31.220
<v Speaker 3>eating what it's supposed to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

545
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 3>When you're eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've had weigel beef and colby</v>

546
00:22:34.601 --> 00:22:35.620
<v Speaker 3>beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's delicious.</v>

547
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:37.390
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's thing's dead.</v>

548
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 3>That's a dying animal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's like eating a giant fat guy about</v>

549
00:22:40.511 --> 00:22:43.840
<v Speaker 3>to have a heart attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean all that marbling that's not</v>

550
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:47.560
<v Speaker 3>supposed to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you shoot a bison like a free range</v>

551
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:51.130
<v Speaker 3>bison,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get a dark Ruby Red Hong Kong meat.</v>

552
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's all I have to say.</v>

553
00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.800
<v Speaker 3>I completely agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

554
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.570
<v Speaker 3>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there isn't science to really support</v>

555
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.700
<v Speaker 3>that eating a cow that was fed with soy</v>
<v Speaker 3>or corn is necessarily way worse.</v>

556
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.780
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

557
00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.540
<v Speaker 3>I might just be stupid for waiting for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to come out.</v>

558
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 3>It could be worse on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just said that there's way more</v>

559
00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:16.060
<v Speaker 3>omega fatty acids and grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's omega fatty acids are essential</v>

560
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.190
<v Speaker 3>for brain development,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle development.</v>

561
00:23:18.191 --> 00:23:20.410
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there's so many benefits to a sense,</v>

562
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.520
<v Speaker 3>those essential fatty acids and if those</v>
<v Speaker 3>are more present in grass fed meat,</v>

563
00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:27.490
<v Speaker 3>when you just assume that grass fed meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>is more nutritious.</v>

564
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:28.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

565
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.670
<v Speaker 3>I would say that it has more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has moral,</v>

566
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:34.540
<v Speaker 3>meg has more Omega three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might be more nutritious than in that</v>

567
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:38.110
<v Speaker 3>that particular a way that I say like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

568
00:23:38.111 --> 00:23:40.960
<v Speaker 3>is the cost benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The other day I went and bought,</v>

569
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:45.470
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grass fed meat from wholefoods 33 99 a</v>

570
00:23:45.471 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>pound</v>

571
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.610
<v Speaker 2>for a filet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1999 a pound at Costco for a flay.</v>

572
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 2>The Costco one is so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one from whole food was almost not</v>

573
00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:55.370
<v Speaker 2>edible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it did,</v>

574
00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.780
<v Speaker 2>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't taste good.</v>

575
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:01.340
<v Speaker 2>It's real tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tough fillet a at whole foods.</v>

576
00:24:01.341 --> 00:24:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know why they'd have crappy meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason.</v>

577
00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:05.700
<v Speaker 2>Grass fed stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes a little text message.</v>

578
00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.800
<v Speaker 2>You get a sponsorship for Costco right</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you go?</v>

579
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.661
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

580
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:10.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no nails for suspicion.</v>

581
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.220
<v Speaker 2>The ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I'm saying is that,</v>

582
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

583
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:19.210
<v Speaker 2>I've gone to a lot of places is try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find what me I thought tastes the best.</v>

584
00:24:19.401 --> 00:24:20.770
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

585
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.520
<v Speaker 2>so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I have to like,</v>

586
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.590
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat a lot of meat and if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't taste that good,</v>

587
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:30.290
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get through it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I prefer to have meat that tastes</v>

588
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

589
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:35.950
<v Speaker 2>I like 'em for grass fed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to use grass fed beef patties</v>

590
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 2>cause they're a little fattier and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tastes really,</v>

591
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 2>those tastes fine to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

592
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 2>But the grass fed steaks just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't really taste as good.</v>

593
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.870
<v Speaker 2>So I just kind of switched back and</v>
<v Speaker 2>forth.</v>

594
00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.520
<v Speaker 2>I think these are some of the smaller</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

595
00:24:46.521 --> 00:24:48.710
<v Speaker 2>These aren't the main things that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>really trying to fight.</v>

596
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:49.821
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother and I,</v>

597
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:50.654
<v Speaker 2>we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

598
00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.710
<v Speaker 2>took on to do another film and he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

599
00:24:53.711 --> 00:24:57.080
<v Speaker 2>he and I are doing this one together on</v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrition and we're just,</v>

600
00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:00.050
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to find out some truths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're trying to find out about</v>

601
00:25:00.051 --> 00:25:02.180
<v Speaker 2>grass fed and organic and all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

602
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.810
<v Speaker 2>But mainly we're just trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out how the fuck do we help fight</v>

603
00:25:05.811 --> 00:25:08.090
<v Speaker 2>obesity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do we help fight diabetes?</v>

604
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.510
<v Speaker 2>How do we help people gain control of</v>
<v Speaker 2>their diet?</v>

605
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:15.290
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's really truly we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about is control and you look at</v>

606
00:25:15.291 --> 00:25:17.870
<v Speaker 2>it something like a ketogenetic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

607
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.380
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the few diets that can</v>
<v Speaker 2>really help people with control of their</v>

608
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:24.440
<v Speaker 2>diet because it can help break up the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cravings.</v>

609
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.200
<v Speaker 2>And that's really ultimately I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>where our fight is against.</v>

610
00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.620
<v Speaker 2>It's against cravings while these</v>
<v Speaker 2>convenient foods that tastes so fucking</v>

611
00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:32.570
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the credit thing space all the</v>

612
00:25:32.571 --> 00:25:34.820
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fine carbohydrates and sugars a little,</v>

613
00:25:34.821 --> 00:25:36.320
<v Speaker 2>those are giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when,</v>

614
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.860
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hear about saturated fat being</v>

615
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:42.560
<v Speaker 2>dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is dangerous if you take saturated</v>

616
00:25:42.561 --> 00:25:45.860
<v Speaker 2>fat with high levels of carbohydrates</v>
<v Speaker 2>and high levels of refined sugars,</v>

617
00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.110
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doctor Rhonda Patrick went over that in</v>

618
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:51.980
<v Speaker 2>depth and it's really fascinating the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction that your body has to the high</v>

619
00:25:51.981 --> 00:25:53.840
<v Speaker 2>levels of carbohydrates in the high</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of fat.</v>

620
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.410
<v Speaker 2>So your body is either fat burning or</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate burning.</v>

621
00:25:57.411 --> 00:25:59.630
<v Speaker 2>So when you combine the two of them</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

622
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.780
<v Speaker 2>you have a nightmare disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not the saturated fat that's</v>

623
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:07.730
<v Speaker 2>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a saturated fat in conjunction with</v>

624
00:26:07.731 --> 00:26:10.190
<v Speaker 2>the refined carbohydrates and sugars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that they're</v>

625
00:26:10.191 --> 00:26:15.191
<v Speaker 2>finding too is one of the big arguments</v>
<v Speaker 2>that vegans in particular have used for</v>

626
00:26:15.261 --> 00:26:17.720
<v Speaker 2>high carbohydrate diets in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

627
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.650
<v Speaker 2>in relation to obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is look at Asian cultures and Asian</v>

628
00:26:21.651 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 2>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have low levels of obesity,</v>

629
00:26:23.931 --> 00:26:26.750
<v Speaker 2>but high levels of high carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what else?</v>

630
00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:31.751
<v Speaker 2>You have high levels of diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to fat to be diabetic.</v>

631
00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:37.090
<v Speaker 2>How many people in China?</v>
<v Speaker 2>400 million people with diabetes there</v>

632
00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.760
<v Speaker 2>break a record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their level slightly lower than ours.</v>

633
00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in terms of diabetes,</v>

634
00:26:42.831 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>but level</v>

635
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.270
<v Speaker 3>is higher than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty high,</v>

636
00:26:45.271 --> 00:26:45.721
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

637
00:26:45.721 --> 00:26:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Japan's level of diabetes per capita is</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher than ours.</v>

638
00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.970
<v Speaker 3>Their body crazy levels are probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty high too.</v>

639
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:51.631
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

640
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:53.130
<v Speaker 3>Their body fat levels are lower than</v>
<v Speaker 3>ours.</v>

641
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.001
<v Speaker 3>We're gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

642
00:26:54.001 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking at you and I,</v>

643
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:58.590
<v Speaker 3>and not the three of us were not gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Americans were fucking gross.</v>

644
00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

645
00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:04.030
<v Speaker 3>we fucking dog shit and we eat and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>and speaking of dogs,</v>

646
00:27:04.531 --> 00:27:09.531
<v Speaker 3>so we feed our dogs only to like species</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the planet that get fat are human</v>

647
00:27:11.011 --> 00:27:15.600
<v Speaker 3>beings and the things that we feed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my friend's cat is a cat.</v>

648
00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.920
<v Speaker 3>It could be a dog but it's our pets and</v>
<v Speaker 3>people get fat ice cream.</v>

649
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:23.760
<v Speaker 3>You know we grew up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We grew up eating oreo cookies,</v>

650
00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:26.580
<v Speaker 3>having you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a plethora of ice creams and different</v>

651
00:27:26.581 --> 00:27:29.490
<v Speaker 3>things and the inner cabinets or the gym</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do you know,</v>

652
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.500
<v Speaker 3>full on squat workout,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

653
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:34.370
<v Speaker 3>work up to 500 pounds and go home and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat like you know,</v>

654
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 3>half a gallon ice cream.</v>

655
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 3>Just cause we didn't know any better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not even true.</v>

656
00:27:37.351 --> 00:27:40.020
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a full workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just a squat as heavy as we</v>

657
00:27:40.021 --> 00:27:41.150
<v Speaker 3>could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we went home and you know,</v>

658
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:44.920
<v Speaker 3>but there's some benefit for eating some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar post workout.</v>

659
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:45.783
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

660
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:47.910
<v Speaker 3>I know Jim still penny he believes in</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

661
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Like he's into like gummy bears and</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

662
00:27:49.651 --> 00:27:54.450
<v Speaker 3>Like that is a big shift though in</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on in nutrition and what</v>

663
00:27:54.451 --> 00:27:58.410
<v Speaker 3>people think about that co that</v>
<v Speaker 3>postworkout carb window and all that</v>

664
00:27:58.411 --> 00:28:00.390
<v Speaker 3>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of people have been</v>

665
00:28:00.391 --> 00:28:03.210
<v Speaker 3>shifting away from that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people have been shifting away</v>

666
00:28:03.211 --> 00:28:06.330
<v Speaker 3>from six meals a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of them people been shifting away</v>

667
00:28:06.331 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 3>from fasted cardio and a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>dietary like sort of myths that we</v>

668
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.560
<v Speaker 3>thought that we needed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're looking into it and going like,</v>

669
00:28:13.561 --> 00:28:15.360
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't eat after you work out,</v>

670
00:28:15.361 --> 00:28:16.820
<v Speaker 3>you don't lose muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't do that.</v>

671
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these things don't happen.</v>

672
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:21.240
<v Speaker 3>So do you need to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it could be beneficial or it could</v>

673
00:28:21.241 --> 00:28:23.370
<v Speaker 3>not be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're starting to realize that,</v>

674
00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:25.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe some of these things that we were</v>

675
00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:28.170
<v Speaker 3>doing aren't necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's science behind it too</v>

676
00:28:28.171 --> 00:28:30.720
<v Speaker 3>because there's money to be made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I don't think it really matters</v>

677
00:28:30.721 --> 00:28:33.690
<v Speaker 3>exactly when you take in your carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think if you were just to have carbs</v>

678
00:28:33.691 --> 00:28:35.970
<v Speaker 3>throughout the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you would end up with a similar</v>

679
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:38.160
<v Speaker 3>pump and you'd end up with similar</v>
<v Speaker 3>recovery levels.</v>

680
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:40.410
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a lot of studies showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

681
00:28:40.411 --> 00:28:42.670
<v Speaker 3>but there's probably not a study showing</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

682
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.470
<v Speaker 3>if you took in 300 grams of carbs just</v>
<v Speaker 3>normally versus dumping some more in</v>

683
00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:48.420
<v Speaker 3>after workout.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you guys know Rob Wolf,</v>

684
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:49.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

685
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.100
<v Speaker 3>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's great.</v>

686
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.770
<v Speaker 3>But one of the things that Rob Wolf has</v>
<v Speaker 3>done is pretty interesting as he and his</v>

687
00:28:52.771 --> 00:28:56.090
<v Speaker 3>wife will eat the exact same thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then an hour later they tend to the</v>

688
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.320
<v Speaker 3>coast and they have very different</v>
<v Speaker 3>results.</v>

689
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:00.900
<v Speaker 3>And this is something that's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>important to emphasize.</v>

690
00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:04.920
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's body is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And some people just like,</v>

691
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.430
<v Speaker 3>I have one daughter that can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's lactose intolerant.</v>

692
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:09.300
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she drinks milk,</v>

693
00:29:09.301 --> 00:29:11.100
<v Speaker 3>she starts farting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is seven years old.</v>

694
00:29:11.101 --> 00:29:13.290
<v Speaker 3>She thinks it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She thinks it's Hilarious,</v>

695
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.850
<v Speaker 3>but it does hurt her stomach a little</v>
<v Speaker 3>bit and you know,</v>

696
00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:20.100
<v Speaker 3>but she'll have like a little ice cream</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's just start farden and she does</v>

697
00:29:20.101 --> 00:29:21.000
<v Speaker 3>it on q two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

698
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.150
<v Speaker 3>there's something really important to</v>
<v Speaker 3>tell you how she nails you.</v>

699
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.830
<v Speaker 3>She knows like she'd been hanging out</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you guys to hanging out with Quinn.</v>

700
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.620
<v Speaker 3>That's his jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my other daughter and my nine year</v>

701
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:32.610
<v Speaker 3>old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a zero problem with,</v>

702
00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 3>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

703
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:36.330
<v Speaker 3>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just a physiological thing and it's</v>

704
00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:37.230
<v Speaker 3>a weird roll.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The dice.</v>

705
00:29:37.231 --> 00:29:38.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings,</v>

706
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.350
<v Speaker 3>we've very an color.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We vary in height,</v>

707
00:29:40.351 --> 00:29:41.480
<v Speaker 3>we very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in everything we've,</v>

708
00:29:41.481 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>we definitely</v>

709
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.320
<v Speaker 2>very in our dietary needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what makes,</v>

710
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.760
<v Speaker 2>it's so crazy to try to give people a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sort of nutritional advice because,</v>

711
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't talk in generalizations.</v>

712
00:29:51.251 --> 00:29:52.750
<v Speaker 2>He can't say this will work for</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>

713
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:54.790
<v Speaker 2>I can't get on here and say an all meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

714
00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:56.830
<v Speaker 2>I think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll work for everybody.</v>

715
00:29:56.831 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 2>And in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think most people are eating too much</v>

716
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:02.890
<v Speaker 2>sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are fat and a carb period.</v>

717
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

718
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.370
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're trying to define by</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing a documentary.</v>

719
00:30:06.371 --> 00:30:09.370
<v Speaker 2>What are the couple things that we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>point to and say,</v>

720
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.070
<v Speaker 2>everybody needs to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and this.</v>

721
00:30:12.071 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 2>And then these other things are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder if the average American</v>

722
00:30:15.341 --> 00:30:18.420
<v Speaker 2>only 800 carbs every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people wouldn't be fat,</v>

723
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me scratch my hydrate</v>

724
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.150
<v Speaker 2>requirements for athletes though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

725
00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:22.670
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

726
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 2>like my friend Cam Haynes who runs like</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he's training for these ultra</v>

727
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:28.330
<v Speaker 2>marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he runs a fucking marathon a day.</v>

728
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.620
<v Speaker 2>That guy needs more carbs than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>average guy who sits in front of his</v>

729
00:30:32.621 --> 00:30:33.970
<v Speaker 2>desk in his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a can.</v>

730
00:30:33.971 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 2>Here's where carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may be really more fat.</v>

731
00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:37.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they may be you only,</v>

732
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:39.330
<v Speaker 2>you can only store,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

733
00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 2>2000 calories of carbohydrate in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body at one time.</v>

734
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:47.680
<v Speaker 2>But the normal average person has about</v>
<v Speaker 2>40,000 calories of fat just hanging out</v>

735
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:49.090
<v Speaker 2>on their body and they don't even know</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

736
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we have a lot more energy available</v>

737
00:30:51.251 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Speaker 2>to us as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fat.</v>

738
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 2>If we learn how to utilize carbs are</v>
<v Speaker 2>also crucial from one workout to the</v>

739
00:30:57.521 --> 00:30:59.080
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're anybody that ever does</v>

740
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:01.720
<v Speaker 2>multiple workouts in a day of any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>these MMA fighters,</v>

741
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:03.550
<v Speaker 2>crossfitters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing multiple,</v>

742
00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:08.400
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely need carbs and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good opportunity like forget the car</v>

743
00:31:08.401 --> 00:31:11.440
<v Speaker 2>window necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just another opportunity to eat and</v>

744
00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:12.430
<v Speaker 2>to get in some calories.</v>

745
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:15.430
<v Speaker 2>And so I think for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>post workout shakes and those carb</v>

746
00:31:15.431 --> 00:31:18.580
<v Speaker 2>shakes could be really beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem with athletes too because</v>

747
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:22.360
<v Speaker 2>they're always trying to find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>optimum performance and you're</v>

748
00:31:22.361 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 2>experimenting and you're wondering how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of your mind fucking yourself,</v>

749
00:31:25.901 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 2>how much of it is just because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked out too hard?</v>

750
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:31.120
<v Speaker 2>Like where's your energy level at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that you didn't sleep good.</v>

751
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Is that your diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>

752
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:34.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're always trying to figure it</v>

753
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:36.730
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big commitment and a big deal to</v>

754
00:31:36.731 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 2>actually stop what you're doing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to eat because it takes you like</v>

755
00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:44.440
<v Speaker 2>2030 minutes to actually eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might take a 10 20 minutes to cook the</v>

756
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:47.890
<v Speaker 2>meal and then you have 2030 minutes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to digest it.</v>

757
00:31:47.891 --> 00:31:51.880
<v Speaker 2>And you're not sure if you're doing mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have intense workouts or if you're</v>

758
00:31:51.881 --> 00:31:54.400
<v Speaker 2>doing crossfit or some of these workouts</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be really intense.</v>

759
00:31:54.610 --> 00:31:57.160
<v Speaker 2>You're not sure how that's going to sit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sometimes for me,</v>

760
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

761
00:31:58.301 --> 00:31:59.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to use intermittent</v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting,</v>

762
00:31:59.741 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 2>but I don't compete anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me it doesn't matter as much.</v>

763
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fasting,</v>

764
00:32:04.691 --> 00:32:06.720
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the things that we've</v>

765
00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:08.950
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the benefits of the Keto Diet</v>

766
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:12.580
<v Speaker 2>that you also get from intermittent</v>
<v Speaker 2>fasting is when your body goes into fat</v>

767
00:32:12.581 --> 00:32:13.750
<v Speaker 2>burning mode,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

768
00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.970
<v Speaker 2>your hunger goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the weirdest thing.</v>

769
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.160
<v Speaker 2>That's an important thing to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a really poor relationship with</v>

770
00:32:21.161 --> 00:32:24.550
<v Speaker 2>food before I even started the Ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diet.</v>

771
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.300
<v Speaker 2>And by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by doing women too,</v>

772
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.810
<v Speaker 2>let's not talk over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's hard and we're all doing it,</v>

773
00:32:28.811 --> 00:32:30.460
<v Speaker 2>but let's try.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

774
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

775
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.480
<v Speaker 2>not being hungry has allowed me to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit,</v>

776
00:32:35.481 --> 00:32:35.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

777
00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I feel free now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm not,</v>

778
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached food.</v>

779
00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't need</v>

780
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.770
<v Speaker 1>food all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think about food all the time</v>

781
00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:44.240
<v Speaker 1>because I was constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

782
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.090
<v Speaker 1>eating things with sugar in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to the movies and cause I'm</v>

783
00:32:47.091 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 1>a filmmaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love to go to the movies and I used to</v>

784
00:32:49.101 --> 00:32:53.420
<v Speaker 1>go all the time and I had this rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>where during the movie was my only time</v>

785
00:32:53.421 --> 00:32:57.080
<v Speaker 1>I could cheat on my diet and I could eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I wanted and it turned into a</v>

786
00:32:57.081 --> 00:32:58.640
<v Speaker 1>cluster fuck because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have,</v>

787
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have like the little pretzel bites</v>

788
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:04.470
<v Speaker 1>with the cheese that you'd did ben have</v>
<v Speaker 1>sour patch kids and twizzlers and I'd</v>

789
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 1>buy three bags of candy and pretzels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd eat the whole thing during the movie</v>

790
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:12.380
<v Speaker 1>because the movie's usually suck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I need something to do to keep my</v>

791
00:33:12.381 --> 00:33:15.440
<v Speaker 1>mind off of the shitty movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would eat the whole time,</v>

792
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:15.650
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

793
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.870
<v Speaker 1>And obviously that didn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.090
<v Speaker 1>and I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was dieting besides that,</v>

795
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:23.200
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't doing anything because I was</v>

796
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.640
<v Speaker 1>killing all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

797
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.640
<v Speaker 1>all the progress I was making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by doing this Keto genic diet and</v>

798
00:33:28.641 --> 00:33:32.660
<v Speaker 1>not being hungry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's allowed me to just sit back and</v>

799
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 1>look at food and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want that.</v>

800
00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:38.750
<v Speaker 1>And I want that because it's good for me</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than say I need this now because</v>

801
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you still do cheat meals?</v>

802
00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.840
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

803
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 1>once in awhile I shouldn't say no</v>
<v Speaker 1>because then somebody will catch me on</v>

804
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:46.670
<v Speaker 1>instagram with a piece of cake and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

805
00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:50.480
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is I don't,</v>

806
00:33:50.481 --> 00:33:54.560
<v Speaker 1>I try not to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's things that that are</v>

807
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:58.580
<v Speaker 1>cheating for the carnivore diet that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes like come into my life.</v>

808
00:33:58.581 --> 00:34:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody makes a new bar and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it to me and they're like,</v>

809
00:34:01.221 --> 00:34:01.551
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

810
00:34:01.551 --> 00:34:02.390
<v Speaker 1>try this bar.</v>

811
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.100
<v Speaker 1>And I want to just try it to see if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

812
00:34:04.101 --> 00:34:05.870
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's off my diet and I'll eat it.</v>

813
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.080
<v Speaker 1>But my cheats are much less damaging</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they used to be.</v>

814
00:34:09.081 --> 00:34:12.350
<v Speaker 1>My cheats now are what some people call</v>
<v Speaker 1>health foods now.</v>

815
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:15.050
<v Speaker 1>When you say carnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you t you saying that all of your meals</v>

816
00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:16.400
<v Speaker 1>or just meat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

817
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.410
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

818
00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:23.411
<v Speaker 1>just meet just a steak usually or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass fed beef salads,</v>

819
00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:26.890
<v Speaker 1>no salads for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

820
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:29.270
<v Speaker 1>every once in a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm at a restaurant or something</v>

821
00:34:29.271 --> 00:34:31.940
<v Speaker 1>and a salad creeps in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a couple bites of it.</v>

822
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:32.810
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

823
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a vegetable kind of guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never really liked them.</v>

824
00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.390
<v Speaker 1>But I do love fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the sweet stuff,</v>

825
00:34:38.391 --> 00:34:39.980
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like the vegetables that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

826
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:41.420
<v Speaker 1>So how much fruit to you to do now?</v>

827
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.600
<v Speaker 1>About two to three pieces of fruit a</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

828
00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:46.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an apple,</v>

829
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.650
<v Speaker 1>like maybe two apples a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably something like that.</v>

830
00:34:48.651 --> 00:34:50.150
<v Speaker 1>And then how many meals and maybe be</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

831
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:52.250
<v Speaker 1>And then about two meals a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like two,</v>

832
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.820
<v Speaker 1>maybe like two stakes or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe for Burger patties or something</v>

833
00:34:55.821 --> 00:34:58.010
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a whole lot of food that I'm</v>

834
00:34:58.011 --> 00:35:00.530
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't eat like Dr. Sean Baker.</v>

835
00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:03.290
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eats about four pounds of meat a day.</v>

836
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a big giant dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

837
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.391
<v Speaker 1>he's six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

838
00:35:05.391 --> 00:35:08.300
<v Speaker 1>He's a foot taller than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty crazy right there.</v>

839
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:11.270
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a whole lot of food.</v>

840
00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people want to hear all</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet.</v>

841
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 1>They're just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

842
00:35:15.090 --> 00:35:17.930
<v Speaker 1>downing these giant plates of food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not that hungry.</v>

843
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 1>So I try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have to try to hit my protein goal</v>

844
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:23.960
<v Speaker 1>each day though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about,</v>

845
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:26.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need a certain amount of protein,</v>

846
00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:30.020
<v Speaker 1>so I need like 168 grams of protein or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

847
00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 1>I went off the rails the other night at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Peter Luger's in Brooklyn.</v>

848
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I saw that and we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were so excited.</v>

849
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

850
00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.010
<v Speaker 1>But we were eating steak and then I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuffed from the</v>

851
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:39.510
<v Speaker 2>steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but French fries were there.</v>

852
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:40.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

853
00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:45.030
<v Speaker 2>When you eat steak and there's fries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could be stuffed from the steak,</v>

854
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:47.010
<v Speaker 2>but you fucking keep pounding those</v>
<v Speaker 2>fries.</v>

855
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Those salty fries are still God damn</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

856
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Palate fatigue is a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what a professional eaters</v>

857
00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:54.840
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go from like,</v>

858
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.850
<v Speaker 2>they'll be eating ice cream and I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat anymore.</v>

859
00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 2>So they eat some French fries because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different taste salt.</v>

860
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.660
<v Speaker 2>There's something about the side food</v>
<v Speaker 2>with salt.</v>

861
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.570
<v Speaker 2>You could just stuff more in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at like Brian Shaw,</v>

862
00:36:06.571 --> 00:36:08.700
<v Speaker 2>the world's strongest man that we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about before,</v>

863
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.020
<v Speaker 2>he uses a dextrose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He takes like puts it on rice,</v>

864
00:36:13.021 --> 00:36:16.620
<v Speaker 2>which is just sugar and he puts it on</v>
<v Speaker 2>rice so that you can eat more rice.</v>

865
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:18.150
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

866
00:36:18.151 --> 00:36:19.740
<v Speaker 2>Just so he'd get bigger so you can get</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

867
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can maintain it,</v>

868
00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.320
<v Speaker 2>maintain his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

869
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.630
<v Speaker 2>his felt 440 pound body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking,</v>

870
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a totally different thing.</v>

871
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.270
<v Speaker 2>One thing that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that we've tried to do is</v>

872
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:33.180
<v Speaker 2>we've tried to not celebrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

873
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:36.180
<v Speaker 2>I think that can be an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you do want to celebrate here</v>

874
00:36:36.181 --> 00:36:37.560
<v Speaker 2>and there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to have some fun here and</v>

875
00:36:37.561 --> 00:36:40.200
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have control over that celebration.</v>

876
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:42.330
<v Speaker 2>Like you're celebrating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

877
00:36:42.331 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a buddy's birthday party that you</v>

878
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:48.810
<v Speaker 2>never even talked to and you're getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>drunk and eating fucking cheesecake and</v>

879
00:36:48.811 --> 00:36:51.570
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Celebrate when you really want to</v>

880
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:53.400
<v Speaker 2>celebrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you really kind of quote unquote</v>

881
00:36:53.401 --> 00:36:54.740
<v Speaker 2>need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

882
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.300
<v Speaker 2>maybe you celebrate after you lost 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>

883
00:36:57.301 --> 00:36:59.470
<v Speaker 2>But if you celebrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

884
00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.920
<v Speaker 2>by cheating on your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

885
00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:04.950
<v Speaker 2>it's actually like more harmful to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is a real celebration.</v>

886
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:07.860
<v Speaker 2>You're hurting yourself rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>helping improve yourself.</v>

887
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Now we do need to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

888
00:37:09.661 --> 00:37:12.770
<v Speaker 2>we do need times where we do have fun</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we kick back and have a couple of</v>

889
00:37:12.771 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 2>drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but drinking or overeating,</v>

890
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.210
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even when you're trying to stay on your</v>

891
00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:20.310
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will almost always lead to</v>

892
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 2>cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that when,</v>

893
00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:23.180
<v Speaker 2>if I overeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

894
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.850
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

895
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.970
<v Speaker 2>when I get hit with a craving sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so somebody might think,</v>

896
00:37:26.971 --> 00:37:28.260
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to stuff myself with a</v>

897
00:37:28.261 --> 00:37:30.090
<v Speaker 2>bunch of burgers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna stuff myself with a bunch of</v>

898
00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:31.230
<v Speaker 2>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

899
00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:31.921
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>

900
00:37:31.921 --> 00:37:34.680
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't worked that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of makes those cravings creep</v>

901
00:37:34.681 --> 00:37:36.120
<v Speaker 2>back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

902
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:37.110
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

903
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.800
<v Speaker 2>but it's also psychologically it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cheat.</v>

904
00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give yourself a little bit of a break at</v>

905
00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:45.480
<v Speaker 2>some linguine with clams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say even like on a,</v>

906
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.040
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a carnivore diet,</v>

907
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 2>there's some things that I eat.</v>

908
00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I consider them like slight cheats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like going to in and out burger,</v>

909
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting like a flying Dutchman,</v>

910
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is no flying Dutchman is uh,</v>

911
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>patty and then two pieces of cheese and</v>

912
00:37:58.801 --> 00:38:02.190
<v Speaker 2>on a patty that's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it's the cheese because of the</v>

913
00:38:02.191 --> 00:38:03.050
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

914
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:04.040
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

915
00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.910
<v Speaker 2>it's not grass fed or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

916
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:06.480
<v Speaker 2>So you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

917
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.291
<v Speaker 2>So they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

918
00:38:07.291 --> 00:38:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Well what I'm eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least it sort of fits on my,</v>

919
00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:12.180
<v Speaker 2>my plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But those are so good that every once in</v>

920
00:38:12.181 --> 00:38:12.721
<v Speaker 2>a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

921
00:38:12.721 --> 00:38:14.520
<v Speaker 2>he stopped it in and out and get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple,</v>

922
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:16.570
<v Speaker 2>I'd get it with the lettuce on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

923
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:19.290
<v Speaker 2>they give you way too much lettuce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that they can be like an entire</v>

924
00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:20.520
<v Speaker 2>head of lettuce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

925
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:22.530
<v Speaker 2>how do I get through this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like let us,</v>

926
00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.513
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not really.</v>

927
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Not a big fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And neither one of us love salad.</v>

928
00:38:26.491 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 2>I S I said on instagram the other day</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a salad is fake news and people got</v>

929
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:33.060
<v Speaker 2>really pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I meant by that was just that</v>

930
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:35.010
<v Speaker 2>people are dumping tons of dressing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

931
00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're not getting in and getting</v>

932
00:38:37.271 --> 00:38:39.940
<v Speaker 2>what they think they're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially like a lot of salads that</v>

933
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:43.900
<v Speaker 2>you get at like a restaurant or just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not even very green or anything</v>

934
00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 2>that just got full of very teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple dressings like mark sisson</v>

935
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:49.920
<v Speaker 2>makes a dressing that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty good.</v>

936
00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Made with avocado oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

937
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:52.780
<v Speaker 2>Things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

938
00:38:52.781 --> 00:38:55.300
<v Speaker 2>and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I made this dressing because I wanted to</v>

939
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:57.250
<v Speaker 2>be able to dump as much as I want on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

940
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:59.080
<v Speaker 2>And the more I'd dump on the healthier</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets.</v>

941
00:38:59.081 --> 00:39:03.250
<v Speaker 2>And I liked that idea because I eat a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of wild game.</v>

942
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Wild game doesn't have much fat at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I talked about that chipolte lay</v>

943
00:39:07.811 --> 00:39:11.080
<v Speaker 2>mayonnaise and I started eating like</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy after you said it,</v>

944
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I had a ton of it this morning with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>steak.</v>

945
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:15.600
<v Speaker 2>That's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll slice of pizza,</v>

946
00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.150
<v Speaker 2>steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dunkin and put a fucking Glob of</v>

947
00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:21.940
<v Speaker 2>mayonnaise on my plate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll dunk the stake in the mail,</v>

948
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.630
<v Speaker 2>but it's a chipolte lay lime mayo and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's made with avocado oil,</v>

949
00:39:25.631 --> 00:39:27.130
<v Speaker 2>so you're getting all these healthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>fats.</v>

950
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:29.110
<v Speaker 2>It gives you some nice taste,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>

951
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.720
<v Speaker 2>because I'm eating moose and elk and</v>
<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>

952
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.370
<v Speaker 2>it was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very lean meats.</v>

953
00:39:33.371 --> 00:39:37.360
<v Speaker 2>If I'm not eating like a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not even eating beef,</v>

954
00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:42.390
<v Speaker 2>my meat is mostly really wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do a carnivore diet on those</v>

955
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:43.451
<v Speaker 2>kinds of meats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

956
00:39:43.451 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too lean,</v>

957
00:39:44.801 --> 00:39:45.251
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

958
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 2>I would think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to add fat,</v>

959
00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.880
<v Speaker 2>other rabbit starvation.</v>

960
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rabbits are extremely lean and you can</v>

961
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:55.180
<v Speaker 2>eat only rabbit and literally starve to</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

962
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.051
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

963
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:58.360
<v Speaker 2>People have experienced rabbit</v>
<v Speaker 2>starvation.</v>

964
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.510
<v Speaker 2>She sounds crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is crazy because it's so lean.</v>

965
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Google that Google rabbit starvation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what that means,</v>

966
00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:08.590
<v Speaker 2>because someone told me about that and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally never looked into it other</v>

967
00:40:08.591 --> 00:40:11.450
<v Speaker 2>than what they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's so lean that yeah,</v>

968
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.480
<v Speaker 2>your body just doesn't get enough fat</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

969
00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:17.020
<v Speaker 2>butchers typically add fat to a wild</v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

970
00:40:17.021 --> 00:40:19.390
<v Speaker 2>like when they chop it up and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Protein poisoning.</v>

971
00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Protein poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also reserve for it as a rabbit</v>

972
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:25.060
<v Speaker 2>starvation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rare form of acute malnutrition</v>

973
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.610
<v Speaker 2>thought to be caused by a complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>absence of fat,</v>

974
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.510
<v Speaker 2>the Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

975
00:40:28.511 --> 00:40:30.370
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it protein poisoning and</v>

976
00:40:30.371 --> 00:40:31.204
<v Speaker 2>rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

977
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.380
<v Speaker 2>so because if you just eat rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you just have like a fucking</v>

978
00:40:35.381 --> 00:40:36.670
<v Speaker 2>room full rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbit,</v>

979
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:38.600
<v Speaker 2>rabbit me.</v>

980
00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.190
<v Speaker 2>But most people would eat rabbits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat my rabbits with potatoes and you</v>

981
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:46.090
<v Speaker 2>look at that rabbit starvation man</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot live by rabbits alone.</v>

982
00:40:46.091 --> 00:40:49.210
<v Speaker 2>The meat is too lean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Add fats in a few carbs or protein to</v>

983
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:51.040
<v Speaker 2>the lap end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's what a rabbit is.</v>

984
00:40:51.041 --> 00:40:54.550
<v Speaker 2>And you can easily survive rabbit meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lapin is typically to lean.</v>

985
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

986
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:58.720
<v Speaker 2>Leaner than chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

987
00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:59.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

988
00:40:59.861 --> 00:41:01.780
<v Speaker 2>Well those little fuckers are just</v>
<v Speaker 2>running all the time.</v>

989
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.061
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

990
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 2>How to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a ketogenic diet,</v>

991
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:08.530
<v Speaker 2>I was up around 200 grams of protein</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I first started it.</v>

992
00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.330
<v Speaker 2>That was just dropping fat like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just drop me.</v>

993
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.220
<v Speaker 2>That's not a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 grams of protein fat.</v>

994
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh fat is 20 grams of fat and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>dropping,</v>

995
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 2>I said protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 grams of fat and I was just dropping</v>

996
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:23.620
<v Speaker 2>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

997
00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:24.580
<v Speaker 2>like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

998
00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.380
<v Speaker 2>But then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it came to a point where it</v>

999
00:41:26.381 --> 00:41:28.870
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what everybody needs to</v>

1000
00:41:28.871 --> 00:41:33.350
<v Speaker 2>know is a and I on any of these diets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they eventually plateau or stop and then</v>

1001
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>you have to sort of</v>

1002
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.190
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get around that</v>
<v Speaker 1>roadblock and continue to like lose more</v>

1003
00:41:37.191 --> 00:41:38.510
<v Speaker 1>weight or do whatever you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

1004
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people just too much protein knocks</v>

1005
00:41:40.671 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 1>you out of ketosis because your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes too much protein in reverts it to</v>

1006
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:44.684
<v Speaker 1>glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1007
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's overstated a lot though.</v>

1008
00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like if you have a couple of</v>

1009
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:52.610
<v Speaker 1>grams over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be in trouble.</v>

1010
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.970
<v Speaker 1>But if you're getting 500 grams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein or something crazy or even like</v>

1011
00:41:55.971 --> 00:41:57.300
<v Speaker 1>300 grams of protein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1012
00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:59.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a while you're going to get to too</v>

1013
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 1>much and you're gonna have that problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like for most people,</v>

1014
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:04.770
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to be the main issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1015
00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.020
<v Speaker 2>For me it's inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Inflammation is,</v>

1016
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:10.540
<v Speaker 2>the big difference is when I eat a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of carbs,</v>

1017
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.800
<v Speaker 2>if I go off the rails and I'll cheat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>have pasta or bread or something like</v>

1018
00:42:14.801 --> 00:42:16.810
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I experienced more inflammation.</v>

1019
00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.030
<v Speaker 2>It's appearance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more soreness in my joints.</v>

1020
00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:19.810
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

1021
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get more fatigued.</v>

1022
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:22.350
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1023
00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:24.970
<v Speaker 2>like tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get that insulin crash,</v>

1024
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:28.030
<v Speaker 2>you get all those big factors that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

1025
00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:33.090
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get when I eat clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I eat just meat and salad and</v>

1026
00:42:33.311 --> 00:42:36.400
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and high fat diet and low</v>
<v Speaker 2>carb,</v>

1027
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:38.640
<v Speaker 2>my body is just way more efficient and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1028
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.770
<v Speaker 2>it feels better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the big thing that I keep trying to</v>

1029
00:42:41.771 --> 00:42:44.170
<v Speaker 2>stress to people is you don't need a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nap.</v>

1030
00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.470
<v Speaker 2>That fucking afternoon nap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I just thought it's something you</v>

1031
00:42:47.471 --> 00:42:50.770
<v Speaker 2>need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that is is just your body recovering</v>

1032
00:42:50.771 --> 00:42:52.150
<v Speaker 2>from lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>FM carbs.</v>

1033
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're fucking carbs at lunch if you</v>

1034
00:42:53.981 --> 00:42:57.010
<v Speaker 2>don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the day is much more efficient.</v>

1035
00:42:57.011 --> 00:42:59.650
<v Speaker 2>I get more done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have more energy and I was like,</v>

1036
00:42:59.651 --> 00:43:01.570
<v Speaker 2>when people say how do you do like all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these podcasts,</v>

1037
00:43:01.571 --> 00:43:03.370
<v Speaker 2>two podcasts a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like no,</v>

1038
00:43:03.371 --> 00:43:04.870
<v Speaker 2>I eat good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat good.</v>

1039
00:43:04.871 --> 00:43:06.400
<v Speaker 2>And it's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard.</v>

1040
00:43:06.401 --> 00:43:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is functioning all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

1041
00:43:09.161 --> 00:43:14.161
<v Speaker 2>if I stopped at noon and had a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>pizza and then try to do a podcast,</v>

1042
00:43:14.381 --> 00:43:15.430
<v Speaker 2>I'd be here like going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1043
00:43:15.431 --> 00:43:17.050
<v Speaker 2>is this done yet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to sleep.</v>

1044
00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.340
<v Speaker 2>They just get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1045
00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.220
<v Speaker 2>you get exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing this diet since the mid</v>

1046
00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:25.030
<v Speaker 2>ninety's since like 1993 I think it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the time we kind of started.</v>

1047
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:28.600
<v Speaker 2>We've been doing them on and off for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time and more recently I used it to</v>

1048
00:43:28.601 --> 00:43:32.020
<v Speaker 2>drop 70 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think one of the,</v>

1049
00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:35.920
<v Speaker 2>one of the things with Kido that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>noticed was it almost doesn't really</v>

1050
00:43:35.921 --> 00:43:38.140
<v Speaker 2>matter that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean ketosis all the time.</v>

1051
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.110
<v Speaker 2>I think the effort to be in Ketosis I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is important,</v>

1052
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:42.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by getting rid of a lot of the</v>

1053
00:43:42.791 --> 00:43:46.630
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates that you have the effort</v>
<v Speaker 2>to kind of eat a little bit more fat.</v>

1054
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:51.160
<v Speaker 2>But what I've noticed is I don't think I</v>
<v Speaker 2>need to really go out of my way to eat</v>

1055
00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.320
<v Speaker 2>tons and tons of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to be dumping tons of MCT</v>

1056
00:43:53.321 --> 00:43:54.790
<v Speaker 2>oil and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to,</v>

1057
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:55.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1058
00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.030
<v Speaker 2>there's enough fat usually in the stakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I'm eating.</v>

1059
00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:00.310
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times I get ribeye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1060
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.290
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I eat bacon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a eggs,</v>

1061
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:04.960
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put up on my instagram the other day</v>

1062
00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:08.470
<v Speaker 2>about seven or eight foods that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought if you just stuck to these seven</v>

1063
00:44:08.471 --> 00:44:11.590
<v Speaker 2>or eight foods for a handful of days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would lose a lot of weight.</v>

1064
00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:15.270
<v Speaker 2>And the response was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were writing back and you're</v>

1065
00:44:15.271 --> 00:44:15.881
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

1066
00:44:15.881 --> 00:44:17.290
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had lost 10 pounds and well,</v>

1067
00:44:17.291 --> 00:44:18.970
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people do lose weight off</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quito.</v>

1068
00:44:18.971 --> 00:44:21.520
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But even mark Sisson,</v>

1069
00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:26.400
<v Speaker 2>who was one that got me into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark goes on and off and he thinks that</v>

1070
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:28.210
<v Speaker 2>there's some benefit to going on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1071
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he has to be in Ketosis.</v>

1072
00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.450
<v Speaker 2>Ketogenetic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 2>But even when</v>

1074
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.130
<v Speaker 3>you go off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not switching your diet to</v>

1075
00:44:35.131 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 3>spaghetti.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1076
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:37.470
<v Speaker 3>you're not eating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1077
00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.280
<v Speaker 3>fucking wonder bread or shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's love it.</v>

1078
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:41.550
<v Speaker 3>If you switched up spaghetti,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1079
00:44:41.551 --> 00:44:42.690
<v Speaker 3>That's your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pasta.</v>

1080
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:43.620
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it.</v>

1081
00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I like it when I cheat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't like the effect on my body</v>

1082
00:44:46.531 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just liked the taste of it.</v>

1083
00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Like linguine with clams is one of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite things to eat,</v>

1084
00:44:50.761 --> 00:44:54.870
<v Speaker 3>but the way I feel afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not my favorite bread and butter.</v>

1085
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:55.763
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So?</v>

1086
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Why is that so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

1087
00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:57.991
<v Speaker 3>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1088
00:44:57.991 --> 00:44:59.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people are out in county.</v>

1089
00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.080
<v Speaker 3>They don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We always talk about this.</v>

1090
00:45:01.081 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 3>Hard roles used to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1091
00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.330
<v Speaker 3>like a buttered roll in the morning and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we grew up in New York,</v>

1092
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.940
<v Speaker 3>buttered roll with butter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the best thing ever.</v>

1093
00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.500
<v Speaker 3>And out here they don't have him.</v>

1094
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.300
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually glad they don't have now</v>

1095
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.290
<v Speaker 3>you know and I've had that I fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>love sour dough bread with grass fed</v>

1096
00:45:16.291 --> 00:45:18.830
<v Speaker 3>butter and honey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>

1097
00:45:18.831 --> 00:45:21.150
<v Speaker 3>they had sourdough salad is really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What honey?</v>

1098
00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:22.420
<v Speaker 3>On top of the butter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1099
00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:28.740
<v Speaker 3>oh all this keto genic sounds amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When all this stuff going on.</v>

1100
00:45:28.771 --> 00:45:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I had been wondering when somebody is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to make some bread,</v>

1101
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.350
<v Speaker 3>like figuring out a terrible though it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that bad.</v>

1102
00:45:34.351 --> 00:45:36.120
<v Speaker 3>No foods is good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like their bread.</v>

1103
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.620
<v Speaker 3>I make egg sandwiches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no fruits.</v>

1104
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:41.190
<v Speaker 3>I haven't tried out w I haven't tried to</v>
<v Speaker 3>make a lot of good stuff.</v>

1105
00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.610
<v Speaker 3>I know they just came out the waffles</v>
<v Speaker 3>that good,</v>

1106
00:45:44.611 --> 00:45:47.400
<v Speaker 3>that donuts and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think a lot of those things for</v>

1107
00:45:47.401 --> 00:45:49.740
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have way too many carbohydrates for</v>

1108
00:45:49.741 --> 00:45:50.940
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Way Too many.</v>

1109
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 3>But I think isn't there something about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the type of carbs they have fibers in</v>

1110
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:55.500
<v Speaker 3>them?</v>

1111
00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:59.900
<v Speaker 3>Usually they don't raise your blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>level bludge something like that.</v>

1112
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I,</v>

1113
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to eat regular waffles on a</v>

1114
00:46:03.331 --> 00:46:06.420
<v Speaker 3>regular basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if I'm going to cheat and I eat what</v>

1115
00:46:06.421 --> 00:46:07.450
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1116
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:12.490
<v Speaker 3>and they also have a very low sugar</v>
<v Speaker 3>syrup to it tastes very good with some</v>

1117
00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:14.490
<v Speaker 3>butter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>

1118
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.270
<v Speaker 3>it's the best option if you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do something like that.</v>

1119
00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.700
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should mostly eat real foods.</v>

1120
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:24.600
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel better when I eat meat and</v>
<v Speaker 3>vegetables.</v>

1121
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:25.590
<v Speaker 3>That's when I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm,</v>

1122
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had Jordan Peterson on and he had some</v>

1123
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:32.340
<v Speaker 3>pretty serious autoimmune disorders and</v>
<v Speaker 3>his body was really in trouble and his</v>

1124
00:46:32.341 --> 00:46:36.960
<v Speaker 3>daughter had similar problems and his</v>
<v Speaker 3>daughter went to essentially a diet of</v>

1125
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 3>just meat and Greens and now I think</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's not a carnivore diet and she's got</v>

1126
00:46:41.791 --> 00:46:43.560
<v Speaker 3>a instagram page to documenting it.</v>

1127
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.910
<v Speaker 3>But he went to meet and Greens lost a</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit ton of weight.</v>

1128
00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.760
<v Speaker 3>Let was losing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he said he's losing,</v>

1129
00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:52.200
<v Speaker 3>what did he say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like seven pounds a month for something</v>

1130
00:46:52.201 --> 00:46:56.790
<v Speaker 3>like something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lots of ton of weight and looks great.</v>

1131
00:46:56.791 --> 00:46:59.040
<v Speaker 3>He said he's thinner than he's been at</v>
<v Speaker 3>25 years.</v>

1132
00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 3>It feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All is autoimmune issues.</v>

1133
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:03.840
<v Speaker 3>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of what people are dealing</v>

1134
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:08.130
<v Speaker 3>with is inflammation that's caused by</v>
<v Speaker 3>too much processed carbohydrates,</v>

1135
00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:12.540
<v Speaker 3>too much simple refined carbohydrates</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sugars and the inflammation leads to</v>

1136
00:47:12.541 --> 00:47:15.210
<v Speaker 3>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you look at what they call the</v>

1137
00:47:15.211 --> 00:47:18.990
<v Speaker 3>five scourges of health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are a obesity,</v>

1138
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.090
<v Speaker 3>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cognitive decline,</v>

1139
00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:23.850
<v Speaker 3>heart disease and diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are all metabolic.</v>

1140
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:27.960
<v Speaker 3>Those are all things that we get through</v>
<v Speaker 3>food and over half the people that are</v>

1141
00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 3>in the hospital today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now</v>

1142
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:33.010
<v Speaker 4>in the United States are in there for</v>
<v Speaker 4>metabolic issues.</v>

1143
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:34.900
<v Speaker 4>So that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

1144
00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.420
<v Speaker 4>Most of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so more than half of the people that are</v>

1145
00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:39.310
<v Speaker 4>in the hospital are there because of</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they ate.</v>

1146
00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.040
<v Speaker 4>It is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you see a direct correlation</v>

1147
00:47:42.041 --> 00:47:44.830
<v Speaker 4>between the amount of refined sugars and</v>
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates.</v>

1148
00:47:45.010 --> 00:47:49.510
<v Speaker 4>Human beings have adjusted and started</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating to the rise in diabetes and heart</v>

1149
00:47:49.511 --> 00:47:52.210
<v Speaker 4>disease and all these other issues.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know the,</v>

1150
00:47:52.211 --> 00:47:54.340
<v Speaker 4>one of the things we were talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>before the podcast is,</v>

1151
00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.470
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went running today.</v>

1152
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 4>If for some reason I can't stop</v>
<v Speaker 4>coughing,</v>

1153
00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:03.570
<v Speaker 4>people are dealing with a lot of various</v>
<v Speaker 4>health issues and they're always trying</v>

1154
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:10.390
<v Speaker 4>to pin like one cause of these health</v>
<v Speaker 4>issues.</v>

1155
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 4>And one of the real problems is when</v>
<v Speaker 4>people develop these ideological</v>

1156
00:48:14.921 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 4>answers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like veganism is one of them.</v>

1157
00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:21.520
<v Speaker 4>They do not want to thank that there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything healthy about meat and that</v>

1158
00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:24.570
<v Speaker 4>what they do is the only way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is the way,</v>

1159
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.980
<v Speaker 4>and like I'm watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a thread right now going on on</v>

1160
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:29.350
<v Speaker 4>twitter between some cockamamie Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 4>doctor.</v>

1161
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:33.700
<v Speaker 4>He's full of Shit and all these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are s citing science and and he is</v>

1162
00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:36.850
<v Speaker 4>getting pissed off and he's showing his</v>
<v Speaker 4>degree and photos of his degree.</v>

1163
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:37.930
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look motherfucker,</v>

1164
00:48:37.931 --> 00:48:42.160
<v Speaker 4>this is real science to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 4>dietary cholesterol is necessary.</v>

1165
00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.880
<v Speaker 4>It's the building blocks for cells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it literally is.</v>

1166
00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:46.870
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1167
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:51.730
<v Speaker 4>it's the reason why your body is</v>
<v Speaker 4>converting it to,</v>

1168
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.910
<v Speaker 4>to all the sex hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cholesterol,</v>

1169
00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.210
<v Speaker 4>saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body processes that it's healthy</v>

1170
00:48:58.211 --> 00:48:59.980
<v Speaker 4>for your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's healthy for your heart.</v>

1171
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:03.820
<v Speaker 4>All these things are a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not recognizing the fact that their</v>

1172
00:49:03.821 --> 00:49:08.560
<v Speaker 4>issue is not saturated fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's saturated fat in conjunction with</v>

1173
00:49:08.561 --> 00:49:10.810
<v Speaker 4>all these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's a problem with these studies.</v>

1174
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:15.070
<v Speaker 4>Like one of the studies they did</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently where they showed that people</v>

1175
00:49:15.071 --> 00:49:17.080
<v Speaker 4>who ate meat more than five times a</v>
<v Speaker 4>week,</v>

1176
00:49:17.081 --> 00:49:18.670
<v Speaker 4>we're much more likely to have heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease.</v>

1177
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.250
<v Speaker 4>But that's not a good study because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't say,</v>

1178
00:49:21.251 --> 00:49:23.800
<v Speaker 4>what are they eating the meat with?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you eating?</v>

1179
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:27.630
<v Speaker 4>Are you eating it with Brett?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you eating it in a,</v>

1180
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:29.770
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the same as a burger?</v>

1181
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.360
<v Speaker 4>Are you drinking a soda with it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1182
00:49:31.361 --> 00:49:35.740
<v Speaker 4>Like this is not a good study.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A good study would be have someone you</v>

1183
00:49:35.741 --> 00:49:37.360
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a large group of people,</v>

1184
00:49:37.361 --> 00:49:39.700
<v Speaker 4>put them on a carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a large group of people put 'em on</v>

1185
00:49:39.701 --> 00:49:41.380
<v Speaker 4>a Keto Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a large group of people,</v>

1186
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:45.820
<v Speaker 4>put it on a standard American diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let 'em eat burgers and fries and</v>

1187
00:49:45.821 --> 00:49:47.470
<v Speaker 4>chocolate shakes and sodas and let's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's,</v>

1188
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.170
<v Speaker 4>let's find out what the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Put people on a Vegan Diet.</v>

1189
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:54.070
<v Speaker 4>I have had tons of friends,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including Sam Harris who was on a Vegan</v>

1190
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:56.560
<v Speaker 4>diet and his fucking blood sugar was off</v>
<v Speaker 4>the charts.</v>

1191
00:49:56.561 --> 00:49:57.040
<v Speaker 4>He had to try.</v>

1192
00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.960
<v Speaker 4>It was trying to figure out how to stay</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy.</v>

1193
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.690
<v Speaker 4>Like he tried,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he tried it for a long time,</v>

1194
00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:04.750
<v Speaker 4>but he felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he went and switched to fish</v>

1195
00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.090
<v Speaker 4>and he felt like shit just doing that</v>
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>

1196
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:10.210
<v Speaker 4>And then he went back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now he's helping to answer the answer</v>

1197
00:50:10.211 --> 00:50:13.090
<v Speaker 4>always seems to come back to being in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the middle somewhere,</v>

1198
00:50:13.091 --> 00:50:15.910
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like somewhere we veer off so far and</v>

1199
00:50:15.911 --> 00:50:16.571
<v Speaker 4>we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh man,</v>

1200
00:50:16.571 --> 00:50:21.040
<v Speaker 4>we got to retos and we got cookies and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we got all this stuff being thrown at us</v>

1201
00:50:21.041 --> 00:50:24.310
<v Speaker 4>every single day and it's convenient.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then someone will say,</v>

1202
00:50:24.311 --> 00:50:26.500
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know more carbs and you just</v>

1203
00:50:26.501 --> 00:50:27.860
<v Speaker 4>go the complete route</v>

1204
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.380
<v Speaker 2>and you end up with something like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>carnivore diet.</v>

1205
00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:33.860
<v Speaker 2>But I think just if you're just sit</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and think about stuff logically,</v>

1206
00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.530
<v Speaker 2>it would make sense to me that you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>overdo it on me.</v>

1207
00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.450
<v Speaker 2>Like I think you can overdo it on just</v>
<v Speaker 2>about anything.</v>

1208
00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:39.050
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1209
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:42.920
<v Speaker 2>that's why I lean towards balance and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I like vegetables,</v>

1210
00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:44.380
<v Speaker 2>but I can't talk you guys into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1211
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I think your balance is probably a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably ideal,</v>

1212
00:50:47.151 --> 00:50:48.140
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1213
00:50:48.141 --> 00:50:51.440
<v Speaker 2>the balance of the average American's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not great because I think they think</v>

1214
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:53.540
<v Speaker 2>they can just grab and reach for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

1215
00:50:53.541 --> 00:50:55.090
<v Speaker 2>That's their level of balance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1216
00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.650
<v Speaker 2>I think the average American is just</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to feed themselves.</v>

1217
00:50:57.700 --> 00:50:58.550
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to,</v>

1218
00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.220
<v Speaker 2>they're hungry and they're tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>

1219
00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a great top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1220
00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Henry thoreau quote that most men live</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives of quiet desperation.</v>

1221
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.400
<v Speaker 2>And I think that applies to so many</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

1222
00:51:10.401 --> 00:51:13.970
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are fucking working all day</v>

1223
00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:16.910
<v Speaker 2>and they're sad and they feel like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when you get out of there,</v>

1224
00:51:16.911 --> 00:51:18.710
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Wendy's drive through.</v>

1225
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:21.890
<v Speaker 2>Come on baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hit me up with one of them fucking</v>

1226
00:51:21.891 --> 00:51:23.810
<v Speaker 2>double cheeseburgers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chocolate shake,</v>

1227
00:51:23.811 --> 00:51:24.790
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>

1228
00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.880
<v Speaker 2>They get a little reward and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they feel even more shitty and</v>

1229
00:51:28.881 --> 00:51:31.430
<v Speaker 2>then they crash and they get up and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it all over again with a fucking egg</v>

1230
00:51:31.431 --> 00:51:34.550
<v Speaker 2>mcmuffin and a cup of coffee with three</v>
<v Speaker 2>scoops of sugar in it.</v>

1231
00:51:34.551 --> 00:51:37.010
<v Speaker 2>And this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the rollercoaster that most</v>

1232
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:39.320
<v Speaker 2>people are on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it all started with them going to</v>

1233
00:51:39.321 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 2>bed too late because they stayed around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and fuck around on their phone or watch</v>

1234
00:51:43.161 --> 00:51:45.230
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to bed too late.</v>

1235
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:48.260
<v Speaker 2>They woke up later than they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're tired because they didn't get to</v>

1236
00:51:48.261 --> 00:51:50.270
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were supposed to get drank the</v>

1237
00:51:50.271 --> 00:51:51.081
<v Speaker 2>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1238
00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 2>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's this one thing snowballing after</v>

1239
00:51:54.471 --> 00:51:55.700
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what are you guys doing in this</v>

1240
00:51:55.701 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 2>documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you trying to document?</v>

1241
00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:02.300
<v Speaker 2>We're basically just going around</v>
<v Speaker 2>interviewing people that are sort of in</v>

1242
00:52:02.301 --> 00:52:03.020
<v Speaker 2>the know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1243
00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.070
<v Speaker 2>that are writing these books like Mark</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sisson,</v>

1244
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:06.890
<v Speaker 2>Robb Wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are some of the people that we</v>

1245
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.080
<v Speaker 2>interviewed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just asking them,</v>

1246
00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic questions about diet and nutrition</v>

1247
00:52:11.931 --> 00:52:13.800
<v Speaker 2>and sort of seeing what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1248
00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.890
<v Speaker 2>where they stand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1249
00:52:15.891 --> 00:52:16.581
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1250
00:52:16.581 --> 00:52:19.520
<v Speaker 2>we SORTA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shot about 15 interviews right now</v>

1251
00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:22.040
<v Speaker 2>and then it's my job to sort of figure</v>
<v Speaker 2>out like,</v>

1252
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.080
<v Speaker 2>well how does this all correlate</v>
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>

1253
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:25.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we,</v>

1254
00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.760
<v Speaker 2>we don't really have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say it'd be disingenuous for me to</v>

1255
00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:31.220
<v Speaker 2>come on and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is exactly what we're going to do</v>

1256
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.690
<v Speaker 2>because I have no idea what it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

1257
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:34.970
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the beauty of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we shot bigger,</v>

1258
00:52:34.971 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster,</v>

1259
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.300
<v Speaker 2>I had no clue how that was going to turn</v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1260
00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:40.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think a lot of documentary</v>
<v Speaker 2>filmmakers,</v>

1261
00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:42.980
<v Speaker 2>they'd go in with like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the point I'm going to prove,</v>

1262
00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:44.720
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me find all the people and string</v>

1263
00:52:44.721 --> 00:52:47.420
<v Speaker 2>them along and then figuring out how</v>
<v Speaker 2>they fit into the puzzle.</v>

1264
00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:49.430
<v Speaker 2>And if they don't conveniently fit in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>my puzzle,</v>

1265
00:52:49.431 --> 00:52:51.710
<v Speaker 2>they're out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>

1266
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:52.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1267
00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.660
<v Speaker 2>I developed a different way of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like to try to get as much</v>

1268
00:52:56.661 --> 00:53:00.020
<v Speaker 2>information as I can and then think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it a lot and then put it in a way</v>

1269
00:53:00.021 --> 00:53:03.590
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're basically doing the opposite</v>

1270
00:53:03.591 --> 00:53:06.490
<v Speaker 2>of a lot of these propaganda films.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is one of the problems that,</v>

1271
00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.950
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of people that have had heart</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease or all these various issues,</v>

1272
00:53:09.951 --> 00:53:13.490
<v Speaker 2>they paid attention to some of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>propaganda films.</v>

1273
00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:16.370
<v Speaker 2>So there's a couple of Vegan ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are out there right now.</v>

1274
00:53:16.371 --> 00:53:21.371
<v Speaker 2>What the health that's been widely</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissed by scientists and the</v>

1275
00:53:22.471 --> 00:53:25.680
<v Speaker 2>integration experts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would love to interview him or any</v>

1276
00:53:25.681 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 2>of the doctors</v>

1277
00:53:26.250 --> 00:53:28.410
<v Speaker 1>that are involved in that because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1278
00:53:28.411 --> 00:53:30.180
<v Speaker 1>why not let them see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them,</v>

1279
00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:35.040
<v Speaker 1>let them speak their mind and let's hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they have to say and then let's</v>

1280
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.630
<v Speaker 1>talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1281
00:53:36.631 --> 00:53:39.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another interesting thing because</v>

1282
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:42.210
<v Speaker 1>the other thing I also feel is like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy that made what?</v>

1283
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:45.540
<v Speaker 1>The health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like he has good intentions</v>

1284
00:53:45.541 --> 00:53:46.400
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1285
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's not trying to like kill</v>

1286
00:53:48.851 --> 00:53:49.860
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill people.</v>

1287
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:53.010
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to help people just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to help people.</v>

1288
00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:57.510
<v Speaker 1>So he's over here going like this guy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to help people eat and meet.</v>

1289
00:53:57.511 --> 00:54:00.030
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is I'm not doing that to</v>

1290
00:54:00.031 --> 00:54:02.250
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like there is a lot of benefits</v>

1291
00:54:02.251 --> 00:54:04.290
<v Speaker 1>to a Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people that could</v>

1292
00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:06.630
<v Speaker 1>benefit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can everybody benefit from it?</v>

1293
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things missing also.</v>

1294
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:11.160
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely questioned it,</v>

1295
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:14.550
<v Speaker 1>but I don't shit all over it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the way to help</v>

1296
00:54:14.551 --> 00:54:17.820
<v Speaker 1>people that way to help people as a sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bring them together and figure out</v>

1297
00:54:17.821 --> 00:54:18.530
<v Speaker 1>what</v>

1298
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:19.730
<v Speaker 4>rare that people do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1299
00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:21.860
<v Speaker 4>And I think if you do it right and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

1300
00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:22.790
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1301
00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.060
<v Speaker 4>some sort of b12 12 supplements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it is a,</v>

1302
00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:26.811
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from,</v>

1303
00:54:26.811 --> 00:54:27.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1304
00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Greens,</v>

1305
00:54:29.061 --> 00:54:29.894
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1306
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:31.340
<v Speaker 4>what do they use a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

1307
00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.920
<v Speaker 4>what's that</v>
<v Speaker 4>algae,</v>

1308
00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.060
<v Speaker 4>Maria?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The algae stuff.</v>

1309
00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:37.150
<v Speaker 4>There's dominic d'agostino uses right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1310
00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.540
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of that stuff that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>

1311
00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:42.110
<v Speaker 4>you can get your b vitamins from and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if they're not opposed,</v>

1312
00:54:42.111 --> 00:54:43.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1313
00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:45.800
<v Speaker 4>some of the simplest organisms on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>planet are mollusks,</v>

1314
00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:48.410
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I know that people think of them as</v>

1315
00:54:48.411 --> 00:54:51.050
<v Speaker 4>animal life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're more primitive than plants.</v>

1316
00:54:51.350 --> 00:54:54.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's certain clams and Molec seen</v>

1317
00:54:54.051 --> 00:54:56.720
<v Speaker 4>things like they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't feel fucking shit.</v>

1318
00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.110
<v Speaker 4>They're not suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They literally don't have the capacity</v>

1319
00:55:00.111 --> 00:55:02.270
<v Speaker 4>for pain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they're one of the more primitive</v>

1320
00:55:02.271 --> 00:55:03.170
<v Speaker 4>life forms on earth.</v>

1321
00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:05.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we deviated from them 600 million years</v>

1322
00:55:05.451 --> 00:55:08.150
<v Speaker 4>ago or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're barely an animal.</v>

1323
00:55:08.151 --> 00:55:10.070
<v Speaker 4>We can call them an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are some.</v>

1324
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:13.190
<v Speaker 4>But see what we say is because they</v>
<v Speaker 4>move,</v>

1325
00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:15.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the clam closes its mouth.</v>

1326
00:55:15.861 --> 00:55:17.570
<v Speaker 4>We've decided that that's a living</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

1327
00:55:17.650 --> 00:55:18.770
<v Speaker 4>It's move to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1328
00:55:18.771 --> 00:55:21.310
<v Speaker 4>do you have to plant that aids the rats?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1329
00:55:21.311 --> 00:55:22.340
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing's awesome.</v>

1330
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:24.090
<v Speaker 4>Or Venus fly traps.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1331
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.020
<v Speaker 4>And the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>plants are far more complex and their</v>

1332
00:55:27.021 --> 00:55:30.290
<v Speaker 4>ability to communicate and their ability</v>
<v Speaker 4>to even express predation,</v>

1333
00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:34.310
<v Speaker 4>pain and protect themselves through</v>
<v Speaker 4>various chemical,</v>

1334
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>means to protect themselves from</v>

1335
00:55:36.321 --> 00:55:39.080
<v Speaker 4>predation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They changed the way they taste to keep</v>

1336
00:55:39.081 --> 00:55:42.110
<v Speaker 4>from getting eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's been studies also that you</v>

1337
00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:46.190
<v Speaker 4>just play the sound of a caterpillar</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating leaves next to plants.</v>

1338
00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.850
<v Speaker 4>They recognize that sound and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed their taste profile,</v>

1339
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 4>which is just fucked.</v>

1340
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those are,</v>

1341
00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:55.540
<v Speaker 1>those are chemicals like Lectins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like lectins and stuff that,</v>

1342
00:55:55.541 --> 00:55:57.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be very damaging to people.</v>

1343
00:55:57.491 --> 00:55:58.690
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he,</v>

1344
00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:00.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cucumbers and tomatoes and stuff like</v>

1345
00:56:00.701 --> 00:56:02.230
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're getting a lot of these lectins</v>

1346
00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:06.190
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of people are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have adverse reactions to.</v>

1347
00:56:06.191 --> 00:56:08.950
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of people be eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1348
00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:12.400
<v Speaker 1>a variety of vegetables in our diet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not understand why they still don't feel</v>

1349
00:56:12.401 --> 00:56:13.240
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1350
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.430
<v Speaker 1>they need to look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have a lectin issue,</v>

1351
00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:15.730
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1352
00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:16.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1353
00:56:16.191 --> 00:56:18.920
<v Speaker 4>it's entirely possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of people,</v>

1354
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:20.410
<v Speaker 4>let me start it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This film,</v>

1355
00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were going to call it the war on</v>

1356
00:56:22.061 --> 00:56:23.260
<v Speaker 4>carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what were,</v>

1357
00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 4>that's what we were talking</v>

1358
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:24.903
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1359
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.970
<v Speaker 2>that's what we've been talking about for</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a long time.</v>

1360
00:56:27.971 --> 00:56:29.950
<v Speaker 2>But as we started to go through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

1361
00:56:29.951 --> 00:56:30.521
<v Speaker 2>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1362
00:56:30.521 --> 00:56:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>war on carbs.</v>

1363
00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe that's going to isolate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's gonna a pigeon holed a movie</v>

1364
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:38.590
<v Speaker 2>into one style.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as we started interviewing more and</v>

1365
00:56:38.591 --> 00:56:41.350
<v Speaker 2>more people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we realized that the problem is carbs.</v>

1366
00:56:41.790 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a war on refined carbs and vegetables,</v>

1367
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:47.350
<v Speaker 2>oils and sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1368
00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:48.360
<v Speaker 2>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a refined,</v>

1369
00:56:48.361 --> 00:56:49.840
<v Speaker 2>you say cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about pizza,</v>

1370
00:56:49.841 --> 00:56:53.250
<v Speaker 2>basically an ice cream and all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the excess things that people are</v>

1371
00:56:53.251 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 2>using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not really tough oils,</v>

1372
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:57.100
<v Speaker 2>refined carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refined sugars,</v>

1373
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:59.080
<v Speaker 2>and these are all product to the modern</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

1374
00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:03.460
<v Speaker 2>modern industrialized world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they call it production western.</v>

1375
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:04.690
<v Speaker 2>They call the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diseases,</v>

1376
00:57:04.691 --> 00:57:09.691
<v Speaker 2>western diseases because they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to have these diseases on that</v>

1377
00:57:10.151 --> 00:57:11.320
<v Speaker 2>level in other countries.</v>

1378
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.820
<v Speaker 2>And then when we started exporting</v>
<v Speaker 2>molasses and we started exporting rice</v>

1379
00:57:15.821 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 2>and everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were exporting to these other</v>

1380
00:57:18.371 --> 00:57:20.650
<v Speaker 2>countries that didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all got sick,</v>

1381
00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 2>they all started getting sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1382
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 2>they all started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their obesity rates went up,</v>

1383
00:57:24.161 --> 00:57:26.370
<v Speaker 2>their diabetes rates went up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1384
00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.140
<v Speaker 2>that's just proof right there that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat that stuff,</v>

1385
00:57:29.290 --> 00:57:30.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will have those consequences.</v>

1386
00:57:30.941 --> 00:57:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

1387
00:57:31.570 --> 00:57:33.900
<v Speaker 2>one of the great ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1388
00:57:34.030 --> 00:57:35.980
<v Speaker 2>I've seen someone talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who it was,</v>

1389
00:57:35.981 --> 00:57:37.090
<v Speaker 2>it was discussing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were saying,</v>

1390
00:57:37.091 --> 00:57:40.120
<v Speaker 2>look at humans teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People did not suffer from the type of</v>

1391
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:43.050
<v Speaker 2>tooth decay they suffered from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what does that from what's from</v>

1392
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:45.670
<v Speaker 2>refined carbohydrates and sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1393
00:57:45.671 --> 00:57:49.150
<v Speaker 2>And especially sugary drinks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people were constantly drinking</v>

1394
00:57:49.151 --> 00:57:50.140
<v Speaker 2>soda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1395
00:57:50.141 --> 00:57:52.090
<v Speaker 2>you are just fucking torturing your</v>
<v Speaker 2>teeth.</v>

1396
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:54.150
<v Speaker 2>You're just throwing acid on your teeth</v>
<v Speaker 2>all day.</v>

1397
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:56.710
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I used to eat all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

1398
00:57:56.711 --> 00:57:58.240
<v Speaker 2>When I look back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know man,</v>

1399
00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.280
<v Speaker 2>I used to eat all that and look forward</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it too.</v>

1400
00:58:00.281 --> 00:58:01.114
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1401
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:04.240
<v Speaker 2>I guess I thought I felt okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really didn't.</v>

1402
00:58:04.650 --> 00:58:05.171
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1403
00:58:05.171 --> 00:58:06.700
<v Speaker 2>but I like thinking back on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1404
00:58:06.701 --> 00:58:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel way better now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But back then I thought I was okay.</v>

1405
00:58:09.821 --> 00:58:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I thought I was doing a good job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know any better.</v>

1406
00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even doing a low carb ketogenic diet,</v>

1407
00:58:15.161 --> 00:58:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I was still eating a ton of vegetable</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil,</v>

1408
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:17.711
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

1409
00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:18.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was</v>

1410
00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.790
<v Speaker 2>just like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1411
00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:23.380
<v Speaker 2>Chicken wings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't have carbs in them,</v>

1412
00:58:23.381 --> 00:58:24.540
<v Speaker 2>but they're deep fried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1413
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:26.390
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So reading that.</v>

1414
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1415
00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just stuff like that.</v>

1416
00:58:27.911 --> 00:58:30.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd say you still have in your diet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not know about.</v>

1417
00:58:30.980 --> 00:58:32.330
<v Speaker 2>I used to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1418
00:58:32.740 --> 00:58:34.540
<v Speaker 2>I was doing a low carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I figured,</v>

1419
00:58:34.541 --> 00:58:37.330
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll make a big salad and I'll dump this</v>

1420
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:40.300
<v Speaker 2>dressing all over it and addressing full</v>
<v Speaker 2>soybean oil,</v>

1421
00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:41.850
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1422
00:58:41.850 --> 00:58:43.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1423
00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:46.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you set out to do this,</v>

1424
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:49.730
<v Speaker 2>what was the motivation just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're on the health benefits that you</v>

1425
00:58:49.731 --> 00:58:52.480
<v Speaker 2>found from adjusting your own diet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think just,</v>

1426
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:54.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I just like to help people,</v>

1427
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like to make films that can help</v>

1428
00:58:56.111 --> 00:58:59.440
<v Speaker 2>people find their way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find what's good for them or what works</v>

1429
00:58:59.441 --> 00:59:01.810
<v Speaker 2>for them and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1430
00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:04.600
<v Speaker 2>they can take it or leave it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this falls in the category of</v>

1431
00:59:04.601 --> 00:59:09.220
<v Speaker 2>addiction too because the place that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from where he was addicted to drugs</v>

1432
00:59:09.221 --> 00:59:10.760
<v Speaker 2>and alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1433
00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:12.760
<v Speaker 2>and he was able to overcome a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1434
00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:15.220
<v Speaker 2>I think the Ketogenic Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think without it,</v>

1435
00:59:15.221 --> 00:59:17.060
<v Speaker 2>I think it would have been a lot harder</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1436
00:59:17.460 --> 00:59:17.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1437
00:59:17.970 --> 00:59:20.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the ketogenic diet played into</v>

1438
00:59:20.611 --> 00:59:21.740
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason</v>

1439
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:22.880
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did it,</v>

1440
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:26.210
<v Speaker 1>I did a ketogenic diet in Rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I got to Rehab,</v>

1441
00:59:26.211 --> 00:59:27.530
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not eating carbs.</v>

1442
00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Like that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why,</v>

1443
00:59:28.521 --> 00:59:29.910
<v Speaker 1>why did that help you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1444
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:32.600
<v Speaker 1>it helps with your cognitive function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps you to,</v>

1445
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:33.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>

1446
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:35.060
<v Speaker 1>it helps your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1447
00:59:35.061 --> 00:59:37.430
<v Speaker 1>helps your brain work better habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1448
00:59:37.431 --> 00:59:38.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

1449
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:40.070
<v Speaker 1>when I went to Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1450
00:59:40.071 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 1>it was about 245 pounds and I came out</v>
<v Speaker 1>at like two 15,</v>

1451
00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:45.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from doing a kito diet and I started</v>

1452
00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:48.380
<v Speaker 1>training again a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was still very sick and I was</v>

1453
00:59:48.381 --> 00:59:49.101
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1454
00:59:49.101 --> 00:59:50.780
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was messed up at that time.</v>

1455
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I wasn't right mentally or</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>

1456
00:59:53.871 --> 00:59:55.010
<v Speaker 1>I was just broken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1457
00:59:55.011 --> 00:59:57.170
<v Speaker 1>and I was ready for a change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1458
00:59:57.171 --> 00:59:58.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1459
00:59:58.371 --> 00:59:59.480
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very humbling,</v>

1460
00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:01.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still is actually to even talk</v>

1461
01:00:01.191 --> 01:00:01.520
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

1462
01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:02.660
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1463
01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.330
<v Speaker 1>getting knocked down a little bit helped</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1464
01:00:05.331 --> 01:00:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also helped me to start back over and</v>

1465
01:00:08.181 --> 01:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>start back over with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1466
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>with a better head on my shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1467
01:00:11.421 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>cause I used to think I knew everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1468
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>And now I think I know nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's important</v>

1469
01:00:15.921 --> 01:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>because I have this white belt mentality</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that I use on everything and</v>

1470
01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>actually got that from talking to from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabrizio verdon cause like he was always</v>

1471
01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always thinking I'm always learning.</v>

1472
01:00:24.891 --> 01:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I asked him one time,</v>

1473
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

1474
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:28.551
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1475
01:00:28.551 --> 01:00:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm a white belt mentality towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1476
01:00:30.711 --> 01:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think I've heard you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as well.</v>

1477
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's important though because</v>

1478
01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>we think we know everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We start preaching all this stuff and</v>

1479
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>then I turned around and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1480
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I really don't know what I'm talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1481
01:00:41.901 --> 01:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times I really better think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what I say more.</v>

1482
01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>And even now I'm just a lot more careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>about making absolute statements.</v>

1483
01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't make any more absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>statements or things like that because</v>

1484
01:00:50.810 --> 01:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>you want to be sure that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>conveying the right information to</v>

1485
01:00:52.861 --> 01:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1486
01:00:53.490 --> 01:00:55.320
<v Speaker 4>What were you saying before the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 4>started?</v>

1487
01:00:55.321 --> 01:00:57.180
<v Speaker 4>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going to bring it up again about</v>

1488
01:00:57.181 --> 01:00:58.760
<v Speaker 4>veganism coming from a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1489
01:00:58.830 --> 01:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Veganism started,</v>

1490
01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the seventh adventist church I</v>

1491
01:01:03.871 --> 01:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was,</v>

1492
01:01:04.981 --> 01:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1493
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a group of people that had a church and</v>

1494
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>the guy that led the church as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the church was like,</v>

1495
01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were following the Jewish kosher</v>

1496
01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>laws or whatever at first and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like no pigs or whatever else.</v>

1497
01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Shellfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1498
01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no pigs or shellfish.</v>

1499
01:01:21.930 --> 01:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>And then the guy just said and like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of took it to a next level and</v>

1500
01:01:25.351 --> 01:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

1501
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no meat,</v>

1502
01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>no animal products at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these people that were in this</v>

1503
01:01:29.431 --> 01:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>church where like the first real group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Vegans,</v>

1504
01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>a church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seventh adventist I think is what</v>

1505
01:01:35.461 --> 01:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is where it came from.</v>

1506
01:01:36.751 --> 01:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Like 1863 is when that like movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess started it.</v>

1507
01:01:40.261 --> 01:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

1508
01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I'd started early.</v>

1509
01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure people were doing it earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that obviously.</v>

1510
01:01:44.131 --> 01:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roots came in.</v>

1511
01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>And I just find that really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it does,</v>

1512
01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like a religion.</v>

1513
01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:51.800
<v Speaker 1>It seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1514
01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>today it seems like a lot of times you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

1515
01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get called out a lot on,</v>

1516
01:01:57.221 --> 01:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>on instagram and stuff like that from</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are Vegan saying like,</v>

1517
01:02:00.271 --> 01:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe you'd do this and Bob</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

1518
01:02:01.771 --> 01:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>but I would never go on their page and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say anything to them at all.</v>

1519
01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so proselytizing,</v>

1520
01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.500
<v Speaker 4>that's a big part of this whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>community is it's,</v>

1521
01:02:09.501 --> 01:02:11.630
<v Speaker 4>there's the moral high ground they stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

1522
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:14.510
<v Speaker 4>And then a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially people with Vegan in their</v>

1523
01:02:14.511 --> 01:02:18.030
<v Speaker 4>name and their screen name,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they always go after people and they,</v>

1524
01:02:18.031 --> 01:02:20.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they try to shame people and what</v>

1525
01:02:20.911 --> 01:02:23.220
<v Speaker 4>they're doing is in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1526
01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:26.520
<v Speaker 4>in many ways is a very good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not participating in factory</v>

1527
01:02:26.521 --> 01:02:27.420
<v Speaker 4>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1528
01:02:27.421 --> 01:02:30.870
<v Speaker 4>They're not participating in the Harz</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we see in these fucking peta videos</v>

1529
01:02:30.871 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 4>where you see cows and pigs and chickens</v>
<v Speaker 4>are just being tortured.</v>

1530
01:02:35.311 --> 01:02:37.770
<v Speaker 4>All that fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is disgusting and that should be</v>

1531
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:40.020
<v Speaker 4>eliminated and shouldn't be a part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>modern culture.</v>

1532
01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.880
<v Speaker 4>But in terms of like the humane raising</v>
<v Speaker 4>and killing of animals,</v>

1533
01:02:45.330 --> 01:02:47.520
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not going to live forever and I</v>

1534
01:02:47.521 --> 01:02:50.220
<v Speaker 4>don't care what you say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not into animal suffering.</v>

1535
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they should suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you try to say the people are not</v>

1536
01:02:52.801 --> 01:02:55.440
<v Speaker 4>herbivores or that people are herbivores</v>
<v Speaker 4>rather,</v>

1537
01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:57.300
<v Speaker 4>and then we're not omnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're crazy.</v>

1538
01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.830
<v Speaker 4>It's just not true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not fact,</v>

1539
01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:02.160
<v Speaker 4>and they show picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are not the teeth of a carnivore.</v>

1540
01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:04.290
<v Speaker 4>These are the two that were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not carnivores stupid.</v>

1541
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.690
<v Speaker 4>We're omnivores.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A chimpanzee.</v>

1542
01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1543
01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.860
<v Speaker 4>we look real similar and our teeth to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking chimps.</v>

1544
01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:15.870
<v Speaker 4>Chimps are omnivores and the human diet</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a very complex thing.</v>

1545
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:18.510
<v Speaker 4>When you attach that human diet to</v>
<v Speaker 4>ideology,</v>

1546
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:21.060
<v Speaker 4>then it gets really screwy because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not dealing,</v>

1547
01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:25.470
<v Speaker 4>you're not dealing with people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>being honest about dietary,</v>

1548
01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:29.520
<v Speaker 4>like what is really important and as far</v>
<v Speaker 4>as dietary requirements,</v>

1549
01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:32.310
<v Speaker 4>how your body functions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the studies show,</v>

1550
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.010
<v Speaker 4>if you look at it objectively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the objective,</v>

1551
01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.310
<v Speaker 4>the first thing anybody should say first</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing across the board,</v>

1552
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:39.660
<v Speaker 4>Garrett,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the fucking sugar.</v>

1553
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:41.760
<v Speaker 4>That's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get rid of all the refined</v>

1554
01:03:41.761 --> 01:03:44.250
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eat more vegetables.</v>

1555
01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:46.860
<v Speaker 4>I think you guys don't eat more</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetables.</v>

1556
01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.120
<v Speaker 4>Eat healthy fats.</v>

1557
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:53.100
<v Speaker 4>Get some formal omega fatty acids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Recognize that the omega fatty fatty</v>

1558
01:03:53.101 --> 01:03:58.101
<v Speaker 4>acids that you get from flax seed oil or</v>
<v Speaker 4>not as bioavailable is fact from studies</v>

1559
01:03:59.220 --> 01:04:02.010
<v Speaker 4>not as bioavailable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it mega fatty acids you get from fish</v>

1560
01:04:02.011 --> 01:04:04.200
<v Speaker 4>and meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just not the meat.</v>

1561
01:04:04.201 --> 01:04:05.160
<v Speaker 4>The protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1562
01:04:05.161 --> 01:04:08.880
<v Speaker 4>Broccoli has 15 groups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not as bioavailable.</v>

1563
01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:10.980
<v Speaker 4>You fucks and you know it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just not.</v>

1564
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:15.720
<v Speaker 4>So you can get bioavailable protein from</v>
<v Speaker 4>plants.</v>

1565
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.880
<v Speaker 4>You get it from hemp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get it from [inaudible],</v>

1566
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:20.310
<v Speaker 4>you get it from peas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pea protein is very good,</v>

1567
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 4>but it's not as good as the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the protein that you get from meat.</v>

1568
01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.430
<v Speaker 4>It's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can it sustain you?</v>

1569
01:04:26.431 --> 01:04:29.050
<v Speaker 4>Yes it can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you be a healthy person and live a</v>

1570
01:04:29.051 --> 01:04:31.980
<v Speaker 4>fucking balanced life on a completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>vegetarian diet?</v>

1571
01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:36.450
<v Speaker 4>100% but I would always recommend eat</v>
<v Speaker 4>free range eggs.</v>

1572
01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.740
<v Speaker 4>You're not hurting a chicken.</v>

1573
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:39.810
<v Speaker 4>Nothing gets hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is free food.</v>

1574
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.070
<v Speaker 4>We have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have chickens.</v>

1575
01:04:41.071 --> 01:04:42.720
<v Speaker 4>They roam around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they eat vegetables,</v>

1576
01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:45.270
<v Speaker 4>nobody eats them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The chickens live a fucking healthy</v>

1577
01:04:45.271 --> 01:04:46.170
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They lay eggs,</v>

1578
01:04:46.171 --> 01:04:49.350
<v Speaker 4>we eat the eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the eggs are healthy as fuck ethos.</v>

1579
01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:53.280
<v Speaker 4>Find a place that has free range.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chickens eat the eggs.</v>

1580
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not Vegan,</v>

1581
01:04:54.721 --> 01:04:57.240
<v Speaker 4>but it is vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to get rid of dairy and you</v>

1582
01:04:57.241 --> 01:04:58.650
<v Speaker 4>don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it man.</v>

1583
01:04:58.651 --> 01:05:01.080
<v Speaker 4>I've seen gary dairy farms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucked up.</v>

1584
01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.700
<v Speaker 4>You see what they're doing at cows and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1585
01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:06.540
<v Speaker 4>you know what the way they treat them</v>
<v Speaker 4>and the way they're raised them and just</v>

1586
01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:09.720
<v Speaker 4>the whole idea behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like making them lactate.</v>

1587
01:05:09.721 --> 01:05:10.590
<v Speaker 4>The only time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but cows.</v>

1588
01:05:10.591 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 4>Lactate is when they have a baby,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1589
01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:14.280
<v Speaker 4>So they keep them in this state and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>

1590
01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:18.940
<v Speaker 4>it's unnatural.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that is a reality of dairy</v>

1591
01:05:18.941 --> 01:05:19.600
<v Speaker 4>production.</v>

1592
01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:21.010
<v Speaker 4>And if you don't want to be a part of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1593
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:25.420
<v Speaker 4>that's a hundred percent noble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we have to be honest about nutrition</v>

1594
01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:28.930
<v Speaker 4>requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not about the ideology of veganism.</v>

1595
01:05:28.931 --> 01:05:30.370
<v Speaker 4>And this is the problem with these</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1596
01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.670
<v Speaker 4>And so many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the ones with Vegan attached</v>

1597
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:36.300
<v Speaker 4>to their identity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they use the name like v I'm,</v>

1598
01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:39.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm Vegan warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is Vegan prints and the Vegan</v>

1599
01:05:39.461 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 4>defender,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking morons who joined a</v>

1600
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.170
<v Speaker 4>gang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what they do is they start eating</v>

1601
01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:45.640
<v Speaker 4>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they start talking shit,</v>

1602
01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:49.600
<v Speaker 4>and they go looking to just go after</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody who's not on the same page as</v>

1603
01:05:49.601 --> 01:05:51.820
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the real problem is people that</v>

1604
01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:54.110
<v Speaker 4>watch a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what the health or something,</v>

1605
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:56.080
<v Speaker 4>and then think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that this is,</v>

1606
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.200
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm killing myself by not being a Vegan.</v>

1607
01:05:59.230 --> 01:06:01.840
<v Speaker 4>Nope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to google what the health</v>

1608
01:06:01.841 --> 01:06:05.650
<v Speaker 4>debunked and find out the actual science</v>
<v Speaker 4>because what they're talking about is</v>

1609
01:06:05.651 --> 01:06:06.460
<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

1610
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.820
<v Speaker 4>They're not being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they've done is make a Vegan</v>

1611
01:06:09.821 --> 01:06:12.850
<v Speaker 4>proselytizing movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're trying to get people to join in</v>

1612
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.850
<v Speaker 4>because that's what they do and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>these people,</v>

1613
01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:18.820
<v Speaker 4>but they give up a lot of these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to a point where their health</v>

1614
01:06:18.821 --> 01:06:20.680
<v Speaker 4>can't take it anymore and you fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>give up.</v>

1615
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.840
<v Speaker 4>Chris Kresser is a perfect example.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1616
01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.970
<v Speaker 4>have you interviewed him for a film?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not yet,</v>

1617
01:06:24.971 --> 01:06:26.350
<v Speaker 4>but we will.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking brilliant.</v>

1618
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.170
<v Speaker 4>And he was a macro,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was a macrobiotic Vegan.</v>

1619
01:06:29.171 --> 01:06:32.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean this guy was all off the charts</v>
<v Speaker 4>with veganism and eventually realize his</v>

1620
01:06:32.981 --> 01:06:34.600
<v Speaker 4>body was falling apart and gave up on</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1621
01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:39.100
<v Speaker 4>There's some people that owned that</v>
<v Speaker 4>restaurant in California and Hollywood.</v>

1622
01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:42.070
<v Speaker 4>What is it called?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The something cafe.</v>

1623
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.120
<v Speaker 4>Gratitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thank you,</v>

1624
01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:44.140
<v Speaker 4>Kathy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gratitude.</v>

1625
01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.401
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:46.630
<v Speaker 4>These people were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1627
01:06:46.631 --> 01:06:47.920
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking health was falling</v>
<v Speaker 4>apart,</v>

1628
01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:51.670
<v Speaker 4>so they decided to raise their own</v>
<v Speaker 4>cattle and ether on meat and vegans</v>

1629
01:06:51.671 --> 01:06:55.360
<v Speaker 4>found out they got death threats and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were fucking going after them.</v>

1630
01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:56.193
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ma'am.</v>

1631
01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:57.910
<v Speaker 4>It was a terrifying thing for these</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

1632
01:06:57.911 --> 01:06:59.710
<v Speaker 4>They're all our folks and they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

1633
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.160
<v Speaker 4>they have their own farm and they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>raising their own farm animals and they</v>

1634
01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:05.710
<v Speaker 4>decided to start eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when they made these posts about</v>

1635
01:07:05.711 --> 01:07:07.720
<v Speaker 4>starting these people went after them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

1636
01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:08.853
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>

1637
01:07:09.070 --> 01:07:11.350
<v Speaker 4>this is not kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1638
01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:15.310
<v Speaker 4>this is not someone who's compassionate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking cunt,</v>

1639
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:18.100
<v Speaker 4>better in a gang and that they're in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>plant gang.</v>

1640
01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you talk,</v>

1641
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:22.450
<v Speaker 4>and I'm sure you've seen it by doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>this carnivore diet thing,</v>

1642
01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.390
<v Speaker 4>if you do anything that's outside of</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1643
01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.380
<v Speaker 4>they go after you.</v>

1644
01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Start jumping down throat just so</v>

1645
01:07:28.321 --> 01:07:30.630
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You keep mentioning,</v>

1646
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:31.590
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to talk.</v>

1647
01:07:31.591 --> 01:07:33.120
<v Speaker 1>I sit in a like in vegetables or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1648
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:34.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1649
01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:37.350
<v Speaker 1>I do eat vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I casually,</v>

1650
01:07:37.351 --> 01:07:41.730
<v Speaker 1>if you have to find the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Kenogenic diet before I went on the</v>

1651
01:07:41.731 --> 01:07:44.980
<v Speaker 1>carnivore diet was mainly a vegetarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

1652
01:07:45.050 --> 01:07:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Like mostly vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would eat a lot of vegetables,</v>

1653
01:07:47.131 --> 01:07:50.070
<v Speaker 1>big salads and all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I throw a little bit of meat in</v>

1654
01:07:50.071 --> 01:07:52.590
<v Speaker 1>because I was very concerned about</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating too much protein.</v>

1655
01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:55.560
<v Speaker 1>So I'd only eat 80 to 100 grams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein a day.</v>

1656
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Now I eat double that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's sort of what the switch</v>

1657
01:07:59.671 --> 01:08:01.800
<v Speaker 1>was and it's just an intervention for</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1658
01:08:02.170 --> 01:08:03.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel it.</v>

1659
01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.360
<v Speaker 1>I feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think that the best healthiest</v>

1660
01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:10.680
<v Speaker 1>diet for a human being would be a Vegan</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet with like three or four ounces of</v>

1661
01:08:10.681 --> 01:08:12.630
<v Speaker 1>meat thrown in it at every meal.</v>

1662
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:14.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to have the animal fat and animal</v>

1663
01:08:14.311 --> 01:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that would be really smart.</v>

1664
01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm starting to think the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think front loading your body with the</v>

1665
01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 1>nutrients that it needs because our</v>
<v Speaker 1>body's always in search for nutrients.</v>

1666
01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>That's why we're hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always searching for the nutrients</v>

1667
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>that we need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vitamins and minerals that we need</v>

1668
01:08:28.821 --> 01:08:32.600
<v Speaker 1>and all the macro nutrients we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we front load at first and give us a,</v>

1669
01:08:32.601 --> 01:08:33.201
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chunk,</v>

1670
01:08:33.201 --> 01:08:36.680
<v Speaker 1>a nice steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're body's not hungry afterwards.</v>

1671
01:08:36.681 --> 01:08:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what's happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1672
01:08:38.121 --> 01:08:42.320
<v Speaker 1>where now I'm sort of giving my body</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it needs and it never,</v>

1673
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:44.420
<v Speaker 1>it's never asking for what it doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

1674
01:08:44.650 --> 01:08:48.610
<v Speaker 2>I saw a comment the other day and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those animal videos when those horrible</v>

1675
01:08:48.611 --> 01:08:51.310
<v Speaker 2>factory farming videos said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of this video,</v>

1676
01:08:51.311 --> 01:08:56.311
<v Speaker 2>I'm 60% vegan now with my diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What exactly,</v>

1677
01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:59.980
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's the type of morons we're</v>

1678
01:08:59.981 --> 01:09:02.140
<v Speaker 2>dealing with here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that are not looking at</v>

1679
01:09:02.141 --> 01:09:04.180
<v Speaker 2>themselves or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>

1680
01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:04.730
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1681
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:07.320
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to stand on the moral</v>
<v Speaker 2>high ground and they've,</v>

1682
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.220
<v Speaker 2>if they know the meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't.</v>

1683
01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:10.480
<v Speaker 2>So they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well baby,</v>

1684
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost all Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1685
01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:14.570
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well those poor little fucking cows in</v>

1686
01:09:14.571 --> 01:09:18.460
<v Speaker 2>murder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 40% almost everybody who eats a</v>

1687
01:09:18.461 --> 01:09:21.070
<v Speaker 2>balanced diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60% vegan.</v>

1688
01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:22.420
<v Speaker 2>That's riddick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1689
01:09:22.421 --> 01:09:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a ridiculous thing to say,</v>

1690
01:09:24.341 --> 01:09:28.570
<v Speaker 2>but this is the problem is people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not just eating things,</v>

1691
01:09:28.571 --> 01:09:33.190
<v Speaker 2>they're posturing like outs there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're publicly posturing on their</v>

1692
01:09:33.191 --> 01:09:36.010
<v Speaker 2>position on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on morals and ethics.</v>

1693
01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:37.300
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see it all the time.</v>

1694
01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We see it in every aspect of fitness.</v>

1695
01:09:39.551 --> 01:09:40.384
<v Speaker 2>We see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1696
01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.210
<v Speaker 2>You see in all areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's also a difference</v>

1697
01:09:43.211 --> 01:09:44.080
<v Speaker 2>between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1698
01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>survival and there's a difference</v>

1699
01:09:46.451 --> 01:09:47.890
<v Speaker 2>between performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

1700
01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:49.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're asking our bodies,</v>

1701
01:09:49.391 --> 01:09:51.580
<v Speaker 2>all three of us at the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're asking our bodies to do some</v>

1702
01:09:51.581 --> 01:09:54.880
<v Speaker 2>demanding thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think in that case like maybe we do</v>

1703
01:09:54.881 --> 01:09:57.490
<v Speaker 2>need a little bit more meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if meat is going to be kind</v>

1704
01:09:57.491 --> 01:10:01.450
<v Speaker 2>of our main driver of our calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it kind of makes sense that we would</v>

1705
01:10:01.451 --> 01:10:04.930
<v Speaker 2>need a little bit more of that than</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe your average person.</v>

1706
01:10:04.931 --> 01:10:06.670
<v Speaker 2>So what you said about the three ounces</v>
<v Speaker 2>of meat,</v>

1707
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:10.240
<v Speaker 2>every couple meals probably makes sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>and probably be great for survival.</v>

1708
01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:13.780
<v Speaker 2>The other thing that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting though is that even for</v>

1709
01:10:13.781 --> 01:10:16.930
<v Speaker 2>those of us had been trying to seek the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth and for those of us have been</v>

1710
01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.040
<v Speaker 2>trying to eat good and trying to train</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not like you're like,</v>

1711
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:23.410
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's Joe Rogan hundred 50 years old.</v>

1712
01:10:23.411 --> 01:10:24.660
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1713
01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:26.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we still don't really,</v>

1714
01:10:26.621 --> 01:10:27.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1715
01:10:27.551 --> 01:10:29.320
<v Speaker 2>you're not insuring anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1716
01:10:29.321 --> 01:10:30.430
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1717
01:10:30.431 --> 01:10:33.970
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to just live the life that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to live the best way possible</v>

1718
01:10:33.971 --> 01:10:35.320

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1719
01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.750
<v Speaker 2>If I lived to be 150 those last couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of years are going to suck effect.</v>

1720
01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.170
<v Speaker 2>I last couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1721
01:10:41.171 --> 01:10:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not convinced that people won't in</v>

1722
01:10:43.661 --> 01:10:45.020
<v Speaker 2>our lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean with,</v>

1723
01:10:45.021 --> 01:10:47.410
<v Speaker 2>with science and fucking stem cells,</v>

1724
01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:49.730
<v Speaker 1>they said right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're born today,</v>

1725
01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.220
<v Speaker 1>you have a chance of living to be one oh</v>
<v Speaker 1>four is like that</v>

1726
01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.980
<v Speaker 2>one oh four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to live to be one of four</v>

1727
01:10:53.981 --> 01:10:56.030
<v Speaker 2>bitch hit by a car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1728
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Asteroids.</v>

1729
01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I and a lot of their people</v>

1730
01:10:59.791 --> 01:11:01.350
<v Speaker 1>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started 30,</v>

1731
01:11:01.351 --> 01:11:02.940
<v Speaker 1>40 years in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1732
01:11:02.941 --> 01:11:05.460
<v Speaker 1>We started too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know when you started eating</v>

1733
01:11:05.461 --> 01:11:07.080
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know that it wasn't your whole</v>

1734
01:11:07.081 --> 01:11:07.570
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1735
01:11:07.570 --> 01:11:08.341
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1736
01:11:08.341 --> 01:11:09.550
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1737
01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I was certainly no high refined</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate up until 10</v>

1738
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.030
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1739
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've really got into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1740
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:22.470
<v Speaker 3>I've always been supplementing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>vitamins and I've been getting my blood</v>

1741
01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:27.471
<v Speaker 3>work done for a couple of decades now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the real shift was switching to</v>

1742
01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:29.700
<v Speaker 3>Quito.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genic do you know where the shift came</v>

1743
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:30.001
<v Speaker 3>from?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me?</v>

1744
01:11:30.001 --> 01:11:31.290
<v Speaker 3>And you're probably not going to believe</v>
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>

1745
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.370
<v Speaker 3>The shift came from me after going to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>show where I first met you,</v>

1746
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:38.100
<v Speaker 3>very time we first met.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if you remember it.</v>

1747
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was outside the Ice House in</v>

1748
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:42.480
<v Speaker 3>Pasadena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I came up to you and talk to you</v>

1749
01:11:42.481 --> 01:11:45.840
<v Speaker 3>with Brian Callen and you were talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about diet and you were saying,</v>

1750
01:11:45.841 --> 01:11:48.180
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that people eat all this</v>

1751
01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:48.781
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like,</v>

1752
01:11:48.781 --> 01:11:50.680
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you say every town I go to,</v>

1753
01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.200
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first thing I do is look for the</v>

1754
01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:55.320
<v Speaker 3>whole foods and I find the whole foods</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I go get my food.</v>

1755
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:56.790
<v Speaker 3>And I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1756
01:11:56.791 --> 01:11:59.100
<v Speaker 3>I travel all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Joe Rogan can do this,</v>

1757
01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I not doing it?</v>

1758
01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I being so lazy with my Diet?</v>

1759
01:12:02.641 --> 01:12:04.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm so fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what's going on?</v>

1760
01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:07.550
<v Speaker 3>And I that day actually really made me</v>
<v Speaker 3>think about a lot and I,</v>

1761
01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:11.400
<v Speaker 3>I saw you as an inspiration after that</v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1762
01:12:11.401 --> 01:12:13.560
<v Speaker 3>I started really digging into it a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>more so.</v>

1763
01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:15.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I spend a lot of time in hotel.</v>

1764
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:18.420
<v Speaker 3>So what I would do is I would show up at</v>
<v Speaker 3>a place on Thursday and I'd be there til</v>

1765
01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.171
<v Speaker 3>Sunday,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1766
01:12:19.171 --> 01:12:20.910
<v Speaker 3>especially when I was doing comedy clubs</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the road.</v>

1767
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.450
<v Speaker 3>So I go to whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd stock up on Kombucha,</v>

1768
01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 3>I would get a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of healthy snacks,</v>

1769
01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.100
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of raw almonds and things along</v>
<v Speaker 3>those lines.</v>

1770
01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:31.890
<v Speaker 3>So that way I had something in my hotel</v>
<v Speaker 3>room all the time.</v>

1771
01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:34.890
<v Speaker 3>So if I'm writing or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting done working out or something</v>

1772
01:12:34.891 --> 01:12:36.540
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not eating candy bars.</v>

1773
01:12:36.541 --> 01:12:39.510
<v Speaker 3>I'm done rating the hotel minibar and</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat bullshit.</v>

1774
01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:41.400
<v Speaker 3>That makes all the difference in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world doc.</v>

1775
01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:44.250
<v Speaker 3>And that's how I travel now too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just have everything ready to go.</v>

1776
01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get a breath.</v>

1777
01:12:45.241 --> 01:12:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Bring yourself a big case of bottled</v>
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

1778
01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:48.090
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make,</v>

1779
01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:51.210
<v Speaker 3>make sure you got stuff in your room</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can sustain you.</v>

1780
01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.840
<v Speaker 3>And if it carnivores,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does it bring some,</v>

1781
01:12:52.841 --> 01:12:54.060
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sardines in a can?</v>

1782
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:55.260
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a lot of that.</v>

1783
01:12:55.261 --> 01:12:58.320
<v Speaker 3>I bring sardines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bring a oysters,</v>

1784
01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.440
<v Speaker 3>I bring oysters with me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to believe this.</v>

1785
01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.870
<v Speaker 3>My first sardine I've ever eaten was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like two days ago.</v>

1786
01:13:03.871 --> 01:13:05.490
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just so,</v>

1787
01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.750
<v Speaker 3>because you guys talk about it so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>d'agostino we went and visited Dom</v>

1788
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:11.730
<v Speaker 3>D'agostino and interviewed him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just kept talking about these</v>

1789
01:13:11.731 --> 01:13:12.690
<v Speaker 3>sardines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like,</v>

1790
01:13:12.691 --> 01:13:13.980
<v Speaker 3>finally I got to try it.</v>

1791
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.670
<v Speaker 3>They taste just like tuna fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The great southern.</v>

1792
01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe you'd never had</v>

1793
01:13:18.211 --> 01:13:19.320
<v Speaker 3>sardines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

1794
01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 3>They're great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds gross.</v>

1795
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:23.010
<v Speaker 3>It they sound gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I had him like about two weeks ago</v>

1796
01:13:23.011 --> 01:13:24.410
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe maybe a month or two.</v>

1797
01:13:24.411 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 3>Wild.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Wild Planet.</v>

1798
01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:27.990
<v Speaker 3>Wild Planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olive oil.</v>

1799
01:13:27.991 --> 01:13:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They also have macro and a bunch of</v>

1800
01:13:30.171 --> 01:13:32.400
<v Speaker 3>other different things that I was used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to.</v>

1801
01:13:32.401 --> 01:13:36.210
<v Speaker 3>The ones that my grandfather get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we like peel the can down and then it</v>

1802
01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:38.280
<v Speaker 3>was like these little little fish in</v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

1803
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:43.260
<v Speaker 3>Those I love those look too gross to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's what I remember seeing as</v>

1804
01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Sardi man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're good.</v>

1805
01:13:44.551 --> 01:13:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I like sardines are very healthy for you</v>
<v Speaker 3>as long as,</v>

1806
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing though,</v>

1807
01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:52.680
<v Speaker 3>I do have to say I was eating a can or</v>
<v Speaker 3>two a day and then I found arsenic in my</v>

1808
01:13:52.681 --> 01:13:53.550
<v Speaker 3>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1809
01:13:53.551 --> 01:13:54.384
<v Speaker 3>I heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1810
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.750
<v Speaker 3>And then the doctor's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just lay off that,</v>

1811
01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.010
<v Speaker 3>let's do another test in a month.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it was gone.</v>

1812
01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:02.010
<v Speaker 3>And so it's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of heavy metals in the</v>

1813
01:14:02.011 --> 01:14:04.230
<v Speaker 3>water and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're low on the,</v>

1814
01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:05.420
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1815
01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:06.660
<v Speaker 3>in the ocean floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1816
01:14:06.661 --> 01:14:09.390
<v Speaker 3>they're down there with all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:14:09.450 --> 01:14:10.980
<v Speaker 3>Speaking of fish and stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

1818
01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 3>it's important for people</v>

1819
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.700
<v Speaker 1>to get some Omega threes and if they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try a carnivore diet and a way</v>

1820
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:19.630
<v Speaker 1>to do that as either eat the grass fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>beef or to add in some a salmon.</v>

1821
01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So I add in salmon twice a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually just pokey or something like</v>

1822
01:14:22.901 --> 01:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just eat it,</v>

1823
01:14:24.430 --> 01:14:25.263
<v Speaker 1>eat it by itself.</v>

1824
01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:26.533
<v Speaker 4>Oils.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1825
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:28.780
<v Speaker 4>what about just getting some fish oil</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1826
01:14:28.781 --> 01:14:29.660
<v Speaker 4>and taking that in.</v>

1827
01:14:30.090 --> 01:14:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I like,</v>

1828
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I like whole foods and I like things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole food environment.</v>

1829
01:14:35.301 --> 01:14:37.550
<v Speaker 1>And the more I do research on things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look into it,</v>

1830
01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:40.490
<v Speaker 1>the more I realize like the whole foods</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really where it's at.</v>

1831
01:14:40.491 --> 01:14:42.470
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>

1832
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:44.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a lot of studies on it</v>

1833
01:14:44.751 --> 01:14:46.580
<v Speaker 1>and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just feel like,</v>

1834
01:14:46.581 --> 01:14:49.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that the way that they make fish</v>

1835
01:14:49.071 --> 01:14:51.740
<v Speaker 1>oil and the way that it sits around</v>
<v Speaker 1>forever and stuff like that,</v>

1836
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't use it,</v>

1837
01:14:54.141 --> 01:14:55.050
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1838
01:14:55.220 --> 01:14:57.050
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I do use because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

1839
01:14:57.170 --> 01:14:59.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't stand eating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

1840
01:14:59.211 --> 01:15:00.710
<v Speaker 1>stand to eat the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like the fish.</v>

1841
01:15:00.711 --> 01:15:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I like the salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1842
01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I do not like liver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but beef liver is the highest and</v>

1843
01:15:05.331 --> 01:15:08.870
<v Speaker 1>nutrients you want to talk about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>superfood is like these true superfood.</v>

1844
01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way More than keen water.</v>

1845
01:15:11.490 --> 01:15:13.550
<v Speaker 1>And there's so many nutrients in beef</v>
<v Speaker 1>liver,</v>

1846
01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:17.150
<v Speaker 1>but I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I take beef liver tablets or capsules</v>

1847
01:15:17.151 --> 01:15:17.931
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1848
01:15:17.931 --> 01:15:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I love liver and those tastes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1849
01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to cook it,</v>

1850
01:15:22.311 --> 01:15:23.420
<v Speaker 1>so I've never actually made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:15:23.770 --> 01:15:28.270
<v Speaker 4>All you do is take a dusting of like</v>
<v Speaker 4>ketogenetic flower,</v>

1852
01:15:28.410 --> 01:15:30.430
<v Speaker 4>like almond flour or something like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1853
01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:33.190
<v Speaker 4>Put It on there and fried in butter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just fry it,</v>

1854
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.980
<v Speaker 4>slice that baby up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then fry with onions.</v>

1855
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.840
<v Speaker 4>You like onions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to see a youtube video</v>

1856
01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:38.674
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh Dude,</v>

1857
01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I got some elk liver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to try that,</v>

1858
01:15:40.931 --> 01:15:41.980
<v Speaker 4>that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that'll fuck off.</v>

1859
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:44.650
<v Speaker 4>You think beef liver strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd take out elk lever.</v>

1860
01:15:44.651 --> 01:15:45.290
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

1861
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:48.220
<v Speaker 4>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can deadlift liverwurst and I</v>

1862
01:15:48.221 --> 01:15:49.180
<v Speaker 4>thought it was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1863
01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:50.530
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a different thing kyle.</v>

1864
01:15:50.610 --> 01:15:52.480
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty good too though.</v>

1865
01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Your Buddy Kyle Kingsbury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he recommended the liverwurst and I was,</v>

1866
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:57.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I didn't want to do it.</v>

1867
01:15:58.330 --> 01:15:59.470
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

1868
01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.120
<v Speaker 1>It's just like mixed in with other stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something really good.</v>

1869
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:04.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what's in livermore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's a good question.</v>

1870
01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.570
<v Speaker 4>It's liver and kidneys and hearts and</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's find out.</v>

1871
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:09.860
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those things are great.</v>

1872
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:12.740
<v Speaker 4>Organ meat is the best meat for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And liver in particular.</v>

1873
01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.620
<v Speaker 4>That's why wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the Alpha is established in the</v>

1874
01:16:15.621 --> 01:16:18.140
<v Speaker 4>pack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Alpha will always eat the wolf or</v>

1875
01:16:18.141 --> 01:16:20.470
<v Speaker 4>eat the liver first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can one,</v>

1876
01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:22.010
<v Speaker 4>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was this crazy,</v>

1877
01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:23.810
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that this guy was doing where he</v>

1878
01:16:23.811 --> 01:16:27.590
<v Speaker 4>was living with wolves and a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had established himself as the Alpha</v>

1879
01:16:27.591 --> 01:16:29.840
<v Speaker 4>in the pack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And one of the ways he would do that,</v>

1880
01:16:29.841 --> 01:16:33.980
<v Speaker 4>they would have a kill and he would</v>
<v Speaker 4>plant a liver inside the kill and then</v>

1881
01:16:33.981 --> 01:16:36.410
<v Speaker 4>he would eat the liver and grout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the other worlds.</v>

1882
01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:39.200
<v Speaker 4>We would let him go because he's got the</v>
<v Speaker 4>liver because once the,</v>

1883
01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:43.970
<v Speaker 4>but then he had to leave in order to</v>
<v Speaker 4>help someone else.</v>

1884
01:16:43.971 --> 01:16:48.290
<v Speaker 4>This guy had a farm that was being</v>
<v Speaker 4>attacked by wolves and so he set up some</v>

1885
01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:53.291
<v Speaker 4>speakers and had some other wolves howl</v>
<v Speaker 4>and essentially try to convince these</v>

1886
01:16:53.331 --> 01:16:55.490
<v Speaker 4>wolves that were killing these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1887
01:16:55.491 --> 01:16:58.070
<v Speaker 4>animals that a new pack had been in</v>
<v Speaker 4>town.</v>

1888
01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.200
<v Speaker 4>And with these big speakers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these other wolves were like,</v>

1889
01:17:00.201 --> 01:17:01.850
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of fucking wolves here.</v>

1890
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:04.250
<v Speaker 4>Let's get outta here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he is literally worth,</v>

1891
01:17:04.251 --> 01:17:07.370
<v Speaker 4>but he was gone for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for a couple months and when he</v>

1892
01:17:07.371 --> 01:17:08.840
<v Speaker 4>came back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other walls were like,</v>

1893
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 4>fuck you motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where</v>

1894
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.710
<v Speaker 3>the Alpha now and he almost got killed</v>
<v Speaker 3>by these walls.</v>

1895
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:16.760
<v Speaker 3>It's terrifying to watch him whimpering</v>
<v Speaker 3>in front of these walls while these</v>

1896
01:17:16.761 --> 01:17:19.190
<v Speaker 3>wolves are like inches away from him</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their teeth,</v>

1897
01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.260
<v Speaker 3>like big fucking wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt,</v>

1898
01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.470
<v Speaker 3>why is the idea that while he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>studies on walls and they were all</v>

1899
01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.560
<v Speaker 3>contained in this large fenced in area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is also highly criticized because</v>

1900
01:17:30.141 --> 01:17:31.820
<v Speaker 3>there's some videos on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on uh,</v>

1901
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:36.470
<v Speaker 3>youtube that you could see of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>wolves attacking this one Beta wolf.</v>

1902
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:38.150
<v Speaker 3>And one of the reasons why that</v>
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>

1903
01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:41.120
<v Speaker 3>so essentially it is the fact that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>are contained in a very small area.</v>

1904
01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:43.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's big in that it's a few</v>
<v Speaker 3>acres,</v>

1905
01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:47.750
<v Speaker 3>but it's small in terms of law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a wolf's natural roaming would be.</v>

1906
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:50.930
<v Speaker 3>They do say that animals tend to go for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the liver,</v>

1907
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:52.310
<v Speaker 3>like they know about it so long.</v>

1908
01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:54.230
<v Speaker 3>If you look at salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

1909
01:17:54.730 --> 01:17:58.190
<v Speaker 3>there'd be a bunch of salmon in a river</v>
<v Speaker 3>and like there'd be a big chunk taken</v>

1910
01:17:58.191 --> 01:17:59.930
<v Speaker 3>out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the rest of the body would be there.</v>

1911
01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.560
<v Speaker 3>And the reason it was a bear would</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically rip out its liver.</v>

1912
01:18:03.650 --> 01:18:04.180
<v Speaker 3>And that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1913
01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.130
<v Speaker 3>that's what it was after.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when the sector and full surplus</v>

1914
01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:10.130
<v Speaker 3>or Sam and everyone go get four or five</v>
<v Speaker 3>livers,</v>

1915
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:11.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it wanted to eat that.</v>

1916
01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:15.800
<v Speaker 3>So it's like looking at the salmon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost like an egg and that's the egg</v>

1917
01:18:15.801 --> 01:18:16.251
<v Speaker 3>yolk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1918
01:18:16.251 --> 01:18:17.630
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an important part.</v>

1919
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:18.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most animals,</v>

1920
01:18:18.831 --> 01:18:21.650
<v Speaker 3>like most predatory animals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go for the guts first.</v>

1921
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:24.050
<v Speaker 3>It's really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And back in the day,</v>

1922
01:18:24.051 --> 01:18:27.170
<v Speaker 3>I think when they used to kill things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would say that even human beings</v>

1923
01:18:27.171 --> 01:18:29.690
<v Speaker 3>where you all the organs first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1924
01:18:29.691 --> 01:18:31.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean Origami Kidney Pie and she didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>like them.</v>

1925
01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:33.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they didn't know they were doing it</v>

1926
01:18:33.921 --> 01:18:36.080
<v Speaker 3>for nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just didn't want to waste anything.</v>

1927
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:37.010
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the party,</v>

1928
01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:40.940
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right is great too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got some elkhart and then probably</v>

1929
01:18:40.941 --> 01:18:42.560
<v Speaker 3>went with what tasted better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1930
01:18:42.561 --> 01:18:43.610
<v Speaker 3>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>eventually,</v>

1931
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.290
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the heart tasted great,</v>

1932
01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.173
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's,</v>

1933
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.181
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the heart doesn't,</v>

1934
01:18:47.181 --> 01:18:51.170
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't taste the best.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best is like backstrap and which is</v>

1935
01:18:51.171 --> 01:18:53.220
<v Speaker 3>the loins are the tenderloins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1936
01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.240
<v Speaker 3>which is the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That stuff is the most tender.</v>

1937
01:18:56.241 --> 01:18:57.830
<v Speaker 3>And a lot of people feel like it's the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>

1938
01:18:58.070 --> 01:19:00.740
<v Speaker 3>Some people like in a cow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they like in New York's trip it's like a</v>

1939
01:19:00.741 --> 01:19:01.370
<v Speaker 3>more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1940
01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:05.930
<v Speaker 3>it's got a more richer taste.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But most people don't find the liver to</v>

1941
01:19:05.931 --> 01:19:08.330
<v Speaker 3>taste the best,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's just cause it's a strong</v>

1942
01:19:08.331 --> 01:19:09.710
<v Speaker 3>flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1943
01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:10.490
<v Speaker 3>I've always liked it.</v>

1944
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:13.640
<v Speaker 3>I've always liked liver beef,</v>
<v Speaker 3>liver desiccated beef.</v>

1945
01:19:13.641 --> 01:19:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Liver capsules actually tastes like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fart.</v>

1946
01:19:16.750 --> 01:19:19.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you burp.</v>

1947
01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:20.110
<v Speaker 3>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1948
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:21.620
<v Speaker 3>Just when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when when you take them,</v>

1949
01:19:21.650 --> 01:19:24.440
<v Speaker 3>you can drink as much water as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always going to get that little</v>

1950
01:19:24.441 --> 01:19:25.680
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well he's like,</v>

1951
01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:27.200
<v Speaker 3>he's like a fart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1952
01:19:27.690 --> 01:19:29.690
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like when you eat the meat,</v>

1953
01:19:29.691 --> 01:19:31.880
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't taste like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We eat the meat of the liver.</v>

1954
01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:33.290
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't taste that.</v>

1955
01:19:33.291 --> 01:19:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you guys should be high</v>
<v Speaker 3>end farts.</v>

1956
01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:38.870
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Kresser is a big proponent of</v>

1957
01:19:38.871 --> 01:19:40.880
<v Speaker 3>Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Me and he said when he had a bunch of</v>

1958
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:43.480
<v Speaker 3>autoimmune issues as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said that auto,</v>

1959
01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:46.910
<v Speaker 3>that eating liver and heart and kidneys</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stuff like that,</v>

1960
01:19:46.911 --> 01:19:48.860
<v Speaker 3>all that stuff really helped him</v>
<v Speaker 3>tremendously.</v>

1961
01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I wish I like liverwurst more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not that I don't like it that much.</v>

1962
01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:54.640
<v Speaker 3>Force yourself to eat it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1963
01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:57.380
<v Speaker 3>and force yourself to eat cow's liver</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you don't really have problems.</v>

1964
01:19:57.381 --> 01:19:59.020
<v Speaker 3>You're getting calves liver most of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

1965
01:19:59.021 --> 01:19:59.990
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1966
01:19:59.991 --> 01:20:02.540
<v Speaker 3>even though you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do for chuffed to edit,</v>

1967
01:20:02.541 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 3>your ended up actually liking and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1968
01:20:04.011 --> 01:20:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know sometimes you can eat it in a</v>

1969
01:20:05.991 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 3>place that cooks it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you go to a</v>

1970
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.140
<v Speaker 4>really good restaurant that serves liver</v>
<v Speaker 4>and onions,</v>

1971
01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.570
<v Speaker 4>a good restaurant that serves it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's delicious.</v>

1972
01:20:12.571 --> 01:20:15.270
<v Speaker 4>It's just you've got to find someone who</v>
<v Speaker 4>knows how to prepare it properly.</v>

1973
01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:17.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You teach your kids eat healthy or is it</v>

1974
01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:21.210
<v Speaker 4>just kind of like they just watch a</v>
<v Speaker 4>night kind of like off of everything.</v>

1975
01:20:21.211 --> 01:20:24.150
<v Speaker 4>It's really unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been eating from the time they</v>

1976
01:20:24.151 --> 01:20:28.950
<v Speaker 4>were really little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started hunting in 2012 so for the</v>

1977
01:20:28.951 --> 01:20:31.560
<v Speaker 4>last six years they've been eating wild</v>
<v Speaker 4>game.</v>

1978
01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:34.230
<v Speaker 4>So from the time they were little,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like my seven year old,</v>

1979
01:20:34.231 --> 01:20:37.620
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't know anything different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's eaten beef for sure.</v>

1980
01:20:37.621 --> 01:20:39.600
<v Speaker 4>She eats hot dogs and normal stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 4>kids eat,</v>

1981
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:44.030
<v Speaker 4>but she's been eating elk and bear and</v>
<v Speaker 4>deer and you know,</v>

1982
01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:47.520
<v Speaker 4>Moose her whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's the wild Turkey.</v>

1983
01:20:47.521 --> 01:20:51.210
<v Speaker 4>She's eaten like basically all the</v>
<v Speaker 4>different things that people hunt for.</v>

1984
01:20:51.211 --> 01:20:52.740
<v Speaker 4>She's eaten since she was a little kid.</v>

1985
01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:55.050
<v Speaker 4>You guys talk about nutrition at all?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1986
01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:57.960
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the other thing that my kids eat</v>

1987
01:20:57.961 --> 01:21:01.200
<v Speaker 4>that's really spectacular to watch as</v>
<v Speaker 4>they love Kimchi,</v>

1988
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 4>especially my youngest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she loves probiotics,</v>

1989
01:21:03.691 --> 01:21:05.000
<v Speaker 4>which is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1990
01:21:05.010 --> 01:21:09.120
<v Speaker 4>We give them probiotics in supplements.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We give them probiotics and in terms of</v>

1991
01:21:09.121 --> 01:21:12.360
<v Speaker 4>yogurt and acidophilus and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and these little uh,</v>

1992
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:16.320
<v Speaker 4>Bio k formulas that are pretty rich and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they taste pretty good too.</v>

1993
01:21:16.321 --> 01:21:17.670
<v Speaker 4>There's some sugar in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately,</v>

1994
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:21.090
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but getting your kids into really</v>

1995
01:21:21.091 --> 01:21:24.120
<v Speaker 4>healthy probiotic foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's interesting.</v>

1996
01:21:24.121 --> 01:21:27.090
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting is how quickly they</v>
<v Speaker 4>snap back from colds,</v>

1997
01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:29.730
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how resistant they are to them and how</v>

1998
01:21:29.731 --> 01:21:33.180
<v Speaker 4>quickly they snap back for them because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have this healthy biome,</v>

1999
01:21:33.181 --> 01:21:35.490
<v Speaker 4>this healthy immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kimchi is one of my,</v>

2000
01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:38.160
<v Speaker 4>I had some Kimchi today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat it almost every day.</v>

2001
01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:40.970
<v Speaker 4>I get this a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a company called mother-in-laws</v>

2002
01:21:41.010 --> 01:21:44.100
<v Speaker 4>Kimchi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's my favorite and I'll buy like five</v>

2003
01:21:44.101 --> 01:21:47.130
<v Speaker 4>jars at a time and I go through those</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuckers in like two weeks.</v>

2004
01:21:47.150 --> 01:21:50.310
<v Speaker 4>You don't see it by itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came to you with meat most of the time</v>

2005
01:21:50.311 --> 01:21:53.520
<v Speaker 4>I'll slice meat and put Kimchi on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if the two of them together don't,</v>

2006
01:21:53.521 --> 01:21:55.340
<v Speaker 4>people bury that shit like in their</v>
<v Speaker 4>backyard.</v>

2007
01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:56.940
<v Speaker 4>Koreans do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:21:56.941 --> 01:21:59.420
<v Speaker 4>They make a pot and it ferments and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>bird in their bag,</v>

2009
01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:01.690
<v Speaker 1>it's really good for your gut</v>
<v Speaker 1>microbiome.</v>

2010
01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:05.050
<v Speaker 1>And the more we find out about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why I was saying like what I'm</v>

2011
01:22:05.051 --> 01:22:07.750
<v Speaker 1>doing is an intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to just eat meat forever.</v>

2012
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:08.663
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2013
01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:09.880
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next,</v>

2014
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:13.750
<v Speaker 1>the next step for me is once I get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point where I feel like I'm lean</v>

2015
01:22:13.751 --> 01:22:17.200
<v Speaker 1>enough to where I want to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still want to lose about 10 pounds.</v>

2016
01:22:17.290 --> 01:22:18.260
<v Speaker 1>And you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2017
01:22:18.261 --> 01:22:20.980
<v Speaker 1>I get leaner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lean still have a lot of belly fat</v>

2018
01:22:20.981 --> 01:22:25.780
<v Speaker 1>that's been around from my drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday for so the upper abs come in,</v>

2019
01:22:25.781 --> 01:22:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but then the lower abs is still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2020
01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we got out,</v>

2021
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:29.740
<v Speaker 1>we had tightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shut up.</v>

2022
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:31.640
<v Speaker 4>Other than Peter Luger going off the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rails,</v>

2023
01:22:31.641 --> 01:22:34.580
<v Speaker 4>I've been on a strict diet for two weeks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've lost five pounds.</v>

2024
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:38.360
<v Speaker 4>What's your diet?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which you just meat and vegetables.</v>

2025
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:39.290
<v Speaker 4>That's mostly it.</v>

2026
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And any sort of a rhyme or reason or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just eat as much as you want when you</v>

2027
01:22:42.721 --> 01:22:43.554
<v Speaker 1>want or,</v>

2028
01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:47.200
<v Speaker 4>I got a little fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got up to about 200 and that's what</v>

2029
01:22:47.201 --> 01:22:51.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm fat and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to be like right now I was one 94</v>

2030
01:22:51.101 --> 01:22:53.920
<v Speaker 4>after my run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some probably like one 96.</v>

2031
01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:56.130
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We weighed the same exact weight one 94</v>

2032
01:22:56.131 --> 01:22:56.700
<v Speaker 1>this morning.</v>

2033
01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just became best friends.</v>

2034
01:22:58.620 --> 01:22:59.860
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did we just become,</v>

2035
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.570
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to be,</v>

2036
01:23:01.571 --> 01:23:03.820
<v Speaker 4>I think if I'm really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm shredded,</v>

2037
01:23:03.821 --> 01:23:05.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm down at about one 90.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2038
01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm really,</v>

2039
01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 4>so I think I need,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could lose another four pounds.</v>

2040
01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.640
<v Speaker 4>I think being mindful as a key factor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that you're like I'm getting</v>

2041
01:23:12.641 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold yourself to a standard.</v>

2042
01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:17.740
<v Speaker 4>I tell people all the time try to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>made as something different.</v>

2043
01:23:17.770 --> 01:23:19.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only way I know how to like build</v>

2044
01:23:19.601 --> 01:23:20.320
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2045
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.830
<v Speaker 4>any self esteem or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>build up self respect or any of these</v>

2046
01:23:23.831 --> 01:23:25.900
<v Speaker 4>things is through training or through</v>
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>

2047
01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:28.510
<v Speaker 4>I can't really do it through a business</v>
<v Speaker 4>meeting.</v>

2048
01:23:28.511 --> 01:23:30.490
<v Speaker 4>I can't do it just through like reading</v>
<v Speaker 4>a book.</v>

2049
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:33.280
<v Speaker 4>You can get motivated by watching a</v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube video or something,</v>

2050
01:23:33.281 --> 01:23:36.160
<v Speaker 4>but that lasts you a couple hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it lasts you for the week.</v>

2051
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:38.260
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it helps point in the right</v>
<v Speaker 4>direction,</v>

2052
01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:40.390
<v Speaker 4>which is cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well the thing about it for martial</v>

2053
01:23:40.391 --> 01:23:42.640
<v Speaker 4>arts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially for striking is when you lose</v>

2054
01:23:42.641 --> 01:23:44.140
<v Speaker 4>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you move faster.</v>

2055
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.440
<v Speaker 4>It's like if I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I went out there and hit the bag and</v>

2056
01:23:47.441 --> 01:23:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I put a 40 pound weight vest on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>strap that fucker and I would feel</v>

2057
01:23:51.041 --> 01:23:52.780
<v Speaker 4>slower.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I just would,</v>

2058
01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:54.070
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way around it.</v>

2059
01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even 10 pounds makes a difference.</v>

2060
01:23:56.471 --> 01:23:58.270
<v Speaker 4>When I used to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that I noticed when I</v>

2061
01:23:58.271 --> 01:24:01.450
<v Speaker 4>would get down close to my weight class</v>
<v Speaker 4>is I just move quicker because I was</v>

2062
01:24:01.451 --> 01:24:03.370
<v Speaker 4>carrying around less weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt,</v>

2063
01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I was less to move around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my muscles are essentially as</v>

2064
01:24:07.271 --> 01:24:09.940
<v Speaker 4>strong and probably lost a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 4>muscle when you lose weight,</v>

2065
01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:14.830
<v Speaker 4>but most of it was there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but my body fat on my body weight was</v>

2066
01:24:14.831 --> 01:24:17.710
<v Speaker 4>down several pounds and I would just</v>
<v Speaker 4>move quicker.</v>

2067
01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.260
<v Speaker 4>You used to be tough as a fighter to</v>
<v Speaker 4>gauge that too though.</v>

2068
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:23.020
<v Speaker 4>Like when you lose too much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like maybe like one almost wanting to</v>

2069
01:24:23.021 --> 01:24:25.230
<v Speaker 4>avoid food to feel faster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

2070
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:29.620
<v Speaker 4>You see that with a lot of UFC fighters</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they get down too low in weight,</v>

2071
01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:31.270
<v Speaker 4>they just can't perform properly and</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2072
01:24:31.271 --> 01:24:32.890
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think there's a real issue with</v>

2073
01:24:32.891 --> 01:24:35.980
<v Speaker 4>MMA and that issue is there's not enough</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight classes.</v>

2074
01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:38.650
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're very,</v>

2075
01:24:38.651 --> 01:24:42.610
<v Speaker 4>very strongly about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's giant gaps like one 85</v>

2076
01:24:42.611 --> 01:24:46.180
<v Speaker 4>to two oh five drives me fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a 20 that's a gap.</v>

2077
01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:50.230
<v Speaker 4>That's a tough area to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because guys can be so muscular that</v>

2078
01:24:50.231 --> 01:24:52.040
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or skinny I it does it.</v>

2079
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:53.950
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really how tall they are,</v>

2080
01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.050
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's really like what is your</v>

2081
01:24:56.051 --> 01:25:00.190
<v Speaker 4>optimal and the idea that people would</v>
<v Speaker 4>fit in between that 20 pounds optimal</v>

2082
01:25:00.191 --> 01:25:01.480
<v Speaker 4>either this way or that way.</v>

2083
01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.550
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy because those two oh five</v>
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>

2084
01:25:03.551 --> 01:25:05.590
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them could be heavyweights like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones.</v>

2085
01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 4>Jon Jones could be the heavyweight</v>
<v Speaker 4>champion of the world.</v>

2086
01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:11.470
<v Speaker 4>100% no doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no fucking doubt about it.</v>

2087
01:25:11.471 --> 01:25:13.480
<v Speaker 4>Yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's still in ways two oh five when he</v>

2088
01:25:13.481 --> 01:25:15.310
<v Speaker 4>fights and he doesn't have a hard time</v>
<v Speaker 4>making that weight.</v>

2089
01:25:15.550 --> 01:25:19.240
<v Speaker 4>Now if you're a guy like say Hector</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lombard,</v>

2090
01:25:19.330 --> 01:25:22.660
<v Speaker 4>who's fought at one 70 and just really</v>
<v Speaker 4>packs a lot of meat on,</v>

2091
01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:27.130
<v Speaker 4>and he fights it one 85 you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he fights at one 85 he could,</v>

2092
01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:31.270
<v Speaker 4>he's also fought at two oh five before I</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe if he decided to fight it one at</v>

2093
01:25:31.271 --> 01:25:35.890
<v Speaker 4>two Oh five and John Jones decides to</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight it to a five I mean hector's my</v>

2094
01:25:35.891 --> 01:25:39.790
<v Speaker 4>height and Jon Jones towers over me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're looking at just a totally</v>

2095
01:25:39.791 --> 01:25:43.420
<v Speaker 4>different body size and totally</v>
<v Speaker 4>different frame that 20 pounds is too</v>

2096
01:25:43.421 --> 01:25:44.254
<v Speaker 4>much man.</v>

2097
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:46.450
<v Speaker 4>And then from two oh five to</v>
<v Speaker 4>heavyweight,</v>

2098
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.090
<v Speaker 4>you could get some brock Lesnar</v>
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker that or Francis and Ghana</v>

2099
01:25:50.091 --> 01:25:53.890
<v Speaker 4>who has to cut weight to make two 65</v>
<v Speaker 4>frances even more impressive.</v>

2100
01:25:53.891 --> 01:25:55.540
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he's natural.</v>

2101
01:25:55.690 --> 01:25:58.090
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not even barely lifting weights.</v>

2102
01:25:58.300 --> 01:26:01.710
<v Speaker 4>I mean that guy is just a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic super athlete.</v>

2103
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:04.010
<v Speaker 4>So that guy doesn't really lift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2104
01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:04.911
<v Speaker 4>it's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge.</v>

2105
01:26:04.911 --> 01:26:08.420
<v Speaker 4>He got that big from working in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking sand mine.</v>

2106
01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:09.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is,</v>

2107
01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:12.230
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he literally is like Conan the barbarian</v>

2108
01:26:12.231 --> 01:26:14.210
<v Speaker 4>from the Robert E.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Howard Nigerian.</v>

2109
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.270
<v Speaker 4>He is from Cameroon I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2110
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:20.180
<v Speaker 4>I think that's where he's from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2111
01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:25.181
<v Speaker 4>there's videos of him on his instagram</v>
<v Speaker 4>from yesterday of him back in the same</v>

2112
01:26:25.971 --> 01:26:30.500
<v Speaker 4>sand mine and he's wearing his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>Reebok Jersey with his name on the back</v>

2113
01:26:30.501 --> 01:26:32.780
<v Speaker 4>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>digging sand with all the guys who used</v>

2114
01:26:32.781 --> 01:26:33.614
<v Speaker 4>to work with.</v>

2115
01:26:33.740 --> 01:26:38.720
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that is hard labor and it's,</v>

2116
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:40.820
<v Speaker 4>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do that all day.</v>

2117
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:44.960
<v Speaker 4>Dig fucking stand all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know how fucking strong you had been</v>

2118
01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:50.290
<v Speaker 4>just carrying 20 pound hunks of sand and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoving them into the top of that truck</v>

2119
01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:52.790
<v Speaker 4>all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a beast.</v>

2120
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Well he's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's got tremendous genetics.</v>

2121
01:26:55.791 --> 01:26:58.610
<v Speaker 4>His father has built a chem two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a picture of him on his</v>

2122
01:26:58.611 --> 01:27:02.180
<v Speaker 4>instagram when he was three years old</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing next to his father and you look</v>

2123
01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:03.770
<v Speaker 4>at his daddy like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus,</v>

2124
01:27:03.771 --> 01:27:06.230
<v Speaker 4>like the apple on the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are baby.</v>

2125
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.480
<v Speaker 4>You think he's going to be pretty</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous coming up?</v>

2126
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:11.630
<v Speaker 4>Like the only issue with Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his wrestling and his uh,</v>

2127
01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:14.030
<v Speaker 4>in his endurance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is just based on his fight with</v>

2128
01:27:14.031 --> 01:27:17.150
<v Speaker 4>steep emile chick who in my opinion is</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best heavy weight ever.</v>

2129
01:27:17.330 --> 01:27:20.540
<v Speaker 4>I think if you look at what Steve Pays</v>
<v Speaker 4>managed to do in his career,</v>

2130
01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:22.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's defended the title more than</v>

2131
01:27:22.281 --> 01:27:22.940
<v Speaker 4>anybody.</v>

2132
01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.370
<v Speaker 4>He knocked out for breezy over Dune was</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the best ever.</v>

2133
01:27:25.371 --> 01:27:28.770
<v Speaker 4>He knocked out Alistair Overeem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he beat Francis and Ghana who everybody</v>

2134
01:27:28.771 --> 01:27:32.060
<v Speaker 4>was fucking terrified of and Francis</v>
<v Speaker 4>been blowing everybody out of the water,</v>

2135
01:27:32.061 --> 01:27:36.110
<v Speaker 4>including Alistair overeem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think and knocked out junior dos</v>

2136
01:27:36.111 --> 01:27:37.700
<v Speaker 4>Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>also former heavyweight champion.</v>

2137
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:41.630
<v Speaker 4>I think Steve pays the best of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you know,</v>

2138
01:27:41.710 --> 01:27:45.590
<v Speaker 4>Steve [inaudible] is able to beat you</v>
<v Speaker 4>and beat you by using his wrestling and</v>

2139
01:27:45.591 --> 01:27:49.490
<v Speaker 4>using his smarts and using his,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his octagon intelligence and just his</v>

2140
01:27:49.491 --> 01:27:51.800
<v Speaker 4>overall fight Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just knows how to fight better.</v>

2141
01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:57.100
<v Speaker 4>He's just got more tools in the toolbox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Frances can learn and he's an incredible</v>

2142
01:27:57.261 --> 01:28:01.040
<v Speaker 4>athlete and what he has over everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his power,</v>

2143
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.610
<v Speaker 4>he has more power in his punch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a machine out there called the</v>

2144
01:28:04.611 --> 01:28:09.320
<v Speaker 4>power cube and that machine Francis</v>
<v Speaker 4>registered the highest ever power punch</v>

2145
01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.960
<v Speaker 4>by like 10,000 units,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck that means.</v>

2146
01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.810
<v Speaker 4>So tyrone spong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's a super powerful heavyweight</v>

2147
01:28:14.811 --> 01:28:17.980
<v Speaker 4>boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he scored like one 19 I think it was an</v>

2148
01:28:17.981 --> 01:28:22.981
<v Speaker 4>f or one 14 and then Francis scored</v>
<v Speaker 4>1209209000 and you see it when he hits</v>

2149
01:28:25.701 --> 01:28:27.260
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's about what you kick,</v>

2150
01:28:27.261 --> 01:28:28.820
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get your check a little bit more</v>

2151
01:28:28.821 --> 01:28:29.630
<v Speaker 4>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's,</v>

2152
01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:33.860
<v Speaker 4>I kicked in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hold the record right now until</v>

2153
01:28:33.861 --> 01:28:37.340
<v Speaker 4>somebody beats ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll hold the red one 5,252 from a</v>

2154
01:28:37.341 --> 01:28:37.820
<v Speaker 4>kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2155
01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:40.250
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the size of my leg,</v>

2156
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.570
<v Speaker 4>like carrying around 196 pounds all day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>running hills with 196 pounds.</v>

2157
01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.930
<v Speaker 4>Try,</v>
<v Speaker 4>try doing fucking handstands and running</v>

2158
01:28:47.931 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 4>up a hill with handstands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just can't,</v>

2159
01:28:49.731 --> 01:28:52.280
<v Speaker 4>you're arms are not that strong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also,</v>

2160
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:54.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been kicking my whole life,</v>

2161
01:28:54.081 --> 01:28:56.300
<v Speaker 4>he's really only been training him in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maine for five years.</v>

2162
01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he's just,</v>

2163
01:28:57.561 --> 01:28:58.490
<v Speaker 4>he's fun to watch.</v>

2164
01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.100
<v Speaker 4>He's amazing to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a old Tyson fight.</v>

2165
01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:02.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the match,</v>

2166
01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.770
<v Speaker 4>even a fight with us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve Bay was kind of scary cause he</v>

2167
01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:06.090
<v Speaker 4>just kept getting back up and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2168
01:29:06.210 --> 01:29:08.970
<v Speaker 4>it was like watching now Mike Myers like</v>
<v Speaker 4>a horror movie or something.</v>

2169
01:29:08.971 --> 01:29:11.610
<v Speaker 4>Michael Myers and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Freddy Kruger or something just kept</v>

2170
01:29:11.611 --> 01:29:13.210
<v Speaker 4>coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have the wrestling</v>

2171
01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:15.270
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have the wrestling technique.</v>

2172
01:29:15.330 --> 01:29:20.330
<v Speaker 4>But what he has is a incredible heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>and desire and he's very hungry to</v>

2173
01:29:20.371 --> 01:29:21.550
<v Speaker 4>learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm,</v>

2174
01:29:21.551 --> 01:29:24.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm very hopeful that he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 4>learn and you know,</v>

2175
01:29:24.001 --> 01:29:26.610
<v Speaker 4>and I really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really hope that he incorporates,</v>

2176
01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:30.030
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of real rigorous wrestling program</v>

2177
01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:32.160
<v Speaker 4>because that was one thing that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>lacking from his last,</v>

2178
01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the last training camp when he</v>

2179
01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 4>fought for steep pen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you have seen needs a 300 and up</v>

2180
01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:37.771
<v Speaker 4>club,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

2181
01:29:37.771 --> 01:29:38.221
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2182
01:29:38.221 --> 01:29:40.370
<v Speaker 4>to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have that weight class and then have him</v>

2183
01:29:40.371 --> 01:29:42.690
<v Speaker 4>only fight for a minute and rest for</v>
<v Speaker 4>like five minutes.</v>

2184
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:45.240
<v Speaker 4>Well there's nothing I issue is there's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not enough fighters.</v>

2185
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:46.980
<v Speaker 4>There's not enough guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2186
01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:49.470
<v Speaker 4>but not enough big boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2187
01:29:49.471 --> 01:29:54.130
<v Speaker 4>Maybe you just like put,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw it on the back burner for up to</v>

2188
01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:56.520
<v Speaker 4>65 and I'm going to do whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want.</v>

2189
01:29:56.630 --> 01:29:58.140
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2191
01:29:59.490 --> 01:30:02.310

<v Speaker 4>I'm hopeful that Francis still,</v>

2192
01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:06.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a little older in terms of like</v>

2193
01:30:06.031 --> 01:30:09.050
<v Speaker 4>being this new to the sport at 33,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2194
01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:11.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really didn't even start training</v>

2195
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:12.220
<v Speaker 4>until he was 28.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2196
01:30:12.221 --> 01:30:13.710
<v Speaker 4>he's kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was homeless.</v>

2197
01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's like right out of a movie.</v>

2199
01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:22.410
<v Speaker 4>The guy was homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>came from Africa where he worked in a</v>

2200
01:30:22.411 --> 01:30:27.411
<v Speaker 4>fucking sand mine and then gets to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>number one contender spot in the UFC.</v>

2201
01:30:28.500 --> 01:30:30.420
<v Speaker 4>But there's guys now,</v>

<v Speaker 4>this is a giant guy.</v>

2208
01:30:44.130 --> 01:30:46.710
<v Speaker 4>Like he's a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think he's six,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that are like at the higher end of the</v>

2212
01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:56.670
<v Speaker 4>way class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you say his last name?</v>

2213
01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:00.300
<v Speaker 4>Volkov right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I W I always get confused because</v>

2214
01:31:00.301 --> 01:31:05.301
<v Speaker 4>Russians say things with Russian accent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was under the vocal vocal Volkov is</v>

2215
01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:10.380
<v Speaker 4>find out if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he that tall.</v>

2216
01:31:10.890 --> 01:31:11.790
<v Speaker 4>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's six,</v>

2217
01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:12.570
<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2218
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:17.370
<v Speaker 4>He's a incredibly long and efficient and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has real power.</v>

2219
01:31:17.700 --> 01:31:19.320
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's hard to hit man,</v>

2220
01:31:19.321 --> 01:31:24.321
<v Speaker 4>but his game is so well rounded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference between him and a guy</v>

2221
01:31:25.261 --> 01:31:26.640
<v Speaker 4>likes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2222
01:31:26.641 --> 01:31:27.480
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2223
01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.670
<v Speaker 4>Francis is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not new to the game.</v>

2224
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:33.420
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a giant guy who's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting for a long fucking time,</v>

2225
01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:36.240
<v Speaker 4>so he is a real efficient martial</v>
<v Speaker 4>artists.</v>

2226
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:41.020
<v Speaker 4>When he fought Fabrizio Verdon I could</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell early on the striking exchanges</v>

2227
01:31:41.070 --> 01:31:41.903
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2228
01:31:42.010 --> 01:31:44.210
<v Speaker 4>fabrizio might be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this guy is,</v>

2229
01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:46.470
<v Speaker 4>he's long,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he knows that the stay on the outside</v>

2230
01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:50.520
<v Speaker 4>and he knows he's got an excellent sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>of distance and he's got legit knockout</v>

2231
01:31:50.570 --> 01:31:52.650
<v Speaker 4>power and he fucked fabrizio up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2232
01:31:52.651 --> 01:31:54.360
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was hard to watch.</v>

2233
01:31:54.361 --> 01:31:55.350
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2234
01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:56.820
<v Speaker 4>this guy's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's legit.</v>

2235
01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:59.470
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These longer body types have been so</v>

2236
01:31:59.471 --> 01:32:01.720
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Silva Bounce Jones.</v>

2237
01:32:01.721 --> 01:32:03.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these guys have,</v>

2238
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't think that,</v>

2239
01:32:05.651 --> 01:32:07.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd think someone may be shorter</v>

2240
01:32:07.091 --> 01:32:10.240
<v Speaker 4>stockier and getting the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But did he seize up long?</v>

2241
01:32:10.241 --> 01:32:15.241
<v Speaker 4>Seems like a huge beat Saturday night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sharapov say that five times fast.</v>

2242
01:32:16.361 --> 01:32:18.340
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well before we came on the podcast,</v>

2243
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:22.630
<v Speaker 4>as soon as he came on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going six to one 45 you can find a</v>

2244
01:32:22.631 --> 01:32:23.680
<v Speaker 4>skinnier guy I thought.</v>

2245
01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.770
<v Speaker 4>And then I saw him fight and man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was just so impressive.</v>

2246
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:31.720
<v Speaker 4>But fast and strong live at one 45 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>six two I guess voice was,</v>

2247
01:32:31.721 --> 01:32:33.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't real tall but he was like six</v>

2248
01:32:33.491 --> 01:32:35.840
<v Speaker 4>one right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he was one 75 mm.</v>

2249
01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:37.810
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was obviously fighting in the</v>

2250
01:32:37.811 --> 01:32:40.750
<v Speaker 4>unlimited class and he was fighting guys</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Dan Severn at the time.</v>

2251
01:32:40.751 --> 01:32:44.930
<v Speaker 4>It was two 65 feet is thin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's got muscle on him if he's kind</v>

2252
01:32:44.931 --> 01:32:46.810
<v Speaker 4>of jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when you looked at it like a</v>

2253
01:32:46.811 --> 01:32:48.500
<v Speaker 4>perfect frame.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's all almost awesome,</v>

2254
01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:50.920
<v Speaker 4>a little tiny luke rockhold and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways,</v>

2255
01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.610
<v Speaker 4>but with a way more dynamic game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He could do everything.</v>

2256
01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:56.290
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was really interesting to watch this</v>

2257
01:32:56.291 --> 01:32:59.830
<v Speaker 4>first time I ever saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fight Dot guy is fucking phenomenal.</v>

2258
01:32:59.831 --> 01:33:02.230
<v Speaker 4>He's so talented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the first time I saw him fight</v>

2259
01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:05.290
<v Speaker 4>live and it's a different thing when you</v>
<v Speaker 4>see someone live.</v>

2260
01:33:05.290 --> 01:33:06.760
<v Speaker 4>Like if you see someone in a video and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go,</v>

2261
01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:07.720
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's good.</v>

2262
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:10.360
<v Speaker 4>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see him live and you know your brain</v>

2263
01:33:10.361 --> 01:33:13.920
<v Speaker 4>has like a little computer where it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>seen or you know you've got,</v>

2264
01:33:13.930 --> 01:33:15.820
<v Speaker 4>they've got a database,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially me,</v>

2265
01:33:15.850 --> 01:33:19.720
<v Speaker 4>I've seen so many fights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a database of how people move and</v>

2266
01:33:19.721 --> 01:33:21.010
<v Speaker 4>then you see that guy moving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

2267
01:33:21.011 --> 01:33:23.470
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are we looking at here?</v>

2268
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:26.710
<v Speaker 4>Because I love seeing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love seeing this next level shit,</v>

2269
01:33:26.711 --> 01:33:29.500
<v Speaker 4>that next level thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like whether it's you know,</v>

2270
01:33:29.501 --> 01:33:32.620
<v Speaker 4>connor or whether it's a tyron woodley</v>
<v Speaker 4>or these,</v>

2271
01:33:32.621 --> 01:33:34.540
<v Speaker 4>every now and then you see next level</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you go,</v>

2272
01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:36.880
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like tyron woodley to me.</v>

2273
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:41.500
<v Speaker 4>He fought Carlos condit and there was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>moment in the condit fight where he</v>

2274
01:33:41.501 --> 01:33:44.590
<v Speaker 4>stepped forward and snap Carlos with a a</v>
<v Speaker 4>straight right hand.</v>

2275
01:33:44.591 --> 01:33:45.580
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2276
01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:47.830
<v Speaker 4>that's like 10% faster than it should</v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

2277
01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:48.741
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you,</v>

2278
01:33:48.741 --> 01:33:53.650
<v Speaker 4>you get used to world class athletes</v>
<v Speaker 4>moving and then you see someone like</v>

2279
01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:56.230
<v Speaker 4>Edson Barboza switch kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's another one.</v>

2280
01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:57.370
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2281
01:33:57.400 --> 01:33:58.930

<v Speaker 4>You know.</v>

2282
01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:04.050
<v Speaker 4>But to me the biggest example that is</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nurburg of madoff's wrestling Khabib</v>

2283
01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:05.380
<v Speaker 4>takes how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my God,</v>

2284
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:07.720
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody who's good,</v>

2285
01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.490
<v Speaker 4>how failed though?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,</v>

2286
01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:10.630
<v Speaker 4>black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 4>world champion,</v>

2287
01:34:10.930 --> 01:34:13.660
<v Speaker 4>rag dolls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rag dolls,</v>

2288
01:34:13.661 --> 01:34:15.220
<v Speaker 4>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Johnson.</v>

2289
01:34:15.221 --> 01:34:17.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no matter who he fights,</v>

2290
01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:20.710
<v Speaker 4>he ragdolled this guy in the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I thought it was over right away.</v>

2291
01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:21.101
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2292
01:34:21.101 --> 01:34:23.710
<v Speaker 4>this is over and that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I can't say did,</v>

2293
01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:25.900
<v Speaker 4>did really well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did very well.</v>

2294
01:34:25.901 --> 01:34:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Very well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing about higher quinta is he's a</v>

2295
01:34:28.241 --> 01:34:31.210
<v Speaker 4>legit crazy person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that guy's crazy.</v>

2296
01:34:31.211 --> 01:34:33.040
<v Speaker 4>He trashes hotel rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2297
01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:34.780
<v Speaker 4>you look at his eyes like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2298
01:34:34.781 --> 01:34:36.130
<v Speaker 4>there's only like a's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>

2299
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:37.690
<v Speaker 4>a couple of people home.</v>

2300
01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.830
<v Speaker 4>It's not a full village in that head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a good example.</v>

2301
01:34:41.831 --> 01:34:45.580
<v Speaker 4>But what I'm saying like he's a legit</v>
<v Speaker 4>maniac and he's not scared.</v>

2302
01:34:45.610 --> 01:34:48.070
<v Speaker 4>Like he'll fight anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you could wake him up at three</v>

2303
01:34:48.071 --> 01:34:51.250
<v Speaker 4>o'clock in the morning and he'll fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody made crazy thing.</v>

2304
01:34:51.370 --> 01:34:54.970
<v Speaker 4>He was screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was running around the hotel lobby</v>

2305
01:34:54.971 --> 01:34:58.340
<v Speaker 4>the day when,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we found out Max Holloway could not</v>

2306
01:34:58.341 --> 01:34:59.770
<v Speaker 4>make weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the new,</v>

2307
01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.820
<v Speaker 4>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I shouldn't say could not make weight.</v>

2308
01:35:02.030 --> 01:35:04.760
<v Speaker 4>I believe Max would have made the way</v>
<v Speaker 4>they did in New York State Athletic</v>

2309
01:35:04.761 --> 01:35:06.950
<v Speaker 4>Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they made some,</v>

2310
01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:11.450
<v Speaker 4>they made some big errors and I can go</v>
<v Speaker 4>into detail with a couple of them.</v>

2311
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:13.520
<v Speaker 4>One of them is they wouldn't let Paul</v>
<v Speaker 4>felder fight.</v>

2312
01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:15.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul felder wanted to fight.</v>

2313
01:35:15.441 --> 01:35:19.640
<v Speaker 4>They said he's not ranked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul felder is a fucking killer.</v>

2314
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:21.410
<v Speaker 4>He is a straight up killer.</v>

2315
01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.820
<v Speaker 4>And him versus Khabib would have been a</v>
<v Speaker 4>very interesting fight because Paul is a</v>

2316
01:35:25.821 --> 01:35:30.170
<v Speaker 4>big one 55.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's very big and very strong and he is</v>

2317
01:35:30.171 --> 01:35:34.640
<v Speaker 4>an expert world class striker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean Paul felder is a dangerous,</v>

2318
01:35:34.641 --> 01:35:38.570
<v Speaker 4>dangerous man for anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In 155 pounds and he's a grounded pound</v>

2319
01:35:38.571 --> 01:35:41.570
<v Speaker 4>expert.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's also get very good defense in,</v>

2320
01:35:41.571 --> 01:35:42.890
<v Speaker 4>in everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good defense,</v>

2321
01:35:42.891 --> 01:35:44.750
<v Speaker 4>standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very good defense on the ground.</v>

2322
01:35:44.751 --> 01:35:47.990
<v Speaker 4>He felt his fucking well rounded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have been very intrigued in that</v>

2323
01:35:47.991 --> 01:35:51.020
<v Speaker 4>fight and they offered it to felder fell</v>
<v Speaker 4>this had fuck.</v>

2324
01:35:51.021 --> 01:35:52.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then in Nevada state or the,</v>

2325
01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:54.170
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York State Athletic Commission said,</v>

2326
01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:56.780
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys are out of your fucking minds.</v>

2327
01:35:56.781 --> 01:35:59.210
<v Speaker 4>You don't know shit about fighting if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't think that guy could fight for</v>

2328
01:35:59.211 --> 01:36:02.090
<v Speaker 4>the title because Paul might be fighting</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the title in a year from now or</v>

2329
01:36:02.091 --> 01:36:02.690
<v Speaker 4>whenever.</v>

2330
01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:05.600
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's fucking world class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the fact that they don't know that</v>

2331
01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:06.321
<v Speaker 4>and they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2332
01:36:06.321 --> 01:36:08.570
<v Speaker 4>based on the rankings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rankings are horse shit.</v>

2333
01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.420
<v Speaker 4>They're arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're made by a bunch of people that I</v>

2334
01:36:11.421 --> 01:36:14.030
<v Speaker 4>think a lot of times they're biased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have terrible judgment.</v>

2335
01:36:14.150 --> 01:36:18.050
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes the guy will fuck a guy up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you look at the rankings and he's</v>

2336
01:36:18.051 --> 01:36:20.240
<v Speaker 4>below that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just fucked up in the rankings.</v>

2337
01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:24.020
<v Speaker 4>Explain that there was no other way to</v>
<v Speaker 4>tell if a guy's better than who we</v>

2338
01:36:24.021 --> 01:36:25.190
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they say,</v>

2339
01:36:25.191 --> 01:36:28.130
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was past experience suck fat dicks.</v>

2340
01:36:28.930 --> 01:36:30.710
<v Speaker 4>That past experience doesn't mean</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

2341
01:36:30.770 --> 01:36:33.770
<v Speaker 4>This guy just date,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy beat the guy who beat the guy.</v>

2342
01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.810
<v Speaker 4>That guy beat him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well if he was number one,</v>

2343
01:36:35.900 --> 01:36:37.820
<v Speaker 4>now he's number one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how it goes.</v>

2344
01:36:37.940 --> 01:36:39.860
<v Speaker 4>You can't get knocked out and still be</v>
<v Speaker 4>number one.</v>

2345
01:36:39.860 --> 01:36:42.680
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this is often the case when you see</v>

2346
01:36:42.681 --> 01:36:45.680
<v Speaker 4>a guy beat a guy and he's still below</v>
<v Speaker 4>the guy in the rank.</v>

2347
01:36:45.681 --> 01:36:47.930
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck else can he do?</v>

2348
01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:51.140
<v Speaker 4>How did you end up with the guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How did they end up getting I</v>

2349
01:36:51.141 --> 01:36:52.550
<v Speaker 4>acquainted?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then they just asked him.</v>

2350
01:36:52.551 --> 01:36:53.990
<v Speaker 4>He was in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was the next guy in line.</v>

2351
01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:58.190
<v Speaker 4>He's on a four or five fight win streak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2352
01:36:58.330 --> 01:37:01.010
<v Speaker 4>and he's beaten some very good guys like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jorge Mosfet doll,</v>

2353
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:02.270
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ross Pearson.</v>

2354
01:37:02.271 --> 01:37:03.920
<v Speaker 4>He's beaten some legit guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2355
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:06.590
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Quinta can bang and he's tough as shit</v>

2356
01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:09.440
<v Speaker 4>and he's got a wrestling background,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I think played a big factor in</v>

2357
01:37:09.441 --> 01:37:13.190
<v Speaker 4>that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obviously he was greatly outclass by a</v>

2358
01:37:13.191 --> 01:37:15.890
<v Speaker 4>guy who I think is one of the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 4>lightweight of all time.</v>

2359
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:19.010
<v Speaker 4>And now that he's the champion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very interested in seeing.</v>

2360
01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:23.060
<v Speaker 4>But I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what we saw in that fight that was very</v>

2361
01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:27.160
<v Speaker 4>intriguing was the fact that I acquaint</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was able to get back up and that I</v>

2362
01:37:27.161 --> 01:37:30.230
<v Speaker 4>quit was one of the few guys that number</v>
<v Speaker 4>go madoff has ever fought,</v>

2363
01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:34.040
<v Speaker 4>that has stuffed a bunch of take downs</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then into the late rounds.</v>

2364
01:37:34.041 --> 01:37:37.760
<v Speaker 4>And this is a guy in owl that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>even prepare for a five round fight.</v>

2365
01:37:38.030 --> 01:37:40.190
<v Speaker 4>He was getting ready for a three round</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight with Paul felder.</v>

2366
01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:43.040
<v Speaker 4>So I mean fucking props to ally La</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quinta.</v>

2367
01:37:43.041 --> 01:37:44.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean fucking animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great job.</v>

2368
01:37:45.230 --> 01:37:50.230
<v Speaker 4>I was off animal and major props to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>could that Kyle Bochniac kit that</v>

2369
01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:55.331
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] beat that kid and savage</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause he ate everything.</v>

2370
01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:57.330
<v Speaker 4>He was smiling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>punched in the face,</v>

2371
01:37:57.331 --> 01:38:02.130
<v Speaker 4>smiling and coming off the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight and the three rounds of a clinic,</v>

2372
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:03.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's a beat put on a clinic.</v>

2373
01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:04.560
<v Speaker 4>He did everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>jumped,</v>

2374
01:38:04.561 --> 01:38:06.650
<v Speaker 4>spinning back kicks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>roundhouse tricks,</v>

2375
01:38:06.651 --> 01:38:08.850
<v Speaker 4>switch kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He hit him with a switch kick.</v>

2376
01:38:08.851 --> 01:38:13.380
<v Speaker 4>There was like Jesus Bochniac took a</v>
<v Speaker 4>couple to the neck rack and still kept</v>

2377
01:38:13.381 --> 01:38:16.050
<v Speaker 4>calm and still kept common blood coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of his nose,</v>

2378
01:38:16.051 --> 01:38:18.870
<v Speaker 4>his mouth stickin Freemason,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sticking his tongue out on him.</v>

2379
01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.250
<v Speaker 4>And then as a beat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2380
01:38:20.251 --> 01:38:22.230
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck do I got to do to this</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy?</v>

2381
01:38:22.410 --> 01:38:23.610
<v Speaker 4>At the end of it blocked me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>acts,</v>

2382
01:38:23.620 --> 01:38:26.970
<v Speaker 4>got him pinned up against the cage and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's throwing bombs and was crazy.</v>

2383
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.330
<v Speaker 4>The whole place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The entire Barclay Center on their feet.</v>

2384
01:38:31.050 --> 01:38:31.883
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stood up,</v>

2385
01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.950
<v Speaker 4>I was screaming and cop and it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>phenomenal.</v>

2386
01:38:35.010 --> 01:38:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I love,</v>

2387
01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:38.850
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was in my mind,</v>

2388
01:38:38.851 --> 01:38:41.520
<v Speaker 4>that was worth the price of admission</v>
<v Speaker 4>for the whole paper with your car,</v>

2389
01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:43.380
<v Speaker 4>just to see who's the best fight for</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2390
01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2391
01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:48.450
<v Speaker 4>But to see our do that just shows you</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2392
01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:52.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Al is a legit worldclass fighter.</v>

2393
01:38:52.021 --> 01:38:53.730
<v Speaker 4>You mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Definitely is not on the level of could</v>

2394
01:38:53.731 --> 01:38:55.170
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody thought he was coming in.</v>

2395
01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:56.243
<v Speaker 4>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2396
01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:58.680
<v Speaker 4>in a lot of ways an upset,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just the fact that he was able to go to</v>

2397
01:38:58.681 --> 01:39:02.640
<v Speaker 4>the distance and you see what could be</v>
<v Speaker 4>did to so many other fighters mean he</v>

2398
01:39:02.641 --> 01:39:06.540
<v Speaker 4>mall different else and he mauled out</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a lot of the fight.</v>

2399
01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.561
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

2400
01:39:07.561 --> 01:39:10.830
<v Speaker 4>the guy's the best wrestler at one 55</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

2401
01:39:11.070 --> 01:39:11.903
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever.</v>

2402
01:39:12.090 --> 01:39:16.740
<v Speaker 4>He does things to worldclass guys that</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you just confused because he's</v>

2403
01:39:16.741 --> 01:39:18.930
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like there's certain guys that are</v>

2404
01:39:18.931 --> 01:39:22.380
<v Speaker 4>doing things like ya year Rodriguez is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect example.</v>

2405
01:39:22.381 --> 01:39:26.040
<v Speaker 4>He does wild shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does like jump three 60 roundhouse</v>

2406
01:39:26.041 --> 01:39:28.650
<v Speaker 4>kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He threesixty roundhouse kicks Bj Penn</v>

2407
01:39:28.651 --> 01:39:31.020
<v Speaker 4>and the fate and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

2408
01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.420
<v Speaker 4>So this is like a guy doing something to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other guy with the other guy.</v>

2409
01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:36.600
<v Speaker 4>Just can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't move that way.</v>

2410
01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:39.690
<v Speaker 4>Number of Madoff is doing standard</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

2411
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:44.490
<v Speaker 4>but he's doing it at such a high level</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he'd makes world class fighters,</v>

2412
01:39:44.640 --> 01:39:47.430
<v Speaker 4>questioned their career.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He takes them in malls,</v>

2413
01:39:47.431 --> 01:39:50.190
<v Speaker 4>them and they have a different sense of</v>
<v Speaker 4>where they fit in the universe.</v>

2414
01:39:50.610 --> 01:39:53.310
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy to see somebody come back</v>
<v Speaker 4>from that when they're getting the shit</v>

2415
01:39:53.311 --> 01:39:55.020
<v Speaker 4>beat out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're getting hit so hard.</v>

2416
01:39:55.021 --> 01:39:56.250
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what makes you,</v>

2417
01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.730
<v Speaker 4>and I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had some fighters and stuff that,</v>

2418
01:39:58.731 --> 01:40:03.510
<v Speaker 4>that I've talked to you in the past and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times they don't even know that</v>

2419
01:40:03.511 --> 01:40:07.620
<v Speaker 4>how fucking bat shit crazy they are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did pro wrestling for for a handful of</v>

2420
01:40:07.621 --> 01:40:10.920
<v Speaker 4>years and when I was wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of times we'd share the ring and</v>

2421
01:40:10.950 --> 01:40:15.090
<v Speaker 4>so on and a lot of times like the UFC</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters,</v>

2422
01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:17.520
<v Speaker 4>they would say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you guys are fucking crazy.</v>

2423
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 4>What are you guys doing in there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking jumping off the top rope.</v>

2424
01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:21.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're crazy with the fit.</v>

2425
01:40:21.041 --> 01:40:22.800
<v Speaker 4>You're doing fucking out of this world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2426
01:40:22.801 --> 01:40:24.990
<v Speaker 4>I've goofed around about pro wrestling</v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

2427
01:40:24.991 --> 01:40:26.540
<v Speaker 4>but my honest feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

2428
01:40:26.580 --> 01:40:29.400
<v Speaker 4>all bullshit aside.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the toughest professions</v>

2429
01:40:29.401 --> 01:40:30.530
<v Speaker 4>in all of entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Udl.</v>

2430
01:40:30.780 --> 01:40:32.670
<v Speaker 4>It is unbelievably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is gay though.</v>

2431
01:40:32.671 --> 01:40:35.350
<v Speaker 4>That's why I was in it just for the gay</v>
<v Speaker 4>style.</v>

2432
01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:36.870
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not,</v>

2433
01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2434
01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:40.320
<v Speaker 4>it's not a sport,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's entertainment,</v>

2435
01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:44.010
<v Speaker 4>but you have to be incredibly athletic</v>
<v Speaker 4>to do some shit they do.</v>

2436
01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:47.100
<v Speaker 4>And the beating those guys take this in</v>
<v Speaker 4>terms of their body,</v>

2437
01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:49.350
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's very underappreciated cause you</v>

2438
01:40:49.351 --> 01:40:50.550
<v Speaker 4>just watch it and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2439
01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:53.160
<v Speaker 4>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not really fighting.</v>

2440
01:40:53.530 --> 01:40:55.030
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're really hitting each other with</v>

2441
01:40:55.031 --> 01:40:57.340
<v Speaker 4>chairs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're really jumping off the top rope.</v>

2442
01:40:57.341 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 4>It's slamming each other.</v>

2443
01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 4>I mean all the crazy shit that they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2444
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:03.910
<v Speaker 4>the toll those guys take on their body</v>
<v Speaker 4>is an unbearable,</v>

2445
01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:07.720
<v Speaker 4>like what we're saying about Kurt Angle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that guy has gone through a fuck</v>

2446
01:41:07.721 --> 01:41:08.740
<v Speaker 4>load.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2447
01:41:08.830 --> 01:41:12.640
<v Speaker 4>see if you can find that picture.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's on Ronda Rousey's instagram</v>

2448
01:41:12.641 --> 01:41:15.910
<v Speaker 4>page.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ronda Rousey with Kurt Angle at the end</v>

2449
01:41:15.911 --> 01:41:20.140
<v Speaker 4>of their match and you're looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 he won Olympic gold medal with a</v>

2450
01:41:20.141 --> 01:41:24.640
<v Speaker 4>broken neck and he's still going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>gold medal with his neck was broken.</v>

2451
01:41:24.641 --> 01:41:26.640
<v Speaker 4>Then he won the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brogan freaking night,</v>

2452
01:41:26.650 --> 01:41:28.540
<v Speaker 4>not like broken in half.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was fractured.</v>

2453
01:41:28.570 --> 01:41:30.250
<v Speaker 4>He had a fracture in his neck and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>still one.</v>

2454
01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:33.460
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't supposed to restaurant.</v>

2455
01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:34.100
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2456
01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:34.990
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2457
01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.160
<v Speaker 4>Not that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a good one.</v>

2458
01:41:36.161 --> 01:41:40.840
<v Speaker 4>But the one with the arms raised,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it on hers?</v>

2459
01:41:41.710 --> 01:41:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's not.</v>

2460
01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.810
<v Speaker 4>There it is right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>

2461
01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.610
<v Speaker 4>Look at his arms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2462
01:41:44.610 --> 01:41:45.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your feed.</v>

2463
01:41:45.490 --> 01:41:46.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at that left arm.</v>

2464
01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like,</v>

2465
01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.030
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no offense Jamie.</v>

2466
01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:51.070
<v Speaker 4>It looks like Jamie's arm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim,</v>

2467
01:41:51.071 --> 01:41:53.470
<v Speaker 4>you've got big arms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You do have big arms.</v>

2468
01:41:53.471 --> 01:41:55.900
<v Speaker 4>I mean you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you have big arms for a normal guy.</v>

2469
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:57.190
<v Speaker 4>He's a god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go Gorilla.</v>

2470
01:41:57.220 --> 01:41:58.300
<v Speaker 4>Normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2471
01:41:58.330 --> 01:41:59.890
<v Speaker 4>for normal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well your your athletic,</v>

2472
01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.860
<v Speaker 4>but your guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying anything bad,</v>

2473
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:05.800
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying that for the size of what</v>
<v Speaker 4>he used to look like.</v>

2474
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:08.020
<v Speaker 4>Go back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at the size of his fucking neck,</v>

2475
01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:10.840
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is that thing right below his ear?</v>

2476
01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:12.730
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his neck.</v>

2477
01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:13.940
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's your fucking,</v>

2478
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:16.240
<v Speaker 4>that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just gotta go for living in his neck.</v>

2479
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:18.970
<v Speaker 4>You know the way those guys train their</v>
<v Speaker 4>neck is crazy.</v>

2480
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.880
<v Speaker 4>The way that dude's with bridges and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit and then that's just not good for</v>

2481
01:42:21.881 --> 01:42:23.230
<v Speaker 4>you man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>

2482
01:42:23.231 --> 01:42:26.530
<v Speaker 4>But there's an article about that</v>
<v Speaker 4>recently where they were describing like</v>

2483
01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:28.900
<v Speaker 4>the dangers of neck bridging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2484
01:42:28.901 --> 01:42:30.890
<v Speaker 4>he does strengthen your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well wrestling,</v>

2485
01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:33.160
<v Speaker 4>they do a lot of shit that's not great</v>
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>

2486
01:42:33.161 --> 01:42:35.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't think rightly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of part of the par for the</v>

2487
01:42:35.381 --> 01:42:35.921
<v Speaker 4>course.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2488
01:42:35.921 --> 01:42:39.040
<v Speaker 4>With collegiate style wrestling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever fuck with that iron neck?</v>

2489
01:42:39.250 --> 01:42:39.940
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:41.060
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

2491
01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:46.060
<v Speaker 4>I love that they use it for some dead</v>
<v Speaker 4>lifts the other day and I felt I felt</v>

2492
01:42:46.061 --> 01:42:47.440
<v Speaker 4>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>legitimately felt stronger.</v>

2493
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:48.460
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's phenomenal.</v>

2494
01:42:48.461 --> 01:42:52.000
<v Speaker 4>I actually used it and didn't know that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an issue with my neck until I used</v>

2495
01:42:52.001 --> 01:42:53.360
<v Speaker 4>it and then after I used it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2496
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:56.200
<v Speaker 4>wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can turn my head all the way now.</v>

2497
01:42:56.200 --> 01:42:58.750
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things about it is the range</v>

2498
01:42:58.751 --> 01:43:03.280
<v Speaker 4>of motion that it gives you and for</v>
<v Speaker 4>grapplers I think it is mandatory.</v>

2499
01:43:03.281 --> 01:43:05.140
<v Speaker 4>I think it would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a mandatory thing for,</v>

2500
01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:07.330
<v Speaker 4>I fucked my neck up for a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

2501
01:43:07.331 --> 01:43:10.210
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from being an idiot and not tapping to</v>

2502
01:43:10.211 --> 01:43:12.460
<v Speaker 4>from getting injured and still training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but three,</v>

2503
01:43:12.461 --> 01:43:15.040
<v Speaker 4>because one of my biggest moves is the</v>
<v Speaker 4>arm triangle.</v>

2504
01:43:15.190 --> 01:43:18.400
<v Speaker 4>So in the arm triangle when you grow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get a head and arm choke.</v>

2505
01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:20.260
<v Speaker 4>When I got the art guys arm trapped</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2506
01:43:20.261 --> 01:43:24.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm using my neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I'm constantly like pinning things</v>

2507
01:43:24.161 --> 01:43:28.420
<v Speaker 4>down with my neck and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're rolling for a fucking hour a</v>

2508
01:43:28.421 --> 01:43:30.880
<v Speaker 4>night or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of pressure you're putting on</v>

2509
01:43:30.881 --> 01:43:35.020
<v Speaker 4>your neck and then defending things with</v>
<v Speaker 4>your neck and everything gets inflamed</v>

2510
01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:37.930
<v Speaker 4>and everything's injured and you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>these little micro injuries that never</v>

2511
01:43:37.931 --> 01:43:40.000
<v Speaker 4>really heal because you're back training</v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

2512
01:43:40.001 --> 01:43:42.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the iron neck thing works great to,</v>

2513
01:43:42.241 --> 01:43:45.700
<v Speaker 4>I think we both looked at it kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>skeptical when we first saw it and then</v>

2514
01:43:45.701 --> 01:43:48.940
<v Speaker 4>the guy did a demo for us and we both</v>
<v Speaker 4>used it and thought it was really cool.</v>

2515
01:43:48.970 --> 01:43:52.030
<v Speaker 4>And you put on this from your helmet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks weird and I ended up beginning,</v>

2516
01:43:52.030 --> 01:43:52.321
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

2517
01:43:52.321 --> 01:43:53.330
<v Speaker 1>what is this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2518
01:43:53.331 --> 01:43:54.164
<v Speaker 1>And then it works great.</v>

2519
01:43:54.170 --> 01:43:56.130
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even one of those harnesses with a</v>

2520
01:43:56.131 --> 01:43:58.250
<v Speaker 4>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just anything where you're,</v>

2521
01:43:58.280 --> 01:44:00.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just constantly conditioning your neck</v>

2522
01:44:00.851 --> 01:44:03.800
<v Speaker 4>and your neck needs workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really does.</v>

2523
01:44:04.090 --> 01:44:06.710
<v Speaker 4>It's when you know you're serious about</v>
<v Speaker 4>trainings when you have a fucking neck</v>

2524
01:44:06.711 --> 01:44:07.810
<v Speaker 4>harness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah man.</v>

2525
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:10.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always had that one back in the</v>

2526
01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:12.170
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a big believer in working out your</v>

2527
01:44:12.171 --> 01:44:12.921
<v Speaker 4>neck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2528
01:44:12.921 --> 01:44:16.310
<v Speaker 4>and John Jacques Machado,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my Jujitsu instructor is a very famous</v>

2529
01:44:16.311 --> 01:44:17.570
<v Speaker 4>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He says,</v>

2530
01:44:17.571 --> 01:44:20.150
<v Speaker 4>never trust your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

2531
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never Trust your neck.</v>

2532
01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:23.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you think that you'll see,</v>

2533
01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:24.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if someone's choking you,</v>

2534
01:44:24.531 --> 01:44:26.210
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't just think that your neck is</v>

2535
01:44:26.211 --> 01:44:27.920
<v Speaker 4>strong enough to handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>

2536
01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:29.780
<v Speaker 4>Protect your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2537
01:44:29.781 --> 01:44:32.120
<v Speaker 4>Kurt Angle looks like he's got over 20</v>
<v Speaker 4>inch neck or something.</v>

2538
01:44:32.121 --> 01:44:32.661
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's cute.</v>

2539
01:44:32.661 --> 01:44:34.880
<v Speaker 4>It looks like he's pushing his head off</v>
<v Speaker 4>his fucking shoulders.</v>

2540
01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:35.481
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2541
01:44:35.481 --> 01:44:38.000
<v Speaker 4>it's like two of my thighs holding his</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking head up.</v>

2542
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:40.640
<v Speaker 4>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably just to support his neck</v>

2543
01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:42.380
<v Speaker 4>with all the injuries of the guys had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2544
01:44:42.710 --> 01:44:44.480
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure he's got fused disks or</v>

2545
01:44:44.481 --> 01:44:45.720
<v Speaker 4>something going on up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2546
01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got,</v>

2547
01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:48.790
<v Speaker 1>he had surgery a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2548
01:44:48.791 --> 01:44:49.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

2549
01:44:49.311 --> 01:44:49.871
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2550
01:44:49.871 --> 01:44:52.270
<v Speaker 1>he was addicted to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's doing a big thing,</v>

2551
01:44:52.271 --> 01:44:53.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on sobriety.</v>

2552
01:44:54.090 --> 01:44:54.531
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2553
01:44:54.531 --> 01:44:55.361
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2554
01:44:55.361 --> 01:44:57.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily addicted to like opioids for a</v>

2555
01:44:57.671 --> 01:45:01.300
<v Speaker 1>long time and he actually got us our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually went to the point where,</v>

2556
01:45:01.301 --> 01:45:04.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was a situation where it</v>

2557
01:45:04.271 --> 01:45:09.271
<v Speaker 1>was either the drugs or he gets fired</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he basically got fired from ww or</v>

2558
01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:10.600
<v Speaker 1>released or is con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2559
01:45:10.601 --> 01:45:11.980
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever happened.</v>

2560
01:45:11.981 --> 01:45:16.690
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sort of went down a really bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>road and it's as good to see him back</v>

2561
01:45:16.691 --> 01:45:19.150
<v Speaker 1>and be held back being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>

2562
01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:21.040
<v Speaker 1>as healthy as he can be at this point</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

2563
01:45:21.041 --> 01:45:22.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he went through a really rough time.</v>

2564
01:45:22.721 --> 01:45:23.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2565
01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:25.070
<v Speaker 4>I loved your documentary prescription</v>
<v Speaker 4>thugs,</v>

2566
01:45:25.090 --> 01:45:28.820
<v Speaker 4>and I've shown it and recommended it to</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many people.</v>

2567
01:45:28.821 --> 01:45:32.390
<v Speaker 4>I just think we live in a crazy time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're,</v>

2568
01:45:32.391 --> 01:45:36.440
<v Speaker 4>you're hearing all the time someone's</v>
<v Speaker 4>cousin and my brother or this guy,</v>

2569
01:45:36.441 --> 01:45:38.480
<v Speaker 4>my mom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people get injured,</v>

2570
01:45:38.481 --> 01:45:42.290
<v Speaker 4>they get on pills and then they wind up</v>
<v Speaker 4>dying or they go down that road and they</v>

2571
01:45:42.291 --> 01:45:43.700
<v Speaker 4>become addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2572
01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:45.620
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is a fucking,</v>

2573
01:45:45.890 --> 01:45:49.040
<v Speaker 4>not so silent but epidemic in this</v>
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>

2574
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:51.980
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of people feel completely</v>
<v Speaker 4>helpless because they're getting</v>

2575
01:45:51.981 --> 01:45:55.490
<v Speaker 4>prescribed these things by their doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they think they should take them.</v>

2576
01:45:55.640 --> 01:45:56.480
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2577
01:45:56.481 --> 01:45:58.670
<v Speaker 4>you watch your friend drift away.</v>

2580
01:46:04.371 --> 01:46:06.470

2581
01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:09.470
<v Speaker 4>and he got hooked on pills and the next</v>
<v Speaker 4>thing you can't keep a job.</v>

2582
01:46:09.471 --> 01:46:12.470
<v Speaker 4>And he's always on the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he never did shit when I knew him,</v>

2583

<v Speaker 4>I grew up with this kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was totally normal and now he's all</v>

<v Speaker 3>It runs rampant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

2611
01:47:05.371 --> 01:47:07.680
<v Speaker 3>And it's so easy for people to get lost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:26.370
<v Speaker 3>they opened up as medicine cabinet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they threw everything away and they go,</v>

2619
01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.150
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>

2620
01:47:27.150 --> 01:47:28.890
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not doing this anymore,</v>

2621
01:47:28.891 --> 01:47:29.520
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

2622
01:47:29.520 --> 01:47:30.271
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're right,</v>

2623
01:47:30.271 --> 01:47:31.860
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you went cold Turkey.</v>

2624
01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Luckily Brendan is a strong guy</v>

2625
01:47:35.371 --> 01:47:37.740
<v Speaker 3>mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he got off of it and that was it.</v>

2626
01:47:37.741 --> 01:47:39.360
<v Speaker 3>And he likes to talk about it cause</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2627
01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:42.060
<v Speaker 3>it's an important thing because he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would have never thought that I would</v>

2628
01:47:42.061 --> 01:47:43.890
<v Speaker 3>get addicted to drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's such a sickness.</v>

2629
01:47:43.891 --> 01:47:46.560
<v Speaker 3>I remember the last,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the last time I did Percocet,</v>

2630
01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:50.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was at a UCLA USC game and I took a</v>

2631
01:47:50.251 --> 01:47:50.851
<v Speaker 3>bunch of cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2632
01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:52.590
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be sitting through this</v>
<v Speaker 3>game the whole time.</v>

2633
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:55.530
<v Speaker 3>I'll take the whole bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I took 30 of them with me to this game.</v>

2634
01:47:55.531 --> 01:47:58.830
<v Speaker 3>30 30 pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean with me to this game?</v>

2635
01:47:58.831 --> 01:48:02.340
<v Speaker 3>This is even gets even better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sit down in my seat and right behind</v>

2636
01:48:02.341 --> 01:48:07.341
<v Speaker 3>me is the doctor who runs the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who owns the clinic where I got my</v>

2637
01:48:07.351 --> 01:48:11.490
<v Speaker 3>surgery done and meanwhile I'm high like</v>
<v Speaker 3>super high talking to this doctor the</v>

2638
01:48:11.491 --> 01:48:13.770
<v Speaker 3>whole time on the pills that he</v>
<v Speaker 3>prescribed it to me.</v>

2639
01:48:14.290 --> 01:48:16.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did 30 pills during that game,</v>

2640
01:48:16.710 --> 01:48:17.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2641
01:48:17.131 --> 01:48:19.560
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did the doctor know that you're pilled</v>

2642
01:48:19.561 --> 01:48:22.350
<v Speaker 3>up?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he would had to know.</v>

2643
01:48:22.351 --> 01:48:23.011
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

2644
01:48:23.011 --> 01:48:25.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's kind of like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2645
01:48:25.711 --> 01:48:27.510
<v Speaker 3>it was a weird situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

2646
01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:28.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting,</v>

2647
01:48:29.010 --> 01:48:32.550
<v Speaker 3>getting off those pills was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was necessary.</v>

2648
01:48:32.570 --> 01:48:34.470
<v Speaker 3>It would have ended my life for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

2649
01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.660
<v Speaker 3>if you had gotten a surgery tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

2650
01:48:36.661 --> 01:48:38.760
<v Speaker 3>what if your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your hip fucked up and they had to go</v>

2651
01:48:38.761 --> 01:48:40.980
<v Speaker 3>back and Redo it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you take the pain pills?</v>

2652
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:44.130
<v Speaker 3>I would do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would take the painkillers that as</v>

2653
01:48:44.131 --> 01:48:46.590
<v Speaker 3>long as I was in the hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whatever,</v>

2654
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:48.720
<v Speaker 3>whatever I'm supervised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you be scared though,</v>

2655
01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:52.890
<v Speaker 3>that you would now jump right back in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it works that way.</v>

2656
01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:53.541
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

2657
01:48:53.541 --> 01:48:54.870
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it'd be,</v>

2658
01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:55.733
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a trigger.</v>

2659
01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:57.810
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I wouldn't take them at home.</v>

2660
01:48:57.811 --> 01:49:01.260
<v Speaker 3>I'd use Kratom or something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And who knows?</v>

2661
01:49:01.261 --> 01:49:04.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how good kratom would work</v>
<v Speaker 3>after a surgery.</v>

2662
01:49:04.670 --> 01:49:05.230
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

2663
01:49:05.230 --> 01:49:06.960
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't know how it works at them.</v>

2664
01:49:06.961 --> 01:49:09.570
<v Speaker 3>Did help you write,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helps me phenomenally.</v>

2665
01:49:09.571 --> 01:49:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2666
01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.720
<v Speaker 3>My friend cams on that stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a,</v>

2667
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:15.450
<v Speaker 3>he had a real problem with Ibuprofen for</v>
<v Speaker 3>awhile.</v>

2668
01:49:15.780 --> 01:49:19.140
<v Speaker 3>And then Doctor Rhonda Patrick did a</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast with me where she was talking</v>

2669
01:49:19.141 --> 01:49:23.490
<v Speaker 3>about the dangers of Ibuprofen and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>the different real severe side effects</v>

2670
01:49:23.491 --> 01:49:25.830
<v Speaker 3>that people have from real injury.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your Gut microbiome,</v>

2671
01:49:25.860 --> 01:49:28.500
<v Speaker 3>it ruins your libido and your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2672
01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.990
<v Speaker 3>your sperm count too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2673
01:49:30.991 --> 01:49:32.910
<v Speaker 3>this is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gut microbiome was really</v>

2674
01:49:32.911 --> 01:49:35.820
<v Speaker 3>fascinating because it causes</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation and he was dealing with</v>

2675
01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:37.260
<v Speaker 3>inflammation issues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He'd wake up,</v>

2676
01:49:37.261 --> 01:49:38.610
<v Speaker 3>his hips would hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his feet would hurt,</v>

2677
01:49:38.611 --> 01:49:40.920
<v Speaker 3>his knees would hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He'd take 800 milligrams of</v>

2678
01:49:40.921 --> 01:49:43.140
<v Speaker 3>Ibuprofen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would do it several times a day.</v>

2679
01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was a cycle.</v>

2680
01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.730
<v Speaker 3>So that was what was causing the</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation because it was fucked up as</v>

2681
01:49:47.731 --> 01:49:48.610
<v Speaker 3>gut microbiome.</v>

2682
01:49:48.700 --> 01:49:51.940
<v Speaker 1>So he gets off of it and then in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he calls me and he's like,</v>

2683
01:49:51.941 --> 01:49:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you can't fucking believe this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2684
01:49:53.231 --> 01:49:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm off in all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my pain's gone.</v>

2685
01:49:55.450 --> 01:49:58.350
<v Speaker 1>He kept running because he's an animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

2686
01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:00.160
<v Speaker 1>he said it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain's gone.</v>

2687
01:50:00.161 --> 01:50:02.170
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain was being caused by the</v>

2688
01:50:02.171 --> 01:50:04.420
<v Speaker 1>inflammation that was caused by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ibuprofen,</v>

2689
01:50:04.421 --> 01:50:06.940
<v Speaker 1>like holy fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just thanked me.</v>

2690
01:50:06.941 --> 01:50:08.020
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for Rhonda,</v>

2691
01:50:08.021 --> 01:50:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Patrick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2692
01:50:08.921 --> 01:50:10.930
<v Speaker 1>you know who not mean people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>strokes.</v>

2693
01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:12.030
<v Speaker 1>They have all sorts of funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2694
01:50:12.190 --> 01:50:13.690
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to take that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2695
01:50:13.691 --> 01:50:14.970
<v Speaker 1>it's fine if you take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2696
01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I have a headache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a little Ibuprofen.</v>

2697
01:50:16.391 --> 01:50:17.740
<v Speaker 1>You'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to kill you.</v>

2698
01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.980
<v Speaker 1>But if you take that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>800 milligrams a day for a couple of</v>

2699
01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:22.510
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows what's going to do to</v>

2700
01:50:22.511 --> 01:50:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body is not designed for</v>

2701
01:50:24.011 --> 01:50:26.410
<v Speaker 1>nonsteroidal antiinflammatories on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily basis,</v>

2702
01:50:26.411 --> 01:50:29.730
<v Speaker 1>on very high doses over and over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over combined,</v>

2703
01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advil,</v>

2704
01:50:31.060 --> 01:50:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Ibuprofen and the Acetaminophen that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>works even better.</v>

2705
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:37.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would take about eight advil a day and</v>

2706
01:50:37.541 --> 01:50:40.780
<v Speaker 1>eight tylenol a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm killing not only my liver,</v>

2707
01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:42.820
<v Speaker 1>but my kidneys also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2708
01:50:42.821 --> 01:50:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I've known a lot of people that have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>transplants because of that.</v>

2709
01:50:46.610 --> 01:50:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a kidney transplant because they're</v>

2710
01:50:49.361 --> 01:50:52.000
<v Speaker 1>taking too much ibuprofen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We finished it.</v>

2713
01:50:55.781 --> 01:50:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes out on,</v>

2714
01:50:57.021 --> 01:50:59.520
<v Speaker 1>on May 29th and that's all about Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2715
01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.270
<v Speaker 1>it's all about Kratom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a,</v>

2716
01:51:01.380 --> 01:51:03.550
<v Speaker 1>it's really about my experience with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom.</v>

2717
01:51:03.551 --> 01:51:05.350
<v Speaker 1>It's about my journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2718
01:51:05.351 --> 01:51:05.681
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2719
01:51:05.681 --> 01:51:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I was this guy who lifted weights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>did all these things and got hurt and</v>

2720
01:51:10.301 --> 01:51:12.040
<v Speaker 1>this is what happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

2721
01:51:12.041 --> 01:51:14.800
<v Speaker 1>I sort of tell the story and then as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the story,</v>

2722
01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I go out and discover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2723
01:51:16.151 --> 01:51:17.590
<v Speaker 1>is Kratom good or bad for you?</v>

2724
01:51:17.590 --> 01:51:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And we talked to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked to both sides of the issue.</v>

2725
01:51:19.871 --> 01:51:22.390
<v Speaker 1>We talked to the Congress people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to ban it.</v>

2726
01:51:22.391 --> 01:51:24.250
<v Speaker 1>We talked to the ones that are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>save it and well,</v>

2727
01:51:24.251 --> 01:51:25.960
<v Speaker 1>they're calling it an opiate now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2728
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:27.030
<v Speaker 1>They call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they definitely call it.</v>

2729
01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:30.380
<v Speaker 1>It was a real recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are recent redefinition of the</v>

<v Speaker 1>and in the movie you'll see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very pivotal.</v>

2732
01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:37.960
<v Speaker 1>Like what you do is awesome with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

2733
01:51:37.961 --> 01:51:39.460
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we,</v>

2734
01:51:39.490 --> 01:51:43.960
<v Speaker 1>what we were able to do from that show</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like basically you kept Kratom legal,</v>

2735
01:51:44.190 --> 01:51:45.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without even knowing it.</v>

2736
01:51:45.341 --> 01:51:47.950
<v Speaker 1>So we did the podcast and then after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>

2737
01:51:47.951 --> 01:51:49.150
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

2738
01:51:49.151 --> 01:51:50.710
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anybody wants to help,</v>

2739
01:51:50.711 --> 01:51:51.680
<v Speaker 1>where can they go?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2740
01:51:51.681 --> 01:51:56.590
<v Speaker 1>they'd go on this website and they leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments for the Dea will 23,000 people</v>

2741
01:51:56.591 --> 01:51:57.850
<v Speaker 1>or maybe 24,000 people.</v>

2742
01:51:57.850 --> 01:52:00.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember left comments after</v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast.</v>

2743
01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.530
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dea said,</v>

2744
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2745
01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:04.720
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

2746
01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:07.360
<v Speaker 1>We can't make this illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people go crazy.</v>

2747
01:52:07.510 --> 01:52:10.200
<v Speaker 1>But what did they do recently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely classified,</v>

2748
01:52:10.210 --> 01:52:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it's totally illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the FDA,</v>

2749
01:52:12.641 --> 01:52:15.040
<v Speaker 1>not the dea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The FDA came out.</v>

2750
01:52:15.041 --> 01:52:16.470
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2751
01:52:16.510 --> 01:52:17.231
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2752
01:52:17.231 --> 01:52:22.231
<v Speaker 1>so here's why really this why calls</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative and opioid and warrants against</v>

2753
01:52:22.271 --> 01:52:23.650
<v Speaker 1>using this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you why.</v>

2754
01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:25.590
<v Speaker 1>It's because hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2755
01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:27.200
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2756
01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:30.340
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that the FDA is doing the right</v>

2757
01:52:30.341 --> 01:52:31.420
<v Speaker 1>thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

2758
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dare you.</v>

2759
01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:34.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you what have you done with</v>

2760
01:52:34.061 --> 01:52:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Chris?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you why.</v>

2761
01:52:36.810 --> 01:52:39.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are marketing Kratom the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong way.</v>

2762
01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:42.520
<v Speaker 1>They're packaging it the wrong way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are not testing it.</v>

2763
01:52:42.521 --> 01:52:45.470
<v Speaker 1>And when they're not testing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have things like a salmonella</v>

2764
01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:46.670
<v Speaker 1>outbreak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard about that.</v>

2765
01:52:46.670 --> 01:52:47.900
<v Speaker 1>That hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2766
01:52:47.901 --> 01:52:50.000
<v Speaker 1>put 28 people or something in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital.</v>

2767
01:52:50.001 --> 01:52:53.180
<v Speaker 1>So I forget how many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a salmonella outbreak and</v>

2768
01:52:53.181 --> 01:52:57.620
<v Speaker 1>that's because a company buys Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 1>from overseas,</v>

2769
01:52:57.621 --> 01:53:00.350
<v Speaker 1>from like Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get it shipped here and they don't</v>

2770
01:53:00.351 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 1>test it for contaminants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2771
01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:06.830
<v Speaker 1>So the company that I did the film with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a company called urban ice,</v>

2772
01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:10.280
<v Speaker 1>they test all the products for</v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminants three times during the</v>

2773
01:53:10.281 --> 01:53:10.911
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2774
01:53:10.911 --> 01:53:13.100
<v Speaker 1>you own a supplement company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how it works.</v>

2775
01:53:13.101 --> 01:53:14.780
<v Speaker 1>You have to test your shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>independently.</v>

2776
01:53:14.781 --> 01:53:16.940
<v Speaker 1>It's very important day party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent testing.</v>

2777
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:19.880
<v Speaker 1>And that's what people aren't doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're trying to make,</v>

2778
01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:21.650
<v Speaker 1>so they make it cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2779
01:53:21.651 --> 01:53:23.420
<v Speaker 1>and then the companies that are doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2780
01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:27.350
<v Speaker 1>that screws them because now they got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to make their product cheaper to</v>

2781
01:53:27.351 --> 01:53:30.260
<v Speaker 1>keep up with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're paying for the testing each</v>

2782
01:53:30.261 --> 01:53:30.630
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2783
01:53:30.630 --> 01:53:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the supplement business is almost on the</v>

2784
01:53:33.211 --> 01:53:34.580
<v Speaker 4>honor system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2785
01:53:34.581 --> 01:53:35.460
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

2786
01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:38.070
<v Speaker 4>it's really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend Aubrey,</v>

2787
01:53:38.071 --> 01:53:42.750
<v Speaker 4>whom I'm partners with an on it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was explaining to me how those big</v>

2788
01:53:42.751 --> 01:53:43.980
<v Speaker 4>Dick pills work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2789
01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:44.851
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2790
01:53:44.851 --> 01:53:46.770
<v Speaker 4>when you buy them at the gas station and</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hard on pills,</v>

2791
01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:51.150
<v Speaker 4>he's like those pills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most of them have cialis or Viagra and</v>

2792
01:53:51.151 --> 01:53:51.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2793
01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:55.470
<v Speaker 4>And so they get busted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody bust some and then once they</v>

2794
01:53:55.471 --> 01:53:56.131
<v Speaker 4>bust them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go,</v>

2795
01:53:56.131 --> 01:53:56.581
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

2796
01:53:56.581 --> 01:53:59.070
<v Speaker 4>They changed the name of the company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they sell it again and then they get</v>

2797
01:53:59.071 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 4>busted again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they just keep doing this because</v>

2798
01:54:00.681 --> 01:54:01.514
<v Speaker 4>there's a little shuffle.</v>

2799
01:54:01.540 --> 01:54:03.880
<v Speaker 1>We're in the same thing with the Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry based on,</v>

2800
01:54:03.881 --> 01:54:04.340
<v Speaker 1>so what else</v>

2801
01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Susan Kratom like if you buy Kratom</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere,</v>

2802
01:54:06.861 --> 01:54:08.840
<v Speaker 4>what could it possibly be other than,</v>

2803
01:54:09.460 --> 01:54:10.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2804
01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:12.330
<v Speaker 1>so there's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens sometimes.</v>

2805
01:54:12.331 --> 01:54:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's different acts actually</v>

2806
01:54:14.461 --> 01:54:16.530
<v Speaker 1>happened in Sweden to the point where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people died.</v>

2807
01:54:16.531 --> 01:54:18.100
<v Speaker 1>So in Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2808
01:54:18.101 --> 01:54:22.440
<v Speaker 1>they put fentanyl in with Kratom's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ and nine nine people died.</v>

2809
01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:25.770
<v Speaker 1>And I don't want to scare people off of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a have taken it because I use it every</v>

2810
01:54:25.771 --> 01:54:26.130
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2811
01:54:26.130 --> 01:54:29.540
<v Speaker 1>the spray company that you use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that was the guy that's brought</v>

2812
01:54:29.550 --> 01:54:31.260
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Nice organics,</v>

2813
01:54:31.261 --> 01:54:33.410
<v Speaker 1>that company have an ice organics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2814
01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:35.550
<v Speaker 1>And that stuff I've used and it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2815
01:54:35.551 --> 01:54:38.760
<v Speaker 1>That their website's natural organics</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an x on the end.com.</v>

2816
01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:41.270
<v Speaker 4>What's interesting to me too is that in</v>
<v Speaker 4>low doses,</v>

2817
01:54:41.271 --> 01:54:43.700
<v Speaker 4>it's actually kind of a stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Almost like a cup of coffee.</v>

2818
01:54:43.701 --> 01:54:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Burden,</v>

2819
01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:46.520
<v Speaker 4>high doses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's more relaxing.</v>

2820
01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:47.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2821
01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Do you take it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take it occasionally.</v>

2822
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have some in the back.</v>

2823
01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2824
01:54:52.350 --> 01:54:53.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did.</v>

2825
01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

2826
01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:54.940
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

2827
01:54:54.941 --> 01:54:56.110
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2828
01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:59.980
<v Speaker 1>not everybody is in pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people feel stress.</v>

2829
01:55:00.010 --> 01:55:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Stress is a big deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2830
01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:03.430
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kratom really helps people with anxiety,</v>

2831
01:55:03.431 --> 01:55:05.890
<v Speaker 1>ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone has anxiety,</v>

2832
01:55:05.891 --> 01:55:07.510
<v Speaker 1>like how many pills did they take for</v>
<v Speaker 1>anxiety?</v>

2833
01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:10.510
<v Speaker 1>But see I take two at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the problem we're getting</v>

2834
01:55:10.511 --> 01:55:12.760
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really tell people that stuff</v>

2835
01:55:12.761 --> 01:55:16.180
<v Speaker 1>cause that's like illegal according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FDA now I can because I'm a film</v>

2836
01:55:16.181 --> 01:55:16.841
<v Speaker 1>maker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

2837
01:55:16.841 --> 01:55:17.710
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2838
01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:20.230
<v Speaker 1>so I would say take two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2839
01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:22.530
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a company can't tell you that like</v>

2840
01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:23.201
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2841
01:55:23.201 --> 01:55:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you as the owner of onnit can't say take</v>
<v Speaker 1>this many pills and this whole like take</v>

2842
01:55:26.951 --> 01:55:28.900
<v Speaker 1>this much alpha brain and it'll do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your brain.</v>

2843
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Cause you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say the wrong thing and the FDA's</v>

2844
01:55:31.301 --> 01:55:32.260
<v Speaker 1>all over your ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2845
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:34.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an issue.</v>

2846
01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the way that the way that Kratom</v>

2847
01:55:37.271 --> 01:55:40.630
<v Speaker 1>needs to be marketed is like basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that supplements are supposed to</v>

2848
01:55:40.631 --> 01:55:42.400
<v Speaker 1>be marketed is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2849
01:55:42.401 --> 01:55:44.610
<v Speaker 1>that you're taking it for a specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>response</v>

2850
01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:46.800
<v Speaker 3>and the FDA doesn't let you tell people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2851
01:55:46.801 --> 01:55:50.640
<v Speaker 3>which is just really screwed up too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I think that that's a problem.</v>

2852
01:55:50.670 --> 01:55:51.510
<v Speaker 3>It's like an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2853
01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.700
<v Speaker 3>like you should be able to say what it</v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

2854
01:55:53.730 --> 01:55:56.280
<v Speaker 3>The problem is people make way too many</v>
<v Speaker 3>health claims.</v>

2855
01:55:56.281 --> 01:56:01.020
<v Speaker 3>So with Kratom they make the health</v>
<v Speaker 3>claim that it will cure opioid addiction</v>

2856
01:56:01.050 --> 01:56:04.260
<v Speaker 3>and that's a huge claim to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2857
01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:07.830
<v Speaker 3>it's a ridiculous claim to make.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It can help somebody get over an opioid</v>

2858
01:56:07.831 --> 01:56:10.500
<v Speaker 3>addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to say it cures and opioid addiction</v>

2859
01:56:10.501 --> 01:56:11.610
<v Speaker 3>or to say that it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2860
01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:14.910
<v Speaker 3>even even will cure your pain or help</v>
<v Speaker 3>your pain.</v>

2861
01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:18.570
<v Speaker 3>Those are bigger claims then supplements</v>
<v Speaker 3>are allowed to make.</v>

2862
01:56:18.571 --> 01:56:21.030
<v Speaker 3>And that's the issue with people coming</v>
<v Speaker 3>down on it.</v>

2863
01:56:21.090 --> 01:56:24.660
<v Speaker 3>But is the thing like what helps you</v>
<v Speaker 3>over an addiction?</v>

2864
01:56:24.661 --> 01:56:26.460
<v Speaker 3>There's so many factors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

2865
01:56:26.461 --> 01:56:27.290
<v Speaker 3>there's genetics.</v>

2866
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Some people have a genetic propensity</v>
<v Speaker 3>for addiction.</v>

2867
01:56:29.670 --> 01:56:31.350
<v Speaker 3>It's just the fact that runs in their</v>
<v Speaker 3>family.</v>

2868
01:56:31.650 --> 01:56:33.450
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if that's nature and</v>
<v Speaker 3>nurture,</v>

2869
01:56:33.451 --> 01:56:36.600
<v Speaker 3>but cause I don't have it in my family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some people do.</v>

2870
01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:40.650
<v Speaker 3>I know people that they drink one drink</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they get fucking job and they're off</v>

2871
01:56:40.651 --> 01:56:42.040
<v Speaker 3>to the races.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was gone,</v>

2872
01:56:42.090 --> 01:56:43.170
<v Speaker 3>they disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2873
01:56:43.171 --> 01:56:44.040
<v Speaker 3>people like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2874
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:45.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was a big difference.</v>

2875
01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:50.340
<v Speaker 3>My Dad says there was a big difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between our brother Mike and and me and</v>

2876
01:56:50.341 --> 01:56:53.760
<v Speaker 3>the way that we did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I sort of fell into it.</v>

2877
01:56:53.790 --> 01:56:57.030
<v Speaker 3>But Mike was kind of always that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fell into it because of surgery</v>

2878
01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:59.950
<v Speaker 3>because surgery and constant pain</v>
<v Speaker 3>because if you have,</v>

2879
01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.910
<v Speaker 3>Mike fell into it cause he was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>osteoarthritis arthritis,</v>

2880
01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:07.050
<v Speaker 3>our brother mad dog,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fell into it because he was animal.</v>

2881
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:08.860
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was always that guy.</v>

2882
01:57:09.110 --> 01:57:10.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

2883
01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:13.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guy who's like the king of the</v>

2884
01:57:13.531 --> 01:57:15.420
<v Speaker 3>school ahead of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was mad dog.</v>

2885
01:57:15.421 --> 01:57:16.440
<v Speaker 3>He was always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2886
01:57:16.441 --> 01:57:19.050
<v Speaker 3>always in charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Always had the most friends,</v>

2887
01:57:19.051 --> 01:57:20.400
<v Speaker 3>was super popular,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2888
01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:22.530
<v Speaker 3>But there was something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some void inside,</v>

2889
01:57:22.531 --> 01:57:25.590
<v Speaker 3>something missing that would turn them</v>
<v Speaker 3>to drugs and alcohol.</v>

2890
01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like when you know someone that has</v>

2891
01:57:29.341 --> 01:57:31.980
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is such a helpless feeling because</v>

2892
01:57:31.981 --> 01:57:33.390
<v Speaker 3>there's not a goddamn thing you can do</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

2893
01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:35.460
<v Speaker 3>I first experienced it when I was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>high school.</v>

2894
01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my dad was an architect and a,</v>

2895
01:57:38.641 --> 01:57:43.641
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of gigs over the summer</v>
<v Speaker 3>working on construction sites and so I</v>

2896
01:57:43.771 --> 01:57:47.010
<v Speaker 3>would hang out with a lot of these guys</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were carpenters and laborers and</v>

2897
01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:49.350
<v Speaker 3>this one guy that I've worked with is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>great guy,</v>

2898
01:57:49.770 --> 01:57:51.600
<v Speaker 3>but he couldn't fucking lay off the</v>
<v Speaker 3>coke.</v>

2899
01:57:51.680 --> 01:57:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't,</v>

2900
01:57:52.380 --> 01:57:53.520
<v Speaker 3>he would get clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2901
01:57:53.521 --> 01:57:55.080
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting my band together.</v>

2902
01:57:55.081 --> 01:57:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's awesome man.</v>

2903
01:57:56.220 --> 01:57:58.650
<v Speaker 3>Good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he would come in,</v>

2904
01:57:58.651 --> 01:58:01.290
<v Speaker 3>hung over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up like it just looks like he had</v>

2905
01:58:01.291 --> 01:58:05.210
<v Speaker 3>the flu and it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dark and it's dark and stop.</v>

2906
01:58:05.220 --> 01:58:08.010
<v Speaker 3>You keep going back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to go in my bathroom in the</v>

2907
01:58:08.011 --> 01:58:10.860
<v Speaker 3>morning hungover every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look in the mirror and go,</v>

2908
01:58:10.861 --> 01:58:15.861
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that fat gross wrinkly old</v>

2909
01:58:16.651 --> 01:58:19.110
<v Speaker 3>dude doing in the mirror?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what happened to you?</v>

2910
01:58:19.220 --> 01:58:21.930
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a movie was 96% on rotten</v>

2911
01:58:21.931 --> 01:58:24.480
<v Speaker 3>tomatoes about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about steroids and,</v>

2912
01:58:24.481 --> 01:58:27.420
<v Speaker 3>and health and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and trying to figure out if this is good</v>

2913
01:58:27.421 --> 01:58:30.690
<v Speaker 3>or bad for you and now you're just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up drug addict.</v>

2914
01:58:30.810 --> 01:58:34.440
<v Speaker 3>And I would just cry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had nothing like nowhere to turn.</v>

2915
01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I couldn't tell my parents</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they just experienced it.</v>

2916
01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I felt like I couldn't tell my brother</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause he's in the fitness and training</v>

2917
01:58:41.411 --> 01:58:42.040
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to be like,</v>

2918
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.270
<v Speaker 2>come on dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>snap out of it.</v>

2919
01:58:43.271 --> 01:58:44.630
<v Speaker 2>You know how that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's what I,</v>

2920
01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 2>it's what I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what I thought didn't happen as soon</v>

2921
01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:49.120
<v Speaker 2>as mark found out about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>

2922
01:58:49.121 --> 01:58:50.860
<v Speaker 2>come here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give me a big hug and say,</v>

2923
01:58:50.861 --> 01:58:51.694
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to help you.</v>

2924
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:52.210
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2925
01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:55.660
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's most people's fear is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's going to be really bad.</v>

2926
01:58:56.050 --> 01:58:57.760
<v Speaker 2>But I should tell everybody it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be really,</v>

2927
01:58:57.761 --> 01:59:00.670
<v Speaker 2>really good when you come out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That other side of wife was a big part</v>

2928
01:59:00.671 --> 01:59:03.940
<v Speaker 2>of it and the advice I always give and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to always give is just don't give</v>

2929
01:59:03.941 --> 01:59:05.290
<v Speaker 2>up on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

2930
01:59:05.670 --> 01:59:08.050
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to overextend yourself</v>

2931
01:59:08.051 --> 01:59:10.720
<v Speaker 2>because you are going to get fucked over</v>
<v Speaker 2>by people that are addicts.</v>

2932
01:59:10.721 --> 01:59:12.350
<v Speaker 2>You will get screwed over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2933
01:59:12.490 --> 01:59:13.810
<v Speaker 2>but you just tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2934
01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:15.280
<v Speaker 2>whenever you're ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to help.</v>

2935
01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Whatever way I can help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can help financially,</v>

2936
01:59:17.291 --> 01:59:18.610
<v Speaker 2>if I can help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2937
01:59:18.910 --> 01:59:20.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever way I can help,</v>

2938
01:59:20.290 --> 01:59:21.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just let them know.</v>

2939
01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.720
<v Speaker 2>And then that way you can always at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least feel good that you,</v>

2940
01:59:24.780 --> 01:59:27.520
<v Speaker 2>you at least did some of your part there</v>
<v Speaker 2>in with him,</v>

2941
01:59:27.850 --> 01:59:31.150
<v Speaker 2>my wife was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to get him the hell out of Los</v>

2942
01:59:31.150 --> 01:59:32.140
<v Speaker 2>Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We live in Sacramento.</v>

2943
01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:33.370
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got to get them up here.</v>

2944
01:59:33.371 --> 01:59:35.740
<v Speaker 2>So we flew him up just so you can keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>an eye on them.</v>

2945
01:59:35.770 --> 01:59:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Not that Sacramento is not without its</v>
<v Speaker 2>temptation.</v>

2946
01:59:37.841 --> 01:59:38.890
<v Speaker 2>That's a hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent.</v>

2947
01:59:39.150 --> 01:59:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Just a not be on his own was the main</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is he doesn't have any family down</v>

2948
01:59:42.791 --> 01:59:45.420
<v Speaker 2>here and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we did that and took him under is</v>

2949
01:59:45.790 --> 01:59:47.680
<v Speaker 2>under our wing and um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I think everything helped get them to</v>

2952
01:59:53.111 --> 01:59:55.030
<v Speaker 2>where he is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so proud of him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>We're supposed to talk shit about each</v>

<v Speaker 2>been an idol of mine sent,</v>

02:00:16.251 --> 02:00:17.890
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the driver of a lot of this.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2972
02:00:33.130 --> 02:00:34.530
<v Speaker 2>you can tell when someone's healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all.</v>

2973
02:00:34.531 --> 02:00:36.190
<v Speaker 2>I first started getting sober.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard,</v>

2974
02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:37.001
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he was losing weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was doing everything,</v>

2976
02:00:38.770 --> 02:00:39.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's doing everything good,</v>

2977
02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:43.210
<v Speaker 2>but he still was getting sick all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and he looked sickly,</v>

2978
02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:43.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Is He really doing okay?</v>

2981
02:00:47.111 --> 02:00:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And it took time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took a long time.</v>

2982
02:00:48.881 --> 02:00:52.770
<v Speaker 2>The best thing for me is being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>give back and um,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and so what's really beautiful is being</v>

2996
02:01:20.771 --> 02:01:22.900
<v Speaker 2>able to help these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2997
02:01:22.990 --> 02:01:25.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgetting about these people because</v>

<v Speaker 2>there's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's hundreds of emails and texts and</v>

2999
02:01:28.601 --> 02:01:29.740
<v Speaker 2>things at porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the next guy.</v>

3002
02:01:32.860 --> 02:01:35.140
<v Speaker 2>But then three or four months later you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get this,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

3007
02:01:41.751 --> 02:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure some of them still go the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>way and you can't save everybody and</v>

3008
02:01:45.540 --> 02:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't help everybody,</v>

3009
02:01:46.971 --> 02:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>but you sure can try,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3011
02:01:49.871 --> 02:01:51.880
<v Speaker 4>podcasts like this always make an</v>
<v Speaker 4>impact.</v>

3012
02:01:51.881 --> 02:01:53.920
<v Speaker 4>There's people out there that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>listening right now and they might be in</v>

3013
02:01:53.921 --> 02:01:55.750
<v Speaker 4>their car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might be sitting at home just</v>

3014
02:01:55.751 --> 02:01:57.340
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out what the fuck to do</v>
<v Speaker 4>with their life.</v>

3015
02:01:57.610 --> 02:02:00.250
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes all people need is that little</v>
<v Speaker 4>extra juice,</v>

3016
02:02:00.490 --> 02:02:02.680
<v Speaker 4>that little extra motivation that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>get from here.</v>

3017
02:02:02.730 --> 02:02:06.250
<v Speaker 4>Somebody like yourself that's gone</v>
<v Speaker 4>through it and came out on the other</v>

3018
02:02:06.251 --> 02:02:07.510
<v Speaker 4>side healthy and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

3019
02:02:07.511 --> 02:02:09.730
<v Speaker 4>If he was crying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>looking in the mirror and feeling like</v>

3020
02:02:09.731 --> 02:02:11.780
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was addicted to drugs and,</v>

3021
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.560
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

3022
02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:15.810
<v Speaker 4>and he came from a healthy background</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he came from a background where he's</v>

3023
02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:17.350
<v Speaker 4>making a documentary about health.</v>

3024
02:02:17.610 --> 02:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>When it got really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3025
02:02:19.770 --> 02:02:20.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

3026
02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:22.950
<v Speaker 1>when you start drinking in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really bad.</v>

3027
02:02:23.370 --> 02:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3028
02:02:23.870 --> 02:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>alcohol became the worst part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse than worse than even the pills.</v>

3029
02:02:27.931 --> 02:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>And I just remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they start selling alcohol in La at</v>

3030
02:02:31.681 --> 02:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>6:00 AM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I used to live right</v>

3031
02:02:34.231 --> 02:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>across from Gold's gym in Venice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I get up and I walk across the</v>

3032
02:02:37.741 --> 02:02:42.450
<v Speaker 1>street at like five 45 because my car</v>
<v Speaker 1>was parked.</v>

3033
02:02:42.570 --> 02:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I had to park across the street right by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gym.</v>

3034
02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I walk across the street over by the gym</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd see my friends going into the</v>

3035
02:02:47.941 --> 02:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>gym for a workout and they'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Chris,</v>

3036
02:02:49.801 --> 02:02:50.591
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3037
02:02:50.591 --> 02:02:51.241
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but be waving them.</v>

3038
02:02:51.241 --> 02:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>I'd be going to the liquor store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I knew it was like</v>

3039
02:02:54.540 --> 02:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>really bad things needed to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3040
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:57.743
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3041
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:59.940
<v Speaker 1>I really do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

3042
02:02:59.970 --> 02:03:02.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes somebody just like that little</v>

3043
02:03:02.940 --> 02:03:04.530
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's people out there that are</v>

3044
02:03:04.531 --> 02:03:07.860
<v Speaker 1>listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hit me up or hit up somebody and</v>

3045
02:03:07.861 --> 02:03:09.870
<v Speaker 1>tell them that you're hurting because</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will help you.</v>

3046
02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>You need other people.</v>

3047
02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:11.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not going to do it on your own.</v>

3048
02:03:12.090 --> 02:03:13.560
<v Speaker 4>Everybody needs other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

3049
02:03:13.850 --> 02:03:15.930
<v Speaker 4>That's this idea of the lone wolf is</v>
<v Speaker 4>total here.</v>

3050
02:03:16.230 --> 02:03:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I need the help other people in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me to be fulfilled for sure.</v>

3051
02:03:19.411 --> 02:03:20.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3052
02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:21.240

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3053
02:03:21.241 --> 02:03:22.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all,</v>

3054
02:03:22.351 --> 02:03:24.660
<v Speaker 1>we're all together in this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3055
02:03:24.661 --> 02:03:26.610
<v Speaker 1>When having him at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at my house,</v>

3056
02:03:26.611 --> 02:03:27.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helped me a lot too.</v>

3057
02:03:27.931 --> 02:03:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Just just knowing that he was safe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing he was doing the right thing.</v>

3058
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got two kids.</v>

3059
02:03:32.581 --> 02:03:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't fuck around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I train,</v>

3060
02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I fucking eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to eat healthy.</v>

3061
02:03:36.061 --> 02:03:38.130
<v Speaker 1>I try to do the best I can each and</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>

3062
02:03:38.131 --> 02:03:40.860
<v Speaker 1>And having him with me made me more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountable.</v>

3063
02:03:40.861 --> 02:03:42.380
<v Speaker 1>It made me more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3064
02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:45.840
<v Speaker 1>more full bore about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it worked out good for both of us.</v>

3065
02:03:45.900 --> 02:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever investigate Ibogaine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3066
02:03:49.230 --> 02:03:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I looked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talked to the top.</v>

3067
02:03:50.850 --> 02:03:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do know the top a researcher on</v>

3068
02:03:53.161 --> 02:03:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Ibogaine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a doctor,</v>

3069
02:03:54.691 --> 02:03:55.524
<v Speaker 1>Deborah Mash.</v>

3070
02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Explain what that stuff is and what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

3071
02:03:57.450 --> 02:04:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Ibogaine is a substance that you get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Africa,</v>

3072
02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:03.870
<v Speaker 1>found an Africa and basically you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drink it.</v>

3073
02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:06.900
<v Speaker 1>I think they make up some sort of potion</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever and you drink it.</v>

3074
02:04:06.901 --> 02:04:11.901
<v Speaker 1>And then literally what to turn a 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>year heroin addict around in about a</v>

3075
02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 36 hours they say.</v>

3076
02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:17.700
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go through some ritual.</v>

3077
02:04:17.701 --> 02:04:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if the ritual does</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

3078
02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor didn't even really know if</v>

3079
02:04:21.571 --> 02:04:23.400
<v Speaker 1>the ritual does data anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's part of the,</v>

3080
02:04:23.401 --> 02:04:27.030
<v Speaker 1>a placebo I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to really work.</v>

3081
02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:29.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a schedule one drug here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

3082
02:04:29.401 --> 02:04:31.200
<v Speaker 1>You can't get it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3083
02:04:31.201 --> 02:04:34.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually fairly safe compared to a</v>

3084
02:04:34.711 --> 02:04:37.380
<v Speaker 1>lot of other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's been some deaths it,</v>

3085
02:04:37.381 --> 02:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>but it like maybe</v>

3086
02:04:38.100 --> 02:04:43.100
<v Speaker 3>15 all time or something like not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not super high and it definitely needs</v>

3087
02:04:43.141 --> 02:04:45.870
<v Speaker 3>to be medically supervised,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think it should be illegal</v>

3088
02:04:45.871 --> 02:04:46.830
<v Speaker 3>in all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it should be.</v>

3089
02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:50.190
<v Speaker 3>I think Ibogaine and Kratom or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>answers to the opioid epidemic,</v>

3090
02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:51.190
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I began,</v>

3091
02:04:51.190 --> 02:04:56.190
<v Speaker 3>has an incredibly high rate of success</v>
<v Speaker 3>in terms of like people taking nine</v>

3092
02:04:57.791 --> 02:05:00.000
<v Speaker 3>began getting off pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Ibogaine is incredible.</v>

3093
02:05:00.001 --> 02:05:01.430
<v Speaker 3>I think Ed Clay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3094
02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:03.330
<v Speaker 3>opened up a clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went down,</v>

3095
02:05:03.331 --> 02:05:06.510
<v Speaker 3>he had a issue with pills as well and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure,</v>

3096
02:05:06.511 --> 02:05:09.150
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to speak out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm pretty sure his came also from</v>

3097
02:05:09.151 --> 02:05:12.600
<v Speaker 3>an injury and then he got a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had a pill problem and then was trying</v>

3098
02:05:12.601 --> 02:05:16.860
<v Speaker 3>to figure out what the fuck to do with</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and went down to Mexico,</v>

3099
02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:19.530
<v Speaker 3>went to an Ibogaine clinic and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>

3100
02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:21.900
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fixed him up.</v>

3101
02:05:21.930 --> 02:05:23.280
<v Speaker 3>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

3102
02:05:23.310 --> 02:05:24.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opened up his own clinic.</v>

3103
02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:26.730
<v Speaker 3>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I didn't understand is I</v>

3104
02:05:26.731 --> 02:05:30.570
<v Speaker 3>interviewed this doctor Deborah Mash,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's probably because she's in</v>

3105
02:05:30.571 --> 02:05:33.120
<v Speaker 3>Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's tied in with politicians,</v>

3106
02:05:33.210 --> 02:05:37.260
<v Speaker 3>which is always a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so she's 100% for Ibogaine,</v>

3107
02:05:37.261 --> 02:05:41.610
<v Speaker 3>but she's also against Kratom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes no sense because she thinks</v>

3108
02:05:41.611 --> 02:05:42.390
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3109
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:43.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kratom is a,</v>

3110
02:05:44.230 --> 02:05:46.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I will gain,</v>

3111
02:05:46.081 --> 02:05:48.000
<v Speaker 3>you have to go get it medically</v>
<v Speaker 3>supervising,</v>

3112
02:05:48.001 --> 02:05:50.520
<v Speaker 3>medically done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And She just thinks like giving people</v>

3113
02:05:50.521 --> 02:05:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Kratom is a loosey Goosey kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3114
02:05:53.701 --> 02:05:57.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm 100% for clinics opening up and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>giving them under the doctors and give</v>

3115
02:05:57.931 --> 02:06:01.050
<v Speaker 3>the money to the state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can get Ibogaine to the hands of</v>

3116
02:06:01.051 --> 02:06:03.930
<v Speaker 3>a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so ruthlessly introspective.</v>

3117
02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:06.690
<v Speaker 3>Not from my personal experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but arbors taken it.</v>

3118
02:06:06.930 --> 02:06:09.000
<v Speaker 3>I know several people who had taken it.</v>

3119
02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.850
<v Speaker 3>I know several people that have taken it</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's completely turned their life</v>

3120
02:06:11.851 --> 02:06:16.851
<v Speaker 3>around where they had this intense 24</v>
<v Speaker 3>hour experience where you just examine</v>

3121
02:06:18.061 --> 02:06:21.090
<v Speaker 3>every single aspect of your life and</v>
<v Speaker 3>this really alien way.</v>

3122
02:06:21.091 --> 02:06:22.410
<v Speaker 3>And then after it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

3123
02:06:22.411 --> 02:06:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I am never fucking drinking again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or I'm never taken dance again.</v>

3124
02:06:25.470 --> 02:06:30.420
<v Speaker 3>And they really do change their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's also not just an introspective</v>

3125
02:06:30.421 --> 02:06:33.450
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also rewires the way your brain</v>

3126
02:06:33.451 --> 02:06:37.350
<v Speaker 3>handles the addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not qualified to speak how,</v>

3127
02:06:37.351 --> 02:06:39.020
<v Speaker 3>cause I don't really understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

3128
02:06:39.070 --> 02:06:43.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if anybody understands it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually we could explain it.</v>

3129
02:06:43.410 --> 02:06:47.430
<v Speaker 3>Aubrey can explain the mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's of some sort of a shift.</v>

3130
02:06:47.730 --> 02:06:50.520
<v Speaker 3>See if we could find that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does Ibogaine cure addiction?</v>

3131
02:06:50.630 --> 02:06:53.940
<v Speaker 3>So if you could find that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's incredibly effective.</v>

3132
02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:55.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wash it highest rates of,</v>

3133
02:06:56.060 --> 02:06:57.210
<v Speaker 3>of a success.</v>

3134
02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:00.990
<v Speaker 3>Another super high rate of success that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we might be getting in California.</v>

3135
02:07:01.630 --> 02:07:05.150
<v Speaker 3>It's on the ballot in 2018 is legalizing</v>
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin.</v>

3136
02:07:05.460 --> 02:07:09.570
<v Speaker 3>If they gonna legalize silicide been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that can fix a lot of fucking people</v>

3137
02:07:09.571 --> 02:07:11.160
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's also something that you don't</v>

3138
02:07:11.161 --> 02:07:12.230
<v Speaker 3>die from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>

3139
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's overdosing on psilocybin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ld 50 rate is something like 1500.</v>

3140
02:07:16.351 --> 02:07:17.640
<v Speaker 3>What does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that do?</v>

3141
02:07:17.970 --> 02:07:19.890
<v Speaker 3>What does it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does the magic mushrooms,</v>

3142
02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:20.420
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

3143
02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:21.380
<v Speaker 3>and that's for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3144
02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:22.470
<v Speaker 3>mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3145
02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Fermentable Johns Hopkins University did</v>
<v Speaker 3>some studies on it and one of the things</v>

3146
02:07:26.821 --> 02:07:30.930
<v Speaker 3>they found his soldiers with ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is one thing that maps is</v>

3147
02:07:30.931 --> 02:07:34.470
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially soldiers with ptsd and</v>

3148
02:07:34.471 --> 02:07:37.660
<v Speaker 3>anybody with Ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rape victims of a violent assault</v>

3149
02:07:37.661 --> 02:07:38.360
<v Speaker 3>victims.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3150
02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:42.760
<v Speaker 3>some people have some real hard time</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting past past events and um,</v>

3151
02:07:42.860 --> 02:07:45.790
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin has incredible effects on</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3152
02:07:45.910 --> 02:07:50.260
<v Speaker 3>but Mtma also does and right now maps is</v>
<v Speaker 3>involved in some pretty heavy clinical</v>

3153
02:07:50.261 --> 02:07:51.790
<v Speaker 3>trials with Mtma.</v>

3154
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:53.140
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>

3155
02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:58.170
<v Speaker 3>they think 2021 is around the time where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to have mtma clinics and</v>

3156
02:07:58.631 --> 02:08:01.750
<v Speaker 3>then it'll be legal because we have so</v>
<v Speaker 3>many soldiers that are coming back from</v>

3157
02:08:01.751 --> 02:08:05.200
<v Speaker 3>war and they're all fucked up and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>have no solutions and put these people</v>

3158
02:08:05.201 --> 02:08:07.450
<v Speaker 3>on pills and antidepressants and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these different things,</v>

3159
02:08:07.670 --> 02:08:11.770
<v Speaker 3>anti anxiety medication,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psilocybin and MDM may have shown to</v>

3160
02:08:11.771 --> 02:08:13.720
<v Speaker 3>have massive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful,</v>

3161
02:08:13.810 --> 02:08:16.150
<v Speaker 3>beneficial effects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's something that I really want to</v>

3162
02:08:16.151 --> 02:08:18.370
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do the MDM a treatment I think</v>

3163
02:08:18.371 --> 02:08:18.880
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3164
02:08:18.880 --> 02:08:21.190
<v Speaker 3>would a lot of people don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 3>is when you have an addiction,</v>

3165
02:08:21.370 --> 02:08:24.100
<v Speaker 3>there's like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's deep seated things in your,</v>

3166
02:08:24.101 --> 02:08:28.570
<v Speaker 3>in your mind and your subconscious that</v>
<v Speaker 3>drive you to go to the pills or go to</v>

3167
02:08:28.571 --> 02:08:31.420
<v Speaker 3>the drinks or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't just go away when you get</v>

3168
02:08:31.421 --> 02:08:33.760
<v Speaker 3>sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You sort of work a lot of it out.</v>

3169
02:08:34.630 --> 02:08:36.820
<v Speaker 3>But some of the subconscious stuff you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't work out.</v>

3170
02:08:36.821 --> 02:08:37.631
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3171
02:08:37.631 --> 02:08:38.710
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still things,</v>

3172
02:08:38.711 --> 02:08:41.480
<v Speaker 3>habits I don't like about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's still things I want to fix.</v>

3173
02:08:41.481 --> 02:08:43.460
<v Speaker 3>And I let me connect you to Aubrey</v>
<v Speaker 3>because he loves it.</v>

3174
02:08:43.461 --> 02:08:45.550

3175
02:08:45.551 --> 02:08:47.020
<v Speaker 3>are in the middle of those studies right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

3176
02:08:47.021 --> 02:08:51.010
<v Speaker 3>And he's actually gone through that</v>
<v Speaker 3>protocol and then operate a little bit.</v>

3177
02:08:51.011 --> 02:08:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>it because he's,</v>

3179
02:08:55.781 --> 02:08:57.160
<v Speaker 3>he's deep in this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3180
02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:00.800
<v Speaker 3>Ombre who's introduced me to him when I</v>
<v Speaker 3>went down to your gym on a gym?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a,</v>

3182
02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.240
<v Speaker 3>what I would call real psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 3>warrior.</v>

3183
02:09:04.370 --> 02:09:07.390
<v Speaker 3>And he's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's in there all the time and with some</v>

3184
02:09:07.391 --> 02:09:09.160

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3185
02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:11.470
<v Speaker 3>but there's the real benefits from it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3186
02:09:11.471 --> 02:09:13.000
<v Speaker 3>real legit benefits.</v>

3187
02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:16.510
<v Speaker 3>And we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been really robbed and it's,</v>

3188
02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:17.770
<v Speaker 3>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3189
02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:20.920
<v Speaker 3>we've been lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've been robbed and there's a lot of</v>

3190
02:09:20.921 --> 02:09:24.040
<v Speaker 3>people that use them recreationally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm not against that,</v>

3191
02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:24.911
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3192
02:09:24.911 --> 02:09:26.470
<v Speaker 3>I think you should be able do whatever</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck you want.</v>

3193
02:09:26.471 --> 02:09:28.840
<v Speaker 3>If you can drink whiskey recreationally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I do,</v>

3194
02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:31.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's anything wrong</v>
<v Speaker 3>with doing mushrooms recreationally.</v>

3195
02:09:31.581 --> 02:09:33.400
<v Speaker 3>And there's some people that think it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible and you should,</v>

3196
02:09:33.630 --> 02:09:36.550
<v Speaker 3>there are a sacrament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We still use them in a ritual and a</v>

3197
02:09:36.551 --> 02:09:38.110
<v Speaker 3>shamonic setting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say,</v>

3198
02:09:38.111 --> 02:09:41.050
<v Speaker 3>you should do that too if you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I've used it recreationally.</v>

3199
02:09:41.051 --> 02:09:45.160
<v Speaker 3>I've had a great old fucking time and</v>
<v Speaker 3>also came out of it with some insight</v>

3200
02:09:45.161 --> 02:09:47.830
<v Speaker 3>and some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different way of looking at myself and</v>

3201
02:09:47.831 --> 02:09:49.330
<v Speaker 3>looking at my life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know that,</v>

3202
02:09:49.360 --> 02:09:52.000
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this country you have to list</v>

3203
02:09:52.001 --> 02:09:56.020
<v Speaker 3>euphoria as a side effect to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>supplement or a drug wrestle area.</v>

3204
02:09:56.020 --> 02:09:59.020
<v Speaker 3>So euphoria is something that we all</v>
<v Speaker 3>should have.</v>

3205
02:09:59.050 --> 02:10:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Like we should all be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3206
02:10:00.700 --> 02:10:03.870
<v Speaker 3>So they're listed as a side effect as if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad thing they experienced you</v>

3207
02:10:03.871 --> 02:10:04.870
<v Speaker 3>for ya.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit,</v>

3208
02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:07.300
<v Speaker 3>I better not take that right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Super fucking habit.</v>

3209
02:10:07.301 --> 02:10:10.540
<v Speaker 3>And don't you think the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>induce euphoria we should be,</v>

3210
02:10:10.630 --> 02:10:12.040
<v Speaker 3>we should be handing those out like</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

3211
02:10:12.490 --> 02:10:15.250
<v Speaker 3>People are too angry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thinks these pills or maybe like</v>

3212
02:10:15.251 --> 02:10:18.670
<v Speaker 3>rehab pills kind of in a way like almost</v>
<v Speaker 3>like treatment pills because they help</v>

3213
02:10:18.671 --> 02:10:19.720
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3214
02:10:19.721 --> 02:10:23.210
<v Speaker 3>look from the inside out almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well for sure with MDA,</v>

3215
02:10:23.230 --> 02:10:26.200
<v Speaker 3>which you get in pill form,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's actually made from the bark of a</v>

3216
02:10:26.201 --> 02:10:28.300
<v Speaker 3>tree from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't we go over this the other day</v>

3217
02:10:28.450 --> 02:10:30.340
<v Speaker 3>where the fucks are from Malaysia or</v>
<v Speaker 3>some shit,</v>

3218
02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:33.470
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a tree and that there's a real</v>

3219
02:10:33.471 --> 02:10:34.100
<v Speaker 3>issue</v>

3220
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:34.740
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3221
02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:38.480
<v Speaker 2>in this country where this bark is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>

3222
02:10:38.481 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 2>this fucking wars going on to try to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>this tree and it's not a very common</v>

3223
02:10:42.441 --> 02:10:43.400
<v Speaker 2>tree either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3224
02:10:43.730 --> 02:10:44.541
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rare.</v>

3225
02:10:44.541 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 2>And we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could be in a situation where they</v>

3226
02:10:46.911 --> 02:10:50.180
<v Speaker 2>chopped down all the fucking trees that</v>
<v Speaker 2>make ecstasy before we make it legal.</v>

3227
02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:53.660
<v Speaker 2>They did it with Kratom in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Thailand made kratom illegal because</v>

3228
02:10:53.661 --> 02:10:56.570
<v Speaker 2>it was cutting into the heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the heroin trade,</v>

3229
02:10:57.290 --> 02:11:00.950
<v Speaker 2>this is back in 1947.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They made it illegal and cut down almost</v>

3230
02:11:00.951 --> 02:11:04.250
<v Speaker 2>all the Kratom trees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you see the documentary that um,</v>

3231
02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:07.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the guy did on Vice Morris Hamilton</v>

3232
02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:08.151
<v Speaker 2>Morrison was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3233
02:11:08.151 --> 02:11:10.140
<v Speaker 2>he did the Pharmacopoeia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3234
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Shell on Kratom and he goes to Thailand</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find like the only remaining Kratom</v>

3235
02:11:14.601 --> 02:11:15.620
<v Speaker 2>tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he like,</v>

3236
02:11:15.980 --> 02:11:19.420
<v Speaker 2>he finds it and wow drinks the real</v>
<v Speaker 2>kratom and all stuff like that.</v>

3237
02:11:19.420 --> 02:11:21.710
<v Speaker 2>It was really kind of fascinating that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3238
02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:23.510
<v Speaker 2>that they did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it all comes from like,</v>

3239
02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:24.321
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Malaysia,</v>

3240
02:11:24.321 --> 02:11:26.930
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever it is crazy that they tried to</v>

3241
02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:30.740
<v Speaker 2>stop the one thing that's safe because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was cutting into the fucking opium</v>

3242
02:11:30.741 --> 02:11:31.574
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3243
02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:33.530
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like crate them too.</v>

3244
02:11:33.531 --> 02:11:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I use it before I work out a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

3245
02:11:35.170 --> 02:11:35.871
<v Speaker 2>You really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3246
02:11:35.871 --> 02:11:39.500
<v Speaker 2>And even just for creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like if I want to just sit down and</v>

3247
02:11:39.501 --> 02:11:41.750
<v Speaker 2>write or think of new products or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

3248
02:11:41.751 --> 02:11:44.000
<v Speaker 2>it might be one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two in that way.</v>

3249
02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:45.770
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like it a lot.</v>

3250
02:11:45.970 --> 02:11:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what it does.</v>

3251
02:11:47.751 --> 02:11:49.280
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the mechanism is</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind it,</v>

3252
02:11:49.281 --> 02:11:52.790
<v Speaker 2>but it does give me a sense of euphoria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does make me happier.</v>

3253
02:11:53.060 --> 02:11:56.630
<v Speaker 2>One thing I've always noticed about</v>
<v Speaker 2>training is that when you feel good,</v>

3254
02:11:57.030 --> 02:12:00.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can lift so much better and it just</v>

3255
02:12:00.561 --> 02:12:03.050
<v Speaker 2>makes you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you feel really great because you</v>

3256
02:12:03.051 --> 02:12:05.210
<v Speaker 2>know you're trying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to lift with some force,</v>

3257
02:12:05.211 --> 02:12:06.740
<v Speaker 2>just like you hitting these bags and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

3258
02:12:06.741 --> 02:12:08.090
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to put something into it.</v>

3259
02:12:08.540 --> 02:12:11.420
<v Speaker 2>And if you can't put the mustard on it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to cause your shoulder</v>

3260
02:12:11.421 --> 02:12:13.310
<v Speaker 2>hurts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can make you grumpy.</v>

3261
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:15.320
<v Speaker 2>But this stuff really matters to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me,</v>

3262
02:12:15.321 --> 02:12:18.770
<v Speaker 2>for for lifting wise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I feel like I can go all in.</v>

3263
02:12:18.771 --> 02:12:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I was actually just saying the other day</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm sitting down and I go to get</v>

3264
02:12:22.221 --> 02:12:23.360
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially after some of these like</v>

3265
02:12:23.361 --> 02:12:25.760
<v Speaker 2>squat workouts and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of slow.</v>

3266
02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:27.380
<v Speaker 2>He takes me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>takes me a minute,</v>

3267
02:12:27.650 --> 02:12:30.380
<v Speaker 2>but on Kratom boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I can get up and run out the</v>

3268
02:12:30.381 --> 02:12:32.480
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like almost,</v>

3269
02:12:32.481 --> 02:12:34.220
<v Speaker 2>I would see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would consider it similar to the</v>

3270
02:12:34.221 --> 02:12:37.400
<v Speaker 2>getting out of a hot tub with you feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>going into the hot tub.</v>

3271
02:12:37.401 --> 02:12:37.791
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3272
02:12:37.791 --> 02:12:39.230
<v Speaker 2>my shit is just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>

3273
02:12:39.231 --> 02:12:40.430
<v Speaker 2>Everything's just stiff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3274
02:12:40.610 --> 02:12:42.080
<v Speaker 2>Can't get up and down the stairs so</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

3275
02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:46.730
<v Speaker 2>I got to do the sideways a trot down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stairs every morning and I get in the</v>

3276
02:12:46.731 --> 02:12:51.260
<v Speaker 2>hot tub and I can zing up the stairs</v>
<v Speaker 2>naked picture that sometimes I have pain</v>

3277
02:12:51.261 --> 02:12:56.261
<v Speaker 2>in my hip when I don't run hills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't sense men and I've talked to</v>

3278
02:12:56.901 --> 02:12:58.550
<v Speaker 2>doctors and they don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

3279
02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:01.980
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I run hills every day or not every</v>

3280
02:13:01.981 --> 02:13:03.800
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every week I run like two,</v>

3281
02:13:03.801 --> 02:13:06.410
<v Speaker 2>three times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got zero pain in that hip.</v>

3282
02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:09.110
<v Speaker 2>Could just be getting a lot of blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not in the hip flexor.</v>

3283
02:13:09.111 --> 02:13:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I think running hills and running,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3284
02:13:10.610 --> 02:13:13.220
<v Speaker 2>running in sand I think is really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really valuable.</v>

3285
02:13:13.221 --> 02:13:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Even pushing sleds and stuff because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>slows us down,</v>

3286
02:13:16.520 --> 02:13:19.700
<v Speaker 2>not that running is running can be great</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprints can be great,</v>

3287
02:13:19.701 --> 02:13:22.760
<v Speaker 2>but regular sprints for some of us who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are over 40</v>

3288
02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:28.010
<v Speaker 2>and you haven't sprinted in a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not a great idea but to run up</v>

3289
02:13:28.011 --> 02:13:31.200
<v Speaker 2>a hill or to sprint up a hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes you go slower because the</v>

3290
02:13:31.201 --> 02:13:32.040
<v Speaker 2>intensity is higher</v>

3291
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:35.490
<v Speaker 3>and it doesn't seem it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I think that's it but it's also,</v>

3292
02:13:35.491 --> 02:13:40.110
<v Speaker 3>I'm putting all this extra muscle around</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hip and my ass like there's something</v>

3293
02:13:40.111 --> 02:13:42.130
<v Speaker 3>about that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you very much.</v>

3294
02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:46.920
<v Speaker 3>But it's something about running up</v>
<v Speaker 3>hills that like,</v>

3295
02:13:47.130 --> 02:13:48.990
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I take a couple of weeks off,</v>

3296
02:13:48.991 --> 02:13:52.590
<v Speaker 3>like I was sick for a week and then the</v>
<v Speaker 3>week before that I was doing a lot of</v>

3297
02:13:52.591 --> 02:13:56.600
<v Speaker 3>other different shit and I didn't and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts to like get at me reverse hyper</v>

3298
02:13:56.620 --> 02:13:59.970
<v Speaker 3>doesn't help with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would that would make him a hip.</v>

3299
02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:04.770
<v Speaker 3>It's going to front of the hip side to</v>
<v Speaker 3>side on that is you've got to get in on</v>

3300
02:14:04.771 --> 02:14:06.390
<v Speaker 3>that hip circle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hip Circle.</v>

3301
02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:07.350
<v Speaker 3>What's a show yet?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3302
02:14:07.351 --> 02:14:08.160
<v Speaker 3>band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3303
02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:09.100
<v Speaker 3>the hip Ben.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3304
02:14:09.110 --> 02:14:09.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are great.</v>

3305
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:12.240
<v Speaker 3>It'll help you that help build up that</v>
<v Speaker 3>side ass.</v>

3306
02:14:12.241 --> 02:14:13.470
<v Speaker 3>I like to call.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

3307
02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:16.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing like running up hills</v>

3308
02:14:16.621 --> 02:14:18.960
<v Speaker 3>and the hills that I run,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all rocky terrain.</v>

3309
02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:22.260
<v Speaker 3>Some jumping from one rock to the next</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's steep like that.</v>

3310
02:14:22.740 --> 02:14:24.480
<v Speaker 3>So I'm running up and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3311
02:14:24.481 --> 02:14:26.460
<v Speaker 3>I have to take a couple of breaks to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the top.</v>

3312
02:14:26.461 --> 02:14:28.860
<v Speaker 3>It's a half a mile up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a half a mile in.</v>

3313
02:14:29.010 --> 02:14:31.180
<v Speaker 3>I have two different courses that I run.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3314
02:14:31.370 --> 02:14:34.470
<v Speaker 3>well they have several,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the ones that I run the most,</v>

3315
02:14:34.680 --> 02:14:36.690
<v Speaker 3>the full length of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could,</v>

3316
02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.450
<v Speaker 3>I could run as long as four miles or I</v>
<v Speaker 3>could do,</v>

3317
02:14:39.451 --> 02:14:42.030
<v Speaker 3>I could break it up into one or two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time I do too.</v>

3318
02:14:42.090 --> 02:14:44.070
<v Speaker 3>How long are you runs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hours,</v>

3319
02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:46.800
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a miles takes me about 40 minutes</v>

3320
02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:50.820
<v Speaker 3>because the hills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not two hours.</v>

3321
02:14:50.821 --> 02:14:51.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not 40 minutes.</v>

3322
02:14:52.110 --> 02:14:55.080
<v Speaker 3>I could run it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably do it.</v>

3323
02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:57.990
<v Speaker 3>It's 15,</v>
<v Speaker 3>16.</v>

3324
02:14:57.991 --> 02:14:59.520
<v Speaker 3>If I was running flat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3325
02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:01.980
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's hills.</v>

3326
02:15:02.370 --> 02:15:03.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not really,</v>

3327
02:15:03.301 --> 02:15:06.180
<v Speaker 3>I mean I would call it running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's more like hill sprints.</v>

3328
02:15:06.210 --> 02:15:09.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm just doing these roots was hill</v>
<v Speaker 3>sprints and I've read that a long time</v>

3329
02:15:09.211 --> 02:15:12.090
<v Speaker 3>ago that a lot of football players</v>
<v Speaker 3>prefer a hill sprints.</v>

3330
02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:13.680
<v Speaker 3>And then I saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3331
02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:16.890
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg Jackson and Mike Winkeljohn when</v>

3332
02:15:16.891 --> 02:15:19.530
<v Speaker 3>they train their fighters now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Kirky they have them run this crazy</v>

3333
02:15:19.531 --> 02:15:21.930
<v Speaker 3>mountain and they run it and run</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight up the hill.</v>

3334
02:15:22.170 --> 02:15:24.840
<v Speaker 3>And that this was like a pig thing that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did to,</v>

3335
02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:27.120
<v Speaker 3>to really build up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Darren and Walter Payton,</v>

3336
02:15:28.050 --> 02:15:30.930
<v Speaker 3>Roger Craig,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this goes on and on with Damian</v>

3337
02:15:30.930 --> 02:15:31.560
<v Speaker 3>Thompson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3338
02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.360
<v Speaker 3>Walter Peyton used to run hills till he</v>
<v Speaker 3>throw up.</v>

3339
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:35.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he threw up.</v>

3340
02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:38.640
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm running hills is great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially for bigger guys.</v>

3341
02:15:39.090 --> 02:15:42.360
<v Speaker 3>Guys that are two 50 to 60 to 70 have</v>
<v Speaker 3>joint problems.</v>

3342
02:15:42.700 --> 02:15:44.460
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be really hard to get out</v>
<v Speaker 3>there and run.</v>

3343
02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:45.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you're not,</v>

3344
02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:48.330
<v Speaker 3>it's not a pounding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not dropping the weight down.</v>

3345
02:15:48.330 --> 02:15:51.210
<v Speaker 3>Instead you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're almost doing like lunges like</v>

3346
02:15:51.211 --> 02:15:52.440
<v Speaker 3>over and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3347
02:15:52.441 --> 02:15:54.250
<v Speaker 3>And you could walk back down the hill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3348
02:15:54.251 --> 02:15:56.010
<v Speaker 3>take your time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can walk back down the hill.</v>

3349
02:15:56.011 --> 02:16:00.390
<v Speaker 3>There's evidence that shows if you do</v>
<v Speaker 3>five to eight sprints and you have long</v>

3350
02:16:00.391 --> 02:16:02.340
<v Speaker 3>periods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can have as much rest as you want</v>

3351
02:16:02.341 --> 02:16:04.710
<v Speaker 3>between,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll still get great results for fat</v>

3352
02:16:04.711 --> 02:16:05.950
<v Speaker 3>burning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

3353
02:16:05.951 --> 02:16:08.610
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't take very long to do a</v>
<v Speaker 3>workout like that.</v>

3354
02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:10.770
<v Speaker 3>It changes your cardio too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3355
02:16:10.771 --> 02:16:13.710
<v Speaker 3>it really does force him to do shit like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that with me sometimes.</v>

3356
02:16:14.320 --> 02:16:15.930
<v Speaker 3>But can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't run though,</v>

3357
02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:16.970
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>With your bad hand.</v>

3358
02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:20.230
<v Speaker 3>Not really run by pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing a sled is really hard.</v>

3359
02:16:21.150 --> 02:16:23.700
<v Speaker 3>He has a thing called the tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a kind of an amazing,</v>

3360
02:16:23.701 --> 02:16:25.480
<v Speaker 3>a sled with wheels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3361
02:16:25.490 --> 02:16:26.940
<v Speaker 3>you're pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you put weights on it.</v>

3362
02:16:27.210 --> 02:16:30.130
<v Speaker 3>So we pushed the tank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We do all sorts of stuff like that that,</v>

3363
02:16:30.150 --> 02:16:31.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are different.</v>

3364
02:16:31.871 --> 02:16:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go on a rowing machine as fast as</v>

3365
02:16:33.941 --> 02:16:34.830
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go on a,</v>

3366
02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:36.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3367
02:16:36.041 --> 02:16:37.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you call it?</v>

3368
02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:42.500
<v Speaker 1>The aerodyne bike as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The echo bike rogue.</v>

3369
02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:47.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking tank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like an Airdyne on steroids.</v>

3370
02:16:48.130 --> 02:16:51.700
<v Speaker 1>It's got these big ass fucking handles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that it looks nice.</v>

3371
02:16:51.701 --> 02:16:53.410
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

3372
02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Plus to something as simple as that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those bikes that you can get them as</v>

3373
02:16:57.731 --> 02:16:59.250
<v Speaker 1>cheap as like 500 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3374
02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:01.540
<v Speaker 1>I think it'll change your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like mark said,</v>

3375
02:17:01.541 --> 02:17:03.690
<v Speaker 1>five to eight sprints on it a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3376
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:06.220
<v Speaker 1>It's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he comes up and trained with me,</v>

3377
02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.220
<v Speaker 1>when he comes up and trains with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times he'll say,</v>

3378
02:17:09.221 --> 02:17:10.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to,</v>

3379
02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:13.330
<v Speaker 1>you know how everybody in these kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>big circuits that we do and we,</v>

3380
02:17:13.780 --> 02:17:16.210
<v Speaker 1>we train our asses off and probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes overdo it,</v>

3381
02:17:16.510 --> 02:17:18.340
<v Speaker 1>but when he joins us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of times they'll say,</v>

3382
02:17:18.341 --> 02:17:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I can't do this or I can't do that.</v>

3383
02:17:19.810 --> 02:17:20.531
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3384
02:17:20.531 --> 02:17:22.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know unless you try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

3385
02:17:22.540 --> 02:17:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm sympathetic towards fake hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have them,</v>

3386
02:17:24.791 --> 02:17:27.130
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know exactly what it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm like,</v>

3387
02:17:27.131 --> 02:17:29.380
<v Speaker 1>just try it or try a different variation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

3388
02:17:29.740 --> 02:17:31.660
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he kind of won't.</v>

3389
02:17:31.661 --> 02:17:34.420
<v Speaker 1>And then he'll kind of drift off and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next minute I'll see him,</v>

3390
02:17:34.450 --> 02:17:37.600
<v Speaker 1>I'll see him either trying it or trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>or doing some other version of it.</v>

3391
02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:38.831
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3392
02:17:38.831 --> 02:17:40.300
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's working cause he's at least doing</v>

3393
02:17:40.301 --> 02:17:41.134
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I want to do it for your health.</v>

3413
02:18:20.291 --> 02:18:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking about those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

3414
02:18:22.930 --> 02:18:25.480
<v Speaker 1>we definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about power lifting</v>

3415
02:18:25.481 --> 02:18:26.860
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about my numbers.</v>

3416
02:18:26.861 --> 02:18:29.140
<v Speaker 1>I want to lift heavy weights</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently,</v>

3417
02:18:29.470 --> 02:18:32.080
<v Speaker 1>but I don't care what the single rep</v>
<v Speaker 1>maxes anymore.</v>

3418
02:18:32.081 --> 02:18:32.914
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3419
02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about your diet and its</v>

3420
02:18:36.881 --> 02:18:40.090
<v Speaker 1>impact on inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you ever think that if you got on</v>

3421
02:18:40.091 --> 02:18:42.130
<v Speaker 1>this diet when you were younger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have had to get hip</v>

3422
02:18:42.131 --> 02:18:42.750
<v Speaker 1>replacements?</v>

3423
02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

3424
02:18:44.140 --> 02:18:46.630
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I did when I was younger,</v>

3425
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:47.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3426
02:18:48.310 --> 02:18:48.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3427
02:18:48.971 --> 02:18:53.971
<v Speaker 1>it's about a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really is about a decline and I'm in</v>

3428
02:18:54.071 --> 02:18:54.811
<v Speaker 1>tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3429
02:18:54.811 --> 02:18:58.720
<v Speaker 1>he'd decline in cartilage tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where it was there when I was young</v>

3430
02:18:59.050 --> 02:19:02.920
<v Speaker 1>and then it started disappearing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time I was 28 years old,</v>

3431
02:19:02.921 --> 02:19:05.590
<v Speaker 1>it was completely gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is because of inflammation and</v>

3432
02:19:05.591 --> 02:19:08.560
<v Speaker 1>because of arthritis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really no reason for it.</v>

3433
02:19:08.561 --> 02:19:11.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my doctor said that lifting didn't cause</v>

3434
02:19:11.051 --> 02:19:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might have sped it up.</v>

3435
02:19:12.850 --> 02:19:16.210
<v Speaker 1>The fact that I needed to get the double</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip replacement surgery,</v>

3436
02:19:16.211 --> 02:19:17.560
<v Speaker 1>but he said like this isn't something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3437
02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:20.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting a weight causes like a natural</v>

3438
02:19:20.920 --> 02:19:23.590
<v Speaker 1>process in your body where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's breaking down,</v>

3439
02:19:23.591 --> 02:19:24.424
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3440
02:19:24.460 --> 02:19:28.490
<v Speaker 1>So I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know a good test will five years</v>

3441
02:19:28.491 --> 02:19:30.230
<v Speaker 1>from now how I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3442
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:32.570
<v Speaker 1>because I have other joints in my body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them.</v>

3443
02:19:32.910 --> 02:19:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I was just going to ask you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are your shoulders?</v>

3444
02:19:34.701 --> 02:19:35.560
<v Speaker 1>How are your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3445
02:19:35.950 --> 02:19:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I screwed up my shoulder and I tore my</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotator cuff and I tore my tricep a</v>

3446
02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:44.180
<v Speaker 1>while back and they never really heal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healed properly,</v>

3447
02:19:44.181 --> 02:19:45.500
<v Speaker 1>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an issue.</v>

3448
02:19:45.970 --> 02:19:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of my other joints that</v>

3449
02:19:48.111 --> 02:19:51.290
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are injured are all fine and feel good</v>

3450
02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:51.880
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3451
02:19:51.880 --> 02:19:53.030
<v Speaker 1>So what about your needs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3452
02:19:53.031 --> 02:19:56.150
<v Speaker 1>my knees were when I had got my hip</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgery 10 years ago.</v>

3453
02:19:56.470 --> 02:19:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctor said to me,</v>

3454
02:19:58.041 --> 02:20:01.010
<v Speaker 1>your knees are next and they need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>done probably like in a year.</v>

3455
02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:04.700
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he told me that when 10 years ago</v>

3456
02:20:04.900 --> 02:20:09.900
<v Speaker 1>he's got a Ferrari and I'm making</v>
<v Speaker 1>payments on that Condo in the Alps and</v>

3457
02:20:10.191 --> 02:20:11.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3458
02:20:11.301 --> 02:20:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

3459
02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:14.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

3460
02:20:14.271 --> 02:20:15.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think of when this was.</v>

3461
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I think like around when I finished</v>
<v Speaker 1>prescription thugs,</v>

3462
02:20:18.171 --> 02:20:20.690
<v Speaker 1>so maybe like two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3463
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:23.690
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to a doctor and I was just in so</v>

3464
02:20:23.691 --> 02:20:25.010
<v Speaker 1>much pain and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3465
02:20:25.011 --> 02:20:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't get back on opioids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

3466
02:20:26.900 --> 02:20:29.030
<v Speaker 1>that was my problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I need something.</v>

3467
02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:33.440
<v Speaker 1>What was the pain in everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every joint in my lower body from my,</v>

3468
02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:35.060
<v Speaker 1>like my ankles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my knees,</v>

3469
02:20:35.061 --> 02:20:37.250
<v Speaker 1>my hips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy basically just said,</v>

3470
02:20:37.251 --> 02:20:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you need to go get a full body MRI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I get a full body Mri and he tells me</v>

3471
02:20:40.761 --> 02:20:42.260
<v Speaker 1>that there's really nothing wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

3472
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:44.240
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're looking at,</v>

3473
02:20:44.241 --> 02:20:46.790
<v Speaker 1>but I can't walk in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

3474
02:20:46.820 --> 02:20:47.450
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you don't,</v>

3475
02:20:47.450 --> 02:20:48.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3476
02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:50.360
<v Speaker 1>like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have cartilage in your</v>

3477
02:20:50.361 --> 02:20:52.040
<v Speaker 1>knees that's going away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

3478
02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:54.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do have it in your ankles and you do</v>

3479
02:20:54.371 --> 02:20:56.750
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and didn't really offer me any</v>

3480
02:20:56.751 --> 02:20:57.290
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>

3481
02:20:57.290 --> 02:20:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And then that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was at that point where I realized</v>

3482
02:20:59.511 --> 02:21:01.460
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to do anything,</v>

3483
02:21:01.640 --> 02:21:03.260
<v Speaker 1>a doctor's not going to be the one to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help me,</v>

3484
02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of times people are</v>

3485
02:21:05.271 --> 02:21:06.350
<v Speaker 1>always so concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3486
02:21:06.740 --> 02:21:08.310
<v Speaker 1>did you ask a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm always like,</v>

3487
02:21:08.311 --> 02:21:10.210
<v Speaker 1>with doctors never really helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3488
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:11.980
<v Speaker 1>it's my cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's helping me.</v>

3489
02:21:11.981 --> 02:21:14.690
<v Speaker 1>It's me researching things that caused</v>
<v Speaker 1>me pain,</v>

3490
02:21:14.691 --> 02:21:15.920
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really helped me,</v>

3491
02:21:15.921 --> 02:21:16.754
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3492
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:18.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

3493
02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:20.330
<v Speaker 1>that's what I had to do was go out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for it myself.</v>

3494
02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you,</v>

3495
02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:25.520
<v Speaker 1>do you ever go back to that doctor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

3496
02:21:25.521 --> 02:21:27.200
<v Speaker 1>hey motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 10 years later,</v>

3497
02:21:27.201 --> 02:21:28.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm still walking and now I don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>any pain.</v>

3498
02:21:29.060 --> 02:21:31.220
<v Speaker 1>I should go back to him and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

3499
02:21:31.221 --> 02:21:32.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>

3500
02:21:32.271 --> 02:21:34.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they screwed up my hip and they left.</v>

3501
02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:37.250
<v Speaker 1>They left a bad hip and me for two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

3502
02:21:37.251 --> 02:21:40.100
<v Speaker 1>And then I went to the doctor and I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my doctor and I said,</v>

3503
02:21:40.101 --> 02:21:42.140
<v Speaker 1>doc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is debilitating.</v>

3504
02:21:42.890 --> 02:21:45.410
<v Speaker 1>And so he takes a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tissue box and he throws it on the</v>

3505
02:21:45.411 --> 02:21:47.180
<v Speaker 1>ground and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick that up.</v>

3506
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:49.100
<v Speaker 1>And I pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

3507
02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:51.740
<v Speaker 1>you're using the wrong terminology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not debilitating.</v>

3508
02:21:51.741 --> 02:21:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be able to pick that up.</v>

3509
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:57.110
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was the rudest thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever heard a doctor do or say like</v>

3510
02:21:57.111 --> 02:21:58.730
<v Speaker 1>ruthless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like really?</v>

3511
02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:00.130
<v Speaker 1>So I'm using the wrong word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but big.</v>

3512
02:22:00.250 --> 02:22:02.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't pick something up off the floor.</v>

3513
02:22:02.810 --> 02:22:05.210
<v Speaker 1>It hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was trying to tell him like,</v>

3514
02:22:05.211 --> 02:22:06.410
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand this hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

3515
02:22:06.411 --> 02:22:07.221
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not hurt,</v>

3516
02:22:07.221 --> 02:22:09.110
<v Speaker 1>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually told me to go back to the</v>

3517
02:22:09.111 --> 02:22:11.140
<v Speaker 1>gym and start lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

3518
02:22:11.180 --> 02:22:13.310
<v Speaker 1>And then two years later he calls me</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and he says,</v>

3519
02:22:13.311 --> 02:22:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I know what's wrong with your hip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We screwed it up.</v>

3520
02:22:15.410 --> 02:22:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3521
02:22:16.581 --> 02:22:20.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's everything about column on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors on late night TV.</v>

3522
02:22:20.170 --> 02:22:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3523
02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:23.250
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the,</v>

3524
02:22:23.310 --> 02:22:25.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get as a way to get paid,</v>

3525
02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

3526
02:22:26.010 --> 02:22:26.843
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3527
02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:29.620
<v Speaker 2>But they fucked you up man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3528
02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Just sue the shit out of that asshole</v>
<v Speaker 2>tissue box.</v>

3529
02:22:32.371 --> 02:22:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Throwing douchebag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them.</v>

3530
02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.800
<v Speaker 2>Part of what happened to you too was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you had pain,</v>

3531
02:22:37.801 --> 02:22:38.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>

3532
02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:41.250
<v Speaker 2>that was preventing you from moving</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

3533
02:22:41.251 --> 02:22:41.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3534
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:44.550
<v Speaker 2>and then you just kind of stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you did some cardio stuff for</v>

3535
02:22:44.551 --> 02:22:46.950
<v Speaker 2>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you weren't able to squat,</v>

3536
02:22:46.951 --> 02:22:48.900
<v Speaker 2>bench deadlift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't able to get some full range</v>

3537
02:22:48.901 --> 02:22:50.880
<v Speaker 2>of motion and therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3538
02:22:50.881 --> 02:22:51.780
<v Speaker 2>use it or lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3539
02:22:51.781 --> 02:22:53.820
<v Speaker 2>You lost range of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When did the pain go away?</v>

3540
02:22:54.500 --> 02:22:55.320
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3541
02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:57.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm still on a lot of pain when I wake</v>
<v Speaker 2>up every morning.</v>

3542
02:22:57.510 --> 02:22:59.240
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes away when I,</v>

3543
02:22:59.490 --> 02:23:03.920
<v Speaker 2>the thing is that the diet has helped</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear up like a lot of inflammation.</v>

3544
02:23:03.930 --> 02:23:06.090
<v Speaker 2>It's also helped clear up a lot of body</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>

3545
02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:09.090
<v Speaker 2>which helps you get in a better and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>advantageous positions when you're</v>

3546
02:23:09.091 --> 02:23:09.840
<v Speaker 2>lifting.</v>

3547
02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:12.810
<v Speaker 2>You know that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't even bend down to dead lift</v>

3548
02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:14.820
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egg got would get in a way and all that</v>

3549
02:23:14.821 --> 02:23:16.140
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3550
02:23:16.141 --> 02:23:18.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get rid of those things and that helps a</v>

3551
02:23:18.481 --> 02:23:20.540
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Losing weight in general always is going</v>

3552
02:23:20.541 --> 02:23:23.490
<v Speaker 2>to improve health markers and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>always going to feel lighter and better,</v>

3553
02:23:23.491 --> 02:23:24.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most part.</v>

3554
02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:25.950
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3555
02:23:26.670 --> 02:23:29.160
<v Speaker 2>it was that this like losing weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I,</v>

3556
02:23:29.161 --> 02:23:33.090
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started taking Kratom with a ketogenetic</v>

3557
02:23:33.091 --> 02:23:37.050
<v Speaker 2>diet and really reduce my inflammation</v>
<v Speaker 2>is when I started feeling better.</v>

3558
02:23:37.051 --> 02:23:39.810
<v Speaker 2>So was sort of a combination of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>two things.</v>

3559
02:23:40.170 --> 02:23:44.130
<v Speaker 2>And I'm continuing to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a daily struggle.</v>

3560
02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:45.210
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't go away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3561
02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:46.490
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is because your osteoporosis</v>

3562
02:23:46.590 --> 02:23:49.110
<v Speaker 2>osteoarthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you woke up this morning,</v>

3563
02:23:49.220 --> 02:23:51.270
<v Speaker 2>what hard to get out of bed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3564
02:23:51.271 --> 02:23:52.230
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

3565
02:23:52.231 --> 02:23:54.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this morning I felt good.</v>

3566
02:23:54.030 --> 02:23:56.220
<v Speaker 2>So you have good days and bad days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3567
02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever fuck with hot yoga?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

3568
02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:01.800
<v Speaker 2>but I keep hearing you talk about it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep thinking like,</v>

3569
02:24:01.801 --> 02:24:03.180
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just something I have to go do.</v>

3570
02:24:03.310 --> 02:24:05.820
<v Speaker 2>I was wondering like how that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>affect your hips.</v>

3571
02:24:05.821 --> 02:24:08.500
<v Speaker 2>Like how you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have full range of motion?</v>

3572
02:24:08.501 --> 02:24:12.330
<v Speaker 2>I think I would probably feel great but</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I can't move enough to get in</v>

3573
02:24:12.331 --> 02:24:16.180
<v Speaker 2>those positions so I have to take like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pre yoga class to get into,</v>

3574
02:24:16.210 --> 02:24:18.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just take a yoga class and you do</v>

3575
02:24:18.121 --> 02:24:19.680
<v Speaker 2>your best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they always say that because</v>

3576
02:24:19.681 --> 02:24:23.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people in my class that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some serious issues that can't move</v>

3577
02:24:23.311 --> 02:24:26.910
<v Speaker 2>well or there's this one lady who goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she's fucking courageous man cause</v>

3578
02:24:26.911 --> 02:24:31.230
<v Speaker 2>this lady's so overweight and she goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>this yoga class and she does her best</v>

3579
02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:33.330
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see her and I,</v>

3580
02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:36.300
<v Speaker 2>I want to say something to her but I</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to say something to her.</v>

3581
02:24:36.300 --> 02:24:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to be the guy and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey you know for a giant lady you're</v>

3582
02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:42.930
<v Speaker 2>fucking putting it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I don't want to like,</v>

3583
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.943
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

3584
02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:46.860
<v Speaker 2>I say hi and I smile at her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she's courageous.</v>

3585
02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:51.330
<v Speaker 2>She's every bit of 400 5,500 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3586
02:24:51.331 --> 02:24:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Just guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is enormous,</v>

3587
02:24:53.070 --> 02:24:54.990
<v Speaker 2>but she does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She tries,</v>

3588
02:24:54.991 --> 02:24:55.621
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

3589
02:24:55.621 --> 02:24:56.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's got her arms up.</v>

3590
02:24:56.941 --> 02:24:58.740
<v Speaker 2>She's been in for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's doing her best.</v>

3591
02:24:59.370 --> 02:25:02.910
<v Speaker 2>And if you just keep showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll get better.</v>

3592
02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:05.370
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not going to be able to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>into those positions initially,</v>

3593
02:25:05.371 --> 02:25:08.280
<v Speaker 2>but if you keep showing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the hot yoga might help him</v>

3594
02:25:08.281 --> 02:25:09.180
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3595
02:25:09.570 --> 02:25:11.700
<v Speaker 2>when he's warmed up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you move around really well.</v>

3596
02:25:11.760 --> 02:25:13.260
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm sending work workout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

3597
02:25:13.261 --> 02:25:14.880
<v Speaker 2>oh fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm going to dead lift once he's</v>

3598
02:25:14.881 --> 02:25:15.630
<v Speaker 2>warmed up.</v>

3599
02:25:15.630 --> 02:25:17.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't warm up enough.</v>

3600
02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:18.533
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree,</v>

3601
02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:21.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're 100% in a yoga class where it's</v>

3602
02:25:21.031 --> 02:25:22.410
<v Speaker 2>already warm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That helps a lot.</v>

3603
02:25:22.411 --> 02:25:25.000
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to understand that the more</v>

3604
02:25:25.001 --> 02:25:27.310
<v Speaker 2>intense the exercise is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do,</v>

3605
02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:29.560
<v Speaker 2>the longer your warm up needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3606
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:32.800
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going for a two hour walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much warm up do you need?</v>

3607
02:25:32.801 --> 02:25:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Probably none.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one,</v>

3608
02:25:33.850 --> 02:25:35.500
<v Speaker 2>there's not a lot of intensity behind</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3609
02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:38.560
<v Speaker 2>But if you're trying to run a 40 meter</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprints,</v>

3610
02:25:38.950 --> 02:25:41.440
<v Speaker 2>then you better warm up for a half an</v>
<v Speaker 2>hour and probably minimum.</v>

3611
02:25:41.441 --> 02:25:43.810
<v Speaker 2>So you don't tear a hamstring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with trying to bench heavy or</v>

3612
02:25:43.811 --> 02:25:46.810
<v Speaker 2>squat heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just the exercise itself either.</v>

3613
02:25:46.811 --> 02:25:50.170
<v Speaker 2>That's a mistake I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to warm up on with</v>

3614
02:25:50.171 --> 02:25:51.340
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with other means.</v>

3615
02:25:51.341 --> 02:25:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And the easiest way to warm up is</v>
<v Speaker 2>through your upper body.</v>

3616
02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:57.610
<v Speaker 2>So you go in the gym and you can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>curls and shoulder stuff if your</v>

3617
02:25:57.611 --> 02:25:59.010
<v Speaker 2>shoulders healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3618
02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:01.240
<v Speaker 2>that's the fastest way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Skier is a great way.</v>

3619
02:26:01.241 --> 02:26:03.130
<v Speaker 2>That's fastest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easiest way to warm up your body is</v>

3620
02:26:03.131 --> 02:26:05.820
<v Speaker 2>through the upper body a lot of times</v>
<v Speaker 2>are our needs.</v>

3621
02:26:06.130 --> 02:26:07.720
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well cause like your knees and your</v>

3622
02:26:07.721 --> 02:26:09.610
<v Speaker 2>lower back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just in general,</v>

3623
02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:12.340
<v Speaker 2>this is an everybody but in general a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people,</v>

3624
02:26:12.610 --> 02:26:14.680
<v Speaker 2>the knees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lower back and some of those things</v>

3625
02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:19.000
<v Speaker 2>are going to take time to warm up and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can warm up faster just by,</v>

3626
02:26:19.090 --> 02:26:21.760
<v Speaker 2>just by getting the upper body to move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3627
02:26:21.761 --> 02:26:24.490
<v Speaker 2>when you utilize your upper body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get your heart rate up a little bit</v>

3628
02:26:24.491 --> 02:26:27.460
<v Speaker 2>faster and it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more comfortable.</v>

3629
02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:29.170
<v Speaker 2>It's just easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's easier for me to say,</v>

3630
02:26:29.171 --> 02:26:29.921
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3631
02:26:29.921 --> 02:26:31.570
<v Speaker 2>hold this band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull it apart,</v>

3632
02:26:31.900 --> 02:26:33.010
<v Speaker 2>do these curls.</v>

3633
02:26:34.300 --> 02:26:36.550
<v Speaker 2>He just move your arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw some punches,</v>

3634
02:26:36.551 --> 02:26:38.230
<v Speaker 2>like who can't throw punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3635
02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:41.710
<v Speaker 2>Anyone can throw some punches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you guys can throw any good ones.</v>

3636
02:26:41.890 --> 02:26:42.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3637
02:26:42.430 --> 02:26:43.600
<v Speaker 2>you can't do any good ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3638
02:26:43.660 --> 02:26:45.350
<v Speaker 2>but you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you move around.</v>

3639
02:26:45.380 --> 02:26:47.200
<v Speaker 2>That's how you warm yourself up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm so old.</v>

3665
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:49.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anything the kids are doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>these days.</v>

3666
02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I just found out about a little bee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know shit.</v>

3667
02:27:52.790 --> 02:27:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people should be going on a 10 minute</v>

3668
02:27:54.701 --> 02:27:55.900
<v Speaker 2>walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's low hanging fruit.</v>

3669
02:27:55.901 --> 02:27:58.750
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just try one a day.</v>

3670
02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.180
<v Speaker 2>It's not hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One thing I like to do is body weight</v>

3671
02:28:01.181 --> 02:28:02.860
<v Speaker 2>squats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To do those Hindu squats,</v>

3672
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:05.260
<v Speaker 2>I'll do a set of a hundred and it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets everything warmed up.</v>

3673
02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:08.020
<v Speaker 2>Everything League,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your legs burning pretty bad in a</v>

3674
02:28:08.021 --> 02:28:08.950
<v Speaker 2>weird spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3675
02:28:08.951 --> 02:28:11.320
<v Speaker 2>Like your quads near your knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Upper knee?</v>

<v Speaker 2>connects.</v>

3679
02:28:15.551 --> 02:28:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Where your quad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that handy spot.</v>

3680
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:18.760
<v Speaker 2>What about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about a wall?</v>

3681

<v Speaker 2>How come a wall sit so hard?</v>

3682
02:28:20.590 --> 02:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard.</v>

3683

<v Speaker 3>It was brutal.</v>

3684
02:28:23.811 --> 02:28:25.570
<v Speaker 3>It was the hardest fucking exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't,</v>

3685
02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:28.730
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in karate they would have you stand at a</v>

3686
02:28:28.731 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 3>horse stance for long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like this.</v>

3687
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Just standing at horse dance like how</v>
<v Speaker 3>hard could this be?</v>

3688
02:28:34.390 --> 02:28:36.530
<v Speaker 3>A minute and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh shit.</v>

3696
02:28:53.091 --> 02:28:54.140
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a karate thing.</v>

02:28:54.141 --> 02:28:55.700
<v Speaker 3>That was in taekwondo.</v>

02:29:01.221 --> 02:29:01.970
<v Speaker 3>it's Cobra Kai.</v>

3702
02:29:01.970 --> 02:29:05.680
<v Speaker 3>It's a show about the Cobra Kai.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Netflix that's about the bags</v>

3703
02:29:05.690 --> 02:29:09.290
<v Speaker 3>and Netflix on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Ralph Machos in it and he comes in</v>

3704

<v Speaker 3>and he has a competing Dojo I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old is Ralph Macho now?</v>

3705

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3707

<v Speaker 3>Let me see the strike hard.</v>

3708
02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:26.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>terrible punches.</v>

3710
02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:30.710
<v Speaker 3>It was teaching these people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No mercy.</v>

3711
02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:33.400
<v Speaker 3>Is there any particular way you want me</v>
<v Speaker 3>to</v>

3712
02:29:37.450 --> 02:29:39.800
<v Speaker 3>shut them out with that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut that off right now.</v>

3713
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:41.430
<v Speaker 3>That was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

3714
02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:45.560
<v Speaker 3>That is the fucking trailer we need an</v>
<v Speaker 3>MMA movie.</v>

3715
02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:47.680
<v Speaker 3>Get to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was one warrior,</v>

3716
02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Brian town was in that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only problem with that movie is they</v>

3717
02:29:51.051 --> 02:29:54.500
<v Speaker 3>had people fight over a couple of days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just like shut the fuck up.</v>

3718
02:29:54.800 --> 02:29:57.140
<v Speaker 3>They did a bunch of stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They didn't have to do in that movie.</v>

3719
02:29:57.410 --> 02:30:00.020
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have people.</v>

3720
02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:03.080
<v Speaker 3>You can have people fight more than a</v>
<v Speaker 3>one time and the night.</v>

3721
02:30:03.370 --> 02:30:06.320
<v Speaker 3>But if you really think someone can get</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a bra and then you've never seen</v>

3722
02:30:06.321 --> 02:30:08.870
<v Speaker 3>anybody fight and then see what they</v>
<v Speaker 3>look like the next day.</v>

3723
02:30:09.170 --> 02:30:12.440
<v Speaker 3>Cause I remember when Ken shamrock</v>
<v Speaker 3>fought Tito Ortiz and then I ran into</v>

3724
02:30:12.441 --> 02:30:13.310
<v Speaker 3>him the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3725
02:30:13.330 --> 02:30:16.910
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his whole face was swollen up.</v>

3726
02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:20.090
<v Speaker 3>He had sunglasses on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that guy is not fighting any today,</v>

3727
02:30:20.250 --> 02:30:21.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he would,</v>

3728
02:30:21.171 --> 02:30:23.540
<v Speaker 3>he's a fucking animal but that's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>healthy.</v>

3729
02:30:23.810 --> 02:30:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Like your body's dealing with all that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like when they fight more</v>

3730
02:30:26.541 --> 02:30:29.630
<v Speaker 3>than one time in the night and they got</v>
<v Speaker 3>away with that back in the day.</v>

3731
02:30:29.631 --> 02:30:32.980
<v Speaker 3>And I know glory still does that for</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the kickboxing tournaments,</v>

3732
02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:34.310
<v Speaker 3>but it's his fucking dangerous.</v>

3733
02:30:34.570 --> 02:30:37.190
<v Speaker 3>It's just not smart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys get concussed and then they fight</v>

3734
02:30:37.191 --> 02:30:39.140
<v Speaker 3>again an hour later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two hours later.</v>

3735
02:30:39.141 --> 02:30:41.660
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Smashing machine was a fucking awesome</v>

3736
02:30:41.661 --> 02:30:43.520
<v Speaker 3>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite documentary ever.</v>

3737
02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:46.940
<v Speaker 3>That is my top and that's an accidental</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

3738
02:30:46.970 --> 02:30:49.010
<v Speaker 3>That's when I was documentaries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Amazing Doc.</v>

3739
02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:54.120
<v Speaker 3>That is a lot like that movie icarus</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they started to do one thing and</v>

3740
02:30:54.261 --> 02:30:57.710
<v Speaker 3>then a long yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they found something way fucking crazy.</v>

3741
02:30:57.711 --> 02:30:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's uh,</v>

3742
02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:02.990
<v Speaker 3>a documentary around Mark Kerr who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the scariest mma fighters of all</v>

3743
02:31:02.991 --> 02:31:07.991
<v Speaker 3>time and he was Jews to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there was such an ironic thing with</v>

3744
02:31:10.341 --> 02:31:14.210
<v Speaker 3>him where he was an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was so afraid to actually fight,</v>

3745
02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:15.910
<v Speaker 3>which was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where that,</v>

3746
02:31:15.911 --> 02:31:20.580
<v Speaker 3>that was such an interesting angle you'd</v>
<v Speaker 3>say before he goes out to the cage every</v>

3747
02:31:20.581 --> 02:31:23.300
<v Speaker 3>time he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can barely take a sip of water because</v>

3748
02:31:23.310 --> 02:31:26.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm so nervous because that kills</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

3749
02:31:26.160 --> 02:31:29.400
<v Speaker 3>I was around when Mark Kerr first</v>
<v Speaker 3>started competing.</v>

3750
02:31:29.610 --> 02:31:31.230
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the first guys that ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>saw,</v>

3751
02:31:31.231 --> 02:31:34.650
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was a gi and they used to call him</v>

3752
02:31:34.651 --> 02:31:37.590
<v Speaker 3>the specimen for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they called them the smashing</v>

3753
02:31:37.591 --> 02:31:38.760
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

3754
02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:41.940
<v Speaker 3>he's the first guy that ever saw that</v>
<v Speaker 3>submitted someone with a look of that</v>

3755
02:31:42.090 --> 02:31:45.600
<v Speaker 3>shit the fuck out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3756
02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:46.750
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can improve that.</v>

3757
02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:49.740
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but look at that.</v>

3758
02:31:49.741 --> 02:31:52.920
<v Speaker 3>Just keep that up there for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those traps when he was a,</v>

3759
02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:55.830
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty at the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he submitted someone with a chin to the</v>

3760
02:31:55.831 --> 02:31:58.680
<v Speaker 3>eye socket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He held the back of the dude's head and</v>

3761
02:31:58.681 --> 02:32:02.300
<v Speaker 3>got his chin and the guy's eye socket</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're fucking drove his chin into</v>

3762
02:32:02.320 --> 02:32:05.010
<v Speaker 3>his eye socket Dan [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3763
02:32:05.011 --> 02:32:07.110
<v Speaker 3>first time I ever saw somebody submit</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that way.</v>

3764
02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:10.200
<v Speaker 3>But seriously everybody asks me what my</v>
<v Speaker 3>favorite documentary is cause that's</v>

3765
02:32:10.201 --> 02:32:10.770
<v Speaker 3>what I do.</v>

3766
02:32:10.770 --> 02:32:13.590
<v Speaker 3>And without even hesitation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always say smashing machine.</v>

3767
02:32:13.650 --> 02:32:15.870
<v Speaker 3>It's a great documentary on so many</v>
<v Speaker 3>levels.</v>

3768
02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:18.660
<v Speaker 3>It really reminded me of our older</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother.</v>

3769
02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:21.480
<v Speaker 3>He reminded me a lot of mad dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3770
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:24.000
<v Speaker 3>Mark her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you know he had a substance abuse</v>

3771
02:32:24.001 --> 02:32:27.600
<v Speaker 3>problem and he was also like a guy at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time.</v>

3772
02:32:27.601 --> 02:32:31.740
<v Speaker 3>It was the early days of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was fighting back when it was</v>

3773
02:32:31.800 --> 02:32:34.950
<v Speaker 3>just crazy raw bare knuckles and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3774
02:32:34.951 --> 02:32:39.540
<v Speaker 3>fighting in these weird rings and Shammy</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was the early,</v>

3775
02:32:39.540 --> 02:32:41.610
<v Speaker 3>early days of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever read the book blood in the</v>

3776
02:32:41.611 --> 02:32:44.190
<v Speaker 3>cage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read some of it's really good.</v>

3777
02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:47.910
<v Speaker 3>I never feel like you had pat on a last</v>
<v Speaker 3>week and actually wanted to do,</v>

3778
02:32:47.940 --> 02:32:51.060
<v Speaker 3>I still want to do a film with Pat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a scripted film.</v>

3779
02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:53.580
<v Speaker 3>We had been talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about it a long time ago and</v>

3780
02:32:53.581 --> 02:32:55.710
<v Speaker 3>now I'm starting started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>started adding a little bit of clout.</v>

3781
02:32:55.710 --> 02:32:59.190
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm starting to talk about it again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his life was insane.</v>

3782
02:32:59.220 --> 02:33:03.750
<v Speaker 3>He had two brothers that died and one</v>
<v Speaker 3>brother that ended up going to jail for</v>

3783
02:33:03.751 --> 02:33:07.440
<v Speaker 3>like 15 years and he was the runt of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>family and he ended up becoming the</v>

3784
02:33:07.441 --> 02:33:11.790
<v Speaker 3>first ever UFC lightweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is just overcoming adversity like</v>

3785
02:33:11.791 --> 02:33:13.260
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing story.</v>

3786
02:33:13.290 --> 02:33:15.900
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pats neck was so fucked up that his</v>

3787
02:33:15.901 --> 02:33:18.630
<v Speaker 3>discs fuse together on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3788
02:33:18.720 --> 02:33:21.990
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so much degeneration of his disks</v>

3789
02:33:22.170 --> 02:33:25.770
<v Speaker 3>that the two bones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they sat on top of each other for so</v>

3790
02:33:25.771 --> 02:33:28.920
<v Speaker 3>long that they fused the port where</v>
<v Speaker 3>people accused him of having an</v>

3791
02:33:28.921 --> 02:33:32.130
<v Speaker 3>operation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he had an issue where a doctor said</v>

3792
02:33:32.131 --> 02:33:34.380
<v Speaker 3>that he had an operations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had a fucking operation like</v>

3793
02:33:34.381 --> 02:33:38.400
<v Speaker 3>your neck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fucking boone's the two bones.</v>

3794
02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:41.040
<v Speaker 3>They have no disc in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another fuse together.</v>

3795
02:33:41.100 --> 02:33:43.170
<v Speaker 3>I've never even heard of that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever heard of that before?</v>

3796
02:33:43.320 --> 02:33:44.760
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking tough.</v>

3797
02:33:44.761 --> 02:33:48.300
<v Speaker 3>You have to be to deal with kind of pain</v>
<v Speaker 3>where your neck is fusing itself.</v>

3798
02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:51.270
<v Speaker 3>Your neck is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this asshole is not going to go to a</v>

<v Speaker 3>so we're going to be the doctor.</v>

3800
02:33:53.310 --> 02:33:56.010
<v Speaker 3>When you see what he went through a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's probably one of the toughest people</v>

3801
02:33:56.011 --> 02:33:56.740
<v Speaker 3>and the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Never happened again.</v>

3813
02:34:16.801 --> 02:34:18.130
<v Speaker 3>What's great about that book.</v>

<v Speaker 1>where can people get it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3832
02:34:57.401 --> 02:34:59.350
<v Speaker 1>hopefully it will be on like Netflix,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>

3833
02:34:59.351 --> 02:34:59.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3834
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:01.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure exactly where it will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

3835
02:35:01.600 --> 02:35:05.580
<v Speaker 1>We've partnered with the orchard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the distribution companies.</v>

3836
02:35:05.581 --> 02:35:07.900
<v Speaker 1>So right now they're in the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out where it will be.</v>

3837
02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll let everybody know.</v>

3838
02:35:09.580 --> 02:35:12.100
<v Speaker 1>It'll be on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably start out to tell you the truth</v>

3839
02:35:12.101 --> 02:35:14.590
<v Speaker 1>on itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal route.</v>

3840
02:35:14.770 --> 02:35:15.610
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3841
02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:17.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let it play on itunes for a while</v>

3842
02:35:17.591 --> 02:35:18.790
<v Speaker 1>and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

3843
02:35:18.791 --> 02:35:21.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole system to it because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes money in different ways,</v>

3844
02:35:21.941 --> 02:35:22.980
<v Speaker 1>different places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3845
02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for documentary film</v>
<v Speaker 1>makers,</v>

3846
02:35:25.680 --> 02:35:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Netflix is sort of your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your graveyard at the end because</v>

3847
02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:31.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you want it to be on Netflix</v>

3848
02:35:31.391 --> 02:35:33.970
<v Speaker 1>because everybody has access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a film maker,</v>

3849
02:35:33.971 --> 02:35:38.230
<v Speaker 1>they really shaft you can because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll buy the like,</v>

3850
02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:43.030
<v Speaker 1>so they buy the film from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution company and then like all</v>

3851
02:35:43.031 --> 02:35:45.400
<v Speaker 1>that money just goes back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>investor and then,</v>

3852
02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:46.330
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get,</v>

3853
02:35:46.331 --> 02:35:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any money out of it.</v>

3854
02:35:47.350 --> 02:35:50.680
<v Speaker 1>So the only way to make documentaries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make them profitable and make them</v>

3855
02:35:50.681 --> 02:35:51.820
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cheap.</v>

3856
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:53.770
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times we don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we ended up,</v>

3857
02:35:54.120 --> 02:35:55.960
<v Speaker 1>you end up losing some money on it a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times,</v>

3858
02:35:55.961 --> 02:35:58.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's just the way it works.</v>

3859
02:35:59.260 --> 02:36:00.490
<v Speaker 1>This nutrition movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3860
02:36:00.570 --> 02:36:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Find that millionaire money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 100%.</v>

3861
02:36:03.790 --> 02:36:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3862
02:36:05.710 --> 02:36:07.900
<v Speaker 1>the advantage of doing a food</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries,</v>

3863
02:36:07.901 --> 02:36:10.210
<v Speaker 1>they do really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it would a food documentary,</v>

3864
02:36:10.211 --> 02:36:12.040
<v Speaker 1>you have a chance to really make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>

3865
02:36:12.041 --> 02:36:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Where as the other stuff it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really difficult.</v>

3866
02:36:14.650 --> 02:36:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Did you gotten the term meathead</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire yet?</v>

<v Speaker 1>did really well and it did really well.</v>

3873
02:36:28.930 --> 02:36:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Bryan Fogel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3874
02:36:30.191 --> 02:36:34.060
<v Speaker 1>but that is a groundbreaking boss life</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing documentary.</v>

3875
02:36:34.061 --> 02:36:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Also things break out like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that might be,</v>

3876
02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:38.680
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was involved,</v>

3877
02:36:38.810 --> 02:36:39.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we did bigger,</v>

3878
02:36:39.671 --> 02:36:40.481
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>

3879
02:36:40.481 --> 02:36:43.070
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't an international scandal</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on right.</v>

3880
02:36:43.210 --> 02:36:45.250
<v Speaker 1>That we were sorta happened to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>following.</v>

3881
02:36:45.251 --> 02:36:46.420
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3882
02:36:46.421 --> 02:36:47.171
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

3883
02:36:47.171 --> 02:36:48.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>

3884
02:36:48.071 --> 02:36:48.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got,</v>

3885
02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:50.950
<v Speaker 1>he got lucky with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also made a great film.</v>

3886
02:36:50.980 --> 02:36:52.690
<v Speaker 1>He took it and made it into something</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

3887
02:36:52.990 --> 02:36:54.340
<v Speaker 1>So I think that was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

3888
02:36:54.341 --> 02:36:55.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3889
02:36:55.730 --> 02:36:58.270
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was what a crazy movie that was.</v>

3890
02:36:58.271 --> 02:36:58.691
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't,</v>

3891
02:36:58.691 --> 02:37:00.550
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have something like that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

3892
02:37:00.670 --> 02:37:03.520
<v Speaker 1>We didn't have somebody like admitting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to steroids that was like huge.</v>

3893
02:37:03.521 --> 02:37:04.311
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3894
02:37:04.311 --> 02:37:07.600
<v Speaker 1>when it came out at Sundance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of a shocker to a lot of</v>

3895
02:37:07.601 --> 02:37:08.860
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is at Sundance.</v>

3896
02:37:08.861 --> 02:37:10.520
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe this,</v>

3897
02:37:10.860 --> 02:37:11.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Sundance.</v>

3898
02:37:12.040 --> 02:37:13.690
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it did really well.</v>

3899
02:37:13.691 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It got really good reviews.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did really well,</v>

3900
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.490
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't have that like one thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that broke it out and made it super size</v>

3901
02:37:19.491 --> 02:37:19.941
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3902
02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:21.530
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was something missing,</v>

3903
02:37:21.650 --> 02:37:23.630
<v Speaker 3>some element where every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3904
02:37:23.631 --> 02:37:25.460
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a thing that everybody had to</v>
<v Speaker 3>see.</v>

3905
02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:27.830
<v Speaker 3>Although it was a really great film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

3906
02:37:27.831 --> 02:37:30.060
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just didn't have that one thing that</v>

3907
02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:31.250
<v Speaker 3>was really great as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3908
02:37:31.251 --> 02:37:34.480
<v Speaker 3>you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he got super lucky while he was doing,</v>

3909
02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:35.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could see what I'm saying now.</v>

3910
02:37:35.790 --> 02:37:38.420
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had to see it because of this thing,</v>

3911
02:37:38.421 --> 02:37:38.841
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3912
02:37:38.841 --> 02:37:40.850
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's always the thing about</v>

3913
02:37:40.851 --> 02:37:43.430
<v Speaker 3>cheating in the Olympic Games,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always been suspected,</v>

3914
02:37:43.431 --> 02:37:48.170
<v Speaker 3>but to get it so confirmed where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>have the guy that did it and he's</v>

3915
02:37:48.171 --> 02:37:51.410
<v Speaker 3>running from the Russian mob or the</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever you want to call them,</v>

3916
02:37:51.620 --> 02:37:52.910
<v Speaker 3>and they're trying to fucking kill him.</v>

3917
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:53.230
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3918
02:37:53.230 --> 02:37:55.970
<v Speaker 3>he's in hiding.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's still in hiding to this day in</v>

3919
02:37:55.971 --> 02:37:58.250
<v Speaker 3>America in protective custody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're looking for him.</v>

3920
02:37:58.430 --> 02:37:59.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're looking for him.</v>

3921
02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:01.700
<v Speaker 3>I think it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's crazy.</v>

3922
02:38:01.701 --> 02:38:04.490
<v Speaker 3>First of all that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did the film and I think secondly,</v>

3923
02:38:04.491 --> 02:38:06.390
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3924
02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:11.130
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't even a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 3>protected in the least by the film</v>

3925
02:38:11.131 --> 02:38:12.670
<v Speaker 3>maker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought the film maker kind of throw</v>

3926
02:38:12.680 --> 02:38:16.550
<v Speaker 3>him under the bus a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's just how so are you wanted to</v>

3927
02:38:16.551 --> 02:38:17.384
<v Speaker 3>be in the film?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3928
02:38:17.460 --> 02:38:17.941
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

3929
02:38:17.941 --> 02:38:19.700
<v Speaker 3>it was weird though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It started to feel weird.</v>

3930
02:38:20.630 --> 02:38:22.030
<v Speaker 3>I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3931
02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like the daddy of protected by</v>

3932
02:38:25.351 --> 02:38:27.950
<v Speaker 3>changing is named that the Russians knew</v>
<v Speaker 3>who he was.</v>

3933
02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:28.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3934
02:38:28.480 --> 02:38:29.360
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3935
02:38:29.361 --> 02:38:30.830
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3936
02:38:31.940 --> 02:38:32.410
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>

3937
02:38:32.410 --> 02:38:34.400
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was a little reckless as</v>
<v Speaker 3>a filmmaker,</v>

3938
02:38:34.460 --> 02:38:35.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like it was a,</v>

3939
02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:39.080
<v Speaker 3>what would you do differently?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's tell you the truth.</v>

3940
02:38:39.081 --> 02:38:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know what I would do</v>

3941
02:38:41.151 --> 02:38:42.350
<v Speaker 3>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just felt like,</v>

3942
02:38:42.351 --> 02:38:45.080
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this like as I'm watching it going like,</v>

3943
02:38:45.081 --> 02:38:46.400
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's going to get in a lot of</v>

3944
02:38:46.401 --> 02:38:48.050
<v Speaker 3>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's going to get killed because of</v>

3945
02:38:48.051 --> 02:38:49.590
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He threw me in so I don't,</v>

3946
02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:51.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I did.</v>

3947
02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:52.011
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I do.</v>

3948
02:38:52.011 --> 02:38:55.610
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'm just talking out my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you weren't like rigging the</v>

3949
02:38:55.611 --> 02:38:59.330
<v Speaker 3>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what changed after that was that the</v>

3950
02:38:59.331 --> 02:39:02.630
<v Speaker 3>Russians essentially are barred from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Olympics and now they compete in the</v>

3951
02:39:02.631 --> 02:39:04.250
<v Speaker 3>Olympic final.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's interesting is we,</v>

3952
02:39:04.251 --> 02:39:08.330
<v Speaker 3>they had don Catlin in there and Don</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catlin guy for America that does the</v>

3953
02:39:08.331 --> 02:39:09.380
<v Speaker 3>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he?</v>

3954
02:39:09.410 --> 02:39:11.420
<v Speaker 3>And he was gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was gonna be the first guy I</v>

3955
02:39:11.421 --> 02:39:13.070
<v Speaker 3>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then he backed out and he said,</v>

3956
02:39:13.071 --> 02:39:15.320
<v Speaker 3>I'll give you the Russian guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause he knew the Russian guy,</v>

3957
02:39:15.321 --> 02:39:17.060
<v Speaker 3>he taught does it for America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>

3958
02:39:17.061 --> 02:39:21.410
<v Speaker 3>he's the guy that's our doping control.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he are doping control guy.</v>

3959
02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:22.970
<v Speaker 3>He's our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our um,</v>

3960
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.730
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you saw a guy or he,</v>

3961
02:39:24.731 --> 02:39:28.790
<v Speaker 3>he's a guy that did all the drug test</v>
<v Speaker 3>for the Olympics from like the eighties</v>

3962
02:39:28.791 --> 02:39:32.180
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's not the guy that dopes up the</v>

3963
02:39:32.181 --> 02:39:35.150
<v Speaker 3>American Nazi doesn't really clearly he</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't dope them up.</v>

3964
02:39:35.151 --> 02:39:38.450
<v Speaker 3>He's the guy that tests them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should tell people what ecourses too</v>

3965
02:39:38.480 --> 02:39:39.440
<v Speaker 3>if they don't know what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

3966
02:39:39.441 --> 02:39:43.010
<v Speaker 3>So this would be a standalone podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's documentary that Bryan Fogel made</v>

3967
02:39:43.011 --> 02:39:48.011
<v Speaker 3>where he decided to rice rice a ride his</v>
<v Speaker 3>bike in a race.</v>

3968
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:50.540
<v Speaker 3>So clean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely clean,</v>

3969
02:39:50.541 --> 02:39:54.080
<v Speaker 3>and then do it on steroids to see what</v>
<v Speaker 3>his times would be,</v>

3970
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:55.580
<v Speaker 3>how much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much benefit it would have.</v>

3971
02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:58.250
<v Speaker 3>And in the process of him filming this</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary,</v>

3972
02:39:58.251 --> 02:39:59.690
<v Speaker 3>the guy who hooked him up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>

3973
02:39:59.691 --> 02:40:03.800
<v Speaker 3>gregory from Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who was the head unbeknownst to him of</v>

3974
02:40:03.801 --> 02:40:06.890
<v Speaker 3>the Russian state sponsored doping</v>
<v Speaker 3>program,</v>

3975
02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:11.060
<v Speaker 3>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he thought he was getting a guy who was</v>

3976
02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 3>like the rush and you saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was going to tell him what</v>

3977
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:17.160
<v Speaker 1>the cheaters use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it turned out along the way,</v>

3978
02:40:17.161 --> 02:40:19.620
<v Speaker 1>everything got exposed and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3979
02:40:19.621 --> 02:40:21.870
<v Speaker 1>I did this for 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dope everybody,</v>

3980
02:40:21.871 --> 02:40:23.910
<v Speaker 1>everybody on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like he said,</v>

3981
02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:27.960
<v Speaker 1>every fucking single athlete that was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Olympics was on some shit.</v>

3982
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:30.000
<v Speaker 1>And then he explained how they did it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>

3983
02:40:30.001 --> 02:40:33.030
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they were going to pull the</v>

3984
02:40:33.031 --> 02:40:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing that he exposed</v>

3985
02:40:34.651 --> 02:40:39.330
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collusion between water and the IOC</v>

3986
02:40:39.420 --> 02:40:42.460
<v Speaker 1>and that they all work for each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they switched fucking rolls and they</v>

3987
02:40:42.461 --> 02:40:45.720
<v Speaker 1>go back and forth to each other and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to punish the Russians</v>

3988
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:48.770
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what they're doing now is they kind</v>

3989
02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:50.850
<v Speaker 1>of have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all of that movie,</v>

3990
02:40:50.910 --> 02:40:53.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean that movie literally changed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics.</v>

3991
02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:54.750
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I'm saying is when I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

3992
02:40:54.751 --> 02:40:55.501
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>

3993
02:40:55.501 --> 02:40:57.660
<v Speaker 1>and we're going around and talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the experts,</v>

3994
02:40:57.720 --> 02:40:59.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the experts,</v>

3995
02:40:59.790 --> 02:41:01.170
<v Speaker 1>they would mention gone catlin.</v>

3996
02:41:01.170 --> 02:41:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up with Don Catlin?</v>

3997
02:41:02.521 --> 02:41:03.810
<v Speaker 1>And they'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

3998
02:41:03.811 --> 02:41:06.390
<v Speaker 1>if you get him to talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the sports world will just</v>

3999
02:41:06.391 --> 02:41:08.540
<v Speaker 1>crumble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody kept saying it like,</v>

4000
02:41:08.541 --> 02:41:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I heard it from like four to people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

4001
02:41:10.260 --> 02:41:11.093
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experts.</v>

4002
02:41:11.310 --> 02:41:15.630
<v Speaker 1>They just said like nobody would believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in sports if that guy expose what he</v>

4003
02:41:15.631 --> 02:41:17.790
<v Speaker 1>knew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then I interviewed Don Catlin,</v>

4004
02:41:17.791 --> 02:41:19.390
<v Speaker 1>but he just laughed when I asked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

4005
02:41:19.391 --> 02:41:20.610
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know what they're talking</v>

4006
02:41:20.611 --> 02:41:21.031
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4007
02:41:21.031 --> 02:41:22.590
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're to know,</v>

4008
02:41:23.930 --> 02:41:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you guys later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

4009
02:41:25.561 --> 02:41:25.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

4010
02:41:25.921 --> 02:41:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Charles East St Louis is an expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

4011
02:41:27.991 --> 02:41:30.870
<v Speaker 1>the whole sports will crumble if they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they knew what you knew,</v>

4012
02:41:30.900 --> 02:41:32.100
<v Speaker 1>what do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

4013
02:41:32.101 --> 02:41:34.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you're not,</v>

4014
02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you're never going to get an answer like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4015
02:41:36.901 --> 02:41:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Something has to get exposed through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>

4016
02:41:38.880 --> 02:41:43.080
<v Speaker 1>So I shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say without a ship,</v>

4017
02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:45.420
<v Speaker 1>without a shadow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond a shadow of a doubt that that's</v>

4018
02:41:45.421 --> 02:41:48.030
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I suspicious of that guy,</v>

4019
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and suspicious of our system.</v>

4020
02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they're the only ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

4021
02:41:52.380 --> 02:41:56.790
<v Speaker 1>There's no way that the only ones doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that China had a record number of gold</v>

4022
02:41:56.791 --> 02:42:00.150
<v Speaker 1>medals when they hosted it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing it just as bad as they are.</v>

4023
02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:01.940
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4024
02:42:01.950 --> 02:42:03.450
<v Speaker 1>we're doing it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we're not,</v>

4025
02:42:03.451 --> 02:42:04.500
<v Speaker 1>we're not getting caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

4026
02:42:04.990 --> 02:42:08.530
<v Speaker 1>so when you say we as a country state</v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsored a marrow,</v>

4027
02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:08.831
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4028
02:42:08.831 --> 02:42:09.664
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no program.</v>

4029
02:42:10.460 --> 02:42:13.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't think state sponsored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd think like maybe some people</v>

4030
02:42:13.531 --> 02:42:16.380
<v Speaker 1>doing something somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some sort of network,</v>

4031
02:42:16.381 --> 02:42:19.350
<v Speaker 1>some shenanigans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one balco there's 10.</v>

4032
02:42:20.430 --> 02:42:21.990
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be more than one bowel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4033
02:42:22.110 --> 02:42:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be more than one guy</v>

4034
02:42:24.031 --> 02:42:26.280
<v Speaker 1>that's like telling people what to take.</v>

4035
02:42:27.960 --> 02:42:29.850
<v Speaker 1>A lot of that shit out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But listen,</v>

4036
02:42:29.851 --> 02:42:31.710
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep me posted on your movie.</v>

4037
02:42:31.770 --> 02:42:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Let us know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this nutrition,</v>

4038
02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:35.440
<v Speaker 1>do you have a name for it yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4039
02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:37.290
<v Speaker 1>we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been talking about on carbs.</v>

4040
02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:38.630
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about the war cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

4041
02:42:38.640 --> 02:42:40.680
<v Speaker 1>we've been debating whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right,</v>

4042
02:42:40.830 --> 02:42:44.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a very catchy things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially now because people are so</v>

4043
02:42:44.191 --> 02:42:45.600
<v Speaker 1>aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that are</v>

4044
02:42:45.601 --> 02:42:48.210
<v Speaker 1>switching to low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high fat diets and having some pretty</v>

4045
02:42:48.211 --> 02:42:50.280
<v Speaker 1>spectacular results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4046
02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:52.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of evidence behind it.</v>

4047
02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:53.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you,</v>

4048
02:42:53.780 --> 02:42:56.970
<v Speaker 1>you were saying before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see somebody take all these</v>

4049
02:42:56.971 --> 02:43:01.200
<v Speaker 1>diets and compare them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they did that in the 70s or the 80s,</v>

4050
02:43:01.201 --> 02:43:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I forget when it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Dr. Gardner from Stanford and he</v>

4051
02:43:05.461 --> 02:43:07.500
<v Speaker 1>was a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he took a Vegan diet,</v>

4052
02:43:07.501 --> 02:43:08.460
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian diet.</v>

4053
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:10.680
<v Speaker 1>The Atkins Diet was the Diet at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

4054
02:43:10.681 --> 02:43:12.610
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a Keto Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4055
02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:16.540
<v Speaker 1>the dash diet and the ornish diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And He'd put them all together and they</v>

4056
02:43:16.541 --> 02:43:18.430
<v Speaker 1>did a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pretty big elaborate,</v>

4057
02:43:18.431 --> 02:43:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how big it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4058
02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty elaborate study.</v>

4059
02:43:21.790 --> 02:43:24.040
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Atkins Diet,</v>

4060
02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:27.370
<v Speaker 1>basically one most weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best health marker improvement,</v>

4061
02:43:27.730 --> 02:43:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Atkins Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy who was a vegetarian and he</v>

4062
02:43:29.921 --> 02:43:33.010
<v Speaker 1>said at the end of the study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a really tough pill to swallow.</v>

4063
02:43:33.730 --> 02:43:35.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's a really interesting</v>

4064
02:43:35.261 --> 02:43:36.460
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did this study.</v>

4065
02:43:36.530 --> 02:43:38.930
<v Speaker 4>Did you know that Atkins had a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 4>heart attacks?</v>

4066
02:43:39.800 --> 02:43:43.610
<v Speaker 4>Coronary heart disease is 258 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he died.</v>

4067
02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:45.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

4068
02:43:45.210 --> 02:43:48.020
<v Speaker 4>someone was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well heard that stuff wasn't true</v>

4069
02:43:48.021 --> 02:43:48.831
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

4070
02:43:48.831 --> 02:43:49.221
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

4071
02:43:49.221 --> 02:43:50.060
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

4072
02:43:50.270 --> 02:43:50.700
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

4073
02:43:50.700 --> 02:43:53.660
<v Speaker 4>that's how big he was when he died.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it definitely had heart disease.</v>

4074
02:43:53.780 --> 02:43:55.790
<v Speaker 4>So it definitely did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the question is,</v>

4075
02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:59.990
<v Speaker 4>did he have heart disease before he did</v>
<v Speaker 4>this diet was even on his own diet.</v>

4076
02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:02.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was his diet based on science and fact</v>

4077
02:44:02.871 --> 02:44:03.351
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

4078
02:44:03.351 --> 02:44:07.250
<v Speaker 4>and efficacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But did he follow it or did he just eat</v>

4079
02:44:07.251 --> 02:44:07.830
<v Speaker 4>ice cream?</v>

4080
02:44:07.830 --> 02:44:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Fuck off all day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

4081
02:44:09.390 --> 02:44:10.670
<v Speaker 1>But he died by hitting his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4082
02:44:10.671 --> 02:44:11.400
<v Speaker 1>It fell on his head.</v>

4083
02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:14.610
<v Speaker 4>Fell and hit his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But see,</v>

4084
02:44:14.970 --> 02:44:18.630
<v Speaker 4>this all came from a tweak that I read</v>
<v Speaker 4>from John Joseph from the Cro mags,</v>

4085
02:44:18.631 --> 02:44:23.631
<v Speaker 4>who's a pretty rampant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a rabid vegan and a bad ass,</v>

4086
02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:26.190
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>triathlete and very,</v>

4087
02:44:26.191 --> 02:44:27.720
<v Speaker 4>very athletic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4088
02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:29.230
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

4089
02:44:29.350 --> 02:44:31.080
<v Speaker 4>he is the one that said that and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh wow.</v>

4090
02:44:31.081 --> 02:44:33.330
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said that the guy died of a heart</v>

4091
02:44:33.331 --> 02:44:35.580
<v Speaker 4>attack and that his wife was covering it</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

4092
02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:40.050
<v Speaker 4>So I went to look into it and it's very</v>
<v Speaker 4>difficult to say because,</v>

4093
02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:43.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even snopes had as inconclusive.</v>

4094
02:44:43.480 --> 02:44:44.031
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4095
02:44:44.031 --> 02:44:45.180
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh.</v>

4096
02:44:45.330 --> 02:44:48.030
<v Speaker 4>Like he might have had a heart attack</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fell and hit his head.</v>

4097
02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:49.920
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the guy had heart disease,</v>

4098
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:51.250
<v Speaker 4>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

4099
02:44:51.450 --> 02:44:53.700
<v Speaker 4>some people have heart disease and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>congenital.</v>

4100
02:44:53.701 --> 02:44:55.920
<v Speaker 4>They're born with issues and there is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

4101
02:44:55.921 --> 02:44:58.350
<v Speaker 4>there are people that are more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

4102
02:44:58.380 --> 02:45:00.120
<v Speaker 4>they're just more likely to have heart</v>
<v Speaker 4>attacks,</v>

4103
02:45:00.300 --> 02:45:03.330
<v Speaker 4>just like to some people that are more</v>
<v Speaker 4>likely to have strokes and more likely</v>

4104
02:45:03.331 --> 02:45:05.820
<v Speaker 4>to have arthritis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just issues that people have.</v>

4105
02:45:06.090 --> 02:45:08.520
<v Speaker 4>So we don't know whether or not he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>born with that.</v>

4106
02:45:08.521 --> 02:45:11.610
<v Speaker 4>If he had that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also if he's at 258 pounds,</v>

4107
02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:15.690
<v Speaker 4>he clearly isn't following it's fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>diet unless he's a giant.</v>

4108
02:45:15.970 --> 02:45:17.010
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old was he?</v>

4109
02:45:17.490 --> 02:45:19.320
<v Speaker 4>He was an old guy and he's in his</v>
<v Speaker 4>seventies,</v>

4110
02:45:19.321 --> 02:45:20.640
<v Speaker 4>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe late sixties.</v>

4111
02:45:20.820 --> 02:45:21.810
<v Speaker 4>Find it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull,</v>

4112
02:45:21.811 --> 02:45:22.860
<v Speaker 4>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pull up the,</v>

4113
02:45:22.861 --> 02:45:25.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Wiki on him on,</v>

4114
02:45:25.981 --> 02:45:27.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

4115
02:45:27.450 --> 02:45:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Dr. Atkins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was his name</v>

4116
02:45:29.400 --> 02:45:30.900
<v Speaker 1>from Robert?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Atkins.</v>

4117
02:45:30.901 --> 02:45:32.550
<v Speaker 1>Robert Atkins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know how he died?</v>

4118
02:45:32.640 --> 02:45:33.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing.</v>

4119
02:45:33.211 --> 02:45:34.044
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4120
02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy.</v>

4121
02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:38.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Diet that he created is</v>

4122
02:45:38.881 --> 02:45:40.320
<v Speaker 1>different than the actual guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4123
02:45:40.321 --> 02:45:41.790
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know if he was doing his</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

4124
02:45:41.791 --> 02:45:45.240
<v Speaker 1>So we call that the people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing this diet that were in the study.</v>

4125
02:45:45.390 --> 02:45:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ended up coming out on top as well.</v>

4126
02:45:47.011 --> 02:45:50.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying the guy who created crossfit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not in shape.</v>

4127
02:45:50.820 --> 02:45:51.653
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4128
02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:54.010
<v Speaker 1>you ever see him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4129
02:45:54.011 --> 02:45:55.260
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got some issues,</v>

4130
02:45:55.261 --> 02:45:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I believe some injuries and stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't allow him to do all this stuff to</v>

4131
02:45:58.741 --> 02:46:00.180
<v Speaker 1>crossfit does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4132
02:46:00.270 --> 02:46:01.103
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's</v>

4133
02:46:01.230 --> 02:46:04.380
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 72 when he died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>days prior to his death,</v>

4134
02:46:04.470 --> 02:46:07.260
<v Speaker 4>he fell and hit his head and see New</v>
<v Speaker 4>York pavement,</v>

4135
02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:09.020
<v Speaker 4>a New York's blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

4136
02:46:09.050 --> 02:46:09.411
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

4137
02:46:09.411 --> 02:46:11.840
<v Speaker 4>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Admitted April 8th he underwent surgery</v>

4138
02:46:11.841 --> 02:46:14.210
<v Speaker 4>to remove a blood clot in his brain but</v>
<v Speaker 4>went into a coma.</v>

4139
02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:17.780
<v Speaker 4>So we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it says that's how he fell and he</v>

4140
02:46:17.781 --> 02:46:20.150
<v Speaker 4>hit his head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know why he fell and it may</v>

4141
02:46:20.151 --> 02:46:23.180
<v Speaker 4>very well have been that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here it says metal exam has offered</v>

4142
02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:27.140
<v Speaker 4>her office a year after his death showed</v>
<v Speaker 4>that Atkins had a history of heart</v>

4143
02:46:27.141 --> 02:46:30.650
<v Speaker 4>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can jet congestive heart failure?</v>

4144
02:46:30.651 --> 02:46:34.380
<v Speaker 4>What does congestive heart failure and</v>
<v Speaker 4>hypertension ingestive means.</v>

4145
02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:35.390
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not good.</v>

4146
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:39.110
<v Speaker 4>His widow refuse to allow an autopsy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh that's interesting.</v>

4147
02:46:39.140 --> 02:46:42.770
<v Speaker 4>That is interesting because does Wa</v>
<v Speaker 4>widow refuse to allow an autopsy because</v>

4148
02:46:42.771 --> 02:46:47.450
<v Speaker 4>this guy wasn't healthy and maybe wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>even following his own advice,</v>

4149
02:46:47.451 --> 02:46:49.700
<v Speaker 4>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what was his weight when he died?</v>

4150
02:46:49.730 --> 02:46:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Maybe cause it's going to say that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

4151
02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:56.210
<v Speaker 4>his wife might've felt that he's going</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get ripped apart in his death and she</v>

4152
02:46:56.211 --> 02:46:57.870
<v Speaker 4>didn't want that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe 72 years old.</v>

4153
02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:00.520
<v Speaker 4>You can find out what his weight was</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he died.</v>

4154
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:05.060
<v Speaker 4>Cause I'm pretty sure he was 258 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're 258 pounds.</v>

4155
02:47:05.061 --> 02:47:07.910
<v Speaker 4>It's 72 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That shit ain't good.</v>

4156
02:47:09.170 --> 02:47:10.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it say is,</v>

4157
02:47:10.500 --> 02:47:14.780
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm very,</v>

4158
02:47:14.810 --> 02:47:16.730
<v Speaker 4>very sure that he was very heavy.</v>

4159
02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:21.290
<v Speaker 4>Robert Atkins,</v>
<v Speaker 4>258 pounds when he died.</v>

4160
02:47:21.410 --> 02:47:24.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure that's how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So here's the thing,</v>

4161
02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:26.510
<v Speaker 4>was that from the Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it does.</v>

4162
02:47:26.930 --> 02:47:29.600
<v Speaker 4>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if the guy's making people lose</v>

4163
02:47:29.601 --> 02:47:34.100
<v Speaker 4>weight on this diet and he himself is</v>
<v Speaker 4>fat and he himself has serious heart</v>

4164
02:47:34.101 --> 02:47:36.530
<v Speaker 4>failure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>258 pounds,</v>

4165
02:47:36.531 --> 02:47:40.610
<v Speaker 4>that is dell release report by New York</v>
<v Speaker 4>City officials outrage the act and</v>

4166
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:44.600
<v Speaker 4>Atkins people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he had a history of heart attacks and</v>

4167
02:47:44.601 --> 02:47:48.710
<v Speaker 4>congestive heart failure and 258 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I don't think he exercised.</v>

4168
02:47:48.711 --> 02:47:51.050
<v Speaker 4>I think he probably didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that doesn't mean anything.</v>

4169
02:47:51.080 --> 02:47:53.570
<v Speaker 4>I mean the over eight obviously too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's like,</v>

4170
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:56.480
<v Speaker 4>was the guy following his own advice?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't know.</v>

4171
02:47:56.680 --> 02:47:59.960
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think at this cream is tempting per</v>

4172
02:47:59.970 --> 02:48:02.180
<v Speaker 4>spaghetti's tempting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

4173
02:48:02.181 --> 02:48:04.280
<v Speaker 4>who doesn't like a good meatball sub</v>
<v Speaker 4>every now and again?</v>

4174
02:48:04.310 --> 02:48:04.850
<v Speaker 4>Who knows?</v>

4175
02:48:04.850 --> 02:48:07.820
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're all on this a race who can see</v>

4176
02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:09.620
<v Speaker 4>who's going to live the longest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4177
02:48:09.621 --> 02:48:11.060
<v Speaker 4>And I there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>

4178
02:48:11.450 --> 02:48:15.620
<v Speaker 4>there's still no like real conclusive</v>
<v Speaker 4>proof is there that one diet people can</v>

4179
02:48:15.650 --> 02:48:17.990
<v Speaker 4>live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but forget about the other longest</v>

4180
02:48:17.991 --> 02:48:19.160
<v Speaker 4>because that's really out of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>control.</v>

4181
02:48:19.161 --> 02:48:20.840
<v Speaker 4>What about the quality of life while</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're alive?</v>

4182
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:23.120
<v Speaker 4>That's what I think of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're 258 lbs,</v>

4183
02:48:23.121 --> 02:48:25.220
<v Speaker 4>your quality of life sucks unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>a giant.</v>

4184
02:48:25.730 --> 02:48:28.220
<v Speaker 4>Unless he's as big as Frances and Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

4185
02:48:28.250 --> 02:48:30.130
<v Speaker 4>I mean really literally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like in Ghana,</v>

4186
02:48:30.140 --> 02:48:31.910
<v Speaker 4>his weight class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How the fuck?</v>

4187
02:48:32.430 --> 02:48:33.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was,</v>

4188
02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:37.070
<v Speaker 4>is that how that big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's Atkins is fucking giant gorilla.</v>

4189
02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:38.113
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how was he?</v>

4190
02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:41.420
<v Speaker 4>How was he have 258 pounds?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not good.</v>

4191
02:48:41.440 --> 02:48:43.070
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quality of life.</v>

4192
02:48:43.071 --> 02:48:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm here,</v>

4193
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:47.210
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I'm going to get an extra two years,</v>

4194
02:48:47.211 --> 02:48:51.140
<v Speaker 4>but I'm going to be like weak and feeble</v>
<v Speaker 4>and not able to do anything,</v>

4195
02:48:51.141 --> 02:48:54.740
<v Speaker 4>like what are those two years' worth?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It I feel that the best diet is the one</v>

4196
02:48:54.741 --> 02:48:57.890
<v Speaker 4>you can follow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And utilizing a ketogenic style diet and</v>

4197
02:48:57.891 --> 02:49:00.950
<v Speaker 4>utilizing intermittent fasting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it helps kill hunger.</v>

4198
02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:05.330
<v Speaker 4>I think it helps kill cravings.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I think it's a diet that in my</v>

4199
02:49:05.331 --> 02:49:07.980
<v Speaker 4>opinion one of the easier diets to to it</v>
<v Speaker 4>might be hard</v>

4200
02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.440
<v Speaker 3>for some people that really like carbs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they might have to find something</v>

4201
02:49:10.441 --> 02:49:11.620
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

4202
02:49:11.670 --> 02:49:14.070
<v Speaker 3>but for me it's always worked for him</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's always worked well.</v>

4203
02:49:14.071 --> 02:49:17.550
<v Speaker 3>He is essential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Atkins Diet did put people into ketosis.</v>

4204
02:49:17.900 --> 02:49:19.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fed.</v>

4205
02:49:19.180 --> 02:49:21.960
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't really the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goal of it.</v>

4206
02:49:22.020 --> 02:49:26.130
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't a goal to get weird shit to</v>
<v Speaker 3>eat a lot of like bars and things like</v>

4207
02:49:26.131 --> 02:49:28.200
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You intake sugar,</v>

4208
02:49:28.201 --> 02:49:31.490
