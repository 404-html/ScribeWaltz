<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

7
00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>the wise ass kid who had awful grades,</v>

8
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:11.341
<v Speaker 1>I was on Ritalin,</v>

9
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:12.174
<v Speaker 1>I was a mess.</v>

10
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>And so Ritalin in high school who I was on Ritalin since like,</v>

11
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>like right at a preschool shit,</v>

13
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 1>you look at the early uh,</v>

14
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.930
<v Speaker 1>government documentation on,</v>

15
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.561
<v Speaker 1>on Rhydlin.</v>

16
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:23.394
<v Speaker 1>This is not a joke.</v>

17
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

18
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>there's these big books.</v>

19
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:25.531
<v Speaker 1>My mom had them,</v>

20
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>there's photos of me.</v>

21
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>They tried Ritalin out.</v>

22
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I was part of the test group home.</v>

23
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>We would get little orange tablets and then we get little yellow tablets and we</v>

24
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>have triangular orange tablets for awhile.</v>

25
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.991
<v Speaker 1>And My,</v>

26
00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>I went to a place called the national research center and I was a hyperactive</v>

27
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>kid and they said,</v>

28
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

29
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>here we're trying this stuff out.</v>

30
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:49.251
<v Speaker 1>My mom had me on Ritalin from like a preschool all the way to 12th grade.</v>

31
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

32
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>In the summertime,</v>

33
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>summer vacation,</v>

34
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't take it.</v>

35
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>And within a day that's of kicking herself out of your system,</v>

36
00:00:57.781 --> 00:00:58.081
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

37
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>your appetite comes back.</v>

38
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>And in ninth or 10th grade I started weightlifting and I started like throwing</v>

39
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 1>the pills out because it's a,</v>

40
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>it's an APP,</v>

41
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>it's speed.</v>

42
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>And so it suppresses your appetite.</v>

43
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm going through puberty,</v>

44
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>my hormones are raging and I stopped using the tablet and all of a sudden I'm</v>

45
00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:18.091
<v Speaker 1>that guy at lunch,</v>

46
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:18.441
<v Speaker 1>we're like the,</v>

47
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:18.691
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

48
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:18.931
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

49
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>the line of milk on the outer edge of the tray because I'm eating like,</v>

50
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>tons of food and the locust until I'm going to the gym and I'm just getting</v>

52
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

53
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.940
<v Speaker 1>my frustration is now being informed by a physicality that I'm getting by</v>

54
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker 1>lifting weights.</v>

55
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>So all of a sudden I'm putting muscle on and I'm angry at the world and I'm a</v>

56
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>spazz.</v>

57
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 1>And so by 12th grade I was kind of a maniac and then I got into punk rock and</v>

58
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:47.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>just got,</v>

60
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>got into that slug fest and just kind of went into the world just kind of wildly</v>

61
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>swinging away.</v>

62
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Who the eff,</v>

63
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>why did they put you on Ritalin at such a young age?</v>

64
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Because it's what they were doing in America with a lot of young people who talk</v>

65
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>too much or you know,</v>

66
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.730
<v Speaker 1>had that social skills well on energy and attention deficit and it couldn't</v>

67
00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:06.421
<v Speaker 1>concentrate.</v>

68
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And I got thrown out of the DC public school system,</v>

69
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.111
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:10.681
<v Speaker 1>for being,</v>

71
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>he's yelling,</v>

73
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>he's doing this and I actually read a couple of teachers reports about me years</v>

74
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.831
<v Speaker 1>later and I said,</v>

75
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I had no memory.</v>

76
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

77
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.230
<v Speaker 1>I did all that.</v>

78
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.741
<v Speaker 1>My mom went,</v>

79
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:20.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

80
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:21.100
<v Speaker 1>that's why they kicked you out.</v>

81
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>They kicked you out of school.</v>

82
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

83
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.481
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

85
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I got kicked out of a few schools until they put me in a,</v>

86
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>in a prep school where the advertising is like,</v>

87
00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.681
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

88
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 1>your kid has problems with studying will cool.</v>

89
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:35.474
<v Speaker 1>I'm out.</v>

90
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.211
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

91
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>the first few days of school,</v>

92
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:41.010
<v Speaker 1>some kids spoke at a class and I watched this one teacher picked this one kid up</v>

93
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>and just kind of toss him into a blackboard and went right in his class.</v>

94
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:45.144
<v Speaker 1>You shut up.</v>

95
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

96
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to get,</v>

97
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>a thrashing by a teacher.</v>

99
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>So I was always really careful.</v>

100
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>But having that difficulty sitting down and I was fine with topics I liked.</v>

101
00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

102
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't groove on math or any of that,</v>

104
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>but at lunchtime I'd go to the library and start memorizing the Latin</v>

105
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>nomenclature of every North American snake.</v>

106
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I had to learn them all and by like 10th grade I had,</v>

107
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>and I have most of it's still in my head,</v>

108
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>but I'm always very confused at these medical distinctions,</v>

109
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Adhd or hyperactive or add,</v>

110
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is like is,</v>

111
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.260
<v Speaker 1>is that real or do people just do,</v>

112
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>some people just have a different composition,</v>

113
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>a different passion inside of them and they resist doing things they don't want</v>

114
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>to do and they don't want to be a part of any structured school curriculum.</v>

115
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I think all of it,</v>

116
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.481
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

117
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:37.661
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

118
00:03:37.661 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>And is that a disease or is that,</v>

119
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>or do you just have more fucking and looking right now that don't have any</v>

120
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>pills,</v>

121
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>you're not on anything and yet you have all his passion for life.</v>

122
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>You have all this.</v>

123
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the same shit that you had when you were six?</v>

124
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

125
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.260
<v Speaker 1>it was undisciplined and unfocused type.</v>

126
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.771
<v Speaker 1>But that does that.</v>

127
00:03:51.771 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>It's not a disease.</v>

128
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

129
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

130
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

131
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it a disease,</v>

132
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>I think as this wiring.</v>

133
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.501
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

134
00:03:56.501 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>But why the fuck is it named?</v>

135
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Why is it Adh so they can,</v>

136
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>why is it so they can sell you a pill?</v>

137
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:01.241
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

138
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that crazy?</v>

139
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

140
00:04:02.601 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>you look back at your own life,</v>

141
00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you were on that shit for,</v>

142
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Nine years really screws with you.</v>

147
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can feel it when you take the,</v>

148
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.923
<v Speaker 1>the pill,</v>

149
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.823
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

150
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>you're basically,</v>

151
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>you're a propeller that spins so fast when it looks like they're like go spokes</v>

152
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:20.891
<v Speaker 1>of a wheel.</v>

153
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Like the wheels still,</v>

154
00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>it's actually going really fast.</v>

155
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>That's how it felt like on the outside I'm like this pale skinny,</v>

156
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.830
<v Speaker 1>like eh,</v>

157
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>but inside,</v>

158
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm like the last few minutes of,</v>

159
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

160
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Dave in 2001 where he's coming in spacetime in genuine,</v>

161
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>everything is flying by.</v>

162
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>That was like 10th grade for me.</v>

163
00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of held onto my desk and fairly flew through classes,</v>

164
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:50.071
<v Speaker 1>like not being able to retain much because I was just speeding my brains out and</v>

165
00:04:51.371 --> 00:04:54.430
<v Speaker 1>then the pill would wear off around dinner and all of a sudden you're like</v>

166
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>eating two meals and the next morning you take the pill and you don't eat again</v>

167
00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>for hours.</v>

168
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>That is fucking crazy.</v>

169
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>It was nuts and scares the shit out of me too because my parents didn't put me</v>

170
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>on anything like that,</v>

171
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>but I know I would've,</v>

172
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>I know I would've been diagnosed.</v>

173
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I know I would have been put on something if I had the wrong parents.</v>

174
00:05:13.451 --> 00:05:13.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

175
00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>they put me on,</v>

176
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>my mom put me on this stuff probably because my doctor said,</v>

177
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.043
<v Speaker 1>hey iris,</v>

179
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>this helps a lot of kids.</v>

180
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>But I was in these classes and I'll never forget one day I'm going through my</v>

181
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:27.731
<v Speaker 1>mom's books.</v>

182
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>There's just this big Honkin hardcover book and I opened it up and I saw these</v>

183
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>like a contact sheet of me.</v>

184
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

185
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.704
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

186
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>That's that place.</v>

187
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw the camera angle and I realized there were these mirrors on the</v>

188
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>

189
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>their observation rooms.</v>

190
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget one day I'm looking at that mirror and a door opened from the</v>

191
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:51.400
<v Speaker 1>side and my mom walked out and they would,</v>

192
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.430
<v Speaker 1>we were being observed and the camera angle was from that observation room.</v>

193
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And there's me playing with blocks and stuff.</v>

194
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

195
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I remember that sweater.</v>

196
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man,</v>

197
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like four.</v>

198
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And that was part of that research group.</v>

199
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

200
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.881
<v Speaker 1>And maybe,</v>

201
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>cause my mom was a government employee,</v>

202
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:10.573
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

203
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.061
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

204
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

205
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I went to a place called it like for two years called the national research</v>

206
00:06:14.721 --> 00:06:14.901
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

207
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I got thrown out of there wow.</v>

208
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 1>For wounding a kid,</v>

209
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>which due to him through a bunch of powdered cement in his face.</v>

210
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:32.580
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
