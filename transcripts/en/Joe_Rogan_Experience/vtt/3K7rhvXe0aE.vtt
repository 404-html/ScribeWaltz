16
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but regular microphones don't get nearly enough fucking credit.</v>

17
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>There's something sexy about those old school Frank Sinatra in the 1930s back</v>

18
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>when people were dumb as fuck.</v>

19
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.880

20
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.910
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a talk shit.</v>

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.891
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>if you click on that and entering the code word j r e,</v>

26
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>it was a special offer.</v>

27
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>You get all kinds of cool shit,</v>

28
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:59.751
<v Speaker 1>like a free scale and 80 bucks and $25 in postage coupons.</v>

29
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the website,</v>

30
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.981
<v Speaker 1>go to,</v>

31
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>go to stamps.com and then click on the thing and entering the code word jre.</v>

33
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>It'll fill you in on all the details.</v>

34
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.841
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

36
00:01:09.841 --> 00:01:10.081
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>the opera w the way it is.</v>

38
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:11.980

39
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 1>I have it says $110 bonus offer.</v>

40
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.993
<v Speaker 1>Why does it say $80?</v>

41
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 2>Because he normally just a normal person that goes to stamps.com he only gets</v>

42
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 2>that $80 a offer.</v>

43
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 2>But if you've typing or you click on that microphone and type in j Rue,</v>

44
00:01:23.471 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>you get a even better off.</v>

45
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Then you get $110.</v>

46
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:27.371
<v Speaker 2>I got confused.</v>

47
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

48
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.421
<v Speaker 1>did they lower it?</v>

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.180
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

297
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 6>You could make some money at it as the bonus is the,</v>

298
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:52.800
<v Speaker 6>but uh,</v>

299
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.680
<v Speaker 6>there is the artist side of it that it's like if I don't wake up and hustle</v>

300
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:57.680
<v Speaker 6>something out of nothing out of thin air,</v>

301
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.141
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

302
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 6>then rent might not get paid in six months.</v>

303
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:00.901
<v Speaker 6>That's true too.</v>

304
00:11:00.901 --> 00:11:02.640
<v Speaker 6>And we've all seen people drop off.</v>

305
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:03.271
<v Speaker 6>It's scary.</v>

306
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:03.961
<v Speaker 6>Once you're moving,</v>

307
00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 6>you've got to keep moving once you know,</v>

308
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.031
<v Speaker 6>more money,</v>

309
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:06.691
<v Speaker 6>more problems.</v>

310
00:11:06.691 --> 00:11:07.170
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

311
00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.840
<v Speaker 1>one other thing is I said something to Irish,</v>

312
00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.300
<v Speaker 1>whole lot of fucking problems.</v>

313
00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

314
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who doesn't want those problems,</v>

315
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.391
<v Speaker 1>don't be silly.</v>

316
00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:18.010
<v Speaker 1>They're better than the starving problems.</v>

317
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I was telling the army should fear that.</v>

318
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:20.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

319
00:11:20.621 --> 00:11:23.600
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about like writing material and we just,</v>

320
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.820
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the conversation,</v>

321
00:11:24.821 --> 00:11:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm realize I'm like,</v>

322
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

323
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're an Ra ship for your fan,</v>

324
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.710
<v Speaker 1>you're the only one who could deliver it.</v>

325
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:31.210
<v Speaker 1>Like it's your responsibility.</v>

326
00:11:31.211 --> 00:11:33.550
<v Speaker 1>You have like thousands of Ari Shaffir fans,</v>

327
00:11:33.551 --> 00:11:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but you're the only one who can deliver you like you a particular style of</v>

328
00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:38.951
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>

329
00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 1>You are what you look like,</v>

330
00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:41.080
<v Speaker 1>the way you speak.</v>

331
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.220
<v Speaker 1>It's either the only one,</v>

332
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.083
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

333
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:45.460
<v Speaker 1>So like for someone who's an Everlast fan,</v>

334
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.930
<v Speaker 1>you're the only one.</v>

335
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:47.740
<v Speaker 1>There's no other,</v>

336
00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.480
<v Speaker 1>there's no other Everlast out there.</v>

337
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.060
<v Speaker 1>You the only guy who can produce Everlast material.</v>

338
00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's like a giant responsibility.</v>

339
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a fan,</v>

340
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.470
<v Speaker 1>you want to tap into a dude is always creating new shit,</v>

341
00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:00.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:12:00.161 --> 00:12:00.491
<v Speaker 1>that way,</v>

343
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:00.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:01.840
<v Speaker 1>if you become a junkie,</v>

345
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.460
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a Leonard Skinner Junkie,</v>

346
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:05.260
<v Speaker 1>fuck man to sit,</v>

350
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.850
<v Speaker 1>But if you're an Everlast fan,</v>

356
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.063
<v Speaker 1>but thanks.</v>

357
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even trying to be like me.</v>

358
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm just trying to make sense of the whole fucking thing.</v>

359
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Cancer.</v>

360
00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen the,</v>

361
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:25.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

362
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's going down right now in Turkey?</v>

363
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what's happened to the riots?</v>

364
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.641
<v Speaker 1>Rebellion.</v>

365
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:31.990
<v Speaker 1>Massive rebellion and Turkey.</v>

366
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I have not read much about it.</v>

367
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

368
00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.380
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

369
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

370
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 1>they're saying it's some sort of like an occupier style revolt and I saw a photo</v>

371
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.201
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

372
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:44.260
<v Speaker 1>these people walking down the street and it's insane.</v>

373
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like some end of the world.</v>

374
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>

375
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like Brian,</v>

376
00:12:46.871 --> 00:12:47.860
<v Speaker 1>see if he could pull up the picture.</v>

377
00:12:47.861 --> 00:12:48.700
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

378
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:52.840
<v Speaker 1>This picture of these people were walking down the street together.</v>

379
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.441
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

380
00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 1>it was overflowing with people.</v>

381
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like everyone was out there marching in protests.</v>

382
00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:01.900
<v Speaker 1>It was like 100% of the people in the city and seeing them walking down the</v>

383
00:13:01.901 --> 00:13:02.071
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

384
00:13:02.071 --> 00:13:02.191
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

385
00:13:02.191 --> 00:13:03.430
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking craziness,</v>

386
00:13:03.431 --> 00:13:03.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

387
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't exactly know what the fuck the story as though.</v>

388
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.840
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of strange to me too.</v>

389
00:13:07.841 --> 00:13:08.200
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

390
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

391
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.971
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

392
00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:10.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's just my perception of things,</v>

393
00:13:10.541 --> 00:13:13.360
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like the less we are like that,</v>

394
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:15.780
<v Speaker 1>like our country that used to be that kind of country where there'd be,</v>

395
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.680
<v Speaker 1>we got in an uproar.</v>

396
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>They protested.</v>

397
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.753
<v Speaker 1>You know that though.</v>

398
00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it happens but let's keep it real.</v>

399
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't happen.</v>

400
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Like using the more,</v>

401
00:13:23.801 --> 00:13:26.050
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world takes advantage of their freedom.</v>

402
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Like the less we actually use ours at all.</v>

403
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Well I think we're just so soft.</v>

404
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 1>It's so sad when you're by like,</v>

405
00:13:33.371 --> 00:13:33.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

406
00:13:33.641 --> 00:13:35.930
<v Speaker 1>powdered donuts at 3:30 AM you know,</v>

407
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:37.780
<v Speaker 1>at the Ralph's every other block.</v>

408
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:38.380
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

409
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:38.650
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

410
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:39.483
<v Speaker 1>life gets easy.</v>

411
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:40.380
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

412
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.950
<v Speaker 1>that's not good for you to be,</v>

413
00:13:41.951 --> 00:13:43.100
<v Speaker 1>for things to be that easy,</v>

414
00:13:43.101 --> 00:13:43.390
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

415
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.770
<v Speaker 1>That's why like an easy job.</v>

416
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.780
<v Speaker 1>It's probably one of the worst things you should ever,</v>

417
00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:47.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

418
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't want an easy job.</v>

419
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't want something that you could just have brain it,</v>

420
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:55.330
<v Speaker 1>you will slowly rot away while these kids in Turkey or throwing Molotov</v>

421
00:13:55.331 --> 00:13:57.700
<v Speaker 1>cocktails at the cops and trying to take over the government.</v>

422
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.260
<v Speaker 1>You know those are,</v>

423
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

424
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:01.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's always going to be that,</v>

425
00:14:01.181 --> 00:14:01.450
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

426
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:02.980
<v Speaker 1>We wishing good luck to them or not.</v>

427
00:14:02.981 --> 00:14:03.310
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

428
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.031
<v Speaker 1>I said I'm not,</v>

429
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:05.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what I'm going to go.</v>

430
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go with yes.</v>

431
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Just because I'm a rebel.</v>

432
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm down with that.</v>

433
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.241
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

434
00:14:10.241 --> 00:14:11.050
<v Speaker 1>are you a rebel?</v>

435
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.030
<v Speaker 3>I am ready to go with,</v>

436
00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:12.391
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

437
00:14:12.391 --> 00:14:13.110
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

438
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.970
<v Speaker 3>We're done with the younger,</v>

439
00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.210
<v Speaker 3>you have a bomb on your hat.</v>

440
00:14:15.211 --> 00:14:17.220
<v Speaker 3>So funny by the way,</v>

441
00:14:17.221 --> 00:14:19.990
<v Speaker 3>and being on the airplane with his hat was really uncomfortable.</v>

442
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.660
<v Speaker 3>I forgot that I had it on and it's just like writing after the Boston bombings</v>

443
00:14:24.661 --> 00:14:25.021
<v Speaker 3>too.</v>

444
00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:25.471
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

445
00:14:25.471 --> 00:14:26.860
<v Speaker 3>why am I wearing this kind of taste?</v>

446
00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:28.743
<v Speaker 3>Good choice.</v>

447
00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Did you have the Cammo jacket to go with it?</v>

448
00:14:32.191 --> 00:14:32.501
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

449
00:14:32.501 --> 00:14:33.334
<v Speaker 3>Like a hunting.</v>

450
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.443
<v Speaker 3>Like a duck.</v>

451
00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:36.270
<v Speaker 3>The duck dynasty,</v>

452
00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:37.110
<v Speaker 3>like hunting jams</v>

453
00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:39.960
<v Speaker 3>with an empty scabbard.</v>

454
00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

455
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.270
<v Speaker 3>Check my sword.</v>

456
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>

457
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.820
<v Speaker 3>What about those fucking guys that just hacked the dude up and Oh yeah,</v>

458
00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.391
<v Speaker 3>in England.</v>

459
00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:49.320
<v Speaker 3>That to me was like,</v>

460
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.060
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is wrong with?</v>

461
00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.240
<v Speaker 3>And hope it's really crazy.</v>

462
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 6>If you seen the video of the guy talking to the camera.</v>

463
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.110
<v Speaker 6>I didn't hear the talking about the image but I didn't hear any of that.</v>

464
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

465
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Speaker 6>Like the rant or anything?</v>

466
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.311
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

467
00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:02.670
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what happened man.</v>

468
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.390
<v Speaker 6>But apparently it was something to do with religion.</v>

469
00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:05.841
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

470
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:06.081
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

471
00:15:06.081 --> 00:15:08.210
<v Speaker 6>I'm kind of know distant from religion.</v>

472
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.070
<v Speaker 6>I used to experiment and all kinds of them.</v>

473
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:12.660
<v Speaker 6>I don't reject any blue or a Muslim for a while.</v>

474
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.550
<v Speaker 6>Why am I mean?</v>

475
00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:13.911
<v Speaker 6>I won't,</v>

476
00:15:13.911 --> 00:15:14.744
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

477
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

478
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.420
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

479
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.800
<v Speaker 6>I don't practice cause I just don't believe in organized religion at this point.</v>

480
00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:19.250
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

481
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.730
<v Speaker 6>I believe,</v>

482
00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.400
<v Speaker 6>I do believe in God and I believe in a single creator and all that.</v>

483
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.820
<v Speaker 6>Damn.</v>

484
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.250
<v Speaker 6>But there's a lot of stories I don't believe in magic.</v>

485
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:25.910
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

486
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

487
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:26.571
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

488
00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:28.220
<v Speaker 6>you know what I think about religion.</v>

489
00:15:28.221 --> 00:15:28.371
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

490
00:15:28.371 --> 00:15:29.450
<v Speaker 6>when I was a young man,</v>

491
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 6>I was forced into Catholics and I don't believe in killing motherfuckers because</v>

492
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:34.880
<v Speaker 6>my shit is right and yours is wrong.</v>

493
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:35.720
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

494
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:40.100
<v Speaker 6>Unless it's you're breaking into my house trying to steal my shit then then I'm</v>

495
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:40.430
<v Speaker 6>a fair.</v>

496
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.030
<v Speaker 6>You're fair game.</v>

497
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.141
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

498
00:15:41.141 --> 00:15:41.440
<v Speaker 6>when I,</v>

499
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.900
<v Speaker 6>when I was a kid I was forced to go to Catholic school and I hated religion for</v>

500
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:46.910
<v Speaker 6>a long time after that and just thought it was ridiculous.</v>

501
00:15:46.911 --> 00:15:47.900
<v Speaker 6>The nuns were cons.</v>

502
00:15:47.901 --> 00:15:48.591
<v Speaker 6>It was a mess.</v>

503
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:49.220
<v Speaker 6>It was just,</v>

504
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.120
<v Speaker 6>I was raised Catholic.</v>

505
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.281
<v Speaker 6>I got a story to it.</v>

506
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:52.220
<v Speaker 6>Did you go to Catholic school?</v>

507
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:53.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

508
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.471
<v Speaker 6>so I've,</v>

509
00:15:53.471 --> 00:15:55.070
<v Speaker 6>I've for longest time,</v>

510
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:55.371
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

511
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:55.880
<v Speaker 6>go ahead.</v>

512
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm sorry for the line is time.</v>

513
00:15:57.411 --> 00:15:59.490
<v Speaker 6>After that I thought that religion was horse shit.</v>

514
00:15:59.510 --> 00:15:59.750
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

515
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.010
<v Speaker 6>I thought this is nothing in this.</v>

516
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.160
<v Speaker 6>But then as I got older I realized that it's just because I had a terrible</v>

517
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:04.971
<v Speaker 6>experience with it.</v>

518
00:16:04.971 --> 00:16:07.640
<v Speaker 6>And if you look at like a lot of the principles of religion,</v>

519
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 6>you got to decipher the fact that people been around for so long just telling</v>

520
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 6>stories and by the time it gets written on paper or people's try to twist</v>

521
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:15.171
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>

522
00:16:15.171 --> 00:16:18.140
<v Speaker 6>they're the way that they would like it to be when it comes to translations and</v>

523
00:16:18.141 --> 00:16:18.680
<v Speaker 6>things like that.</v>

524
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:19.940
<v Speaker 6>And it goes in different languages.</v>

525
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 6>But the core of it all,</v>

526
00:16:21.291 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 6>it's like people trying to figure out how to get along to connect.</v>

527
00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.380
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

528
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 6>People trying to figure out how to express love.</v>

529
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:29.060
<v Speaker 6>People trying to figure out how to,</v>

530
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.000
<v Speaker 6>how to treat one as you would like to be treated.</v>

531
00:16:32.001 --> 00:16:35.750
<v Speaker 6>You know like literally the tenants for life that people figured out before they</v>

532
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:38.090
<v Speaker 6>really knew much of anything about how the world works.</v>

533
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.640
<v Speaker 6>They had these ideas and they said they came from God.</v>

534
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:41.721
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

535
00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 6>and whether or not anybody had one on one experience with God.</v>

536
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

537
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.371
<v Speaker 6>I mean mate Shit,</v>

538
00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:47.660
<v Speaker 6>who the fuck knows it's there.</v>

539
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:49.730
<v Speaker 6>Just the at the earth exists at all.</v>

540
00:16:49.731 --> 00:16:51.570
<v Speaker 6>It's pretty fucking crazy as far as I'm concerned.</v>

541
00:16:51.571 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 6>It's nuts.</v>

542
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.551
<v Speaker 6>But I mean,</v>

543
00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:53.361
<v Speaker 6>I compare it to this.</v>

544
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:54.194
<v Speaker 6>It's like I,</v>

545
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't say I know anything about a god.</v>

546
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.920
<v Speaker 6>I have a sense that there's a higher power.</v>

547
00:16:57.921 --> 00:16:58.760
<v Speaker 6>I have a sense of it,</v>

548
00:16:58.761 --> 00:16:59.001
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

549
00:16:59.001 --> 00:16:59.834
<v Speaker 6>I feel like I do.</v>

550
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 6>I feel like there's something there.</v>

551
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:05.480
<v Speaker 6>But can I understand it or explain it or define it now man.</v>

552
00:17:05.481 --> 00:17:06.170
<v Speaker 6>Cause you know,</v>

553
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:06.770
<v Speaker 6>I always say,</v>

554
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:07.071
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

555
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:09.770
<v Speaker 6>somebody wants told me that's like your shoe defining you.</v>

556
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.280
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

557
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:10.461
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

558
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:13.370
<v Speaker 6>there's gotta be a line before between whatever a creator is.</v>

559
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:14.090
<v Speaker 6>And when the creation,</v>

560
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 6>I don't even assume it human characteristics anymore.</v>

561
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.530
<v Speaker 6>I just take it as like,</v>

562
00:17:18.531 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

563
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:20.480
<v Speaker 6>kind of like whatever energy I'm following.</v>

564
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 6>I never,</v>

565
00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 6>I never went to school for music.</v>

566
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.690
<v Speaker 6>You would to tell I was,</v>

567
00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 6>I never planned to do any of this shit with my life.</v>

568
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:27.300
<v Speaker 6>And I don't say go around.</v>

569
00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.250
<v Speaker 6>I'm not preaching or anything,</v>

570
00:17:28.251 --> 00:17:33.251
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying alls I did was follow a certain path in energy and led me through</v>

571
00:17:34.101 --> 00:17:34.940
<v Speaker 6>every religion.</v>

572
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.660
<v Speaker 6>It led me through every religion and by the time I got to Islam,</v>

573
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:39.110
<v Speaker 6>Aye.</v>

574
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.370
<v Speaker 6>Aye.</v>

575
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:39.860
<v Speaker 6>Aye.</v>

576
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:40.300
<v Speaker 6>Aye.</v>

577
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.190
<v Speaker 6>I took it into my life and it's primarily about peace and love.</v>

578
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:47.720
<v Speaker 6>And then there's all this other sub cultural crazy stuff that goes on in these</v>

579
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:48.230
<v Speaker 6>other places.</v>

580
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.770
<v Speaker 6>I approached it from a Western mind in a western philosophy of like just this is</v>

581
00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:54.090
<v Speaker 6>a philosophy to deal with.</v>

582
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:55.230
<v Speaker 6>It's not like my,</v>

583
00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:00.350
<v Speaker 6>my clan didn't get murdered by that guys Emam 14,000 or 1400 years ago.</v>

584
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:01.051
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

585
00:18:01.051 --> 00:18:04.950
<v Speaker 6>there's all these sub stuff that goes on between these Sophie's and Sunni's and,</v>

586
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.091
<v Speaker 6>and that's when I was like,</v>

587
00:18:06.091 --> 00:18:06.361
<v Speaker 6>you know what?</v>

588
00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:09.780
<v Speaker 6>Organized religion as a whole is garbage because it meant they're just</v>

589
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:10.720
<v Speaker 6>organization to it.</v>

590
00:18:10.721 --> 00:18:12.720
<v Speaker 6>Somebody in charge and then there's power struggle.</v>

591
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

592
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.560
<v Speaker 6>Whenever you put it in individual vantage,</v>

593
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.220
<v Speaker 6>religion should be mine.</v>

594
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:19.650
<v Speaker 6>It's not even up for discussion.</v>

595
00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:21.401
<v Speaker 6>And last,</v>

596
00:18:21.401 --> 00:18:22.520
<v Speaker 6>we're going to sit there and be like very,</v>

597
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.801
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

598
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:23.634
<v Speaker 6>unless there's no,</v>

599
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.870
<v Speaker 6>I sat down with you.</v>

600
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.870
<v Speaker 6>I know we could sit down and have a cool conversation,</v>

601
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.920
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

602
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.630
<v Speaker 6>there's also 400,000 people that listen to this or of millions of people that</v>

603
00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:34.464
<v Speaker 6>listen to this and,</v>

604
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:35.543
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

605
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.810
<v Speaker 6>you can't have a reasonable argument with every single one at the light.</v>

606
00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:39.321
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

607
00:18:39.321 --> 00:18:41.700
<v Speaker 6>I think that the idea of the organization,</v>

608
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:44.340
<v Speaker 6>like when you put something into a giant organization,</v>

609
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:45.420
<v Speaker 6>then you set rules up.</v>

610
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 6>All of a sudden things get weird,</v>

611
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:47.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

612
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.860
<v Speaker 6>that's when people get into power and its influence gets manipulated and,</v>

613
00:18:51.861 --> 00:18:52.251
<v Speaker 6>and the,</v>

614
00:18:52.251 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

615
00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.360
<v Speaker 6>like I tell people all the time,</v>

616
00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.360
<v Speaker 6>you can consider me Muslim,</v>

617
00:18:54.361 --> 00:18:54.901
<v Speaker 6>but I'll go out,</v>

618
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:55.531

620
00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:57.880

<v Speaker 6>But food is yummy.</v>

728
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:35.733
<v Speaker 6>It's delicious.</v>

729
00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:37.270
<v Speaker 6>The problems so good.</v>

730
00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:38.860
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>

731
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.680
<v Speaker 6>so you know,</v>

732
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.510
<v Speaker 6>I just wound up putting on weight.</v>

733
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:42.900
<v Speaker 6>What was the question there?</v>

734
00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 6>When I went into my second and my daughter and it's a whole nothing we just</v>

735
00:21:45.701 --> 00:21:46.534
<v Speaker 6>talking to about what?</v>

736
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 6>Martial arts you said.</v>

737
00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:48.760
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah I was doing Jujitsu.</v>

738
00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:48.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

739
00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:49.300
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

740
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.470
<v Speaker 6>And then after I put this weight on,</v>

741
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:50.771
<v Speaker 6>I went,</v>

742
00:21:50.771 --> 00:21:54.710
<v Speaker 6>I tried to go back and it's like with a spare tire trying to do hip throw.</v>

743
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:56.070
<v Speaker 6>You got it.</v>

744
00:21:56.071 --> 00:21:56.630
<v Speaker 6>Yeah man.</v>

745
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:57.870
<v Speaker 6>You know I was like no I got it.</v>

746
00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.260
<v Speaker 6>I got to do that.</v>

747
00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:02.200
<v Speaker 6>I got to drop some pounds to get back just so I can drop some pounds.</v>

748
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:04.930
<v Speaker 6>It's just treated as like an,</v>

749
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:08.110
<v Speaker 6>I mean you should probably get in shape before you do it,</v>

750
00:22:08.111 --> 00:22:10.660
<v Speaker 6>but you could treat it as some sort of a mental exercise.</v>

751
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:11.620
<v Speaker 6>Fire Yourself.</v>

752
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.220
<v Speaker 6>There's some torn.</v>

753
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.020
<v Speaker 6>If I make that move I was telling you about,</v>

754
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:14.321
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

755
00:22:14.321 --> 00:22:14.771
<v Speaker 6>I'll probably,</v>

756
00:22:14.771 --> 00:22:14.951
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

757
00:22:14.951 --> 00:22:18.070
<v Speaker 6>I'll be able to hit the Runyon canyon run and walks and stuff like that.</v>

758
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.911
<v Speaker 6>That's always fun.</v>

759
00:22:18.911 --> 00:22:19.650
<v Speaker 6>I liked that walk.</v>

760
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.280
<v Speaker 6>It's getting up to the top is a reward.</v>

761
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.081
<v Speaker 6>It's huge.</v>

762
00:22:22.081 --> 00:22:25.480
<v Speaker 6>I actually used to pull up and start at the top and walked down cause then you</v>

763
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 6>got to come back up and get your car.</v>

764
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:27.970
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

765
00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.370
<v Speaker 6>Caffeine and Jack Daniels also helps with weight loss.</v>

766
00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.580
<v Speaker 6>If you throw up a lung Caner,</v>

767
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 6>this was amazing.</v>

768
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.380
<v Speaker 6>It was just terrible for weight loss.</v>

769
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:36.560
<v Speaker 6>That's horrible.</v>

770
00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:37.394
<v Speaker 6>It's just sugar.</v>

771
00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah it is.</v>

772
00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.730
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately because of I drink whiskey,</v>

773
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 6>it turns right into sugar.</v>

774
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.293
<v Speaker 6>How weird.</v>

775
00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm not hastily.</v>

776
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:44.980
<v Speaker 6>I can't give that up.</v>

777
00:22:44.981 --> 00:22:47.860
<v Speaker 6>I need to guy who's going to show me how I can work around some of the feet.</v>

778
00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.330
<v Speaker 6>I think that it's,</v>

779
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.770
<v Speaker 6>it's all about moderation,</v>

780
00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.280
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

781
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.620
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you have to give up the whiskey.</v>

782
00:22:52.621 --> 00:22:53.470
<v Speaker 6>I think if you want to stay.</v>

783
00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.180
<v Speaker 6>Another thing is I stay steady.</v>

784
00:22:55.181 --> 00:22:55.510
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

785
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:56.041
<v Speaker 6>I I like,</v>

786
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:57.370
<v Speaker 6>I don't pass a certain point.</v>

787
00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.230
<v Speaker 6>You know what I like to 60 and it's like oh that's the,</v>

788
00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:01.181
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

789
00:23:01.181 --> 00:23:01.640
<v Speaker 6>That's too big.</v>

790
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.473
<v Speaker 6>Then you get mad.</v>

791
00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.880
<v Speaker 6>I get mad but I never,</v>

792
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.380
<v Speaker 6>I don't go like to like to 90 or 300 I did once I think like two 90 way back.</v>

793
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

794
00:23:09.130 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 6>wow.</v>

795
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.400
<v Speaker 6>But a lot of it too is like we were talking about thyroid earlier.</v>

796
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:12.611
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

797
00:23:12.611 --> 00:23:16.100
<v Speaker 6>after my surgery I have to take a thyroid pill to like keep my,</v>

798
00:23:16.101 --> 00:23:16.330
<v Speaker 6>my,</v>

799
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.440
<v Speaker 6>my metabolism just kinda just went when all the surgery and stuff happened,</v>

800
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 6>my body just kind of said we're going to slow life down.</v>

801
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.561
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

802
00:23:23.561 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 6>I would imagine that heart surgery.</v>

803
00:23:25.451 --> 00:23:27.480
<v Speaker 6>So I just need to find out how I can build back up.</v>

804
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.160
<v Speaker 6>I don't even need to do 90 x like full blast like that,</v>

805
00:23:30.161 --> 00:23:32.020
<v Speaker 6>but I didn't know what I'm saying.</v>

806
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:34.450
<v Speaker 6>But it's good because it makes you do it.</v>

807
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:34.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

808
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.560
<v Speaker 6>If you're going to eat it,</v>

809
00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:38.120
<v Speaker 6>it seems like it's too much then,</v>

810
00:23:38.121 --> 00:23:38.711
<v Speaker 6>then you know,</v>

811
00:23:38.711 --> 00:23:40.380
<v Speaker 6>do as much as you can and then stop button.</v>

812
00:23:40.381 --> 00:23:40.660
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

813
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.530
<v Speaker 6>But it makes you do it.</v>

814
00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:42.340
<v Speaker 6>Whatever.</v>

815
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.770
<v Speaker 6>You're going to find the dude that's going to take money to help me.</v>

816
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure</v>

817
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:46.810
<v Speaker 3>he could find it.</v>

818
00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.010
<v Speaker 3>You guys going show up at my door and be like,</v>

819
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:49.970
<v Speaker 3>Yo dude,</v>

820
00:23:49.971 --> 00:23:51.050
<v Speaker 3>get out of bed pussy.</v>

821
00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:55.260
<v Speaker 3>You want someone bad like that.</v>

822
00:23:55.261 --> 00:23:56.540
<v Speaker 3>That was going to be your willpower.</v>

823
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:56.930
<v Speaker 3>Then we'll,</v>

824
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:57.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

825
00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 3>we'll be fighting and he's probably going to be in much better shape for me.</v>

826
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going to have to break out a bat and it's like an assault charge and I</v>

827
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 3>got to buy him a car when I should have just,</v>

828
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.573
<v Speaker 3>I got in shape,</v>

829
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:08.110
<v Speaker 3>get Richard Simmons banding,</v>

830
00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 3>smoke a bunch of and have Richard Simmons help you out.</v>

831
00:24:10.731 --> 00:24:12.020
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like the best thing ever.</v>

832
00:24:12.021 --> 00:24:13.160
<v Speaker 3>You won't feel threatened by him.</v>

833
00:24:13.161 --> 00:24:14.430
<v Speaker 3>You would get to make your heart grow.</v>

834
00:24:14.431 --> 00:24:15.500
<v Speaker 3>Cause he's so heartwarming.</v>

835
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:18.200

836
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:19.093
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

837
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:22.070
<v Speaker 3>The greatest reality show as I might even,</v>

838
00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.630
<v Speaker 3>I might even say yeah to that</v>

839
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.950
<v Speaker 3>if that's all it was about [inaudible] I don't think he would ever would bust a</v>

840
00:24:30.951 --> 00:24:31.281
<v Speaker 3>move.</v>

841

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

843
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:36.770
<v Speaker 3>maybe when he was younger maybe it would have felt it and felt confident.</v>

877
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:17.830

883
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:28.703

<v Speaker 3>I know how to get there,</v>

885
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.130

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:41.720
<v Speaker 3>A throat cancer affect your pussy.</v>

893
00:25:41.721 --> 00:25:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Eating at all is a little shocking.</v>

894
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:44.690
<v Speaker 3>A little shocking,</v>

895
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.411
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

896
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:46.244
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

897
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:48.620
<v Speaker 3>cause I could swear I heard it a long time ago.</v>

898
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Like he first blamed it all on that kind of already suspected it.</v>

899
00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

900
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:52.701
<v Speaker 3>Maybe,</v>

901
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:54.080
<v Speaker 3>but I heard about just yesterday,</v>

902
00:25:54.081 --> 00:25:54.920
<v Speaker 3>I was first time I heard,</v>

903
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.650
<v Speaker 3>I just heard it yesterday and we're talking about in a while ago</v>

904
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.903
<v Speaker 6>on something.</v>

905
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.213
<v Speaker 6>Hmm.</v>

906
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.740
<v Speaker 6>Maybe.</v>

907
00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:01.960
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it's just that the,</v>

908
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.170
<v Speaker 6>maybe the media,</v>

909
00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:03.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

910
00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 6>it's picking up on it.</v>

911
00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:06.470
<v Speaker 6>The second run around,</v>

912
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

913
00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:08.060
<v Speaker 6>maybe you talked about it before,</v>

914
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 6>but it's a recent thing because,</v>

915
00:26:10.401 --> 00:26:10.970
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

916
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:14.480
<v Speaker 6>a lot of people think that it apparently that it was like cigarettes or alcohol.</v>

917
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:16.700
<v Speaker 6>He sat HPV and his throat.</v>

918
00:26:16.701 --> 00:26:17.240
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

919
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.080
<v Speaker 6>Brian don't do that.</v>

920
00:26:18.081 --> 00:26:18.914
<v Speaker 6>That's just rude.</v>

921
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:19.970
<v Speaker 6>What was that?</v>

922
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:21.350
<v Speaker 6>Put a Photoshop of them.</v>

923
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:23.870
<v Speaker 6>Let's face off photo shopped Michael Douglas.</v>

924
00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:25.700
<v Speaker 6>Plus he works on his face.</v>

925
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:26.421
<v Speaker 6>That's just rude.</v>

926
00:26:26.421 --> 00:26:27.200
<v Speaker 6>That's is that already is,</v>

927
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.310
<v Speaker 6>but yes,</v>

928
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.733
<v Speaker 6>that's the chief claim.</v>

929
00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.131
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

930
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:31.964
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

931
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:32.451
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>

932
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:32.691
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

933
00:26:32.691 --> 00:26:35.270
<v Speaker 6>it's kind of fucked up that sex can give you diseases.</v>

934
00:26:35.271 --> 00:26:36.500
<v Speaker 6>Like what a stupid,</v>

935
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.860
<v Speaker 6>shitty little fucking trick by nature that sex eating pussy can give you some</v>

936
00:26:42.441 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 6>horrible throat cancer.</v>

937
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.220
<v Speaker 6>Well rude and what sex is most chicks isn't like HPV.</v>

938
00:26:47.221 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 6>Something like most girls have or most guys have huge percent of the population</v>

939
00:26:51.931 --> 00:26:52.200
<v Speaker 6>has it.</v>

940
00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 6>Apparently they can just recently they can,</v>

941
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

942
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.710
<v Speaker 6>they can give you a vaccination fraud,</v>

943
00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 6>but the vaccinations apparently are a little scary,</v>

944
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:01.921
<v Speaker 6>aren't they?</v>

945
00:27:01.921 --> 00:27:02.850
<v Speaker 6>Just there for the girls,</v>

946
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:03.031
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

947
00:27:03.031 --> 00:27:06.960
<v Speaker 6>Young girls get stacks and there was somewhere where it's a controversial with</v>

948
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:10.020
<v Speaker 6>her trying to make the girls like somebody was trying to make girls get them</v>

949
00:27:10.021 --> 00:27:11.400
<v Speaker 6>like or make it mandatory.</v>

950
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 6>Ooh,</v>

951
00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:12.391
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

952
00:27:12.391 --> 00:27:12.991
<v Speaker 6>that's crazy.</v>

953
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:17.340
<v Speaker 6>And then they give you a inoculations vaccinations for kids.</v>

954
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:17.431
<v Speaker 6>They,</v>

955
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:19.170
<v Speaker 6>one of them to give you is a hepatitis B,</v>

956
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.220
<v Speaker 6>which is a,</v>

957
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.790
<v Speaker 6>I think mostly that's actually transmittable I think.</v>

958
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 6>And you've given it to like kids,</v>

959
00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:25.291
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

960
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:28.320
<v Speaker 6>it's like how many people get hepatitis B and now it's like,</v>

961
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:30.060
<v Speaker 6>a lot of them are just from sex.</v>

962
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:30.301
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

963
00:27:30.301 --> 00:27:32.730
<v Speaker 6>like maybe it's something that the kid needs to worry about eventually,</v>

964
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:33.570
<v Speaker 6>but when it,</v>

965
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.500
<v Speaker 6>but when it's a baby,</v>

966
00:27:34.501 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 6>are we sure that hepatitis,</v>

967
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.710
<v Speaker 6>I just remember being told when I was young,</v>

968
00:27:37.711 --> 00:27:39.600
<v Speaker 6>sex without love was unhealthy.</v>

969
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:40.111
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

970
00:27:40.111 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 6>Who told you that crazy ass hole doesn't want to have fun?</v>

971
00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:44.510
<v Speaker 6>I can't remember.</v>

972
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.970
<v Speaker 6>Crazy.</v>

973
00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:46.800
<v Speaker 6>Fuck my mother.</v>

974
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.330
<v Speaker 6>Oh silly mom.</v>

975
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.770
<v Speaker 6>It can be both.</v>

976
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.911
<v Speaker 6>It can be both.</v>

977
00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 6>Sex with love is best know sex without love is pretty fucking good sex.</v>

978
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:56.940
<v Speaker 6>It's nothing wrong with it.</v>

979
00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:57.440
<v Speaker 6>People,</v>

980
00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.090
<v Speaker 6>if not it needs to be the same.</v>

981
00:27:59.091 --> 00:28:00.690
<v Speaker 6>But the connection,</v>

982
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:01.770
<v Speaker 6>there's a connection there.</v>

983
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

984
00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:02.990
<v Speaker 6>If you know,</v>

985
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.660
<v Speaker 6>if you love somebody,</v>

986
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.030
<v Speaker 6>probably care enough and more about them to find out whether or not,</v>

987
00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.420
<v Speaker 6>but,</v>

988
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:13.830
<v Speaker 6>but at certain numbers it's like the sex without the love is more than a rushed</v>

989
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:14.560
<v Speaker 6>state.</v>

990
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:14.900
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

991
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.631

<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

994
00:28:16.351 --> 00:28:16.980
<v Speaker 6>I don't care.</v>

995
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.030
<v Speaker 6>They don't speak English.</v>

996
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:20.140
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember when everybody was worried about AIDS?</v>

997
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:22.651
<v Speaker 6>I do.</v>

1011
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:39.564
<v Speaker 6>You were still</v>

1016
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.850
<v Speaker 6>I remember I was in my car and I was driving to the gym and I was listening to</v>

1017
00:28:50.851 --> 00:28:54.930
<v Speaker 6>the radio and Nace I've remembered the fucking the street I was turning on when</v>

1018
00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:59.650
<v Speaker 6>they said Magic Johnson just announced that he's HIV positive was home.</v>

1019
00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:02.520
<v Speaker 6>I was thinking this shit was the Zombie apocalypse.</v>

1020
00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.270
<v Speaker 6>I was like him going on the radio and saying he's HIV positive.</v>

1021
00:29:06.271 --> 00:29:07.104
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

1022
00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.430
<v Speaker 6>Magic Johnson,</v>

1023
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:10.480
<v Speaker 6>one of the greatest basketball players of all time.</v>

1024
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.380
<v Speaker 6>We're all going to die.</v>

1025
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:13.411
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

1026
00:29:13.411 --> 00:29:13.951
<v Speaker 6>he's got hates.</v>

1027
00:29:13.951 --> 00:29:14.731
<v Speaker 6>Holy Shit.</v>

1028
00:29:14.731 --> 00:29:15.541
<v Speaker 6>It's common man.</v>

1029
00:29:15.541 --> 00:29:15.750
<v Speaker 6>I would,</v>

1030
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:18.150
<v Speaker 6>I just anticipated a wave of AIDS.</v>

1031
00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:19.710
<v Speaker 6>He said never arrived.</v>

1032
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.360
<v Speaker 6>Change.</v>

1033
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:22.351
<v Speaker 6>Strange.</v>

1034
00:29:22.351 --> 00:29:22.741
<v Speaker 6>Strange,</v>

1035
00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:23.430
<v Speaker 6>strange.</v>

1036
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.370
<v Speaker 6>I remember when he died of aids and I was like,</v>

1037
00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:26.700
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

1038
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.361
<v Speaker 6>cause that one,</v>

1039
00:29:27.361 --> 00:29:29.460
<v Speaker 6>nobody even knew about it until he was dead.</v>

1040
00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:30.383
<v Speaker 6>It's crazy.</v>

1041
00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1042
00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.750
<v Speaker 6>And these people that are dying of AIDS in Africa.</v>

1043
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.450
<v Speaker 6>That's a really fascinating thing as well because,</v>

1044
00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:36.840
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1045
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.110
<v Speaker 6>apparently someone please tweet me,</v>

1046
00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.500
<v Speaker 6>and correct me if this is incorrect,</v>

1047
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

1048
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:45.940
<v Speaker 1>what I've was told was that a lot of what they see when they release figures,</v>

1049
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:46.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1050
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:46.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1051
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:48.040
<v Speaker 1>x amount of people have aids,</v>

1052
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.920
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean x amount of people or even HIV positive.</v>

1053
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:53.050
<v Speaker 1>That means that they have the symptoms of aids.</v>

1054
00:29:53.051 --> 00:29:54.640
<v Speaker 1>It means their immune system is fucked.</v>

1055
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 1>So they see these people in,</v>

1056
00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:58.540
<v Speaker 1>whether it's from poor nutrition or a host of various diseases,</v>

1057
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 1>they don't necessarily test every one of these people because it's expensive to</v>

1058
00:30:03.221 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>

1059
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.270
<v Speaker 1>So apparently when you hear x amount of people have aids,</v>

1060
00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:09.310
<v Speaker 1>that's a little on the rough side.</v>

1061
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit of a rough estimate.</v>

1062
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:11.081
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1063
00:30:11.081 --> 00:30:11.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1064
00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.090
<v Speaker 1>it's just people are fucked.</v>

1065
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a shit spot to be,</v>

1066
00:30:14.711 --> 00:30:16.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot wrong with being there.</v>

1067
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:17.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of fucking diseases.</v>

1068
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a,</v>

1069
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:19.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1070
00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:20.980
<v Speaker 1>HIV like,</v>

1071
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn Africa's got a host of fucking diseases,</v>

1072
00:30:23.041 --> 00:30:25.360
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're poor and you're not eating anything.</v>

1073
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:29.620
<v Speaker 1>And then like I remember seeing something on a show once about like there was</v>

1074
00:30:29.621 --> 00:30:34.570
<v Speaker 1>some certain tribe or area of Africa where the believe the cure for aids,</v>

1075
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 1>what's to fucking version,</v>

1076
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:39.100
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>

1077
00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.900
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1078
00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:40.733
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1079
00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 1>how do you even come up with that?</v>

1080
00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Africa is still rock,</v>

1081
00:30:44.861 --> 00:30:47.050
<v Speaker 1>some really crazy ways of life.</v>

1082
00:30:47.051 --> 00:30:50.620
<v Speaker 1>It gives you insight into the way the world was just a thousand years ago or</v>

1083
00:30:50.621 --> 00:30:51.580
<v Speaker 1>2000 years ago.</v>

1084
00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Like witchcraft is huge in Africa,</v>

1085
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:58.540
<v Speaker 1>which craft and burning people because they're witches and accusing people of</v>

1086
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:03.541
<v Speaker 1>witches and people doing things to help cure you of demonic possession.</v>

1087
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.350
<v Speaker 1>There's like a big business in it where they like cure children of demonic</v>

1088
00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:09.540
<v Speaker 1>possession and they,</v>

1089
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:10.120
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1090
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.510
<v Speaker 1>they take them from their parents and their required,</v>

1091
00:31:12.511 --> 00:31:15.730
<v Speaker 1>their parents come up with thousands and thousands of dollars to give to them.</v>

1092
00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So the parents go fucking crazy and do anything they can to get the money to get</v>

1093
00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:22.270
<v Speaker 1>their children back because this guy's claiming that this child is possessed by</v>

1094
00:31:22.271 --> 00:31:23.104
<v Speaker 1>the devil.</v>

1095
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.120
<v Speaker 1>So if he doesn't do this exorcism,</v>

1096
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.250
<v Speaker 1>like they'll kill this kid like this.</v>

1097
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.310
<v Speaker 1>It's a a normal common thing in Africa.</v>

1098
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I remember seeing something about that fucking crazy.</v>

1099
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1100
00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.600
<v Speaker 1>and there's a ton of them and they're all running this racket scare the fuck out</v>

1101
00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:39.550
<v Speaker 1>of everybody killing people and it's,</v>

1102
00:31:39.551 --> 00:31:40.030
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

1103
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.800
<v Speaker 1>it's a naughty place to live</v>

1104
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.550
<v Speaker 1>and it's 2013 man.</v>

1105
00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:46.031
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

1106
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:46.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1107
00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.130
<v Speaker 1>we're sitting here chilling in the valley,</v>

1108
00:31:48.131 --> 00:31:50.560
<v Speaker 1>having ourselves a good old time drinking coffee,</v>

1109
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.341
<v Speaker 1>kicking back,</v>

1110
00:31:51.341 --> 00:31:52.174
<v Speaker 1>playing music.</v>

1111
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.510
<v Speaker 1>This is dude out there is like burning people because he says there are a,</v>

1112
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.790
<v Speaker 1>which you know that's all going on somewhere.</v>

1113
00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:58.653
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1114
00:31:58.670 --> 00:31:59.503
<v Speaker 1>it's nutty.</v>

1115
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.660
<v Speaker 1>It's Nutty as fuck or moving there.</v>

1116
00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:02.523
<v Speaker 1>Don't go to African</v>

1117
00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:04.803
<v Speaker 1>people tried.</v>

1118
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.170
<v Speaker 1>There was a bunch of Europeans are going to start a wildlife preserve.</v>

1119
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.500
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to preserve itself just fine.</v>

1120
00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you really need to preserve it,</v>

1121
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 1>you need to stop people from killing them.</v>

1122
00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:17.620
<v Speaker 1>People where people are always killing him for like hard on pills,</v>

1123
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:18.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1124
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.120
<v Speaker 1>it's always Chinese people that think that you can get some Rhino Horn grinds it</v>

1125
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 1>up and you dick grows some tiger penis.</v>

1126
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.650
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1127
00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

1128
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.923
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

1129
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:27.550
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

1130
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:31.420
<v Speaker 1>There's some other benefits for Rhino Horn or other uses that they use,</v>

1131
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's what they're killing these rhinos for it.</v>

1132
00:32:32.951 --> 00:32:36.190
<v Speaker 1>They're like wiping out the white vinyl population and because people in Asia</v>

1133
00:32:36.191 --> 00:32:37.660
<v Speaker 1>have this thing for rhino horns,</v>

1134
00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:39.460
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>

1135
00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.270
<v Speaker 1>it would kind of suck if there was no more rhinos.</v>

1136
00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Rhinos are kind of bad ass.</v>

1137
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.040
<v Speaker 1>The fact that that thing actually,</v>

1138
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 1>there's gotta be thin at this point though.</v>

1139
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:46.941
<v Speaker 1>It must be very thin.</v>

1140
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:50.330
<v Speaker 1>I think some of them are actually extinct now because these dudes just won't</v>

1141
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 1>stop hunting them.</v>

1142
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:51.711
<v Speaker 1>They don't give a fuck.</v>

1143
00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:52.544
<v Speaker 1>It's just this is,</v>

1144
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 1>they live wild.</v>

1145
00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a wild place.</v>

1146
00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:57.161
<v Speaker 1>We're so,</v>

1147
00:32:57.161 --> 00:32:58.430
<v Speaker 1>so off on that same thing.</v>

1148
00:32:58.431 --> 00:32:59.650

1199
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.141
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1200
00:34:21.141 --> 00:34:22.100
<v Speaker 1>when I lived in Florida,</v>

1201
00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:23.780
<v Speaker 1>dog got stolen from some old lady.</v>

1202
00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:26.010
<v Speaker 1>That alligator just</v>

1203
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Speaker 1>go rack doggy every right to that.</v>

1204
00:34:30.651 --> 00:34:31.484
<v Speaker 1>His mind,</v>

1205
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.810
<v Speaker 1>their gallery that's not stolen as the rules of the word dog was slipping.</v>

1206
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.690
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it Doug slip and it was tied to a chain.</v>

1207
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:41.720
<v Speaker 1>There was an old lady who can't run other end and that's just dinner.</v>

1208
00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1209
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.310
<v Speaker 1>The Florida one of the alligator recognizes the old lady couldn't run.</v>

1210
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.530
<v Speaker 1>I wonder because it just came out of the water.</v>

1211
00:34:48.531 --> 00:34:48.800
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1212
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

1213
00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that Mac.</v>

1214
00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Cause she's lucky it took the dog.</v>

1215
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.641
<v Speaker 1>She's very lucky,</v>

1216
00:34:55.641 --> 00:34:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but they're weird.</v>

1217
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.771
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>

1218
00:34:56.771 --> 00:34:58.340
<v Speaker 1>they'd very rarely attack people.</v>

1219
00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Although there was a story recently where a guy was running from the cops.</v>

1220
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.820
<v Speaker 1>It was on a,</v>

1221
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.960
<v Speaker 1>in Miami and he,</v>

1222
00:35:02.961 --> 00:35:03.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1223
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.100
<v Speaker 1>hit the brakes and jumped off an overpass into the water right where an</v>

1224
00:35:07.101 --> 00:35:07.881
<v Speaker 1>alligator was.</v>

1225
00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:10.100
<v Speaker 1>So literally as he jumped into the water,</v>

1226
00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:13.790
<v Speaker 1>the alligator attacked him and killed him right in front of the cops.</v>

1227
00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Probably got jumps off a fucking bridge and lands on you.</v>

1228
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.640
<v Speaker 1>The alligator just fucked him up.</v>

1229
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.350
<v Speaker 1>The cop said it was like a scene in the movie.</v>

1230
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:24.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like the guy literally locks up his brakes,</v>

1231
00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.400
<v Speaker 1>jumps into the water,</v>

1232
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:25.790
<v Speaker 1>and then it's,</v>

1233
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:26.800
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1234
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:28.670
<v Speaker 1>alligators are just ripping them apart.</v>

1235
00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.691
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

1236
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:33.710
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty rare that they get people crazy crocodiles with what we've got to</v>

1237
00:35:33.711 --> 00:35:34.544
<v Speaker 1>worry about.</v>

1238
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.460
<v Speaker 1>They have a,</v>

1239
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.800
<v Speaker 1>they found Nile crocodiles and the everglades now.</v>

1240
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:38.820

1244
00:35:40.251 --> 00:35:43.200
<v Speaker 1>they issue to kill on order for these Nile crocodiles.</v>

1245
00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:43.981
<v Speaker 1>As far as they know,</v>

1246
00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:45.480
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a breeding population,</v>

1247
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.700
<v Speaker 1>but there definitely have been spotted in the everglades,</v>

1248
00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:50.750

<v Speaker 1>That's like the Mexico of the deep south.</v>

1263
00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.570
<v Speaker 1>That's what Florida's like cause it's like you go below the deep,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:49.410
<v Speaker 1>This is a strong mills.</v>

1325
00:37:49.411 --> 00:37:52.760
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't take a pill and just go in where he had to get that shit up for</v>

1326
00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:53.410
<v Speaker 1>grizzled.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1328
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.470
<v Speaker 1>That is a strong move.</v>

1329
00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Are we sure that it was before there was Viagara when was fired?</v>

1330
00:37:58.410 --> 00:37:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I was like in the eighties man.</v>

1331
00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.241
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

1332
00:38:00.241 --> 00:38:02.400
<v Speaker 1>it was it the eighties hmm.</v>

1333
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure this was in the eighties early nineties at demos.</v>

1334
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.630
<v Speaker 1>When did they invent Viagara?</v>

1335
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Brian Know Brian at his home.</v>

1336
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:18.270
<v Speaker 1>The weather was [inaudible] 78 degrees.</v>

1337
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Those core,</v>

1338
00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:20.880
<v Speaker 1>those commercials are always so lame.</v>

1339
00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:24.120
<v Speaker 1>It's always like a couple with gray hair and they're holding hands and they look</v>

1340
00:38:24.121 --> 00:38:26.880
<v Speaker 1>at each other and they come close and you know the cuddle,</v>

1341
00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:27.810
<v Speaker 1>you know it's,</v>

1342
00:38:27.810 --> 00:38:32.220
<v Speaker 1>it's never a dude with a maniacal look on his face and a boner that's five hours</v>

1343
00:38:32.221 --> 00:38:35.440
<v Speaker 1>old will not die and he's sweating and his heart,</v>

1344
00:38:35.441 --> 00:38:36.650
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking Liba Navis</v>

1345
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:37.503
<v Speaker 2>chest.</v>

1346
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 2>It's never that.</v>

1347
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm always curious about the one that says it lasts for three days and you can</v>

1348
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:44.650
<v Speaker 2>just like kind of call upon it when you want.</v>

1349
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Jeannie,</v>

1350
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.300
<v Speaker 2>you keep for three days.</v>

1351
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm on that shit right now and it sucks it really the three day things not that</v>

1352
00:38:54.911 --> 00:38:55.744
<v Speaker 2>good like it.</v>

1353
00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.030
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1354
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:59.440
<v Speaker 2>Explain to me how that works,</v>

1355
00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.060
<v Speaker 2>what you can just summon a boner while you were on it.</v>

1356
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:04.990
<v Speaker 2>I noticed like the first day it's like just intense,</v>

1357
00:39:04.991 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 2>like everything that happens close to your Dick,</v>

1358
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:09.550
<v Speaker 2>it just makes a boner immediately.</v>

1359
00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Like today it's more like if I start touching it or if something,</v>

1360
00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:16.240
<v Speaker 2>if Jamie starts like kissing it with is pretty lips,</v>

1361
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.400
<v Speaker 2>then it would definitely like shoot right back up.</v>

1362
00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.800
<v Speaker 2>But it's not as sensitive to the point where I'm like walking around like</v>

1363
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:21.550
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit,</v>

1364
00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:24.880
<v Speaker 2>I have a boner right now where the first day he is third day.</v>

1365
00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.850
<v Speaker 2>It's just kind of like you have to try a little harder.</v>

1366
00:39:27.851 --> 00:39:29.000
<v Speaker 2>But when it's ready,</v>

1367
00:39:29.001 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 2>if you take invite Viagra or Cialis or which,</v>

1368
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:32.991
<v Speaker 2>which one of them was,</v>

1369
00:39:32.991 --> 00:39:34.060
<v Speaker 2>this was black power,</v>

1370
00:39:34.061 --> 00:39:34.740
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

1371
00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:34.840
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1372
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.640
<v Speaker 2>it's probably see the Alice,</v>

1373
00:39:36.641 --> 00:39:39.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bigger pill so it's more Cialis than a normal pill.</v>

1374
00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:41.030
<v Speaker 2>So it's like five days worth of Seattle.</v>

1375
00:39:41.031 --> 00:39:41.864
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1376
00:39:42.010 --> 00:39:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Why are you taking all of that?</v>

1377
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.490
<v Speaker 2>Because I have,</v>

1378
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:46.760
<v Speaker 2>but I don't you</v>

1379
00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:49.540
<v Speaker 2>be a better idea.</v>

1380
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:50.651
<v Speaker 2>Don't think it'd be better.</v>

1381
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I did just take like half a pill.</v>

1382
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever thought about taking half a pill?</v>

1383
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.310
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1384
00:39:56.310 --> 00:40:01.310
<v Speaker 2>Cause I do you think are you going to die?</v>

1385
00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1386
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.360
<v Speaker 2>where are your heart's going to fucking give out?</v>

1387
00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I think boner pills at a certain level or unhealthy.</v>

1388
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1389
00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:11.050
<v Speaker 2>it's weight loss problems other places.</v>

1390
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Most of the time</v>

1391
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.570
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's hard to borrow it temporarily,</v>

1392
00:40:16.571 --> 00:40:19.380
<v Speaker 2>but the interest rates get higher the longer you hold onto it.</v>

1393
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:20.990
<v Speaker 2>Check Danielson's Ferris,</v>

1394
00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:21.780
<v Speaker 2>so he says</v>

1395
00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.890
<v Speaker 1>biological lunch,</v>

1396
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.180
<v Speaker 1>there's no bug free book,</v>

1397
00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:24.961
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>

1398
00:40:24.961 --> 00:40:25.560
<v Speaker 1>free lunch.</v>

1399
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.950
<v Speaker 1>When you take something and it has a very positive reaction and also probably</v>

1400
00:40:28.951 --> 00:40:33.600
<v Speaker 1>has some side effects that you're not really aware of that are equally powerful.</v>

1401
00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:34.493
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1402
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:35.780
<v Speaker 2>ripping pussy apart.</v>

1403
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.230
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] another thing it does,</v>

1404
00:40:39.231 --> 00:40:39.861
<v Speaker 2>it really helps.</v>

1405
00:40:39.861 --> 00:40:41.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not coming at all.</v>

1406
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:45.080
<v Speaker 2>That's like if you sometimes don't even come and you're just like,</v>

1407
00:40:45.081 --> 00:40:45.381
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1408
00:40:45.381 --> 00:40:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I just fucking made that chick have like the best sex and the whole entire</v>

1409
00:40:48.681 --> 00:40:49.010
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

1410
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:52.010
<v Speaker 2>I know many people across the country or a barfing right now I'm just thinking</v>

1411
00:40:52.011 --> 00:40:56.570
<v Speaker 2>of you having sex with anyone and you're talking about Taryn pussy apart and put</v>

1412
00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.580
<v Speaker 2>a quilt quilt done.</v>

1413
00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:00.000
<v Speaker 2>After that they hurt your brain or</v>

1414
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.490
<v Speaker 1>brain already heard which one is,</v>

1415
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.130
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy talk.</v>

1416
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:05.611
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1417
00:41:05.611 --> 00:41:06.444
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>

1418
00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:07.770
<v Speaker 1>You should probably have less.</v>

1419
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I think there's,</v>

1420
00:41:09.601 --> 00:41:13.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain dangerous with it but you know that's one thing that is weird.</v>

1421
00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Apparently it didn't enhance his athletic performance.</v>

1422
00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.750
<v Speaker 1>It's banned in the Olympics</v>

1423
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.700
<v Speaker 2>cause it's three cycles.</v>

1424
00:41:19.701 --> 00:41:20.001
<v Speaker 2>Your,</v>

1425
00:41:20.001 --> 00:41:21.890
<v Speaker 2>your blood positive</v>

1426
00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:25.731
<v Speaker 2>doctor Brian,</v>

1427
00:41:25.731 --> 00:41:30.380
<v Speaker 2>how would you a scientifically described the effects of it moves the blood she's</v>

1428
00:41:30.381 --> 00:41:31.880
<v Speaker 2>down around or your place.</v>

1429
00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:36.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1430
00:41:36.721 --> 00:41:39.030
<v Speaker 3>but apparently enhances endurance.</v>

1431
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:42.330
<v Speaker 3>I like how the pill was called the black power black power.</v>

1432
00:41:42.331 --> 00:41:42.661
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

1433
00:41:42.661 --> 00:41:43.381
<v Speaker 3>it's a white guy.</v>

1434
00:41:43.381 --> 00:41:44.960
<v Speaker 3>Fucking a black chick on the cover.</v>

1435
00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:47.493
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>

1436
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.820
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>But I remember,</v>

1450
00:42:07.081 --> 00:42:08.190
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I got out of hospital,</v>

1451
00:42:08.191 --> 00:42:12.180
<v Speaker 3>a really important thing to me was the doctor said you can't have sex so you</v>

1452
00:42:12.181 --> 00:42:13.530
<v Speaker 3>could walk a flight of stairs.</v>

1453
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:14.430
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1454
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:17.490
<v Speaker 3>And I would look at the stairs like every day and be like,</v>

1455
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.333
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna try it.</v>

1456
00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:19.411
<v Speaker 3>Three steps.</v>

1457
00:42:19.411 --> 00:42:20.490
<v Speaker 3>And I'd come back down to,</v>

1458
00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.530
<v Speaker 3>we bought a week and a half.</v>

1459
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:24.110
<v Speaker 3>Now when they date,</v>

1460
00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:28.200
<v Speaker 3>they give you open heart surgery or they have them open up your chest bone?</v>

1461
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.063
<v Speaker 3>Yes sir.</v>

1462
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.451
<v Speaker 3>What does that like,</v>

1463
00:42:30.451 --> 00:42:31.980
<v Speaker 3>how long does it take before that heals up?</v>

1464
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1465
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.081
<v Speaker 3>do you feel it now,</v>

1466
00:42:34.081 --> 00:42:34.861
<v Speaker 3>like when you touch it,</v>

1467
00:42:34.861 --> 00:42:35.650
<v Speaker 3>does it bother you?</v>

1468
00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.310
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I feel the wire through the skin.</v>

1469
00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:38.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1470
00:42:38.491 --> 00:42:39.970
<v Speaker 3>Cause they wire it shut.</v>

1471
00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:40.441
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1472
00:42:40.441 --> 00:42:42.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a little wire in and when I get x ray you see like,</v>

1473
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:45.600
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a little Barb wire thing wrapped around the sternum.</v>

1474
00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.880
<v Speaker 3>Does that go off when you go through the metal detectors?</v>

1475
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:48.691
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1476
00:42:48.691 --> 00:42:49.050
<v Speaker 3>they'd have,</v>

1477
00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:51.820
<v Speaker 3>they have to have it once or twice in my life since this happened.</v>

1478
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.651
<v Speaker 3>I believed that,</v>

1479
00:42:52.651 --> 00:42:54.150
<v Speaker 3>that it's that set it off.</v>

1480
00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:56.220
<v Speaker 3>But it's like when they're on super high,</v>

1481
00:42:56.221 --> 00:42:57.530
<v Speaker 3>like if they're set high,</v>

1482
00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:58.680
<v Speaker 3>I think I've got,</v>

1483
00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:59.700
<v Speaker 3>I've gone through those,</v>

1484
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.750
<v Speaker 3>you know the full body,</v>

1485
00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:01.890
<v Speaker 3>they never say a word.</v>

1486
00:43:01.891 --> 00:43:03.180
<v Speaker 3>They never asked me about anything.</v>

1487
00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know if they see the full body is a radio wave thing and what it's</v>

1488
00:43:07.561 --> 00:43:09.510
<v Speaker 3>looking for is external objects.</v>

1489
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.250
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1490
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Looking for shit that you might have in your pocket and like shanks,</v>

1491
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:15.520
<v Speaker 3>you know sometimes like those lines,</v>

1492
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:17.760
<v Speaker 3>those make it go off if it,</v>

1493
00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.250
<v Speaker 3>if it's set re you know,</v>

1494
00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.460
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously high.</v>

1495
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:21.443
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1496
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:22.980
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had guys go like what is that?</v>

1497
00:43:22.981 --> 00:43:23.521
<v Speaker 3>And I'd be like,</v>

1498
00:43:23.521 --> 00:43:23.851
<v Speaker 3>I won.</v>

1499
00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:24.750
<v Speaker 3>I didn't wear a necklace to the,</v>

1500
00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:27.360
<v Speaker 3>I was like you must be getting either the wire or my valve.</v>

1501
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:28.561
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1502
00:43:28.561 --> 00:43:29.640
<v Speaker 3>Right through the skin.</v>

1503
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:30.780
<v Speaker 3>How fucked up is that?</v>

1504
00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:32.100
<v Speaker 3>We have to test people from metal,</v>

1505
00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:34.410
<v Speaker 3>make sure they're not bring anything hard on them.</v>

1506
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:35.760
<v Speaker 3>Does it feel foreign?</v>

1507
00:43:35.761 --> 00:43:38.340
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes there's like vibrate during certain things.</v>

1508
00:43:38.341 --> 00:43:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're like on a roller coaster,</v>

1509
00:43:39.781 --> 00:43:42.750
<v Speaker 3>do you feel like I just certain foreign object inside of you?</v>

1510
00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.170
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1511
00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:43.440
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1512
00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:43.651
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1513
00:43:43.651 --> 00:43:44.230
<v Speaker 3>It's all the,</v>

1514
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:45.063
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1515
00:43:45.330 --> 00:43:47.610
<v Speaker 3>the crazy part is like acoustics of rooms.</v>

1516
00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.650
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes if I'm sitting in the right spot,</v>

1517
00:43:49.651 --> 00:43:50.580
<v Speaker 3>it's so loud.</v>

1518
00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.920
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous because it's like tick,</v>

1519
00:43:51.921 --> 00:43:52.101
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>

1520
00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:52.271
<v Speaker 3>tick,</v>

1521
00:43:52.271 --> 00:43:52.491
<v Speaker 3>tick.</v>

1522
00:43:52.491 --> 00:43:52.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1523
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:53.443
<v Speaker 3>Like people,</v>

1524
00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:54.031
<v Speaker 3>I'll be like,</v>

1525
00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:54.480
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>

1526
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:54.631
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1527
00:43:54.631 --> 00:43:56.310
<v Speaker 3>if I'm in the right spot in the right room,</v>

1528
00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.793
<v Speaker 3>that is why,</v>

1529
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.030
<v Speaker 3>because 90% of the time for me,</v>

1530
00:44:00.031 --> 00:44:00.930
<v Speaker 3>it's white noise.</v>

1531
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:01.411
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1532
00:44:01.411 --> 00:44:02.180
<v Speaker 3>I to just kind of,</v>

1533
00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.960
<v Speaker 3>I don't hear that anymore.</v>

1534
00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.281
<v Speaker 3>I want to,</v>

1535
00:44:05.281 --> 00:44:06.810
<v Speaker 3>I can hear it click his life.</v>

1536
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:07.853
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1537
00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.380
<v Speaker 3>Oddly enough is it,</v>

1538
00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:09.671
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1539
00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:09.930
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1540
00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:10.620
<v Speaker 3>it's a clock.</v>

1541
00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.340
<v Speaker 3>To me it's like,</v>

1542
00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:11.671
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1543
00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:12.220
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1544
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:15.000
<v Speaker 3>that's each one of those is the second I was thinking about it the other day,</v>

1545
00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:17.130
<v Speaker 3>I was just talking to somebody about like,</v>

1546
00:44:17.131 --> 00:44:17.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1547
00:44:17.341 --> 00:44:18.360
<v Speaker 3>when you really figured out what,</v>

1548
00:44:18.361 --> 00:44:19.470
<v Speaker 3>how many days we live?</v>

1549
00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:22.920
<v Speaker 3>Maybe thirty five thousand forty thousand days.</v>

1550
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.881
<v Speaker 3>Is that a lot?</v>

1551
00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:25.320
<v Speaker 3>365 days a year.</v>

1552
00:44:25.350 --> 00:44:29.490
<v Speaker 3>So ten seven hundred 3000 so you know,</v>

1553
00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:34.550
<v Speaker 3>23,000 if you live 60 years,</v>

1554
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:36.031
<v Speaker 3>70 years,</v>

1555
00:44:36.031 --> 00:44:41.031
<v Speaker 3>call it 70 70 times 365</v>

1556
00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:45.030
<v Speaker 3>sounds like we were all math retards.</v>

1557
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:48.060
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of time and somewhere in that neighborhood.</v>

1558
00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:48.240
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1559
00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a lot of days 40 let's call it 50,000 days.</v>

1560
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:52.590
<v Speaker 3>Your life is right.</v>

1561
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 3>Does that sound like a lot doesn't to me?</v>

1562
00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:55.310
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1563
00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:55.560
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1564
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.393
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't sound,</v>

1565
00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:58.350
<v Speaker 3>I equate it to dollars,</v>

1566
00:44:58.351 --> 00:44:58.591
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1567
00:44:58.591 --> 00:44:59.670
<v Speaker 3>I could spend that now.</v>

1568
00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 3>I go to here right now I spent $50,000.</v>

1569
00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1570

<v Speaker 3>I hear you.</v>

1572
00:45:03.961 --> 00:45:04.531

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:14.130
<v Speaker 3>I think we like to think that the shit is going to last forever,</v>

1580
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:15.120
<v Speaker 3>but clearly it's not.</v>

1581
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1582
00:45:15.630 --> 00:45:16.441
<v Speaker 3>it's really short,</v>

1583
00:45:16.441 --> 00:45:16.650
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1584
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.110
<v Speaker 3>That's the one thing that whole thing really made me realize when I was laying</v>

1585
00:45:19.111 --> 00:45:20.640
<v Speaker 3>on the thing going in thinking I was,</v>

1586
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:22.140
<v Speaker 3>I was literacy mainly thinking I was,</v>

1587
00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:23.250
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't coming out of it.</v>

1588
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:23.671
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1589
00:45:23.671 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm dying.</v>

1590
00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:26.580
<v Speaker 3>Do you know the whole,</v>

1591
00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:27.571
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

1592
00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:29.430
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see visions of flashing before my eyes.</v>

1593
00:45:29.431 --> 00:45:30.264
<v Speaker 3>It was just the whole,</v>

1594
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.890
<v Speaker 3>I think I might even said it on the show before.</v>

1595
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:33.150
<v Speaker 3>It was the summation of like,</v>

1596
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:35.070
<v Speaker 3>that's how long it was.</v>

1597
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1598
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 3>That was a blink of a fucking I from birth till now.</v>

1599
00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:39.060
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1600
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:39.540
<v Speaker 3>Which is,</v>

1601
00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:40.373
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

1602
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.300
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

1603
00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.133
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1604
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.310
<v Speaker 3>and that's really my biggest lesson out of it.</v>

1605
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.350
<v Speaker 3>And now I've got a clock ticking.</v>

1606
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm the,</v>

1607
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:47.491
<v Speaker 3>I'm the,</v>

1608
00:45:47.491 --> 00:45:48.930
<v Speaker 3>I'm the crocodile from Peter Pan,</v>

1609
00:45:48.931 --> 00:45:49.590
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1610
00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:49.771
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1611
00:45:49.771 --> 00:45:52.500
<v Speaker 3>when you go through anything that really makes you think that it could be over</v>

1612
00:45:52.501 --> 00:45:52.631
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1613
00:45:52.631 --> 00:45:54.240
<v Speaker 3>makes you reassess the whole picture.</v>

1614
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes we just get real used to everything used to be and you know,</v>

1615
00:45:58.951 --> 00:46:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I build to go to the supermarket and get food.</v>

1616
00:46:00.811 --> 00:46:04.080
<v Speaker 3>You get used to being able to get up in the morning and walk,</v>

1617
00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:04.561
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1618
00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.240
<v Speaker 3>you get used to all being alive.</v>

1619
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.970
<v Speaker 3>Being alive.</v>

1620
00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:07.803
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1621
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.430
<v Speaker 3>Just the,</v>

1622
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:09.630
<v Speaker 3>just being conscious.</v>

1623
00:46:09.631 --> 00:46:09.811
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1624
00:46:09.811 --> 00:46:11.010
<v Speaker 3>the world is a strange,</v>

1625
00:46:11.011 --> 00:46:12.420
<v Speaker 3>strange fuck place manner,</v>

1626
00:46:12.421 --> 00:46:13.530
<v Speaker 3>which is so used to it.</v>

1627
00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.540
<v Speaker 3>We don't even think about a stranger does.</v>

1628
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Every once in a while I'll sit back and just think about the actual breath I'm</v>

1629
00:46:20.431 --> 00:46:21.264
<v Speaker 3>going to take.</v>

1630
00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.850
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1631
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:24.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1632
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:25.160
<v Speaker 3>What that,</v>

1633
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 3>what we just and what you took in,</v>

1634
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:27.930
<v Speaker 3>what your body took out of it,</v>

1635
00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:28.770
<v Speaker 3>what you're pushing out.</v>

1636
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:29.623
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1637
00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.730
<v Speaker 3>That one simple thing is,</v>

1638
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:32.210
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

1639
00:46:32.210 --> 00:46:35.490
<v Speaker 3>is high science and it's invisible completely.</v>

1640
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:36.900
<v Speaker 3>You need it and it's invisible.</v>

1641
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:37.800
<v Speaker 3>You don't even know where it is.</v>

1642
00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:38.800
<v Speaker 3>It'd be in a room,</v>

1643
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:39.640
<v Speaker 3>there's none of it in there.</v>

1644
00:46:39.641 --> 00:46:40.950
<v Speaker 3>And they walk in there and God.</v>

1645
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:42.293
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

1646
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:43.561
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

1647
00:46:43.561 --> 00:46:44.820
<v Speaker 3>what led you to,</v>

1648
00:46:44.880 --> 00:46:45.480
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

1649
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.260
<v Speaker 3>to the Muslim religion as opposed to like Christian with a family that,</v>

1650
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:49.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1651
00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:50.071
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1652
00:46:50.071 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 3>was Muslim.</v>

1653
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.070
<v Speaker 3>They never once talked to me about or anything.</v>

1654
00:46:53.071 --> 00:46:58.071
<v Speaker 3>I found some literature that I've read and listened to a tape or two and at the</v>

1655
00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:02.640
<v Speaker 3>F my fundamental understanding of it is it's actually all,</v>

1656
00:47:02.641 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 3>it's all three of the Judeo Christianity,</v>

1657
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:07.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1658
00:47:07.111 --> 00:47:07.711
<v Speaker 3>it's that whole,</v>

1659
00:47:07.711 --> 00:47:10.770
<v Speaker 3>it's a summation of all three is it?</v>

1660
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:11.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1661
00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.241
<v Speaker 3>What are the,</v>

1662
00:47:12.241 --> 00:47:13.440
<v Speaker 3>what are the three,</v>

1663
00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:15.091
<v Speaker 3>Judaism,</v>

1664
00:47:15.091 --> 00:47:16.650
<v Speaker 3>Christianity and Islam.</v>

1665
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:20.370
<v Speaker 3>It goes through all those so called profits and all that.</v>

1666
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 3>And to be honest,</v>

1667
00:47:21.721 --> 00:47:22.381
<v Speaker 3>it's like all those,</v>

1668
00:47:22.381 --> 00:47:22.591
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1669
00:47:22.591 --> 00:47:23.970
<v Speaker 3>the more the older I get,</v>

1670
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.320
<v Speaker 3>the more I see.</v>

1671
00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 3>Those are stories I still,</v>

1672
00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:27.920
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1673
00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 3>believe in the creator.</v>

1674
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:29.800
<v Speaker 3>I believe,</v>

1675
00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.300
<v Speaker 3>see Islam for me just brought me like,</v>

1676
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:31.451
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1677
00:47:31.451 --> 00:47:32.440
<v Speaker 3>this is all connected.</v>

1678
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:36.910
<v Speaker 3>And it was like very much about peace in a time in my life when I needed that.</v>

1679
00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.523
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1680
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:39.663
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1681
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:40.811
<v Speaker 3>but like I said,</v>

1682
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:41.081
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

1683
00:47:41.081 --> 00:47:42.910
<v Speaker 3>I have not part of any mosque.</v>

1684
00:47:42.911 --> 00:47:44.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm not part of any and I haven't even,</v>

1685
00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 3>I don't even practice like that.</v>

1686
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:46.421
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1687
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:46.641
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1688
00:47:46.641 --> 00:47:46.900
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1689
00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:47.201
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>

1690
00:47:47.201 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 3>it's like personal.</v>

1691
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:49.743
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1692
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:51.550
<v Speaker 3>if it wasn't me and you having this discussion,</v>

1693
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:51.851
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1694
00:47:51.851 --> 00:47:52.031
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1695
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:52.330
<v Speaker 3>it's not,</v>

1696
00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:53.350
<v Speaker 3>it's not even important,</v>

1697
00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:53.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1698
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:54.573
<v Speaker 3>It's my thing.</v>

1699
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:55.271
<v Speaker 3>Whatever,</v>

1700
00:47:55.271 --> 00:47:56.140
<v Speaker 3>yours is yours.</v>

1701
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1702
00:47:56.850 --> 00:47:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Cause if I was a real Muslim,</v>

1703
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:00.000
<v Speaker 3>like hardcore,</v>

1704
00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:01.460
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>

1705
00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:02.530
<v Speaker 3>it's praise Odin,</v>

1706
00:48:02.531 --> 00:48:03.350
<v Speaker 3>I'd be all offense.</v>

1707
00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:03.701
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1708
00:48:03.701 --> 00:48:04.090
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1709
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.520
<v Speaker 3>that would be a great use of it.</v>

1710
00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.410
<v Speaker 3>And it's just,</v>

1711
00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.000
<v Speaker 3>and it's so silly because it's,</v>

1712
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:08.531
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1713
00:48:08.531 --> 00:48:09.080
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

1714
00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:09.220
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

1715
00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.210
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of the point,</v>

1716
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:11.463
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1717
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.550
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1718
00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:13.301
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1719
00:48:13.301 --> 00:48:15.820
<v Speaker 3>that's when religion for me gets narrow minded and just,</v>

1720
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:16.330
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

1721
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.560
<v Speaker 3>I can't follow that path.</v>

1722
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.020
<v Speaker 3>So what you say is that you benefit from it,</v>

1723
00:48:20.021 --> 00:48:24.190
<v Speaker 3>you felt you find benefit from the knowledge I've taken from it and I don't,</v>

1724
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:25.150
<v Speaker 3>I'll never,</v>

1725
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:30.150
<v Speaker 3>I mean you could say I'm Christian and Islam and Muslim because I've practiced</v>

1726
00:48:31.361 --> 00:48:32.260
<v Speaker 3>both in my life.</v>

1727
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:35.560
<v Speaker 3>You were talking earlier about Catholicism.</v>

1728
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:36.880
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

1729
00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:40.450
<v Speaker 3>I was raised like in going to catechism school and all that and learning the</v>

1730
00:48:40.451 --> 00:48:40.900
<v Speaker 3>lessons.</v>

1731
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:42.580
<v Speaker 3>And then at 14 I had the,</v>

1732
00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1733
00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:44.131
<v Speaker 3>what they call it,</v>

1734
00:48:44.131 --> 00:48:45.100
<v Speaker 3>confirmation,</v>

1735
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:50.200
<v Speaker 3>which was you go before the bishop and you basically do this thing and you can,</v>

1736
00:48:50.201 --> 00:48:50.330
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1737
00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:53.280
<v Speaker 3>it's like you're sort of Bar Mitzvah of a Christian and Annette,</v>

1738
00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.180
<v Speaker 3>that symbolic way.</v>

1739
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.400
<v Speaker 3>We didn't get any checks or big parties.</v>

1740
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.823
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1742
00:48:59.171 --> 00:49:00.370
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a big of like that.</v>

1743
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:00.881
<v Speaker 3>It was just kind of,</v>

1744
00:49:00.881 --> 00:49:03.820
<v Speaker 3>you go there and you're a man now and you get the Holy Spirit is supposed to</v>

1745
00:49:03.821 --> 00:49:04.654
<v Speaker 3>come down in you.</v>

1746
00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.370
<v Speaker 3>And I was buying in at that age,</v>

1747
00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:06.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1748
00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.151
<v Speaker 3>I mean I bought in,</v>

1749
00:49:07.151 --> 00:49:10.870
<v Speaker 3>I was going to it all and I remember sitting there and the church and the guy</v>

1750
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:13.840
<v Speaker 3>anoints you with the thing and you say the words and I'm walking back and I sit</v>

1751
00:49:13.841 --> 00:49:15.100
<v Speaker 3>down in my pew and I'm like,</v>

1752
00:49:15.101 --> 00:49:15.880
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1753
00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:16.661
<v Speaker 3>it's going to have another,</v>

1754
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:17.650
<v Speaker 3>kids are kind of act,</v>

1755
00:49:17.651 --> 00:49:18.360
<v Speaker 3>act not.</v>

1756
00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:18.910
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't like,</v>

1757
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:19.211
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1758
00:49:19.211 --> 00:49:19.751
<v Speaker 3>this happened to me.</v>

1759
00:49:19.751 --> 00:49:23.530
<v Speaker 3>Book kids were like happy in the Aa and I just didn't feel it goddamn thing.</v>

1760
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.800
<v Speaker 3>And for me it wasn't that I thought religion was bullshit.</v>

1761
00:49:26.801 --> 00:49:27.760
<v Speaker 3>Like how you turned.</v>

1762
00:49:27.761 --> 00:49:28.630
<v Speaker 3>That was for me it was like,</v>

1763
00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:29.021
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

1764
00:49:29.021 --> 00:49:29.920
<v Speaker 3>there's something wrong with me.</v>

1765
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:31.950
<v Speaker 3>Oh for a long time.</v>

1766
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:33.063
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1767
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:33.941
<v Speaker 3>And then like I said,</v>

1768
00:49:33.941 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 3>I found this other thing that Kinda was accepted me on my own,</v>

1769
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:39.341
<v Speaker 3>on my own terms.</v>

1770
00:49:39.341 --> 00:49:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1771
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:41.620
<v Speaker 3>nobody introduced me to Islam personally.</v>

1772
00:49:41.621 --> 00:49:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Nobody said this is what you should think or believe or here's something for you</v>

1773
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:45.304
<v Speaker 3>to read.</v>

1774
00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.280
<v Speaker 3>This stuff fell into my lap and I was like,</v>

1775
00:49:48.281 --> 00:49:48.731
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

1776
00:49:48.731 --> 00:49:52.900
<v Speaker 3>I follow signs and so that got me through a very,</v>

1777
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.530
<v Speaker 3>I believe like that philosophy and the way it took my mind are one of the</v>

1778
00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:57.700
<v Speaker 3>reasons I'm still alive today.</v>

1779
00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:58.860
<v Speaker 3>I think there's some great,</v>

1780
00:49:58.861 --> 00:49:58.980
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1781
00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:03.540
<v Speaker 1>lessons and a lot of organized religion and some great lessons and in both the</v>

1782
00:50:03.541 --> 00:50:06.360
<v Speaker 1>Bible and the Koran and the tour,</v>

1783
00:50:06.361 --> 00:50:07.560
<v Speaker 1>this is a great lessons in there.</v>

1784
00:50:07.561 --> 00:50:12.561
<v Speaker 1>The problem is they're old as fuck and they need to be updated like they need.</v>

1785
00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:13.741
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>

1786
00:50:13.741 --> 00:50:17.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad thing to have something like a Bible,</v>

1787
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:21.930
<v Speaker 1>but it's a bad thing to have some old shit that nobody truly understands and not</v>

1788
00:50:21.931 --> 00:50:26.931
<v Speaker 1>have some just guidelines of how to live life and be a happy,</v>

1789
00:50:27.741 --> 00:50:29.570
<v Speaker 1>healthy person and don't,</v>

1790
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:29.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1791
00:50:29.991 --> 00:50:31.870
<v Speaker 1>don't necessarily say that they came</v>

1792
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:34.210
<v Speaker 1>from anywhere.</v>

1793
00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:35.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where the fuck they can't from.</v>

1794
00:50:35.921 --> 00:50:39.010
<v Speaker 1>But these are things that people have accumulated and we figured out in time</v>

1795
00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:39.790
<v Speaker 1>what's up.</v>

00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:29.301
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2009
00:58:29.301 --> 00:58:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2010
00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's going on with that.</v>

2011
00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.211
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2012
00:58:32.211 --> 00:58:32.841
<v Speaker 1>it's heated up.</v>

2013
00:58:32.841 --> 00:58:33.890
<v Speaker 1>It's in the news all the time.</v>

2014
00:58:34.040 --> 00:58:34.240
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2015
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:35.570
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating the case man.</v>

2016
00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:38.300
<v Speaker 1>People are in real trouble for manipulating the news.</v>

2017
00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:39.291
<v Speaker 1>The way they,</v>

2018
00:58:39.291 --> 00:58:39.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2019
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:40.490
<v Speaker 1>they portrayed it.</v>

2020
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:42.950
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were under the impression that that was like a little kid.</v>

2021
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.010
<v Speaker 1>There was like really small and those were like really old pictures of him.</v>

2022
00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:46.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2023
00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 1>he's a much larger kid and they,</v>

2024
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:50.870
<v Speaker 1>he beat the fuck out of that guy before the guy shot him,</v>

2025
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.610
<v Speaker 1>he had blood all over his head.</v>

2026
00:58:52.611 --> 00:58:53.990
<v Speaker 1>His nose is punched in.</v>

2027
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.270
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of weird shit as to whether or not,</v>

2028
00:58:56.300 --> 00:59:00.200
<v Speaker 1>you know he was a victim or he was an asshole and that he shouldn't have been</v>

2029
00:59:00.201 --> 00:59:01.190
<v Speaker 1>doing in the first place.</v>

2030
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:01.761
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

2031
00:59:01.761 --> 00:59:03.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a very racially divisive issue,</v>

2032
00:59:03.711 --> 00:59:04.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2033
00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:05.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really fucked up issue.</v>

2034
00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:06.403
<v Speaker 1>He's alive though.</v>

2035
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:07.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2036
00:59:07.071 --> 00:59:07.904
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

2037
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:08.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2038
00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:09.590
<v Speaker 1>You could take a punch in the nose.</v>

2039
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:11.030
<v Speaker 1>You can apologize for that.</v>

2040
00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:11.890
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

2041
00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:12.260
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

2042
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:12.920
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2043
00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:13.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2044
00:59:13.191 --> 00:59:13.911
<v Speaker 1>you know what man,</v>

2045
00:59:13.911 --> 00:59:16.400
<v Speaker 1>if he thought that dude was going to kill it right or wrong and I'm outside,</v>

2046
00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:18.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying like one dude's alive,</v>

2047
00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:21.410
<v Speaker 1>one dude's dead and one dude was following another dude when he have been.</v>

2048
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.801
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

2049
00:59:21.801 --> 00:59:22.820
<v Speaker 1>apparently that's not true.</v>

2050
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:24.260
<v Speaker 1>Apparently a,</v>

2051
00:59:24.261 --> 00:59:25.850
<v Speaker 1>that was something that was also reported.</v>

2052
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:26.480
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't true.</v>

2053
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:26.791
<v Speaker 1>He didn't,</v>

2054
00:59:26.791 --> 00:59:27.770
<v Speaker 1>they didn't follow that kid.</v>

2055
00:59:27.771 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they told him to stop and he got in his car and the kid was looking</v>

2056
00:59:30.531 --> 00:59:31.364
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>

2057
00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 1>But who the fuck knows?</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know when,</v>

2059
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:34.400
<v Speaker 1>when something like that happens?</v>

2060
00:59:34.401 --> 00:59:35.031
<v Speaker 1>I never heard that,</v>

2061

<v Speaker 1>A lot of people that's going to be the anthem.</v>

2119
01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just me saying like I said,</v>

2120
01:00:43.791 --> 01:00:44.840
<v Speaker 1>what if God is real?</v>

2121
01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>And then legends all just a big lie,</v>

2122
01:00:46.941 --> 01:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2123
01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:47.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2125
01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda how I look at it.</v>

2126
01:00:48.981 --> 01:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>Like God might be real man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

2128
01:00:51.591 --> 01:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>I kind of feel like it is whatever it is.</v>

2129
01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.213
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

2130
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>it's beneficial or not going to be pleased with them.</v>

2131
01:00:57.461 --> 01:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Motherfuckers murdering each other over the rules.</v>

2132
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's beneficial.</v>

2133
01:01:01.861 --> 01:01:03.320
<v Speaker 1>There's one rule that we all,</v>

2134
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:03.921
<v Speaker 1>we all know it,</v>

2135
01:01:03.921 --> 01:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2136
01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Do one to others.</v>

2137
01:01:06.110 --> 01:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule that it really is.</v>

2138
01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>That's the only rule.</v>

2139
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I think it's beneficial to be humbled by religion actually is the last line in</v>

2140
01:01:13.251 --> 01:01:13.671
<v Speaker 1>that song.</v>

<v Speaker 1>gotten on an airplane.</v>

2146

01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:26.581
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2151
01:01:26.581 --> 01:01:28.620

2154
01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's connecting you with a spirit of nature.</v>

2158
01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:41.540
<v Speaker 1>It made you paranoid.</v>

2159
01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:41.961

<v Speaker 1>made you have all these crazy thoughts cause it's connecting you to the spirit</v>

2162
01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>of nature,</v>

2163
01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>the mother Earth Gaia in a little baby dose of a plant love.</v>

2164
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And that baby dose of plant love just sparks every cannabinoid receptor in your</v>

2165
01:01:57.141 --> 01:01:58.490
<v Speaker 1>fucking monkey brain.</v>

2177
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:23.190
<v Speaker 6>the fact that you were tuned into some other form of intelligence.</v>

2178
01:02:23.191 --> 01:02:26.940
<v Speaker 6>You could accept the fact that there's something about this thing that's making</v>

2179
01:02:26.941 --> 01:02:30.540
<v Speaker 6>ideas explode inside of your brain and never been there before.</v>

2212
01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:34.710
<v Speaker 6>I apologize with all my heart.</v>

2213
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.480
<v Speaker 6>I did not think that that was kind of distract you dude.</v>

2214
01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:39.980
<v Speaker 6>I've done it to every interview ever cause I won't turn off my phone,</v>

2215
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:41.020
<v Speaker 6>God forbid in case on it.</v>

2216
01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.310
<v Speaker 6>And it wasn't a judgment.</v>

2217
01:03:43.311 --> 01:03:44.310
<v Speaker 6>It was just like I just couldn't,</v>

2218
01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.900
<v Speaker 6>I had the cords in my hand,</v>

2219
01:03:46.901 --> 01:03:49.560
<v Speaker 6>started playing another song and then lyrics from another song.</v>

2220
01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:50.573
<v Speaker 6>It's like some weird,</v>

2221
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.140
<v Speaker 6>I've never written anything down.</v>

2222
01:03:52.410 --> 01:03:54.830
<v Speaker 6>So it's like if a,</v>

2223
01:03:54.930 --> 01:03:57.360
<v Speaker 6>if a picture gets cross referenced it,</v>

2224
01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:57.621
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2225
01:03:57.621 --> 01:03:58.454
<v Speaker 6>I'm fucked.</v>

2226
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:01.080
<v Speaker 6>That is such a fascinating way to do your music.</v>

2227
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:02.330
<v Speaker 6>I know Jay Dee Dee,</v>

2228
01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.140
<v Speaker 6>Jay z does his raps that way too.</v>

2229
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:05.940
<v Speaker 6>I think that's really fascinating.</v>

2230
01:04:06.210 --> 01:04:07.070
<v Speaker 6>I mean for me it's,</v>

2231
01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:10.290
<v Speaker 6>again I think we discussed it but it's like it started as like a wrap thing.</v>

2232
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.060
<v Speaker 6>Having a hall right here,</v>

2233
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:13.363
<v Speaker 6>I don't need it.</v>

2234
01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:15.300
<v Speaker 6>Well you probably should,</v>

2235
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:15.721
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2236
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:18.510
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's probably some benefit to having it all right there.</v>

2237
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.770
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2238
01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:23.070
<v Speaker 6>be able to pull out at anytime you want instead of relying on pieces of paper</v>

2239
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:24.870
<v Speaker 6>and you record it all.</v>

2240
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:25.550
<v Speaker 6>And like I said,</v>

2241
01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:27.790
<v Speaker 6>when I open my eyes and saw something and,</v>

2242
01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:28.860
<v Speaker 6>and then your brains,</v>

2243
01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:29.131
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2244
01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:30.720
<v Speaker 6>automatically is asking questions.</v>

2245
01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.111
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

2246
01:04:31.111 --> 01:04:31.561
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

2247
01:04:31.561 --> 01:04:32.101
<v Speaker 6>It's not even,</v>

2248
01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:32.671
<v Speaker 6>it's just like,</v>

2249
01:04:32.671 --> 01:04:33.720
<v Speaker 6>that's not even like fuck Joe.</v>

2250
01:04:33.721 --> 01:04:34.880
<v Speaker 6>It's like what's going on?</v>

2251
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:38.140
<v Speaker 6>Something bad happening and that's enough that the songs gone.</v>

2252
01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.053
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

2253
01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.480
<v Speaker 6>I think it's cool for people to just get my fucking eyes closed is what I should</v>

2254
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:43.343
<v Speaker 6>did.</v>

2255
01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:44.700
<v Speaker 6>That's what I,</v>

2256
01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.610
<v Speaker 6>that's why I closed my eyes a lot during performances cause it's sometimes some</v>

2257
01:04:47.611 --> 01:04:50.010
<v Speaker 6>mother fucker will turn around and like do his Facebook photo,</v>

2263

2266
01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:06.520
<v Speaker 6>living.</v>

2267

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:33.993
<v Speaker 5>edge.</v>

<v Speaker 6>don't.</v>

2312
01:08:59.410 --> 01:08:59.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2313
01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.000
<v Speaker 6>Almost always.</v>

2314
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:03.130
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's happiness in it,</v>

2316
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:04.151
<v Speaker 6>but you pay with,</v>

2317
01:09:04.151 --> 01:09:04.984
<v Speaker 6>oh yeah,</v>

2318

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2321
01:09:06.311 --> 01:09:07.560
<v Speaker 6>There's the bad.</v>

2322
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.730
<v Speaker 6>This whole little bit.</v>

2323
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:11.250
<v Speaker 6>All the interesting people do that.</v>

2324
01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:12.093
<v Speaker 6>Unfortunately.</v>

2325
01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:15.040
<v Speaker 6>I hate giving people the impression that you have to make sad music though.</v>

2326
01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:15.791
<v Speaker 6>Cause I mean I,</v>

2327
01:09:15.791 --> 01:09:16.870
<v Speaker 6>it's just not what I do.</v>

2328
01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:18.280
<v Speaker 6>When you are happy music,</v>

2329
01:09:18.750 --> 01:09:19.583
<v Speaker 6>not,</v>

2330
01:09:19.770 --> 01:09:21.190
<v Speaker 6>I can't write that song,</v>

2331
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:23.260
<v Speaker 6>jump around.</v>

2332
01:09:23.290 --> 01:09:23.970
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2333
01:09:23.970 --> 01:09:24.803
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2334
01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.900
<v Speaker 6>that's just a whole different different time to write for you.</v>

2335
01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:29.710
<v Speaker 6>Do you hear like that old stuff like the,</v>

2336
01:09:29.711 --> 01:09:29.861
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

2337
01:09:29.861 --> 01:09:31.210
<v Speaker 6>the rap stuff and go like,</v>

2338
01:09:31.211 --> 01:09:31.421
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

2339
01:09:31.421 --> 01:09:32.470
<v Speaker 6>that's like a different time.</v>

2340
01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:33.610
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2341
01:09:33.610 --> 01:09:33.860
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2342
01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.890
<v Speaker 6>My voice and I know I'm just a baby.</v>

2343
01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:36.933
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2344
01:09:37.210 --> 01:09:37.841
<v Speaker 6>I haven't even had,</v>

2345
01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:40.600
<v Speaker 6>I didn't even find my voice until like the third house of Payne record.</v>

2346
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.250
<v Speaker 6>It's weird isn't it?</v>

2347
01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:45.130
<v Speaker 6>When you look back on all the shit that you've done and it took me like three</v>

2348
01:09:45.131 --> 01:09:46.660
<v Speaker 6>albums to find my singing voice.</v>

2349
01:09:46.661 --> 01:09:47.051
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2350
01:09:47.051 --> 01:09:48.130
<v Speaker 6>Like Whitey Ford isn't,</v>

2351
01:09:48.131 --> 01:09:49.180
<v Speaker 6>when I find a singing,</v>

2352
01:09:49.181 --> 01:09:49.961
<v Speaker 6>it's good work,</v>

2353
01:09:49.961 --> 01:09:51.220
<v Speaker 6>but it's not my best.</v>

2354
01:09:51.570 --> 01:09:55.030
<v Speaker 6>Like thank God nobody talked you out of putting out that record.</v>

2355
01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.410
<v Speaker 6>Tell that story.</v>

2356
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.901
<v Speaker 6>Cause Tom,</v>

2357
01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:57.100
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2358
01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:57.933
<v Speaker 6>they tried.</v>

2359
01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:01.780
<v Speaker 6>That is so frustrating to me because it's always the case where people just,</v>

2360
01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.130
<v Speaker 6>for whatever reason,</v>

2361
01:10:03.131 --> 01:10:03.420
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2362
01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:05.260
<v Speaker 6>they don't ever want to accept that a dude.</v>

2363
01:10:05.261 --> 01:10:07.510
<v Speaker 6>Like you could do more than one different kind of thing,</v>

2364
01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.433
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

2365
01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:10.691
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2366
01:10:10.691 --> 01:10:11.450
<v Speaker 6>I hear that man.</v>

2367
01:10:11.450 --> 01:10:12.283
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2368
01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:13.631
<v Speaker 6>I just,</v>

2369
01:10:13.631 --> 01:10:13.991
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>

2370
01:10:13.991 --> 01:10:15.100
<v Speaker 6>I follow the signs.</v>

2371
01:10:15.130 --> 01:10:16.740
<v Speaker 6>I just Kinda of go back.</v>

2372
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:17.770
<v Speaker 6>I got,</v>

2373
01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:18.490
<v Speaker 6>I got,</v>

2374
01:10:18.490 --> 01:10:21.370
<v Speaker 6>I got to the point in house pain where I felt like I was showing up for the</v>

2375
01:10:21.371 --> 01:10:25.120
<v Speaker 6>checks and that made me feel rather core link.</v>

2376
01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.400
<v Speaker 6>It must be hard to do things with a bunch of dudes,</v>

2377
01:10:27.401 --> 01:10:28.480
<v Speaker 6>even if you love him too,</v>

2378
01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.850
<v Speaker 6>even if you love him.</v>

2379
01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:30.551
<v Speaker 6>Just to throw one.</v>

2380
01:10:30.551 --> 01:10:34.300
<v Speaker 6>Writing songs with a bunch of other dudes seems like a nightmare.</v>

2381
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.581
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2382
01:10:34.581 --> 01:10:38.060
<v Speaker 3>musically I was doing more than my share of the work,</v>

2383
01:10:38.061 --> 01:10:38.960
<v Speaker 3>so I'm sure.</v>

2384
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>

2385
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:40.191
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

2386
01:10:40.191 --> 01:10:41.270
<v Speaker 3>it just became not fun.</v>

2387
01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.230
<v Speaker 3>That's really what it was.</v>

2388
01:10:42.231 --> 01:10:42.561
<v Speaker 3>It just do.</v>

2389
01:10:42.561 --> 01:10:43.341
<v Speaker 3>It became a point where,</v>

2390
01:10:43.341 --> 01:10:47.260
<v Speaker 3>and luckily I'm spoiled rotten enough in my life that isn't,</v>

2391
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.991
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't fun.</v>

2392
01:10:47.991 --> 01:10:48.770
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't doing it.</v>

2393
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2394
01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.211
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't care.</v>

2395
01:10:50.211 --> 01:10:50.481
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

2396
01:10:50.481 --> 01:10:52.730
<v Speaker 3>And the thing was I wasn't Uber rich when I quit house of pain.</v>

2397
01:10:52.731 --> 01:10:53.001
<v Speaker 3>I was,</v>

2398
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't,</v>

2399
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I had a few bucks,</v>

2400
01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.630
<v Speaker 3>but like it was going to be like,</v>

2401
01:10:56.631 --> 01:10:57.440
<v Speaker 3>what's next?</v>

2402
01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:57.981
<v Speaker 3>Like in life,</v>

2403
01:10:57.981 --> 01:11:00.650
<v Speaker 3>what's the next day is I didn't know if I was going to make another record at</v>

2404
01:11:00.651 --> 01:11:01.484
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

2405
01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.100
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2406
01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:03.470

2415
01:11:23.071 --> 01:11:23.611
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have,</v>

2416
01:11:23.611 --> 01:11:23.791

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

2421
01:11:29.670 --> 01:11:30.091
<v Speaker 3>There was a,</v>

2422
01:11:30.091 --> 01:11:33.690
<v Speaker 3>there's a very few songs that are guaranteed to give me goosebumps.</v>

2423
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:36.250
<v Speaker 1>But that song that you did with Carlos Santana,</v>

2424
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:37.120
<v Speaker 1>the key,</v>

2425
01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:37.901
<v Speaker 1>turn your lights on.</v>

2426

2427
01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:39.431
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

2428
01:11:39.431 --> 01:11:40.990
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my all time favorite songs,</v>

2429
01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:41.501
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2430
01:11:41.501 --> 01:11:42.270
<v Speaker 1>that song.</v>

2431
01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:44.170
<v Speaker 1>But before you even pick up a guitar,</v>

2432
01:11:44.380 --> 01:11:46.090
<v Speaker 1>there's some about that song where you know,</v>

2433
01:11:46.091 --> 01:11:48.130
<v Speaker 1>when a dude saying something where there's a,</v>

2434
01:11:48.131 --> 01:11:53.110
<v Speaker 1>there's an authentic pain being expressed as an authentic emotion.</v>

2435
01:11:53.111 --> 01:11:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Every word is like every word is qualified.</v>

2436
01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean by an experience.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like half a million.</v>

2482
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:16.130
<v Speaker 3>So you went a million dollar swing in like a day,</v>

2483
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:17.600
<v Speaker 3>let's call it a week.</v>

2484
01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:18.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2485
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:20.030
<v Speaker 3>You hear in the news about getting screwed.</v>

2486
01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:25.410
<v Speaker 3>But then I had this song and somebody says Santana's looking for a song and sent</v>

2487
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:27.170
<v Speaker 3>it and we talked about the rest man.</v>

2489
01:13:29.241 --> 01:13:30.980
<v Speaker 3>He called it the centerpiece of his wreck.</v>

2490
01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:32.301
<v Speaker 3>I'm proud of that.</v>

2491
01:13:32.301 --> 01:13:33.134
<v Speaker 3>I'm proud of that.</v>

2497
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:44.570

<v Speaker 1>or by the time everybody listens to that old Carlos Santana,</v>

2499
01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:49.900
<v Speaker 1>he was speaking to this.</v>

2500
01:13:49.901 --> 01:13:52.150
<v Speaker 1>I found a rock on the beach yesterday.</v>

2501
01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I was with my kids and we found this rock and how there's holes in it.</v>

2502
01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:55.601
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like what is this?</v>

2506
01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.240
<v Speaker 1>And so I put on Twitter,</v>

2507
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.691
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2508

<v Speaker 1>So many of them too.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You put that on somebody in that bars and be like Aerosmith.</v>

2536
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:52.743
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2537
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Boston,</v>

2538
01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:55.660
<v Speaker 1>so Aerosmith has royalty there.</v>

2539
01:14:55.661 --> 01:14:56.530
<v Speaker 1>Boston royalty.</v>

2540
01:14:56.710 --> 01:14:57.730
<v Speaker 1>They came from Boston,</v>

2541
01:14:57.731 --> 01:14:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2542
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh that early shit,</v>

2543
01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:00.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2544
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.001
<v Speaker 1>walk this way.</v>

2545
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:02.560
<v Speaker 1>It was tremendous,</v>

2546
01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:05.860
<v Speaker 1>tremendous fuel those guys had behind them.</v>

2547
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:08.950
<v Speaker 1>But then eventually it became ballads and he's not only,</v>

2548
01:15:08.951 --> 01:15:10.540
<v Speaker 1>but the shocking thing is not that he follows you.</v>

2549
01:15:10.541 --> 01:15:10.870
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

2550
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it's that he's a goddamn gem.</v>

2551
01:15:12.551 --> 01:15:13.460
<v Speaker 1>Ologist or whatever.</v>

2552
01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Well I think he's a part of that whole rock for science thing.</v>

2553
01:15:18.161 --> 01:15:19.030
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it's called?</v>

2554
01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:19.391

<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

2568
01:15:32.740 --> 01:15:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a,</v>

2569
01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't have said that because I don't know the information.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the Rock Stars of science.</v>

2578
01:15:43.661 --> 01:15:44.290

01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:46.150
<v Speaker 1>Rock Stars of Science.</v>

2581
01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:46.631
<v Speaker 1>And they're,</v>

2582
01:15:46.631 --> 01:15:50.500
<v Speaker 1>what they're trying to do is get kids to be excited about science.</v>

2583
01:15:50.650 --> 01:15:53.410
<v Speaker 1>So you've got people like they're following Joe Perry</v>

2600
01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:21.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of people in here and then a bunch of science people.</v>

2601
01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:22.330
<v Speaker 1>This is interesting.</v>

2602
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:23.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's actually a show.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2604
01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not rock stars and science.</v>

2605
01:16:27.190 --> 01:16:28.530
<v Speaker 1>What was Andy do frame in,</v>

2606

<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2607
01:16:28.881 --> 01:16:29.650
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

2608
01:16:29.650 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 1>in that movie he liked to shape the rocks.</v>

2609
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:34.370
<v Speaker 1>And what did they call that tall?</v>

2610
01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.253
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

2611
01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:37.421
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2612
01:16:37.421 --> 01:16:39.490
<v Speaker 1>It didn't sound like Jamal and just as someone who,</v>

2613
01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:39.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like his studies rocks,</v>

2615
01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:41.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2616
01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Just all rock geologists though.</v>

2617
01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:44.280
<v Speaker 1>That's geologists,</v>

2618
01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.200
<v Speaker 1>gem ologists like someone to study jams.</v>

2619
01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Those Jews in the diamond business,</v>

2620
01:16:50.411 --> 01:16:50.861
<v Speaker 1>that movie,</v>

2621
01:16:50.861 --> 01:16:51.840
<v Speaker 1>the Shawshank Redemption,</v>

2622
01:16:52.050 --> 01:16:52.600
<v Speaker 1>they're moving,</v>

2623
01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:53.680
<v Speaker 1>they called him something in that,</v>

2624
01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.200
<v Speaker 1>that diamonds are like very pretty.</v>

2625
01:16:56.230 --> 01:16:57.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no mistaking that,</v>

2626
01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.151
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

2627
01:16:58.151 --> 01:17:01.400
<v Speaker 1>what an amazing job they've done in making diamonds like this.</v>

2628
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:02.650
<v Speaker 1>A valuable commodity.</v>

2629
01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Storing them in a warehouse and releasing them.</v>

2630
01:17:05.381 --> 01:17:07.450
<v Speaker 1>One that you keep in the prices elevated.</v>

2631
01:17:08.190 --> 01:17:08.711
<v Speaker 1>That's a meme,</v>

2632
01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:08.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2633
01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Their diamonds are very pretty</v>

2634
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.481
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2635
01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:12.320
<v Speaker 3>they are Brian.</v>

2636
01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:12.981
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2637
01:17:12.981 --> 01:17:14.600
<v Speaker 3>That's why people are willing to pay money for him,</v>

2638
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.823
<v Speaker 3>but it's fashioned.</v>

2639
01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:17.960
<v Speaker 3>Keeps so many Australian market.</v>

2640
01:17:17.961 --> 01:17:18.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2641
01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.010
<v Speaker 3>it's brilliant.</v>

2642
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:20.000
<v Speaker 3>The way they're done is brilliant.</v>

2643
01:17:20.210 --> 01:17:20.850
<v Speaker 3>You can,</v>

2644
01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:24.240
<v Speaker 3>isn't it kind of modeled after the gas industry hasn't of just the work.</v>

2645
01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:25.083
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2646
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:28.370
<v Speaker 3>I take it that's almost the same principle sort of all these countries.</v>

2647
01:17:28.371 --> 01:17:29.600
<v Speaker 3>We have so much in reserve,</v>

2648
01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:30.050
<v Speaker 3>but yet,</v>

2649
01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:30.471
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

2650
01:17:30.471 --> 01:17:32.000
<v Speaker 3>It's the cast is necessary.</v>

2651
01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.820
<v Speaker 3>Diamonds that serves.</v>

2652
01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:34.221
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

2653
01:17:34.221 --> 01:17:34.520
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

2654
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.750
<v Speaker 3>That's much more gangster talk people into buying a shiny rock for no fucking</v>

2655
01:17:38.751 --> 01:17:39.150
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

2656
01:17:39.150 --> 01:17:40.510
<v Speaker 3>It's marginally talks people into it,</v>

2657
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:43.710
<v Speaker 3>but it's like you have to buy it for the woman you love half tablet.</v>

2658
01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:44.361
<v Speaker 3>The genius.</v>

2659
01:17:44.361 --> 01:17:44.741
<v Speaker 3>She was like,</v>

2660
01:17:44.741 --> 01:17:46.070
<v Speaker 3>it's part of society now.</v>

2661
01:17:46.071 --> 01:17:50.990
<v Speaker 3>Like that's you're expected to buy a diamond ring for an engagement or wedding</v>

2662
01:17:50.991 --> 01:17:51.710
<v Speaker 3>or whatever.</v>

2663
01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:52.640
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's expected.</v>

2664
01:17:52.641 --> 01:17:55.280
<v Speaker 3>You cast your Dalry he can't be coming home with no rubies.</v>

2665
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.611
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2666
01:17:55.611 --> 01:17:58.520
<v Speaker 3>that's your dowery and it has to be like three months salary.</v>

2667
01:17:59.080 --> 01:17:59.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2668
01:17:59.270 --> 01:18:01.400
<v Speaker 3>What's so good fucking assholes.</v>

2669
01:18:01.401 --> 01:18:02.730
<v Speaker 3>That's an asshole slogan.</v>

2670
01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:03.291
<v Speaker 3>Be honest though.</v>

2671
01:18:03.291 --> 01:18:04.740
<v Speaker 3>I wish I had only spent three minutes.</v>

2672
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 3>Where were you then?</v>

2673
01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:11.211
<v Speaker 3>It's a slogan,</v>

2674
01:18:11.211 --> 01:18:11.391
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2675

<v Speaker 3>It's like have it your way at Burger King.</v>

2676
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.460
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2677
01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:15.110
<v Speaker 3>they're just selling shitty cheeseburgers,</v>

2678
01:18:15.111 --> 01:18:15.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2679
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:15.770
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:17.390
<v Speaker 3>don't try to make it is,</v>

2681
01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:20.660
<v Speaker 3>my wife has an official one engagement ring.</v>

2682
01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:24.380
<v Speaker 3>When I flew I flew her to Paris.</v>

2683
01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.281
<v Speaker 3>Just kinda like,</v>

2684
01:18:25.281 --> 01:18:26.240
<v Speaker 3>I decided it was like,</v>

2685
01:18:26.241 --> 01:18:27.040
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2686
01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.100
<v Speaker 3>it's time Paris.</v>

2687
01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:28.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2688
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:29.323
<v Speaker 3>I was on tour.</v>

2689
01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:30.920
<v Speaker 3>Oh well I flew her like out to Europe.</v>

2690
01:18:30.921 --> 01:18:32.000
<v Speaker 3>We hit Amsterdam and few other places,</v>

2691
01:18:32.010 --> 01:18:32.270
<v Speaker 3>but I,</v>

2692
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:34.460
<v Speaker 3>my plan was Paris midnight,</v>

2693
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:36.670
<v Speaker 3>Eiffel Tower movie style.</v>

2694
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:37.580
<v Speaker 3>That's bad ass.</v>

2695
01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:40.430
<v Speaker 3>But like I knew I had a jewelry guy here at home.</v>

2696
01:18:40.431 --> 01:18:41.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you know who he is.</v>

2697
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:43.010
<v Speaker 3>Dana put me onto him.</v>

2698
01:18:43.130 --> 01:18:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2699
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:44.780
<v Speaker 3>So he was,</v>

2700
01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:45.201
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2701
01:18:45.201 --> 01:18:45.771
<v Speaker 3>I got you.</v>

2702
01:18:45.771 --> 01:18:46.401
<v Speaker 3>So when you get back.</v>

2703
01:18:46.401 --> 01:18:46.761
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>

2704
01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:47.361
<v Speaker 3>I gotta do this.</v>

2705
01:18:47.361 --> 01:18:49.100
<v Speaker 3>So I went into a little London,</v>

2706
01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:51.860
<v Speaker 3>a jewelry store and bought like,</v>

2707
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:52.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2708
01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:57.160
<v Speaker 3>$500 little sliver diamond ring and you know my wife treasures that just as much</v>

2709
01:18:57.531 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 3>as the other one because that's when I gave her at the thing</v>

2710
01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:01.690
<v Speaker 3>I did.</v>

2711
01:19:01.690 --> 01:19:01.961
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2712
01:19:01.961 --> 01:19:02.120
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

2713
01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:03.480
<v Speaker 3>like you would have saved me a lot of bread.</v>

2714
01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:08.060
<v Speaker 3>Well I think they like both but it's a weird,</v>

2715
01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:10.100
<v Speaker 3>this one is special because this one came,</v>

2716
01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:11.660
<v Speaker 3>this one is,</v>

2717
01:19:11.660 --> 01:19:11.871
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2718
01:19:11.871 --> 01:19:13.040
<v Speaker 3>that makes this one special.</v>

2719
01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:13.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2720
01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.940
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird thing that people are willing to spend so much money on some little</v>

2721
01:19:16.941 --> 01:19:17.960
<v Speaker 3>tiny piece of rock.</v>

2722
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:20.390
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't really do anything was that was very strange.</v>

2723
01:19:20.391 --> 01:19:21.224
<v Speaker 3>It was coal.</v>

2724
01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2725
01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:22.803
<v Speaker 3>Long time ago.</v>

2726
01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:26.540
<v Speaker 3>It was a thing in wired magazine years back where there was a guy who was using</v>

2727
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Russian technology and he was creating diamonds and the significant ones like up</v>

2728
01:19:30.651 --> 01:19:31.880
<v Speaker 3>to two and three carrots I think.</v>

2729
01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.400
<v Speaker 3>And they were also making different color ones,</v>

2730
01:19:34.401 --> 01:19:35.270
<v Speaker 3>which are really rare,</v>

2731
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:35.891
<v Speaker 3>but they were able to,</v>

2732
01:19:35.891 --> 01:19:38.630
<v Speaker 3>I was just going to say I have an old like 20 year old,</v>

2733
01:19:38.631 --> 01:19:41.590
<v Speaker 3>like I have a canary yellow diamond pinky ring and it's like,</v>

2734
01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.050
<v Speaker 3>it was really,</v>

2735
01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:43.310
<v Speaker 3>it's really Rick because it's natural,</v>

2736
01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:45.080
<v Speaker 3>but nowadays it's like you can get them like,</v>

2737
01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:48.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's why all these guys have like rainbow fluorescent,</v>

2738
01:19:48.141 --> 01:19:49.040
<v Speaker 3>like diamond.</v>

2739
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.430
<v Speaker 3>Well that's all fake anyways.</v>

2740
01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:51.300
<v Speaker 3>90% of that shit.</v>

2741
01:19:51.310 --> 01:19:51.830
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2742
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:52.840
<v Speaker 3>But here's what's fascinating.</v>

2743
01:19:52.841 --> 01:19:54.260
<v Speaker 3>I have a great idea for a show,</v>

2747
01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:57.800

<v Speaker 6>A diamond tester.</v>

2758

2760
01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:16.050
<v Speaker 6>That'd be so rude.</v>

2761
01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:16.720

<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2767
01:20:20.251 --> 01:20:23.490
<v Speaker 6>There's guys walking around that that got like apartment complexes around their</v>

2768
01:20:23.491 --> 01:20:24.330
<v Speaker 6>neck if they're real.</v>

2769
01:20:24.990 --> 01:20:25.823
<v Speaker 6>And those dudes,</v>

2770
01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.753
<v Speaker 6>if they're real,</v>

2771
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.560
<v Speaker 6>I got guys that want to get at him.</v>

2772
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:30.660
<v Speaker 6>How rude that is.</v>

2773
01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:32.610
<v Speaker 6>Not Very Islam have you sir.</v>

2774
01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:35.070
<v Speaker 6>That is not very nice guys.</v>

2775
01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:36.060
<v Speaker 6>They weren't sure who they are,</v>

2776
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:36.894
<v Speaker 6>where they are.</v>

2777
01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:39.240
<v Speaker 6>This is what's fucked up about the machine that makes the diamonds.</v>

2778
01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:42.480
<v Speaker 6>I've talked to several women who said this exact same thing.</v>

2779
01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:47.070
<v Speaker 6>They say that those diamonds wouldn't be as valuable to them because they came</v>

2780
01:20:47.071 --> 01:20:50.550
<v Speaker 6>from a machine that they want the kind that comes from the ground and I'm like,</v>

2781
01:20:50.610 --> 01:20:53.220
<v Speaker 6>even if it's just perfectly exactly,</v>

2782
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:54.690
<v Speaker 6>exactly duplicated.</v>

2783
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:55.830
<v Speaker 6>It is a diamond.</v>

2784
01:20:55.831 --> 01:20:59.220
<v Speaker 6>Like the only way you can tell that this diamond and this is,</v>

2785
01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:00.150
<v Speaker 6>this is a fact,</v>

2786
01:21:00.151 --> 01:21:01.380
<v Speaker 6>like this is not a disputed thing.</v>

2787
01:21:01.381 --> 01:21:02.214
<v Speaker 6>The only way you could tell,</v>

2788
01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.850
<v Speaker 6>because if they tell you like they've taken these diamonds to gem ologists,</v>

2789
01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:07.410
<v Speaker 6>people work in the diamond trade,</v>

2790
01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:08.760
<v Speaker 6>the DeBeers group,</v>

2791
01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:12.630
<v Speaker 6>and they've looked at them and they cannot distinguish these from perfect</v>

2792
01:21:12.631 --> 01:21:13.440
<v Speaker 6>diamonds.</v>

2793
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:15.090
<v Speaker 6>Like they can make a perfect diamond.</v>

2794
01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.580
<v Speaker 6>So it's a real weird thing.</v>

2795
01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:18.520
<v Speaker 6>But for women,</v>

2796
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:20.100
<v Speaker 6>that's why we walk will lie to women.</v>

2797
01:21:20.220 --> 01:21:21.420
<v Speaker 6>It's a real weird thing.</v>

2798
01:21:21.421 --> 01:21:22.141
<v Speaker 6>But for women,</v>

2799
01:21:22.141 --> 01:21:26.190
<v Speaker 6>that thing is that the one that's more valuable is the one they want.</v>

2800
01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.780
<v Speaker 6>They want the one that costs more.</v>

2801
01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:29.273
<v Speaker 6>That's what I'm telling you.</v>

2802
01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:31.590
<v Speaker 6>It's the actually want it to be worth more.</v>

2803
01:21:31.591 --> 01:21:35.640
<v Speaker 6>They want some sort of twisted revenge on the fact that original marriage was</v>

2804
01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:40.880
<v Speaker 6>basically an exchange of pop property or a property for wife property to,</v>

2805
01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:42.880
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2806
01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.940
<v Speaker 6>become the daughter property because why property?</v>

2807
01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:45.810
<v Speaker 6>What are you giving me?</v>

2808
01:21:46.050 --> 01:21:49.500
<v Speaker 6>I think they do it for girls as much as they do it for themselves.</v>

2809
01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:53.280
<v Speaker 6>I think they do it to show other girls to have big as bowling ball on their</v>

2810
01:21:53.281 --> 01:21:53.611
<v Speaker 6>finger.</v>

2811
01:21:53.611 --> 01:21:54.540
<v Speaker 6>Look what he got me.</v>

2812
01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.350
<v Speaker 6>That's how I got my plus as,</v>

2813
01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:56.701
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2814
01:21:56.701 --> 01:21:57.101
<v Speaker 6>I'm looking at here.</v>

01:21:57.101 --> 01:21:57.570
<v Speaker 6>You got me.</v>

2816
01:21:57.570 --> 01:21:58.201

2817
01:21:58.201 --> 01:21:59.034
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2818

2820
01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:04.050
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2821

2865
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:13.730
<v Speaker 6>It's a race car.</v>

2866
01:23:13.730 --> 01:23:14.471
<v Speaker 6>It's ridiculous,</v>

2867
01:23:14.471 --> 01:23:15.304
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

2868
01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:16.690
<v Speaker 6>you're so connected.</v>

2869
01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:17.341
<v Speaker 6>You know what?</v>

2870
01:23:17.341 --> 01:23:21.130
<v Speaker 6>I'm a really been getting into man though recently really been getting into old</v>

2871
01:23:21.131 --> 01:23:21.964
<v Speaker 6>cars.</v>

2872
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.990
<v Speaker 6>Like when I look at like there's something to me like I went for a long time.</v>

2873
01:23:25.991 --> 01:23:28.090
<v Speaker 6>I didn't dig old cars because of my,</v>

2874
01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:29.390
<v Speaker 6>I had a bad experience with a car.</v>

2875
01:23:29.391 --> 01:23:31.780
<v Speaker 6>I had belt at a 1970 barracuda built.</v>

2876
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:32.470
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2877
01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:34.300
<v Speaker 6>But there's some about like old cars,</v>

2878
01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:34.781
<v Speaker 6>like if you get,</v>

2879
01:23:34.781 --> 01:23:36.640
<v Speaker 6>get them to run and drive them around,</v>

2880
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:38.290
<v Speaker 6>there's so much more satisfying.</v>

2881
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:42.610
<v Speaker 6>If you could actually get a 1969 Camaro and drive that motherfucker around,</v>

2882
01:23:42.820 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 6>you could actually get it to the point where you could actually drive it,</v>

2883
01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:47.740
<v Speaker 6>make sure that it stops when you want it to,</v>

2884
01:23:47.741 --> 01:23:49.600
<v Speaker 6>and make sure that blinkers work and all that bullshit.</v>

2885
01:23:49.810 --> 01:23:52.030
<v Speaker 6>If you could like get it shipped down to that point,</v>

2886
01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:53.380
<v Speaker 6>you're in a,</v>

2887
01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:55.240
<v Speaker 6>you're on a goddamn time machine.</v>

2888
01:23:55.390 --> 01:24:00.390
<v Speaker 6>You're driving around in a a working piece of art that sounds like fun,</v>

2889
01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.720
<v Speaker 6>like a giant Dick roaring as it goes down the street.</v>

2890
01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:06.670
<v Speaker 6>Everyone old car I want to build,</v>

2891
01:24:06.671 --> 01:24:08.350
<v Speaker 6>but I haven't found the right one yet.</v>

2892
01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:09.110
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

2893
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:10.450
<v Speaker 6>59 El Camino.</v>

2894
01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:11.373
<v Speaker 6>Ooh.</v>

2895
01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:15.490
<v Speaker 6>I haven't found the right situation when I've come across them and people would</v>

2896
01:24:15.491 --> 01:24:16.570
<v Speaker 6>want too much for him.</v>

2897
01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.370
<v Speaker 6>It'd be in like Iowa.</v>

2898
01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:19.383
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2899
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:20.560
<v Speaker 6>That's a beautiful car.</v>

2900
01:24:20.770 --> 01:24:21.401
<v Speaker 6>It's another car.</v>

2901
01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:22.570
<v Speaker 6>It's a Goddamn you're,</v>

2902
01:24:22.571 --> 01:24:24.460
<v Speaker 6>you're in a different time when you're in that car.</v>

2903
01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:27.970
<v Speaker 6>The first El Camino skirts on the back wheels.</v>

2904
01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:28.833
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

2905
01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:29.261
<v Speaker 6>I'd do it.</v>

2906
01:24:29.261 --> 01:24:31.910
<v Speaker 6>Kind of like 1500 is a good year or two.</v>

2907
01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:32.950
<v Speaker 6>But interesting year,</v>

2908
01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:34.001
<v Speaker 6>you know those,</v>

2909
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:36.070
<v Speaker 6>those cars of the early fifties or the,</v>

2910
01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:38.780
<v Speaker 6>the late fifties and early sixties so I didn't,</v>

2911
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:40.180
<v Speaker 6>amazing times man.</v>

2912
01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.560
<v Speaker 6>Like the old Barracuda,</v>

2913
01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.030
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't have the best shape in the world,</v>

2914
01:24:43.031 --> 01:24:43.331
<v Speaker 6>but man,</v>

2915
01:24:43.331 --> 01:24:46.330
<v Speaker 6>it's got a weird shape representative of a strange time,</v>

2916
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:47.200
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2917
01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:49.240
<v Speaker 6>in 1968 big ass.</v>

2918
01:24:49.241 --> 01:24:50.680
<v Speaker 6>Huge fucking muscle cars.</v>

2919
01:24:50.730 --> 01:24:51.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2920
01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.370
<v Speaker 6>Slide all over the place with shitty steering.</v>

2921
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.390
<v Speaker 6>Like your car.</v>

2922
01:24:55.570 --> 01:24:59.260
<v Speaker 6>That car is like intimately connected to every move.</v>

2923
01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:00.520
<v Speaker 6>The steering wheel.</v>

2924
01:25:00.521 --> 01:25:01.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2925
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:05.410
<v Speaker 6>And it's bought it or I went and picked up my homie and we were just going</v>

2926
01:25:05.411 --> 01:25:07.240
<v Speaker 6>around like the residential neighborhood and I was like,</v>

2927
01:25:07.241 --> 01:25:07.721
<v Speaker 6>watch this.</v>

2928
01:25:07.721 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 6>And I was doing like 50 and just dead made a right.</v>

2929
01:25:12.430 --> 01:25:12.970
<v Speaker 6>And there's,</v>

2930
01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:13.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2931
01:25:13.190 --> 01:25:16.120
<v Speaker 6>there's a button you press on there like where the shocks fill up with fluid.</v>

2932
01:25:16.410 --> 01:25:17.650
<v Speaker 6>So yeah,</v>

2933
01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:18.843
<v Speaker 6>it's just,</v>

2934
01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:20.800
<v Speaker 6>it's crazy man.</v>

2935
01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:21.260
<v Speaker 6>Well let's see.</v>

2936
01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:21.521
<v Speaker 6>Got a,</v>

2937
01:25:21.521 --> 01:25:22.900
<v Speaker 6>an almost perfect 50,</v>

2938
01:25:22.901 --> 01:25:25.240
<v Speaker 6>50 weight balance cause that's a mid engine car.</v>

2939
01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:27.910
<v Speaker 6>That means the engine is behind you and your seat.</v>

2940
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:30.220
<v Speaker 6>It was a brilliant piece of engineering,</v>

2941
01:25:30.221 --> 01:25:30.520
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2942
01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.350
<v Speaker 6>I was told it's the poor man's Lamborghini.</v>

2943
01:25:32.890 --> 01:25:33.310
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2944
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.911
<v Speaker 6>that's silly.</v>

2945
01:25:33.911 --> 01:25:34.780
<v Speaker 6>It's a better car.</v>

2946
01:25:34.781 --> 01:25:35.261
<v Speaker 6>It's more,</v>

2947
01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:36.400
<v Speaker 6>it's better looking.</v>

2948
01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:40.480
<v Speaker 6>Lamborghini looks like you're on coke if you drive it around a Lamborghini.</v>

2949
01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.501
<v Speaker 6>Honestly,</v>

2950
01:25:41.501 --> 01:25:42.334
<v Speaker 6>between you and me,</v>

2951
01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.080
<v Speaker 6>like I couldn't spend,</v>

2952
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:45.880
<v Speaker 6>when I went to buy that car,</v>

2953
01:25:45.881 --> 01:25:49.480
<v Speaker 6>I went to a spot here in Pasadena where there's a bunch of car dealerships,</v>

2954
01:25:49.481 --> 01:25:49.631
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2955
01:25:49.631 --> 01:25:50.620
<v Speaker 6>high end portion,</v>

2956
01:25:50.770 --> 01:25:51.371
<v Speaker 6>all this stuff.</v>

2957
01:25:51.371 --> 01:25:55.120
<v Speaker 6>And I went there and I went looking for an eight,</v>

2958
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:56.830
<v Speaker 6>actually just a sedan cause I was,</v>

2959
01:25:56.940 --> 01:25:57.820
<v Speaker 6>it's another beautiful,</v>

2960
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:58.630
<v Speaker 6>I've been driving.</v>

2961
01:25:58.630 --> 01:25:58.900
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2962
01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:00.790
<v Speaker 6>basically Sam series beamers for years.</v>

2963
01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:01.181
<v Speaker 6>Like I was,</v>

2964
01:26:01.181 --> 01:26:01.361
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2965
01:26:01.361 --> 01:26:03.620
<v Speaker 6>and I just wanted to switch it up and I heard that was the same</v>

2966
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:05.810
<v Speaker 3>or similar and then the class and I was a,</v>

2967
01:26:05.811 --> 01:26:08.120
<v Speaker 3>so I went and saw it and the salesman told me,</v>

2968
01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:08.960
<v Speaker 3>don't you don't,</v>

2969
01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:10.750
<v Speaker 3>I told him why I like beamers and oil.</v>

2970
01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:12.200
<v Speaker 3>I've been driving them for so long and he was like,</v>

2971
01:26:12.201 --> 01:26:13.760
<v Speaker 3>you don't want this car once he,</v>

2972
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:14.570
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2973
01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:16.190
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly what I said to him.</v>

2974
01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:16.881
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2975
01:26:16.881 --> 01:26:17.271
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

2976
01:26:17.271 --> 01:26:17.541
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

2977
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:17.721
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

2981
01:26:20.090 --> 01:26:20.721
<v Speaker 3>And then I realized,</v>

2982
01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:22.970
<v Speaker 3>I think he knows who I am and he's like,</v>

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.570
<v Speaker 3>there was a Bentley dealership right there.</v>

3007
01:26:38.571 --> 01:26:41.340
<v Speaker 3>And I went in there and saw that Bentley coupe and it was like this thing,</v>

3008
01:26:41.341 --> 01:26:42.830
<v Speaker 3>it was $250,000.</v>

3009
01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:43.461
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3010
01:26:43.461 --> 01:26:45.050
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a jerk off in this car.</v>

3011
01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:45.560
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3012
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.393
<v Speaker 3>I mean like driving,</v>

3013
01:26:46.530 --> 01:26:46.850
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

3014
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:48.140
<v Speaker 3>I'd feel like an extreme jerk.</v>

3015
01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.440
<v Speaker 3>And I went into the Jag and they'll,</v>

3016
01:26:51.441 --> 01:26:52.790
<v Speaker 3>new jag wasn't out yet.</v>

3017
01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:54.560
<v Speaker 3>Like I might at that Jag would have been out,</v>

3018
01:26:54.561 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 3>I might have bought,</v>

3019
01:26:55.100 --> 01:26:56.720
<v Speaker 3>I might've got that just because I was like,</v>

3020
01:26:56.721 --> 01:26:56.930
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3021
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:57.201
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3022
01:26:57.201 --> 01:26:58.640
<v Speaker 3>and I was just in one of the car that day.</v>

3023
01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:00.103
<v Speaker 3>I had a truck,</v>

3024
01:27:00.170 --> 01:27:02.240
<v Speaker 3>I got to think I've got to have a car in a truck.</v>

3025
01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:03.730
<v Speaker 3>That's my thing.</v>

3026
01:27:03.730 --> 01:27:04.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3027
01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:05.450
<v Speaker 3>there was sometimes more than that,</v>

3028
01:27:05.451 --> 01:27:06.740
<v Speaker 3>but I got to have a car in a truck.</v>

3029
01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.800
<v Speaker 3>So we'll first world problems,</v>

3030
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.701
<v Speaker 3>first world problems.</v>

3031
01:27:10.701 --> 01:27:11.534
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3032
01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:12.951
<v Speaker 3>So then I,</v>

3033
01:27:12.951 --> 01:27:13.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3034
01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:13.671
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that.</v>

3035
01:27:13.671 --> 01:27:15.530
<v Speaker 3>So I'm walking back to get to my car where I parked,</v>

3036
01:27:15.531 --> 01:27:19.070
<v Speaker 3>I have to go back through the Audi showroom and then I see the r eight and the</v>

3037
01:27:19.071 --> 01:27:20.120
<v Speaker 3>corner and it's white.</v>

3038
01:27:20.121 --> 01:27:21.400
<v Speaker 3>And I go there and looking at them and reading.</v>

3039
01:27:21.410 --> 01:27:22.670
<v Speaker 3>The guy in the kid comes over and he's like,</v>

3040
01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:22.911

01:27:22.911 --> 01:27:23.631
<v Speaker 3>this is bad ass.</v>

3042
01:27:23.631 --> 01:27:23.891
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

01:27:23.891 --> 01:27:24.340
<v Speaker 3>gas stove.</v>

3044
01:27:24.340 --> 01:27:26.040
<v Speaker 3>He starts talking to me about it and I'm,</v>

3045
01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:26.781
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3048
01:27:28.820 --> 01:27:29.631
<v Speaker 3>in my brain saying,</v>

3049
01:27:29.631 --> 01:27:31.100
<v Speaker 3>I can't get this fucking car man.</v>

3050
01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:31.953
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3051
01:27:32.490 --> 01:27:33.323
<v Speaker 3>why are we thinking that?</v>

3052
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:34.190
<v Speaker 3>Just because it was like,</v>

3053
01:27:34.191 --> 01:27:35.430
<v Speaker 3>you know when them things like that's a win,</v>

3054
01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:35.991
<v Speaker 3>you know this,</v>

3055
01:27:35.991 --> 01:27:37.220
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't practical at all.</v>

3056
01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:38.510
<v Speaker 3>There was nothing practical about it.</v>

3057
01:27:38.511 --> 01:27:40.040
<v Speaker 3>There was no back seat for kids.</v>

3058
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:40.560
<v Speaker 3>There was no,</v>

3059
01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:41.300
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3060
01:27:41.300 --> 01:27:41.601
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3061
01:27:41.601 --> 01:27:42.411
<v Speaker 3>nobody's going for this.</v>

3062
01:27:42.411 --> 01:27:43.970
<v Speaker 3>My accountant's not going to go for this today.</v>

3063
01:27:43.971 --> 01:27:45.680
<v Speaker 3>They're going to break my balls over it.</v>

3064
01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:46.970
<v Speaker 3>But then I'm like,</v>

3065
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:47.151
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

3066
01:27:47.151 --> 01:27:47.631
<v Speaker 3>it was white.</v>

3067
01:27:47.631 --> 01:27:47.931
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

3068
01:27:47.931 --> 01:27:48.920
<v Speaker 3>I hate white cars,</v>

3069
01:27:48.921 --> 01:27:49.131
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3070
01:27:49.131 --> 01:27:49.964
<v Speaker 3>I hate him.</v>

3071
01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.613
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

3072
01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:54.630
<v Speaker 3>I got a black on black carbon fiber one in the bag.</v>

3073
01:27:55.010 --> 01:27:55.580
<v Speaker 3>And he was,</v>

3074
01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.260
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think he thought I was looking.</v>

3075
01:27:57.261 --> 01:27:57.711
<v Speaker 3>He was just like,</v>

3076
01:27:57.711 --> 01:27:58.280
<v Speaker 3>you want to see it?</v>

3077
01:27:58.280 --> 01:27:58.581
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3078
01:27:58.581 --> 01:27:58.851
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

3079
01:27:58.851 --> 01:28:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I'll come see it and I see it.</v>

3080
01:28:00.681 --> 01:28:01.420
<v Speaker 3>And it's you,</v>

3081
01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.900
<v Speaker 3>you'd see my car at the time of the day.</v>

3082
01:28:02.901 --> 01:28:03.171
<v Speaker 3>Was it?</v>

3083
01:28:03.171 --> 01:28:04.550
<v Speaker 3>When you saw like four,</v>

3084
01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.760
<v Speaker 3>oh that's even right up where the sun is just slowly starting to make its way</v>

3085
01:28:09.921 --> 01:28:10.281
<v Speaker 3>across.</v>

3086
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:14.360
<v Speaker 3>This carbon fiber was just popping in and out and I was like,</v>

3087
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:15.081
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

3088
01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:15.914
<v Speaker 3>if you could have</v>

3089
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:20.300
<v Speaker 3>the car looked like a sneaker to me and I'm a sneaker freak.</v>

3090
01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:20.810
<v Speaker 3>So I was like,</v>

3091
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:21.441
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

3092
01:28:21.441 --> 01:28:22.300
<v Speaker 3>that looks like it's just something,</v>

3093
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:24.620
<v Speaker 3>it reminded me of an Air Jordan somehow.</v>

3094
01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.940
<v Speaker 3>That's so hilarious.</v>

3095
01:28:25.941 --> 01:28:26.721
<v Speaker 3>And then so I'm like,</v>

3096
01:28:26.721 --> 01:28:27.554
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

3097
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.861
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3098
01:28:27.861 --> 01:28:28.800
<v Speaker 3>let me take it first payment.</v>

3099
01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:29.331
<v Speaker 3>And they were like,</v>

3100
01:28:29.331 --> 01:28:29.541
<v Speaker 3>Nah,</v>

3101
01:28:29.541 --> 01:28:30.111
<v Speaker 3>we don't do that.</v>

3102
01:28:30.111 --> 01:28:31.190
<v Speaker 3>We'll take you for a ride.</v>

3103
01:28:31.191 --> 01:28:33.830
<v Speaker 3>And he takes me out for some reason.</v>

3104
01:28:33.831 --> 01:28:34.970
<v Speaker 3>This is what they told me they were like,</v>

3105
01:28:34.971 --> 01:28:36.920
<v Speaker 3>unless they know that it's basically sold,</v>

3106

<v Speaker 3>the car.</v>

3111
01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:43.730
<v Speaker 3>What you should do,</v>

3112
01:28:43.730 --> 01:28:45.230
<v Speaker 3>just sit down in the purchase seat,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just let me throw this out in car and we'd go down and it's back there by the</v>

3119
01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Rose Bowl where it's all canyon and we get like three blocks from the</v>

3120
01:28:57.141 --> 01:28:57.501
<v Speaker 3>dealership.</v>

3121
01:28:57.501 --> 01:28:58.640
<v Speaker 3>He pulls over and he gets out and he's like,</v>

01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:23.580
<v Speaker 6>and then get outside of town and get,</v>

01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:38.311
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

3149
01:29:38.311 --> 01:29:38.580
<v Speaker 6>let me,</v>

3150
01:29:38.580 --> 01:29:41.100
<v Speaker 6>let me show the Wifi and I'm sure the WAC and he's going to be like,</v>

3151
01:29:41.101 --> 01:29:41.400
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

3152
01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:42.071
<v Speaker 6>what are you doing?</v>

3153
01:29:42.071 --> 01:29:43.230
<v Speaker 6>And the kids can't sit in that.</v>

3154
01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:44.243
<v Speaker 6>I text her,</v>

3155
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:48.030
<v Speaker 6>I think I'm going to buy this car and just sending a picture of it and I'm</v>

3156
01:29:48.031 --> 01:29:48.751
<v Speaker 6>waiting and I'm like,</v>

3157
01:29:48.751 --> 01:29:48.901
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

3158
01:29:48.901 --> 01:29:49.190
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

3159
01:29:49.190 --> 01:29:52.080
<v Speaker 6>Was somebody going to come talk sense to me right now not to buy this car?</v>

3160
01:29:52.081 --> 01:29:52.470
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3161
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.981
<v Speaker 6>I wasn't sure.</v>

3162
01:29:52.981 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 6>Is this a midlife crisis?</v>

3163
01:29:54.110 --> 01:29:56.160
<v Speaker 6>I was never really a big sports car guy was a big sign,</v>

3164
01:29:56.170 --> 01:29:57.270
<v Speaker 6>like a nice sedan,</v>

3165
01:29:57.271 --> 01:29:58.890
<v Speaker 6>like old man kind of thing,</v>

3166
01:29:58.891 --> 01:29:59.724
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>

3167
01:29:59.970 --> 01:30:01.580
<v Speaker 6>And then my wife sends back to the first Texas,</v>

3168
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:02.460
<v Speaker 6>you deserve it baby.</v>

3169
01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:04.393
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3170
01:30:04.810 --> 01:30:05.090
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>

3171
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.940
<v Speaker 6>I got to buy this color.</v>

3172
01:30:08.910 --> 01:30:10.410
<v Speaker 6>That's why I wound up with my toy.</v>

3173
01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:13.290
<v Speaker 6>Maybe been one of the most heartwarming podcast we've ever done.</v>

3174
01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:13.591
<v Speaker 6>Brian.</v>

3175
01:30:13.591 --> 01:30:17.910
<v Speaker 6>That's because of his heart inside your pussy tearing stories.</v>

3176
01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:19.261
<v Speaker 6>Besides that,</v>

3177
01:30:19.261 --> 01:30:22.030
<v Speaker 6>everything else is not how this,</v>

3178
01:30:22.090 --> 01:30:22.921
<v Speaker 6>this functioning.</v>

3179
01:30:22.921 --> 01:30:23.210
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

3180
01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:23.611
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3181
01:30:23.611 --> 01:30:25.590
<v Speaker 6>you can just call upon that whenever you want.</v>

3182
01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:26.700
<v Speaker 6>The boner pill works.</v>

3183
01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.260
<v Speaker 6>Having a card like that is like driving a ride.</v>

3184
01:30:31.290 --> 01:30:35.160
<v Speaker 6>You're in a ride every day and you don't even have to abuse the law like this.</v>

3185
01:30:35.161 --> 01:30:37.380
<v Speaker 6>People don't understand just turning corners at normal speed.</v>

3186
01:30:37.381 --> 01:30:38.580
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're so connected to it.</v>

3187
01:30:38.581 --> 01:30:41.410
<v Speaker 6>It's fun and you don't even have to be a nun on the freeway and you get nice is</v>

3188
01:30:41.430 --> 01:30:43.440
<v Speaker 6>a lot quicker because you can just dart in between.</v>

3189
01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:43.670
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>

3190
01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:45.960
<v Speaker 6>the control is so amazing on those cars.</v>

3191
01:30:45.961 --> 01:30:46.291
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

3192
01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:48.720
<v Speaker 6>You can do things that I would call other people assholes for.</v>

3193
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:51.270
<v Speaker 6>That's when we made engine four wheel drive car.</v>

3194
01:30:51.271 --> 01:30:52.650
<v Speaker 6>That's a crazy car man.</v>

3195
01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:53.670
<v Speaker 6>That's brilliant.</v>

3196
01:30:53.671 --> 01:30:57.000
<v Speaker 6>Piece of [inaudible] sport mode and put those shock absorbers,</v>

3197
01:30:57.001 --> 01:30:59.340
<v Speaker 6>fill him up with the fluid and that car is on rails.</v>

3198
01:30:59.341 --> 01:30:59.700
<v Speaker 6>Man.</v>

3199
01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.380
<v Speaker 6>That's said crazy thing about those old cars too,</v>

3200
01:31:01.381 --> 01:31:03.150
<v Speaker 6>is that they do a lot of adjusting for you.</v>

3201
01:31:03.151 --> 01:31:03.961
<v Speaker 6>If you fuck up,</v>

3202
01:31:03.961 --> 01:31:07.950
<v Speaker 6>like there's traction control that comes in and stability control and antilock</v>

3203
01:31:07.951 --> 01:31:08.780
<v Speaker 6>brakes,</v>

3204
01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:09.231
<v Speaker 6>like do it.</v>

3205
01:31:09.231 --> 01:31:10.890
<v Speaker 6>They do a lot of correcting for you,</v>

3206
01:31:10.891 --> 01:31:12.720
<v Speaker 6>like to make it much more safe to drive.</v>

3207
01:31:12.721 --> 01:31:14.490
<v Speaker 6>The cars were thinking driving.</v>

3208
01:31:14.740 --> 01:31:16.650
<v Speaker 6>But that's the thing that bothers me though.</v>

3209
01:31:16.651 --> 01:31:17.371
<v Speaker 6>I love that.</v>

3210
01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.500
<v Speaker 6>But the thing that bothers me is that you miss out on like,</v>

3211
01:31:19.501 --> 01:31:22.410
<v Speaker 6>there's like a feel when you drive in a steering wheel that doesn't have power</v>

3212
01:31:22.411 --> 01:31:23.580
<v Speaker 6>steering and you know,</v>

3213
01:31:23.581 --> 01:31:23.811
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

3214
01:31:23.811 --> 01:31:24.051
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

3215
01:31:24.051 --> 01:31:25.390
<v Speaker 6>you're hitting breaks that you,</v>

3216
01:31:25.391 --> 01:31:27.570
<v Speaker 6>you feel the brakes lock up.</v>

3217
01:31:27.630 --> 01:31:28.220
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3218
01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:30.420
<v Speaker 6>it's like you have a more of a connection to a car.</v>

3219
01:31:30.421 --> 01:31:31.350
<v Speaker 6>Those old cars,</v>

3220
01:31:31.890 --> 01:31:32.101
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3221
01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:32.910
<v Speaker 6>it's not good.</v>

3222
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:34.380
<v Speaker 6>It's terrible if you want to be safe.</v>

3223
01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.760
<v Speaker 6>But as far as like real,</v>

3224
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:36.703
<v Speaker 6>I like the Audi.</v>

3225
01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:40.260
<v Speaker 6>I like driving it and driving it fast because every once in a while,</v>

3226
01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:42.240
<v Speaker 6>even though it's that smooth and cool and everything,</v>

3227
01:31:42.241 --> 01:31:42.781
<v Speaker 6>you're so low,</v>

3228
01:31:42.781 --> 01:31:43.680
<v Speaker 6>you feel every bump.</v>

3229
01:31:44.370 --> 01:31:46.720
<v Speaker 6>And then also every once in a while you'd do something wild enough to,</v>

3230
01:31:46.721 --> 01:31:48.750
<v Speaker 6>it makes you realize you gotta be scared a little bit.</v>

3231
01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:50.101
<v Speaker 6>Women,</v>

3232
01:31:50.101 --> 01:31:51.150
<v Speaker 6>women will never understand.</v>

3233
01:31:51.151 --> 01:31:55.590
<v Speaker 6>And dudes who have never driven cars like that would never understand either.</v>

3234
01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:57.180
<v Speaker 6>That's one of those things you talk to people in,</v>

3235
01:31:57.181 --> 01:31:57.361
<v Speaker 6>they're like,</v>

3236
01:31:57.361 --> 01:31:59.200
<v Speaker 6>I don't give a fuck about cars man.</v>

3237
01:31:59.201 --> 01:31:59.801
<v Speaker 6>You say that,</v>

3238
01:31:59.801 --> 01:32:01.210
<v Speaker 6>but I don't even understand what you're saying.</v>

3239
01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:05.320
<v Speaker 6>Like you either haven't driven one of those fucking things or you don't.</v>

3240
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:06.970
<v Speaker 6>You can't afford it so you don't even want to fuck with it.</v>

3241
01:32:06.971 --> 01:32:08.500
<v Speaker 6>Which I understood only ridden in them.</v>

3242
01:32:08.501 --> 01:32:09.191
<v Speaker 6>They've never done it.</v>

3243
01:32:09.191 --> 01:32:09.400
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3244
01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.560
<v Speaker 6>they've never drove a car.</v>

3245
01:32:11.630 --> 01:32:11.800
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

3246
01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:12.940
<v Speaker 6>If somebody just came up to you and said,</v>

3247
01:32:12.941 --> 01:32:13.481
<v Speaker 6>do you want this?</v>

3248
01:32:13.481 --> 01:32:13.871
<v Speaker 6>You'd be like,</v>

3249
01:32:13.871 --> 01:32:14.500
<v Speaker 6>fuck yeah,</v>

3250
01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.610
<v Speaker 6>and then you drive anything like,</v>

3251
01:32:15.611 --> 01:32:16.001
<v Speaker 6>Oh man,</v>

3252
01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:16.834
<v Speaker 6>this thing is awesome.</v>

3253
01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:17.673
<v Speaker 6>You would get it then.</v>

3254
01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:19.900
<v Speaker 6>But this first world problems,</v>

3255
01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:20.833
<v Speaker 6>she didn't drive this.</v>

3256
01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:21.820
<v Speaker 6>He knew.</v>

3257
01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:25.870
<v Speaker 6>He knew the minute I put my foot on that thing and so the corner I was going to</v>

3258
01:32:25.871 --> 01:32:26.170
<v Speaker 6>be like,</v>

3259
01:32:26.170 --> 01:32:26.590
<v Speaker 6>I'm going,</v>

3260
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:27.790
<v Speaker 6>this is cars going home with me.</v>

3261
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:28.540
<v Speaker 6>If anything is,</v>

3262
01:32:28.540 --> 01:32:30.370
<v Speaker 6>I remember a guy came up and was like,</v>

3263
01:32:30.371 --> 01:32:30.971
<v Speaker 6>I want to look at this.</v>

3264
01:32:30.971 --> 01:32:31.271
<v Speaker 6>I was like,</v>

3265
01:32:31.271 --> 01:32:32.110
<v Speaker 6>get away from my car.</v>

3266
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:33.850
<v Speaker 6>I like before the paperwork.</v>

3267
01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:34.710
<v Speaker 6>That's funny.</v>

3268
01:32:34.710 --> 01:32:35.590
<v Speaker 6>We get away from my car,</v>

3269
01:32:35.591 --> 01:32:35.830
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

3270
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:36.663
<v Speaker 6>that's my car.</v>

3271
01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:43.370
<v Speaker 6>He's sitting in it and farting and I wasn't having none of that can't be,</v>

3272
01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:44.201
<v Speaker 6>that's a,</v>

3273
01:32:44.201 --> 01:32:46.360
<v Speaker 6>that's an impulse buy that you could pull off.</v>

3274
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:47.620
<v Speaker 6>You've got damn Everlast.</v>

3275
01:32:47.710 --> 01:32:50.410
<v Speaker 6>But if you're a dude who's living in an apartment and you drive one of those</v>

3276
01:32:50.411 --> 01:32:50.621
<v Speaker 6>things,</v>

3277
01:32:50.621 --> 01:32:51.160
<v Speaker 6>you're an asshole.</v>

3278
01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:51.993
<v Speaker 6>Had a good look.</v>

3279
01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:53.950
<v Speaker 6>You gotta be real careful about things like that.</v>

3280
01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:56.050
<v Speaker 6>Cause he's just like financing.</v>

3281
01:32:56.051 --> 01:32:57.760
<v Speaker 6>It just makes it so tempting.</v>

3282
01:32:57.761 --> 01:32:59.290
<v Speaker 6>It's almost doable.</v>

3283
01:32:59.291 --> 01:33:02.620
<v Speaker 6>If I just work a couple extra shifts washing,</v>

3284
01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:06.040
<v Speaker 6>washing dishes or whatever the fuck I'm going to do and slinging drinks,</v>

3285
01:33:06.100 --> 01:33:07.890
<v Speaker 6>I can just maybe get that corvette.</v>

3286
01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:11.800
<v Speaker 6>It was 150 and it was still like Ooh yeah,</v>

3287
01:33:12.270 --> 01:33:13.103

3348
01:34:32.981 --> 01:34:35.430
<v Speaker 6>I believe it's important to be a little self indulgent debate.</v>

3349
01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:38.820
<v Speaker 6>I was told by a good friend when I first like kind of made it like,</v>

3350
01:34:38.830 --> 01:34:39.940
<v Speaker 6>and I was stressed about this,</v>

3351
01:34:39.941 --> 01:34:42.610
<v Speaker 6>that and the other and like every once in a while go out and buy yourself</v>

3352
01:34:42.611 --> 01:34:43.150
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

3353
01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:45.820
<v Speaker 6>whether it's a pair of sneakers or something,</v>

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.800
<v Speaker 6>This is a certain amount of management you have to do.</v>

3357
01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:50.531
<v Speaker 6>Your impulse was,</v>

3358
01:34:50.531 --> 01:34:53.920
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's important to be impulsive on a certain level is important to</v>

3359
01:34:53.921 --> 01:34:55.420
<v Speaker 6>just go with your instincts on shit,</v>

3428
01:36:46.810 --> 01:36:50.170
<v Speaker 1>This sounds like a movie in the 1980s and you would wind up sleeping with her</v>

3429
01:36:50.171 --> 01:36:53.080
<v Speaker 1>that night and then she would regret it because you were in a band and you were</v>

3430
01:36:53.081 --> 01:36:53.651
<v Speaker 1>in a Boston.</v>

3431
01:36:53.651 --> 01:36:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3432
01:36:53.770 --> 01:36:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Runs right into throwing hundreds of her face.</v>

3433
01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:00.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3434
01:37:00.441 --> 01:37:00.681
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3435
01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I've bought,</v>

3436
01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:02.570
<v Speaker 1>bought a bar before,</v>

3437
01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:04.070
<v Speaker 1>but the whole bar around the drinks,</v>

3438
01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:04.901
<v Speaker 1>I used to kick everybody.</v>

3439
01:37:04.901 --> 01:37:06.500
<v Speaker 1>When I kick anybody out of the comedy store,</v>

3440
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:07.970
<v Speaker 1>I'd buy the whole audience around the tracks.</v>

3441
01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I S oh,</v>

3442
01:37:09.050 --> 01:37:11.900
<v Speaker 1>they still love doing that because the comedy store never had any,</v>

3443
01:37:11.901 --> 01:37:12.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3444
01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:13.670
<v Speaker 1>there's no one watches the crowd.</v>

3445
01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Like if you go to a legitimate comedy club and people start mouth and off,</v>

3446
01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:19.010
<v Speaker 1>the security guy will come over and tell him,</v>

3447
01:37:19.011 --> 01:37:19.131
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3448
01:37:19.131 --> 01:37:20.840
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to leave you disrupting the performance.</v>

3449
01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:21.771
<v Speaker 1>The company store,</v>

3450
01:37:21.771 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 1>there's no security.</v>

3451
01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:23.960
<v Speaker 3>I used to go there all the time.</v>

3452
01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:26.570
<v Speaker 3>The dog on Monday nights.</v>

3453
01:37:26.571 --> 01:37:27.980
<v Speaker 3>We used to go there and just get nuts,</v>

3454
01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:28.551
<v Speaker 3>but yeah.</v>

3455
01:37:28.551 --> 01:37:30.050
<v Speaker 3>Well what is the open,</v>

3456
01:37:30.051 --> 01:37:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Mike night is a Sunday.</v>

3457
01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:31.340
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3458
01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.120
<v Speaker 3>Sunday and Monday.</v>

3459
01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.020
<v Speaker 3>Sunday and Monday.</v>

3460
01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:33.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3461
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3462
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:36.920
<v Speaker 3>There was a night where it was like if you went in there,</v>

3463
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:38.960
<v Speaker 3>you'd see a bunch of shit comics,</v>

3464
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:41.900
<v Speaker 3>but you are guaranteed almost that some large cat.</v>

3465
01:37:41.901 --> 01:37:43.460
<v Speaker 3>We'd walk in and do something like,</v>

3466
01:37:43.461 --> 01:37:44.690
<v Speaker 3>it was like Monday I was at like a tree.</v>

3467
01:37:44.691 --> 01:37:45.170
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

3468

3470
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:50.330
<v Speaker 3>I think it's still probably like that.</v>

3471
01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:53.630
<v Speaker 3>Murphy might pop in and do a set or you know,</v>

3472
01:37:53.631 --> 01:37:55.240
<v Speaker 3>last week I was Mike Tyson.</v>

3479
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:05.580
<v Speaker 6>I want to see somebody heckle a,</v>

<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

3542
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:39.720
<v Speaker 6>As much as they get paid to do that shit.</v>

3543
01:39:39.721 --> 01:39:41.180
<v Speaker 6>There was a time when they weren't right.</v>

3544
01:39:41.190 --> 01:39:42.870
<v Speaker 6>I think one of the first things either Bam,</v>

3545
01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:43.770
<v Speaker 6>I think it was Knoxville,</v>

3546
01:39:43.771 --> 01:39:46.140
<v Speaker 6>didn't he shoot himself with a 44 magnum,</v>

3547
01:39:46.170 --> 01:39:48.660
<v Speaker 6>we put a belt bulletproof vest on and somebody shoot him,</v>

3548
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:51.091
<v Speaker 6>shoot him.</v>

3549
01:39:51.091 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 6>So he,</v>

3550
01:39:51.390 --> 01:39:52.480
<v Speaker 6>I think he wound up doing it.</v>

3551
01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:55.130
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty sure like,</v>

3552
01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:59.420
<v Speaker 6>and that was for like Rainer nit mag when the Internet wasn't anything.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It must be nuts.</v>

3559
01:40:10.861 --> 01:40:13.940
<v Speaker 6>And why I would think it should be a more explored topic is uh,</v>

3560
01:40:14.720 --> 01:40:15.300

01:40:26.971 --> 01:40:28.320
<v Speaker 6>That's a hard way to pay your bills.</v>

01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:30.420
<v Speaker 6>You let it can be about the money.</v>

3570
01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:31.590
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3571
01:40:31.590 --> 01:40:32.460
<v Speaker 6>it can't be about the money.</v>

3572
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:34.380
<v Speaker 6>It's gotta be about the money and the thrill.</v>

3573
01:40:34.530 --> 01:40:35.190
<v Speaker 6>The bull.</v>

3574
01:40:35.190 --> 01:40:35.911
<v Speaker 6>That's unless,</v>

3575
01:40:35.911 --> 01:40:36.691
<v Speaker 6>I mean you're not,</v>

3576
01:40:36.691 --> 01:40:38.730
<v Speaker 6>so people were saying about this tornado thing,</v>

3577
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3578
01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:41.010
<v Speaker 6>sometimes people,</v>

3579
01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.260
<v Speaker 6>they say stupid shit when it comes to,</v>

3580
01:40:43.261 --> 01:40:43.680
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3581
01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:45.720
<v Speaker 6>why do people live in these tornado areas?</v>

3582
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:46.860
<v Speaker 6>They can't fucking leave.</v>

3583
01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:47.760
<v Speaker 6>They don't have any money.</v>

3584
01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:48.301
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3585
01:40:48.301 --> 01:40:50.350
<v Speaker 6>people are born and really pouring and lived there.</v>

3586
01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:50.820
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3587
01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:52.020
<v Speaker 6>They barely get by.</v>

3588
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:53.350
<v Speaker 6>And for the most part,</v>

3589
01:40:53.351 --> 01:40:54.460
<v Speaker 6>everyone they know is there.</v>

3590
01:40:54.461 --> 01:40:56.110
<v Speaker 6>Like it ain't that easy to just move.</v>

3591
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:57.363
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

3592
01:40:57.380 --> 01:40:59.440
<v Speaker 6>but it costs fucking money,</v>

3593
01:40:59.441 --> 01:40:59.890
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3594
01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:00.970
<v Speaker 6>And a lot of people,</v>

3595
01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:03.880
<v Speaker 6>once you get a job when the big one hits here and it's like,</v>

3596
01:41:03.881 --> 01:41:04.160
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

3597
01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.580
<v Speaker 6>how could you live there knowing that was going to eventually come.</v>

3598
01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:07.271
<v Speaker 6>But my point is,</v>

3599
01:41:07.271 --> 01:41:08.710
<v Speaker 6>once you've got a job as a rodeo clown,</v>

3600
01:41:08.711 --> 01:41:09.910
<v Speaker 6>that's how you pay your fucking bills.</v>

3601
01:41:09.940 --> 01:41:11.410
<v Speaker 6>That's how you pay your fucking bills,</v>

3602
01:41:11.411 --> 01:41:11.651
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

3603
01:41:11.651 --> 01:41:14.290
<v Speaker 6>It's hard to jump off that Rodeo clown thing.</v>

3604
01:41:14.291 --> 01:41:14.920
<v Speaker 6>Where are you getting,</v>

3605
01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:15.161
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3606
01:41:15.161 --> 01:41:17.410
<v Speaker 6>1500 a week or whatever the fuck those guys are getting.</v>

3607
01:41:17.411 --> 01:41:20.650
<v Speaker 6>And then tried to get a job where you get 400 a week and then you miss that</v>

3608
01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.000
<v Speaker 6>other 900 bucks.</v>

3609
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.863
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely.</v>

3610
01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:23.470
<v Speaker 6>In the yard.</v>

3611
01:41:23.470 --> 01:41:24.303
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

3612
01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:24.791

3629
01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:45.400

<v Speaker 6>He was out in the woods who's out in the woods of Pennsylvania.</v>

3632
01:41:49.300 --> 01:41:50.200
<v Speaker 6>Crazy Fox.</v>

3633
01:41:50.530 --> 01:41:51.101
<v Speaker 6>If you,</v>

3634
01:41:51.101 --> 01:41:51.530
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

3635
01:41:51.530 --> 01:41:52.361
<v Speaker 6>you really think about it,</v>

3636
01:41:52.361 --> 01:41:52.991
<v Speaker 6>it's amazing.</v>

3637
01:41:52.991 --> 01:41:56.530
<v Speaker 6>There's not more crashes because alcohol's everywhere and people are driving</v>

3638
01:41:56.531 --> 01:41:57.150
<v Speaker 6>everywhere.</v>

3639
01:41:57.150 --> 01:41:57.990
<v Speaker 6>It's amazing.</v>

3640
01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.760
<v Speaker 6>Something like on real sports or something like that where they like went and</v>

3641
01:42:00.761 --> 01:42:05.380
<v Speaker 6>like really filmed and checked out a football game and like how fucked up they</v>

3642
01:42:05.381 --> 01:42:07.030
<v Speaker 6>are before and after going like that.</v>

3643
01:42:07.031 --> 01:42:08.260
<v Speaker 6>The cops don't really do much.</v>

3644
01:42:08.261 --> 01:42:09.220
<v Speaker 6>They just let all these people,</v>

3645
01:42:09.221 --> 01:42:13.690
<v Speaker 6>like thousands of people leave those football games inebriated driving their</v>

3646
01:42:13.691 --> 01:42:14.080
<v Speaker 6>cars.</v>

3647
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:15.010
<v Speaker 6>That's a great point.</v>

3648
01:42:15.370 --> 01:42:17.140
<v Speaker 6>I never even thought about that because how many,</v>

3649
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:17.591
<v Speaker 6>what is it,</v>

3652
01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:25.270
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3653
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:26.320
<v Speaker 6>my God.</v>

01:42:27.641 --> 01:42:28.271
<v Speaker 6>And those people are,</v>

3657
01:42:28.271 --> 01:42:29.870
<v Speaker 6>you usually have drugs on top of that,</v>

3658
01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.260
<v Speaker 6>like acid football in particular.</v>

3659
01:42:32.261 --> 01:42:33.520
<v Speaker 6>We didn't say baseball.</v>

3660
01:42:33.521 --> 01:42:34.870
<v Speaker 6>If you go to the dodger stadium,</v>

3661
01:42:34.871 --> 01:42:36.520
<v Speaker 6>there's not people fucking in the parking lot.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

3664
01:42:38.260 --> 01:42:41.950
<v Speaker 6>Barbecuing and having four cases of beer sitting outside their RV.</v>

3692
01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:11.140
<v Speaker 6>That's what I say in my book.</v>

01:43:11.141 --> 01:43:11.974
<v Speaker 6>He's do pay their tax.</v>

3694
01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.470
<v Speaker 6>Why do you a Saint Barts?</v>

3695
01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:15.413
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3696
01:43:15.560 --> 01:43:16.680
<v Speaker 6>it's something like that.</v>

3697
01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:18.550
<v Speaker 6>That's a lot of those dudes that were,</v>

3698
01:43:18.551 --> 01:43:18.821
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3699
01:43:18.821 --> 01:43:22.840
<v Speaker 6>they're just starting to allow poker again in the United States Internet poker.</v>

3700
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:26.380
<v Speaker 6>They're doing it in Nevada and the way it works is you have to be in Nevada.</v>

3701
01:43:26.381 --> 01:43:27.070
<v Speaker 6>When you,</v>

3702
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:30.880
<v Speaker 6>when you get online they have to do it and actually gamble from Nevada.</v>

3703
01:43:30.881 --> 01:43:32.290
<v Speaker 6>But as long as you do it from Nevada,</v>

3704
01:43:32.291 --> 01:43:33.124
<v Speaker 6>it's legal,</v>

3705
01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.360
<v Speaker 6>which is a strange thing,</v>

3706
01:43:34.361 --> 01:43:36.380
<v Speaker 6>but you can play poker.</v>

3707
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.180
<v Speaker 6>Hundreds of poker sites I hear about or they're just free sites now.</v>

3708
01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:42.640
<v Speaker 6>Well they're either free sites or they're illegal sites and they were fine for</v>

3709
01:43:42.641 --> 01:43:42.980
<v Speaker 6>why,</v>

3710
01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:44.260
<v Speaker 6>how could you be illegal and be like,</v>

3711
01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:44.770
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3712
01:43:44.770 --> 01:43:48.370
<v Speaker 6>cause I would have heard of are all over the television and stuff like that.</v>

3713
01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:48.641
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3714
01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:49.720
<v Speaker 6>those are the free ones.</v>

3715
01:43:49.721 --> 01:43:50.050
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3716
01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:52.220
<v Speaker 6>But some of those guys got trouble for doing illegal shit</v>

3717
01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:52.461
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3718
01:43:52.461 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 1>There was some famous ones that got in trouble,</v>

3719
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.470
<v Speaker 1>but the majority of the people who were involved in it,</v>

3720
01:43:57.471 --> 01:43:59.300
<v Speaker 1>when it was making billions of dollars,</v>

3721
01:43:59.510 --> 01:44:03.260
<v Speaker 1>they had to flee and they all had to go to like the Canary Islands and Shit and</v>

3722
01:44:03.261 --> 01:44:04.490
<v Speaker 1>the Cayman's and yeah,</v>

3723
01:44:04.491 --> 01:44:04.701
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3724
01:44:04.701 --> 01:44:05.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3725
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3726
01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:06.773
<v Speaker 1>what's that one?</v>

3727
01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Not believes but a Costa Rica.</v>

3728
01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica is a lot of them in Costa Rica too.</v>

3729
01:44:12.520 --> 01:44:13.400
<v Speaker 1>And these poor guys,</v>

3730
01:44:13.401 --> 01:44:13.640
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

3731
01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're essentially,</v>

3732
01:44:15.110 --> 01:44:15.980
<v Speaker 1>they got the,</v>

3733
01:44:15.981 --> 01:44:17.780
<v Speaker 1>they took their business away with law.</v>

3734
01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.320
<v Speaker 1>People were spending money and people were gambling and doing what they're</v>

3735
01:44:21.321 --> 01:44:22.011
<v Speaker 1>wanting to do with their money.</v>

3736
01:44:22.011 --> 01:44:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And these guys were collecting millions.</v>

3737
01:44:24.171 --> 01:44:25.310
<v Speaker 1>They're making millions a day.</v>

3738
01:44:25.780 --> 01:44:29.000
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden they came around with a new law that said,</v>

3739
01:44:29.001 --> 01:44:30.500
<v Speaker 1>you know what pitches we're not,</v>

3740
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:32.390
<v Speaker 1>we're not happy with you guys getting rich that easy.</v>

3741
01:44:32.690 --> 01:44:34.460
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

3742
01:44:34.461 --> 01:44:34.661
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

3743
01:44:34.661 --> 01:44:35.990
<v Speaker 1>you've leached the profits.</v>

3744
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:37.490
<v Speaker 1>They essentially stop progress.</v>

3745
01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:39.620
<v Speaker 1>They stopped the ability to gamble on the Internet.</v>

3746
01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's a sort of a weird form of progress,</v>

3747
01:44:42.081 --> 01:44:43.730
<v Speaker 1>it's still progress in a freedom sets.</v>

3748
01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:45.080
<v Speaker 1>It allows you to do with your money,</v>

3749
01:44:45.081 --> 01:44:46.580
<v Speaker 1>things that were unavailable before,</v>

3750
01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:48.740
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you want to gambling to be legal.</v>

3751
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:50.870
<v Speaker 1>I want you to be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>

3752
01:44:50.871 --> 01:44:53.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have any control of your life cause I don't want you to have any</v>

3753
01:44:53.151 --> 01:44:53.984
<v Speaker 1>control of her mind.</v>

3754
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:55.670
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as we allow people to come in and say,</v>

3755
01:44:55.671 --> 01:44:57.350
<v Speaker 1>you can't gamble on the Internet,</v>

3756
01:44:57.351 --> 01:44:59.810
<v Speaker 1>like why do you fucking talking about like,</v>

3757
01:44:59.811 --> 01:45:00.001
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

3758
01:45:00.001 --> 01:45:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Why would you tell me what I can do with my 20 bucks?</v>

3759
01:45:02.150 --> 01:45:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Why do you give a fuck?</v>

3760
01:45:03.081 --> 01:45:04.460
<v Speaker 1>Why is this even a conversation?</v>

3761
01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:07.520
<v Speaker 1>If you need to get some taxes out of that sanction gambling,</v>

3762
01:45:07.521 --> 01:45:09.080
<v Speaker 1>like the lottery should be sanctioned.</v>

3763
01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:10.000
<v Speaker 1>It should be sanctioned.</v>

3764
01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.150
<v Speaker 1>It should all be taxable.</v>

3765
01:45:11.180 --> 01:45:11.811
<v Speaker 1>But that's the point.</v>

3766
01:45:11.811 --> 01:45:12.081
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3767
01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:12.560
<v Speaker 1>they needed that.</v>

3768
01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.970
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing now.</v>

3769
01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:15.081
<v Speaker 1>They're opening it up.</v>

3770
01:45:15.081 --> 01:45:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they're getting there.</v>

3771
01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:17.330
<v Speaker 1>They're rake of that.</v>

3772
01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:17.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3773
01:45:17.781 --> 01:45:20.690
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure the local casinos probably weren't very happy with it either.</v>

3774
01:45:20.691 --> 01:45:21.031
<v Speaker 1>You know the,</v>

3775
01:45:21.031 --> 01:45:22.880
<v Speaker 1>the card casinos that were making a lot of money,</v>

3776
01:45:22.881 --> 01:45:24.170
<v Speaker 1>having people come in and play poker,</v>

3777
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:27.140
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden you can be naked playing poker at home.</v>

3778
01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:30.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple right down here like bell gardens and a few places.</v>

3779
01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:32.630
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure those people must have lost money.</v>

3780
01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And there's a,</v>

3781
01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:37.010
<v Speaker 1>there has to be some reasons why they would limit your freedom to gamble.</v>

3782
01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:38.630
<v Speaker 1>But the ultimately crazy thing,</v>

3783
01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:40.940
<v Speaker 1>it's just free to login of poker in the last,</v>

3784
01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.650
<v Speaker 1>let's say eight to 10 years.</v>

3785
01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:43.613
<v Speaker 1>It's TV,</v>

3786
01:45:43.940 --> 01:45:44.301
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>

3787
01:45:44.301 --> 01:45:46.940
<v Speaker 1>rope people in an amazing,</v>

3788
01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:48.143
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>

3789
01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.250
<v Speaker 1>It's just makes me crazy.</v>

3790
01:45:49.251 --> 01:45:51.440
<v Speaker 1>Then it's also TV combined with the the,</v>

3791
01:45:51.710 --> 01:45:53.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the new American dream.</v>

3792
01:45:53.121 --> 01:45:53.690
<v Speaker 1>That quick,</v>

3793
01:45:53.690 --> 01:45:54.111
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

3794
01:45:54.111 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3795
01:45:54.710 --> 01:45:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Not only buck,</v>

3796
01:45:55.581 --> 01:45:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but you're super famous.</v>

3797
01:45:56.991 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Then you win the world series of poker and you're the fucking man.</v>

3798
01:45:59.871 --> 01:46:03.350
<v Speaker 1>You know Mike Goldberg just interviewed some dude on the last UFC and he was,</v>

3799
01:46:03.530 --> 01:46:07.340
<v Speaker 1>he won $18 million in a poker tournament.</v>

3800
01:46:07.710 --> 01:46:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Cheese and you're fighting,</v>

3801
01:46:13.610 --> 01:46:15.380
<v Speaker 1>nobody makes that much money in a fight.</v>

3802
01:46:15.381 --> 01:46:16.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe Floyd Mayweather does,</v>

3803
01:46:16.881 --> 01:46:17.571
<v Speaker 1>but that's about it.</v>

3804
01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:20.510
<v Speaker 1>As far as like human beings has an insane amount of money,</v>

3805
01:46:20.570 --> 01:46:22.700
<v Speaker 1>$18 million in a fucking poker tournament.</v>

3806
01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:25.670
<v Speaker 1>They make real money because people love it.</v>

3807
01:46:25.850 --> 01:46:28.130
<v Speaker 1>If you get enough people that love it and they're willing to throw their chips</v>

3808
01:46:28.131 --> 01:46:28.460
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3809
01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:30.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean how many people had to be in that for you to win?</v>

3810
01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:32.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's very expensive.</v>

3811
01:46:32.601 --> 01:46:33.800
<v Speaker 1>People tournament or something.</v>

3812
01:46:33.860 --> 01:46:35.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an expensive by until,</v>

3813
01:46:35.650 --> 01:46:37.040
<v Speaker 1>cause those guys are worth so much money.</v>

3814
01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.010
<v Speaker 1>They'll do that by end.</v>

3815
01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:39.590
<v Speaker 1>Big World series one.</v>

3816
01:46:39.591 --> 01:46:43.090
<v Speaker 1>The big one in the bag is like they get up to like 8,000 people now starting</v>

3817
01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:43.551
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

3818
01:46:43.551 --> 01:46:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3834
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:04.300
<v Speaker 1>You know poker is a tricky game at Ari Shaffir he,</v>

3835
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:06.260
<v Speaker 1>he used to make a living doing poker when,</v>

3836
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:07.990
<v Speaker 1>when everything's sucked for him as a comedian.</v>

3837
01:47:07.991 --> 01:47:11.490
<v Speaker 1>I remember it like seeing him like on a few shows with Ari Shaffir when,</v>

3838
01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:13.060
<v Speaker 1>when things were sucking for him as a comedian,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3853
01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3854
01:47:29.970 --> 01:47:30.630
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal.</v>

3855
01:47:30.630 --> 01:47:30.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3856
01:47:30.871 --> 01:47:31.121
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

3857
01:47:31.121 --> 01:47:34.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a something and not giving it away to any kind of psychological</v>

3858
01:47:34.351 --> 01:47:34.921
<v Speaker 1>giveaway,</v>

3859
01:47:34.921 --> 01:47:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3860
01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:35.460
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3861
01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.000
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

3862
01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:36.960
<v Speaker 1>that's what I like watching,</v>

3863
01:47:36.961 --> 01:47:37.794
<v Speaker 1>like who,</v>

3864
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:38.850
<v Speaker 1>how that stuff works.</v>

3865
01:47:39.230 --> 01:47:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3866
01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you get to play all the time,</v>

3867
01:47:41.670 --> 01:47:43.130
<v Speaker 1>you can figure out the math is fine.</v>

3868
01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Most people can learn it.</v>

3869
01:47:44.101 --> 01:47:44.521
<v Speaker 1>There's that,</v>

3870
01:47:44.521 --> 01:47:46.170
<v Speaker 1>that's where the talent really comes in,</v>

3871
01:47:46.171 --> 01:47:47.910
<v Speaker 1>is that whole psychological side.</v>

3872
01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:48.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3873
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:50.220
<v Speaker 1>knowing math is talented,</v>

3874
01:47:50.221 --> 01:47:50.851
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3875
01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:51.370
<v Speaker 1>what I'm getting at?</v>

3876
01:47:51.370 --> 01:47:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Is it more artistic part of it and when,</v>

3877
01:47:53.731 --> 01:47:54.600
<v Speaker 1>if you play it all the time,</v>

3878
01:47:54.601 --> 01:47:56.940
<v Speaker 1>if you get really good at just smelling bullshit,</v>

3879
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3880
01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:57.781
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3881
01:47:57.781 --> 01:48:00.060
<v Speaker 1>it's like you get good at everything like you get,</v>

3882
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.990
<v Speaker 1>you would think.</v>

3883
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:01.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3884
01:48:01.211 --> 01:48:04.680
<v Speaker 1>You get mean people get better at all the subtle nuances of anything they</v>

3885
01:48:04.681 --> 01:48:05.370
<v Speaker 1>attempt,</v>

3886
01:48:05.370 --> 01:48:07.620
<v Speaker 1>whether it's standup comedy or playing music or anything.</v>

3887
01:48:07.621 --> 01:48:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that you interact with people playing the card game for high</v>

3888
01:48:11.221 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 1>stakes for a long period of time.</v>

3889
01:48:12.541 --> 01:48:14.910
<v Speaker 1>He probably smell some shit on people when they are full of shit.</v>

3890
01:48:15.230 --> 01:48:19.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just smell a something little intangible green light</v>

3891
01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.000
<v Speaker 1>or not or just kid yourself and blow your fat water.</v>

3892
01:48:24.350 --> 01:48:28.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean you would naturally just get a sense of it of like that movie true</v>

3893
01:48:28.111 --> 01:48:30.890
<v Speaker 1>romance where Christopher Walkin's talking about the tells of a,</v>

3894
01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.250
<v Speaker 1>you would think you would at least have more of a no.</v>

3895
01:48:35.250 --> 01:48:37.020
<v Speaker 1>What a crinkled Brower like when you know,</v>

3896
01:48:37.021 --> 01:48:39.980
<v Speaker 1>cause there's people that say psychologically like if you're lying,</v>

3897
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:42.360
<v Speaker 1>you look a certain way or if you're trying to recall something,</v>

3898
01:48:42.361 --> 01:48:43.290
<v Speaker 1>you look a different way.</v>

3899
01:48:43.291 --> 01:48:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Like your,</v>

3900
01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:44.850
<v Speaker 1>the way your brain works.</v>

3901
01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:45.421
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

3902
01:48:45.421 --> 01:48:48.150
<v Speaker 1>you can figure out some of that stuff legitimately.</v>

3903
01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:50.880
<v Speaker 1>And when people know that I don't trust them from then on,</v>

3904
01:48:50.881 --> 01:48:51.870
<v Speaker 1>now you know the moves.</v>

3905
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh you know it's left to right.</v>

3906
01:48:53.190 --> 01:48:53.940
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3907
01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:54.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3908
01:48:54.121 --> 01:48:55.050
<v Speaker 1>You cheat motherfucker.</v>

3909
01:48:55.051 --> 01:48:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Looking up to your left when you know you should be looking down to your right,</v>

3910
01:48:58.410 --> 01:49:02.610
<v Speaker 1>whichever one that only works if you're amongst unsuspecting people and you</v>

3911
01:49:02.611 --> 01:49:03.030
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

3912
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:05.630
<v Speaker 1>nobody can have knowledge that you have that you know.</v>

3913
01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I think people are,</v>

3914
01:49:06.751 --> 01:49:10.170
<v Speaker 1>everybody is scared of losing privacy and I agree it shouldn't.</v>

3915
01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Someone shouldn't be able to access your privacy random,</v>

3916
01:49:13.021 --> 01:49:13.720
<v Speaker 1>someone's [inaudible].</v>

3917
01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.740
<v Speaker 1>You should be able to access your email or see what's in your computer,</v>

3918
01:49:16.741 --> 01:49:20.880
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that eventually it's going to be a good thing for the world to</v>

3919
01:49:20.881 --> 01:49:21.720
<v Speaker 1>have no privacy.</v>

3920
01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:22.710
<v Speaker 1>It sounds stupid,</v>

3921
01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but I think that a lot of the problems that we have is that you can get away</v>

3922
01:49:25.741 --> 01:49:26.550
<v Speaker 1>with shit.</v>

3923
01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:30.180
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the problems that we have with as far as like committing crimes,</v>

3924
01:49:30.181 --> 01:49:33.960
<v Speaker 1>doing bad deeds to people is that people can't literally read each other's</v>

3925
01:49:33.961 --> 01:49:34.590
<v Speaker 1>minds.</v>

3926
01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that's ultimately where we're going.</v>

3927
01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:37.373
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to be,</v>

3928
01:49:37.530 --> 01:49:38.880
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be no line anymore.</v>

3929
01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people's emotional and problems stuff is not realizing that</v>

3930
01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:45.990
<v Speaker 1>everybody's exactly like you.</v>

3931
01:49:46.090 --> 01:49:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3932
01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:49.870
<v Speaker 1>You think your thing or whatever's wrong with you or whatever you think or that</v>

3933
01:49:49.871 --> 01:49:50.530
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

3934
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:50.830
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

3935
01:49:50.830 --> 01:49:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Everything that happens to you is only happening to you and you're embarrassed</v>

3936
01:49:53.501 --> 01:49:53.771
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

3937
01:49:53.771 --> 01:49:53.881
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3938
01:49:53.881 --> 01:49:57.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of things like that that people don't realize every single what he</v>

3939
01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:01.210
<v Speaker 1>has experienced on some level insecurity band.</v>

3940
01:50:01.211 --> 01:50:05.310
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a one consciousness almost like single consciousness for</v>

3941
01:50:05.311 --> 01:50:06.190
<v Speaker 1>the crazy people,</v>

3942
01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:07.000
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

3943
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:07.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3944
01:50:07.151 --> 01:50:08.590
<v Speaker 1>you can eliminate them easier.</v>

3945
01:50:08.650 --> 01:50:09.250
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>

3946
01:50:09.250 --> 01:50:10.460
<v Speaker 1>you got to find them and kill him.</v>

3947
01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:13.990
<v Speaker 1>But who's who's willing to make that call from notify them?</v>

3948
01:50:13.991 --> 01:50:14.910
<v Speaker 1>You can notify them,</v>

3949
01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:15.580
<v Speaker 1>hand them up,</v>

3950
01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:16.241
<v Speaker 1>box them up,</v>

3951
01:50:16.241 --> 01:50:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but then they get out and it becomes a God Damn Stephen King movie.</v>

3952
01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:19.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3953
01:50:19.211 --> 01:50:22.300
<v Speaker 1>well you know it's going somewhere someday is it?</v>

3954
01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Something's going to happen.</v>

3955
01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:24.341
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>

3956
01:50:24.341 --> 01:50:25.091
<v Speaker 1>if you look at,</v>

3957
01:50:25.091 --> 01:50:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're,</v>

3958
01:50:25.590 --> 01:50:26.560
<v Speaker 1>you're a thoughtful guy.</v>

3959
01:50:26.650 --> 01:50:30.010
<v Speaker 1>When you look at society and you look at Shit what's going down in Turkey and</v>

3960
01:50:30.011 --> 01:50:33.070
<v Speaker 1>the clamp down on the Internet where the government's worried about people being</v>

3961
01:50:33.071 --> 01:50:34.710
<v Speaker 1>able to rise and,</v>

3962
01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:35.930
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

3963
01:50:35.931 --> 01:50:38.530
<v Speaker 1>the second amendment debates and all the shit that's going on.</v>

3964
01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>

3965
01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:40.270
<v Speaker 1>how do you see this,</v>

3966
01:50:40.271 --> 01:50:40.660
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3967
01:50:40.660 --> 01:50:42.070
<v Speaker 1>this fucking thing turning out?</v>

3968
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:43.270
<v Speaker 1>When you look at our world?</v>

3969
01:50:44.710 --> 01:50:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a lot of it matters,</v>

3970
01:50:46.031 --> 01:50:46.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3971
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:48.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't think so in a weird,</v>

3972
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I just think eventually,</v>

3973
01:50:49.631 --> 01:50:50.171
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3974
01:50:50.171 --> 01:50:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Like the lights are gonna go out and for you,</v>

3975
01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:54.610
<v Speaker 1>for everybody,</v>

3976
01:50:54.610 --> 01:50:55.241
<v Speaker 1>for everybody,</v>

3977
01:50:55.241 --> 01:50:57.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about literally like not our lives.</v>

3978
01:50:57.401 --> 01:50:58.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about sooner or later,</v>

3979
01:50:58.481 --> 01:50:59.710
<v Speaker 1>a lot of this is going to go wrong.</v>

3980
01:50:59.711 --> 01:51:00.311
<v Speaker 1>We're going to use it.</v>

3981
01:51:00.311 --> 01:51:01.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much fuel,</v>

3982
01:51:01.241 --> 01:51:02.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not an expert,</v>

3983
01:51:02.411 --> 01:51:07.240
<v Speaker 1>but it fuels gotta be all the fuels that we use so rapidly right now.</v>

3984
01:51:07.820 --> 01:51:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Can't be infinite.</v>

3985
01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:09.880
<v Speaker 1>You want to hear something interesting?</v>

3986
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:10.600
<v Speaker 1>I talked to,</v>

3987
01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:10.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3988
01:51:10.810 --> 01:51:11.643
<v Speaker 1>whether scientists,</v>

3989
01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:12.460
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3990
01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:15.310
<v Speaker 1>he told me that even if we chopped down every tree in the world,</v>

3991
01:51:15.311 --> 01:51:16.840
<v Speaker 1>we'd still have a couple of million years of air.</v>

3992
01:51:18.210 --> 01:51:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that?</v>

3993
01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:19.060
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>

3994
01:51:19.060 --> 01:51:20.790
<v Speaker 1>everybody's worried about like losing all the air.</v>

3995
01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:21.450
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to do?</v>

3996
01:51:21.450 --> 01:51:22.283
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

3997
01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:24.353
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

3998
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.490
<v Speaker 1>But the world is far more durable then.</v>

3999
01:51:27.491 --> 01:51:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Then we pretend it is.</v>

4000
01:51:28.810 --> 01:51:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about the world or the planet</v>

4001
01:51:31.870 --> 01:51:32.440
<v Speaker 1>within it,</v>

4002
01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:32.861
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

4003
01:51:32.861 --> 01:51:33.900
<v Speaker 1>And our use of like,</v>

4004
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:34.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4005
01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:34.660
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4006
01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:35.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4007
01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:35.471
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

4008
01:51:35.471 --> 01:51:35.801
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

4009
01:51:35.801 --> 01:51:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I just said I'm no expert,</v>

4010
01:51:36.881 --> 01:51:39.670
<v Speaker 1>but like fossil fuels cannot be infinite,</v>

4011
01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:40.653
<v Speaker 1>no county.</v>

4012
01:51:40.740 --> 01:51:41.501
<v Speaker 1>So eventually,</v>

4013
01:51:41.501 --> 01:51:42.100
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

4014
01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:44.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna if the lights are going to go out and we're all going to be</v>

4015
01:51:44.171 --> 01:51:44.741
<v Speaker 1>swamped people,</v>

4016
01:51:44.741 --> 01:51:44.891
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

4017
01:51:44.891 --> 01:51:46.240
<v Speaker 1>that's funny because I don't think so.</v>

4018
01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I think that I would've never figured out how to make you want to know.</v>

4019
01:51:49.061 --> 01:51:49.361
<v Speaker 1>Honestly.</v>

4020
01:51:49.361 --> 01:51:52.120
<v Speaker 1>That's what I hope I would have never figured out how to make a regular engine</v>

4021
01:51:52.121 --> 01:51:54.750
<v Speaker 1>and I'm never going to figure out how to make a fucking electric engine and</v>

4022
01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:55.790
<v Speaker 1>shoot my gun and I can,</v>

4023
01:51:55.850 --> 01:51:57.640
<v Speaker 1>I can reload bullets for sure.</v>

4024
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:58.361
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

4025
01:51:58.361 --> 01:52:01.420
<v Speaker 1>There's some people way smarter than me that are looking at all these problems</v>

4026
01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:04.510
<v Speaker 1>and the same sort of genius that allowed people get to the point where we have</v>

4027
01:52:04.511 --> 01:52:09.070
<v Speaker 1>flying metal tubes to take you from New York to Paris and five hours you did</v>

4028
01:52:09.071 --> 01:52:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Howard saying we're going to have the same kind of shit with,</v>

4029
01:52:11.551 --> 01:52:12.570
<v Speaker 1>with everything it would.</v>

4030
01:52:12.610 --> 01:52:15.430
<v Speaker 1>People are going to eventually innovate pass where we're at.</v>

4031
01:52:15.490 --> 01:52:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I have a full family from that because the nine one day,</v>

4032
01:52:19.210 --> 01:52:20.043
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

4033
01:52:20.190 --> 01:52:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4034
01:52:20.770 --> 01:52:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to change,</v>

4035
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:22.521
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

4036
01:52:22.521 --> 01:52:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't think lights are going to go out.</v>

4037
01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:25.930
<v Speaker 1>They might go out for a little while and then come back on.</v>

4038
01:52:25.931 --> 01:52:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean at any point in time that could be a series of colossal disasters,</v>

4039
01:52:30.041 --> 01:52:31.060
<v Speaker 1>natural disasters,</v>

4040
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:34.210
<v Speaker 1>and we just look at the history of the world that we know about for sure.</v>

4041
01:52:34.211 --> 01:52:35.044
<v Speaker 1>There's been some,</v>

4042
01:52:35.170 --> 01:52:39.310
<v Speaker 1>at least I think there's four or five extinction events that had been marked</v>

4043
01:52:39.311 --> 01:52:43.540
<v Speaker 1>throughout history that we know of right now and pretend that we know everything</v>

4044
01:52:43.541 --> 01:52:46.700
<v Speaker 1>that happened over the four point whatever billion years</v>

4045
01:52:46.700 --> 01:52:48.760
<v Speaker 6>of the Earth's time at this point is,</v>

4046
01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:49.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4047
01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.031
<v Speaker 6>that is a lot of shit.</v>

4048
01:52:50.031 --> 01:52:50.450
<v Speaker 6>They don't know.</v>

4049
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:52.610
<v Speaker 6>There's 12,002 Asian aliens.</v>

4050
01:52:52.611 --> 01:52:52.890
<v Speaker 6>Again,</v>

4051
01:52:52.890 --> 01:52:53.580
<v Speaker 6>are we not,</v>

4052
01:52:53.580 --> 01:52:55.760
<v Speaker 6>are we going in to the fact that people been,</v>

4053
01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:56.270
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4054
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:57.740
<v Speaker 6>lucky that we made it to this point,</v>

4055
01:52:57.741 --> 01:53:00.030
<v Speaker 6>but we could go just bite the dinosaur wet this.</v>

4056
01:53:00.090 --> 01:53:01.160
<v Speaker 6>It's really my point.</v>

4057
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:02.143
<v Speaker 6>Fuck yeah,</v>

4058
01:53:02.230 --> 01:53:06.060
<v Speaker 6>but that will another society eventually rise up and I believe,</v>

4059
01:53:06.140 --> 01:53:06.390
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4060
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.711
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>

4061
01:53:06.711 --> 01:53:06.951
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>

4062
01:53:06.951 --> 01:53:07.311
<v Speaker 6>Whatever.</v>

4063
01:53:07.311 --> 01:53:08.540
<v Speaker 6>But like as far as I'm concerned,</v>

4064
01:53:08.541 --> 01:53:08.990
<v Speaker 6>like my,</v>

4065
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:10.310
<v Speaker 6>I got my daily problems.</v>

4066
01:53:10.311 --> 01:53:11.144
<v Speaker 6>I don't,</v>

4067
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:13.850
<v Speaker 6>I don't the government and the clamp down in the Internet,</v>

4068
01:53:13.851 --> 01:53:14.540
<v Speaker 6>fuck the Internet.</v>

4069
01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:15.410
<v Speaker 6>I honestly told,</v>

4070
01:53:15.411 --> 01:53:16.041
<v Speaker 6>I've said many,</v>

4071
01:53:16.041 --> 01:53:18.680
<v Speaker 6>many times if I could get rid of one thing,</v>

4072
01:53:18.681 --> 01:53:21.000
<v Speaker 6>like I think for every great thing to Internet's done it.</v>

4073
01:53:21.001 --> 01:53:22.130
<v Speaker 6>There's a thousand slimy,</v>

4074
01:53:22.131 --> 01:53:24.980
<v Speaker 6>he's coming fucking awful rotten things about it.</v>

4075
01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:25.491
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>

4076
01:53:25.491 --> 01:53:26.210
<v Speaker 6>that's interesting.</v>

4077
01:53:26.210 --> 01:53:27.770
<v Speaker 6>I look at it a completely opposite.</v>

4078
01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.631
<v Speaker 6>I think for every one.</v>

4079
01:53:28.631 --> 01:53:29.700
<v Speaker 6>I mean it changed my house,</v>

4080
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.451
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

4081
01:53:30.451 --> 01:53:30.621
<v Speaker 6>It did.</v>

4082
01:53:30.621 --> 01:53:32.660
<v Speaker 6>I change the trajectory of a whole business that,</v>

4083
01:53:32.670 --> 01:53:32.930
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4084
01:53:32.930 --> 01:53:33.890
<v Speaker 6>I depended on to,</v>

4085
01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:34.170
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4086
01:53:34.170 --> 01:53:34.300
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

4087
01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:39.020
<v Speaker 6>I think Dan took the carpet enabled on delivery on levels that I never would</v>

4088
01:53:39.021 --> 01:53:44.021
<v Speaker 6>have imagined in like 1995 it thievery meaning people illegally downloaded</v>

4089
01:53:44.091 --> 01:53:44.900
<v Speaker 6>songs.</v>

4090
01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:45.171
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4091
01:53:45.171 --> 01:53:45.681
<v Speaker 6>Not only that.</v>

4092
01:53:45.681 --> 01:53:45.951
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

4093
01:53:45.951 --> 01:53:47.240
<v Speaker 6>And then let's just go with the,</v>

4094
01:53:47.241 --> 01:53:47.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4095
01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:48.500
<v Speaker 6>small things like,</v>

4096
01:53:48.501 --> 01:53:48.711
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4097
01:53:48.711 --> 01:53:49.041
<v Speaker 6>back,</v>

4098
01:53:49.041 --> 01:53:49.281
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4099
01:53:49.281 --> 01:53:53.450
<v Speaker 6>maybe in the 90s if there was a guy who liked fucking pigs,</v>

4100
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:54.351
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

4101
01:53:54.351 --> 01:53:56.870
<v Speaker 6>He'd be alone fucking wolf somewhere that,</v>

4102
01:53:56.900 --> 01:53:57.171
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4103
01:53:57.171 --> 01:53:58.580
<v Speaker 6>would never really act on it or anything.</v>

4104
01:53:58.581 --> 01:53:59.390
<v Speaker 6>Now there's probably,</v>

4105
01:53:59.390 --> 01:54:01.300
<v Speaker 6>you could probably find a website dedicated to that.</v>

4106
01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:02.630
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4107
01:54:02.630 --> 01:54:05.300
<v Speaker 6>this is most certainly if people gather and they fuck pigs,</v>

4108
01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.140
<v Speaker 6>that's mine.</v>

4109
01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:07.030
<v Speaker 6>That's bad for society.</v>

4110
01:54:07.031 --> 01:54:07.310
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4111
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:08.480
<v Speaker 6>Why is it okay to eat pigs?</v>

4112
01:54:08.481 --> 01:54:09.510
<v Speaker 6>But it's not okay to fuck them.</v>

4113
01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:10.430
<v Speaker 6>That's what I want to know.</v>

4114
01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:11.500
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4115
01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:12.333
<v Speaker 6>I feel like,</v>

4116
01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:15.150
<v Speaker 6>I still feel like I love you dude.</v>

4117
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:17.780
<v Speaker 6>Podcast is might be over after that.</v>

4118
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:19.223
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel like,</v>

4119
01:54:19.230 --> 01:54:22.040
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if I have any response to that legitimately.</v>

4120
01:54:22.041 --> 01:54:23.360
<v Speaker 6>I don't feel like that makes any sense.</v>

4121
01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:24.381
<v Speaker 6>I feel like,</v>

4122
01:54:24.381 --> 01:54:24.740
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4123
01:54:24.740 --> 01:54:25.300
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>

4124
01:54:25.300 --> 01:54:25.640
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4125
01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:27.880
<v Speaker 6>if you will fuck people and we,</v>

4126
01:54:28.030 --> 01:54:28.863
<v Speaker 6>and eating them is wrong.</v>

4127
01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:29.840
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

4128
01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:33.650
<v Speaker 6>well it's not wrong if you're trapped like car crashed in the Andes mountains</v>

4129
01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:35.270
<v Speaker 6>and just eating a person.</v>

4130
01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:36.980
<v Speaker 6>Well people have done it.</v>

4131
01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.690
<v Speaker 6>I mean the whole bond or party,</v>

4132
01:54:38.691 --> 01:54:40.610
<v Speaker 6>those people that got stuck in the Rockies,</v>

4133
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:45.230
<v Speaker 6>people done it and it's a notoriously fucking like bad story.</v>

4134
01:54:45.231 --> 01:54:46.700
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not cool.</v>

4135
01:54:47.190 --> 01:54:49.640
<v Speaker 6>It's not like things you should do on a regular basis.</v>

4136
01:54:49.930 --> 01:54:51.380
<v Speaker 6>But I mean fucking pigs,</v>

4137
01:54:51.381 --> 01:54:52.550
<v Speaker 6>let's just apply the same,</v>

4138
01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:53.840
<v Speaker 6>probably the same logic.</v>

4139
01:54:53.841 --> 01:54:56.270
<v Speaker 6>How about you're stuck on an island and there's no people to fuck,</v>

4140
01:54:56.330 --> 01:54:59.090
<v Speaker 6>but you got a think and they come back after all these years.</v>

4141
01:54:59.091 --> 01:54:59.201
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

4142
01:54:59.201 --> 01:54:59.571
<v Speaker 6>hey man,</v>

4143
01:54:59.571 --> 01:55:00.250
<v Speaker 6>what were you doing?</v>

4144
01:55:00.250 --> 01:55:00.440
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

4145
01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:01.760
<v Speaker 6>well I raised pigs and a,</v>

4146
01:55:01.761 --> 01:55:03.410
<v Speaker 6>and I killed him for food.</v>

4147
01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:03.850
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4148
01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:04.131
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

4149
01:55:04.131 --> 01:55:04.730
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>

4150
01:55:04.730 --> 01:55:05.660
<v Speaker 6>What would you do for sex?</v>

4151
01:55:05.661 --> 01:55:06.590
<v Speaker 6>He just beat off a lot.</v>

4152
01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.070
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

4153
01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:08.210
<v Speaker 6>I just fucked my pigs.</v>

4154
01:55:08.810 --> 01:55:09.171
<v Speaker 6>They'd be like,</v>

4155
01:55:09.171 --> 01:55:09.940
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

4156
01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:10.773
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>

4157
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:11.870
<v Speaker 6>Not Cool.</v>

4158
01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:12.720
<v Speaker 6>He did something.</v>

4159
01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:14.120
<v Speaker 6>Should have just kept that to yourself,</v>

4160
01:55:14.121 --> 01:55:14.331
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4161
01:55:14.331 --> 01:55:15.164
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

4162
01:55:15.390 --> 01:55:16.700
<v Speaker 6>That's really what it is.</v>

4163
01:55:18.300 --> 01:55:20.060
<v Speaker 6>Would it be worse if he made love to the pig?</v>

4164
01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.470
<v Speaker 6>I don't think either one is bad.</v>

4165
01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:22.611
<v Speaker 6>I think honestly,</v>

4166
01:55:22.611 --> 01:55:23.720
<v Speaker 6>if you're going to kill an animal,</v>

4167
01:55:23.810 --> 01:55:24.380
<v Speaker 6>fucking it,</v>

4168
01:55:24.380 --> 01:55:26.720
<v Speaker 6>as long as you don't like fuck it to death.</v>

4169
01:55:26.810 --> 01:55:30.430
<v Speaker 6>That's kind of a crazy way to kill something and we just go anal with the pig or</v>

4170
01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:31.273
<v Speaker 6>vagina.</v>

4171
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:32.600
<v Speaker 6>She'd have to see the setup.</v>

4172
01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:34.070
<v Speaker 6>You have to see what you deal with,</v>

4173
01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:34.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4174
01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:35.121
<v Speaker 6>condom,</v>

4175
01:55:35.121 --> 01:55:35.781
<v Speaker 6>no condom.</v>

4176
01:55:35.781 --> 01:55:36.614
<v Speaker 6>It's about a question.</v>

4177
01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:38.030
<v Speaker 6>Internal organ lies.</v>

4178
01:55:38.031 --> 01:55:39.950
<v Speaker 6>Pigs are supposed to be very similar to us.</v>

4179
01:55:39.951 --> 01:55:40.940
<v Speaker 6>So you don't,</v>

4180
01:55:40.941 --> 01:55:43.320
<v Speaker 6>you definitely don't want to go anal without a little cleanup first.</v>

4181
01:55:43.321 --> 01:55:43.880
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4182
01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:44.010
<v Speaker 6>you</v>

4183
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:46.650
<v Speaker 1>get some pig shit through the tip of your deck for sure.</v>

4184
01:55:46.680 --> 01:55:47.520
<v Speaker 1>That can be a problem.</v>

4185
01:55:47.550 --> 01:55:47.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4186
01:55:47.671 --> 01:55:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if I ever,</v>

4187
01:55:48.610 --> 01:55:49.500
<v Speaker 1>if this correct,</v>

4188
01:55:49.501 --> 01:55:49.831
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

4189
01:55:49.831 --> 01:55:52.240
<v Speaker 1>isn't there like a pig's extra excrement?</v>

4190
01:55:52.290 --> 01:55:52.520
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

4191
01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:52.810
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

4192
01:55:52.810 --> 01:55:53.120
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

4193
01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:54.120
<v Speaker 1>his entire,</v>

4194
01:55:54.510 --> 01:55:58.500
<v Speaker 1>she think her story system is basically expelling waste.</v>

4195
01:55:59.130 --> 01:56:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Like the sweat to a certain degree is oh really?</v>

4196
01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4197
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:03.690
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>

4198
01:56:03.690 --> 01:56:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4199
01:56:04.230 --> 01:56:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Pigs are disgusting.</v>

4200
01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:06.420
<v Speaker 1>They're strange animals,</v>

4201
01:56:06.421 --> 01:56:06.631
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4202
01:56:06.631 --> 01:56:07.590
<v Speaker 1>They're smart as fuck though.</v>

4203
01:56:08.040 --> 01:56:09.660
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing that's weird about killing pigs.</v>

4204
01:56:09.661 --> 01:56:10.341
<v Speaker 1>They're smart man.</v>

4205
01:56:10.341 --> 01:56:11.340
<v Speaker 1>A smarter than dogs.</v>

4206
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:12.300
<v Speaker 1>They know what's going on.</v>

4207
01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4208
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you know the whole animal farm thing,</v>

4209
01:56:15.090 --> 01:56:15.900
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4210
01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:17.070
<v Speaker 1>Well if you still have that book,</v>

4211
01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I can make a pick squirt.</v>

4212
01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:19.860
<v Speaker 1>You ever see that documentary?</v>

4213
01:56:19.861 --> 01:56:20.850
<v Speaker 1>A my brother's keeper,</v>

4214
01:56:22.050 --> 01:56:23.910
<v Speaker 1>it's documented about these dudes were like,</v>

4215
01:56:24.330 --> 01:56:28.110
<v Speaker 1>they were like a little slow and they lived on a farm and one of them I think</v>

4216
01:56:28.111 --> 01:56:31.230
<v Speaker 1>was accused of murder and it was like real weird whether or not they could</v>

4217
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:32.640
<v Speaker 1>defend themselves in court,</v>

4218
01:56:32.641 --> 01:56:33.240
<v Speaker 1>whether they could,</v>

4219
01:56:33.240 --> 01:56:33.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4220
01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:34.890
<v Speaker 1>there were there a little mentally challenged,</v>

4221
01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:35.941
<v Speaker 1>but they uh,</v>

4222
01:56:35.941 --> 01:56:38.520
<v Speaker 1>with running this farm and there's a scene in the farm where he has to kill a</v>

4223
01:56:38.521 --> 01:56:41.250
<v Speaker 1>pig and he pulls out the shotgun and the pay goes fuck.</v>

4224
01:56:41.610 --> 01:56:44.280
<v Speaker 1>And the pig just scrambles left and right.</v>

4225
01:56:44.281 --> 01:56:48.060
<v Speaker 1>That pig knows exactly what the fuck is going on to pick saw the shotgun.</v>

4226
01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:50.100
<v Speaker 1>And I saw that and that kept me from eating,</v>

4227
01:56:50.130 --> 01:56:52.890
<v Speaker 1>begging or any pig for like at least two days.</v>

4228
01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:56.670
<v Speaker 1>It was like a month just silent for a month.</v>

4229
01:56:56.671 --> 01:56:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

4230
01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:57.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

4231
01:56:57.721 --> 01:56:58.440
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm not,</v>

4232
01:56:58.440 --> 01:56:59.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to need anything that's smart.</v>

4233
01:57:00.580 --> 01:57:01.413
<v Speaker 1>Kind of</v>

4234
01:57:02.880 --> 01:57:03.713
<v Speaker 1>delicious.</v>

4235
01:57:03.810 --> 01:57:04.890
<v Speaker 1>But then I found out what cops,</v>

4236
01:57:04.891 --> 01:57:08.610
<v Speaker 1>pigs are you fall into if you like feeding pigs and you fall in there that eat</v>

4237
01:57:08.611 --> 01:57:08.850
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

4238
01:57:08.850 --> 01:57:11.150
<v Speaker 1>That's like number one way that farm was dying.</v>

4239
01:57:11.330 --> 01:57:12.640
<v Speaker 1>One of those Dr. Barton,</v>

4240
01:57:12.641 --> 01:57:16.050
<v Speaker 1>the autopsy things where they did this whole thing on this lady that had a pig</v>

4241
01:57:16.051 --> 01:57:18.950
<v Speaker 1>farm and just murder husbands and throw their butts in the pit.</v>

4242
01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:21.000
<v Speaker 1>That was a great show.</v>

4243
01:57:21.570 --> 01:57:26.440
<v Speaker 1>That guy was the best that doctor Paten I lift a love the HPL autopsies show it,</v>

4244

4245
01:57:27.330 --> 01:57:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Challenged your,</v>

4246
01:57:28.370 --> 01:57:30.450
<v Speaker 1>your view of the world before the Internet,</v>

4247
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:31.561
<v Speaker 1>before the Internet.</v>

4248
01:57:31.561 --> 01:57:32.940
<v Speaker 1>That was the first freak out show.</v>

4249
01:57:33.450 --> 01:57:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Well you realize how crazy people are.</v>

4257
01:57:55.471 --> 01:57:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I remember he was so in love with her that he took her,</v>

4263
01:58:06.990 --> 01:58:11.430
<v Speaker 1>but he took her and he was just perfect during his Rafkin her body.</v>

<v Speaker 1>dudes are.</v>

4270
01:58:19.531 --> 01:58:21.570
<v Speaker 1>When that single consciousness comes around,</v>

4271
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:22.200
<v Speaker 1>it's coming.</v>

4272

<v Speaker 1>Don't you think with what you're talking about with like you know,</v>

4275
01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.670
<v Speaker 1>people realizing that you know,</v>

4276
01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:36.990
<v Speaker 1>one consciousness realizing that doing to others as you would have them do to</v>

4277
01:58:36.991 --> 01:58:37.321
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

4278
01:58:37.321 --> 01:58:38.250
<v Speaker 1>you lead a healthy,</v>

4279
01:58:38.251 --> 01:58:42.700
<v Speaker 1>happy light and y'all were all like calming down and connecting in this thing.</v>

4280
01:58:42.701 --> 01:58:42.851
<v Speaker 1>It all,</v>

4281
01:58:42.851 --> 01:58:46.650
<v Speaker 1>it's all building toward this crescendo and if it reaches that one state where</v>

4282
01:58:46.651 --> 01:58:47.021
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>

4283
01:58:47.021 --> 01:58:51.190
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a technology or whether it's just the human body evolving to a next</v>

4284
01:58:51.191 --> 01:58:51.870
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

4285
01:58:51.870 --> 01:58:54.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a few generations away and mean who the fuck knows?</v>

4286
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:58.660
<v Speaker 1>But that's what I feel like the one thing that's going to stop all the bullshit</v>

4287
01:58:58.870 --> 01:59:00.900
<v Speaker 1>because when everybody knows the bullshit stage,</v>

4288
01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you think we're going to get to that.</v>

4289
01:59:02.290 --> 01:59:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to get to a connectivity very similar to the Internet,</v>

4290
01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:07.000
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be in your own brain.</v>

4291
01:59:07.090 --> 01:59:07.923
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think.</v>

4292
01:59:08.020 --> 01:59:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that the connectivity of the Internet gives you through social media.</v>

4293
01:59:11.981 --> 01:59:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it's almost like sticking your finger through.</v>

4294
01:59:15.041 --> 01:59:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

4295
01:59:15.340 --> 01:59:15.611
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4296
01:59:15.611 --> 01:59:19.330
<v Speaker 1>you can't get to the outside but you can like poke your finger through this like</v>

4297
01:59:19.331 --> 01:59:23.110
<v Speaker 1>gelatinous sort of shield that separates the two worlds.</v>

4298
01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:24.850
<v Speaker 1>You can't quite break through,</v>

4299
01:59:25.030 --> 01:59:25.661
<v Speaker 1>but it's close.</v>

4300
01:59:25.661 --> 01:59:26.411
<v Speaker 1>So the Internet is like,</v>

4301
01:59:26.411 --> 01:59:27.940
<v Speaker 1>you're exchanging information,</v>

4302
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:28.783
<v Speaker 1>it's free.</v>

4303
01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:31.780
<v Speaker 1>The whole cut into the girl right there.</v>

4304
01:59:31.950 --> 01:59:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Same,</v>

4305
01:59:32.380 --> 01:59:33.213
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

4306
01:59:33.310 --> 01:59:35.140
<v Speaker 1>We're using computers in order to,</v>

4307
01:59:35.141 --> 01:59:35.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4308
01:59:35.411 --> 01:59:38.500
<v Speaker 1>we're sending like ones and Zeros to each other and we're connecting.</v>

4309
01:59:38.501 --> 01:59:40.600
<v Speaker 1>But we're doing all this through this artificial shit.</v>

4310
01:59:40.930 --> 01:59:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I think eventually this artificial shit,</v>

4311
01:59:42.371 --> 01:59:45.340
<v Speaker 1>this is just a bridge to some sort of technological freedom.</v>

4312
01:59:45.341 --> 01:59:47.260
<v Speaker 1>This is a bridge towards some next step,</v>

4313
01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:50.110
<v Speaker 1>whether it's saying something will be implanted.</v>

4314
01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:50.973
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't be,</v>

4315
01:59:51.010 --> 01:59:53.670
<v Speaker 1>it could be that I'm going to this,</v>

4316
01:59:53.690 --> 01:59:54.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4317
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:54.971
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to,</v>

4318
01:59:54.971 --> 01:59:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you can just die off like the fucking,</v>

4319
01:59:56.620 --> 01:59:57.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4320
01:59:57.190 --> 01:59:58.023
<v Speaker 1>like all the other,</v>

4321
01:59:58.210 --> 01:59:59.440
<v Speaker 1>my nothing wrong with that man.</v>

4322
01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:01.630
<v Speaker 1>This is a romantic thing to that they'd go out,</v>

4323
02:00:01.631 --> 02:00:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Johnny Cash style,</v>

4324
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:04.420
<v Speaker 1>all old singing hurt,</v>

4325
02:00:04.660 --> 02:00:05.493
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4326
02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:05.921
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

4327
02:00:05.921 --> 02:00:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4328
02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:07.420
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

4329
02:00:07.421 --> 02:00:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4330
02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>we all go to sleep.</v>

4331
02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:09.200
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4332
02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:12.490
<v Speaker 1>just I just know the fucking history of corporations in the world.</v>

4333
02:00:12.491 --> 02:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>And Shit and I'm not letting anybody putting it in my fucking,</v>

4334
02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:15.280
<v Speaker 1>that's the question though.</v>

4335
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.430
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

4336
02:00:15.430 --> 02:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>What does that eliminate all the bullshit that corporations do when,</v>

4337
02:00:19.211 --> 02:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>when everyone's accountable for their own actions?</v>

4338
02:00:21.071 --> 02:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Is that the thing that the manufacturer or the thing that goes in your brain?</v>

4339
02:00:23.840 --> 02:00:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4340
02:00:24.130 --> 02:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's inevitable progress.</v>

4341
02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the inevitable progression of where technology is heading.</v>

4342
02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:29.081
<v Speaker 1>So Joe,</v>

4343
02:00:29.081 --> 02:00:30.340
<v Speaker 1>you have such a great outlet,</v>

4344
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4345
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I do occasionally.</v>

4346
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm way too suspicious of people.</v>

4347
02:00:33.791 --> 02:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>

4348
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I know that the true nature of a lot of motherfucking people,</v>

4349
02:00:38.381 --> 02:00:38.951
<v Speaker 1>that's true,</v>

4350
02:00:38.951 --> 02:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>but don't you know great people as well.</v>

4351
02:00:41.620 --> 02:00:43.630
<v Speaker 1>Just the fact that those beautiful people exist.</v>

4352
02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I know enough beautiful people,</v>

4353
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>beautiful personalities,</v>

4354
02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.011
<v Speaker 1>friendly,</v>

4355
02:00:48.011 --> 02:00:48.371
<v Speaker 1>healthy,</v>

4356
02:00:48.371 --> 02:00:48.971
<v Speaker 1>happy people.</v>

4357
02:00:48.971 --> 02:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>I know enough of them now to be convinced that it's not like an aberration.</v>

4358
02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:53.761
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

4359
02:00:53.761 --> 02:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole population of likeminded happy people out there.</v>

4360
02:00:57.970 --> 02:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's separated from each other.</v>

4361
02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily true.</v>

4362
02:01:02.051 --> 02:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Even the evil people themselves are surrounded by other either evil people.</v>

4363
02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a big issue with evil people.</v>

4364
02:01:06.791 --> 02:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>You're growing up around evil people.</v>

4365
02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>You respond to your environment,</v>

4366
02:01:09.581 --> 02:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you imitate your atmosphere,</v>

4367
02:01:10.810 --> 02:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>you're a cunt.</v>

4368
02:01:11.590 --> 02:01:11.951
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4369
02:01:11.951 --> 02:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it's not even your own fault.</v>

4370
02:01:13.511 --> 02:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>You just stuck in a shit spot with a Douchebag,</v>

4371
02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:18.730
<v Speaker 1>dad and a mother who's a fucking cocaine addict or whatever,</v>

4372
02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>fill in the blank with your own troubles and dilemmas.</v>

4373
02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:24.640
<v Speaker 1>But I think that ultimately there's so many cool people and so many nice people</v>

4374
02:01:24.641 --> 02:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>and people that want other people to be happy that I just feel like that's,</v>

4375
02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the trend of where they live in that world.</v>

4376
02:01:30.340 --> 02:01:30.881
<v Speaker 1>Then that's,</v>

4377
02:01:30.881 --> 02:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>that's the world we should all live in.</v>

4378
02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible.</v>

4379
02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the fact that there's so many of them means it's not impossible.</v>

4380
02:01:38.230 --> 02:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just at point.</v>

4381
02:01:39.381 --> 02:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Do I have to give up my guns?</v>

4382
02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:41.480
<v Speaker 1>You have to give up shit.</v>

4383
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:42.141
<v Speaker 1>Why don't I don't,</v>

4384
02:01:42.141 --> 02:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>that's I'm not giving up.</v>

4385
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should give up guns.</v>

4386
02:01:45.441 --> 02:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's ridiculous.</v>

4387
02:01:46.311 --> 02:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should give up your car either.</v>

4388
02:01:47.841 --> 02:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should give up your ability to buy lighter fluid.</v>

4389
02:01:50.210 --> 02:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he should give up your ability to,</v>

4390
02:01:52.530 --> 02:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>to buy a fucking helicopter.</v>

4391
02:01:54.230 --> 02:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you should limit your ability to do anything.</v>

4392
02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I think freedom is the most important thing and then be responsible for your</v>

4393
02:01:59.571 --> 02:01:59.931
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>

4394
02:01:59.931 --> 02:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but stop people from doing country shit by making them aware of one</v>

4395
02:02:04.341 --> 02:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

4396
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:09.320
<v Speaker 1>making them aware that we all are experiencing this together and if you fuck</v>

4397
02:02:09.321 --> 02:02:09.741
<v Speaker 1>with people,</v>

4398
02:02:09.741 --> 02:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>if you send out some bad shit,</v>

4399
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:12.980
<v Speaker 1>that bad shit comes back to you too.</v>

4400
02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:13.371
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4401
02:02:13.371 --> 02:02:14.204
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>

4402
02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a met so many nice people.</v>

4403
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

4404
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>it needs to be like when you were talking about Islam and about the messages of</v>

4405
02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:22.281
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

4406
02:02:22.281 --> 02:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>they rang true in your mind and they made sense to you and you felt like it was</v>

4407
02:02:26.481 --> 02:02:29.270
<v Speaker 1>a this conglomeration of wisdom,</v>

4408
02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:29.961
<v Speaker 1>so to say.</v>

4409
02:02:29.961 --> 02:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4410
02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:31.073
<v Speaker 1>I thought of it still does.</v>

4411
02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:31.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4412
02:02:31.491 --> 02:02:32.121
<v Speaker 1>and it's still,</v>

4413
02:02:32.121 --> 02:02:32.954
<v Speaker 1>it should,</v>

4414
02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're just missing a new version of that.</v>

4415
02:02:36.410 --> 02:02:37.243
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>

4416
02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:38.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not that people,</v>

4417
02:02:38.651 --> 02:02:42.380
<v Speaker 1>I could feel that and I think that with technology at the helm,</v>

4418
02:02:42.590 --> 02:02:45.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible for that to influence it as well.</v>

4419
02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:46.341
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

4420
02:02:46.341 --> 02:02:46.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

4421
02:02:46.550 --> 02:02:51.080
<v Speaker 1>the connectivity that we all share and the inevitable it bill ability to</v>

4422
02:02:51.081 --> 02:02:53.840
<v Speaker 1>exchange information freely without a computer,</v>

4423
02:02:53.841 --> 02:02:54.501
<v Speaker 1>without anything,</v>

4424
02:02:54.501 --> 02:02:55.670
<v Speaker 1>just connect to people freely.</v>

4425
02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:57.380
<v Speaker 1>We could have never pictured this.</v>

4426
02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:57.761
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>

4427
02:02:57.761 --> 02:03:00.770
<v Speaker 1>no one in George Washington's time saw a laptop coming.</v>

4428
02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no way and I think that we have no fucking idea what's waiting</v>

4429
02:03:05.301 --> 02:03:06.500
<v Speaker 1>around the corner in a hundred years.</v>

4430
02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can,</v>

4431
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:09.110
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you look at the,</v>

4432
02:03:09.111 --> 02:03:09.944
<v Speaker 1>where it's going,</v>

4433
02:03:10.130 --> 02:03:12.350
<v Speaker 1>it's going towards just a full separation.</v>

4434
02:03:12.351 --> 02:03:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I speculate closer to 20 and 30 years.</v>

4435
02:03:14.690 --> 02:03:15.050
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

4436
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:16.130
<v Speaker 1>So no I don't think,</v>

4437
02:03:16.131 --> 02:03:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I think what you're saying is going to happen in there and I'm saying but that's</v>

4438
02:03:18.561 --> 02:03:19.394
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

4439
02:03:19.490 --> 02:03:22.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't speculate out farther neck cause I don't expect to live longer than</v>

4440
02:03:22.971 --> 02:03:23.360
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4441
02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:26.780
<v Speaker 1>You know this part of me that thinks it's fascinating that like what if society</v>

4442
02:03:26.781 --> 02:03:29.690
<v Speaker 1>got like just close to ignite enlightenment.</v>

4443
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Just close like almost there like breakthrough technology walls dissolving every</v>

4444
02:03:34.611 --> 02:03:36.050
<v Speaker 1>second and then an asteroid.</v>

4445
02:03:38.610 --> 02:03:40.740
<v Speaker 1>That's money we have to start all over again.</v>

4446
02:03:41.050 --> 02:03:45.200
<v Speaker 1>That's it brought me right back to the lights going out.</v>

4447
02:03:45.740 --> 02:03:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Well you paint with a dark brush.</v>

4448
02:03:47.301 --> 02:03:47.691
<v Speaker 1>My brother,</v>

4449
02:03:47.691 --> 02:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>that's where I came with a dark prod.</v>

4450
02:03:49.130 --> 02:03:49.831
<v Speaker 1>That's why I love it.</v>

4451
02:03:49.831 --> 02:03:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I like your world.</v>

4452
02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4453
02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:55.400
<v Speaker 1>well my world is your world that we exist in the same space.</v>

4454
02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Well I like the window.</v>

4455
02:03:56.511 --> 02:03:57.770
<v Speaker 1>You're looking through your world.</v>

4456
02:03:58.970 --> 02:03:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I need to get me one.</v>

4457
02:04:00.080 --> 02:04:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I think you're doing this podcast has helped shape that window.</v>

4458
02:04:03.190 --> 02:04:06.980
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] when that window that those ideas I've always sort of had somewhere</v>

4459
02:04:06.981 --> 02:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>in the back of my mind and then slowly reinforced by other people that have</v>

4460
02:04:10.031 --> 02:04:12.980
<v Speaker 1>meant that shared or and even more evolved version of that idea.</v>

4461
02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>But doing this podcast,</v>

4462
02:04:14.300 --> 02:04:15.620
<v Speaker 1>we're running into so many nice people,</v>

4463
02:04:15.621 --> 02:04:16.700
<v Speaker 1>so many cool people,</v>

4464
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>so many people that are just genuinely like happy and like,</v>

4465
02:04:19.850 --> 02:04:21.110
<v Speaker 1>like if you were my neighbor,</v>

4466
02:04:21.230 --> 02:04:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you know that that would be a beautiful thing.</v>

4467
02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Like if you are my neighbor and he was one of my other neighbors,</v>

4468
02:04:25.730 --> 02:04:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I would want him like two houses down.</v>

4469
02:04:27.831 --> 02:04:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

4470
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:29.570
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker is a screamer,</v>

4471
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:30.501
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I'm saying?</v>

4472
02:04:30.501 --> 02:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Like like to have a real community like that.</v>

4473
02:04:33.681 --> 02:04:37.650
<v Speaker 1>If you really look at it like if everybody was like the f your favorite people,</v>

4474
02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:39.600
<v Speaker 1>boy the world would be fucking amazing.</v>

4475
02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:42.480
<v Speaker 1>The world would just be a bunch of people being friendly with each other,</v>

4476
02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:43.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4477
02:04:43.081 --> 02:04:44.100
<v Speaker 1>exchanging things,</v>

4478
02:04:44.101 --> 02:04:44.761
<v Speaker 1>doing work,</v>

4479
02:04:44.761 --> 02:04:45.521
<v Speaker 1>doing whatever the fuck you,</v>

4480
02:04:45.521 --> 02:04:45.961
<v Speaker 1>you have to do,</v>

4481
02:04:45.961 --> 02:04:47.400
<v Speaker 1>you pay me for this and I do that for you.</v>

4482
02:04:47.401 --> 02:04:49.020
<v Speaker 1>But if everybody was,</v>

4483
02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>if that is kind of be a way where at least on a mass scale that that can be the</v>

4484
02:04:54.811 --> 02:04:55.920
<v Speaker 1>majority of people.</v>

4485
02:04:56.430 --> 02:04:57.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that.</v>

4486
02:04:57.541 --> 02:04:58.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not possible.</v>

4487
02:04:58.740 --> 02:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's inhibited by finances.</v>

4488
02:05:01.081 --> 02:05:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's inhibited by resources.</v>

4489
02:05:03.090 --> 02:05:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's inhibited by people understanding that they can live a different</v>

4490
02:05:06.121 --> 02:05:06.954
<v Speaker 1>kind of life.</v>

4491
02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's where something like a guy like you talking out about it and</v>

4492
02:05:11.581 --> 02:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>a guy like you expressing your ideas.</v>

4493
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Like some kid right now is a big Everlast fan is in his car and he's,</v>

4494
02:05:16.891 --> 02:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4495
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:20.850
<v Speaker 1>listening to this and he's hearing your take on things and maybe he'll pick up a</v>

4496
02:05:20.851 --> 02:05:21.601
<v Speaker 1>book on religion.</v>

4497
02:05:21.601 --> 02:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he'll pick up a book on philosophy.</v>

4498
02:05:23.281 --> 02:05:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he'll,</v>

4499
02:05:23.970 --> 02:05:24.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4500
02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:29.150
<v Speaker 1>maybe he'll stop one pattern of thinking and introduce himself to a couple of</v>

4501
02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:32.040
<v Speaker 1>other patterns and those in turn will shape the future of his thinking.</v>

4502
02:05:33.190 --> 02:05:33.341
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4503
02:05:33.341 --> 02:05:34.174
<v Speaker 6>don't be like me.</v>

4504
02:05:34.390 --> 02:05:34.721
<v Speaker 6>Dot.</v>

4505
02:05:34.721 --> 02:05:35.554
<v Speaker 6>Full Shit.</v>

4506
02:05:36.280 --> 02:05:37.960
<v Speaker 6>But you weren't,</v>

4507
02:05:37.961 --> 02:05:38.231
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>

4508
02:05:38.231 --> 02:05:39.490
<v Speaker 6>you wouldn't be making this,</v>

4509
02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:42.070
<v Speaker 6>this beautiful dark music man.</v>

4510
02:05:42.550 --> 02:05:45.190
<v Speaker 6>You know that this is something I love about that man.</v>

4511
02:05:45.340 --> 02:05:46.270
<v Speaker 6>What does that song,</v>

4512
02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:46.891
<v Speaker 6>what was the,</v>

4513
02:05:46.891 --> 02:05:47.010
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4514
02:05:47.010 --> 02:05:48.130
<v Speaker 6>the song that you played,</v>

4515
02:05:48.430 --> 02:05:49.263
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4516
02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.130
<v Speaker 6>the last time you were here,</v>

4517
02:05:51.131 --> 02:05:52.260
<v Speaker 6>how many different songs did you play?</v>

4518
02:05:52.261 --> 02:05:53.530
<v Speaker 6>The American girl,</v>

4519
02:05:54.160 --> 02:05:55.060
<v Speaker 6>Miss America.</v>

4520
02:05:55.090 --> 02:05:57.010
<v Speaker 6>Miss America has that little Miss America.</v>

4521
02:05:57.070 --> 02:05:58.480
<v Speaker 6>God Damn Son,</v>

4522
02:05:58.870 --> 02:06:00.070
<v Speaker 6>I can't think like that.</v>

4523
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:01.223
<v Speaker 6>I'll start crying.</v>

4524
02:06:01.720 --> 02:06:02.111
<v Speaker 6>I can't,</v>

4525
02:06:02.111 --> 02:06:03.280
<v Speaker 6>I could never write something like that.</v>

4526
02:06:03.281 --> 02:06:04.114
<v Speaker 6>I would just start crying.</v>

4527
02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:05.470
<v Speaker 6>But I love hearing it,</v>

4528
02:06:05.471 --> 02:06:05.891
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4529
02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:06.270
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4530
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:08.620
<v Speaker 6>well that's kind of where I take it about is what makes me,</v>

4531
02:06:08.621 --> 02:06:09.070
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

4532
02:06:09.070 --> 02:06:10.060
<v Speaker 6>when I'm writing it,</v>

4533
02:06:10.061 --> 02:06:10.510
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4534
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:11.291
<v Speaker 6>after it's written,</v>

4535
02:06:11.291 --> 02:06:11.501
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4536
02:06:11.501 --> 02:06:12.370
<v Speaker 6>and I can perform it,</v>

4537
02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:13.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4538
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:14.710
<v Speaker 6>I don't get as emotional,</v>

4539
02:06:14.711 --> 02:06:16.600
<v Speaker 6>but that's what I try and do.</v>

4540
02:06:16.601 --> 02:06:18.280
<v Speaker 6>I try and make myself upset a little bit.</v>

4541
02:06:18.281 --> 02:06:20.870
<v Speaker 6>Like feel something because I'm,</v>

4542
02:06:20.871 --> 02:06:21.551
<v Speaker 6>I'm hard.</v>

4543
02:06:21.551 --> 02:06:22.031
<v Speaker 6>Honestly.</v>

4544
02:06:22.031 --> 02:06:22.864
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

4545
02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:24.040
<v Speaker 6>I'm hard to get to,</v>

4546
02:06:24.880 --> 02:06:25.211
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4547
02:06:25.211 --> 02:06:26.044
<v Speaker 6>react.</v>

4548
02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:27.160
<v Speaker 6>You're a big teddy bear.</v>

4549
02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:28.781
<v Speaker 6>Probably truth,</v>

4550
02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:30.220
<v Speaker 6>but it's hard to get past the,</v>

4551
02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:30.560
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

4552
02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:31.390
<v Speaker 6>the for,</v>

4553
02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:31.541
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

4554
02:06:31.541 --> 02:06:32.980
<v Speaker 6>you just dealt with a lot of Douche.</v>

4555
02:06:32.981 --> 02:06:34.600
<v Speaker 6>Douchebags it's normal.</v>

4556
02:06:34.780 --> 02:06:35.613
<v Speaker 6>It's normal,</v>

4557
02:06:36.890 --> 02:06:37.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4558
02:06:37.150 --> 02:06:38.200
<v Speaker 6>search reason,</v>

4559
02:06:38.201 --> 02:06:39.010
<v Speaker 6>life say no,</v>

4560
02:06:39.010 --> 02:06:39.450
<v Speaker 6>you've,</v>

4561
02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:39.790
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4562
02:06:39.790 --> 02:06:40.980
<v Speaker 6>you're about to sing right there.</v>

4563
02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:41.833
<v Speaker 6>Those,</v>

4564
02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.730
<v Speaker 6>let's get to have a nub and surgeries and alive.</v>

4565
02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.170
<v Speaker 6>Go right into sampling.</v>

4566
02:06:48.220 --> 02:06:48.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4567
02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:49.241
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

4568
02:06:49.241 --> 02:06:51.700
<v Speaker 6>But ultimately you're a nice guy.</v>

4569
02:06:51.790 --> 02:06:52.090
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4570
02:06:52.090 --> 02:06:52.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4571
02:06:52.690 --> 02:06:53.830
<v Speaker 6>I'd like to think so.</v>

4572
02:06:53.930 --> 02:06:54.150
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4573
02:06:54.150 --> 02:06:54.881
<v Speaker 6>He's a nice guy.</v>

4574
02:06:54.881 --> 02:06:55.301
<v Speaker 6>You're fun,</v>

4575
02:06:55.301 --> 02:06:56.100
<v Speaker 6>you're fun to be around.</v>

4576
02:06:56.100 --> 02:06:57.490
<v Speaker 6>And if you use your blinker,</v>

4577
02:06:58.660 --> 02:06:59.493
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

4578
02:07:00.670 --> 02:07:01.210
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

4579
02:07:01.210 --> 02:07:02.290
<v Speaker 6>There's nothing wrong with that,</v>

4580
02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:07.210
<v Speaker 6>but you've also dealt with a lot of Douche bags were we live in douchebag</v>

4581
02:07:07.330 --> 02:07:09.500
<v Speaker 6>central and we work amongst douchebag.</v>

4582
02:07:09.550 --> 02:07:10.060
<v Speaker 6>Fucking,</v>

4583
02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:10.320
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4584
02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:11.140
<v Speaker 6>in the Douche bag.</v>

4585
02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:11.380
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

4586
02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:12.370
<v Speaker 6>Industry there is,</v>

4587
02:07:12.371 --> 02:07:12.740
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4588
02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:13.531
<v Speaker 6>people will never know.</v>

4589
02:07:13.531 --> 02:07:13.690
<v Speaker 6>There's</v>

4590
02:07:13.690 --> 02:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>dental douchey.</v>

4591
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:15.190
<v Speaker 1>It can possibly be.</v>

4592
02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:16.540
<v Speaker 1>And especially the music business.</v>

4593
02:07:16.541 --> 02:07:17.860
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably the Douchey,</v>

4594
02:07:17.861 --> 02:07:22.510
<v Speaker 1>just how to all the potential running into dickheads running any musicians.</v>

4595
02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Like you got a lot of brilliant,</v>

4596
02:07:24.251 --> 02:07:25.240
<v Speaker 1>beautiful people out there,</v>

4597
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:29.110
<v Speaker 1>but God damn things way worse than musicians and Tish bags.</v>

4598
02:07:29.111 --> 02:07:29.261
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4599
02:07:29.261 --> 02:07:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Cause even a shitty musician is actually probably somewhat decent.</v>

4600
02:07:32.831 --> 02:07:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Has shitty actors this fucking,</v>

4601
02:07:34.810 --> 02:07:35.470
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

4602
02:07:35.470 --> 02:07:36.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point</v>

4603
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:39.160
<v Speaker 6>because most actors are gross to begin with and you have a shitty went on top of</v>

4604
02:07:39.161 --> 02:07:39.300
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

4605
02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:40.150
<v Speaker 6>I would say they're pretty close.</v>

4606
02:07:40.300 --> 02:07:41.770
<v Speaker 6>I've met a lot of douchey musicians,</v>

4607
02:07:42.070 --> 02:07:42.611
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>

4608
02:07:42.611 --> 02:07:44.410
<v Speaker 6>I think ultimately you're probably right.</v>

4609
02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:45.010
<v Speaker 6>I think men do.</v>

4610
02:07:45.010 --> 02:07:46.930
<v Speaker 6>Musicians requires more discipline to,</v>

4611
02:07:47.730 --> 02:07:48.220
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4612
02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:48.550
<v Speaker 6>does it?</v>

4613
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:49.383
<v Speaker 6>You have to actually,</v>

4614
02:07:49.660 --> 02:07:50.830
<v Speaker 6>especially if you play an instrument,</v>

4615
02:07:51.070 --> 02:07:52.560
<v Speaker 6>you have to actually learn discipline.</v>

4616
02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:53.473
<v Speaker 6>You got to practice.</v>

4617
02:07:53.650 --> 02:07:53.980
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4618
02:07:53.980 --> 02:07:54.820
<v Speaker 6>that's a big thing.</v>

4619
02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:56.260
<v Speaker 6>Answers on best act is shit.</v>

4620
02:07:56.450 --> 02:07:57.283
<v Speaker 6>Investment in time.</v>

4621
02:07:57.820 --> 02:08:01.060
<v Speaker 6>Acting as easy as fuck too and they like to pretend it's really difficult.</v>

4622
02:08:01.570 --> 02:08:02.800
<v Speaker 6>It's easy as well.</v>

4623
02:08:02.801 --> 02:08:04.780
<v Speaker 6>I think there's a level of it that's hard,</v>

4624
02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:05.081
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4625
02:08:05.081 --> 02:08:06.280
<v Speaker 6>I mean Daniel Day Lewis,</v>

4626
02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:10.030
<v Speaker 6>the general most things done in the acting world are relatively easy.</v>

4627
02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:12.520
<v Speaker 6>It's not like playing guitar and singing at the same time.</v>

4628
02:08:12.521 --> 02:08:13.870
<v Speaker 6>That's tricky as fuck isn't it?</v>

4629
02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:17.500
<v Speaker 6>And actually it took a long time for me to be able to do both.</v>

4630
02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:17.900
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4631
02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:18.581
<v Speaker 6>watch you do it.</v>

4632
02:08:18.581 --> 02:08:18.820
<v Speaker 6>And I'm,</v>

4633
02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:19.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

4634
02:08:19.110 --> 02:08:19.311
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

4635
02:08:19.311 --> 02:08:21.360
<v Speaker 6>I'm perplexed by the dam,</v>

4636
02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:22.450
<v Speaker 6>but the one can,</v>

4637
02:08:22.490 --> 02:08:22.811
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4638
02:08:22.811 --> 02:08:23.950
<v Speaker 6>the one thing that's bad is,</v>

4639
02:08:23.951 --> 02:08:24.491
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>

4640
02:08:24.491 --> 02:08:25.720
<v Speaker 6>if that one kink in the road,</v>

4641
02:08:26.390 --> 02:08:27.370
<v Speaker 6>it's a train wreck,</v>

4642
02:08:27.371 --> 02:08:27.641
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

4643
02:08:27.641 --> 02:08:30.510
<v Speaker 6>It's like I should have never opened my eyes on that one.</v>

4644
02:08:30.530 --> 02:08:32.020
<v Speaker 6>Well that's different than a joke.</v>

4645
02:08:32.080 --> 02:08:32.381
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4646
02:08:32.381 --> 02:08:32.771
<v Speaker 6>a joke.</v>

4647
02:08:32.771 --> 02:08:35.920
<v Speaker 6>You could fuck up in the middle of it and sorta like re rail it and it'd be,</v>

4648
02:08:35.921 --> 02:08:39.430
<v Speaker 6>and you even go on a tangent about the fuck up and you're okay,</v>

4649
02:08:39.431 --> 02:08:40.630
<v Speaker 6>but we'll not get set on me.</v>

4650
02:08:40.631 --> 02:08:42.900
<v Speaker 6>It's all pictures and one kind of cross circuit.</v>

4651
02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:44.540
<v Speaker 6>And so honestly what happened was,</v>

4652
02:08:44.541 --> 02:08:49.150
<v Speaker 6>is my hand started playing one song and I was saying words from another and then</v>

4653
02:08:49.151 --> 02:08:49.550
<v Speaker 6>it was all,</v>

4654
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:51.970
<v Speaker 6>it was like just jumbled garbage.</v>

4655
02:08:52.450 --> 02:08:56.470
<v Speaker 6>How would we really be fascinated if someone who was a memory expert could talk</v>

4656
02:08:56.471 --> 02:08:57.700
<v Speaker 6>to you about,</v>

4657
02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:58.060
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

4658
02:08:58.060 --> 02:09:00.020
<v Speaker 6>how you organize thoughts like how you,</v>

4659
02:09:00.090 --> 02:09:00.401
<v Speaker 6>how many,</v>

4660
02:09:00.401 --> 02:09:01.150
<v Speaker 6>how you memorize things.</v>

4661
02:09:01.150 --> 02:09:02.980
<v Speaker 6>I bet people could learn a lot because you're,</v>

4662
02:09:03.140 --> 02:09:03.880
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

4663
02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:04.121
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

4664
02:09:04.121 --> 02:09:05.860
<v Speaker 6>you've got and just not just words,</v>

4665
02:09:06.070 --> 02:09:10.660
<v Speaker 6>you got words that correspond to Melanie's correspond to musical notes and you</v>

4666
02:09:10.661 --> 02:09:13.870
<v Speaker 6>have it all like arrange and I'm sure you've morphed it.</v>

4667
02:09:13.871 --> 02:09:17.950
<v Speaker 6>So you've probably had several versions of each song as if sort of evolved</v>

4668
02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:19.030
<v Speaker 6>inside your head.</v>

4669
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.930
<v Speaker 6>I bet that would be.</v>

4670
02:09:19.930 --> 02:09:21.790
<v Speaker 6>How many fucking songs do you have in your head right now?</v>

4671
02:09:22.450 --> 02:09:24.130
<v Speaker 6>Like how many songs could you reliably play?</v>

4672
02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:30.090
<v Speaker 6>A hundred just mean without like rehearsing like without a company and just you?</v>

4673
02:09:32.170 --> 02:09:32.351
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

4674
02:09:32.351 --> 02:09:34.250
<v Speaker 6>I kind of eliminate all the rap songs if you,</v>

4675
02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:35.860
<v Speaker 6>cause that wouldn't be playing too.</v>

4676
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:37.143
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

4677
02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:38.093
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

4678
02:09:38.710 --> 02:09:41.410
<v Speaker 6>probably most songs off of most of my records if I,</v>

4679
02:09:41.530 --> 02:09:42.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4680
02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:42.873
<v Speaker 6>what's the number?</v>

4681
02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:47.830
<v Speaker 6>60 60 or 60 think about all that shit.</v>

4682
02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:49.240
<v Speaker 6>60 Times what?</v>

4683
02:09:49.241 --> 02:09:52.510
<v Speaker 6>Five minutes for four minutes.</v>

4684
02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.700
<v Speaker 6>That's a lot of fucking shit to memorize,</v>

4685
02:09:54.701 --> 02:09:55.534
<v Speaker 6>son.</v>

4686
02:09:55.660 --> 02:09:56.920
<v Speaker 6>A lot of shit inside your head.</v>

4687
02:09:56.921 --> 02:09:59.330
<v Speaker 6>Just spinning around and you're calling upon another,</v>

4688
02:09:59.331 --> 02:09:59.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

4689
02:09:59.690 --> 02:10:03.490
<v Speaker 6>three albums of wraps and stuff I've never even used yet.</v>

4690
02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:04.540
<v Speaker 6>You know.</v>

4691
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.630
<v Speaker 6>Do you think you get to bust those out as well or would you need to a wrap</v>

4692
02:10:07.631 --> 02:10:08.170
<v Speaker 6>mindset?</v>

4693
02:10:08.170 --> 02:10:09.000
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

4694
02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.510
<v Speaker 6>I like the classics.</v>

4695
02:10:10.511 --> 02:10:11.344
<v Speaker 6>I could bust out.</v>

4696

4755
02:11:46.861 --> 02:11:48.540

02:11:57.480 --> 02:11:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I only drink coke out of a glass bottle.</v>

4766
02:11:59.610 --> 02:12:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Mexican coke.</v>

4767
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:00.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4768
02:12:00.750 --> 02:12:01.740
<v Speaker 3>This is what I tell people.</v>

4769
02:12:01.741 --> 02:12:02.580
<v Speaker 3>Think about it this way.</v>

4770
02:12:02.610 --> 02:12:03.130
<v Speaker 3>If you want,</v>

4771
02:12:03.130 --> 02:12:04.920
<v Speaker 3>they make American coax the little sorry,</v>

4772
02:12:04.921 --> 02:12:06.680
<v Speaker 3>but the little eight ounce or Americans learn it.</v>

4773
02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:07.740
<v Speaker 3>You can find Mexican ones,</v>

4774
02:12:07.741 --> 02:12:09.630
<v Speaker 3>but I'll drink the little American ones too.</v>

4775
02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:10.440
<v Speaker 3>If you want it.</v>

4776
02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:13.710
<v Speaker 3>You really change what you drink and you really want to drink a lot of water.</v>

4777
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:17.490
<v Speaker 3>Just think about how delicious water would be if it was rare as fuck.</v>

4778
02:12:17.910 --> 02:12:19.210
<v Speaker 3>If water was difficult to come.</v>

4779
02:12:19.211 --> 02:12:19.771
<v Speaker 3>Most delicious.</v>

4780
02:12:19.771 --> 02:12:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Now I love ice.</v>

4781
02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:21.930

4787
02:12:24.250 --> 02:12:28.440
<v Speaker 3>There's that fucking monster in my brain that tells you to get that Coca Cola</v>

4795
02:12:48.090 --> 02:12:48.780
<v Speaker 3>in it.</v>

4796
02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:49.600
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

4797
02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:50.433
<v Speaker 3>There's sodium in it.</v>

4798
02:12:50.550 --> 02:12:50.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

4799
02:12:50.761 --> 02:12:51.900

4813
02:13:11.521 --> 02:13:13.160
<v Speaker 3>little ones because they stopped selling.</v>

<v Speaker 3>with coke and put my my refrigerator cause I'm a psycho.</v>

4855
02:14:16.801 --> 02:14:18.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's all we use now in America.</v>

02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you know the Coca Cola is the number one like the,</v>

<v Speaker 1>as far as like important.</v>

4858
02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Like who who takes cocaine in this country?</v>

4859
02:14:24.850 --> 02:14:25.683
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola,</v>

<v Speaker 1>his medical cocaine and they get medical cocaine from processing the coca leaves</v>

4862
02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:32.220
<v Speaker 1>that they used to make Coca Cola.</v>

4863
02:14:32.610 --> 02:14:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Like they're connected with medical costs and not know that one of the active</v>

4864
02:14:36.721 --> 02:14:38.140
<v Speaker 1>ingredients in Coca Cola,</v>

4865
02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:38.870
<v Speaker 1>they're sanctioned.</v>

4866
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Like they were part of all these sanctioned assassinations and Southwire,</v>

4867
02:14:42.660 --> 02:14:43.410

<v Speaker 1>I haven't dot com no joke.</v>

4870
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Nicole's evil and,</v>

02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:50.000
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

4873
02:14:50.970 --> 02:14:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called the Coca Cola files or the Coca Cola cases.</v>

4874
02:14:54.250 --> 02:14:56.940
<v Speaker 1>And it's about how their involvement in some like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4876
02:14:57.241 --> 02:15:00.270
<v Speaker 1>nefarious activities down there in South America.</v>

4877
02:15:00.570 --> 02:15:00.811
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4878
02:15:00.811 --> 02:15:02.780
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to be a coke,</v>

4879
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:05.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprised I didn't hear about that inside that little documentary.</v>

4880
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:07.461
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

4881
02:15:07.461 --> 02:15:07.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4882
02:15:07.711 --> 02:15:08.850
<v Speaker 1>they don't sell coke,</v>

4883
02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:10.230
<v Speaker 1>but they do sell to,</v>

4884
02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:15.000
<v Speaker 1>they take the process of converting whatever the fuck is,</v>

4885
02:15:15.001 --> 02:15:15.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4886
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:18.360
<v Speaker 1>in the coca leaves into some sort of a flavonoid,</v>

4887
02:15:18.650 --> 02:15:20.250
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a plant based,</v>

4888
02:15:20.251 --> 02:15:21.084
<v Speaker 1>a taste.</v>

4889
02:15:21.300 --> 02:15:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And they take that and it's one of the ingredients of coke that makes it taste</v>

4890
02:15:24.571 --> 02:15:24.931
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

4891
02:15:24.931 --> 02:15:26.910
<v Speaker 1>And for the longest time was actually cocaine.</v>

4892
02:15:26.970 --> 02:15:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

4893
02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:27.961
<v Speaker 1>Back original.</v>

4894
02:15:27.961 --> 02:15:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola was cocaine.</v>

4895
02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:32.850
<v Speaker 1>But when the process that they use to make cocaine,</v>

4896
02:15:33.340 --> 02:15:34.173
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4897
02:15:34.500 --> 02:15:35.880
<v Speaker 1>The actual process today,</v>

4898
02:15:35.881 --> 02:15:37.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is in 2013,</v>

4899
02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:37.801
<v Speaker 1>they used to make,</v>

4900
02:15:37.801 --> 02:15:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola involves cocaine.</v>

4901
02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:41.250
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give you a cocaine high,</v>

4902
02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:44.850
<v Speaker 1>but there's a flavor aspect of it that actually comes from the coca plant.</v>

4903
02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4904
02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:48.810
<v Speaker 1>And then they take that shit and they sell it and they process it and they take</v>

4905
02:15:48.811 --> 02:15:52.620
<v Speaker 1>the cocaine out of it and make medical cost counties because gang of shit used</v>

<v Speaker 6>What's so unfair?</v>

5096
02:20:42.501 --> 02:20:43.850
<v Speaker 6>If you know the history of people too.</v>

5097
02:20:43.851 --> 02:20:47.840
<v Speaker 6>It's not like they didn't know that people have been like Roos by charlatans,</v>

5098
02:20:48.050 --> 02:20:50.660
<v Speaker 6>all these fucking late night preachers that are trying to get people to donate</v>

5099
02:20:50.661 --> 02:20:50.841
<v Speaker 6>money.</v>

5100
02:20:50.841 --> 02:20:52.310
<v Speaker 6>They've been doing it for years and years and years.</v>

5101
02:20:52.460 --> 02:20:52.880
<v Speaker 6>They didn't,</v>

5102
02:20:52.880 --> 02:20:55.130
<v Speaker 6>they already knew that there was a certain percentage of the population that</v>

5103
02:20:55.131 --> 02:20:57.020
<v Speaker 6>were like super easily manipulated.</v>

5104
02:20:57.230 --> 02:21:00.010
<v Speaker 6>So to make them responsible for,</v>

5105
02:21:00.011 --> 02:21:00.500
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

5106
02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:04.050
<v Speaker 6>their own judgment and having a commercial on that,</v>

5107
02:21:04.051 --> 02:21:05.090
<v Speaker 6>selling prescription drugs,</v>

5108
02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:06.410
<v Speaker 6>that's really ridiculous.</v>

5109
02:21:06.780 --> 02:21:10.280
<v Speaker 6>That's not just the guys you got now you got guys coming in asking for stuff and</v>

5110
02:21:10.281 --> 02:21:11.930
<v Speaker 6>how many doctors are just sleazebags.</v>

5111
02:21:11.931 --> 02:21:12.111
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5112
02:21:12.111 --> 02:21:14.780
<v Speaker 6>we've learned how many doctors used to be when we were young.</v>

5113
02:21:14.781 --> 02:21:15.141
<v Speaker 6>That was a,</v>

5114
02:21:15.141 --> 02:21:15.681
<v Speaker 6>somebody like,</v>

5115

5117
02:21:17.031 --> 02:21:17.541
<v Speaker 6>firemen,</v>

5118
02:21:17.541 --> 02:21:18.021
<v Speaker 6>doctors,</v>

5119
02:21:18.021 --> 02:21:18.980
<v Speaker 6>these are good people.</v>

5120
02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:19.521
<v Speaker 6>We know.</v>

5121
02:21:19.521 --> 02:21:20.440
<v Speaker 6>Now that's not true.</v>

5122
02:21:20.441 --> 02:21:21.271
<v Speaker 6>There are people there,</v>

5123
02:21:21.271 --> 02:21:23.330
<v Speaker 6>they're just as dirty and rotten as everybody else.</v>

5124
02:21:23.331 --> 02:21:24.230
<v Speaker 6>So how many of them are like,</v>

5125
02:21:24.231 --> 02:21:24.411
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

5126
02:21:24.411 --> 02:21:24.651
<v Speaker 6>sure,</v>

5127
02:21:24.651 --> 02:21:26.270
<v Speaker 6>I'll prescribe you all that shit.</v>

5128
02:21:26.330 --> 02:21:26.481
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

5129
02:21:26.481 --> 02:21:27.200
<v Speaker 6>it's happening.</v>

5130
02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:27.730
<v Speaker 6>For sure.</v>

5131
02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:28.551
<v Speaker 6>I could go out right now,</v>

5132
02:21:28.551 --> 02:21:30.050
<v Speaker 6>legitimately right now with,</v>

5133
02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:30.890
<v Speaker 6>by the end of,</v>

5134
02:21:30.890 --> 02:21:31.101
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

5135
02:21:31.101 --> 02:21:31.761
<v Speaker 6>it's probably late today,</v>

5136
02:21:31.761 --> 02:21:34.580
<v Speaker 6>but by the end of day tomorrow I can have pri five prescriptions for painkillers</v>

5137
02:21:34.581 --> 02:21:35.414
<v Speaker 6>if I really want them.</v>

5138
02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:36.410
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

5139
02:21:36.410 --> 02:21:38.510
<v Speaker 6>today in California there's a database,</v>

5140
02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:41.180
<v Speaker 6>so you could probably go to different doctors and maybe get different things</v>

5141
02:21:41.181 --> 02:21:41.721
<v Speaker 6>prescribed.</v>

5142
02:21:41.721 --> 02:21:42.170
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

5143
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:42.381
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

5144
02:21:42.381 --> 02:21:43.220
<v Speaker 6>Not the same one.</v>

5145
02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:44.391
<v Speaker 6>But in Florida,</v>

5146
02:21:44.391 --> 02:21:45.440
<v Speaker 6>they don't have a database.</v>

5147
02:21:45.441 --> 02:21:45.681
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

5148
02:21:45.681 --> 02:21:46.700
<v Speaker 6>they might've changed it now,</v>

5149
02:21:46.701 --> 02:21:47.420
<v Speaker 6>but they had that,</v>

5150
02:21:47.420 --> 02:21:48.141
<v Speaker 6>that show,</v>

5151
02:21:48.141 --> 02:21:50.780
<v Speaker 6>the oxycontin express that they aired.</v>

5152
02:21:50.781 --> 02:21:50.961
<v Speaker 6>If you,</v>

5153
02:21:50.961 --> 02:21:52.640
<v Speaker 6>you can just Google that online,</v>

5154
02:21:52.641 --> 02:21:53.474
<v Speaker 6>you can watch it.</v>

5155
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.781
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

5156
02:21:53.781 --> 02:21:54.614
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

5157
02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:54.860
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

5158
02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:55.670
<v Speaker 6>what does that,</v>

5159
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:57.200
<v Speaker 6>I think it was on true TV,</v>

5160
02:21:57.350 --> 02:21:58.071
<v Speaker 6>but either way,</v>

5161
02:21:58.071 --> 02:22:01.520
<v Speaker 6>whatever it was on the Oxycontin Express van guard,</v>

5162
02:22:01.521 --> 02:22:04.280
<v Speaker 6>that was the show they went and they showed how you could go to Florida.</v>

5163
02:22:04.281 --> 02:22:05.091
<v Speaker 6>You can go to a doctor,</v>

5164
02:22:05.091 --> 02:22:05.361
<v Speaker 6>say,</v>

5165
02:22:05.361 --> 02:22:06.051
<v Speaker 6>oh my back hurts.</v>

5166
02:22:06.051 --> 02:22:08.150
<v Speaker 6>They give you a prescription and you go down the street to another doctor.</v>

5167
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:09.800
<v Speaker 6>He gives you a prescription for the same shit.</v>

5168
02:22:10.010 --> 02:22:11.150
<v Speaker 6>Nobody talks to anybody.</v>

5169
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:11.690
<v Speaker 6>They don't,</v>

5170
02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:13.130
<v Speaker 6>there's not a database that they can say,</v>

5171
02:22:13.131 --> 02:22:14.000
<v Speaker 6>hey Mr. Wilson,</v>

5172
02:22:14.001 --> 02:22:18.590
<v Speaker 6>I see you've had 10,000 oxycontin prescriptions from different doctors this</v>

5173
02:22:18.590 --> 02:22:18.980
<v Speaker 6>year.</v>

5174
02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:20.000
<v Speaker 6>So because of that,</v>

5175
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:23.960
<v Speaker 6>Florida sells more oxycontin then the whole country,</v>

5176
02:22:24.230 --> 02:22:26.130
<v Speaker 6>like literally think that the numbers</v>

5177
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:30.180
<v Speaker 1>for how much the part of your whole explanation of Florida's crazy.</v>

5178
02:22:30.181 --> 02:22:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Now it's absolutely,</v>

5179
02:22:31.680 --> 02:22:34.020
<v Speaker 1>let me make sure that that's true because someone told me that,</v>

5180
02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:34.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5181
02:22:34.441 --> 02:22:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Florida uses more oxy than the whole country.</v>

5182
02:22:41.450 --> 02:22:42.283
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5183
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a doubt in my mind,</v>

5184
02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:45.131
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

5185
02:22:45.131 --> 02:22:45.671
<v Speaker 1>when he thinks that,</v>

5186
02:22:45.671 --> 02:22:46.504
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

5187
02:22:46.570 --> 02:22:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5188
02:22:46.900 --> 02:22:47.560
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

5189
02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:48.393
<v Speaker 1>I think it's right.</v>

5190
02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:50.593
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

5191
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5192
02:22:51.040 --> 02:22:51.930
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound wrong.</v>

5193
02:22:52.050 --> 02:22:52.950
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't sound wrong.</v>

5194
02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5195
02:22:53.850 --> 02:22:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Well either way I'll,</v>

5196
02:22:55.330 --> 02:22:55.981
<v Speaker 1>I'll look for it.</v>

5197
02:22:55.981 --> 02:22:56.814
<v Speaker 1>While we're talking,</v>

5198
02:22:56.820 --> 02:22:57.361
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

5199
02:22:57.361 --> 02:22:57.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5200
02:22:57.930 --> 02:23:01.620
<v Speaker 1>the reality is that there's a lot of fucking people that take that shit and</v>

5201
02:23:01.621 --> 02:23:02.400
<v Speaker 1>they're gone.</v>

5202
02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:02.711
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5203
02:23:02.711 --> 02:23:03.000
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

5204
02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:03.750
<v Speaker 1>it's opiate.</v>

5205
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:06.390
<v Speaker 1>It's really dangerously addictive and they just,</v>

5206
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:08.820
<v Speaker 1>they just toss and I never took it.</v>

5207
02:23:08.910 --> 02:23:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Somebody gave me some once and I just,</v>

5208
02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:12.030
<v Speaker 1>they actually frightened me.</v>

5209
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:15.000
<v Speaker 1>I threw them away because I knew so many people that just got caught out there</v>

5210
02:23:15.001 --> 02:23:15.990
<v Speaker 1>so quickly on them.</v>

5211
02:23:16.020 --> 02:23:16.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5212
02:23:16.291 --> 02:23:17.124
<v Speaker 1>you ready for this?</v>

5213
02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:18.240
<v Speaker 1>In Florida alone,</v>

5214
02:23:18.241 --> 02:23:23.000
<v Speaker 1>almost 3000 people died of an overdose in 2009.</v>

5215
02:23:23.010 --> 02:23:23.843
<v Speaker 1>2010.</v>

5216
02:23:24.450 --> 02:23:27.540
<v Speaker 1>The majority of these people had legal prescriptions,</v>

5217
02:23:27.660 --> 02:23:28.261
<v Speaker 1>medications,</v>

5218
02:23:28.261 --> 02:23:29.700
<v Speaker 1>and their systems at the time of death.</v>

5219
02:23:30.450 --> 02:23:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

5220

5223
02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:37.950

<v Speaker 1>It's nine 11 and it keeps going.</v>

5231
02:23:45.060 --> 02:23:49.650
<v Speaker 1>People just dropping this show was really scary because one of the guys on the</v>

02:23:49.921 --> 02:23:53.550
<v Speaker 1>his wife had died of an overdose and he got high before you called the cops.</v>

5234
02:23:54.150 --> 02:23:55.260
<v Speaker 1>His wife was lying next to him,</v>

5235
02:23:55.261 --> 02:23:58.680
<v Speaker 1>cold and blue and this motherfucker got high before he called the ambulance.</v>

5236
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

5237
02:23:59.670 --> 02:24:00.840
<v Speaker 1>That's how crazy it is.</v>

5238
02:24:00.920 --> 02:24:01.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5239
02:24:01.380 --> 02:24:02.940
<v Speaker 1>That shit honestly scared me.</v>

5240
02:24:03.060 --> 02:24:03.960
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying.</v>

5241
02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I had a period where I was like heavy and they're like taking like biking in and</v>

5242
02:24:06.940 --> 02:24:07.950
<v Speaker 1>drinking a few whiskeys.</v>

5243
02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:08.813
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:09.870
<v Speaker 1>why don't you like to do that?</v>

5245
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:11.140
<v Speaker 1>What does that feeling made me feel.</v>

5246
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:16.230
<v Speaker 3>I would take like half a viking and my rule was a half a Vicodin</v>

5247
02:24:16.770 --> 02:24:18.630
<v Speaker 1>and then I can have a few whiskeys and it'd be like,</v>

5248
02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:20.130
<v Speaker 1>it'd be almost the same feeling as that,</v>

5249
02:24:20.460 --> 02:24:21.300
<v Speaker 1>that crop syrup.</v>

02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:14.650
<v Speaker 6>I mean it never steered me away.</v>

5409
02:28:14.651 --> 02:28:16.680
<v Speaker 6>I was always drinking,</v>

5410
02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:18.220
<v Speaker 6>but I just never,</v>

5411
02:28:18.430 --> 02:28:19.720
<v Speaker 6>I never drank by myself.</v>

5412
02:28:19.721 --> 02:28:21.040
<v Speaker 6>It was always early on in my life.</v>

5413
02:28:21.050 --> 02:28:22.040
<v Speaker 6>I was very aware of that kind</v>

5414
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:22.371
<v Speaker 3>of stuff.</v>

5415
02:28:22.371 --> 02:28:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Like don't be caught drinking at home.</v>

5416
02:28:23.991 --> 02:28:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Don't drink because you're sad or in a bad mood.</v>

5417
02:28:26.601 --> 02:28:27.890
<v Speaker 3>I know that's not my thing.</v>

5418
02:28:28.470 --> 02:28:28.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5419
02:28:28.880 --> 02:28:30.080
<v Speaker 3>That's never the good mood.</v>

5420
02:28:30.110 --> 02:28:30.980
<v Speaker 3>Like drink it for me,</v>

5421
02:28:30.981 --> 02:28:31.880
<v Speaker 3>it's something I do like,</v>

5422
02:28:31.910 --> 02:28:33.140
<v Speaker 3>oh we're going to go out and have some fun.</v>

5423
02:28:33.410 --> 02:28:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Let's have a few drinks.</v>

5424
02:28:34.820 --> 02:28:37.610
<v Speaker 3>That's cool that you were able to overcome that even though your dad had an</v>

5425
02:28:37.611 --> 02:28:38.070
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

5426
02:28:38.070 --> 02:28:41.330
<v Speaker 3>Because sometimes at that that thing is either psychological but sometimes it's</v>

5427
02:28:41.331 --> 02:28:41.760
<v Speaker 3>genetic,</v>

5428
02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:41.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5429
02:28:41.971 --> 02:28:44.390
<v Speaker 3>but like by the time I hit 1516 I would,</v>

5430
02:28:44.720 --> 02:28:46.610
<v Speaker 3>my routine was like I would when I knew those,</v>

5431
02:28:46.660 --> 02:28:46.941
<v Speaker 3>cause they're,</v>

5432
02:28:46.941 --> 02:28:47.301
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

5433
02:28:47.301 --> 02:28:49.490
<v Speaker 3>it was like it wasn't an every night thing.</v>

5434
02:28:49.491 --> 02:28:49.731
<v Speaker 3>It's about,</v>

5435
02:28:49.731 --> 02:28:50.780
<v Speaker 3>I guess he'd be fine for a long time,</v>

5436
02:28:50.781 --> 02:28:51.920
<v Speaker 3>but when you knew he was on a binge,</v>

5437
02:28:51.921 --> 02:28:56.270
<v Speaker 3>I would stay up every night till either he didn't come home or he came home,</v>

5438
02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:59.720
<v Speaker 3>sit them down and give him some food just to keep it from like fighting.</v>

5439
02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:00.650
<v Speaker 3>And then like one time,</v>

5440
02:29:00.651 --> 02:29:00.771
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5441
02:29:00.771 --> 02:29:01.910
<v Speaker 3>he started trying to fight with my mom,</v>

5442
02:29:01.911 --> 02:29:03.880
<v Speaker 3>but I was saying I was about 1617 and I just,</v>

5443
02:29:03.890 --> 02:29:04.970
<v Speaker 3>that's when I stepped in and</v>

5444
02:29:06.530 --> 02:29:07.011
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

5445
02:29:07.011 --> 02:29:08.660
<v Speaker 3>So we had a fight and you know,</v>

5446
02:29:08.750 --> 02:29:10.160
<v Speaker 3>I woke up on the couch later.</v>

5447
02:29:10.700 --> 02:29:12.530
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was a big construction work in man.</v>

5448
02:29:12.531 --> 02:29:13.250
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

5449
02:29:13.250 --> 02:29:13.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5450
02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:14.630
<v Speaker 3>he wasn't easy to fight,</v>

5451
02:29:14.660 --> 02:29:18.680
<v Speaker 3>but that was the last time flew out to when me and him squared off.</v>

5452
02:29:18.681 --> 02:29:20.200
<v Speaker 3>It was the last time it ever happened to him.</v>

5453
02:29:20.201 --> 02:29:21.080
<v Speaker 3>He never did it again.</v>

5454
02:29:21.290 --> 02:29:23.330
<v Speaker 3>And then they finally split up a little while later.</v>

5455
02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:24.861
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5456
02:29:24.861 --> 02:29:25.850
<v Speaker 3>That's not good man.</v>

5457
02:29:26.210 --> 02:29:29.120
<v Speaker 3>Being around crazy big drunks that can beat the fuck outta here was never</v>

5458
02:29:29.121 --> 02:29:29.954
<v Speaker 3>willing to,</v>

5459
02:29:30.070 --> 02:29:30.903
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

5460
02:29:30.990 --> 02:29:31.960
<v Speaker 3>Before he passed though,</v>

5461
02:29:31.970 --> 02:29:33.080
<v Speaker 3>I think he got it together.</v>

5462
02:29:33.081 --> 02:29:33.750
<v Speaker 3>He was,</v>

5463
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:34.740
<v Speaker 3>he came,</v>

5464
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:35.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5465
02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:36.620
<v Speaker 3>his life lessons were learned,</v>

5466
02:29:36.621 --> 02:29:37.454
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

5467
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.821
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

5468
02:29:37.821 --> 02:29:42.110
<v Speaker 3>the alcohol one is such a fucked up one because it seems some sort of a chemical</v>

5469
02:29:42.111 --> 02:29:43.520
<v Speaker 3>thing goes off and some folks,</v>

5470
02:29:43.521 --> 02:29:45.830
<v Speaker 3>and then he died at 63 I know it shortened his life.</v>

5471
02:29:46.010 --> 02:29:46.580
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>

5472
02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5473
02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:47.870
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about it.</v>

5474
02:29:47.871 --> 02:29:48.530
<v Speaker 3>It's poison.</v>

5475
02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:49.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean it feels good because it's poison.</v>

5476
02:29:50.050 --> 02:29:50.300
<v Speaker 3>Poison.</v>

5477
02:29:50.300 --> 02:29:51.133
<v Speaker 3>You know your shit.</v>

5478
02:29:51.290 --> 02:29:52.750
<v Speaker 3>But Damn,</v>

5479
02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:53.121
<v Speaker 3>it's fun.</v>

5480
02:29:53.121 --> 02:29:54.390
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes whiskeys good.</v>

5481
02:29:55.800 --> 02:29:58.110
<v Speaker 3>And the relief,</v>

5482
02:29:58.150 --> 02:30:02.060
<v Speaker 3>the relief from the burdens of thinking about all the subtle nuances of the</v>

5483
02:30:02.061 --> 02:30:02.570
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

5484
02:30:02.570 --> 02:30:02.871
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

5485
02:30:02.871 --> 02:30:03.591
<v Speaker 3>when did you just like,</v>

5486
02:30:03.591 --> 02:30:04.520
<v Speaker 3>who gives a fuck?</v>

5487
02:30:04.550 --> 02:30:05.540
<v Speaker 3>Let's do another shot.</v>

5488
02:30:05.570 --> 02:30:08.960
<v Speaker 3>You clink glasses and you know that everybody's all in on it with you.</v>

5489
02:30:08.961 --> 02:30:09.770
<v Speaker 3>That's good stuff.</v>

5490
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:11.780
<v Speaker 3>It's good stuff when it goes the other way from there.</v>

5491
02:30:11.781 --> 02:30:12.230
<v Speaker 3>If you're not,</v>

5492
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:13.400
<v Speaker 3>if that's not how you're doing it,</v>

5493
02:30:13.401 --> 02:30:14.234
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't be doing it.</v>

5494
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:15.291
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

5495
02:30:15.291 --> 02:30:16.190
<v Speaker 3>But again,</v>

5496
02:30:16.280 --> 02:30:17.750
<v Speaker 3>it boils down to who you're doing it with.</v>

5497
02:30:19.370 --> 02:30:20.390
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're an alcoholic,</v>

5498
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:21.740
<v Speaker 3>then it pause down there.</v>

5499
02:30:21.741 --> 02:30:22.041
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

5500
02:30:22.041 --> 02:30:23.180
<v Speaker 3>you got a shitty gene.</v>

5501
02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:26.300
<v Speaker 3>He got some American Indian and Irish.</v>

5502
02:30:26.810 --> 02:30:27.591
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't,</v>

5503
02:30:27.591 --> 02:30:28.010
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

5504
02:30:28.010 --> 02:30:28.843
<v Speaker 3>I kind of,</v>

5505
02:30:29.330 --> 02:30:32.300
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure there's some genetic level of connection to it,</v>

5506
02:30:32.301 --> 02:30:33.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's choice,</v>

5507
02:30:33.261 --> 02:30:33.651
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

5508
02:30:33.651 --> 02:30:34.880
<v Speaker 3>There's a big choice there.</v>

5509
02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:36.073
<v Speaker 3>You can choose,</v>

5510
02:30:36.080 --> 02:30:36.913
<v Speaker 3>you can,</v>

5511
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:38.480
<v Speaker 3>you can choose not to.</v>

5512
02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:39.051
<v Speaker 3>If I,</v>

5513
02:30:39.051 --> 02:30:42.860
<v Speaker 3>if I really suspected I was like fucked up like my father was,</v>

5514
02:30:42.861 --> 02:30:44.630
<v Speaker 3>I would've just chose to never drink.</v>

5515
02:30:45.050 --> 02:30:45.883
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

5516
02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:48.020
<v Speaker 3>Because I was so hyperconscious I,</v>

5517
02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:49.760
<v Speaker 3>cause I was able to see also the pattern.</v>

5518
02:30:49.761 --> 02:30:50.690
<v Speaker 3>My father's father was,</v>

5519
02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:53.120
<v Speaker 3>my father was a good father compared to his father.</v>

5520
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:54.111
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

5521
02:30:54.111 --> 02:30:57.050
<v Speaker 3>My father made improvements so I can see.</v>

5522
02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:57.741
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

5523
02:30:57.741 --> 02:30:58.011
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

5524
02:30:58.011 --> 02:31:00.770
<v Speaker 3>so it's my turn to make that improvement.</v>

5525
02:31:00.771 --> 02:31:02.420
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly the same with my father.</v>

5526
02:31:02.450 --> 02:31:05.180
<v Speaker 3>My father's father was even more of a savage.</v>

5527
02:31:05.210 --> 02:31:09.890
<v Speaker 3>He came over from Ireland during the depression and my mom told me that when she</v>

5528
02:31:09.891 --> 02:31:10.640
<v Speaker 3>was young,</v>

5529
02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:12.860
<v Speaker 3>my dad's dad tried to fuck her.</v>

5530
02:31:13.390 --> 02:31:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Like she was,</v>

5531
02:31:14.810 --> 02:31:16.880
<v Speaker 3>she was like when she'd already had me,</v>

5532
02:31:16.910 --> 02:31:19.070
<v Speaker 3>like she'd be over the house and my father would step,</v>

5533
02:31:19.230 --> 02:31:20.210
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna go down the corner</v>

5534
02:31:20.280 --> 02:31:21.210
<v Speaker 1>and my dad would be like,</v>

5535
02:31:21.211 --> 02:31:22.320
<v Speaker 1>in my dad's father would be like,</v>

5536
02:31:22.321 --> 02:31:22.800
<v Speaker 1>what's up?</v>

5537
02:31:22.800 --> 02:31:23.100
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>

5538
02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:23.933
<v Speaker 1>You want some of this?</v>

5539
02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:24.601
<v Speaker 1>And she'd be like,</v>

5540
02:31:24.601 --> 02:31:25.530
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

5541
02:31:25.531 --> 02:31:30.531
<v Speaker 1>Kind of crazy family is this just drunk savages from the depression?</v>

5542
02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Those were people that were worried about starving to death.</v>

5543
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:36.930
<v Speaker 1>Those are people that would take a piece of pussy in a heartbeat.</v>

5544
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:37.710
<v Speaker 1>They were,</v>

5545
02:31:37.710 --> 02:31:38.071
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

5546
02:31:38.071 --> 02:31:39.690
<v Speaker 1>they were rapist and savages.</v>

5547
02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:40.771
<v Speaker 1>There were animals.</v>

5548
02:31:40.771 --> 02:31:43.110
<v Speaker 1>They took a fucking boat ride across the world.</v>

5549
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:46.770
<v Speaker 1>The wind up in some place where they never even saw a picture of it.</v>

5550
02:31:47.060 --> 02:31:49.950
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea what was going to be like landed on a boat,</v>

5551
02:31:49.951 --> 02:31:51.570
<v Speaker 1>God out and we're hey,</v>

5552
02:31:51.571 --> 02:31:52.380
<v Speaker 1>made their way.</v>

5553
02:31:52.380 --> 02:31:52.591
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5554
02:31:52.591 --> 02:31:53.221
<v Speaker 1>we're hated.</v>

5555
02:31:53.221 --> 02:31:54.054
<v Speaker 1>Hated,</v>

5556
02:31:54.450 --> 02:31:55.260
<v Speaker 1>made their way.</v>

5557
02:31:55.260 --> 02:31:57.780
<v Speaker 1>This is so much closer to animals.</v>

5558
02:31:57.990 --> 02:32:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Hence the back fest woman Schmuck,</v>

5559
02:32:00.890 --> 02:32:01.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5560
02:32:01.200 --> 02:32:03.390
<v Speaker 1>that's from the 1950s that she was acceptable.</v>

5561
02:32:03.390 --> 02:32:04.560
<v Speaker 1>People were crazy back then.</v>

5562
02:32:05.250 --> 02:32:06.360
<v Speaker 1>They were fucking animals.</v>

5563
02:32:06.570 --> 02:32:07.350
<v Speaker 1>The crazy now,</v>

5564
02:32:07.350 --> 02:32:07.861
<v Speaker 1>but the better,</v>

5565
02:32:07.861 --> 02:32:08.694
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

5566
02:32:08.940 --> 02:32:09.620
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully,</v>

5567
02:32:09.620 --> 02:32:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I figured there's no Rogan's any sign.</v>

5568
02:32:11.690 --> 02:32:14.220
<v Speaker 1>If he has any proof that culture is evolving.</v>

5569
02:32:14.250 --> 02:32:15.840
<v Speaker 1>It's the proof in our record of culture.</v>

5570
02:32:15.841 --> 02:32:16.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm our songs,</v>

5571
02:32:17.070 --> 02:32:17.350
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

5572
02:32:17.350 --> 02:32:17.691
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

5573
02:32:17.691 --> 02:32:18.011
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

5574
02:32:18.011 --> 02:32:18.844
<v Speaker 1>our movies.</v>

5575
02:32:19.260 --> 02:32:19.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5576
02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:20.850
<v Speaker 1>our standup comedy,</v>

5577
02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:21.271
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5578
02:32:21.271 --> 02:32:22.200
<v Speaker 1>you want to see the,</v>

5579
02:32:22.210 --> 02:32:24.660
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of culture in the,</v>

5580
02:32:24.661 --> 02:32:25.690
<v Speaker 1>in standup comedy.</v>

5581
02:32:25.710 --> 02:32:26.970
<v Speaker 1>So a good microcosm.</v>

5582
02:32:26.971 --> 02:32:28.620
<v Speaker 1>It's good way to look at the evolution of culture.</v>

5583
02:32:28.621 --> 02:32:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Go back and try to watch like some old comedy from the 1950s and sixties it's so</v>

5584
02:32:32.671 --> 02:32:33.504
<v Speaker 1>dated.</v>

5585
02:32:33.540 --> 02:32:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Even if you can put yourself into that mindset and see the brilliance of it.</v>

5586
02:32:36.331 --> 02:32:37.350
<v Speaker 1>It's so dated,</v>

5587
02:32:38.230 --> 02:32:38.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5588
02:32:38.610 --> 02:32:40.920
<v Speaker 1>watch some Lenny Bruce tried to laugh.</v>

5589
02:32:41.080 --> 02:32:42.400
<v Speaker 1>That's how as edgy as he was,</v>

5590
02:32:43.060 --> 02:32:43.771
<v Speaker 1>he was the greatest.</v>

5591
02:32:43.771 --> 02:32:44.670
<v Speaker 1>He opened up all the doors,</v>

5592
02:32:44.671 --> 02:32:46.050
<v Speaker 1>but you can't wash that shit today.</v>

5593
02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:48.750
<v Speaker 1>It's weird in Carlene's still some of it,</v>

5594
02:32:49.050 --> 02:32:49.800
<v Speaker 1>some of it,</v>

5595
02:32:49.800 --> 02:32:50.940
<v Speaker 1>some of it is still dated though.</v>

5596
02:32:50.941 --> 02:32:53.130
<v Speaker 1>If you go to the really old stuff priors,</v>

5597
02:32:53.131 --> 02:32:55.200
<v Speaker 1>the first guy to me that's universal,</v>

5598
02:32:55.410 --> 02:32:55.981
<v Speaker 1>like he's,</v>

5599
02:32:55.981 --> 02:32:57.490
<v Speaker 1>he stands the test of time he's at,</v>

5600
02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:58.373
<v Speaker 1>he's evergreen.</v>

5601
02:32:58.740 --> 02:32:59.130
<v Speaker 1>His,</v>

5602
02:32:59.130 --> 02:32:59.810
<v Speaker 1>his shit.</v>

5603
02:32:59.810 --> 02:33:02.460
<v Speaker 1>His shit was so like raw.</v>

5604
02:33:02.640 --> 02:33:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Like when he would talk about his life and the way he would describe things was</v>

5605
02:33:06.751 --> 02:33:09.450
<v Speaker 1>so raw that I think to this day still resonates.</v>

5606
02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5607
02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first time watching it live on the sunset strip.</v>

5608
02:33:13.441 --> 02:33:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah.</v>

5609
02:33:14.341 --> 02:33:15.690
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't supposed to be watching it.</v>

5610
02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:16.553
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

5611
02:33:17.310 --> 02:33:17.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5612
02:33:17.431 --> 02:33:18.810
<v Speaker 1>It was in the movie theater.</v>

5613
02:33:19.350 --> 02:33:22.320
<v Speaker 1>The guy was just talking and everybody was dying laughing.</v>

5614
02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:22.891
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>

5615
02:33:22.891 --> 02:33:24.420
<v Speaker 1>that was a game changer for a lot of people.</v>

5616
02:33:24.421 --> 02:33:28.020
<v Speaker 1>That was the first time a lot of people got to see comedy like that created a</v>

5617
02:33:28.021 --> 02:33:30.000
<v Speaker 1>whole generation of comics,</v>

5618
02:33:30.001 --> 02:33:30.271
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

5619
02:33:30.271 --> 02:33:31.070
<v Speaker 1>that sure.</v>

5620
02:33:31.070 --> 02:33:31.903
<v Speaker 1>A little era.</v>

5621
02:33:32.100 --> 02:33:33.600
<v Speaker 1>He was the first really honest guy.</v>

5622
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5623
02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:34.531
<v Speaker 1>him and Lenny Bruce,</v>

5624
02:33:34.531 --> 02:33:36.330
<v Speaker 1>Lenny Bruce was the first really honest guy too,</v>

5625
02:33:36.331 --> 02:33:37.164
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

5626
02:33:37.230 --> 02:33:40.320
<v Speaker 1>but not when it came to his personal life prior.</v>

5627
02:33:40.321 --> 02:33:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Took it to a completely different level than anybody had before.</v>

5628
02:33:43.620 --> 02:33:43.951
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

5629
02:33:43.951 --> 02:33:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I love that movie too.</v>

02:33:45.090 --> 02:33:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Joe.</v>

5631
02:33:45.310 --> 02:33:46.143
<v Speaker 1>Joe Dancing.</v>

5632
02:33:46.710 --> 02:33:51.710
<v Speaker 1>We got to wrap this up with one with one or two more.</v>

5633
02:33:52.020 --> 02:33:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Which ones do you want to play?</v>
