291
00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.380
<v Speaker 1>What's a typical day live in like a doctor who liked it.</v>

292
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I became a standup comic.</v>

293
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.790
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to do standup killing prisoners on Thursday nights.</v>

294
00:08:50.791 --> 00:08:51.810
<v Speaker 1>They used to have movie night.</v>

295
00:08:51.811 --> 00:08:52.644
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know that.</v>

296
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.690
<v Speaker 1>They used to have movie that on Thursday night.</v>

297
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So the projector would always fuck up like Ustream.</v>

298
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.141
<v Speaker 1>I would always go,</v>

299
00:08:58.141 --> 00:08:59.500
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is wrong with them projecting?</v>

300
00:08:59.510 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

301
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would say Cuba.</v>

302
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Get up there and talk and I would make fun of the black guys.</v>

303
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:03.931
<v Speaker 1>But what would it be?</v>

304
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:04.764
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>

305
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

306
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>we make fun of the kitchen the first day in prison.</v>

307
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 1>It may be a baker,</v>

308
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:08.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

309
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:08.881
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

310
00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.080
<v Speaker 1>you don't tell people what you want.</v>

311
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like Cuba.</v>

312
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.311
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>

313
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:11.881
<v Speaker 1>the outside,</v>

314
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I was a mechanic really?</v>

315
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Well and here you are,</v>

316
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.750
<v Speaker 1>a baker going to say,</v>

317
00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>here's a book,</v>

318
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>learn how to make bagels.</v>

319
00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I may be sending them.</v>

320
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Rose dog almost blew up the kitchen,</v>

321
00:09:20.071 --> 00:09:20.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

322
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>These mother fuckers are big.</v>

323
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>So that afternoon they fired me,</v>

324
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:27.830
<v Speaker 1>has a baker and they made me a fucking dishwasher right now,</v>

325
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.190
<v Speaker 1>whenever they had shitty meals,</v>

326
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the guys I knew when they would go through the line and I would yell,</v>

327
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.203
<v Speaker 1>don't do,</v>

328
00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's more drugs on the inside.</v>

329
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:37.891
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>

330
00:09:37.891 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't any oxide.</v>

331
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:39.631
<v Speaker 1>And to boot.</v>

332
00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>This was a minimum security camp.</v>

333
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>We had contact visits.</v>

334
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 1>When you have a contact visit,</v>

335
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>there's parties every night.</v>

336
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>But that's the first time I did it.</v>

337
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

338
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.491
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

339
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 1>the second time I did it,</v>

340
00:09:48.451 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 1>no one was there and he couldn't do a needle.</v>

341
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 1>So the Mexican is took a Mexican thing,</v>

342
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:54.110
<v Speaker 1>a heroin melted it.</v>

343
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 1>I had to put like a funnel in mind.</v>

344
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Those made out of paper and they drifted in my nose and I got mad like candle</v>

345
00:09:59.271 --> 00:09:59.530
<v Speaker 1>wick,</v>

346
00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.363
<v Speaker 1>Bro,</v>

347
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:02.070
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

348
00:10:02.071 --> 00:10:02.371
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

349
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>that's heroin man.</v>

350
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:04.021
<v Speaker 1>Be Cool.</v>

351
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I was like this for like a day.</v>

352
00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And then the white dudes,</v>

353
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Michael's gimmie speed and they would play basketball all fucking night.</v>

354
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll be out there of hell's angels</v>

355
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.710
<v Speaker 1>and there'd be out there with them.</v>

356
00:10:17.711 --> 00:10:18.541
<v Speaker 1>Half of them every week.</v>

357
00:10:18.541 --> 00:10:19.374
<v Speaker 1>It was a new adventure.</v>

358
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So on Thursday nights they would say,</v>

359
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:22.621
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

360
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:23.281
<v Speaker 1>fuck the movie.</v>

361
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:24.720
<v Speaker 1>Just go up there and talk about the kitchen.</v>

362
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:25.733
<v Speaker 1>And they were all,</v>

363
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 1>all the yarns would yell,</v>

364
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

365
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I went in there every Thursday I get onstage and then one day a guy in the</v>

366
00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:35.701
<v Speaker 1>library,</v>

367
00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:36.840
<v Speaker 1>it was like a nerdy dude,</v>

368
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 1>the guy that ran the library and I was friends with him.</v>

369
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>We did acid and the funny thing was that one day he came up to me in the jail</v>

370
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and a notebook was a big thing and I was getting ready to get out and I didn't</v>

371
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:47.161
<v Speaker 1>even thought about it.</v>

372
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 1>He came up to me and then he goes,</v>

373
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:48.541
<v Speaker 1>hey bro,</v>

374
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I got you a notebook.</v>

375
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:50.941
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

376
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>what's the notebook for your show when you get out?</v>

377
00:10:52.741 --> 00:10:53.670
<v Speaker 1>You could write some jokes.</v>

378
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.613
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

379
00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.160
<v Speaker 1>every week you write jokes.</v>

380
00:10:56.161 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I never see the notebook.</v>

381
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:57.864
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him and I go,</v>

382
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't even right and this motherfucker went nuts.</v>

383
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:01.891
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

384
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:04.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't right and you go up there every week and do that.</v>

385
00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:05.461
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

386
00:11:05.461 --> 00:11:06.161
<v Speaker 1>when you get out here,</v>

387
00:11:06.161 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

388
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.313
<v Speaker 1>it was like an angel.</v>

389
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.161
<v Speaker 1>It was like an angel.</v>

390
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I never seen the guy again.</v>

391
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I never heard from again.</v>

392
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.483
<v Speaker 1>He just goes,</v>

393
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:12.540
<v Speaker 1>what I watch you do?</v>

394
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:15.600
<v Speaker 1>You really need to write and get it together because you have a gift.</v>

395
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Just pursue this.</v>

396
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 1>It was in the back of my head.</v>

397
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.610
<v Speaker 1>The prison really woke the animal.</v>

398
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I know so many people look at you.</v>

399
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I know so many people that in one point in their life were not good people.</v>

400
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:30.270
<v Speaker 1>There were there were fucked up to run a bad place,</v>

401
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 1>but they turned around and became some of my favorite people.</v>

402
00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:33.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

403
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:34.870
<v Speaker 1>you're a perfect example actually.</v>

404
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely can change rules and there's confusion.</v>

405
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:39.541
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

406
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:41.400
<v Speaker 1>kids don't know what the fuck they want to do.</v>

407
00:11:41.401 --> 00:11:42.234
<v Speaker 1>I was lost.</v>

408
00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Speaker 1>I thought that's what I wanted to do and once I did it,</v>

409
00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I seen the reality of it and never did it again.</v>

410
00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And for some people they take the lesson,</v>

411
00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:50.071
<v Speaker 1>they run with it,</v>

412
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:53.560
<v Speaker 1>and for some other people they fucking keep doing what they were doing because</v>

413
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 1>they don't really want to go anywhere.</v>

414
00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 1>And I'm really wanting go only way.</v>

415
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Even in my darkest moments,</v>

416
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.710
<v Speaker 1>I always just wanted a little bit of light so I could shut it.</v>

417
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Just to go forward with the,</v>

418
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for 50 hours just to get me started.</v>

419
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.491
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

420
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>To get an apartment,</v>

421
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.040
<v Speaker 1>to get a car tall.</v>

422
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 1>I wanted I the Webinar fucked fuckers up there watching me that I got a break</v>

426
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:17.550
<v Speaker 1>When I wake up in the morning,</v>

432
00:12:28.811 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that thing in the back of your mind.</v>
