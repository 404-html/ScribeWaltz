<v Speaker 1>Attach your whole life to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too hard to win and every </v>

166
00:06:58.971 --> 00:06:59.804
<v Speaker 1>phone life to let some certain losses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come your way and </v>

167
00:07:03.801 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 1>you've got to regroup and you've got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick up the paces,</v>

168
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.930
<v Speaker 1>paces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paces,</v>

169
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.373
<v Speaker 1>pick up the pieces and move on with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life for Christ or bigger fan of your </v>

170
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>podcast and you are of your podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watch all of them.</v>

171
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Sharon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you ever say that?</v>

172
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.090
<v Speaker 1>That Joe Rogan's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not saying anything either.</v>

173
00:07:20.091 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>So David Choe found it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think anybody named Roy has</v>

174
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>been on the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Came on with David Show.</v>

175
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did.</v>

176
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>He's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David was been on a few times,</v>

177
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe came to one of the ice house </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronicles.</v>

178
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.680
<v Speaker 1>Was it a nice house?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chronical?</v>

179
00:07:33.681 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going through,</v>

180
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.060
<v Speaker 1>this was David's show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did David show once.</v>

181
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was five 92 with David.</v>

182
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:44.930
<v Speaker 1>She was the one episode I wasn't here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

183
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:45.883
<v Speaker 1>Could have been the one episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Jamie was on five 63 that can't be </v>

184
00:07:48.621 --> 00:07:49.431
<v Speaker 1>that dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb,</v>

185
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumb.</v>

186
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:57.310
<v Speaker 1>What gave it shows podcasts that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan was on that podcast could have</v>

187
00:07:57.681 --> 00:07:58.600
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

188
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.460
<v Speaker 1>it makes more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number five 92 I have a,</v>

189
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>this is horrible podcasting and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

190
00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I have a hard time believing when we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually done 750 podcasts.</v>

191
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:14.050
<v Speaker 1>I was all five 90 27697006969 bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've done 769 podcasts.</v>

192
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Indeed preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great man.</v>

193
00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:20.803
<v Speaker 1>I like what you did and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I may have told you this one </v>

194
00:08:22.561 --> 00:08:24.060
<v Speaker 1>thing fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

195
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

196
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm envious in a sense of what you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done and only,</v>

197
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I only had that I could not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Begin it now.</v>

198
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.113
<v Speaker 1>What you did is you kind of took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of took the renaissance to </v>

199
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:34.934
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you allowed people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>think differently than you to come to </v>

200
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:41.180
<v Speaker 1>you and talk to you and you got to kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of soak in the information like a sponge</v>

201
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.260
<v Speaker 1>as a stand up man.</v>

202
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.450
<v Speaker 1>That is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the fucking,</v>

203
00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:45.284
<v Speaker 1>that's what we all should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just sitting around and </v>

204
00:08:47.031 --> 00:08:47.864
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this guy think about </v>

205
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>airplanes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

206
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:50.924
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really kind of broadened the </v>

207
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of what you want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>on stage.</v>

208
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:59.790
<v Speaker 1>And I remember hearing Chris rock say </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he got invited to Cornell Wallace's</v>

209
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:00.714
<v Speaker 1>house for Sunday dinners and right </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he did his most monumental hour </v>

210
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.651
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 1>it was really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say anything.</v>

212
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:06.744
<v Speaker 1>I just would sit and listen to all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>great Glenn Wallace or West Cornell </v>

234
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:04.890
<v Speaker 1>a lighter and a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

235
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler time machine.</v>

236
00:10:08.901 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stops or join in on this.</v>

237
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Can I handle this one on my own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm so let's play.</v>

238
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.823
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying simple mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend that that's the time </v>

239
00:10:20.011 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

240
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:21.451
<v Speaker 1>We got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

241
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:22.460
<v Speaker 1>We invent a time machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

242
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.303
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we right now we can travel back to that </v>

243
00:10:24.361 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>moment three days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can try to travel back to this moment</v>

244
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 1>or three days to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can say to Brian,</v>

245
00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our time machine really just consists of</v>

246
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:36.510
<v Speaker 1>a bottle of champagne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a joint and lighter.</v>

247
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Go to f,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's fucking send you back.</v>

248
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>You know the three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill one then come back to me.</v>

249
00:10:43.411 --> 00:10:44.244
<v Speaker 1>Now your idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she gets together with my chipolte lay </v>

250
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have sex and have a baby.</v>

251
00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:49.164
<v Speaker 1>That makes no sense you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no time machine never going to </v>

252
00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:59.431
<v Speaker 1>be built because Donald Trump is </v>
<v Speaker 1>president and dogs living together.</v>

253
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>We're a simulation program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time machine doesn't matter.</v>

254
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Burt's ideas back to the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three basically.</v>

255
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Jamie shutting your shit down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuck what they do to your,</v>

257
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:19.150
<v Speaker 1>you're interrupting your Kettle Bell </v>
<v Speaker 1>Workout on a stop shutting down.</v>

258
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
