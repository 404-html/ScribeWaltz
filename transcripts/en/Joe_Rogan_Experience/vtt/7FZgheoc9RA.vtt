1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.760
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience of Vi red.</v>

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:03.594
<v Speaker 1>Why the worlds?</v>

3
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>The opening line is something like,</v>

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.220
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember the opening line and I'm paraphrasing.</v>

5
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>The earth was B.</v>

6
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.610
<v Speaker 1>We knew we were being watched or what we didn't know was we were being watched</v>

7
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>and that's a great opening line for a Scifi novel.</v>

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Martians are watching us and then they shunned their ships and everything.</v>

9
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful Scifi novel because it's so precise.</v>

10
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.891
<v Speaker 1>Just Know Sigh.</v>

11
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>He made up all the PSI and wells really did make it up like he knew nothing</v>

12
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>about technology show.</v>

13
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:31.724
<v Speaker 1>It's awesome.</v>

14
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>You know how the tripods come out of the ships and they have laser beams and</v>

15
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>they basically laser beam everything.</v>

16
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Like he just started made APP.</v>

17
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be this beam of pure energy or whatever.</v>

18
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>You know what's fascinating and he did do that,</v>

19
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>but that's what a lot of people use as their template for the future.</v>

20
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>When they thought about like future weapons,</v>

21
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>it was always a laser beam.</v>

22
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>It was always a beam.</v>

23
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Well wait,</v>

24
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I think what's,</v>

25
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>once physics were understood that things were in particles that wasn't,</v>

26
00:00:57.901 --> 00:00:58.591
<v Speaker 1>that they get jumped,</v>

27
00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.424
<v Speaker 1>that there would bitch be,</v>

28
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.353
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

29
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.021
<v Speaker 1>this isn't Zeus.</v>

30
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Is Thunderbolts the ultimate.</v>

31
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.001
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

32
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

33
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.343
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>

34
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.970
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

35
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.121
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

37
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:06.391
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

38
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:06.571
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

39
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>just thunder in general.</v>

40
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Just the idea of this power,</v>

41
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>this electricity for everybody knew what electricity wasn't what it could do.</v>

42
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I would have loved to been alive,</v>

43
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>before electricity was explained and see what the fuck people were saying.</v>

45
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

47
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine what people were saying back when,</v>

48
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.933
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>people barely had a language they barely could string together a sentence that</v>

50
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:31.770
<v Speaker 1>you would understand and the fucking sky bolts of come to a sky and hitting the</v>

51
00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>ground balls of light.</v>

52
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

53
00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

54
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>Through a field you have to deal with that.</v>

55
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>there's been an instance that I read about,</v>

57
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>well of ball lightning.</v>

59
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>Like there's been several instances of ball lightning that they think explains</v>

60
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.683
<v Speaker 1>Ufos.</v>

61
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

62
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.871
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised.</v>

63
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that that a lot of,</v>

64
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>not all you have,</v>

65
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.273
<v Speaker 1>I was obviously,</v>

66
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>but some Ufo sightings,</v>

67
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:54.750
<v Speaker 1>they talk about these orbs that are flying orbs of light apparently under</v>

68
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>certain geological pressures,</v>

69
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>like certain pressures on near fault lines and,</v>

70
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.973
<v Speaker 1>and the like,</v>

71
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

72
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>there's fucking bolts of lightening that like come out of the ground.</v>

73
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't be surprised if,</v>

74
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

75
00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to and it can last for like three or four seconds.</v>

76
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.811
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

77
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>if everything in the world is an electric charge and everything is totally makes</v>

78
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:13.831
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

79
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

80
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Just a weird spark,</v>

81
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:15.831 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>that occurs.</v>

83
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>What is this ball of light and yeah,</v>

84
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>mainly exciting.</v>

85
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>My wife and I were in a Capri ones and uh,</v>

86
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a little island off the coast of Naples.</v>

87
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 1>And is that enough?</v>

88
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.993
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

89
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>well I think they're saying this is ball lightning.</v>

90
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

91
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

92
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>That could believe it would be ball lightning cause ball lightning has weird</v>

93
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>properties.</v>

94
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:37.921
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

96
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>look at that just disappeared.</v>

97
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a femoral and it righter than fuck.</v>

98
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>So you can see it from miles away.</v>

99
00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:44.300
<v Speaker 1>Right and right.</v>

100
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>And you when lightening hits things,</v>

101
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>you know how you always see sparks and shit?</v>

102
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.100
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I were sitting,</v>

104
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>we were having dinner and this and it's a little island and a big storm started</v>

105
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>brewing on the Mediterranean and all of a sudden everything,</v>

106
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:57.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the ozone in the air and your hair starts to stand up.</v>

108
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:03.360
<v Speaker 1>And it was a light breeze and Capri smells like Lemons and bay leaves.</v>

109
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>So it was really beautiful.</v>

110
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.471
<v Speaker 1>And I said to my wife,</v>

111
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>and this is what a rabbit smells like right before the lid comes down on the,</v>

112
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Bailey in Lebanon and hey,</v>

114
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

115
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm uh,</v>

116
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and then we sat on the balcony of our hotel and the storm never hit Capri,</v>

117
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>but it was several miles away and we watched it and it just,</v>

118
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>just giant lightening strikes out in the clouds and that it never got close</v>

119
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:28.991
<v Speaker 1>enough to rain.</v>

120
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

121
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

122
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:30.281
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

123
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:30.641
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

124
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:30.771
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

125
00:03:30.771 --> 00:03:31.121
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

126
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>this is like watching the gods play,</v>

127
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:32.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

128
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>Like here,</v>

129
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>we're sitting here with a glass of wine and the air electric and all you,</v>

130
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>you'd hear it,</v>

131
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.261
<v Speaker 1>and then you,</v>

133
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:41.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>you see it and then you'd hear it afterwards because it was that far away.</v>

135
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Now you need clouds to have light.</v>

136
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

137
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 1>And the clouds were just crashing together and it would,</v>

138
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you'd see like,</v>

139
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

140
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.011
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is,</v>

141
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.581
<v Speaker 1>were you were,</v>

142
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have to worry.</v>

143
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>There's no clouds above you.</v>

144
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:55.054
<v Speaker 1>You didn't have to worry.</v>

145
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

146
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>it was at least a couple of miles away.</v>

147
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:58.481
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

148
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>So you don't want to clear sky said it.</v>

149
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:00.934
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

151
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

152
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>Clear Mediterranean sky simply that you could feel the raised electricity in the</v>

153
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:11.371
<v Speaker 1>air because there was a breeze blowing end on your hair was on an down and there</v>

154
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:12.971
<v Speaker 1>was a lot of ozone,</v>

155
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:13.804
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>from all the crashing,</v>

157
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>but it never got close enough to never hit the island and never poured rain.</v>

158
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>It just sort of stayed right off the island.</v>

159
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

160
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>that's so exciting.</v>

161
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>If I could always have storms to spectate,</v>

162
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:23.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>cause she'd watch a ball just like shoot from one cloud to another arcane rope,</v>

164
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:28.121
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

166
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>and it was endlessly entertaining.</v>

167
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing more entertaining than lightening,</v>

168
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:34.144
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>the noise of the thunder and that smell of,</v>

170
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know you're not going to die.</v>

171
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>That was what made it so great.</v>

172
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>We were sitting there with a joint and a glass of wine.</v>

173
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:42.611
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

174
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>heavenly cause if you're in a city,</v>

176
00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:46.420
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in New York City,</v>

177
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>big no storm goes on.</v>

178
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>You have this weird feeling that lightening could hit this fucking building</v>

179
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>anytime and my windows could explode.</v>

180
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>I was on a plane with my wife going into Frankfurt,</v>

181
00:04:59.681 --> 00:05:04.681
<v Speaker 1>Germany for the World Cup like in 2006 and we flew through a giant electrical</v>

182
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:06.154
<v Speaker 1>storm.</v>

183
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>So we're on the plane and I'm looking out the window and the plane's bouncing up</v>

184
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>and down and a giant ball of lightening struck the wing of the plane.</v>

185
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh my watch on.</v>

186
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:20.911
<v Speaker 1>And it went like this and then bang and huge booming noise.</v>

187
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 1>The lights dimmed for a second and went right back on and everyone on the planet</v>

188
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.651
<v Speaker 1>like dot.</v>

189
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:27.170
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

190
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh Margo flight attendants went fucking white.</v>

191
00:05:29.951 --> 00:05:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Which then I was a little scared because I thought,</v>

192
00:05:32.411 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 1>well they shouldn't be freaked out.</v>

193
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

194
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And my wife was panicked.</v>

195
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>He and I went,</v>

196
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>not that I was so great,</v>

197
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>but I went the wing still there.</v>

198
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Let's start there.</v>

199
00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>The wing,</v>

200
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.590
<v Speaker 1>the wing is completely intact and hit the ball lightning right at the end of</v>

201
00:05:47.591 --> 00:05:47.681
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

202
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:47.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:49.340
<v Speaker 1>the little metal thing they have at the end of the one,</v>

204
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.203
<v Speaker 1>they have a metal thing,</v>

205
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:52.483
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>exoskeleton thing around them.</v>

207
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:54.950
<v Speaker 1>So then lightening hits,</v>

208
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.630
<v Speaker 1>it's disperses around the planet.</v>

209
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>So prepare for that.</v>

210
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you have to write because they're going to fly through electricity</v>

211
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>that look at that picture.</v>

212
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.163
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

213
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.320
<v Speaker 1>You never hear about planes blowing up because we got hit by,</v>

214
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.981
<v Speaker 1>look at this,</v>

215
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:07.814
<v Speaker 1>watch this.</v>

216
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh that will,</v>

217
00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.921
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

218
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause and then when you see it in real life,</v>

219
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>it looks like nothing like so fast.</v>

220
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

221
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Let me see what it actually is.</v>

222
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.050
<v Speaker 1>It got hit and then the pilot didn't come off for like 10 minutes.</v>

223
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>That rat,</v>

224
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>he let us all sweat and everybody was like scared shitless maybe.</v>

225
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Then the pilot came on and he chocolate Kissinger.</v>

226
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.910
<v Speaker 1>He was German obviously,</v>

227
00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:26.200
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

228
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.661
<v Speaker 1>he first,</v>

229
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>he didn't German than English,</v>

230
00:06:27.711 --> 00:06:29.430
<v Speaker 1>but when he spoke in English she sounded like Kissinger,</v>

231
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:32.623
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

232
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.700
<v Speaker 1>blood is harmless and everybody was like,</v>

233
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.563
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

234
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here?</v>

235
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 1>But it looks scary.</v>

236
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 1>This is the Turkish airplane hit by lightening strike inside playing video,</v>

237
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know why there was sparks going.</v>

238
00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.031
<v Speaker 1>Look at the door.</v>

239
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 1>The doors.</v>

240
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

241
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>they just got hit right there and the lights go out.</v>

242
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.611
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

243
00:06:53.611 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying.</v>

244
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.623
<v Speaker 2>The mountains.</v>

245
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Shit's terrifying man.</v>

246
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Shut it off now.</v>

247
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:02.520
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be nice.</v>

248
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever put that back on again.</v>

249
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>We got to fly everywhere.</v>

250
00:07:05.751 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm flying this weekend.</v>

251
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's just collide together and drive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

256
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>flying through the sky where the fucking gods are angry,</v>

257
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.481
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

258
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Did I tell you this one?</v>

259
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.891
<v Speaker 1>If I've told it,</v>

260
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:19.690
<v Speaker 1>I'll stop.</v>

261
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.301
<v Speaker 1>We flied out.</v>

262
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:22.910

263
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Usually you're on a giant plane,</v>

264
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>but it was on like a seven 37 you know,</v>

265
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 1>like that Australia.</v>

266
00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

267
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.880

268
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 1>which is agree with the airline.</v>

276
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's hectic,</v>

277
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:49.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

278
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 1>It starts to get the MP and the pilot comes on and goes like everybody strapped</v>

279
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

280
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

281
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.303
<v Speaker 1>For like ever.</v>

282
00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>And it Australia is 15 hours,</v>

283
00:07:58.461 --> 00:07:59.710
<v Speaker 1>16 minutes long.</v>

284
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just the whole day.</v>

285
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>And this lasted literally five hours,</v>

286
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:04.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

287
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

288
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Just bouncing up and down.</v>

289
00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 1>So I decided pitching yard,</v>

290
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing and on the,</v>

291
00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.670
<v Speaker 1>on the sky map,</v>

292
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.470
<v Speaker 1>but it says like Paygo,</v>

293
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:13.304
<v Speaker 1>Paygo,</v>

294
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.630
<v Speaker 1>1500 kilometers,</v>

295
00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.420
<v Speaker 1>meaning your 1500 kilometers from Paco.</v>

296
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Paco.</v>

297
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:18.501
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

298
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific Ocean is so big,</v>

299
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 1>there's no land masses,</v>

300
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.150
<v Speaker 1>nothing anywhere near you where you're going over.</v>

301
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

302
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.760
<v Speaker 1>So you're not going to go in because its turbulence,</v>

303
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not your fucking freaking me out.</v>

304
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:31.244
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to die.</v>

305
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.330
<v Speaker 1>This is an electric turbulence,</v>

306
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make planes crash and it doesn't,</v>

307
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 1>unless there's some sort of Shitty,</v>

308
00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 1>a structural defect on the plane like that,</v>

309
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:39.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>the wings aren't glued on or whatever.</v>

311
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.771
<v Speaker 1>But I mean videos,</v>

312
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 1>structural defect</v>

313
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:45.360
<v Speaker 1>generally.</v>

314
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Now you've been in a play turbulence data,</v>

315
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>that's not what makes him crashing,</v>

317
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

318
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.400
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

319
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:50.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

320
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Shit Shit,</v>

321
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.550
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible in any case.</v>

322
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>So we get through it and a next morning and the rappers get up and they're all</v>

323
00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.681
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

325
00:08:58.681 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to die.</v>

326
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:00.661

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And the rappers because you didn't feel that we were going to die that had to</v>

346
00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:27.941

<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

359

00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:54.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:59.550
<v Speaker 1>stop bouncing so we can stop producing.</v>

365
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.140

368
00:10:07.201 --> 00:10:07.800
<v Speaker 1>off the plane,</v>

369
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I believe you did tell the story.</v>

370

374
00:10:15.991 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I heard you tell a story.</v>

375
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I remember it now after it's over.</v>

376
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 1>We talked about the girl getting out and changing.</v>

377
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

378
00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>that's a great story.</v>

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

380
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.760
<v Speaker 1>It's great that someone could be that,</v>

381
00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.550
<v Speaker 1>that out cold on ambient.</v>

382
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.120
<v Speaker 1>So there's positive things to ambien.</v>

383
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about shit about Ambien,</v>

384
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 1>but if ambient can get you to avoid that,</v>

385
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.120
<v Speaker 1>not one minute at that.</v>

386
00:10:33.121 --> 00:10:33.954
<v Speaker 1>And it lasts.</v>

387
00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

388
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:35.820

389
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 1>but it always made me laugh because I was scared to death.</v>

390
00:10:39.121 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 1>And when I got off the plane,</v>
