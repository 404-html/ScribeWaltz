53
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>That was before anybody knew who rampage was.</v>

54
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>I misunderstood him cause he was going by the slug once again,</v>

55
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>like 99 2000.</v>

56
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>I had finished it,</v>

57
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Ucla where I first got my taste of Jujitsu was at Ucla.</v>

58
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And then I got,</v>

59
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I graduated and I went to teen punishment and I get on the mat and Fabiana you</v>

60
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>was a coach there at the time.</v>

61
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Find out what the best arm bars in the duty Monday.</v>

62
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.790
<v Speaker 1>His arm bar was fine,</v>

63
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>especially Farside side.</v>

64
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.611
<v Speaker 1>And so we,</v>

65
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:48.444
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

66
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>I got on the mat and I shake hands with this dude and I said,</v>

67
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.911

<v Speaker 1>I'm rampage.</v>

71
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I misunderstood him.</v>

72
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

73
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.670

<v Speaker 1>is it Randall or something?</v>

77
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>And I just misunderstood him.</v>

78
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>And all I knew was I knew armbarring to foot locker at the time and he was so</v>

79
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:07.141
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>

80
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:07.341
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

81
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna foot log him and,</v>

00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I went fully straight full locks on them.</v>

84
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

85
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

86
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.101

<v Speaker 1>I'm going him.</v>

88
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 1>And then I got an arm bar on him and he lifted me up to the ceiling with one arm</v>

89
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 1>just around at my ass just went boom,</v>

90
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:20.034
<v Speaker 1>dropped right on me.</v>

91
00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>And Fabiano comes running over mad like,</v>

92
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

93

<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to do that.</v>

94
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>And just start screaming at him.</v>

95
00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 1>And he walks off ramp.</v>

96
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:27.241
<v Speaker 1>He turns to me.</v>

00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:27.940

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.981

108
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I've been slammed before and that was it.</v>

109
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>That time it meant Quinten man back then.</v>

110
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

111
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Jeff Novitsky.</v>

112
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>How are you buddy?</v>

113
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>What's up Joe?</v>

114
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.970
<v Speaker 1>Doing good.</v>

115
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I have to ask you,</v>

116
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>do you mind the nickname the golden snitch?</v>

117
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>So first thing I was going to bring up</v>

118
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>this golden snitch bullshit.</v>

119
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.681
<v Speaker 1>I just want to say,</v>

120
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not my nickname.</v>

121
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>It's Brennan jobs.</v>

122
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>He came up with it 100% on his own.</v>

123
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.303
<v Speaker 1>He was going to ask you.</v>

124
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.423
<v Speaker 1>It's all good though.</v>

125
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.181
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

126
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:58.014
<v Speaker 1>It's all good.</v>

127
00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So a couple of funny stories about that.</v>

128
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:00.694
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

129
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>when did you come up with this?</v>

130
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 2>About a year ago at least.</v>

131
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

132
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 2>so people in the office started coming up to me saying,</v>

133
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:06.881
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

134
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:07.714
<v Speaker 2>golden snitch,</v>

135
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.620
<v Speaker 2>what the hell is that?</v>

136
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.780
<v Speaker 2>Doing a little research as she,</v>

137
00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:13.340
<v Speaker 2>something about Harry Potter,</v>

138
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 2>some character named there.</v>

139
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:14.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

140
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>what the hell does this have to do with me?</v>

141
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 2>So about a month ago,</v>

142
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 2>somebody lets me know,</v>

143
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:20.231
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

144
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>check out Wikipedia.</v>

145
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 2>So for whatever reason there's a Jeff Novitsky Wikipedia page.</v>

146
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 2>You go to that page now it says,</v>

169
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh shove,</v>

170
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 2>what have you done?</v>

171
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Just bdis locked in on me and I think this thing's going to kill me.</v>

172
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.040
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm thinking,</v>

173
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.290
<v Speaker 1>when I say I'm thinking,</v>

175
00:04:13.291 --> 00:04:14.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if I'm thinking,</v>

176
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.943
<v Speaker 1>I'm just,</v>

177
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I just remembered what I,</v>

178
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.970
<v Speaker 1>what was kind of going through my head at the time.</v>

179
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.700
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

180
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

181
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna die.</v>

182
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>And my protections right there,</v>

183
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

184
00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die.</v>

185
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.320
<v Speaker 1>This is that since situation where I'm dead.</v>

186
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 1>And they talk about it and he could have saved himself,</v>

187
00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:31.740
<v Speaker 1>but his guns on the ground.</v>

188
00:04:31.741 --> 00:04:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that was like,</v>

189
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>go for the gun was my whole thing.</v>

190
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.170
<v Speaker 1>So I start to go for the gun.</v>

191
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Yonis would've been here as I remember it.</v>

192
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.120
<v Speaker 1>And so I start to go for the gun and realize,</v>

193
00:04:42.121 --> 00:04:42.361
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

194
00:04:42.361 --> 00:04:46.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't have time to get to my gun and it's three feet away to that bears like</v>

195
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>right there coming down on me so fast.</v>

196
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So I kind of do like a football juke move left,</v>

197
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.123
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

198
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And then wheel around right.</v>

199
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Do like a spin with my back and they start running to the left.</v>

200
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.840
<v Speaker 1>And at that point Yonis it,</v>

201
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:00.971
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

202
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know this at the time because I looked at some pictures afterwards kind</v>

203
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>of piece everything together.</v>

204
00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:07.410
<v Speaker 1>So your honest was sitting right next to me.</v>

205
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I think he got up to turn.</v>

206
00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:10.770
<v Speaker 1>There were some trekking poles right here.</v>

207
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>He grabbed a trekking pole.</v>

208
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:13.770
<v Speaker 1>So probably while I was joking,</v>

209
00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.790
<v Speaker 1>he reached around and grabbed the trekking pole swings around,</v>

210
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.970
<v Speaker 1>hits the bear in the face.</v>

211
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>She's so then the IC,</v>

212
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 1>the bear running off.</v>

213
00:05:21.151 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 1>Then I see someone going down the mountain with the bear.</v>

214
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking he's got someone.</v>

215
00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:25.860
<v Speaker 1>So I grabbed my pistol,</v>

216
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:28.650
<v Speaker 1>start going down the mountain yelling,</v>

217
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh I Guess I,</v>

218
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.500
<v Speaker 1>I will count off.</v>

219
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.450
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's like one,</v>

220
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

221
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:33.170
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

222
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.571
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

223
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>

224
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 1>who's missing?</v>

225
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

226
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.610
<v Speaker 1>And then Garrett pops up out of the bushes and his eye,</v>

227
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.500
<v Speaker 1>he's like wide eyed.</v>

228
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.240
<v Speaker 1>So Garrett,</v>

229
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.871
<v Speaker 1>Ak dirt,</v>

230
00:05:41.871 --> 00:05:42.561
<v Speaker 1>dirt myth.</v>

231
00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:44.460
<v Speaker 1>He's the one who was on top of the,</v>

232
00:05:44.461 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 1>somehow he's on the barriers back.</v>

233
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.730
<v Speaker 1>So I think when the bear wheeled around you like hit him and he ends up on the</v>

234
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:51.001
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

235
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:54.030
<v Speaker 1>So I saw just legs and bear going down the mountain.</v>

236
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.940
<v Speaker 1>I saw his legs on the back of the bear somehow.</v>

237
00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe the bear had him in his job.</v>

238
00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.611
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

239
00:05:58.611 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was thinking.</v>

240
00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.871
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

241
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:00.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean who?</v>

242
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 1>Who would think</v>

243
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>like if that was in a movie,</v>

244
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:05.181
<v Speaker 1>you'd be like,</v>

245
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.014
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck outta here.</v>

246
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 1>What was that anchorman where the guy's like,</v>

247
00:06:09.341 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>you're riding the bear.</v>

248
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly like God.</v>

249
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

250
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>And then we just kind of circled up around the tree and the real scary part was</v>

251
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.260
<v Speaker 1>that bear.</v>

252
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>So it was so thick.</v>

253
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:23.180
<v Speaker 1>You really couldn't see.</v>

254
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

255
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>you could see maybe as far as the wall from us,</v>

256
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.470
<v Speaker 1>which was that the tree feet.</v>

257
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

258
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>And just real thick brush.</v>

259
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>And you'd hear the bear charge in again,</v>

260
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>and we only have the two pistols Yiannis and I and the,</v>

261
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

262
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>the wind was so strong,</v>

263
00:06:37.431 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>there's no way we could use bear spray.</v>

264
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>So we hear the bear charging in and me and Yanna like pistols out ready,</v>

265
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>waiting for this thing to pop out at point blank range.</v>

266
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 1>And then you would see in your were yelling,</v>

267
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.250
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

268
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.780
<v Speaker 1>and then that thing stops.</v>

269
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.793
<v Speaker 1>And then it would just,</v>

270
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.550
<v Speaker 1>it crash off and then it would charge in from the other direction.</v>

271
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.030
<v Speaker 1>She ain't gotta like circle around the tree the other way and did that,</v>

272
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:02.350
<v Speaker 1>I think three times.</v>

273
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.580
<v Speaker 1>That was just a nerd.</v>

274
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like a horror movie where it keeps coming in from different angles.</v>

275
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.230
<v Speaker 1>It was weird.</v>

276
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.030
<v Speaker 1>It was not a fun feeling.</v>

277
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:11.320
<v Speaker 1>You just felt so small.</v>

278
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
