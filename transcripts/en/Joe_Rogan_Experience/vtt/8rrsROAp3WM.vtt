<v Speaker 1>I've done one of those high intensity</v>

4
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>interval training things at a yoga place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>

5
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>You do some yoga and some like really</v>
<v Speaker 1>light weights,</v>

6
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>but all these crazy little exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fun too.</v>

7
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>We got a good dancer pose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a dancer pose.</v>

8
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.050

<v Speaker 1>you try to do that.</v>

11
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>Don't hurt yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

12
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is that what it's called?</v>

13
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Standing Bow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good things called standing bow and</v>

14

<v Speaker 1>there's this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep it going.</v>

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Are you going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one can see you.</v>

16
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to grab both legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Grab that other leg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she got it.</v>

18
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on son.</v>

19
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Here he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>

20
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>And the headphones on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take it to the new level.</v>

21
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>It's like a NASA mission called again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cry for help.</v>

22
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>I call it the crab.</v>

23
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 2>When you say you do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how often do you do it?</v>

24
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 2>When I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would go to hot yoga.</v>

25
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 2>You go a couple times a week are now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of do it in my backyard to</v>

26
00:01:17.081 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 2>stretch out after a long flight or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

27
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 2>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything you had the tank like that's a</v>

28
00:01:23.321 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 2>time to think about life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to think through it.</v>

29
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Think through a mission that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>working on.</v>

30
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 2>Some family issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like quiet your.</v>

31
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 2>It's about you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

32
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 2>Yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like giving yourself a massage.</v>

33
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 2>It's more gratifying than going to</v>

34
00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>can get real weights and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to stretch out before sets.</v>

35
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>You ever do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do stretches before we go do this.</v>

36
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>It feels real good that like there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about that that's very</v>

37
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 1>relaxing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puts you in a good.</v>

38
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I think you carry around when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>tight,</v>

39
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>you carry around a lot of tension that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't necessarily want.</v>

40
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Pigeon pose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where all the tension is.</v>

41
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 2>Pigeon pose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the one</v>

42
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 3>where your.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where your leg comes under your.</v>

43
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 1>I want to ask Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is he doing?</v>

44
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeff,</v>

45
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.181
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

46
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>I've seen this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

47
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called a hip opener.</v>

48
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.593
<v Speaker 1>Good hips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

49
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.300
<v Speaker 1>That looks so sad.</v>

50
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.340
<v Speaker 2>One like if you go to hot yoga and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people will do that pose and start</v>

51
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:25.710
<v Speaker 2>crying because there's so much emotion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anxiety release from the hitch,</v>

52
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 2>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just crying because someone told</v>

53
00:02:28.371 --> 00:02:29.204
<v Speaker 2>you you should cry.</v>

54
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.060
<v Speaker 1>You want to be a part of the group cry</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

55
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 1>They always want to say that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening up your colon.</v>

56
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no diagrams.</v>

57
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>You don't know where the colon is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better stop.</v>

58
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno when I fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like I'm fighting and yeah,</v>

59
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.530
<v Speaker 4>it's a poor shield in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

60
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes if it hurts enough,</v>

61
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 4>like when I got my ribs cracked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt that right.</v>

62
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 4>I can went through and I like disrupted</v>
<v Speaker 4>my for shield and so sometimes that's</v>

63
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:02.850
<v Speaker 4>something we'll go through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a good solid or shield four.</v>

64
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Shields will activate your attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your mindset is like you're fighting,</v>

65
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're ready to accept all sorts of</v>

66
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.220
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 4>Like I could die</v>
<v Speaker 4>or even harder.</v>

68
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 4>I could kill someone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think it'd be harder to kill someone</v>

69
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 4>than to die and so her on you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because then you think about their loved</v>

71
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 4>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so thinking about all the people that</v>

72
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 4>loved you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we fight.</v>

73
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 4>Think about all the people that love</v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

74
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when we fight,</v>

75
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't break any rules,</v>

76
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.090
<v Speaker 4>but I killed you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

77
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 4>Think about all your loved ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody that loves you that's attached</v>

78
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 4>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about that.</v>

79
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.873
<v Speaker 4>All that pain</v>

80
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 4>because of what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The you right.</v>

81
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 4>Even though I didn't break any rules,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you ever been in a promotion where</v>

82
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 4>someone died?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's heavy,</v>

83
00:03:56.441 --> 00:04:01.441
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think probably why a lot of fighters I</v>

84
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 4>have noticed like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

85
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the majority of fighters a</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at what they do with the gravity</v>

86
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it deserves.</v>

87
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you could kill somebody,</v>

88
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 4>like you need to think about that and be</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay with that.</v>

89
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Not Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just understand like,</v>

90
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that could happen and I'm going to be</v>

91
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 4>calm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>calm,</v>

92
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 4>consciously knowing this and choosing to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go forward.</v>

93
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.451
<v Speaker 4>They just think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

94
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll be fun.</v>

95
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:34.580
<v Speaker 4>It'll know whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or it'll be harder.</v>

96
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna like whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't think about these things.</v>

97
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 4>Is this something that you thought about</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were young?</v>

98
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Before I really got into it.</v>

99
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is something you've been</v>

100
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 4>contemplating even before you started</v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting,</v>

101
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 4>you were aware of all the possibilities?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

102
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.070
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

103
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.403
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say it.</v>

104
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.750
<v Speaker 4>So I was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was uh,</v>

105
00:04:56.751 --> 00:05:01.751
<v Speaker 4>about 28 I think and I don't think I had</v>
<v Speaker 4>my pro boxing debut yet and I took some</v>

106
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:09.331
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms and I was thinking somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 4>along the trip I started thinking about</v>

107
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 4>fighting and I started thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what could happen to me and I think</v>

108
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 4>it's thinking about the death of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I started thinking about what</v>

109
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 4>could happen with my opponent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what's worse than that?</v>

110
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.110
<v Speaker 4>And I thought about I could see somebody</v>
<v Speaker 4>I fight and I saw all the,</v>

111
00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like lines of gold thread attached into</v>

112
00:05:29.831 --> 00:05:32.200
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a from their loved ones.</v>

113
00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.100
<v Speaker 4>And then all the lines got snipped when</v>
<v Speaker 4>they died.</v>

114
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw this on this mushroom trip and I</v>

115
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:39.500
<v Speaker 4>was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

116
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 4>And so then when I decided to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's more intense,</v>

117
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and more commitment and more resolve.</v>

118
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 4>That's heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

119
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that is what it is.</v>

120
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's where I think real,</v>

121
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 4>there's more power.</v>

122
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.780
<v Speaker 5>This idea of a enforced equality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

123
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.820
<v Speaker 5>Ensuring that there is such a high</v>
<v Speaker 5>emphasis played or placed on equality,</v>

124
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.850
<v Speaker 5>equality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that you have the equal amount of men,</v>

125
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 5>the equal amount of women and the</v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunities are absolutely available</v>

126
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 5>as much to women as they are to men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is enforced that this creates an</v>

127
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 5>environment where there's less</v>
<v Speaker 5>resistance.</v>

128
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.270
<v Speaker 5>Now in an environment where there's less</v>
<v Speaker 5>resistance,</v>

129
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 5>perhaps women don't feel as compelled to</v>
<v Speaker 5>say,</v>

130
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:29.410
<v Speaker 5>I'll show you that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That is what seems to happen.</v>

131
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.050
<v Speaker 5>This is the key.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

132
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 5>here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there are fewer women mathematicians</v>

133
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 5>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the higher echelons.</v>

134
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 5>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But here's something interesting about</v>

135
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 5>mathematical ability.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

136
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 5>it's very rare.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that's the first thing to keep in</v>

137
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 5>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now it looks like if you look in junior</v>

138
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:51.101
<v Speaker 5>high that give mathematically gifted men</v>
<v Speaker 5>and males and females are approximately</v>

139
00:06:51.891 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 5>as common.</v>

140
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 5>Now there's a little bit of debate about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that because there is some evidence that</v>

141
00:06:55.881 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 5>maybe at the very upper extremes there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>a male advantage just like there's a</v>

142
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:03.650
<v Speaker 5>male disadvantage at the low end because</v>
<v Speaker 5>the mail distribution for intelligence</v>

143
00:07:03.651 --> 00:07:08.570
<v Speaker 5>might be flatter and so that's the</v>
<v Speaker 5>greater male variability hypothesis.</v>

144
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 5>There's been papers putting that forward</v>
<v Speaker 5>that had been retracted as a consequence</v>

145
00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 5>of pressure from politically correct</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

146
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 5>Even though greater male variability is</v>
<v Speaker 5>actually quite common in the animal</v>

147
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 5>kingdom for a variety of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Men are more expendable,</v>

148
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:23.450
<v Speaker 5>that males are more expendable in some</v>
<v Speaker 5>ways,</v>

149
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:27.980
<v Speaker 5>or you could say that males are more</v>
<v Speaker 5>likely to produce to pursue high risk,</v>

150
00:07:27.981 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 5>high return strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can look at it either way and it's</v>

151
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:32.390
<v Speaker 5>certainly possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In any case,</v>

152
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 5>the men,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the males in junior high who happened to</v>

153
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 5>be mathematically gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>are less likely to also be verbally</v>

154
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:40.544
<v Speaker 5>gifted.</v>

155
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.580
<v Speaker 5>Whereas that doesn't seem to be the case</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the females.</v>

156
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.820
<v Speaker 5>And so if you're a male math nerd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then math is pretty logical pathway for</v>

157
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 5>you because you don't have as many other</v>
<v Speaker 5>options.</v>

158
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.610
<v Speaker 5>Whereas if you're female math nerd,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have other options because you're,</v>

159
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 5>you're less likely,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're more likely to also be verbally</v>

160
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 5>gifted,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so that's enough to at least in</v>

161
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 5>principle account for some of the reason</v>
<v Speaker 5>why there are fewer women mathematicians</v>

162
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:07.010
<v Speaker 5>than men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mathematicians.</v>

163
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Speaker 5>They have other options.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have other options and there's lots</v>

164
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:13.130
<v Speaker 5>of complex.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's lots of complex reasons like</v>

165
00:08:13.131 --> 00:08:15.830
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and so we have this reflects of idea and</v>

166
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 5>this is very much the case because this</v>
<v Speaker 5>is like the core idea among the feminist</v>

167
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:24.620
<v Speaker 5>neo Marxist types is that if there's</v>
<v Speaker 5>differences in outcome,</v>

168
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.880
<v Speaker 5>that's that's proof of prejudice and</v>
<v Speaker 5>that support for the idea of the</v>

169
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:34.400
<v Speaker 5>patriarchal tyranny and that's like the</v>
<v Speaker 5>core axiom of the radical left is the</v>

170
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 5>patriarchal tyranny as far as I'm</v>
<v Speaker 5>concerned.</v>

171
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 5>That's God for them to patriarchal</v>
<v Speaker 5>tyranny.</v>

172
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.753
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

173
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 5>if it turns out that many of these</v>
<v Speaker 5>differences in outcome between men and</v>

174
00:08:44.361 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 5>women aren't a consequence of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>patriarchal tyranny,</v>

175
00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.710
<v Speaker 5>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even get bigger.</v>

176
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 5>When you reduce the tear radical aspect</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the patriarch and even the</v>

177
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:57.731
<v Speaker 5>patriarchal aspect to it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then it makes that theory not only wrong</v>

178
00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:03.240
<v Speaker 5>but opposite of the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the worst kind of wrong and so</v>

179
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if men are more likely to produce per</v>

180
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 5>pursue careers in the stem fields,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which seems to be the case under</v>

181
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 5>conditions of optimal freedom for men</v>
<v Speaker 5>and women,</v>

182
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 5>then that's going to drive income</v>
<v Speaker 5>disparities because the stem fields pay</v>

183
00:09:15.511 --> 00:09:18.330
<v Speaker 5>more and they pay more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Partly because they're scalable,</v>

184
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 5>like it's really hard to scale care for</v>
<v Speaker 5>people.</v>

185
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.280
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you work in a daycare,</v>

186
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 5>you're going to care for three infants.</v>

187
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.910
<v Speaker 5>You're not going to care for 50 because</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't.</v>

188
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 5>It's not scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if you're like a software designer,</v>

189
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 5>it's infinitely scalable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so there's,</v>

190
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.280
<v Speaker 5>there's a much wider range of possible</v>
<v Speaker 5>of possibility for generating much</v>

191
00:09:37.651 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 5>larger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>much larger income pools and much larger</v>

192
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:43.720
<v Speaker 5>pools of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

193
00:09:43.721 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 5>and men are also more likely to work</v>
<v Speaker 5>longer hours.</v>

194
00:09:45.931 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 5>And if you work 10 percent longer hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you make 40 percent more money.</v>

195
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 5>There's a nonlinear return on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's good thing for everybody who's</v>

196
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:55.740
<v Speaker 5>listening to know if you have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to be the guy or the woman</v>

197
00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:00.030
<v Speaker 5>who's working that extra 10 percent</v>
<v Speaker 5>because the return on that is nonlinear,</v>

198
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.770
<v Speaker 5>so that's a really useful thing to know</v>

199
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how it got</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguished,</v>

200
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:10.221
<v Speaker 1>were proud boys became this evil group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people and an Antifa is the good</v>

201
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I understand that.</v>

202
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Proud boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proud boys were infiltrated by white</v>

203
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:18.570
<v Speaker 1>nationalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi,</v>

204
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 1>White Supremacist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

205
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:23.250
<v Speaker 1>but those were constantly being</v>
<v Speaker 1>disavowed by Gavin.</v>

206
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Gavin never wanted any of that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is there a way.</v>

207
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.090
<v Speaker 1>How do you get in though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question because this is my.</v>

208
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>You saw my last comedy special</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

209
00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.260
<v Speaker 1>This is my criticism of a vegans is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's anything wrong with being a</v>

210
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Vegan is that when you have a group</v>
<v Speaker 1>where anybody can join,</v>

211
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get a certain amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiots,</v>

212
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a million people for sure</v>

213
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you have 100,000 fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has no getting around that.</v>

214
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you have a group where anybody can</v>

215
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:55.110
<v Speaker 1>join and you have a million people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that group,</v>

216
00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:58.360
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have 100,000 fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking idiots.</v>

217
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Those people are going to define your</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

218
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 1>The worst behavior in the group is where</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to call too as an</v>

219
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

220
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.160
<v Speaker 1>I think this is also a symptom of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media era today,</v>

221
00:11:08.161 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 1>especially with twitter because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't express yourself and explain</v>

222
00:11:12.031 --> 00:11:16.290
<v Speaker 1>things in 140 or 280 characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just takes too much time so they can</v>

223
00:11:16.291 --> 00:11:16.980
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

224
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.670
<v Speaker 1>proud boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist scumbag Nazi Gavin,</v>

225
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and they'll always a racist scumbag</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazi.</v>

226
00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden that's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative and everybody keeps pushing</v>

227
00:11:25.141 --> 00:11:27.960
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Videos of people punching little skinny</v>

228
00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:28.561
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

229
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:30.240
<v Speaker 1>look at these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They beat up the Antifa,</v>

230
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>these fucking assholes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Gavin's an asshole.</v>

231
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

232
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it presented a.</v>

233
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.440
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ask how it starts and how it grows</v>

234
00:11:40.441 --> 00:11:43.470
<v Speaker 1>and how you become a member by buying a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shirt.</v>

235
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.370
<v Speaker 1>That's by buying a Perry Ellis shirt and</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening a chapter two.</v>

236
00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>There are chapters worldwide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it.</v>

237
00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:52.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the the proud boys,</v>

238
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's England proud boys,</v>

239
00:11:55.271 --> 00:12:00.271
<v Speaker 1>fucking Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's everywhere and it never was</v>

240
00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:05.281
<v Speaker 1>supposed to get to that point and</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of how these people act,</v>

241
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.860
<v Speaker 1>it now reflects on Gavin even though he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to hang out in a bar with a few</v>

242
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>people do is public speaking without</v>
<v Speaker 1>being hassled and that's it.</v>

243
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>And I see the way the media manipulates</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

244
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:23.731
<v Speaker 1>I've been party to it myself and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen Gavin presented in photos where you</v>

245
00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:26.320
<v Speaker 1>look and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck.</v>

246
00:12:26.321 --> 00:12:27.550
<v Speaker 1>It's Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

247
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:29.280
<v Speaker 1>like they get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one picture,</v>

248
00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Gavin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was petrified by.</v>

249
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 1>He's got his arms folded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got a scowl on his face,</v>

250
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 1>that hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the short on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long on the top and he's looking like</v>

252
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>he's angry and I'm like that.</v>

253
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:44.320
<v Speaker 1>That's not the guy that him and his wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's American Indian by the way.</v>

254
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.740
<v Speaker 1>His wife is American Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got beautiful kids that come over</v>

255
00:12:47.741 --> 00:12:50.590
<v Speaker 1>my house and use the pool and we hang</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and barbecue.</v>

256
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not that guy.</v>

257
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 1>No one knows that guy from the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're getting this impression.</v>

258
00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>He's a really nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's.</v>

259
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:03.850
<v Speaker 1>He's a generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a really cool guy to hang out with</v>

260
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:08.080
<v Speaker 1>and what you see them do in the media is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just crazy.</v>

261
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you know he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>invent some Goddamn Nazi group.</v>

262
00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.300
<v Speaker 1>He was just trying to have a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>outrageous fun and it ran from him.</v>

263
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.280
<v Speaker 1>It got away from them.</v>
