3
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>controversial after our podcasts because during the manhood training camp,</v>

<v Speaker 1>My Dad and I had like a weird relationship went dead and I had like a falling</v>

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>10 or 12 years ago.</v>

10
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't spoken 10 years.</v>

11
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.483
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15

16
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.713
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

17
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>was one of the biggest things that Vinny helped me work on it.</v>

18
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I found out my dad had cancer and like my reaction when my brother and sister</v>

19
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>told me it was like fucking like,</v>

20

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Like we had like a really bad issues.</v>

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>at some point.</v>

36
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>And Vinny,</v>

37
00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.031
<v Speaker 1>did some,</v>

39
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

40
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.490
<v Speaker 1>he called a timeline therapy and we had the,</v>

41
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:03.324
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>this is not at all I was planning on talking about,</v>

43
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:05.371
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

44
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.511
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

46
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>he asked me all of these scenarios like,</v>

48
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 1>think of a time in your life when you were really proud and then think of a time</v>

49
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>when you were really upset and like all these different emotions and he didn't</v>

50
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>know what he was,</v>

51
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>what it was about or what was going to happen.</v>

52
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>He's just trying it on in every,</v>

53
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they talked about was my dad.</v>

54
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Like every one of those times was a time with my dad.</v>

55
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.991
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

56
00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:25.824
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>he did like the,</v>

58
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>the whole session or whatever.</v>

60
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.233
<v Speaker 1>At the end of it,</v>

61
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I just had no more resentment or anger towards my dad and it was really weird.</v>

62
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.611
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

63
00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>it was like this chip on my shoulder like my whole life.</v>

65
00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.071
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

66
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>at one point for a long time.</v>

68
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>I used to think about my dad before I would fight,</v>

70
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>when I was fighting professionally.</v>

71
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:46.044
<v Speaker 1>Like I would use,</v>

72
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily like I'm fighting my dad but like to shove it up his ass.</v>

73
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:49.291
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

74
00:01:49.291 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>look what I'm gonna do,</v>

75
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

76
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.331
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

77
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:52.164
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.850
<v Speaker 1>I realized that like,</v>

79
00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>that anger that I had and that I've used to tap into all the time was actually</v>

80
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>like coding me back and was almost like a handicap.</v>

81
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.733
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

82
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

83
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:03.144
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

84
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>when he helped me forgive my dad,</v>

85
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.151
<v Speaker 1>I was able to,</v>

86
00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>go to Florida as,</v>

88
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>he's just got stage four cancer,</v>

90
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 1>he's going to die.</v>

91
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.341
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

92
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>I had a relationship with my dad for the last year before he died that I hadn't</v>

94
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>had in 10 years and that was from that Vinnie helped me do that.</v>

95
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>That's got to have a big impact on the way you raise your own sons.</v>

96
00:02:26.371 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

97
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.653
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

98
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.090
<v Speaker 1>Knowing the resentment that you had towards your father and the anger and the,</v>

99
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>the bad relationship,</v>

100
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>like never wanting it to get to that place.</v>

101
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

102
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

103
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.773
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

104
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.650
<v Speaker 1>it was weird,</v>

105
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.483
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

106
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.383
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Vinny didn't know that he was,</v>

108
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.660
<v Speaker 1>that that was even going to be the result and he was just like,</v>

109
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:43.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

110
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I want to try this timeline therapy thing on you.</v>

111
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.433
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

112
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.801
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

113
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I went from like completely hating him to like just can forgiving him</v>

114
00:02:50.071 --> 00:02:50.611
<v Speaker 1>completely,</v>

115
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:54.300
<v Speaker 1>not like halfass for giving him to like waiting for that apology.</v>

116
00:02:54.301 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Like there was no apology.</v>

117
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>There was no talking about it.</v>

118
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 1>It was like completely starting over.</v>

119
00:02:57.931 --> 00:02:58.764
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

120
00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.351
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

121
00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>we had like a really good</v>

122
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>relationship for that last year before he died.</v>

123
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.781
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

124
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

125
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I knew that he was,</v>

126
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>he was battling cancer.</v>

127
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>My brother started treating him.</v>

128
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>He was stage four.</v>

129
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.381
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

130
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it was the doctor's like,</v>

131
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:12.791
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>as your dad's going to die,</v>

133
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>he had cancer and as long as cancer in his brain cancer in his chest and she</v>

134
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>cancer in his neck,</v>

135
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>he had like this giant mass.</v>

136
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:20.854
<v Speaker 1>I was neck.</v>

137
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.581
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

138
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.414
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.060
<v Speaker 1>my brother started treating him with CBD oil and,</v>

140
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:25.894
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>allegedly I was shipping it to him from here and to Florida or whatever.</v>

142
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 1>But that was probably wasn't very good.</v>

143
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.171
<v Speaker 1>It allegedly,</v>

144
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>allegedly there was fiction for Fisher friction operational purposes.</v>

145
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

146
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.211
<v Speaker 1>and we,</v>

147
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:37.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148

149
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.961
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

150
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I guess seven months probably.</v>

151
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.081
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

152
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:44.914
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

153
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.271
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

154
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:47.104
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

155
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't going to chemo,</v>

156
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.800
<v Speaker 1>he just didn't want to do it.</v>

157
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>He was like really stubborn.</v>

158
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm stubborn.</v>

159
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Guy wouldn't do that.</v>

160
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:53.974
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

161
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.611
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

162
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:55.444
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>they tested him,</v>

164
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>they did like a graph or whatever to see where the cancer had grown or whatever</v>

165
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>

166
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And they were shocked that 90% of the cancer had died,</v>

167
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>that there was 90% of the cancer was dead and 10% of the cancer that was still</v>

168
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>alive was like completely surrounded in dead cells so that they couldn't get</v>

169
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.330
<v Speaker 1>even medicine to it and it couldn't grow.</v>

170
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.700
<v Speaker 1>And it was just gonna he was gonna have to live with it,</v>

171
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.563
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>but it was completely surrounded by dead cancer cells.</v>

173
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing possibly that could have done it was the CBD oil because he</v>

174
00:04:26.501 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>was doing nothing else correctly.</v>

175
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.291
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

176
00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:30.124
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

177
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:04:30.341 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>they had them on so many narcotics and pain pills and stuff that he was,</v>

179
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a asshole to be around.</v>

180
00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>It was really hard.</v>

181
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>It was like constantly on like this drug thing.</v>

182
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

183
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't eat.</v>

184
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>He only wanted to eat was like chocolate cake and ice cream,</v>

185
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.441
<v Speaker 1>like wouldn't,</v>

187
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>it was like really hard ad for cancer.</v>

188
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:47.404
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

189
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.041
<v Speaker 1>we're like,</v>

190
00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:48.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

191
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

192
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>trying to get them to the right supplements in and,</v>

193
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:51.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

194
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.621
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>

195
00:04:52.621 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>it was a tough situation,</v>

196
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.161
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

197
00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:54.341
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:04:54.341 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>the CBD oil was,</v>

199
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 1>was beating the cancer and the cancer wasn't what killed him.</v>

200
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:02.761
<v Speaker 1>He actually died from like starvation or mount nourishment from not doing what</v>

201
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>we would beg him to do really well.</v>

202
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>90% of the cancer was dead CBD oil people.</v>

203
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.963
<v Speaker 1>It really works.</v>

204
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Working right now from my friend's mom,</v>

205
00:05:11.771 --> 00:05:14.170
<v Speaker 2>my friend's mom has stage four cancer and her brain,</v>

206
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

207
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 2>I allegedly got them some CBD oil and uh,</v>

208
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.500
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

209
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.920
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

210
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.753
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

211
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 2>got it to his mom.</v>

212
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

213
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>within less than two months,</v>

214
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.390
<v Speaker 2>her cancer had shrunk by 30% that she had been doing chemo and they were saying</v>

215
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 2>that her immune system was so devastated by the chemo,</v>

216
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 2>the chemo is probably going to kill her quicker than the cancer was.</v>

217
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 2>And they'd recommended her stopping chemo and he was just in full desperation</v>

218
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 2>mode.</v>

219
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:40.301
<v Speaker 2>My friends,</v>

220
00:05:40.301 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 2>real super straight edge,</v>

221
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.821
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>

222
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:43.421
<v Speaker 2>he's just,</v>

223
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 2>Mr Republican American doesn't,</v>

225
00:05:46.271 --> 00:05:46.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 2>thinks Obama's a Muslim,</v>

227
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:52.300
<v Speaker 2>that kind of guy and it never would want to have anything to do with CBD oil or</v>

228
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:52.661
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

229
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis.</v>

230
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.560
<v Speaker 2>I got it to him and now his mom can sleep.</v>

231
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 2>She's eating,</v>

232
00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 2>she sleeps at night.</v>

233
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.250
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't have pain anymore or tumor shrinking.</v>

234
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 2>The doctors are astounded.</v>

235
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.441
<v Speaker 2>Those stories,</v>

236
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 2>you hear so many of them,</v>

237
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they seem like anecdotal fairy tales because until it's,</v>

238
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 2>it happened to someone you actually know and care about and then you go and then</v>

239
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 2>you start getting angry.</v>

240
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.061
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

241
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 2>this is what these God damn assholes that are making laws in this country and</v>

242
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 2>fighting against as the lobbyists and the people that are working for the</v>

243
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies that are actively trying to suppress this information.</v>

244
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 2>You are keeping one of the best ways to,</v>

245
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 2>to heal these people.</v>

246
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.870
<v Speaker 2>You're keeping it illegal and it's,</v>

247
00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 2>it's a fucking horrible crime</v>

248
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.670
<v Speaker 1>and they won't even tell you about it,</v>

249
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:34.930
<v Speaker 1>which is just atrocious.</v>

250
00:06:34.931 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

251
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.810
<v Speaker 1>my dad is there giving my brother the talk that my dad is,</v>

252
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.370
<v Speaker 1>is going to die and it's,</v>

253
00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:40.630
<v Speaker 1>it's terminal and you know,</v>

254
00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:42.910
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff for,</v>

255
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:06:43.571 --> 00:06:44.500
<v Speaker 1>weeks and weeks and weeks.</v>

257
00:06:44.501 --> 00:06:45.580
<v Speaker 1>He's going to the doctor.</v>

258
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:46.990
<v Speaker 1>And finally my brother's like,</v>

259
00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:47.201
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

260
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:48.070
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

261
00:06:48.071 --> 00:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>what about,</v>

262
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.170
<v Speaker 1>medical marijuana,</v>

264
00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:51.060
<v Speaker 1>is that something that,</v>

265
00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.790
<v Speaker 1>and they were like,</v>

266
00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:52.151
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

267
00:06:52.151 --> 00:06:53.950
<v Speaker 1>we can prescribe him Marinol,</v>

268
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:54.813
<v Speaker 1>but we just can't,</v>

269
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:06:55.211 --> 00:06:58.570
<v Speaker 1>there's no question that the cannabis or Thc,</v>

271
00:06:58.571 --> 00:06:59.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

272
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

273
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.480
<v Speaker 1>cannabis helps fight cancer,</v>

274
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:02.314
<v Speaker 1>but we can't,</v>

275
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.071
<v Speaker 1>we can't refer.</v>

276
00:07:03.071 --> 00:07:03.671
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask.</v>

277
00:07:03.671 --> 00:07:04.900
<v Speaker 1>We can't just offer it to you.</v>

278
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And then they gave him that the,</v>

279
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:07.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

280
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.260
<v Speaker 1>prescription for Marinol,</v>

281
00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>which is like the government pharmaceutical form of the pill,</v>

282
00:07:13.121 --> 00:07:15.180
<v Speaker 1>which is probably where weaker than the two year old.</v>

283
00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.023
<v Speaker 1>And we were giving him,</v>

284
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.080
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

285
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.390
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

286
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>not nearly as good.</v>

287
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.001
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

288
00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:20.320
<v Speaker 1>like we got the call,</v>

289
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:23.440
<v Speaker 1>I got the call from my dad or my brother that my dad had passed away.</v>

290
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.383
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

291
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it was three weeks before the,</v>

292
00:07:26.111 --> 00:07:26.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:27.700
<v Speaker 1>the Melvin Madoff fight.</v>

294
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.350

424
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:53.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

425
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 1>whether you're religious or not at some level somewhere you think your,</v>

426
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:58.500
<v Speaker 1>your cousin and your father,</v>

427
00:09:58.501 --> 00:09:59.190
<v Speaker 1>what would they want?</v>

428
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.671
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

429
00:09:59.671 --> 00:10:00.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

430
00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I talked to both of them about the fight.</v>

431
00:10:01.501 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 1>They were both excited about the fight.</v>

432
00:10:02.671 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 1>I knew what they were going to want.</v>

433
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 1>So I just kind of turned off that emotion until after the fight.</v>

434
00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>And when I knocked out Melvin,</v>

435
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.673
<v Speaker 1>there's like this,</v>

436
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.020
<v Speaker 1>this was this moment right after,</v>

437
00:10:13.021 --> 00:10:17.260
<v Speaker 1>like the referee stops it at like fucking explode and there's bullets worth post</v>

438
00:10:17.261 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>the picture all the time.</v>

439
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.860
<v Speaker 1>But like at that moment was like all of that emotion that I had turned off like</v>

440
00:10:21.861 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 1>came back right at that moment.</v>

441
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:23.903
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

442
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:24.540
