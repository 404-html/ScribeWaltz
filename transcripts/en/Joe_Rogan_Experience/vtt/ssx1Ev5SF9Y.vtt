9
00:00:14.621 --> 00:00:15.191
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

10
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:15.551
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live.</v>

11
00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:16.384
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

12
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm here with my good pal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan Callahan.</v>

13
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.710
<v Speaker 2>How are you buddy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing swell.</v>

14
00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:21.544
<v Speaker 2>How are you doing his good pal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ken Kruth met you before at the first </v>

15
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 2>light booth at the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show those the first time I met you,</v>

16
00:00:26.951 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

17
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And we wanted to have you guys on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all because I like,</v>

19
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 2>I love your company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys got a great company.</v>

20
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Firstlight makes really cool hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>

21
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 2>outdoor clothes made out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started out with Merino wool,</v>

22
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:41.434
<v Speaker 2>which I think uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I went with Ryan and Steven </v>

23
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.023
<v Speaker 2>Rinella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really had no idea about the </v>

24
00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 2>properties of Merino wool.</v>

25
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that it keeps you from </v>
<v Speaker 2>stinking that it,</v>

26
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.940
<v Speaker 2>that it really retains heat while you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>wet.</v>

27
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's got so many awesome properties </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it,</v>

28
00:00:57.161 --> 00:00:59.080
<v Speaker 2>like if you go out for people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

29
00:00:59.081 --> 00:00:59.914
<v Speaker 2>that don't go in the outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go out and you walk and it's </v>

30
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:06.040
<v Speaker 2>cold out and you hike like a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>distance and you get sweaty,</v>

31
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.860
<v Speaker 2>if you're wearing cotton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of fucked.</v>

32
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 2>If it's really cold out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you start getting sweaty,</v>

33
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 2>your body starts shivering and you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a real bad place.</v>

34
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.903
<v Speaker 2>We'll has this really weird quality and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can help me explain that </v>

35
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.490
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it gets wet,</v>

36
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 2>it somehow or another still retains </v>
<v Speaker 2>heat.</v>

37
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 2>So if you sweat in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still feel okay,</v>

38
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I kinda know what's going on there.</v>

39
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

40
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just naturally moves the sweat off of</v>

41
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:33.144
<v Speaker 3>your skin and kind of tries to get it to</v>
<v Speaker 3>the outermost layer and at which point </v>

42
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 3>then it can evaporate fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

43
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.691
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

44
00:01:39.691 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 3>she passed to live in crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>environments,</v>

45
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.613
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll be hotter than shit in the </v>

46
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 3>summertime and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

47
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>super cold in the winter.</v>

48
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

49
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 3>over the course of evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got,</v>

50
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.803
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a coat that will deal with a massive </v>

51
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.270
<v Speaker 3>amount of variance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

52
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 3>and will was pretty much the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like you can wear it when it's,</v>

53
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 3>when you're sweating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bullets at pulls a sweat off and then,</v>

54
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dries pretty quickly,</v>

55
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 3>but even when it's wet it pretends to 80</v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of its heat.</v>

56
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>

57
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.523
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is there a synthetic material that </v>

58
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:12.980
<v Speaker 2>does the same thing?</v>

59
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.813
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every synthetic is trying to a mimic </v>

60
00:02:16.311 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>down or be mimicked Merino wool because </v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the two most efficient,</v>

61
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.533
<v Speaker 1>temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regulating fabrics or materials out </v>

63
00:02:26.331 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

64
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how you got into your prima lofts</v>

65
00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:30.904
<v Speaker 1>and your all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your military testing and that's where </v>

66
00:02:33.261 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you saw synthetics really take off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like a prima law for example,</v>

68
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>or some of your fleeces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they basically,</v>

69
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.433
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>combined something that loves water and </v>

70
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:47.774
<v Speaker 1>something that hates water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that love loves water is </v>

71
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:51.014
<v Speaker 1>going to pull moisture off and the thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hates it is going to repel it and </v>

72
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:55.040
<v Speaker 1>try to push it to the outside.</v>

73
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like sort of a two layer process</v>

74
00:02:58.341 --> 00:02:59.174
<v Speaker 2>where something's trying to keep you dry</v>
<v Speaker 2>and something is trying to like </v>

75
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:02.914
<v Speaker 2>literally suck up the wet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a sponge and then somehow or </v>

76
00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 2>another your body heat then can regulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because your body heat,</v>

77
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.073
<v Speaker 2>you're staying warm because the dry is </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to your skin and then the heat </v>

78
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 2>comes off your skin and it can dry out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff better.</v>

79
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.391
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

80
00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:19.680
<v Speaker 3>In your body heat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like your natural,</v>

81
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your natural zone,</v>

82
00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:27.090
<v Speaker 3>how much heat and how much moisture you </v>
<v Speaker 3>push out is a major factor.</v>

83
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially when you get into some of</v>

84
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 3>your waterproof breathable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

85
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.060
<v Speaker 3>membranes and things like that.</v>

86
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.093
<v Speaker 2>That's something that I think really </v>
<v Speaker 2>would surprise a lot of people when it </v>

87
00:03:41.281 --> 00:03:42.114
<v Speaker 2>comes to hunting clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really would have no idea like how </v>

88
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.100
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much,</v>

89
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.570
<v Speaker 2>how technical the stuff is and how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought is put into it.</v>

90
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.770
<v Speaker 2>And how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

91
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:55.710
<v Speaker 2>like involve the processes of creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>this stuff.</v>

92
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:56.663
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because we all kind of came </v>

93
00:03:58.081 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 3>from the traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like ski,</v>

94
00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Speaker 3>snowboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>snowmobile world,</v>

95
00:04:01.561 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grew up skiing.</v>

96
00:04:03.571 --> 00:04:06.410
<v Speaker 3>And so we've been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

97
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.570
<v Speaker 3>involved in having super technical </v>
<v Speaker 3>clothes since I was eight years old.</v>

98
00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

99
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.230
<v Speaker 3>All the underwear stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Merino wool,</v>

100
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.123
<v Speaker 3>all the different policies when that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kinda came out and replaced cotton when </v>

101
00:04:19.141 --> 00:04:21.150
<v Speaker 3>I was a kid and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

102
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.163
<v Speaker 3>they were great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't until we kind of started </v>

103
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 3>using marina that we found something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

104
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

105
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 3>if you go skiing or snowboarding or some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sledding snowmobiling,</v>

106
00:04:32.401 --> 00:04:33.234
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sweating bullets and if you get </v>

107
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:35.670
<v Speaker 3>stinky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

108
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:37.470
<v Speaker 3>it's just how it always was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

109
00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:40.470
<v Speaker 3>But for hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a really a big deal,</v>

110
00:04:40.471 --> 00:04:41.304
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you can possibly kind of shrink your </v>

111
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:44.724
<v Speaker 3>stink footprint just by a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be the difference between </v>

112
00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:49.150
<v Speaker 3>succeeding that season or not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

113
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:52.490
<v Speaker 3>And so we all started wearing Marino for</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

114
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of the other sports,</v>

115
00:04:53.761 --> 00:04:55.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like skiing and snowboarding and,</v>

116
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pedal,</v>

117
00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:57.150
<v Speaker 3>bike and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and whatever.</v>

118
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.293
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once we found out that it didn't </v>

119
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 3>stink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was like,</v>

120
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a big deal,</v>

121
00:05:02.371 --> 00:05:03.204
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you could wear it for days and </v>

122
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:06.630
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that was kind of the impetus.</v>

123
00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:08.610
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time I started taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>over,</v>

124
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.400
<v Speaker 3>I would say the traditional outdoor </v>
<v Speaker 3>space,</v>

125
00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:12.031
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

126
00:05:12.031 --> 00:05:12.590
<v Speaker 3>And you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody</v>

127
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 2>is really popular with public land do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

128
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:17.363
<v Speaker 2>Hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guys who go out backpacking for long </v>

129
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:21.304
<v Speaker 2>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons why they </v>

130
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:23.314
<v Speaker 2>liked that Merino wool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the reasons why I wanted you </v>

131
00:05:24.601 --> 00:05:25.434
<v Speaker 2>to have you guys on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talk about what's been going on </v>

132
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 2>lately with a hr six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>21 and now hr six slash 22.</v>

133
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 2>These two recent bills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pulled her 6:21,</v>

134
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Steven Rinella wrote a big article about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

135
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:37.564
<v Speaker 2>But for the uninitiated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what these bills are about is there </v>

136
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.363
<v Speaker 2>about selling off our public land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving the states the ability to do </v>

137
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 2>whatever they want with it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these lands or federal,</v>

138
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 2>they're owned by the people of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

139
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a very unusual situation that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have here.</v>

140
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:54.994
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing situation and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very few countries in the world that </v>

141
00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:58.814
<v Speaker 2>have anything even remotely close to it </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's millions and millions and </v>

142
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 2>millions of acres that are available for</v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody listening to this to go on you.</v>

143
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.383
<v Speaker 2>It's literally your land like back </v>
<v Speaker 2>country hunters and anglers have that </v>

144
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:10.694
<v Speaker 2>great shirt that I wear all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says public land owner and I've seen </v>

145
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:13.454
<v Speaker 2>you on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm going to tweet the picture of </v>

146
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:19.181
<v Speaker 2>you and I from shot show where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was with you and you were wearing that</v>

147
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:20.490
<v Speaker 2>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

148
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.473
<v Speaker 2>That's such an important point for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people because I didn't know it at all </v>

149
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 2>until I went with you guys until I went </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Rinella and the crew.</v>

150
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to Montana.</v>

151
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 2>That first trip with Brian Kaplan who's </v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully coming.</v>

152
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 2>That's why that door's open,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>

153
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.963
<v Speaker 2>if you're watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're leaving that door open because </v>

154
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Collin is trying to make his way over </v>
<v Speaker 2>here right now,</v>

155
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.913
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't know that this public land </v>
<v Speaker 2>system even existed and I think most </v>

156
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 2>people are unaware.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't.</v>

157
00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:50.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't understand how unique this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how incredible like the,</v>

158
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.370
<v Speaker 2>our forefathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like their,</v>

159
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.213
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their vision to make something so </v>

160
00:06:55.011 --> 00:06:58.850
<v Speaker 2>incredible that no one can go in and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fucking put malls up in</v>

161
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>it is an amazing thing and I think this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like the easiest battle in the world.</v>

162
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.334
<v Speaker 1>If we can somehow tell people your kid </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate even a fraction of our </v>

163
00:07:11.331 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

164
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>it is the reason I get up in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

165
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.813
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially where you guys are </v>

166
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys are like,</v>

167
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.133
<v Speaker 2>you're in the boondocks man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you guys are in Idaho and you're </v>

168
00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 2>in a beautiful area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could literally like go out your</v>

169
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:34.731
<v Speaker 2>back door and make a straight line </v>
<v Speaker 2>through public land for forever.</v>

170
00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.710
<v Speaker 2>Like you could just go walk and </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappear.</v>

171
00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.613
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

172
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.410
<v Speaker 1>we can walk straight north and cross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

173
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two highways and one interstate and keep</v>

174
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:47.884
<v Speaker 1>going across the Canadian border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cross to more highways and be in the </v>

175
00:07:52.871 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Yukon basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a wild junker ground.</v>

176
00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.100
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

177
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And it's open to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>

178
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

179
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.030
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting issue because </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you know,</v>

180
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:04.864
<v Speaker 1>you'll get mountain bikers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get after the equestrian people or </v>

181
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:08.884
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

182
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:12.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hikers get after the motor bikers,</v>

183
00:08:12.281 --> 00:08:13.114
<v Speaker 1>but it's an issue for every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>person because no matter what sport you </v>

184
00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>do or how you choose to enjoy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>outdoors,</v>

185
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 1>that's your land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once that's gone,</v>

186
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.153
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>

187
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean and there are regulations like as</v>

188
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:29.970
<v Speaker 2>far as where you can take motorbikes or </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you can ride even bikes,</v>

189
00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even trail bikes,</v>

190
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.950
<v Speaker 2>but that set aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

191
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 2>there's some amazing country that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could just go get lost in.</v>

192
00:08:38.451 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Just go wander,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pitch a tent,</v>

193
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.263
<v Speaker 2>drink out of a stream and you could stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>there for long periods of time and it's </v>

194
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>totally legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally yours.</v>

195
00:08:46.731 --> 00:08:47.564
<v Speaker 2>Your tax dollars literally fund and </v>
<v Speaker 2>support it and all the money that comes </v>

196
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.274
<v Speaker 2>from buying hunting equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from buying tags from all that stuff is </v>

197
00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:57.534
<v Speaker 2>what pays to keep fishing game employed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes sure that people are monitoring </v>

198
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.614
<v Speaker 2>the health and the populations of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals that live there and making sure </v>

199
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 2>that no one is breaking any laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

200
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 2>it's really an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing system.</v>

201
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.170
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's unreal.</v>

202
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:17.230
<v Speaker 1>And I want to clarify a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

203
00:09:17.231 --> 00:09:19.690
<v Speaker 1>You like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these national forests.</v>

204
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm at any blm grounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have their own regulations.</v>

205
00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.164
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have of land management for </v>

206
00:09:28.361 --> 00:09:31.750
<v Speaker 1>folks that drill weekend manager.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys are deep on the inside.</v>

207
00:09:31.751 --> 00:09:33.160
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people listen to us on a,</v>

208
00:09:33.161 --> 00:09:35.380
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

209
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:39.580
<v Speaker 1>So different for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have different regulations as far as how</v>

210
00:09:39.581 --> 00:09:42.700
<v Speaker 1>long you can stay camped in one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

211
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.653
<v Speaker 1>typically it's 10 to 15 days and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to move again depending on </v>

212
00:09:49.601 --> 00:09:52.720
<v Speaker 1>where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>X amount of,</v>

213
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's 100 feet,</v>

214
00:09:54.821 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's 20 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

215
00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.340
<v Speaker 1>and then you can set up camp again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just arbitrary rules.</v>

216
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:01.563
<v Speaker 1>It is not arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some smart folks out there that </v>

217
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm study the impact of man on the land </v>

<v Speaker 1>their federal mandate is to manage that </v>
<v Speaker 1>land for everyone.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in the summertime we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

235
00:10:57.171 --> 00:11:00.110
<v Speaker 3>we'll ride mountain bikes and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wintertime backcountry skiing.</v>

236
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:01.970
<v Speaker 3>It's all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

237
00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:03.920
<v Speaker 3>and then hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course it's huge.</v>

238
00:11:03.921 --> 00:11:04.754
<v Speaker 3>But you just see it from all angles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like places that where you recreate 365 </v>

239
00:11:11.031 --> 00:11:11.864
<v Speaker 3>days a year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden you start to get sucked </v>

240
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:15.440
<v Speaker 3>up and it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute,</v>

241
00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:16.280
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

242
00:11:16.281 --> 00:11:18.890
<v Speaker 3>like if this wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we didn't have public lands,</v>

243
00:11:18.891 --> 00:11:20.360
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have a business,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

244
00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.440
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

245
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.140
<v Speaker 3>it would just wouldn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

246
00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.693
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our board of trustees didn't say it's </v>

247
00:11:27.131 --> 00:11:29.450
<v Speaker 1>high time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

248
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.520
<v Speaker 2>look at the United States being only </v>
<v Speaker 2>founded in 17,</v>

249
00:11:32.521 --> 00:11:37.500
<v Speaker 2>76 and you just look at the massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of land we occupy now with.</v>

250
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.353
<v Speaker 2>There's just a greater Los Angeles area </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's 30 million people and you </v>

251
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:42.114
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go up all through the Pacific coast </v>

252
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:44.574
<v Speaker 2>highway and just see all the cities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see all the buildings and see all the </v>

253
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:47.934
<v Speaker 2>stuff that you would encounter if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to try to drive from California to </v>

254
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:52.644
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that's stopping that </v>

255
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:55.444
<v Speaker 2>whole fucking area from being covered </v>
<v Speaker 2>with buildings and malls and gas </v>

256
00:11:58.571 --> 00:11:59.404
<v Speaker 2>stations and anything else they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick in there is the fact that it's </v>

257
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:04.190
<v Speaker 2>public land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that.</v>

258
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.093
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's federally owned land and you can't </v>

259
00:12:06.911 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 2>build on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some folks that want.</v>

260
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:09.600
<v Speaker 2>They want it.</v>

261
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.433
<v Speaker 1>We drove that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it trip Panga Topanga Canyon </v>

262
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.540
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

263
00:12:15.541 --> 00:12:17.160
<v Speaker 1>there's a good looking house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

264
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's houses everywhere in here.</v>

265
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:20.903
<v Speaker 1>And then we came around the corner and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sign that says open space x </v>

266
00:12:24.811 --> 00:12:26.160
<v Speaker 1>amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

267
00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:27.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover that to open space up.</v>

268
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:33.040
<v Speaker 2>Gary said that open space that opened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wonder what they mean by that.</v>

269
00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.160
<v Speaker 2>Whenever it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

270
00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.540
<v Speaker 2>orange sign on it right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>

271
00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 2>like a park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

272
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:42.980
<v Speaker 2>like a for sale sign for sale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still Open.</v>

273
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of development up there.</v>

274
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.480
<v Speaker 2>Topanga is very unusual though because </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you live in Los Angeles,</v>

275
00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 2>you could be in Topanga and look like </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the woods.</v>

276
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got gotta say,</v>

277
00:12:54.011 --> 00:12:56.590
<v Speaker 2>and then right now it's all greened up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful right now.</v>

278
00:12:56.591 --> 00:12:57.424
<v Speaker 2>It's spectacular right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would trick you if you came </v>

279
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:01.120
<v Speaker 2>here from somewhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

280
00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:02.830
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the most beautiful place ever.</v>

281
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 2>When you come back in August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

283
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:07.954

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

287
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.880
<v Speaker 1>we opted to go over the specific coast </v>
<v Speaker 1>highway and then come over that way.</v>

288
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.193

<v Speaker 2>but it was a house that Jimi Hendrix </v>

<v Speaker 5>Then you read into it and then you start</v>

351
00:16:05.371 --> 00:16:06.204
<v Speaker 5>looking into this public land system </v>
<v Speaker 5>that we have and how unique and </v>

352
00:16:08.761 --> 00:16:10.110
<v Speaker 5>beautiful it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you just go,</v>

353
00:16:10.111 --> 00:16:11.700
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to sell that.</v>

354
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.580
<v Speaker 5>And Paul Ryan had proposed that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

355
00:16:14.581 --> 00:16:16.590
<v Speaker 5>Didn't he propose selling it off to pay </v>
<v Speaker 5>some,</v>

356
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.330
<v Speaker 5>some of the land off to pay for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>debt.</v>

357
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:22.280
<v Speaker 4>It's something that comes up all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all too frequently because,</v>

358
00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:22.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

359
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:23.504
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

360
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 4>it's something that we've watched,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

361
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 4>state by state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by state.</v>

362
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.880
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you know,</v>

363
00:16:28.881 --> 00:16:29.714
<v Speaker 4>it's like you get a bad fire season.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm all of a sudden you're up to your </v>

364
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:38.120
<v Speaker 4>eyeballs in debt and it's raised taxes </v>
<v Speaker 4>or it's sell off some land,</v>

365
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.730
<v Speaker 4>sell off some land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So short,</v>

366
00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:40.910
<v Speaker 4>shortsighted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

367
00:16:40.911 --> 00:16:44.580
<v Speaker 4>when you think about the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this land</v>

368
00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 5>could not be there for your children or </v>
<v Speaker 5>your children's children.</v>

369
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.330
<v Speaker 5>Like it's been for us and it's been for </v>
<v Speaker 5>our grandparents.</v>

370
00:16:50.331 --> 00:16:52.610
<v Speaker 5>I mean it says an amazing system that we</v>
<v Speaker 5>have here.</v>

371
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.520
<v Speaker 4>And what is her six slash 22 k?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Hr six,</v>

372
00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.600
<v Speaker 4>22 is</v>

373
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.500
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is very black and white.</v>

374
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.860
<v Speaker 1>It's basically to remove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

375
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:08.320
<v Speaker 1>federal law enforcement officers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elios,</v>

376
00:17:08.830 --> 00:17:09.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

377
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:10.803
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blm has its own law enforcement </v>

378
00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 1>officers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

379
00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.870
<v Speaker 1>forest service has its own law </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement officers,</v>

380
00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.093
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remove those and then give county law </v>

381
00:17:20.711 --> 00:17:22.240
<v Speaker 1>enforcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

382
00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:25.930
<v Speaker 1>the authority to enforce laws on</v>

383
00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.570
<v Speaker 4>the federally managed lands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh.</v>

384
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.690
<v Speaker 4>So if their resources are tight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which they are,</v>

385
00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.123
<v Speaker 4>they probably wouldn't stop poachers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They probably wouldn't do a good job of </v>

386
00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:39.610
<v Speaker 4>keeping people of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

387
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:41.190
<v Speaker 4>making a mess out of the place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

388
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.490
<v Speaker 4>And</v>

389
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.490
<v Speaker 1>basically what it does is it sets the </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal land system up to fail.</v>

390
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like a booby trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

391
00:17:48.241 --> 00:17:49.560
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to pull,</v>

392
00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>

393
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.520
<v Speaker 1>all these resources out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then five years later it's like,</v>

394
00:17:53.521 --> 00:17:54.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what a disaster it is.</v>

395
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:56.650
<v Speaker 1>Now it's moving to state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

396
00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:02.330
<v Speaker 2>It's weakening the structure of it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>facilitate a collapse.</v>

397
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:02.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

398
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.693
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing against county law </v>

399
00:18:06.551 --> 00:18:09.040
<v Speaker 1>enforcement here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>

400
00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:09.890
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.970
<v Speaker 1>you go grab your local sheriff or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheriff's deputy and say,</v>

402
00:18:12.971 --> 00:18:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

403
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.273
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many mushrooms can I pull off of </v>

404
00:18:16.331 --> 00:18:18.080
<v Speaker 1>this burden on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

405
00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.980
<v Speaker 1>the siebler national forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

406
00:18:20.981 --> 00:18:22.360
<v Speaker 1>that guy is going to look at you cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyed,</v>

407
00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

408
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.483
<v Speaker 1>ask them how many cords of wood you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go up and cut for your fireplace in the </v>

409
00:18:27.911 --> 00:18:28.940
<v Speaker 1>winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

410
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.150
<v Speaker 1>the guy's not going to have a clue </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not,</v>

411
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:35.230
<v Speaker 1>not as job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bigger fish to fry got totally different</v>

412
00:18:35.231 --> 00:18:36.100
<v Speaker 1>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

413
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.870
<v Speaker 1>From federal state for federal versus </v>
<v Speaker 1>state and yeah,</v>

414
00:18:38.871 --> 00:18:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a different job.</v>

415
00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:41.763
<v Speaker 2>Now explain to people what is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between Blm and the other </v>

416
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:47.130
<v Speaker 2>organizations that control</v>

417
00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.420
<v Speaker 1>public land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

418
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:51.540
<v Speaker 1>So beautiful in management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

419
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.320
<v Speaker 1>So the homestead act or at a go west </v>
<v Speaker 1>young man,</v>

420
00:18:55.321 --> 00:18:58.230
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets a 140 acres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

421
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.533
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically we got pushed a lot of </v>

422
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:06.740
<v Speaker 1>people out onto this big open space </v>
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

423
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the east needed money,</v>

424
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.653
<v Speaker 1>so you really need to populate these </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas and start the economy rolling </v>

425
00:19:13.321 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

426
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.013
<v Speaker 1>the basically that area's that failed </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a large chunk of the Missouri </v>

427
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:21.024
<v Speaker 1>breaks his block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>land management or bureau land </v>

428
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:24.640
<v Speaker 1>management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

429
00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:29.750
<v Speaker 1>the areas that failed and were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitable became blm ground.</v>

430
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And basically the impetus a blm is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

431
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.133
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more revenue focused then your </v>

432
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>forest service lands are so blm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

433
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.240
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more focused towards grazing.</v>

434
00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Lisa's like oil and gas grazing</v>

435
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.280
<v Speaker 2>and the grazing lease was the big thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the bundys.</v>

436
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.143
<v Speaker 2>That was the big thing up in Oregon </v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's a standoff with the </v>

437
00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:02.420
<v Speaker 2>rangers and all that jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking chaos</v>

438
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.180
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they owed a ton of money.</v>

439
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they didn't,</v>

440
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to pay it.</v>

441
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:09.470
<v Speaker 1>They always a ton of money.</v>

442
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still do.</v>

443
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:13.400
<v Speaker 2>But how does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we've been on hunts before,</v>

444
00:20:13.401 --> 00:20:15.980
<v Speaker 2>like we were recently with Rinella and </v>
<v Speaker 2>crew.</v>

445
00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:19.570
<v Speaker 2>We're in Nevada and we're on a mule deer</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunt and you know,</v>

446
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you'd be stocking on a mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these fucking cows were everywhere.</v>

447
00:20:22.671 --> 00:20:25.490
<v Speaker 2>I mean everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you were hunting cows,</v>

448
00:20:25.491 --> 00:20:27.830
<v Speaker 2>boy you will be gold in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

449
00:20:27.831 --> 00:20:30.380
<v Speaker 2>we're eating good tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And cows everywhere.</v>

450
00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.860
<v Speaker 2>But we were hunting deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to get away from the fucking</v>

451
00:20:33.861 --> 00:20:37.070
<v Speaker 2>cows to get to the deer and the cows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sometimes spook.</v>

452
00:20:37.071 --> 00:20:37.904
<v Speaker 2>And then the deer would realize that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cow saw something and they would boil </v>

453
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Boeing where the cows are going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>check you out.</v>

454
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.010
<v Speaker 2>He would step in cow shit everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

455
00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:47.920
<v Speaker 2>this is so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How are these,</v>

456
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.810
<v Speaker 2>how does this work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

457
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:53.020
<v Speaker 2>they were trying to explain to me that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people just sort of let these cows</v>

458
00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.990
<v Speaker 2>wander.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've found that in Montana as well.</v>

459
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:56.883
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we just let their cows wander all </v>

460
00:20:57.971 --> 00:20:59.440
<v Speaker 2>over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they round them up.</v>

461
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something.</v>

462
00:21:00.811 --> 00:21:02.720
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

463
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.550
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people have,</v>

464
00:21:05.551 --> 00:21:08.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these programs in place to where we</v>

465
00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.700
<v Speaker 1>lease that ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

466
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say more often than not,</v>

467
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:20.690
<v Speaker 1>if not a 100 percent of the time far </v>
<v Speaker 1>below market value to uh,</v>

468
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:22.733
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rancher and it's right of first </v>

469
00:21:23.731 --> 00:21:25.470
<v Speaker 1>refusal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first guy to say,</v>

470
00:21:25.471 --> 00:21:26.304
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to graze my cattle on this </v>

471
00:21:26.881 --> 00:21:27.714
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's his name is going to be on the </v>

472
00:21:29.191 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 1>lease until he doesn't want it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

473
00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.430
<v Speaker 1>and it comes up for renewal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

474
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

475
00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 1>there's a range land biologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

476
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.550
<v Speaker 1>who go out and they say this is how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>days and how many,</v>

477
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

478
00:21:46.831 --> 00:21:48.420
<v Speaker 1>animal cow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calf units,</v>

479
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:49.933
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be grazed on this area for this </v>

480
00:21:53.101 --> 00:21:53.510
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

481
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:55.940
<v Speaker 2>And doesn't that affect local wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well?</v>

482
00:21:55.941 --> 00:21:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Because I would assume if you're having </v>
<v Speaker 2>your animals graze on the land,</v>

483
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.193
<v Speaker 2>they're eating a lot of stuff that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer would eat or maybe a lot of the </v>

484
00:22:02.511 --> 00:22:03.344
<v Speaker 2>other wildlife would eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you gotta keep in mind Ma'am is a </v>

485
00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.230
<v Speaker 2>tough call.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

486
00:22:06.231 --> 00:22:06.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

487
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:07.530
<v Speaker 1>for we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

488
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.300
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the low lands,</v>

489
00:22:09.301 --> 00:22:10.134
<v Speaker 1>it's the antelope and the and the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the antelope and the cows live </v>

490
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.050
<v Speaker 1>pretty harmoniously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

491
00:22:16.051 --> 00:22:17.020
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

492
00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:21.440
<v Speaker 1>if there's a lot of grand day used to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of cow feed and you know,</v>

493
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.520
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could help when done properly it,</v>

494
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.830
<v Speaker 1>it works really well because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

495
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.750
<v Speaker 1>basically our beef has replaced our </v>
<v Speaker 1>bison or buffalo.</v>

496
00:22:30.751 --> 00:22:35.190
<v Speaker 1>So there was a major grazer out there </v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to the beef being out there.</v>

497
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

498
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:39.270
<v Speaker 1>super dance grasslands are good for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

499
00:22:39.271 --> 00:22:40.560
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:22:40.561 --> 00:22:45.210
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes your upland birds need open </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>

501
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

502
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:47.783
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

503
00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:51.840
<v Speaker 1>picking up scratch and it's better for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the bugs and a number of reasons.</v>

504
00:22:51.841 --> 00:22:55.740
<v Speaker 1>So when that systems respected and done </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

505
00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

506
00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.120
<v Speaker 1>it's good for everybody or it can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for everybody.</v>

507
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are your opinions that you,</v>

508
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.353
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you guys are aware of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole American Serengeti project that </v>

509
00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:05.744
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to do in the midwest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country or in the middle of this </v>

510
00:23:08.091 --> 00:23:10.220
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really quite fascinating.</v>

511
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.353
<v Speaker 2>They're trying to buy up private land </v>
<v Speaker 2>and turn it into what they think was </v>

512
00:23:16.821 --> 00:23:20.690
<v Speaker 2>essentially like what America was before</v>
<v Speaker 2>people came here.</v>

513
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I am not,</v>

514
00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not super studied up on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

515
00:23:23.981 --> 00:23:25.870
<v Speaker 1>that is kind of the nuts and bolts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

516
00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's going to be privately held,</v>

517
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.270
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say nature concern,</v>

518
00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:34.220
<v Speaker 2>American prairie reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it is right there.</v>

519
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.050
<v Speaker 2>This is a little piece on it that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>jamie just pulled up,</v>

520
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:44.051
<v Speaker 2>but they want to reintroduce bison like </v>
<v Speaker 2>wild bison all through out areas.</v>

521
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:46.880
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Montana,</v>

522
00:23:46.881 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 2>Wyoming is a bunch of different areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

523
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.453
<v Speaker 2>Where is it?</v>

524
00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:50.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately it's bigger than just being </v>

525
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:55.030
<v Speaker 1>talked about in a number of different </v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

526
00:23:55.031 --> 00:23:57.970
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is kind of the traditional,</v>

527
00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

528
00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:06.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the Oklahoma,</v>

529
00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.090
<v Speaker 1>South Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Dakota,</v>

530
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.540
<v Speaker 1>like the true prairie region there</v>

531
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.460
<v Speaker 2>where it used to be like giant herds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>buffalo wandering through the land.</v>

532
00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:18.503
<v Speaker 2>They want to recreate that and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>also gonna open up block management on </v>

533
00:24:21.331 --> 00:24:22.050
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

534
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.883
<v Speaker 2>So this is going to be an area like once</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets established and once there's </v>

535
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.633
<v Speaker 2>populations of animals there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then people are going to be allowed to </v>

536
00:24:28.171 --> 00:24:29.010
<v Speaker 2>hunt those animals.</v>

537
00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean if,</v>

538
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.170
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

539
00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't been super studied up on it,</v>

540
00:24:34.361 --> 00:24:36.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love the idea man.</v>

541
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>

542
00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:38.363
<v Speaker 2>translating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that they're doing this and </v>

543
00:24:39.491 --> 00:24:40.324
<v Speaker 2>buying a private land as right now being</v>
<v Speaker 2>used for whatever and they're going to </v>

544
00:24:43.811 --> 00:24:46.620
<v Speaker 2>turn it into public land and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to allow people to,</v>

545
00:24:46.621 --> 00:24:47.201
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go.</v>

546
00:24:47.201 --> 00:24:48.034
<v Speaker 2>Then you're going to be able to see like</v>
<v Speaker 2>great herds of bison roaming through </v>

547
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:52.480
<v Speaker 2>some of these states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

548
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.343
<v Speaker 2>That's going to be incredible and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something we always talk about on this </v>

549
00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.960
<v Speaker 2>land transfer stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

550
00:24:57.961 --> 00:24:59.170
<v Speaker 2>once it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>

551
00:24:59.171 --> 00:25:01.510
<v Speaker 2>So if these guys are out there trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make some more of it.</v>

552
00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say good on them.</v>

553
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:06.610
<v Speaker 2>They literally are trying to make more </v>
<v Speaker 2>public land,</v>

554
00:25:06.611 --> 00:25:08.900
<v Speaker 2>which is kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do about Predator?</v>

555
00:25:08.901 --> 00:25:09.734
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to bring in predators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they're going to bring in wolves and </v>

556
00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.630
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're going to say that Jim,</v>

557
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.353
<v Speaker 2>here we go.</v>

558
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.383
<v Speaker 2>Does the APR at 10?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intend to reintroduce predators such as </v>

559
00:25:19.181 --> 00:25:20.110
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grizzly bears,</v>

560
00:25:20.111 --> 00:25:23.260
<v Speaker 2>which are historically present in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>region as a non.</v>

561
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.223
<v Speaker 2>As a private nonprofit organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American prairie reserve does not have </v>

562
00:25:27.101 --> 00:25:27.934
<v Speaker 2>the authority to reintroduce species to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the area even at those species were </v>

563
00:25:30.941 --> 00:25:31.774
<v Speaker 2>historically present.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Species reintroduction falls under the </v>

564
00:25:34.031 --> 00:25:34.864
<v Speaker 2>jurisdiction of Montana fish and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wildlife parks and slash or the US fish </v>

565
00:25:37.961 --> 00:25:38.794
<v Speaker 2>and wildlife service in any decisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>regarding the reintroduction of wolves </v>

566
00:25:41.201 --> 00:25:42.034
<v Speaker 2>or grizzlies in the region will need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be made by these agencies augmented by </v>

567
00:25:45.821 --> 00:25:48.210
<v Speaker 2>the will of the general public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

568
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're reintroducing grizzlies have tubs.</v>

569
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:54.420
<v Speaker 2>Xcel people like going for it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

570
00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:55.700
<v Speaker 2>I'd Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy,</v>

571
00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:56.573
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>An area that you and I were in Missouri </v>

572
00:25:58.231 --> 00:25:59.290
<v Speaker 1>breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

573
00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:01.500
<v Speaker 1>that's east of the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

574
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

575
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.630
<v Speaker 1>they every other year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they catch some loaner.</v>

576
00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Typically a young male is way out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prairie and it just looks like he's just</v>

577
00:26:14.941 --> 00:26:17.670
<v Speaker 1>kind of naturally getting funneled down </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Missouri breaks,</v>

578
00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:18.810
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

579
00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.810
<v Speaker 1>as historic range for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

580
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.050
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the way he'd gets his </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

581
00:26:25.051 --> 00:26:28.800
<v Speaker 1>gets the best of them and he knocks over</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sheep and that's kind of the end of</v>

582
00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.860
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the same thing,</v>

583
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.820
<v Speaker 1>wolves are going to come whether you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it or not.</v>

584
00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you guys feel about wolves?</v>

585
00:26:34.751 --> 00:26:35.584
<v Speaker 2>Because you guys are in Idaho and Idaho </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a really interesting relationship </v>

586
00:26:38.141 --> 00:26:40.840
<v Speaker 2>with wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas a real love hate relationship,</v>

587
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.970
<v Speaker 2>like I gotta imagine it's to be cool as </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck to be out at night here.</v>

588
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.860
<v Speaker 6>Interesting sets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Amazing.</v>

589
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.753
<v Speaker 6>So at first hairstyle banks or was it </v>
<v Speaker 6>before you could hunt wolves and before </v>

590
00:26:55.441 --> 00:26:58.880
<v Speaker 6>that was it was totally unchecked.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It it.</v>

591
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 6>The elk hunting sucked</v>

592
00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.053
<v Speaker 2>as they killed all the up because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>came in and didn't know what was going </v>

593
00:27:03.161 --> 00:27:03.994
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They hadn't had wolves there in a long </v>

594
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:06.504
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Over 100 years and then explain to </v>

595
00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:08.584
<v Speaker 2>people that there's a reintroduction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves into the yellowstone region in </v>

596
00:27:10.961 --> 00:27:12.820
<v Speaker 2>1990 something or nothing.</v>

597
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:16.680
<v Speaker 6>Maybe it was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not positive when it started,</v>

598
00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:17.350
<v Speaker 6>but then</v>

599
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:18.183
<v Speaker 2>voted on either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a really controversial subject </v>

600
00:27:19.901 --> 00:27:20.734
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sportspeople and also among wildlife </v>

601
00:27:22.481 --> 00:27:23.314
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of wildlife people completely </v>

602
00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:26.410
<v Speaker 2>support it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think it balances out the ecosystem</v>

603
00:27:26.411 --> 00:27:27.244
<v Speaker 2>and that the undulates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the elk and the deer were running </v>

604
00:27:29.321 --> 00:27:34.000
<v Speaker 2>rampant and they were destroying a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the grasses and the plants that would</v>

605
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.750
<v Speaker 2>like provide homes for a lot of other </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

606
00:27:37.751 --> 00:27:39.910
<v Speaker 2>And this whole thing was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbalanced,</v>

607
00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.890
<v Speaker 6>just like with beef man overgrazing bat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Absolutely,</v>

608
00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.000
<v Speaker 6>but are so,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

609
00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:48.680
<v Speaker 6>prior to us being able to hunt them and </v>
<v Speaker 6>stuff,</v>

610
00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.030
<v Speaker 6>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

611
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.090
<v Speaker 6>it really was skewed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I had no idea how to deal with the wolf.</v>

612
00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:58.110
<v Speaker 6>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a pack of wolves would come in the bowl,</v>

613
00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:03.150
<v Speaker 6>a bowl would go out and try to fend off </v>
<v Speaker 6>the wolves and it would just get crushed</v>

614
00:28:04.391 --> 00:28:05.020
<v Speaker 6>by the wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

615
00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.700
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a bull elk,</v>

616
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.943
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

617
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:08.870
<v Speaker 6>Full boil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

618
00:28:08.871 --> 00:28:09.704
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But now a days after maybe living </v>

619
00:28:12.221 --> 00:28:13.630
<v Speaker 6>together for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

620
00:28:13.631 --> 00:28:16.150
<v Speaker 6>I've seen this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's my happening in my neighborhood,</v>

621
00:28:16.151 --> 00:28:16.984
<v Speaker 6>like as we speak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's wolves in my neighborhood right </v>

622
00:28:18.521 --> 00:28:20.860
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it literally,</v>

623
00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.380
<v Speaker 6>you can tell when the wolves around the </v>
<v Speaker 6>elk,</v>

624
00:28:23.381 --> 00:28:25.870
<v Speaker 6>they pot up kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

625
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.770
<v Speaker 6>kind of get into a circle and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>try to go out and fight one on one.</v>

626
00:28:29.771 --> 00:28:30.604
<v Speaker 6>They'll just sit there and the wolves </v>
<v Speaker 6>will kind of come in and they work </v>

627
00:28:33.671 --> 00:28:34.504
<v Speaker 6>together.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>

628
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:35.350
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and,</v>

629
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.640
<v Speaker 6>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's an interesting,</v>

630
00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.680
<v Speaker 6>it's an interesting rl cuttings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Quite good.</v>

631
00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.570
<v Speaker 6>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and the elk don't run,</v>

632
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.580
<v Speaker 6>don't run.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't split off.</v>

633
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.920
<v Speaker 6>They've kind of figured out this </v>
<v Speaker 6>symbiosis,</v>

634
00:28:44.921 --> 00:28:47.230
<v Speaker 6>like how to live with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

635
00:28:47.231 --> 00:28:49.060
<v Speaker 6>it's an interesting thing that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>fascinating</v>

636
00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.630
<v Speaker 2>because they always did live with </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves,</v>

637
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:52.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until people came along and.</v>

638
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Well in Elvis tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elves,</v>

639
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:59.630
<v Speaker 2>what am I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where my mind is elk.</v>

640
00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.150
<v Speaker 2>Traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before people came around,</v>

641
00:29:02.151 --> 00:29:05.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a debate as to whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were mountain animals at all.</v>

642
00:29:05.211 --> 00:29:07.040
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were probably spent more time</v>

643
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.340
<v Speaker 6>store starved going through the Nez </v>
<v Speaker 6>perce territory,</v>

644
00:29:12.341 --> 00:29:13.250
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like they,</v>

645
00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.810
<v Speaker 6>there are so little game in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mountains when they were out there.</v>

646
00:29:16.811 --> 00:29:19.330
<v Speaker 6>That's one of the major arguments for </v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

647
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.340
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

648
00:29:21.341 --> 00:29:22.330
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>

649
00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.590
<v Speaker 6>there were animals covering the prairies</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

650
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.120
<v Speaker 6>if you believe everywhere to those </v>
<v Speaker 6>lyrics,</v>

651
00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.040
<v Speaker 6>Lewis and Clark,</v>

652
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.690
<v Speaker 2>what kind of makes sense if you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

653
00:29:32.691 --> 00:29:33.524
<v Speaker 2>because if you see the way they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>adapting to wolves and every animal </v>

654
00:29:35.721 --> 00:29:38.540
<v Speaker 2>adapts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a crazy documentary right</v>

655
00:29:38.541 --> 00:29:40.130
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is a little bit off topic,</v>

656
00:29:40.131 --> 00:29:41.950
<v Speaker 2>but on Netflix rats,</v>

657
00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:45.640
<v Speaker 5>it is so fucking disturbing if you </v>
<v Speaker 5>haven't seen it,</v>

658
00:29:45.641 --> 00:29:46.990
<v Speaker 5>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's called,</v>

659
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 5>it's called rat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've heard about Morgan spurlock,</v>

660
00:29:49.601 --> 00:29:53.680
<v Speaker 5>the guy who did supersize,</v>
<v Speaker 5>me and a bunch of other documentaries.</v>

661
00:29:53.681 --> 00:29:58.090
<v Speaker 5>He created this woo rats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like their gross.</v>

662
00:29:58.091 --> 00:29:59.230
<v Speaker 5>Everybody knows her gross,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

663
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:00.064
<v Speaker 5>just when they start pulling Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did catch a bunch of rats start </v>

664
00:30:03.191 --> 00:30:04.024
<v Speaker 5>polling parasites out and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well this one will kill you if you have </v>

665
00:30:05.501 --> 00:30:07.630
<v Speaker 5>an open wound and this gets on you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're black.</v>

666
00:30:07.631 --> 00:30:08.464
<v Speaker 5>Plague comes from Ras.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they pulled a bot fly out of this </v>

667
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:13.810
<v Speaker 5>one rad that was literally the size of </v>
<v Speaker 5>its head.</v>

668
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.350
<v Speaker 5>It's just this gigantic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then at the end of it,</v>

669
00:30:17.351 --> 00:30:18.184
<v Speaker 5>they kind of explained like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guys who's an exterminator explains how </v>

670
00:30:21.221 --> 00:30:22.054
<v Speaker 5>smart rats on how much they adapt and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they'll do is if there's poison or </v>

671
00:30:26.531 --> 00:30:27.430
<v Speaker 5>if there's traps.</v>

672
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.473
<v Speaker 5>They literally the smart rats,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the older rats will hang back and </v>

673
00:30:31.121 --> 00:30:31.954
<v Speaker 5>they'll let a young,</v>
<v Speaker 5>weaker rat go towards the food and you </v>

674
00:30:35.051 --> 00:30:35.460
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he,</v>

675
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:38.140
<v Speaker 5>he gets his fucking head crushed by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>trap and they go,</v>

676
00:30:38.141 --> 00:30:38.974
<v Speaker 5>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I thought something was fucked up about </v>

677
00:30:39.941 --> 00:30:40.930
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's get outta here.</v>

678
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:44.290
<v Speaker 5>And in the union never killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All like to be able to kill them all.</v>

679
00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:48.340
<v Speaker 5>The most effective method that they were</v>
<v Speaker 5>using this documentary was dogs.</v>

680
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:49.563
<v Speaker 5>They had a bunch of terriers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was all these little cute little </v>

681
00:30:53.531 --> 00:30:54.364
<v Speaker 5>dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

682
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.200
<v Speaker 5>little cute little dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He would think,</v>

683
00:30:56.201 --> 00:30:57.070
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a little sweetie.</v>

684
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:59.200
<v Speaker 5>Those little fucking Jack Russell </v>
<v Speaker 5>terriers,</v>

685
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:02.560
<v Speaker 5>those little suckers were meant to kill </v>
<v Speaker 5>rats.</v>

686
00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.423
<v Speaker 5>That's why they made them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they just run after these rats and </v>

687
00:31:06.101 --> 00:31:09.670
<v Speaker 5>they're all ripping them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was ruthless and brutal,</v>

688
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:10.923
<v Speaker 5>but it just highlights the adaptation </v>
<v Speaker 5>that animals undergo when there's </v>

689
00:31:15.971 --> 00:31:16.804
<v Speaker 5>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any kind of pressure makes them adapt </v>

690
00:31:19.121 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 5>and change and they just sort of figure </v>
<v Speaker 5>out what the fuck the problem is.</v>

691
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:23.940
<v Speaker 5>The Grand Canyon on the way.</v>

692
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:27.320
<v Speaker 4>I grabbed a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There it is.</v>

693
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 5>This is a scene in it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

694
00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:31.090
<v Speaker 5>there we go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look at those things.</v>

695
00:31:31.091 --> 00:31:32.500
<v Speaker 5>Your pith.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God.</v>

696
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:34.450
<v Speaker 5>These little fuckers are monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

697
00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.613
<v Speaker 5>They just crushed these rats and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>rip them apart like they played tug of </v>

698
00:31:38.471 --> 00:31:40.360
<v Speaker 5>war with these rats.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

699
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:42.580
<v Speaker 5>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is not in the movie,</v>

700
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:43.870
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is just something else.</v>

701
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:46.660
<v Speaker 5>Just on youtube called riding or riding.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

702
00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:47.494
<v Speaker 5>And this is how they read the </v>
<v Speaker 5>countrysides of rats and like really </v>

703
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:51.840
<v Speaker 5>heavy area.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't eat them though.</v>

704
00:31:51.841 --> 00:31:52.674
<v Speaker 5>They just crush them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well sometimes they eat them in the </v>

705
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:55.600
<v Speaker 5>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were eating some of them.</v>

706
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:56.530
<v Speaker 5>Speaking to the</v>

707
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.640
<v Speaker 4>parasite side of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Kevin and I were cruising down.</v>

708
00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.940
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where were you last night?</v>

709
00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.720
<v Speaker 4>See the Kardashians?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ventura Boulevard?</v>

710
00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is a possum.</v>

711
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.540
<v Speaker 4>Cal grabbed positive by the tail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it might have been.</v>

712
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.350
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't help myself as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've ever seen a good idea at the time.</v>

713
00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.050
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen a possum before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never seen a boss.</v>

714
00:32:19.051 --> 00:32:21.390
<v Speaker 4>How's that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in the woods 300 days a year.</v>

715
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.910
<v Speaker 4>Awesome man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

716
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.773
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I grabbed the thing by the tail and </v>

717
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:27.720
<v Speaker 4>because I wanted to see if it played </v>
<v Speaker 4>dad.</v>

718
00:32:27.721 --> 00:32:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

719
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.073
<v Speaker 4>The thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then immediately I just ran inside </v>

720
00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.940
<v Speaker 4>wash my hands because I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

721
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm in La and I grabbed a pause,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pause guides for sure.</v>

722
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.050
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of AIDS.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the adaptation is a</v>

723
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:43.040
<v Speaker 2>hundred percent true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those elk,</v>

724
00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:43.933
<v Speaker 2>God punished when the wolves were coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the scene and they just figured it </v>

725
00:32:48.501 --> 00:32:49.334
<v Speaker 2>out and figured out that they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>punished by people and they moved into </v>

726
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:53.630
<v Speaker 2>the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They realize,</v>

727
00:32:53.631 --> 00:32:54.890
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people though,</v>

728
00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:55.743
<v Speaker 2>the lazy ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to pull up in their truck and </v>

729
00:32:56.751 --> 00:32:59.810
<v Speaker 2>fucking shoot off the hood and just stay</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from cars.</v>

730
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:00.680
<v Speaker 2>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey guys,</v>

731
00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:03.440
<v Speaker 2>let's go up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hard for them to go up here.</v>

732
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:06.350
<v Speaker 2>They get tired is not that much air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go higher.</v>

733
00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:09.840
<v Speaker 6>The wolves are super smart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't mess around,</v>

734
00:33:09.841 --> 00:33:12.840
<v Speaker 6>like if once the bullets started flying </v>
<v Speaker 6>they would,</v>

735
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:13.883
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they were,</v>

736
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

737
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.900
<v Speaker 6>there's a wolf quota and rarely in our </v>
<v Speaker 6>unit does it get met,</v>

738
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:19.950
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's</v>

739
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.650
<v Speaker 2>explain that to people that are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>uninitiated.</v>

740
00:33:22.651 --> 00:33:26.340
<v Speaker 2>So what it is is the wildlife biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a really controversial topic</v>

741
00:33:26.341 --> 00:33:27.174
<v Speaker 2>because when they reintroduced wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a target population they </v>

742
00:33:30.091 --> 00:33:33.510
<v Speaker 2>wanted to reach and they felt like we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could reintroduce these wolves.</v>

743
00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.344
<v Speaker 2>And what's interesting is they got them </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Canada and the guy that trapped </v>

744
00:33:36.721 --> 00:33:39.870
<v Speaker 2>them that the legend holds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just found the nastiest,</v>

745
00:33:39.871 --> 00:33:40.980
<v Speaker 2>biggest like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

746
00:33:40.981 --> 00:33:42.720
<v Speaker 2>you guys want to bring waltz?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because in Canada,</v>

747
00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.780
<v Speaker 2>like where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I got this Moose in BC,</v>

748
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.930
<v Speaker 2>they have so many wolves that Mike Hawk </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridge,</v>

749
00:33:48.931 --> 00:33:50.820
<v Speaker 2>my buddy lives up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of his neighbors,</v>

750
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.010
<v Speaker 2>they took out a cow and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

751
00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:54.893
<v Speaker 2>they'll just get these big packs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just fucking attack things and </v>

752
00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.060
<v Speaker 2>roll in it.</v>

753
00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:03.060
<v Speaker 6>At least for that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A pack of four small nine of them and.</v>

754
00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:06.250
<v Speaker 6>But at one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not like some Wolf Hater,</v>

755
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:06.701
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

756
00:34:06.701 --> 00:34:07.120
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

757
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.520
<v Speaker 6>By any means,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's,</v>

758
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.830
<v Speaker 6>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They are gnarly predators,</v>

759
00:34:11.831 --> 00:34:13.570
<v Speaker 6>like I've seen them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

760
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.470
<v Speaker 6>kill stuff and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

761
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.680
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting to me how people have </v>
<v Speaker 6>this real soft spot for wolves.</v>

762
00:34:19.681 --> 00:34:23.140
<v Speaker 6>Like they're amazing creatures and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>can do amazing things.</v>

763
00:34:23.141 --> 00:34:27.460
<v Speaker 6>They can travel amazing distances but </v>
<v Speaker 6>nice they are not and it's not like this</v>

764
00:34:27.461 --> 00:34:30.040
<v Speaker 6>furry kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're pissed.</v>

765
00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:30.963
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people think of them as dogs because </v>

766
00:34:31.991 --> 00:34:32.824
<v Speaker 2>they look a lot like huskies that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think of them as some beautiful forest </v>

767
00:34:35.231 --> 00:34:37.840
<v Speaker 2>creature that lives this natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence and they do,</v>

768
00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:43.170
<v Speaker 2>but they're also fucking ruthless </v>
<v Speaker 2>predators and they are the only Predator</v>

769
00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:47.200
<v Speaker 2>in North America like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that size that operates in packs.</v>

770
00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.210
<v Speaker 2>And that's some scary shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

771
00:34:49.211 --> 00:34:50.044
<v Speaker 2>Coyotes kind of do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are a lot smaller and you </v>

772
00:34:51.871 --> 00:34:52.680
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

773
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:56.680
<v Speaker 2>they're more going after rodents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Fonz and little things that they can get</v>

774
00:34:56.681 --> 00:34:57.514
<v Speaker 2>ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wolves will take out a fucking full </v>

775
00:34:58.481 --> 00:35:02.560
<v Speaker 2>blown elk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've come across it kill and it's that</v>

776
00:35:02.561 --> 00:35:06.080
<v Speaker 2>thing did not die in any sort of a nice </v>
<v Speaker 2>disney sort of way.</v>

777
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:10.870
<v Speaker 2>Boy and amaze back to the front when we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in,</v>

778
00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.073
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bc in that place where I was getting to </v>

779
00:35:14.621 --> 00:35:18.390
<v Speaker 2>with my friend Mike Hockridge up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We came across a kill.</v>

780
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.780
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty fresh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

781
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:21.910
<v Speaker 2>a calf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a moose calf,</v>

782
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.030
<v Speaker 2>and it was just the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what were the stunning thing about it is</v>

783
00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:26.410
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty fresh.</v>

784
00:35:26.411 --> 00:35:27.244
<v Speaker 2>Like you look down at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it probably happened the night </v>

785
00:35:28.601 --> 00:35:31.360
<v Speaker 2>before maybe at the very earliest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a day ago.</v>

786
00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:35.200
<v Speaker 2>And it was fucking hair everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what I didn't expect somehow</v>

787
00:35:35.201 --> 00:35:36.670
<v Speaker 2>or another I thought like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

788
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect to see so much hair,</v>

789
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 2>but it's like almost like they shaved it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it stays for like a long time.</v>

790
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:43.824
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could come in the next summer and </v>

791
00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:49.230
<v Speaker 2>it'll be this big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked like a carpet well up there in BC</v>

792
00:35:49.231 --> 00:35:51.960
<v Speaker 2>where he lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can shoot as many walls as you want.</v>

793
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.823
<v Speaker 2>There's no quota.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason beings that there's so many </v>

794
00:35:54.541 --> 00:35:55.374
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to control the population and </v>

795
00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:57.840
<v Speaker 2>they're so fucking smart.</v>

796
00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.033
<v Speaker 2>They're really hard to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so these people that have cows up </v>

797
00:36:02.281 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 2>there and their various farm animals up </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

798
00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're constantly under </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressure,</v>

799
00:36:06.301 --> 00:36:07.680
<v Speaker 2>the constantly the threat of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>

800
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:09.023
<v Speaker 2>And as well as him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike shot a wolf that came at him and </v>

801
00:36:11.791 --> 00:36:12.624
<v Speaker 2>jumped at him off of a ridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was going up a ridge rifle in his </v>

802
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:20.450
<v Speaker 2>hand and he had made some howls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

803
00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can imitate a wolf's howl.</v>

804
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:27.290
<v Speaker 2>And the wolf saw him and literally was </v>
<v Speaker 2>jumping at him and he shot it in the air</v>

805
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.050
<v Speaker 2>that has asked me using whole Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>style.</v>

806
00:36:31.051 --> 00:36:31.884
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got this wolf mounted in his house </v>

807
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:37.140
<v Speaker 2>like this with his feet up to remind him</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that scene.</v>

808
00:36:37.141 --> 00:36:37.974
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that easily could have been the end of </v>

809
00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:38.990
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

810
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:40.920
<v Speaker 2>he's up there without a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without a gun.</v>

811
00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.450
<v Speaker 2>That wolf could kill the teamwork </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect.</v>

812
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

813
00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be horrific.</v>

814
00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:47.870
<v Speaker 2>They're worse.</v>

815
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.170
<v Speaker 1>So we called in a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

816
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:53.960
<v Speaker 1>we should go back to like the quota </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

817
00:36:53.961 --> 00:36:55.250
<v Speaker 1>because this is kind of a pet peeve of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

818
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.353
<v Speaker 1>People look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to encourage everybody at the </v>

819
00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:00.194
<v Speaker 1>office to go to our local fish and game </v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings and the town hall meetings and </v>

820
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:10.150
<v Speaker 1>things that happened there in Ketchum </v>
<v Speaker 1>Idaho and I'm the,</v>

821
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:14.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the arguments that came up was </v>
<v Speaker 1>just so backwards,</v>

822
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:18.690
<v Speaker 1>but it came from a place of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see the logical sequence here,</v>

823
00:37:18.691 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 1>but typically if there's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really long hunting season on something,</v>

824
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:28.440
<v Speaker 1>it means that hunters are doing a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad job of filling their tags.</v>

825
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:29.483
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

826
00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:30.683
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a really short season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it typically means that hunters are </v>

827
00:37:34.081 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 1>doing a really efficient job of filling </v>
<v Speaker 1>their tags.</v>

828
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:38.513
<v Speaker 1>So we have this very long season on </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves and several people from town </v>

829
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 1>stood up the fish and game meeting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

830
00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:50.340
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just immoral that,</v>

831
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:51.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were putting hunting pressure on </v>

832
00:37:52.741 --> 00:37:54.360
<v Speaker 1>wolves for eight months out of the year.</v>

833
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.990
<v Speaker 1>And the truth of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hunters,</v>

834
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.270
<v Speaker 1>myself included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are doing a very,</v>

835
00:38:02.271 --> 00:38:06.050
<v Speaker 1>very poor job of putting a tag on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

836
00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.183
<v Speaker 1>And I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've called him one in our area and it </v>

837
00:38:09.771 --> 00:38:13.550
<v Speaker 1>was an absolutely amazing experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

838
00:38:13.551 --> 00:38:14.384
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically are south facing slopes are </v>

839
00:38:15.801 --> 00:38:16.634
<v Speaker 1>wide open or north facing slopes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily timbered and I could hear the </v>

840
00:38:20.751 --> 00:38:23.510
<v Speaker 1>wolf calling below my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend of mine,</v>

841
00:38:23.511 --> 00:38:28.490
<v Speaker 1>Jim is an amazing shot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a old retired forest service dude.</v>

842
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:33.050
<v Speaker 1>And he got set up for the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm calling it the wolf.</v>

843
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:34.123
<v Speaker 1>As the wolf's coming up the mountain all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sudden starts making noises that I </v>

844
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:39.670
<v Speaker 1>just cannot make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kinda knew I was screwed.</v>

845
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.593
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was the vocal range is </v>

846
00:38:42.581 --> 00:38:43.414
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would look just like barks and woofs </v>

847
00:38:46.370 --> 00:38:49.780
<v Speaker 1>like Wolf's growls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it just sounded like this thing was</v>

848
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:53.020
<v Speaker 1>getting more and more pissed off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The closer it got to us.</v>

849
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.450
<v Speaker 1>And that was my job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

850
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.313
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to make this thing so pissed </v>

851
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:00.820
<v Speaker 1>that it just keeps coming and Jim's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get a shot at it.</v>

852
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:05.920
<v Speaker 1>And that thing broke the tree line </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 500 yards,</v>

853
00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:07.203
<v Speaker 1>made it at a dead sprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 60 yards from the timber all the </v>

854
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.390
<v Speaker 1>sudden hit the brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned around was gone.</v>

855
00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And that is the closest I've ever gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>to killing a wolf.</v>

856
00:39:16.951 --> 00:39:20.620
<v Speaker 1>And Idaho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sought for maybe a second.</v>

857
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.933
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

858
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.530
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening to this go,</v>

859
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:25.690
<v Speaker 2>why the fuck would you want to kill a </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf man?</v>

860
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.190
<v Speaker 2>You know what do you go to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little Duke.</v>

861
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.770
<v Speaker 2>Duke doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that law?</v>

862
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:31.140
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one always comes up is your</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick's small man.</v>

863
00:39:31.141 --> 00:39:34.960
<v Speaker 2>You want to kill a wolf?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I think is lost on people who don't</v>

864
00:39:34.961 --> 00:39:35.794
<v Speaker 2>encounter walls or who don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>the science behind wildlife management </v>

865
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:45.330
<v Speaker 2>is that there is nothing else that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to control their population.</v>

866
00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.773
<v Speaker 2>It's only going to be people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to survive through the </v>

867
00:39:49.211 --> 00:39:51.940
<v Speaker 2>winter and they're going to eat as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>elk as they can,</v>

868
00:39:51.941 --> 00:39:52.774
<v Speaker 2>as many deers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many whatever the fuck they can get </v>

869
00:39:53.831 --> 00:39:57.250
<v Speaker 2>ahold of as they can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially since they have this kind</v>

870
00:39:57.251 --> 00:40:01.330
<v Speaker 2>of crazy headstart before the animals </v>
<v Speaker 2>figured out that they were there because</v>

871
00:40:01.331 --> 00:40:02.164
<v Speaker 2>they'd never been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And over 100 years since they were </v>

872
00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:07.120
<v Speaker 2>extricated from the American southwest </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

873
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they had done was with wolves.</v>

874
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:12.570
<v Speaker 2>They had shot like horses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like wild horses.</v>

875
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Then injected them with strychnine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

876
00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 2>And then they had shot like an Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf and rubbed his scent and his glands</v>

877
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 2>all over the meat so that the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves knew that he had been there.</v>

878
00:40:23.591 --> 00:40:25.180
<v Speaker 2>So they thought it was okay to eat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

879
00:40:25.181 --> 00:40:26.014
<v Speaker 2>And so they would eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would get the strict nine and they </v>

880
00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:28.480
<v Speaker 2>would die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

881
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.070
<v Speaker 2>it was a mass kill off this wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

882
00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Judas Wolf.</v>

883
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

884
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

885
00:40:35.721 --> 00:40:37.760
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is management,</v>

886
00:40:37.761 --> 00:40:39.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is like,</v>

887
00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:42.570
<v Speaker 1>one of the hottest topics in our area </v>
<v Speaker 1>was um,</v>

888
00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.290
<v Speaker 1>in the winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a heavy winter right now,</v>

889
00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:48.920
<v Speaker 1>all your game animals get congregated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower elevations,</v>

890
00:40:48.921 --> 00:40:49.754
<v Speaker 1>typically on these south facing slopes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and get a lot of sun heavy winters like </v>

891
00:40:53.811 --> 00:40:54.644
<v Speaker 1>we're experiencing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These animals are basically pushed into </v>

892
00:40:57.831 --> 00:40:58.664
<v Speaker 1>that farm and ranch country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those operators down there are </v>

893
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.083
<v Speaker 1>feeding their winter livestock and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves and the coyotes are writing on </v>

894
00:41:12.321 --> 00:41:14.600
<v Speaker 1>top everybody in calving seasons right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

895
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.020
<v Speaker 1>So then you get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically a very large,</v>

896
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:20.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did rate.</v>

897
00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mortality rates by spikes because you </v>

898
00:41:23.071 --> 00:41:25.340
<v Speaker 1>got animals that are in distress and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

899
00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:26.413
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after birth from the birthing process </v>

900
00:41:27.861 --> 00:41:32.861
<v Speaker 1>everywhere you got easy pickins on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabs and a hunters aren't knocking these</v>

901
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:36.830
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the state and you know,</v>

902
00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:37.664
<v Speaker 1>like a cattleman's association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll go together and fun helicopter </v>

903
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.283
<v Speaker 1>gunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Ariel gunning to go out there and </v>

904
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:44.720
<v Speaker 1>shoot those animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

905
00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

906
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

907
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I would love to hear the tiny dick </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument.</v>

908
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

909
00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.620
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

910
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.670
<v Speaker 2>go a tiny dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want to kill a wolf there?</v>

911
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>magnificent creatures.</v>

912
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:58.503
<v Speaker 2>And they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's important to recognize that </v>

913
00:42:00.311 --> 00:42:03.400
<v Speaker 2>there have historically been gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems with wolves and people.</v>

914
00:42:03.401 --> 00:42:07.210
<v Speaker 2>That's where all the Little Red Riding </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hood Shit comes from the wolves in Paris</v>

915
00:42:07.211 --> 00:42:09.010
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're aware of that story from</v>

916
00:42:09.011 --> 00:42:11.980
<v Speaker 2>the 14 hundreds where they killed like </v>
<v Speaker 2>40 people in Paris.</v>

917
00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.550
<v Speaker 2>That Paris has wolves in it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know that?</v>

918
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:17.560
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

919
00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:19.180
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people are being told.</v>

920
00:42:19.181 --> 00:42:20.014
<v Speaker 2>There was an article about it recently </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people are being told to not fear </v>

921
00:42:22.301 --> 00:42:23.134
<v Speaker 2>the wolves that are in the streets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking Paris because they're only </v>

922
00:42:26.261 --> 00:42:29.740
<v Speaker 2>looking for four legged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pray like these fucking people.</v>

923
00:42:29.741 --> 00:42:32.320
<v Speaker 2>Don't remember this story from the 14 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds,</v>

924
00:42:32.321 --> 00:42:33.154
<v Speaker 2>this historical story where the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Paris had to gather together with </v>

925
00:42:36.461 --> 00:42:40.870
<v Speaker 2>fucking spears and quarter these wolves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and killed them in a town square.</v>

926
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:42.320
<v Speaker 2>It's an amazing story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

927
00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:43.390
<v Speaker 2>How much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

928
00:42:43.391 --> 00:42:45.420
<v Speaker 2>obviously when you're dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something from 1400,</v>

929
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:46.263
<v Speaker 2>there's no film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we don't know how much of this is </v>

930
00:42:48.491 --> 00:42:49.324
<v Speaker 2>accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a historical story that they </v>

931
00:42:51.611 --> 00:42:55.750
<v Speaker 2>had to kill a ton of wolves and I'm sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys know about the story from World</v>

932
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:56.583
<v Speaker 2>War One.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russians and the Germans had a </v>

933
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.660
<v Speaker 2>ceasefire because so many of them were </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting killed by wolves in Russia.</v>

934
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:03.810
<v Speaker 2>They decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go kill these fucking wolves.</v>

935
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.020
<v Speaker 2>Then we'll go back to killing each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

936
00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I had never heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never heard.</v>

937
00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a great story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great story.</v>

938
00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.653
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

939
00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.970
<v Speaker 6>I mean the populous at large,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what they,</v>

940
00:43:11.971 --> 00:43:12.804
<v Speaker 6>I think will benefit the most from it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's people on extreme lovers and </v>

941
00:43:16.831 --> 00:43:17.664
<v Speaker 6>extreme haters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but in the middle there is somewhere in </v>

942
00:43:20.251 --> 00:43:21.084
<v Speaker 6>the middle there's a right thing to do </v>
<v Speaker 6>and I think that the government </v>

943
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:24.683
<v Speaker 6>definitely puts their best foot forward,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the scientists and whatever to figure </v>

944
00:43:29.281 --> 00:43:31.230
<v Speaker 6>out that balance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

945
00:43:31.231 --> 00:43:33.840
<v Speaker 6>and I think that to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

946
00:43:33.841 --> 00:43:35.580
<v Speaker 6>we need to have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

947
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:36.563
<v Speaker 6>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 6>wolves in Idaho is naive because that </v>

948
00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:40.080
<v Speaker 6>would happen for,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for instance,</v>

949
00:43:40.081 --> 00:43:43.980
<v Speaker 6>if they were just let you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>for procreate at will.</v>

950
00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:48.390
<v Speaker 6>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these people are trying to be good,</v>

951
00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.550
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the,</v>

952
00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:50.483
<v Speaker 6>that's why they're calling them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why you know that that's why </v>

953
00:43:52.981 --> 00:43:54.600
<v Speaker 6>they're reintroduced him to create a </v>
<v Speaker 6>balance,</v>

954
00:43:54.601 --> 00:43:56.040
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that that's,</v>

955
00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.090
<v Speaker 6>that needs to be realized both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh sorry,</v>

956
00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.133
<v Speaker 2>both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that don't want any wolves to </v>

957
00:44:00.611 --> 00:44:01.444
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't want Wolf's die because </v>

958
00:44:02.231 --> 00:44:04.480
<v Speaker 2>wolves are amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then wildlife is amazing.</v>

959
00:44:04.481 --> 00:44:05.560
<v Speaker 2>It's totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

960
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:06.403
<v Speaker 2>you can go to yellowstone and I went to </v>
<v Speaker 2>summer and you'd go and see a herd of </v>

961
00:44:09.671 --> 00:44:11.640
<v Speaker 2>buffalo just chilling on this field,</v>

995
00:45:29.001 --> 00:45:31.850
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a movie rather than he did called Willow</v>

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

997
00:45:32.861 --> 00:45:33.694

<v Speaker 2>the movie was about all the different </v>

998
00:45:34.701 --> 00:45:35.534
<v Speaker 2>people that get lost in the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>his movie was saying that big foot was </v>

999
00:45:37.641 --> 00:45:38.710
<v Speaker 2>eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1000
00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.600
<v Speaker 2>Pretty ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there is it.</v>

1001
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.960
<v Speaker 2>Your is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was fun.</v>

1002
00:45:44.961 --> 00:45:46.450
<v Speaker 2>But bobcat is a nut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

1003
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:48.200
<v Speaker 2>he's a big foot fanatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1004
00:45:48.201 --> 00:45:50.900
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to tell them from people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that actually go to the woods,</v>

1005
00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many hunters see big foot zero,</v>

1006
00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.820
<v Speaker 2>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's zero.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing.</v>

1010
00:46:03.321 --> 00:46:04.154

<v Speaker 2>the number of trail cams that exist </v>

1011
00:46:05.391 --> 00:46:06.224
<v Speaker 2>today in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put people put up to scout to try to </v>

1012
00:46:08.931 --> 00:46:11.300
<v Speaker 2>find out where the animals are and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>on top of that,</v>

1013
00:46:11.301 --> 00:46:12.134
<v Speaker 2>the number of phones that people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have cameras on them has gone </v>

1014
00:46:14.001 --> 00:46:16.880
<v Speaker 2>through the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the bigfoot sightings have shrunk.</v>

1015
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:19.880
<v Speaker 2>There's way less of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So we're.</v>

1025
00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:49.533
<v Speaker 4>I mean the office is just under 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>feet and then within 20 minutes of the </v>

1026
00:46:54.881 --> 00:46:59.170
<v Speaker 4>office you can climb to 11,000</v>

1028
00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:02.710
<v Speaker 4>There is a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's difficult.</v>

1029
00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.840
<v Speaker 4>Bring one of these kettlebells up there </v>
<v Speaker 4>and get yourself a workout.</v>

1030
00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:07.570
<v Speaker 4>You feel good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you feel good,</v>

1031
00:47:07.571 --> 00:47:08.730
<v Speaker 4>and then you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1032
00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:09.573
<v Speaker 4>a couple days worth of stuff on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and your like your wife that you </v>

1033
00:47:13.361 --> 00:47:17.110
<v Speaker 4>have to drink so much water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When there's high altitude.</v>

1034
00:47:17.111 --> 00:47:18.880
<v Speaker 4>What's that about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just dry.</v>

1035
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:23.170
<v Speaker 4>Generally speaking are we are just low </v>
<v Speaker 4>humidity and deep breathe.</v>

1036
00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:24.033
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time you breathe out you breathe </v>

1037
00:47:25.781 --> 00:47:26.900
<v Speaker 4>out a little water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1038
00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.210
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the mist is.</v>

1039
00:47:28.211 --> 00:47:30.010
<v Speaker 4>When you see people at and it's cold</v>

1040
00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:31.570
<v Speaker 2>and stuff that's coming out of your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth,</v>

1041
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:35.170
<v Speaker 2>that's actually water vapor and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>exists all the time.</v>

1042
00:47:35.171 --> 00:47:38.800
<v Speaker 2>You just don't see it because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a big difference in the temperature,</v>

1043
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.980
<v Speaker 2>which means your body in the air like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is when it's really cold out.</v>

1044
00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.150
<v Speaker 2>I think that's why people are more hung </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the mountains.</v>

1045
00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Certainly my excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1046
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.690
<v Speaker 2>Well I got to be because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>dehydrated too.</v>

1047
00:47:49.691 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Which is the big factor in being hung </v>
<v Speaker 2>over in the first place.</v>

1048
00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1049
00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.153
<v Speaker 2>Like the people that are pros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll pound booze and they'll have a </v>

1050
00:47:56.531 --> 00:47:57.364
<v Speaker 2>fucking jug of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A buddy of mine drank with John Claude </v>

1051
00:48:00.190 --> 00:48:01.140
<v Speaker 2>van Damme and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1052
00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:05.080
<v Speaker 2>this is like way back when John Claude </v>
<v Speaker 2>van Damme was a big movie star doing all</v>

1053
00:48:05.081 --> 00:48:05.914
<v Speaker 2>these big movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he would do booze and he had a </v>

1054
00:48:08.381 --> 00:48:09.214
<v Speaker 2>fucking gallon of water with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He brought like a milk jug size gallon </v>

1055
00:48:13.811 --> 00:48:14.560
<v Speaker 2>filled with water.</v>

1056
00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.080
<v Speaker 2>So you do a shot and fucking chug the </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1057
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.440
<v Speaker 2>Like it was really consciously Busan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I've never seen anybody do before.</v>

1058
00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:27.820
<v Speaker 2>That's oozing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a guy that's going,</v>

1059
00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:30.163
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stop being a </v>

1060
00:48:30.461 --> 00:48:33.100
<v Speaker 2>degenerate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to take care of my body in the</v>

1061
00:48:33.101 --> 00:48:33.934
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He comes to catch into years two and </v>

1062
00:48:35.471 --> 00:48:38.330
<v Speaker 2>we'd hear stories about looseness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

1063
00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I've never witnessed it myself </v>
<v Speaker 2>looseness,</v>

1064
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into the bars and getting loose.</v>

1065
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:44.620
<v Speaker 2>Getting party in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1066
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.513
<v Speaker 2>It gets crazy and catch him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he used to throw side kicks </v>

1067
00:48:48.281 --> 00:48:49.120
<v Speaker 2>off the roof and shit.</v>

1068
00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1069
00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:53.950
<v Speaker 1>shots for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First time I ever heard a wolf,</v>

1070
00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.400
<v Speaker 1>and this goes back to like the hair on </v>
<v Speaker 1>your arms stand up.</v>

1071
00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:58.733
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working with a buddy of mine and </v>

1072
00:48:59.711 --> 00:49:00.544
<v Speaker 1>the Frank Church wilderness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is that just straight north to catch </v>

1073
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:04.264
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the largest contiguous wilderness </v>

1074
00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:07.860
<v Speaker 1>in the lower 48.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1075
00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's huge.</v>

1076
00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:10.730
<v Speaker 1>And it tried to get people to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1077
00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:14.950
<v Speaker 1>We tried to force people in there to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine and Pharma and it just didn't take.</v>

1078
00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:15.993
<v Speaker 1>So there's old homesteads and stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some eerie stuff like the </v>

1079
00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:19.540
<v Speaker 1>Missouri breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1080
00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

1081
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.950
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just kind of a grander scale.</v>

1082
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm much more timber and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your guys' first experience out there,</v>

1083
00:49:28.001 --> 00:49:30.490
<v Speaker 1>I think I still think about that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>

1084
00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:31.773
<v Speaker 1>I would love to put some of these like </v>
<v Speaker 1>land transfer people out there on that </v>

1085
00:49:35.231 --> 00:49:36.520
<v Speaker 1>same trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1086
00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:40.930
<v Speaker 1>These guys showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 34 degrees trying to snow.</v>

1087
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Mostly just rain overcast grace guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

1088
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:47.130
<v Speaker 1>Nothing Mary about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1089
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:49.140
<v Speaker 1>it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Worse temperature to deal with.</v>

1090
00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Well then it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it got</v>

1091
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.510
<v Speaker 2>done like nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1092
00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:53.280
<v Speaker 2>it was getting real cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1093
00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.320
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1094
00:49:55.321 --> 00:49:56.154
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the things about being in </v>

1095
00:49:59.221 --> 00:50:04.221
<v Speaker 2>the real wilderness is how like </v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful but lonely it is.</v>

1096
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.400
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of lonely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something weird about it.</v>

1097
00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Like you could die and it doesn't give a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>

1098
00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.370
<v Speaker 2>You have this illusion like if you died </v>
<v Speaker 2>right here,</v>

1099
00:50:14.371 --> 00:50:16.530
<v Speaker 2>if you had a heart attack and toe over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd all be bummed out.</v>

1100
00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.900
<v Speaker 2>Like God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lost Ryan Callahan.</v>

1101
00:50:18.901 --> 00:50:20.610
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe it man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1102
00:50:20.611 --> 00:50:23.940
<v Speaker 2>we'd be bummed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the woods wouldn't give a fuck.</v>

1103
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.470
<v Speaker 2>You would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd fall dead and everything go.</v>

1104
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.960
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the humble,</v>

1105
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:35.320
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of humility and the feeling </v>
<v Speaker 2>of insignificance is so overwhelming and</v>

1106
00:50:36.290 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 2>unavoidable that it's just this intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization of your piece.</v>

1107
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Like where you are as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you fit in in this grand,</v>

1108
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:49.990
<v Speaker 2>gigantic Mandalah of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like it's an</v>

1109
00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:52.160
<v Speaker 6>find the for the further.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You go back,</v>

1110
00:50:52.161 --> 00:50:52.994
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know your full day plus walk </v>

1111
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:56.331
<v Speaker 6>away,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1112
00:50:56.331 --> 00:50:59.600
<v Speaker 6>or you get dropped off somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1113
00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:01.130
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

1114
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.540
<v Speaker 6>we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1115
00:51:03.541 --> 00:51:04.220
<v Speaker 6>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's a.</v>

1116
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:05.930
<v Speaker 6>it's a cool feeling though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's the whole thing,</v>

1117
00:51:05.931 --> 00:51:07.070
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're outside of your comfort zone.</v>

1118
00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.810
<v Speaker 6>That's what makes it so pleasurable.</v>

1119
00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:13.090
<v Speaker 2>My friend Adam Green tree went on a do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it yourself hunt in Montana and archery,</v>

1120
00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:14.733
<v Speaker 2>elk hunt and he went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he went at least 12 miles in </v>

1121
00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:20.080
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might've went more by himself,</v>

1122
00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.570
<v Speaker 2>shot an elk big fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1123
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:25.810
<v Speaker 2>did out by himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four days,</v>

1124
00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:26.913
<v Speaker 2>four days a pack out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's got 100 pounds on his back and </v>

1125
00:51:30.671 --> 00:51:35.671
<v Speaker 2>he's got to walk 12 miles back and forth</v>
<v Speaker 2>for four days to get this elk out.</v>

1126
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.640
<v Speaker 1>That's heavy for folks who don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is four days of misery for days and</v>

1127
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.823
<v Speaker 1>looking around and</v>

1128
00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:47.020
<v Speaker 2>whistling through the woods and he's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>decent shape.</v>

1129
00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he works out a little bit,</v>

1130
00:51:48.251 --> 00:51:49.540
<v Speaker 2>but he's not campaigns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1131
00:51:49.541 --> 00:51:51.460
<v Speaker 2>he's not like some fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon,</v>

1132
00:51:51.461 --> 00:51:54.300
<v Speaker 2>ultra runner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not as job to be fit.</v>

1133
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:57.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a professional bowhunter hunter and</v>

1134
00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.960
<v Speaker 2>he's got a mining job in Australia and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1135
00:51:58.961 --> 00:52:00.310
<v Speaker 2>The other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lives in Australia,</v>

1136
00:52:00.311 --> 00:52:01.990
<v Speaker 2>so even though he brought all that meat </v>
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>

1137
00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:02.883
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't even take it home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could only eat what he had here in </v>

1138
00:52:05.651 --> 00:52:07.390
<v Speaker 2>America and then donate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1139
00:52:07.391 --> 00:52:09.610
<v Speaker 2>you can't bring it back to Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't allow that shame.</v>

1140
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Australian Customs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't allow you to meet your trips.</v>

1141
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:14.343
<v Speaker 1>So let's say it did a little bit of meat</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his entire camp out on the first </v>

1142
00:52:18.881 --> 00:52:21.340
<v Speaker 1>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's three loads of just meat.</v>

1143
00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Eighty pounds load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1144
00:52:23.251 --> 00:52:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean that guy brought out a lot.</v>

1145
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:28.570
<v Speaker 2>He brought it all back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You brought it all back over four days.</v>

1146
00:52:28.571 --> 00:52:29.404
<v Speaker 2>But they described it like how brutal </v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience was by himself shooting </v>

1147
00:52:35.471 --> 00:52:36.910
<v Speaker 2>this animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he called a buddy,</v>

1148
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:38.170
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to uh,</v>

1149
00:52:38.171 --> 00:52:39.004
<v Speaker 2>to help him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy helped him pack out a </v>

1150
00:52:40.061 --> 00:52:40.894
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>

1151
00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Imagine your bones laying there on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prairie in eastern Montana.</v>

1152
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.130
<v Speaker 1>There's a good chance because hunters do</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing,</v>

1153
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:51.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Game Kinda does the same thing.</v>

1154
00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Generation after generation generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about you tip over dead.</v>

1155
00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a very good chance in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1156
00:52:58.761 --> 00:53:03.761
<v Speaker 1>There's probably like a cro or sue set </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bones underneath you.</v>

1157
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:05.863
<v Speaker 1>Maybe somebody's horse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bison antic was all stacked up </v>

1158
00:53:10.971 --> 00:53:12.270
<v Speaker 1>underneath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1159
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 1>it does not give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't give as well.</v>

1160
00:53:14.931 --> 00:53:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Any of bones out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just joined in the pile</v>

1161
00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:20.650
<v Speaker 2>and there's a whole system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of waste is ludicrous.</v>

1162
00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.230
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if anything the dies,</v>

1163
00:53:23.231 --> 00:53:24.064
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to waste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not going to waste your dog </v>

1164
00:53:26.581 --> 00:53:27.414
<v Speaker 2>dies out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to waste something will </v>

1165
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 2>eat it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is.</v>

1166
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:32.160
<v Speaker 2>That is the whole system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is A.</v>

1167
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:34.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it doesn't seem like it to you as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a person.</v>

1168
00:53:34.981 --> 00:53:36.600
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not supposed to eat fluffy.</v>

1169
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.730
<v Speaker 2>He's my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1170
00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.300
<v Speaker 2>that's a dog and the dog is an animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>and an animal that dies.</v>

1171
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.850
<v Speaker 2>There is a whole system in place for </v>
<v Speaker 2>handling that for sure.</v>

1172
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:46.703
<v Speaker 2>I mean from the wolf and the Fox is </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll come in and the birds and then </v>

1173
00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:54.060
<v Speaker 2>in the bacteria bugs everything and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be gone.</v>

1174
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.910
<v Speaker 2>It'll be down to bones and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually something will eat the bones.</v>

1175
00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:00.640
<v Speaker 4>Did you take the picture of the artery </v>
<v Speaker 4>bulb?</v>

1176
00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.533
<v Speaker 4>I posted this year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>had just left the face on and then took </v>

1177
00:54:04.301 --> 00:54:05.000
<v Speaker 4>all the meat off.</v>

1178
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:05.833
<v Speaker 2>You did an amazing job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so important to post too because </v>

1179
00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:13.160
<v Speaker 2>you didn't waste an ounce of that meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cut every in between the ribs,</v>

1180
00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were.</v>

1181
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people were commenting on that photo</v>

1182
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:19.820
<v Speaker 2>like that is the respect that you give </v>
<v Speaker 2>an animal when you hunt it and you shoot</v>

1183
00:54:19.821 --> 00:54:20.790
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the right way to end.</v>

1184
00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:23.320
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the reality and I think so too.</v>

1185
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to go above and beyond.</v>

1186
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an organ meat guy too.</v>

1187
00:54:30.311 --> 00:54:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I love heart and liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a need.</v>

1188
00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to start with tongues this </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

1189
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:37.240
<v Speaker 4>I was thinking about your liver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude.</v>

1190
00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.133
<v Speaker 4>I had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the worst thing to be vocal </v>

1191
00:54:40.331 --> 00:54:42.220
<v Speaker 4>about ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to.</v>

1192
00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.440
<v Speaker 4>I used to get called up all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1193
00:54:44.441 --> 00:54:45.274
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a tongue for you because I know </v>

1194
00:54:45.941 --> 00:54:49.310
<v Speaker 4>you like him right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just overwhelmed with tongues.</v>

1195
00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:54.540
<v Speaker 4>Everybody keeps their time and they keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>their tongue out of the bag.</v>

1196
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:57.130
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you will love it.</v>

1197
00:54:57.250 --> 00:54:58.940
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1198
00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.300
<v Speaker 4>the thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1199
00:55:01.301 --> 00:55:02.134
<v Speaker 4>you should take every single thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there are little things to get </v>

1200
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:06.003
<v Speaker 4>wasted and like the rib meat chunks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially later in the season when </v>

1201
00:55:09.221 --> 00:55:10.810
<v Speaker 4>there's not a lot of fat on these </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals,</v>

1202
00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.033
<v Speaker 4>like if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's going to take you some time to </v>

1203
00:55:13.061 --> 00:55:13.894
<v Speaker 4>get out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the stuff that's going to get </v>

1204
00:55:15.220 --> 00:55:20.220
<v Speaker 4>super dry it out right before you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>even make something out of it.</v>

1205
00:55:20.501 --> 00:55:21.370
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1206
00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:24.010
<v Speaker 4>you were saying about liver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1207
00:55:24.011 --> 00:55:27.340
<v Speaker 4>So you made a comment that you eat a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of liver.</v>

1208
00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:28.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like is that,</v>

1209
00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:30.780
<v Speaker 4>is that a typical la dish?</v>

1210
00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1211
00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:33.070
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1212
00:55:33.071 --> 00:55:35.830
<v Speaker 2>it's me just organ meats really good for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1213
00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:39.310
<v Speaker 2>It was so high in vitamins and iron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>

1214
00:55:39.311 --> 00:55:41.770
<v Speaker 2>And it's just something about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just feels good when I'm eating it,</v>

1215
00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:42.873
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's all I had read about wolves that </v>

1216
00:55:44.191 --> 00:55:46.240
<v Speaker 2>wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's one of the ways that they,</v>

1217
00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:48.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they established the alpha.</v>

1218
00:55:48.911 --> 00:55:50.860
<v Speaker 2>The alpha is the one that eats the </v>
<v Speaker 2>deliver.</v>

1219
00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.600
<v Speaker 2>When he killed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they kill an animal,</v>

1220
00:55:52.601 --> 00:55:54.940
<v Speaker 2>the Alpha immediately leads to liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1221
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:56.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was this guy that was living with </v>

1222
00:55:56.951 --> 00:56:01.951
<v Speaker 2>wolves and he had these wolves sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>convinced that he was a wolf and a,</v>

1223
00:56:01.961 --> 00:56:02.794
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a wildlife biologist and a both </v>

1224
00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:06.610
<v Speaker 2>expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I forget where this was,</v>

1225
00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:08.320
<v Speaker 2>that he was doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a whole documentary on it.</v>

1226
00:56:08.321 --> 00:56:09.154
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that they never </v>

1227
00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.100
<v Speaker 2>cry wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember the name of it,</v>

1228
00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:12.700
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately.</v>

1229
00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:13.533
<v Speaker 2>Maybe Jamie can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that this guy did </v>

1230
00:56:15.431 --> 00:56:19.690
<v Speaker 2>was he would put a liver in a downed </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal,</v>

1231
00:56:19.691 --> 00:56:21.490
<v Speaker 2>like they would kill an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>place it put,</v>

1232
00:56:21.491 --> 00:56:24.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liver in it and would eat the liver in</v>

1233
00:56:24.641 --> 00:56:27.250
<v Speaker 2>front of the other wolves so that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be the dominant male.</v>

1234
00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.460
<v Speaker 2>And where he got fucked up is he had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave because it's a wolf expert.</v>

1235
00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.570
<v Speaker 2>There was a farmer that was being </v>
<v Speaker 2>inundated by wolves.</v>

1236
00:56:34.571 --> 00:56:35.404
<v Speaker 2>So they had set up this whole way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep the wolves away from this guy's </v>

1237
00:56:38.921 --> 00:56:39.754
<v Speaker 2>property without killing them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that they did was </v>

1238
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:42.454
<v Speaker 2>they set up all these speakers and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>projected the sounds of these alpha </v>

1239
00:56:45.641 --> 00:56:47.950
<v Speaker 2>wolves with these giant speakers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

1240
00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:48.701
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

1241
00:56:48.701 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 2>there's a new fucking king just moved </v>
<v Speaker 2>into town.</v>

1242
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.420
<v Speaker 2>Everybody get the hell away from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep.</v>

1243
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:55.690
<v Speaker 2>And they set up these big ass speakers </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over and it worked.</v>

1244
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:59.980
<v Speaker 2>But it took a long time to keep these </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolves away like a couple of months.</v>

1245
00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:05.280
<v Speaker 2>And so when he came back then there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a new alpha that had taken his place and</v>

1246
00:57:05.291 --> 00:57:09.280
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a horrific scene where this guy</v>

1247
00:57:09.281 --> 00:57:12.970
<v Speaker 2>is standing there whimpering in front of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wolf and this huge wolf is in front</v>

1248
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:15.880
<v Speaker 2>of him bearing his teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just thinking at any minute,</v>

1249
00:57:15.881 --> 00:57:18.220
<v Speaker 2>this wolf is just going to tear this </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy's fucking face off.</v>

1250
00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.280
<v Speaker 2>This real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1251
00:57:19.281 --> 00:57:20.470
<v Speaker 2>It's 100 percent real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1252
00:57:20.471 --> 00:57:22.360
<v Speaker 2>it's 100 percent real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gnarly.</v>

1253
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:26.050
<v Speaker 2>When the wolfs in front of me and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1254
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:32.080
<v Speaker 2>and he's got to hope that this wolf does</v>
<v Speaker 2>not decide to attack him.</v>

1255
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.530
<v Speaker 2>That shows him mercy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:36.070
<v Speaker 2>He established a friendship with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>wolf and he was the Alpha,</v>

1257
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:39.970
<v Speaker 2>the point where it's going to accept the</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing of positions and he has to show</v>

1258
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:42.220
<v Speaker 2>no resistance to this change.</v>

1259
00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:45.580
<v Speaker 2>So it's a really critical moment in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking life man,</v>

1260
00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.480
<v Speaker 2>because it might end right there with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that wolf in a bad way.</v>

1261
00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:51.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1262
00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:53.170
<v Speaker 2>everything's happy when there's food </v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

1263
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:57.460
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if late in the season and food scarce,</v>

1264
00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.490
<v Speaker 2>that would be a tough proposition of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1265
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:01.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Early in the season when everybody's </v>

1266
00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:04.540
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's calves on the ground.</v>

1267
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Easy pickins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1268
00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:10.450
<v Speaker 2>I was reading this article about bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this one region of Alaska,</v>

1269
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.313
<v Speaker 2>whereas this salmon run and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a video of it where there's a </v>

1270
00:58:15.461 --> 00:58:16.294
<v Speaker 2>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've seen the video because </v>

1271
00:58:17.231 --> 00:58:19.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a famous video where this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting there,</v>

1272
00:58:19.301 --> 00:58:22.360
<v Speaker 2>he's got a little lawn chair and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking photographs of the bears and this</v>

1273
00:58:22.361 --> 00:58:27.361
<v Speaker 2>fucking Volkswagen bus with hair walks </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to him and just hangs out and there's</v>

1274
00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:31.970
<v Speaker 2>no danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no fear because it's bear.</v>

1275
00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:34.300
<v Speaker 2>It's fat and there's a salmon </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

1276
00:58:34.301 --> 00:58:36.080
<v Speaker 2>And as the guy pans away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

1277
00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:36.821
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

1278
00:58:36.821 --> 00:58:38.110
<v Speaker 2>get out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear and the bear,</v>

1279
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 2>the bear leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's fucking 1500 pound bear.</v>

1280
00:58:42.551 --> 00:58:43.384
<v Speaker 2>It's an enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People even get how big they are until </v>

1281
00:58:46.711 --> 00:58:48.770
<v Speaker 2>you're right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably can't know.</v>

1282
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:49.683
<v Speaker 2>But as this guy pans away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that there's just like a dozen </v>

1283
00:58:52.330 --> 00:58:56.690
<v Speaker 2>bears and this one area and they're so </v>
<v Speaker 2>well fed this store,</v>

1284
00:58:56.730 --> 00:59:01.730
<v Speaker 2>this area historically has an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 2>low incident or low rate of attack.</v>

1285
00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:06.850
<v Speaker 2>There's like almost no attacks by bears </v>
<v Speaker 2>on people in this one area.</v>

1286
00:59:06.970 --> 00:59:09.730
<v Speaker 2>This is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Food is food is the deal.</v>

1287
00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Look at that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1288
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:14.710
<v Speaker 2>You can sit in this one too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is,</v>

1289
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.320
<v Speaker 2>that's a tanker.</v>

1292
00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I told them to contact you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did he contact?</v>

1293
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1295
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:29.890
<v Speaker 2>behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This TV sucks.</v>

1296
00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.340
<v Speaker 2>He's cutting out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>This guy has to chase his bear off.</v>

1298
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:35.540
<v Speaker 2>But now look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the bear goes over,</v>

1299
00:59:35.541 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 2>whatever it means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got a big fat belly and you turn and you</v>

<v Speaker 2>overrun.</v>

1301
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Look behind you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look behind you.</v>

1302
00:59:42.531 --> 00:59:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1303
00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Be such a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look behind you.</v>

1304
00:59:45.951 --> 00:59:48.140
<v Speaker 2>Look at all those little bears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1305
00:59:48.141 --> 00:59:49.760
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1306
00:59:49.761 --> 00:59:50.331
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

1307
00:59:50.331 --> 00:59:51.170
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

1308
00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:51.981
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven,</v>

1309
00:59:51.981 --> 00:59:52.611
<v Speaker 2>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

1310
00:59:52.611 --> 00:59:53.091
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>11,</v>

1311
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:53.661
<v Speaker 2>12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>

1312
00:59:53.661 --> 00:59:54.494
<v Speaker 2>14,</v>
<v Speaker 2>14 bears in just this limited </v>

1313
00:59:56.991 --> 00:59:57.824
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this guy's taken photos of them </v>

1314
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:00.980
<v Speaker 2>because it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's more,</v>

1315
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:04.100
<v Speaker 2>there's just overrun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just overrun with fish.</v>

1316
01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.120
<v Speaker 4>We were fishing up in Prince Wales up </v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve's fish shack.</v>

1317
01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:08.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1318
01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:09.400
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

1319
01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had his little boy in the canoe,</v>

1320
01:00:12.020 --> 01:00:14.270
<v Speaker 4>so there's three of us in the canoe and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we had,</v>

1321
01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:15.433
<v Speaker 4>it was high tide and we paddled away up </v>
<v Speaker 4>this creek and there were six black </v>

1322
01:00:18.561 --> 01:00:19.394
<v Speaker 4>bears in this creek that's as wide as </v>
<v Speaker 4>this room and we're just sitting in the </v>

1323
01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:27.580
<v Speaker 4>canoe and we kind of pushed the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bow of the canoe on the stick.</v>

1324
01:00:27.581 --> 01:00:30.950
<v Speaker 4>So it hold us in place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Steve's kid,</v>

1325
01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:31.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a kid,</v>

1326
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:35.510
<v Speaker 4>he's like bears or bad bears are scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1327
01:00:35.511 --> 01:00:36.344
<v Speaker 4>what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you could watch these bears take </v>

1328
01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:44.021
<v Speaker 4>turns and there was one lane in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>creek and as the salmon would,</v>

1329
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:47.360
<v Speaker 4>the water's dropping right at the tide's</v>
<v Speaker 4>going out.</v>

1330
01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.950
<v Speaker 4>So the salmon would come up the bear </v>
<v Speaker 4>weight for one to be easy,</v>

1331
01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:54.050
<v Speaker 4>grab it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk into the woods.</v>

1332
01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:56.930
<v Speaker 4>The next barrier would come down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lay in the same spot,</v>

1333
01:00:57.740 --> 01:00:59.330
<v Speaker 4>and just wait.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like a line.</v>

1334
01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:03.890
<v Speaker 4>There was a food line and everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally cool with each other.</v>

1335
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.320
<v Speaker 2>We're all going to get some plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

1336
01:01:07.321 --> 01:01:08.430
<v Speaker 2>No conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1337
01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>isn't that the same with people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1338
01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like kind of universal amongst all </v>
<v Speaker 2>species as resources get scarce.</v>

1339
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Shit gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1340
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is one of the things that's sort of</v>

1341
01:01:21.601 --> 01:01:22.434
<v Speaker 2>important to bring up when people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about wolves and predators and </v>

1342
01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:27.133
<v Speaker 2>populations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't ensure that these things </v>

1343
01:01:29.491 --> 01:01:31.470
<v Speaker 2>are going to have an adequate food </v>
<v Speaker 2>supply,</v>

1344
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.630
<v Speaker 2>especially as their numbers grow higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>and higher.</v>

1345
01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.573
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really controversial subject in </v>

1346
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.823
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the one thing that people don't </v>

1347
01:01:40.351 --> 01:01:41.184
<v Speaker 2>understand from the outside that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't understand the whole idea of </v>

1348
01:01:45.811 --> 01:01:47.890
<v Speaker 2>hunting predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1349
01:01:48.780 --> 01:01:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I feel like really kind of have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

1350
01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:52.103
<v Speaker 2>I feel like you kinda have to like </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost be just really involved in that </v>

1351
01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.113
<v Speaker 2>whole ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just be there physically to kind of get </v>

1352
01:01:59.941 --> 01:02:00.774
<v Speaker 2>it to you.</v>

1353
01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:01.773
<v Speaker 6>I think that's probably accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it would be almost odd to be </v>

1354
01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:06.880
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to go shoot some animal.</v>

1355
01:02:06.881 --> 01:02:08.860
<v Speaker 6>You've never seen no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nothing.</v>

1356
01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:10.630
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would be,</v>

1357
01:02:10.690 --> 01:02:12.820
<v Speaker 6>there's a certain cruelty to that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but maybe,</v>

1358
01:02:12.821 --> 01:02:13.631
<v Speaker 6>maybe not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

1359
01:02:13.631 --> 01:02:16.360
<v Speaker 6>But once you're,</v>
<v Speaker 6>once you've seen the cycle,</v>

1360
01:02:16.361 --> 01:02:18.550
<v Speaker 6>like in person,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it kind of,</v>

1361
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:19.663
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it brings everything together if you </v>

1362
01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:21.690
<v Speaker 6>will.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You see like,</v>

1363
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:22.321
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wow,</v>

1364
01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:26.010
<v Speaker 6>that's interesting that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're um,</v>

1365
01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:27.083
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that they're around now and I hopefully </v>

1366
01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 6>don't get too many of them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>

1367
01:02:30.331 --> 01:02:32.080
<v Speaker 6>maybe it's a good thing and maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1368
01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 6>certainly in our unit things are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Elk are fine.</v>

1369
01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance is so super important,</v>

1370
01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:39.433
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reason why places </v>
<v Speaker 2>like New Zealand or so odd because they </v>

1371
01:02:42.741 --> 01:02:43.574
<v Speaker 2>brought over imprint incredibly odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They brought over all these animals and </v>

1372
01:02:47.211 --> 01:02:48.044
<v Speaker 2>the what is like the 18 hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Europeans brought them over England </v>

1373
01:02:50.481 --> 01:02:51.314
<v Speaker 2>and brought them over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it was even earlier than </v>

1374
01:02:52.761 --> 01:02:53.320
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>

1375
01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.460
<v Speaker 6>Earlier in that all the way to say thank</v>
<v Speaker 6>God.</v>

1376
01:02:57.461 --> 01:03:02.461
<v Speaker 6>I think Roosevelt gave him a Canada </v>
<v Speaker 6>geese and the Mallard duck and like 19.</v>

1377
01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.560
<v Speaker 6>Oh five or something like that.</v>

1378
01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:06.443
<v Speaker 2>So what they did was they brought all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these animals over there with no </v>

1379
01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:10.014
<v Speaker 2>predators at all and so they have wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>stags and these red deer and all these </v>

1380
01:03:15.811 --> 01:03:16.644
<v Speaker 2>different animals that are not native </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're overrun to the point where </v>

1381
01:03:20.191 --> 01:03:22.950
<v Speaker 2>they have to do helicopter runs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfucking stag.</v>

1382
01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>They have to fly over and</v>

1383
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:30.740
<v Speaker 6>poison poison a whole valley because the</v>
<v Speaker 6>possums or whatever go crazy,</v>

1384
01:03:30.741 --> 01:03:32.840
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And there's nothing left to control it.</v>

1385
01:03:32.841 --> 01:03:33.674
<v Speaker 6>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you gotta think the thinking was no </v>

1386
01:03:34.791 --> 01:03:36.260
<v Speaker 6>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is going to be great.</v>

1387
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:38.210
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's gonna get along and it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>going to be.</v>

1388
01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.710
<v Speaker 6>And we'll have food.</v>

1389
01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Well the idea was that New Zealand was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be an exotic hunting ground for</v>

1390
01:03:44.681 --> 01:03:45.514
<v Speaker 2>the wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was going to be like a Texas ranch </v>

1391
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.250
<v Speaker 2>for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1392
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.733
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to come over and they </v>

1393
01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:52.294
<v Speaker 2>were going to jolly good time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go hunt a stag and they </v>

1394
01:03:56.021 --> 01:03:59.740
<v Speaker 2>would go over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they put these animals there,</v>

1395
01:03:59.741 --> 01:04:00.574
<v Speaker 2>but then they just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing killing them other than </v>

1396
01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:05.440
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they're just fucking like crazy.</v>

1397
01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.800
<v Speaker 2>And making baby stags and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whew.</v>

1398
01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:09.610
<v Speaker 2>This is a parties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plenty of food.</v>

1399
01:04:09.611 --> 01:04:12.370
<v Speaker 2>It's all lush and green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It rains like crazy.</v>

1400
01:04:12.371 --> 01:04:14.050
<v Speaker 2>So there's plenty of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beautiful.</v>

1401
01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:15.633
<v Speaker 2>Stunning.</v>

1402
01:04:15.730 --> 01:04:17.380
<v Speaker 6>Kenton has been over there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have not made it.</v>

1403
01:04:17.381 --> 01:04:18.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Did you hunt over there?</v>

1404
01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.280
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was cool.</v>

1405
01:04:21.281 --> 01:04:25.120
<v Speaker 6>We just kind of went over there and met </v>
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>

1406
01:04:25.121 --> 01:04:25.900
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>

1407
01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:29.350
<v Speaker 6>some of our wool growers and they rented</v>
<v Speaker 6>a helicopter and they kind of dropped us</v>

1408
01:04:29.351 --> 01:04:32.300
<v Speaker 6>off in the middle of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so.</v>

1409
01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.820
<v Speaker 6>So we'll see in a couple days.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1410
01:04:33.821 --> 01:04:34.654
<v Speaker 6>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They could drop stuff on top of this </v>

1411
01:04:35.681 --> 01:04:36.101
<v Speaker 6>hill.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We,</v>

1412
01:04:36.101 --> 01:04:37.990
<v Speaker 6>I was ready to get out of the bird,</v>
<v Speaker 6>frankly,</v>

1413
01:04:37.991 --> 01:04:38.824
<v Speaker 6>it was like crushing snow and I mean </v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been in helicopters a solid amount </v>

1414
01:04:43.751 --> 01:04:46.540
<v Speaker 6>and I don't love them and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll walk back,</v>

1415
01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:47.890
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's get down.</v>

1416
01:04:47.891 --> 01:04:51.040
<v Speaker 6>So we got down and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and just made our way out.</v>

1417
01:04:51.041 --> 01:04:56.041
<v Speaker 6>Ended up shooting a really nice shammy </v>
<v Speaker 6>was really wild looking animals wild.</v>

1418
01:04:56.441 --> 01:04:57.274
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean we didn't even know like how big </v>

1419
01:04:58.571 --> 01:05:00.310
<v Speaker 6>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're just out there and we're like,</v>

1420
01:05:00.311 --> 01:05:03.370
<v Speaker 6>how does the Shammy shot?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those are native to that area,</v>

1421
01:05:03.371 --> 01:05:04.180
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1422
01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.530
<v Speaker 6>we took it apart and pet,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1423
01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.513
<v Speaker 6>put all the meat and everything and </v>
<v Speaker 6>started walking out and almost left the </v>

1424
01:05:08.981 --> 01:05:10.480
<v Speaker 6>head there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then like,</v>

1425
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:11.470
<v Speaker 6>let's bring the head,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1426
01:05:11.471 --> 01:05:12.880
<v Speaker 6>it turns out some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1427
01:05:13.150 --> 01:05:16.420
<v Speaker 6>it was like a sci goal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would never seen one before.</v>

1428
01:05:16.421 --> 01:05:17.470
<v Speaker 6>They're all so small,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1429
01:05:17.471 --> 01:05:18.430
<v Speaker 6>they taste phenomenal.</v>

1430
01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:19.263
<v Speaker 4>So that night we got sci.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gold is always trying to say like the </v>

1431
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:24.360
<v Speaker 4>size of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a trophy size down.</v>

1432
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:25.930
<v Speaker 4>That's what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was,</v>

1433
01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:28.720
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was just how they fund </v>
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff.</v>

1434
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:33.490
<v Speaker 4>They do it in gold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have like silver inches,</v>

1435
01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.650
<v Speaker 4>but then it puts you into a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>category.</v>

1436
01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:40.651
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a 400 inch elk or a 200 </v>
<v Speaker 4>inch white tail.</v>

1437
01:05:40.751 --> 01:05:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Like there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1438
01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:42.890
<v Speaker 4>Just No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1439
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:45.400
<v Speaker 4>like a number that very few people ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>achieve.</v>

1440
01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.293
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1441
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.250
<v Speaker 4>But it was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1442
01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:51.100
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a huge number.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course I like to pay attention,</v>

1443
01:05:51.101 --> 01:05:52.380
<v Speaker 4>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>

1444
01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.060
<v Speaker 4>it's super yummy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shammies like super good.</v>

1445
01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:57.870
<v Speaker 4>What does it taste like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just kind of tastes like,</v>

1446
01:05:58.170 --> 01:05:59.350
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like lamb.</v>

1447
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:03.940
<v Speaker 4>I would say a cross between like a lamb </v>
<v Speaker 4>under the good white tail.</v>

1448
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:06.280
<v Speaker 4>Look at that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a weird animal,</v>

1449
01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.560
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1450
01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:11.830
<v Speaker 4>And they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I see a big fat guy with a dead</v>

1451
01:06:11.831 --> 01:06:12.664
<v Speaker 4>animal with a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like there's something wrong </v>

1452
01:06:15.191 --> 01:06:16.024
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1453
01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.760
<v Speaker 4>How does that guy get up there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1454
01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.850
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1455
01:06:21.851 --> 01:06:24.790
<v Speaker 4>this is totally ignorant on my part and </v>
<v Speaker 4>very biased,</v>

1456
01:06:24.791 --> 01:06:25.624
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like you should have to be in</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape to kill something that lives up </v>

1457
01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:28.774
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I see a fat guy that figures out a </v>

1458
01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:31.840
<v Speaker 4>way how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

1459
01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:33.160
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a short rope.</v>

1460
01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.000
<v Speaker 4>Damn short.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roped with.</v>

1461
01:06:36.001 --> 01:06:36.834
<v Speaker 4>Sent me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when guys climb everest that are </v>

1462
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:41.710
<v Speaker 4>not fit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll have a guide that just basically</v>

1463
01:06:41.711 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 4>short puts a short rope on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically.</v>

1464
01:06:44.681 --> 01:06:45.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1465
01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.840
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1466
01:06:46.841 --> 01:06:48.490
<v Speaker 4>Aggressive guiding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is it?</v>

1467
01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:49.443
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck is wrong with someone that</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't get fit and want to climb </v>

1468
01:06:51.971 --> 01:06:55.390
<v Speaker 4>everest?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just think that they have no idea what</v>

1469
01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:56.860
<v Speaker 4>it's like to be above 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>meters.</v>

1470
01:06:56.861 --> 01:07:01.690
<v Speaker 4>Like they might sit there and go on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>treadmill every single day and I don't.</v>

1471
01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:02.643
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1472
01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.250
<v Speaker 2>Meters is what's really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>because 8,000</v>

1473
01:07:05.251 --> 01:07:07.440
<v Speaker 2>feet sucks at east.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lived,</v>

1474
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:09.570
<v Speaker 2>when I lived in Boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were at 8,500</v>

1475
01:07:09.571 --> 01:07:12.750
<v Speaker 2>feet and I would do my kettlebell </v>
<v Speaker 2>routine at 8,500</v>

1476
01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:13.584
<v Speaker 2>feet and it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was like trying to like run through </v>

1477
01:07:16.531 --> 01:07:17.970
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1478
01:07:17.971 --> 01:07:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is hard to do.</v>

1479
01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:20.963
<v Speaker 2>It was incredibly hard to do so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more difficult than it is to do at sea </v>

1480
01:07:23.221 --> 01:07:26.250
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine went 8,000</v>

1481
01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.250
<v Speaker 2>meters is like</v>

1482
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.820
<v Speaker 4>narrow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like three percent.</v>

1483
01:07:28.821 --> 01:07:31.550
<v Speaker 4>I think you lose something like three </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent efficiency every thousand feet.</v>

1484
01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:37.580
<v Speaker 4>You come down to sea level and feet </v>
<v Speaker 4>every thousand thousand meters,</v>

1485
01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:39.650
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about 24,000,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25,</v>

1486
01:07:39.651 --> 01:07:41.690
<v Speaker 4>26,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>feet and it's insane.</v>

1487
01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:43.070
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's insane.</v>

1488
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.990
<v Speaker 4>Then you come down to sea level and for </v>
<v Speaker 4>me I'm like,</v>

1489
01:07:44.991 --> 01:07:46.070
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>running's pointless.</v>

1490
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:49.540
<v Speaker 4>This is been running for a while now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1491
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one thing that I noticed when I</v>

1492
01:07:52.441 --> 01:07:54.870
<v Speaker 2>did live up there for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was only like for four months,</v>

1493
01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:55.704
<v Speaker 2>but when I'd go down to sea level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt like I could fucking run through </v>

1494
01:07:58.231 --> 01:07:59.340
<v Speaker 2>walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1495
01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:03.420
<v Speaker 2>I can now I get why those guys like </v>
<v Speaker 2>train at elevation and then go and fight</v>

1496
01:08:03.421 --> 01:08:05.340
<v Speaker 2>at sea level because that's a big thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with fighters.</v>

1497
01:08:05.400 --> 01:08:08.280
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them were trained in Denver or </v>
<v Speaker 2>up here that go to big bear.</v>

1498
01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes away fast though.</v>

1499
01:08:10.171 --> 01:08:14.890
<v Speaker 4>It literally like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you acclimate here probably back.</v>

1500
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:16.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like not</v>

1501
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.960
<v Speaker 2>five days in your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1502
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:19.940
<v Speaker 2>it takes the same when you go back up </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

1503
01:08:19.941 --> 01:08:21.730
<v Speaker 2>if you've been at sea level for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go back up.</v>

1504
01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:24.140
<v Speaker 2>It takes awhile before you're kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1505
01:08:24.141 --> 01:08:25.070
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1506
01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I think they say that the best way to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is actually to train at low altitude,</v>

1507
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.213
<v Speaker 2>but to live at high altitude so </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] you could put in more work </v>

1508
01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.980
<v Speaker 2>so like you go down for the training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like say if you were next to big bear,</v>

1509
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:43.730
<v Speaker 2>you would drive down and then train it </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

1510
01:08:43.731 --> 01:08:44.564
<v Speaker 2>wherever down there and then bust your </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass and San Bernardino or whatever and </v>

1511
01:08:48.471 --> 01:08:49.304
<v Speaker 2>then go back up the hill and sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat and do all your stuff at high </v>

1512
01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:54.344
<v Speaker 2>altitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where your high workload is like for </v>

1513
01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:56.924
<v Speaker 2>the maximum efficiency of your training </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you could get a 100 reps in it </v>

1514
01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:01.000
<v Speaker 2>will elevate.</v>

1515
01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get more work in.</v>

1516
01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:03.613
<v Speaker 2>You can do more work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can and you can do it also for </v>

1517
01:09:05.811 --> 01:09:06.644
<v Speaker 2>fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super important to not be tired </v>

1518
01:09:09.170 --> 01:09:11.610
<v Speaker 2>while you're doing certain technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>work like you,</v>

1519
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:12.920
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tired,</v>

1520
01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:16.100
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to be exhausted </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your brain doesn't work,</v>

1521
01:09:16.101 --> 01:09:16.490
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1522
01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:19.310
<v Speaker 2>you drop your hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you develop shitty skills.</v>

1523
01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.183
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start making errors in your </v>

1524
01:09:22.671 --> 01:09:25.760
<v Speaker 2>technique and those errors and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>technique will manifest themselves under</v>

1525
01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:26.594
<v Speaker 2>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like one of the things about </v>

1526
01:09:28.161 --> 01:09:28.994
<v Speaker 2>fighting is it's super important that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do everything in training exactly </v>

1527
01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:34.700
<v Speaker 2>how you would do it if your fucking life</v>
<v Speaker 2>depended on it.</v>

1528
01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:35.773
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay a price like guys </v>

1529
01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:40.460
<v Speaker 2>who slack off in training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They almost never become champions.</v>

1530
01:09:40.461 --> 01:09:41.294
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're some physical freak who </v>

1531
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:43.080
<v Speaker 2>can get away with it.</v>

1532
01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:43.913
<v Speaker 2>The reality is in order to compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>against likeminded people that are also </v>

1533
01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.680
<v Speaker 2>phenomenally fit and motivated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the consequences of not being</v>

1534
01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:57.650
<v Speaker 2>fit and motivated and well trained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do everything right.</v>

1535
01:09:57.890 --> 01:10:00.830
<v Speaker 2>And especially now like mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get away with a lot.</v>

1536
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:01.830
<v Speaker 2>When I started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1537
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:06.260
<v Speaker 2>doing commentary in 1997,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get away with a lot because it</v>

1538
01:10:06.261 --> 01:10:07.094
<v Speaker 2>wasn't not a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just the level of competition </v>

1539
01:10:09.951 --> 01:10:10.784
<v Speaker 2>just was not the same as it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But now the people are so good that the </v>

1540
01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:14.684
<v Speaker 2>margin of error is so small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The difference between victory and </v>

1541
01:10:16.941 --> 01:10:21.830
<v Speaker 2>defeat is so small that it's just so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much high level activity going on in mma</v>

1542
01:10:21.831 --> 01:10:24.890
<v Speaker 2>fights that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't fuck around and anywhere where</v>

1543
01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:27.230
<v Speaker 2>your nutrition with your recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your,</v>

1544
01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.333
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the different things that </v>

1545
01:10:28.731 --> 01:10:29.564
<v Speaker 2>you're doing outside of training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like cryotherapy or floating or all </v>

1546
01:10:33.681 --> 01:10:34.820
<v Speaker 2>these different things that people do.</v>

1547
01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:35.983
<v Speaker 2>Sauna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's another thing that a lot of guys </v>

1548
01:10:36.861 --> 01:10:37.694
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those different things are like </v>

1549
01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.433
<v Speaker 2>hugely import because these little tiny </v>
<v Speaker 2>edges but also technique like your </v>

1550
01:10:42.891 --> 01:10:46.970
<v Speaker 2>technique has to be efficient and it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be correct so that in the heat of the</v>

1551
01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:48.330
<v Speaker 2>moment you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1552
01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.193
<v Speaker 2>you never think of doing things wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you've never done anything </v>

1553
01:10:51.111 --> 01:10:52.520
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time you're training,</v>

1554
01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:54.650
<v Speaker 2>you're doing things correctly and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>might not even save.</v>

1555
01:10:54.651 --> 01:10:57.110
<v Speaker 2>You still might get head kicked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're basically,</v>

1556
01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:59.390
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at when you're at your worst,</v>

1557
01:10:59.391 --> 01:11:00.950
<v Speaker 2>you're still the best yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1558
01:11:00.951 --> 01:11:02.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem.</v>

1559
01:11:02.511 --> 01:11:07.511
<v Speaker 2>The best fluctuates when you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with like world championship level,</v>

1560
01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:09.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like say like a division,</v>

1561
01:11:09.921 --> 01:11:13.320
<v Speaker 2>like say the UFC is 170 pound division,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very competitive division,</v>

1562
01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:14.633
<v Speaker 2>so competitive that the last title fight</v>
<v Speaker 2>resulted in a draw and one of the first </v>

1563
01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.940
<v Speaker 2>draws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's only three draws and the history</v>

1564
01:11:20.941 --> 01:11:22.260
<v Speaker 2>of the UFC and title fights.</v>

1565
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:26.130
<v Speaker 2>So this fight lines have been a draw and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then there's a bunch of other guys fuck.</v>

1566
01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:30.180
<v Speaker 2>And just straight killers waiting in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>wings to have their shot at the title.</v>

1567
01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.980
<v Speaker 2>So in any given day one of these guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>might be able to be one of those guys,</v>

1568
01:11:34.981 --> 01:11:35.814
<v Speaker 2>like one of these guys comes in a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit sick as a little bit of a cold from </v>

1569
01:11:38.371 --> 01:11:39.204
<v Speaker 2>training or maybe they're breaking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>with their girlfriend or heads a little </v>

1570
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:43.620
<v Speaker 2>fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which happens a lot.</v>

1571
01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1572
01:11:47.130 --> 01:11:48.860
<v Speaker 2>stay away from the ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1573
01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.050
<v Speaker 2>that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1574
01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:50.933
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes sometimes it's actually better</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have sex because then you're not </v>

1575
01:11:53.761 --> 01:11:55.350
<v Speaker 2>thinking about sex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1576
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.250
<v Speaker 2>but everybody hasn't really seen mindset</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time ran.</v>

1577
01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:58.721
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1578
01:11:58.721 --> 01:12:00.670
<v Speaker 2>you got to be off the ladies if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to train.</v>

1579
01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:02.643
<v Speaker 2>A lot of fighters do think that though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Hixon Gracie was one of the </v>

1580
01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.900
<v Speaker 2>greatest Jujitsu fighters were all time.</v>

1581
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:09.390
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't have sex for like months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>months out.</v>

1582
01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:12.600
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andre's just furious to be a Mike Tyson.</v>

1583
01:12:13.170 --> 01:12:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson would get his dick sucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>right before he knocked someone the fuck</v>

1584
01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:17.010
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't give a shit.</v>

1585
01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.840
<v Speaker 2>He was like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both you and I'm here for.</v>

1586
01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's a great quote.</v>

1587
01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:23.670
<v Speaker 2>Mike Tyson has a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

1588
01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:24.504
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a god invented anything better than </v>

1589
01:12:26.101 --> 01:12:26.934
<v Speaker 2>pussies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping it to himself so he would have </v>

1590
01:12:31.171 --> 01:12:33.660
<v Speaker 2>sex like right before he fought and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroy everybody.</v>

1591
01:12:33.661 --> 01:12:36.000
<v Speaker 2>So an interesting put that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

1592
01:12:36.001 --> 01:12:38.640
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not known to be a wordsmith either.</v>

1593
01:12:38.641 --> 01:12:43.260
<v Speaker 2>That's actually not the most educated </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy obviously,</v>

1594
01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:46.620
<v Speaker 2>but not a stupid man and any by any </v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch of the imagination.</v>

1595
01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I heard that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did,</v>

1596
01:12:47.851 --> 01:12:49.680
<v Speaker 2>it was fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard it's amazing.</v>

1597
01:12:49.681 --> 01:12:52.500
<v Speaker 2>I never got a chance to see it that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw the documentary,</v>

1598
01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.320
<v Speaker 2>but I never saw the live show is live </v>
<v Speaker 2>show is supposed to be amazing.</v>

1599
01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you did a standup show.</v>

1600
01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:58.051
<v Speaker 2>Sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1601
01:12:58.051 --> 01:12:59.640
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a story of his life.</v>

1602
01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be just insane.</v>

1603
01:13:03.181 --> 01:13:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Everybody that has seen it said you got </v>
<v Speaker 2>to see it.</v>

1604
01:13:05.001 --> 01:13:06.600
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>

1605
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:07.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>

1606
01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.050
<v Speaker 2>sex for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1607
01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:12.600
<v Speaker 2>He would have the sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not for everybody.</v>

1608
01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:13.613
<v Speaker 2>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's certainly lower your </v>

1609
01:13:14.671 --> 01:13:17.520
<v Speaker 2>testosterone a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean if you're fit and prepared,</v>

1610
01:13:17.521 --> 01:13:19.890
<v Speaker 2>it might relax you where you get a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>night's sleep,</v>

1611
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:21.283
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that's one of the things about </v>

1612
01:13:21.931 --> 01:13:25.470
<v Speaker 2>these guys is like anxiety,</v>
<v Speaker 2>staying up late,</v>

1613
01:13:25.530 --> 01:13:27.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just trying to get your shit together,</v>

1614
01:13:27.391 --> 01:13:29.200
<v Speaker 2>making sure you get a good night's sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you could,</v>

1615
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:31.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let the.</v>

1616
01:13:31.500 --> 01:13:34.020
<v Speaker 2>Don't be overwhelmed by the pressure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

1617
01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.650
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helia and you know,</v>

1618
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:38.513
<v Speaker 2>you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you've introduced the possibility </v>

1619
01:13:40.681 --> 01:13:45.681
<v Speaker 2>of just getting the shit kicked daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that raises the anxiety significantly.</v>

1620
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.823
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That now think about the anxiety of </v>

1621
01:13:49.741 --> 01:13:52.230
<v Speaker 2>releasing a perfect arrow on a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

1622
01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:53.393
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of anxiety involved in </v>

1623
01:13:54.271 --> 01:13:56.220
<v Speaker 2>that and it's something that people on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the outside,</v>

1624
01:13:56.550 --> 01:13:59.670
<v Speaker 2>I've heard people say ridiculous things </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to hunting,</v>

1625
01:13:59.671 --> 01:14:02.250
<v Speaker 2>but one of the most ridiculous things </v>
<v Speaker 2>that people have to say is,</v>

1626
01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no skill involved in that.</v>

1627
01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.310
<v Speaker 2>All you're doing is you're shooting a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defenseless animal like do you,</v>

1628
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:09.263
<v Speaker 2>you have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what you're talking </v>

1629
01:14:10.711 --> 01:14:12.160
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insanely difficult.</v>

1630
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.280
<v Speaker 5>It's so difficult to keep your shit </v>
<v Speaker 5>together and that moment.</v>

1631
01:14:15.490 --> 01:14:16.323
<v Speaker 5>And if you're a person who is </v>
<v Speaker 5>compassionate and who understands the </v>

1632
01:14:19.961 --> 01:14:23.170
<v Speaker 5>consequences of wounding an animal and </v>
<v Speaker 5>what's what's at stake here,</v>

1633
01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:24.243
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the responsibility of making a perfect </v>

1634
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:31.600
<v Speaker 5>shot and in a clean kill is very anxiety</v>
<v Speaker 5>filled moment.</v>

1635
01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you right now,</v>

1636
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:37.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been around a lot of death.</v>

1637
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm not necessarily by my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1638
01:14:40.081 --> 01:14:41.940
<v Speaker 1>doing the guidance gig and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1639
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1640
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:45.583
<v Speaker 1>I did not ever think I was susceptible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that anxiety of being behind the </v>

1641
01:14:48.691 --> 01:14:51.390
<v Speaker 1>trigger because I'd been around it so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>

1642
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:52.433
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm trying to say is once you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get that skill to be column behind the </v>

1643
01:14:56.221 --> 01:14:59.430
<v Speaker 1>trigger or on the string,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're releasing an arrow,</v>

1644
01:14:59.850 --> 01:15:02.130
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to stay with you.</v>

1645
01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.293
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an automatic deal because I </v>

1646
01:15:05.821 --> 01:15:09.660
<v Speaker 1>missed the largest mule deer in my life </v>
<v Speaker 1>this year with a rifle that really art.</v>

1647
01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:10.860
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's Neil dear?</v>

1648
01:15:10.861 --> 01:15:14.310
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen no bigger than the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you killed with Steve.</v>

1649
01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1650
01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:19.470
<v Speaker 1>That was massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one that Steve killed was huge.</v>

1651
01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:22.530
<v Speaker 1>How has it bigger this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

1652
01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:26.190
<v Speaker 1>I just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We hiked for a two and a half days.</v>

1653
01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.330
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1654
01:15:27.330 --> 01:15:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Kayla reared and he's the to boiled out </v>
<v Speaker 1>your mule deer skull.</v>

1655
01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:32.110
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your Montana animal.</v>

1656
01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:33.153
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1657
01:15:34.650 --> 01:15:36.380
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we hiked for two and a half days.</v>

1658
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:38.490
<v Speaker 1>He and he and his wife were having a </v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

1659
01:15:38.491 --> 01:15:39.324
<v Speaker 1>So we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to make this happen because we're </v>

1660
01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:43.320
<v Speaker 1>not going to happen next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far in did you guys go?</v>

1661
01:15:43.770 --> 01:15:45.450
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1662
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:49.680
<v Speaker 1>seven miles probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1663
01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.880
<v Speaker 1>so you're going over and under over </v>
<v Speaker 1>elevation climbing mountains.</v>

1664
01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:54.961
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

1665
01:15:54.961 --> 01:15:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big river crossing,</v>

1666
01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:00.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big climb,</v>

1667
01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:05.100
<v Speaker 1>try to follow a major drainage up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't find anything or found very,</v>

1668
01:16:05.101 --> 01:16:06.730
<v Speaker 1>very little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1669
01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:08.580
<v Speaker 1>just nasty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty country.</v>

1670
01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Finally find one mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fond sunsetting.</v>

1671
01:16:14.131 --> 01:16:15.840
<v Speaker 1>There's a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have your phone on this ridge line.</v>

1672
01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:17.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1673
01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:20.610
<v Speaker 1>let's just camp here because we have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave the next day.</v>

1674
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.610
<v Speaker 1>But that's the only sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little life that we saw.</v>

1675
01:16:24.050 --> 01:16:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we camped and tyler's all fraught</v>

1676
01:16:28.770 --> 01:16:31.590
<v Speaker 1>because he's got this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this would work out.</v>

1677
01:16:31.591 --> 01:16:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It was his spot wasn't my spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

1678
01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:41.420
<v Speaker 1>the next morning we get up and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stare at this hillside.</v>

1679
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
<v Speaker 1>Kaylee leaves to go take a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yeah,</v>

1680
01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.293
<v Speaker 1>four hours later there's a buck crosses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't get a range on my range </v>

1681
01:16:51.901 --> 01:16:54.930
<v Speaker 1>finder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too far away and I'm just pissed at</v>

1682
01:16:54.931 --> 01:16:57.450
<v Speaker 1>the whole situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyler comes over and he's like,</v>

1683
01:16:57.451 --> 01:16:58.380
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found some deer,</v>

1684
01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:00.083
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we slipped around and in this tiny </v>

1685
01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:10.010
<v Speaker 1>little you had to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It something you could see</v>

1686
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:10.843
<v Speaker 4>from two miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You had to like stumble into this </v>

1687
01:17:13.071 --> 01:17:16.610
<v Speaker 4>pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were seven bucks chasing one doe,</v>

1688
01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:19.160
<v Speaker 4>seven year old yearbooks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jason Window,</v>

1689
01:17:19.250 --> 01:17:23.960
<v Speaker 4>and we're looking at these deer and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>were so far in it.</v>

1690
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:27.180
<v Speaker 4>Typically you're just not going to shoot</v>
<v Speaker 4>a buck for me.</v>

1691
01:17:27.181 --> 01:17:32.181
<v Speaker 4>When you're that far in m and a,</v>

1692
01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:34.230
<v Speaker 2>when you mean when you say a buck for </v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

1693
01:17:34.231 --> 01:17:38.040
<v Speaker 2>you mean a small book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A smaller book is you've put out so much</v>

1694
01:17:38.041 --> 01:17:39.720
<v Speaker 2>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would like to get an older,</v>

1695
01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:44.721
<v Speaker 2>mature animal when you're that far in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the course kind of exceptionally.</v>

1696
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1697
01:17:46.231 --> 01:17:47.670
<v Speaker 2>But for people to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the uninitiated,</v>

1698
01:17:47.671 --> 01:17:50.130
<v Speaker 2>which a lot of people listening to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>are that meet buck,</v>

1699
01:17:50.131 --> 01:17:53.490
<v Speaker 2>you would think of like a young fork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buck doesn't have big antlers.</v>

1700
01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:54.503
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about you're looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a big mature animal looking for a </v>

1701
01:17:56.651 --> 01:17:58.980
<v Speaker 2>big contract animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a difficult challenge.</v>

1702
01:17:58.981 --> 01:18:01.110
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot involved in an animal like</v>

1703
01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:03.510
<v Speaker 2>that and it's also an animal that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly as bread,</v>

1704
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.843
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spreads genes and so it's a good animal </v>

1705
01:18:06.751 --> 01:18:10.080
<v Speaker 2>to take out of the gene pool to allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>other animals to also breed</v>

1706
01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.003
<v Speaker 4>and in fact this is the only dear only </v>
<v Speaker 4>buck in that group that was going the </v>

1707
01:18:14.251 --> 01:18:17.790
<v Speaker 4>complete opposite direction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so everybody else,</v>

1708
01:18:17.791 --> 01:18:18.624
<v Speaker 4>all his buddies were on that doe </v>
<v Speaker 4>following her and he was gone the </v>

1709
01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:25.410
<v Speaker 4>opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Smart.</v>

1710
01:18:25.470 --> 01:18:26.610
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen bitch,</v>

1711
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.740
<v Speaker 4>I ain't got no time for these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>games.</v>

1712
01:18:28.741 --> 01:18:30.810
<v Speaker 4>You find me hooker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck.</v>

1713
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:32.223

<v Speaker 4>honey.</v>

1714
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:33.463

<v Speaker 4>week and I missed that thing at 90 yards</v>

<v Speaker 4>with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you punch?</v>

1719

1727
01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:12.600
<v Speaker 4>I had had a round in the chamber finger </v>
<v Speaker 4>was off the trigger.</v>

1728
01:19:12.601 --> 01:19:14.790
<v Speaker 4>I was just waiting for him to step into </v>
<v Speaker 4>that opening.</v>

1729
01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:17.970
<v Speaker 4>Cross hairs were there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As soon as his nose came into the scope,</v>

1730
01:19:17.971 --> 01:19:20.810
<v Speaker 4>I pulled the trigger and went right in </v>
<v Speaker 4>front of them.</v>

1731
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.673
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1732
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:22.920
<v Speaker 4>you panicked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1733
01:19:22.921 --> 01:19:26.610
<v Speaker 4>I've lost it because he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you saw those antlers.</v>

1734
01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:28.013
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never even looked at the buck through </v>

1735
01:19:30.061 --> 01:19:34.230
<v Speaker 4>my binoculars because I knew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just knew how big it was.</v>

1736
01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.730
<v Speaker 4>How big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you think he was?</v>

1737
01:19:35.790 --> 01:19:37.380
<v Speaker 4>If you had to guess,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like inches wise?</v>

1738
01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:38.363
<v Speaker 4>I would say once in two lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I will never see a deer like a to </v>

1739
01:19:41.971 --> 01:19:42.804
<v Speaker 4>90.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like one of those Arizona's trip </v>

1740
01:19:45.361 --> 01:19:47.370
<v Speaker 4>bucks for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1741
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:48.421
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>

1742
01:19:48.421 --> 01:19:52.700
<v Speaker 4>But I would say it was well over over </v>
<v Speaker 4>well over the 2:20</v>

1743
01:19:52.710 --> 01:19:53.620
<v Speaker 4>mark was wasn't my</v>

1744
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:56.160
<v Speaker 2>for people don't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

1745
01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.090
<v Speaker 2>that's like me with my arms out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how big the antlers are.</v>

1746
01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:05.850
<v Speaker 4>If you see that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is that there should be a lot of.</v>

1747
01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:08.100
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a of misery and seeing that</v>

1748
01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:08.933
<v Speaker 2>thing for it should be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a major pat on the back because that's </v>

1749
01:20:12.991 --> 01:20:14.730
<v Speaker 2>just something nobody gets to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1750
01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:15.690
<v Speaker 2>It's super rare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1751
01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.440
<v Speaker 2>To for them to get that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's genetics age.</v>

1752
01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:22.920
<v Speaker 2>That's a wise animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot involved certainly in that</v>

1753
01:20:22.921 --> 01:20:24.030
<v Speaker 2>unit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1754
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:25.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was just so over the counter </v>

1755
01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:28.340
<v Speaker 2>unit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

1756
01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:31.310
<v Speaker 2>Which means that for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uninitiated,</v>

1757
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:32.350
<v Speaker 2>you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>

1758
01:20:32.610 --> 01:20:35.550
<v Speaker 2>For a lot of places like where I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>said the Arizona Strip,</v>

1759
01:20:35.551 --> 01:20:36.384
<v Speaker 2>the Arizona Strip is like this legendary</v>
<v Speaker 2>area that borders between Utah and </v>

1760
01:20:39.391 --> 01:20:40.224
<v Speaker 2>Arizona and it has these monster mule </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer and it like every year they pull </v>

1761
01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:47.400
<v Speaker 2>these just insane deer out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got over 300 inches,</v>

1762
01:20:47.401 --> 01:20:51.810
<v Speaker 2>which is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like the one 10th of one percent of</v>

1763
01:20:51.811 --> 01:20:52.644
<v Speaker 2>the world's population of deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so rare to see an animal this </v>

1764
01:20:56.521 --> 01:20:59.760
<v Speaker 2>big and this one area consistently </v>
<v Speaker 2>produces these animals,</v>

1765
01:20:59.761 --> 01:21:02.790
<v Speaker 2>so it's really hard to get a tag there </v>
<v Speaker 2>really hard.</v>

1766
01:21:02.790 --> 01:21:05.490
<v Speaker 2>Like you could put it in for 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and still not get it.</v>

1767
01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:09.150
<v Speaker 2>What that means is there might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands and thousands of people.</v>

1768
01:21:09.151 --> 01:21:09.984
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are thousands of people that have </v>

1769
01:21:11.191 --> 01:21:15.480
<v Speaker 2>putting in for a tag there and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>might pick a very small amount.</v>

1770
01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:16.890
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very small amount.</v>

1771
01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was like an animal for there and</v>

1772
01:21:19.711 --> 01:21:21.000
<v Speaker 2>this is something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

1773
01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:23.070
<v Speaker 2>no excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shoot a ton.</v>

1774
01:21:23.071 --> 01:21:24.990
<v Speaker 2>We have a reloading bench in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basement.</v>

1775
01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.000
<v Speaker 2>We shoot our bows in the basement of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>

1776
01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.193
<v Speaker 2>We have multiple shooting facilities </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we can go to within 15 minutes of </v>

1777
01:21:32.581 --> 01:21:35.190
<v Speaker 2>the office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spend a ton of time behind the trigger.</v>

1778
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:37.470
<v Speaker 2>Do you have a process that you do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>your mind,</v>

1779
01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:39.600
<v Speaker 2>like when you see an animal in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to pull the trigger?</v>

1780
01:21:39.601 --> 01:21:41.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you have like a thing that you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1781
01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:44.040
<v Speaker 2>because they say that that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing to have.</v>

1782
01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Like almost like a mantra for our trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that more you do it,</v>

1783
01:21:49.231 --> 01:21:50.064
<v Speaker 2>the better you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the way you take care Arrow out of </v>

1784
01:21:51.931 --> 01:21:53.940
<v Speaker 2>the quiver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you put it on the string,</v>

1785
01:21:53.970 --> 01:21:58.020
<v Speaker 2>like you want that to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If fewer just gripped,</v>

1786
01:21:58.050 --> 01:21:59.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just happens.</v>

1787
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Exactly like fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say that same exact thing,</v>

1788
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.863
<v Speaker 2>same exact thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with anxiety and having </v>

1789
01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:10.911
<v Speaker 2>this pattern that you've carved so </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeply into your mind and your body,</v>

1790
01:22:12.111 --> 01:22:15.510
<v Speaker 2>your neurons that your body just knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically.</v>

1791
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:16.663
<v Speaker 2>Like when I was competing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was moments where I did something </v>

1792
01:22:19.111 --> 01:22:19.944
<v Speaker 2>where I didn't even know I did it and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was already basically don't even </v>

1793
01:22:23.191 --> 01:22:24.024
<v Speaker 2>remember what the hell you're just </v>
<v Speaker 2>moving on this total reaction and </v>

1794
01:22:27.331 --> 01:22:28.164
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1795
01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:29.133
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for a archers that moment like you </v>

1796
01:22:32.341 --> 01:22:36.480
<v Speaker 2>have to kind of like carve that path </v>
<v Speaker 2>also because like if you're,</v>

1797
01:22:36.630 --> 01:22:37.463
<v Speaker 2>if you're fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get to spar a lot so you get to hit </v>

1798
01:22:40.171 --> 01:22:41.100
<v Speaker 2>people a lot.</v>

1799
01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.860
<v Speaker 2>You get used to the idea of moving away </v>
<v Speaker 2>and hitting someone.</v>

1800
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:46.050
<v Speaker 2>But how often do you get to shoot an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal?</v>

1801
01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1802
01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:51.060
<v Speaker 2>it's really rare when I shoot one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe once a six months,</v>

1803
01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once a once a year.</v>

1804
01:22:53.281 --> 01:22:55.530
<v Speaker 2>If you're a busy person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're lucky,</v>

1805
01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:56.673
<v Speaker 2>maybe you go a year and you don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a shot at one because you don't to </v>

1806
01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:01.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe get this one trip a year and like </v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

1807
01:23:01.740 --> 01:23:02.573
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go somewhere and like you were </v>

1808
01:23:03.601 --> 01:23:04.434
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't see anything until you saw </v>

1809
01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 2>that fond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That could have been the</v>

1810
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.873
<v Speaker 5>whole trip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could have been the happens all the </v>

1811
01:23:08.141 --> 01:23:08.950
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Go,</v>

1812
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:11.710
<v Speaker 5>you'll be an outfit for days and days </v>
<v Speaker 5>and days you don't see a goddamn thing.</v>

1813
01:23:11.711 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 5>And then next year comes along and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>next year sucks too.</v>

1814
01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:16.810
<v Speaker 5>And then the year after that you finally</v>
<v Speaker 5>get her shot.</v>

1815
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:18.050
<v Speaker 5>Knowing Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your,</v>

1816
01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:21.100
<v Speaker 5>your whole body's just wracked with </v>
<v Speaker 5>anticipation and nerves.</v>

1817
01:23:21.101 --> 01:23:23.650
<v Speaker 5>And I've seen people where their legs </v>
<v Speaker 5>are shaking,</v>

1818
01:23:23.651 --> 01:23:26.140
<v Speaker 5>their arms are shaking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I've seen videos where guys hunting</v>

1819
01:23:26.141 --> 01:23:29.440
<v Speaker 5>elk where you see their arms shaking as </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're pulling back.</v>

1820
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:31.730
<v Speaker 5>Their bodies just jacked with </v>
<v Speaker 5>adrenaline.</v>

1821
01:23:31.731 --> 01:23:35.470
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't change and they just try to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep that pen in the general area.</v>

1822
01:23:35.471 --> 01:23:38.440
<v Speaker 5>That animal pull through the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>For those of you who don't know,</v>

1823
01:23:38.441 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 5>this is like stepping into a place that </v>
<v Speaker 5>you have never been before.</v>

1824
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:43.533
<v Speaker 5>You're not sure what's going on and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>whistle and a six to 800 pound animal </v>

1825
01:23:51.021 --> 01:23:51.854
<v Speaker 5>with big chunks of shirt bone coming out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of its head and it's dick slapping </v>

1826
01:23:56.981 --> 01:23:59.440
<v Speaker 5>against the belly,</v>
<v Speaker 5>literally piss all over the place,</v>

1827
01:23:59.441 --> 01:24:00.274
<v Speaker 5>wants to come in and either mount you </v>
<v Speaker 5>from behind or beat the piss out of you </v>

1828
01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:04.953
<v Speaker 5>or stab you with his antlers.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a forest horse with swords growing </v>

1829
01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:09.420
<v Speaker 5>out of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1830
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.880
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's.</v>

1831
01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:12.640
<v Speaker 5>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're amazing and you freak out,</v>

1832
01:24:12.641 --> 01:24:14.230
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

1833
01:24:14.231 --> 01:24:18.010
<v Speaker 5>But a one every five.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're an archery hunter,</v>

1834
01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:21.820
<v Speaker 5>once one bowl every five years or one </v>
<v Speaker 5>successful,</v>

1835
01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:23.843
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1836
01:24:24.080 --> 01:24:24.913
<v Speaker 5>season in five is the national average.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why Kim Haines is such a freak </v>

1837
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:31.850
<v Speaker 5>because he has not been a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

1838
01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:36.880
<v Speaker 5>he hasn't been unsuccessful on an </v>
<v Speaker 5>archery hunt since 2009.</v>

1839

<v Speaker 5>looking at.</v>

<v Speaker 5>something that's insanely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But to the uninitiated or the people </v>

1855
01:25:23.931 --> 01:25:27.470
<v Speaker 5>that just have never experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looks like he's a animal.</v>

<v Speaker 6>it's almost like a robotic action when </v>

1862
01:25:48.661 --> 01:25:50.730
<v Speaker 6>it's go time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like sit there,</v>

<v Speaker 6>the way they reload on target,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on glass like it,</v>

1871
01:26:04.090 --> 01:26:04.923
<v Speaker 5>well that's a totally different world </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you have to shoot people and </v>

1872
01:26:07.271 --> 01:26:10.250
<v Speaker 5>they're trying to shoot you to think of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the anticipation.</v>

1873
01:26:10.251 --> 01:26:13.010
<v Speaker 5>The anxiety is involved in shooting a </v>
<v Speaker 5>beautiful deer like you missed.</v>

1874
01:26:13.310 --> 01:26:18.170
<v Speaker 5>Now imagine that's some urine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some foreign land and this is some enemy</v>

1875
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:21.170
<v Speaker 5>guy that you're engaging with and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to kill you and you know,</v>

1876
01:26:21.171 --> 01:26:24.320
<v Speaker 5>like you ain't gotta be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's where legit.</v>

1877
01:26:24.321 --> 01:26:26.620
<v Speaker 5>Like that's one of the interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know Joel Turner's?</v>

1878
01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:30.410
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joel Turner has a whole series on target</v>

1879
01:26:30.411 --> 01:26:32.690
<v Speaker 5>panic for archery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's really interesting.</v>

1880
01:26:32.691 --> 01:26:36.740
<v Speaker 5>It's an online series.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What was it called?</v>

1881
01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.493
<v Speaker 5>Something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See if he could find the name of </v>

1882
01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:41.460
<v Speaker 5>traditional.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

1883
01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.760
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A like Denver.</v>

1884
01:26:43.761 --> 01:26:46.460
<v Speaker 5>Maybe something like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not sure where he's out of,</v>

1885
01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:50.110
<v Speaker 4>but it's an instinct fighting instinct </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>

1886
01:26:50.250 --> 01:26:54.240
<v Speaker 5>No iron mind guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1887
01:26:54.490 --> 01:26:55.323
<v Speaker 5>Closed loop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>open loop guy and he's got this whole </v>

1888
01:26:58.950 --> 01:27:03.090
<v Speaker 5>system that he's put together and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>actually paid for it and wash it.</v>

1889
01:27:03.091 --> 01:27:05.130
<v Speaker 5>Very good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Very well thought out.</v>

1890
01:27:05.131 --> 01:27:05.964
<v Speaker 5>Very interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But a lot of it is on the mindset </v>

1891
01:27:07.081 --> 01:27:10.020
<v Speaker 5>because he was a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was training police officers.</v>

1892
01:27:10.330 --> 01:27:15.330
<v Speaker 5>He's training like Swat team members and</v>
<v Speaker 5>how to keep it together in the middle of</v>

1893
01:27:15.361 --> 01:27:16.194
<v Speaker 5>a firefight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he actually was talking in one of </v>

1894
01:27:18.751 --> 01:27:19.584
<v Speaker 5>the interviews that I saw him in about a</v>
<v Speaker 5>conversation that he had with a police </v>

1895
01:27:23.611 --> 01:27:27.990
<v Speaker 5>officer that was in a firefight with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>bad guy and heard this,</v>

1896
01:27:28.110 --> 01:27:28.943
<v Speaker 5>heard his words and his instructions </v>
<v Speaker 5>going through an executed correctly and </v>

1897
01:27:31.861 --> 01:27:35.070
<v Speaker 5>did the right thing while this guy's </v>
<v Speaker 5>shooting in his car window and glass was</v>

1898
01:27:35.071 --> 01:27:38.310
<v Speaker 5>flying and bullets are flying at him and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he stayed calm and killed.</v>

1899
01:27:38.311 --> 01:27:40.530
<v Speaker 5>This guy was shooting at him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that,</v>

1900
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:45.480
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that this process of having a thing that</v>

1901
01:27:45.481 --> 01:27:46.314
<v Speaker 5>you like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a mantra that you relay into your head </v>

1902
01:27:47.521 --> 01:27:51.120
<v Speaker 5>that relates to a physical action and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you drill it in yourself.</v>

1903
01:27:51.121 --> 01:27:53.250
<v Speaker 5>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's unavoidable.</v>

1904
01:27:53.251 --> 01:27:54.330
<v Speaker 5>Like this is how you do things.</v>

1905
01:27:55.650 --> 01:27:56.483
<v Speaker 4>That situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We described what the bowl coming in </v>

1906
01:27:58.711 --> 01:28:00.250
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1907
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:02.970
<v Speaker 4>you shake your head goes a million miles</v>
<v Speaker 4>an hour.</v>

1908
01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:05.700
<v Speaker 4>Like if you don't have something to fall</v>
<v Speaker 4>back on,</v>

1909
01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:09.290
<v Speaker 4>the odds of you making a mistake I feel </v>
<v Speaker 4>are way higher than you.</v>

1910
01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:10.760
<v Speaker 5>Successful.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1911
01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:11.753
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You gotta there's gotTa be a thing in </v>

1912
01:28:13.261 --> 01:28:16.440
<v Speaker 5>your brain that you can like press play </v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

1913
01:28:16.890 --> 01:28:19.470
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then once you do that you could like</v>

1914
01:28:19.471 --> 01:28:22.020
<v Speaker 5>there was an article that I read </v>
<v Speaker 5>recently about a,</v>

1915
01:28:22.021 --> 01:28:22.854
<v Speaker 5>it was about choking and sports and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was essentially there's the article was </v>

1916
01:28:27.031 --> 01:28:27.864
<v Speaker 5>essentially saying that what you have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>do is figure out a process that removes </v>

1917
01:28:31.891 --> 01:28:32.724
<v Speaker 5>your conscious mind from the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like figure out a process of training </v>

1918
01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:37.980
<v Speaker 5>where you know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like someone's,</v>

1919
01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:39.810
<v Speaker 5>you have a basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone's coming at you,</v>

1920
01:28:39.811 --> 01:28:41.190
<v Speaker 5>you juke left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You go right.</v>

1921
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:42.143
<v Speaker 5>You know how to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you've done it so many times that this </v>

1922
01:28:43.621 --> 01:28:44.454
<v Speaker 5>is just a natural reaction and get it to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the point where you don't have to think </v>

1923
01:28:46.981 --> 01:28:50.850
<v Speaker 5>about it so you're not overwhelmed by </v>
<v Speaker 5>this moment in the anticipation of,</v>

1924
01:28:50.851 --> 01:28:52.380
<v Speaker 5>what if I fuck this up?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

1925
01:28:52.381 --> 01:28:54.390
<v Speaker 5>so many people are watching what happens</v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

1926
01:28:54.391 --> 01:28:55.224
<v Speaker 5>What if I do that and you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You'll see those moments where people </v>

1927
01:28:57.511 --> 01:29:01.860
<v Speaker 5>just lock up and they panic.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You see seen in fighting all the time.</v>

1928
01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:07.500
<v Speaker 6>The tradco thing versus a compound or </v>
<v Speaker 6>recurve,</v>

1929
01:29:07.501 --> 01:29:09.800
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>That introduces.</v>

1930
01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.860
<v Speaker 6>That's when this shit can get crazy </v>
<v Speaker 6>because say with the compound,</v>

1931
01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:15.360
<v Speaker 6>you draw back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you hit the wall,</v>

1932
01:29:15.390 --> 01:29:17.310
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The bow only drawback so far.</v>

1933
01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:19.410
<v Speaker 6>You look through a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'd let it up with another whole.</v>

1934
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:20.550
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't get me wrong,</v>

1935
01:29:20.551 --> 01:29:22.770
<v Speaker 6>it's no picnic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then you know,</v>

1936
01:29:22.890 --> 01:29:26.890
<v Speaker 6>once you start shooting in traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's nothing that's super repeatable.</v>

1937
01:29:26.891 --> 01:29:27.724
<v Speaker 6>I mean you try to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you pull it back as far or if you </v>

1938
01:29:30.871 --> 01:29:32.400
<v Speaker 6>don't pull back far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you goof up.</v>

1939
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:33.263
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's no aiming and it's a funny </v>

1940
01:29:35.911 --> 01:29:36.744
<v Speaker 6>experience when all the sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the first time you draw back on anime </v>

1941
01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:39.674
<v Speaker 6>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the hell is go like there's no </v>

1942
01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:42.870
<v Speaker 6>reference,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1943
01:29:42.871 --> 01:29:44.760
<v Speaker 6>Your brain is just kind of bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 6>around.</v>

1944
01:29:44.761 --> 01:29:46.650
<v Speaker 6>And I think where that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1945
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:48.600
<v Speaker 6>what was the guy's name?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Joel Turner.</v>

1946
01:29:48.650 --> 01:29:49.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Where he is just.</v>

1947
01:29:50.730 --> 01:29:54.090
<v Speaker 2>And he shoots with us some loop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He shoots Mongol Scott,</v>

1948
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:58.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mongol style is the Mongols used to have</v>

1949
01:29:58.141 --> 01:30:00.450
<v Speaker 2>a thumb ring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have a bone ring.</v>

1950
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.313
<v Speaker 2>I've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would wear around their thumb and </v>

1951
01:30:02.521 --> 01:30:04.800
<v Speaker 2>that's what would fit on the groove of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the string.</v>

1952
01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:05.843
<v Speaker 2>So they'd hook the string with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>thumb and then close their index finger </v>

1953
01:30:08.161 --> 01:30:10.560
<v Speaker 2>over it and they would draw back like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

1954
01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:13.830
<v Speaker 2>And according to Dan Carlin from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've never heard this before,</v>

1955
01:30:13.831 --> 01:30:15.150
<v Speaker 2>if you've heard me rant about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>

1956
01:30:15.151 --> 01:30:17.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just ignore me for a moment.</v>

1957
01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:19.830
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a amazing,</v>

1958
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:23.220
<v Speaker 2>a podcast series called hardcore </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

1959
01:30:23.221 --> 01:30:25.580
<v Speaker 2>It's by this guy who's a friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name's Dan Carlin's,</v>

1960
01:30:25.581 --> 01:30:29.320
<v Speaker 2>says genius historian who's so good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>relaying.</v>

1961
01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:30.720
<v Speaker 2>He'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll say he's not a historian.</v>

1962
01:30:30.721 --> 01:30:32.520
<v Speaker 2>He definitely is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's super humble guy,</v>

1963
01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:33.473
<v Speaker 2>but he's so good at relaying information</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an entertaining and dramatic fashion </v>

1964
01:30:39.211 --> 01:30:43.950
<v Speaker 2>and he has a series called the wrath of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Khan and it's a five part series.</v>

1965
01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.870
<v Speaker 2>You have to pay for it now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1966
01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:48.450
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a dollar an episode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so worth it.</v>

1967
01:30:48.451 --> 01:30:49.284
<v Speaker 2>It's worth 100 times more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a five part episode on the </v>

1968
01:30:52.081 --> 01:30:52.914
<v Speaker 2>Mongols.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said that their bows were like </v>

1969
01:30:54.001 --> 01:30:54.834
<v Speaker 2>160 pounds raw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just these sinewy fucking </v>

1970
01:30:57.451 --> 01:31:00.450
<v Speaker 2>savages that were incredible archers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that were.</v>

1971
01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:01.493
<v Speaker 2>They had developed this ability to </v>
<v Speaker 2>release the Arrow as the horse was in </v>

1972
01:31:04.741 --> 01:31:05.574
<v Speaker 2>its Gallup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when the horse was in the air where </v>

1973
01:31:07.291 --> 01:31:08.124
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't a disturbance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they would time the release of the </v>

1974
01:31:10.321 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Arrow to when the horse was actually in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the air force.</v>

1975
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:14.303
<v Speaker 2>They had it down and the had a thumb </v>
<v Speaker 2>ring and that's how they would draw </v>

1976
01:31:17.581 --> 01:31:18.840
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not with your fingers,</v>

1977
01:31:18.841 --> 01:31:19.674
<v Speaker 2>like most people do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would draw back with the thumb </v>

1978
01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:23.580
<v Speaker 2>loop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the index finger over the thumb.</v>

1979
01:31:23.581 --> 01:31:26.850
<v Speaker 2>And for some reason they found that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a better method day.</v>

1980
01:31:26.890 --> 01:31:28.060
<v Speaker 6>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like a,</v>

1981
01:31:28.450 --> 01:31:30.340
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like a primitive release.</v>

1982
01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:31.920
<v Speaker 6>That's the thing with the traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1983
01:31:31.930 --> 01:31:33.520
<v Speaker 6>Your fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can pluck,</v>

1984
01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:35.560
<v Speaker 6>you can just hit 100 different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 6>screw up.</v>

1985
01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:37.570
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you had that right,</v>

1986
01:31:37.571 --> 01:31:39.760
<v Speaker 6>you let go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's probably a lot more consistent.</v>

1987
01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.573
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other is you could see that that's </v>

1988
01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:47.460
<v Speaker 2>the bone thumb rings and a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to shoot that way.</v>

1989
01:31:47.461 --> 01:31:48.294
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of interesting stuff </v>

1990
01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:51.660
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And see how it holds.</v>

1991
01:31:51.661 --> 01:31:56.661
<v Speaker 2>And then you throw your finger over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top of that thumb ring and you know,</v>

1992
01:31:56.821 --> 01:31:57.654
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your thumb pushes back on it and you </v>

1993
01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:01.540
<v Speaker 2>need your finger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your index finger closes over the top of</v>

1994
01:32:01.541 --> 01:32:04.420
<v Speaker 2>your thumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not dissimilar to a lot,</v>

1995
01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:06.550
<v Speaker 2>to a release a lot of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1996
01:32:07.210 --> 01:32:07.900
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1997
01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:10.990
<v Speaker 2>when I shoot a compound bow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shoot a,</v>

1998
01:32:10.991 --> 01:32:14.500
<v Speaker 2>I use a Carter release thumb trigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>release.</v>

1999
01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:18.520
<v Speaker 2>It's a good tension is I use one called </v>
<v Speaker 2>the wise choice.</v>

2000
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:19.383
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2001
01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:21.510
<v Speaker 2>but I use attention based one to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution,</v>

2002
01:32:21.511 --> 01:32:22.344
<v Speaker 2>or is one that John Dudley put out </v>
<v Speaker 2>called the silver back that are really </v>

2003
01:32:24.271 --> 01:32:25.150
<v Speaker 2>prepped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurry up.</v>

2004
01:32:25.410 --> 01:32:26.180
<v Speaker 2>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2005
01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:26.831
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2006
01:32:26.831 --> 01:32:29.610
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't because it's the same motion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2007
01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:32.560
<v Speaker 2>the idea is you don't ever pull the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trigger.</v>

2008
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:34.210
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you lock in,</v>

2009
01:32:34.211 --> 01:32:36.370
<v Speaker 2>you pull in place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put your thumb over the trigger.</v>

2010
01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.353
<v Speaker 2>Then once you're in place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you concentrate on the muscles that are </v>

2011
01:32:38.921 --> 01:32:39.754
<v Speaker 2>in the center of your back and you pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>those and the release goes off and you </v>

2012
01:32:42.491 --> 01:32:45.460
<v Speaker 2>get a surprise shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea behind that is there's never</v>

2013
01:32:45.461 --> 01:32:50.080
<v Speaker 2>a moment in your life now and you punch </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and then you move the Arrow where you</v>

2014
01:32:50.081 --> 01:32:50.914
<v Speaker 2>move the boats or did I get it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's all that shit is out of </v>

2015
01:32:53.201 --> 01:32:54.034
<v Speaker 2>your head because all you're doing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shot process is pulling and </v>

2016
01:32:57.101 --> 01:33:00.760
<v Speaker 2>concentrating on those muscles and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>center of your back and your scapula and</v>

2017
01:33:00.761 --> 01:33:02.470
<v Speaker 2>contracting those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you do that,</v>

2018
01:33:02.471 --> 01:33:03.304
<v Speaker 2>they released just goes off because your</v>
<v Speaker 2>thumb is pressing against that trigger </v>

2019
01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:06.630
<v Speaker 2>and it just goes.</v>

2020
01:33:06.630 --> 01:33:07.463
<v Speaker 2>And.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to resist that urge that </v>

2021
01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:09.784
<v Speaker 2>everybody has just now now punching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the difference between like </v>

2022
01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:16.810
<v Speaker 2>John Dudley's approach versus Joel </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] approach like John Doe,</v>

2023
01:33:16.870 --> 01:33:17.703
<v Speaker 2>Joel Turner has the same approach and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even talks about it when it comes to </v>

2024
01:33:21.340 --> 01:33:25.840
<v Speaker 2>compound bows of using a thumb trigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>of polling and letting you know,</v>

2025
01:33:25.841 --> 01:33:29.650
<v Speaker 2>letting the shot go off automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Dudley,</v>

2026
01:33:30.310 --> 01:33:33.850
<v Speaker 2>he thinks that you should start off </v>
<v Speaker 2>using attention based release,</v>

2027
01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.900
<v Speaker 2>which the way that works is you actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold the safety,</v>

2028
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:39.130
<v Speaker 2>hold the trigger until you lock in </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

2029
01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Then once you're ready to execute your </v>
<v Speaker 2>release,</v>

2030
01:33:41.321 --> 01:33:42.154
<v Speaker 2>the safety and all it takes is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple extra pounds of pulling and it </v>

2031
01:33:44.981 --> 01:33:46.390
<v Speaker 2>goes off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

2032
01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like a Carter evolution or he.</v>

2033
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:52.930
<v Speaker 2>He has one that he makes called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>silver back that is a two finger version</v>

2034
01:33:52.931 --> 01:33:53.764
<v Speaker 2>of the Carter evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he feels like the least amount of </v>

2035
01:33:55.961 --> 01:33:57.100
<v Speaker 2>fingers that you have on it.</v>

2036
01:33:57.130 --> 01:33:57.963
<v Speaker 2>The least amount of tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the point to try to do </v>

2037
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:01.840
<v Speaker 2>people like what the fuck are you </v>
<v Speaker 2>rambling about?</v>

2038
01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:04.120
<v Speaker 2>What I'm trying to randomly about like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2039
01:34:04.121 --> 01:34:04.954
<v Speaker 2>this thing is insanely complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to the people that look at this and </v>

2040
01:34:09.341 --> 01:34:10.270
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2041
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:11.104
<v Speaker 2>there's no skill involved and Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just killing this defenseless </v>

2042
01:34:13.391 --> 01:34:17.530
<v Speaker 2>animal like is the most difficult way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get your food.</v>

2043
01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:19.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the most difficult way.</v>

2044
01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:23.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no more difficult way to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>your food than shooting an animal with a</v>

2045
01:34:23.471 --> 01:34:24.304
<v Speaker 2>bow and arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't exist unless you want to </v>

2046
01:34:25.961 --> 01:34:27.820
<v Speaker 2>fucking use a spear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make.</v>

2047
01:34:27.850 --> 01:34:28.683
<v Speaker 2>I guess it is not getting growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could to jump out of a tree </v>

2048
01:34:31.211 --> 01:34:32.200
<v Speaker 2>with a knife and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2049
01:34:32.610 --> 01:34:35.540
<v Speaker 2>but that stupid mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is that,</v>

2050
01:34:35.541 --> 01:34:37.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the animal comes for your strategy.</v>

2051
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:42.550
<v Speaker 2>Like for me it fit is proficient and </v>
<v Speaker 2>proven.</v>

2052
01:34:42.701 --> 01:34:43.534
<v Speaker 2>Be Proficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Kevin and I were making the switch </v>

2053
01:34:45.011 --> 01:34:48.580
<v Speaker 2>to go back to traditional archery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why'd you guys decide to do that?</v>

2054
01:34:49.180 --> 01:34:51.820
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got so tired of the stuff.</v>

2055
01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:54.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tough stuff.</v>

2056
01:34:54.161 --> 01:34:56.020
<v Speaker 2>Changing every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Sites,</v>

2057
01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:57.750
<v Speaker 2>new strings this new.</v>

2058
01:34:58.090 --> 01:35:01.780
<v Speaker 4>I got to hate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hate setting up a compound bow.</v>

2059
01:35:01.781 --> 01:35:03.010
<v Speaker 4>I hated it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why?</v>

2060
01:35:03.190 --> 01:35:05.920
<v Speaker 4>Because there's just so much going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

2061
01:35:05.921 --> 01:35:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that me?</v>

2062
01:35:07.330 --> 01:35:09.190
<v Speaker 4>Or is the bowl out of tune,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did my string stretch</v>

2063
01:35:09.670 --> 01:35:13.380
<v Speaker 2>timing and twisting your strings and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going back</v>

2064
01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:14.870
<v Speaker 6>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to get a job.</v>

2065
01:35:14.970 --> 01:35:16.670
<v Speaker 6>I like to cows point plus.</v>

2066
01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:19.410
<v Speaker 2>What are you going back to traditional?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going back to compound</v>

2067
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:20.623
<v Speaker 6>back to compound a company is making a </v>
<v Speaker 6>called [inaudible] really nice bose and </v>

2068
01:35:24.891 --> 01:35:25.970
<v Speaker 6>our camouflage pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm,</v>

2069
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:27.410
<v Speaker 6>I'm pretty excited.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And plus,</v>

2070
01:35:27.411 --> 01:35:28.140
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

2071
01:35:28.140 --> 01:35:31.310
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've had very mixed success.</v>

2072
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:33.200
<v Speaker 6>I would say I struggled a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2073
01:35:33.201 --> 01:35:34.110
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2074
01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.950
<v Speaker 6>but how could you not but the um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

2075
01:35:37.100 --> 01:35:41.180
<v Speaker 6>but frankly that the simplicity of it is</v>
<v Speaker 6>so appealing.</v>

2076
01:35:41.181 --> 01:35:42.530
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>

2077
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:44.240
<v Speaker 6>it's fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2078
01:35:44.241 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 6>Versus setting everything up and plus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2079
01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.490
<v Speaker 6>you get to a point where a modern </v>
<v Speaker 6>compound bow,</v>

2080
01:35:49.491 --> 01:35:52.250
<v Speaker 6>if you practice a lot meaning for years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>

2081
01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.113
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll get to 90 yards to where you are </v>

2082
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:58.650
<v Speaker 6>professional day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are going to complain and I don't</v>

2083
01:35:58.651 --> 01:35:59.484
<v Speaker 6>know,</v>

2084
01:35:59.730 --> 01:36:00.563
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really that ethical for most </v>

2085
01:36:02.521 --> 01:36:03.354
<v Speaker 2>people to shoot at 90 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is for a guy like John Dudley or </v>

2086
01:36:05.851 --> 01:36:08.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy like cameron hanes because they do</v>

2087
01:36:08.131 --> 01:36:09.080
<v Speaker 2>it all day</v>

2088
01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:09.993
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grammy is a very technically proficient </v>

2089
01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.430
<v Speaker 4>shooter in anything that he shoots him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He won't say it,</v>

2090
01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:18.940
<v Speaker 4>but we used to sit in the ski area </v>
<v Speaker 4>parking lot,</v>

2091
01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:24.000
<v Speaker 4>Greyhawk parking lot and 106 yards is as</v>
<v Speaker 4>far as my adjustable site would go on my</v>

2092
01:36:26.291 --> 01:36:27.124
<v Speaker 4>bow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he would stand there and he could </v>

2093
01:36:28.451 --> 01:36:29.284
<v Speaker 4>shoot a lot further.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I mean the groups that he would put </v>

2094
01:36:31.061 --> 01:36:36.061
<v Speaker 4>in at 106 yards were a maze because he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>got that mind to do it so he can shoot,</v>

2095
01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:38.150
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2096
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:39.423
<v Speaker 6>But the thing is is that after awhile </v>
<v Speaker 6>you get to the point where I don't want </v>

2097
01:36:43.391 --> 01:36:48.330
<v Speaker 6>to shoot something at 50 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I want to shoot my next elk at 15 years.</v>

2098
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:51.340
<v Speaker 6>So you know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I think that's largely it.</v>

2099
01:36:51.341 --> 01:36:52.174
<v Speaker 6>And I think without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the past three years I've become way </v>

2100
01:36:55.271 --> 01:36:56.980
<v Speaker 6>better hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We have been know both.</v>

2101
01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:00.790
<v Speaker 6>I mean cows killed bubble both years </v>
<v Speaker 6>with his trad.</v>

2102
01:37:00.850 --> 01:37:04.540
<v Speaker 6>I missed a nice bowl two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's just hard,</v>

2103
01:37:04.990 --> 01:37:05.823
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if nothing else you're going to get </v>

2104
01:37:07.001 --> 01:37:10.330
<v Speaker 6>way better at hunting in the sense that </v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going to hunt more because you're</v>

2105
01:37:10.331 --> 01:37:12.640
<v Speaker 6>not going to kill shit at first.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2106
01:37:12.641 --> 01:37:14.290
<v Speaker 6>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>being,</v>

2107
01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:15.813
<v Speaker 6>having to go from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's just say 80 is a Max yard and I </v>

2108
01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:19.630
<v Speaker 6>don't want to get into the argument </v>
<v Speaker 6>about distance,</v>

2109
01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:21.050
<v Speaker 6>but let's just say that was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2110
01:37:21.060 --> 01:37:24.430
<v Speaker 6>your Max Max on a perfect situation with</v>
<v Speaker 6>the compound,</v>

2111
01:37:24.431 --> 01:37:28.870
<v Speaker 6>with a compound bow down to say 25 or 30</v>
<v Speaker 6>yards.</v>

2112
01:37:29.230 --> 01:37:30.910
<v Speaker 6>It,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's interesting.</v>

2113
01:37:30.911 --> 01:37:34.300
<v Speaker 6>It just makes you in your head just so </v>
<v Speaker 6>much more.</v>

2114
01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:36.700
<v Speaker 6>You have to try so much harder.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2115
01:37:36.701 --> 01:37:39.640
<v Speaker 6>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just people that experience,</v>

2116
01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:44.790
<v Speaker 2>I have no desire whatsoever to hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're a lifelong vegetarian,</v>

2117
01:37:44.971 --> 01:37:48.660
<v Speaker 2>you're never going to eat me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go shoot a bone Arrow at a target.</v>

2118
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:53.040
<v Speaker 2>It is so relaxing and some weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>meditative way.</v>

2119
01:37:53.041 --> 01:37:56.220
<v Speaker 2>It cleanses your mind in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zen</v>

2120
01:37:56.220 --> 01:37:57.053
<v Speaker 5>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2121
01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.190
<v Speaker 6>It's like fly fish and kind of same </v>
<v Speaker 6>thing.</v>

2122
01:37:59.191 --> 01:38:01.620
<v Speaker 6>It's like you're not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2123
01:38:01.621 --> 01:38:02.454
<v Speaker 6>you have to concentrate,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but at the same time it's like taking a </v>

2124
01:38:04.441 --> 01:38:06.570
<v Speaker 6>nap or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You go shoot for 20 minutes,</v>

2125
01:38:06.571 --> 01:38:07.680
<v Speaker 6>30 minutes and you're done.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're like,</v>

2126
01:38:07.681 --> 01:38:09.270
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what was I thinking about before?</v>

2127
01:38:09.710 --> 01:38:10.321
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2128
01:38:10.321 --> 01:38:11.154
<v Speaker 5>I love to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I've got like a business issue I'm </v>

2129
01:38:12.781 --> 01:38:16.140
<v Speaker 5>dealing with or something I'm trying to </v>
<v Speaker 5>like sort out in my mind.</v>

2130
01:38:16.141 --> 01:38:19.090
<v Speaker 5>I just go out in my yard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got a big rubber elk out there,</v>

2131
01:38:19.150 --> 01:38:19.983
<v Speaker 5>85 yards and they'll just start shooting</v>
<v Speaker 5>that sucker and you see you don't think </v>

2132
01:38:22.651 --> 01:38:25.680
<v Speaker 5>about nothing but that shot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just sent her that pen.</v>

2133
01:38:25.681 --> 01:38:27.780
<v Speaker 5>Try to stay calm,</v>
<v Speaker 5>relax your hand,</v>

2134
01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:31.140
<v Speaker 5>let the Bogo off and there's no room for</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything else.</v>

2135
01:38:31.141 --> 01:38:33.090
<v Speaker 5>And then in its activities.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2136
01:38:33.091 --> 01:38:33.924
<v Speaker 5>and you walk up there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you pull your arrows that you walked </v>

2137
01:38:35.701 --> 01:38:38.130
<v Speaker 5>back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're concentrating the whole process.</v>

2138
01:38:38.131 --> 01:38:38.964
<v Speaker 5>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's cleansing and some sort of </v>

2139
01:38:40.441 --> 01:38:43.140
<v Speaker 5>a weird way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm not a traditional bows shooter,</v>

2140
01:38:43.141 --> 01:38:46.710
<v Speaker 5>but I would imagine that was accentuated</v>
<v Speaker 5>even further because a,</v>

2141
01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:51.540
<v Speaker 5>it's even more like instinctive that you</v>
<v Speaker 5>have that involved as well.</v>

2142
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:52.553
<v Speaker 5>So like instead of using a site,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're sort of like calculating in your </v>

2143
01:38:56.101 --> 01:38:58.620
<v Speaker 5>mind the drop of the Arrow over distance</v>

2144
01:38:59.090 --> 01:38:59.923
<v Speaker 6>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it can be more frustrating to way </v>

2145
01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.310
<v Speaker 6>more with the compound out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

2146
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:04.183
<v Speaker 6>with the recurve.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've gone out and shot two arrows and I </v>

2147
01:39:05.871 --> 01:39:07.010
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>fuck this.</v>

2148
01:39:07.011 --> 01:39:08.120
<v Speaker 6>I'm done.</v>

2149
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ken and I are all,</v>

2150
01:39:14.281 --> 01:39:16.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our uh,</v>

2151
01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:17.573
<v Speaker 1>our first accountant gallery retired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we all went out and had some </v>

2152
01:39:19.711 --> 01:39:22.430
<v Speaker 1>beers with her and I was a little fuzzy </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next morning.</v>

2153
01:39:22.460 --> 01:39:24.330
<v Speaker 1>I forgot my tags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2154
01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:25.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2155
01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to call for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Canada.</v>

2156
01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:32.720
<v Speaker 1>And we took off into the woods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Bolin within 20 minutes.</v>

2157
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have a shot at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh,</v>

2158
01:39:34.921 --> 01:39:37.700
<v Speaker 1>this is a great day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ended up calling in three mobile,</v>

2159
01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.420
<v Speaker 1>three more bowls that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the bowl that Kenton got a shot at,</v>

2160
01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:43.883
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have shot four times before it </v>

2161
01:39:48.540 --> 01:39:51.090
<v Speaker 1>ultimately came into recurve distance.</v>

2162
01:39:51.340 --> 01:39:52.870
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But it did come in.</v>

2163
01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:53.913
<v Speaker 6>It came,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was in four yards at one </v>

2164
01:39:55.661 --> 01:39:57.060
<v Speaker 6>point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>

2165
01:39:57.250 --> 01:39:57.940
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was this,</v>

2166
01:39:57.940 --> 01:39:58.773
<v Speaker 6>it was like this close.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's so crazy to have an animal that </v>

2167
01:40:01.121 --> 01:40:04.870
<v Speaker 6>big that close to you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was crazy and fed to cows point.</v>

2168
01:40:04.871 --> 01:40:07.360
<v Speaker 6>The beauty was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>was that it was hanging up out at,</v>

2169
01:40:07.650 --> 01:40:10.600
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>50 yards for five minutes and that would</v>

2170
01:40:10.601 --> 01:40:12.040
<v Speaker 6>have been the end of that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2171
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:14.710
<v Speaker 6>I would have not had that same </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience.</v>

2172
01:40:14.711 --> 01:40:19.711
<v Speaker 6>And then it comes up and to count what </v>
<v Speaker 6>it licked you basically write in cap and</v>

2173
01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:23.450
<v Speaker 6>looking through the Mesh in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 6>my cab.</v>

2174
01:40:24.230 --> 01:40:26.980
<v Speaker 6>It's saying it's coming straight towards</v>
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>

2175
01:40:26.981 --> 01:40:29.250
<v Speaker 6>but I kind of caught me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2176
01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:30.990
<v Speaker 6>to where I didn't have a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

2177
01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.730
<v Speaker 6>and then it went and looked and I missed</v>
<v Speaker 6>it out.</v>

2178
01:40:33.870 --> 01:40:35.840
<v Speaker 6>I'll never forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But um,</v>

2179
01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:38.830
<v Speaker 6>but it would have been over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The experience of having,</v>

2180
01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:42.880
<v Speaker 6>of having to get that close is really </v>
<v Speaker 6>cool.</v>

2181
01:40:43.260 --> 01:40:44.570
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>If like,</v>

2182
01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:45.633
<v Speaker 6>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it would have been done and we'd have </v>

2183
01:40:46.571 --> 01:40:47.920
<v Speaker 6>been packing it on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would have been cool,</v>

2184
01:40:47.921 --> 01:40:48.754
<v Speaker 6>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that would have been incredible to </v>

2185
01:40:50.441 --> 01:40:51.310
<v Speaker 6>shoot it there too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But,</v>

2186
01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:54.850
<v Speaker 6>but just to be that close and visceral </v>
<v Speaker 6>and it's like,</v>

2187
01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.480
<v Speaker 6>holy smokes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean this thing is here.</v>

2188
01:40:59.080 --> 01:40:59.590
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2189
01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:00.423
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things that um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I talked about with Jason Harrington </v>

2190
01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:05.434
<v Speaker 5>from we were talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>difference between like mountaineering </v>

2191
01:41:07.871 --> 01:41:11.680
<v Speaker 5>and hunting and it's like all these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things and hiking and hunting.</v>

2192
01:41:11.681 --> 01:41:14.860
<v Speaker 5>It's like all these things are beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're amazing.</v>

2193
01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:15.873
<v Speaker 5>But then add the add to that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this experience of this really intense </v>

2194
01:41:20.321 --> 01:41:23.740
<v Speaker 5>moment with a wild animal where you have</v>
<v Speaker 5>to execute something,</v>

2195
01:41:23.741 --> 01:41:25.750
<v Speaker 5>you have to execute a shot and you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

2196
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:28.000
<v Speaker 5>Everything has to come together and has </v>
<v Speaker 5>to come together perfectly.</v>

2197
01:41:28.001 --> 01:41:30.880
<v Speaker 5>And that is what makes this so </v>
<v Speaker 5>addictive.</v>

2198
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:32.343
<v Speaker 5>And that's something that man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I try to relay that to people and I try </v>

2199
01:41:35.771 --> 01:41:38.650
<v Speaker 5>to explain it but I just feel like my </v>
<v Speaker 5>words aren't adequate.</v>

2200
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:41.710
<v Speaker 5>I feel like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything I always say to describe it,</v>

2201
01:41:41.711 --> 01:41:42.544
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I'm just rambling and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>not going to work because you have to </v>

2202
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:47.800
<v Speaker 5>kind of have to see it to understand.</v>

2203
01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.850
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean there's very little reference,</v>

2204
01:41:49.851 --> 01:41:51.110
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what you're talking about.</v>

2205
01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:51.921
<v Speaker 6>Like you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>

2206
01:41:51.921 --> 01:41:52.671
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2207
01:41:52.671 --> 01:41:53.504
<v Speaker 6>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2208
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:55.470
<v Speaker 6>skiing a perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2209
01:41:55.730 --> 01:41:57.260
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>50 degrees,</v>

2210
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:58.280
<v Speaker 6>powder line,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2211
01:41:58.281 --> 01:41:59.680
<v Speaker 6>Or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>something kind of,</v>

2212
01:41:59.730 --> 01:42:01.130
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>heavy with consequence.</v>

2213
01:42:01.131 --> 01:42:05.860
<v Speaker 6>But it's totally different than that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like it's,</v>

2214
01:42:06.230 --> 01:42:08.190
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know how else to describe it.</v>

2215
01:42:08.250 --> 01:42:09.083
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's certain words like there's no </v>

2216
01:42:09.541 --> 01:42:11.630
<v Speaker 5>words for a giant mushroom trip,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2217
01:42:11.631 --> 01:42:12.464
<v Speaker 5>like I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've tried to talk to people who've </v>

2218
01:42:13.261 --> 01:42:14.071
<v Speaker 5>never done anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2219
01:42:14.071 --> 01:42:15.570
<v Speaker 5>what's it like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see things,</v>

2220
01:42:15.690 --> 01:42:17.550
<v Speaker 5>you see pretty colors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is it really worth it?</v>

2221
01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.080
<v Speaker 5>Like you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2222
01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:21.750
<v Speaker 5>you just got to take enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2223
01:42:21.751 --> 01:42:22.584
<v Speaker 5>you can definitely see colors.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I mean I'm just saying those words </v>

2224
01:42:25.951 --> 01:42:26.670
<v Speaker 5>to beat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then,</v>

2225
01:42:26.670 --> 01:42:28.380
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you talked to somebody about it and then</v>

2226
01:42:28.381 --> 01:42:29.730
<v Speaker 5>like a year later they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

2227
01:42:29.731 --> 01:42:31.440
<v Speaker 5>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whoa.</v>

2228
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:32.303
<v Speaker 5>Like a buddy of mine recently just did </v>
<v Speaker 5>DMT and he had talked about it for a </v>

2229
01:42:35.671 --> 01:42:37.220
<v Speaker 5>long time and they finally did it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then he just,</v>

2230
01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:38.610
<v Speaker 5>he sent me a text message.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2231
01:42:38.611 --> 01:42:39.570
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm at the elves.</v>

2232
01:42:40.270 --> 01:42:41.103
<v Speaker 5>Was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

2233
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.960
<v Speaker 5>trip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2234
01:42:42.961 --> 01:42:43.261
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

2235
01:42:43.261 --> 01:42:44.094
<v Speaker 5>He texted me after it was over because </v>
<v Speaker 5>he had been thinking about doing it </v>

2236
01:42:46.831 --> 01:42:48.780
<v Speaker 5>forever and then it's one of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>things,</v>

2237
01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:51.000
<v Speaker 5>unless you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever I say,</v>

2238
01:42:51.240 --> 01:42:54.090
<v Speaker 5>the way the words that I'm using to </v>
<v Speaker 5>describe their just not going to work.</v>

2239
01:42:54.330 --> 01:42:56.830
<v Speaker 5>I think that's the case with so many </v>
<v Speaker 5>experiences in life,</v>

2240
01:42:56.831 --> 01:42:57.664
<v Speaker 5>like try to describe being in love to </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone who's never been in a </v>

2241
01:42:59.341 --> 01:43:00.500
<v Speaker 5>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2242
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:01.673
<v Speaker 5>there's no way you could never do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can never explain the love of your </v>

2243
01:43:03.961 --> 01:43:05.400
<v Speaker 5>children to someone who doesn't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>kids.</v>

2244
01:43:05.450 --> 01:43:07.440
<v Speaker 5>Who's the dog?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2245
01:43:09.440 --> 01:43:11.070
<v Speaker 5>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>figure it out.</v>

2246
01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:13.353
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think certain intense experiences </v>

2247
01:43:15.271 --> 01:43:16.104
<v Speaker 5>in life like hunting or he just even </v>
<v Speaker 5>mean we even forget the hunting mean </v>

2248
01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:20.693
<v Speaker 5>just being in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like attempting to hunt an animal is </v>

2249
01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:26.160
<v Speaker 5>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost psychedelic experience.</v>

2250
01:43:26.410 --> 01:43:28.530
<v Speaker 5>It's one of the things that I described </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

2251
01:43:28.770 --> 01:43:29.603
<v Speaker 5>the first trip that we went to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the Missouri breaks when I shot that </v>

2252
01:43:32.491 --> 01:43:35.130
<v Speaker 5>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I locked eyes with that animal,</v>

2253
01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:39.090
<v Speaker 5>the fruit for the first time and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting on a pack,</v>

2254
01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:40.313
<v Speaker 5>a looking down the scope of this rifle </v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was looking at this animal and </v>

2255
01:43:44.101 --> 01:43:47.150
<v Speaker 5>then I look at this animal through this </v>
<v Speaker 5>rifle scope and he's looking at me.</v>

2256
01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:47.993
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is a weird life form that's living </v>

2257
01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:52.783
<v Speaker 5>in this very barren and desolate place </v>
<v Speaker 5>where there's no people for miles and </v>

2258
01:43:58.221 --> 01:44:02.060
<v Speaker 5>I'm locking eyes with this thing and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>was oddly psychedelic.</v>

2259
01:44:02.061 --> 01:44:02.894
<v Speaker 5>It was oddly like paradigm shifting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the moment was so intense and </v>

2260
01:44:06.891 --> 01:44:08.120
<v Speaker 5>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

2261
01:44:08.121 --> 01:44:09.620
<v Speaker 5>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't expect this.</v>

2262
01:44:09.621 --> 01:44:11.120
<v Speaker 5>Like this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is like.</v>

2263
01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:12.173
<v Speaker 5>I mean kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I'm feeling like because this </v>

2264
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:15.764
<v Speaker 5>thing is looking at us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm feeling that this thing is thinking </v>

2265
01:44:17.870 --> 01:44:20.420
<v Speaker 5>like what are you and what are you doing</v>
<v Speaker 5>it?</v>

2266
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:23.240
<v Speaker 5>We probably never seen a person before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What are you,</v>

2267
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:25.220
<v Speaker 5>what are you doing here and should I be </v>
<v Speaker 5>worried</v>

2268
01:44:25.250 --> 01:44:26.110
<v Speaker 1>about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2269
01:44:26.111 --> 01:44:27.450
<v Speaker 1>He's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't here yesterday.</v>

2270
01:44:27.451 --> 01:44:28.284
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

2271
01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:29.790
<v Speaker 5>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>

2272
01:44:29.800 --> 01:44:34.650
<v Speaker 5>he's always seen is like baseball hat </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then the metal barrel of a rifle and</v>

2273
01:44:34.651 --> 01:44:35.484
<v Speaker 5>he's not seeing much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He just seeing us resting over the top </v>

2274
01:44:37.471 --> 01:44:39.000
<v Speaker 5>of a ridge looking down on him and he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2275
01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:40.950
<v Speaker 5>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>

2276
01:44:41.070 --> 01:44:45.270
<v Speaker 5>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's really weird intense experience.</v>

2277
01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:47.040
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the,</v>

2278
01:44:47.670 --> 01:44:48.540
<v Speaker 5>because</v>

2279
01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:52.300
<v Speaker 1>you do look at things in a much </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way and,</v>

2280
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:53.183
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the point of talking about all </v>

2281
01:44:56.370 --> 01:44:57.203
<v Speaker 1>this public land stuff is I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do feel like people who hunt and fish </v>

2282
01:45:01.430 --> 01:45:02.263
<v Speaker 1>carry a big load of this burden rent </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the taxes that we pay that or </v>

2283
01:45:06.660 --> 01:45:08.570
<v Speaker 1>taxes that if you don't hunt or fish you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't pay them.</v>

2284
01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:09.673
<v Speaker 5>So we've highlighted that on the show.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The actual amount of it we've showed </v>

2285
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:15.770
<v Speaker 5>from the rocky mountain elk foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>their instagram page,</v>

2286
01:45:15.771 --> 01:45:16.604
<v Speaker 5>they have a really good instagram page </v>
<v Speaker 5>that has a bunch of different examples </v>

2287
01:45:19.281 --> 01:45:20.114
<v Speaker 5>of different states of the sheer volume </v>
<v Speaker 5>of money that comes in because directly </v>

2288
01:45:25.100 --> 01:45:28.190
<v Speaker 5>because of hunting and fishing and it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>staggering.</v>

2289
01:45:28.191 --> 01:45:32.420
<v Speaker 5>It's in the billions and is by far above</v>
<v Speaker 5>and beyond anything else.</v>

2290
01:45:32.480 --> 01:45:33.313
<v Speaker 5>By far,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the the largest amount of conservation </v>

2291
01:45:36.501 --> 01:45:39.290
<v Speaker 5>money that comes into this country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the largest by far.</v>

2292
01:45:39.380 --> 01:45:42.980
<v Speaker 5>It is so fishermen,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing even close.</v>

2293
01:45:42.981 --> 01:45:45.650
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing when you think about it </v>
<v Speaker 5>that way in that sense.</v>

2294
01:45:45.651 --> 01:45:46.484
<v Speaker 5>This system that we have here with </v>
<v Speaker 5>public land and with using these tax </v>

2295
01:45:49.851 --> 01:45:50.684
<v Speaker 5>dollars to pay for,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for all the wildlife biologists to pay </v>

2296
01:45:53.481 --> 01:45:56.840
<v Speaker 5>for the fish and game to pay for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>population management.</v>

2297
01:45:56.841 --> 01:45:58.700
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's an amazing system,</v>

2298
01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but if you're a hiker that your peak </v>
<v Speaker 1>bagger,</v>

2299
01:46:01.961 --> 01:46:02.794
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're finding names on the map and </v>

2300
01:46:04.301 --> 01:46:05.850
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to hike to this lake or I'm an</v>

2301
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.920
<v Speaker 1>hike to this peak European.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2302
01:46:07.930 --> 01:46:11.280
<v Speaker 1>We call them a peak bagger bagging piano</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag,</v>

2303
01:46:11.290 --> 01:46:12.790
<v Speaker 1>a peak two peaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you been to?</v>

2304
01:46:12.870 --> 01:46:13.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2305
01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:14.613
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peek a big sounds like in that </v>

2306
01:46:17.260 --> 01:46:18.093
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2307
01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Boulder?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2308
01:46:19.130 --> 01:46:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Fourteeners and bag and a lot of peaks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people fall off those peaks to man.</v>

2309
01:46:24.210 --> 01:46:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get stuck up there.</v>

2310
01:46:26.930 --> 01:46:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2311
01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:29.883
<v Speaker 1>you are taking a trail on established </v>
<v Speaker 1>trail and you're covering miles and </v>

2312
01:46:33.281 --> 01:46:34.114
<v Speaker 1>you're getting to your goal and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're snapping a picture or spending </v>

2313
01:46:38.441 --> 01:46:39.274
<v Speaker 1>the night and then you're coming back on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that trail or maybe it's a different </v>

2314
01:46:41.681 --> 01:46:43.810
<v Speaker 1>trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas one hunter,</v>

2315
01:46:44.120 --> 01:46:44.953
<v Speaker 5>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>as soon as you step away from the truck </v>

2316
01:46:48.710 --> 01:46:49.543
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

2317
01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.083
<v Speaker 1>or out the trail head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are plotting your own course so </v>

2318
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:59.830
<v Speaker 1>you're making your own moves and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a totally different experience.</v>

2319
01:47:00.091 --> 01:47:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Everything means something different to </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2320
01:47:02.071 --> 01:47:02.904
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at it in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to interpret different </v>

2321
01:47:05.461 --> 01:47:09.000
<v Speaker 1>signs and your base note path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:47:09.001 --> 01:47:09.740
<v Speaker 1>And your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2323
01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:13.280
<v Speaker 1>your choices are pretty much limitless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely limitless.</v>

2324
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:14.213
<v Speaker 1>Like when you leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as you get off the trail you're </v>

2325
01:47:17.311 --> 01:47:18.630
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2326
01:47:18.631 --> 01:47:20.820
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you hear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear something or you see something,</v>

2327
01:47:20.821 --> 01:47:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you smell something and that begins your</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

2328
01:47:22.921 --> 01:47:24.240
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might,</v>

2329
01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:27.920
<v Speaker 1>you might not leave a 100 yards that day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might cover,</v>

2330
01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be a heavy,</v>

2331
01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:31.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight mile,</v>

2332
01:47:31.140 --> 01:47:32.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000</v>

2333
01:47:32.521 --> 01:47:34.260
<v Speaker 1>foot day you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

2334
01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:35.633
<v Speaker 1>I don't ask the craziest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to be prepared for </v>

2335
01:47:37.620 --> 01:47:38.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2336
01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get people who are like,</v>

2337
01:47:40.351 --> 01:47:41.184
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there aren't any wolves here anymore </v>

2338
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:45.900
<v Speaker 1>because in Idaho wolves were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see them a lot,</v>

2339
01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:50.160
<v Speaker 1>especially in Ketchum area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lohmann area there wolves that,</v>

2340
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:52.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're smart critters,</v>

2341
01:47:52.171 --> 01:47:55.200
<v Speaker 1>they know that they knew that nobody was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to shoot at them.</v>

2342
01:47:55.890 --> 01:47:58.740
<v Speaker 1>And so they were a fairly common </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurrence to see.</v>

2343
01:47:58.950 --> 01:47:59.783
<v Speaker 1>And then once the season opened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once they let people go out and they </v>

2344
01:48:02.851 --> 01:48:04.700
<v Speaker 1>issued tags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2345
01:48:04.890 --> 01:48:08.220
<v Speaker 1>they picked it up really quick and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't just see them hanging out next to</v>

2346
01:48:08.221 --> 01:48:09.600
<v Speaker 1>the road and people said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2347
01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.740
<v Speaker 1>none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds killed all the walls.</v>

2348
01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:12.563
<v Speaker 1>But oddly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunters are reporting Wolf's </v>

2349
01:48:14.181 --> 01:48:15.740
<v Speaker 1>sightings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2350
01:48:15.810 --> 01:48:16.643
<v Speaker 1>I saw that.</v>

2351
01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:18.280
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're not killing all the wolves.</v>

2352
01:48:18.281 --> 01:48:19.840
<v Speaker 5>They're killing a pretty small number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

2353
01:48:21.690 --> 01:48:22.523
<v Speaker 1>Job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As hunters,</v>

2354
01:48:22.530 --> 01:48:23.640
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not,</v>

2355
01:48:23.670 --> 01:48:24.503
<v Speaker 1>we're not getting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting the numbers that were supposed </v>

2356
01:48:25.531 --> 01:48:25.610
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2357
01:48:25.610 --> 01:48:27.470
<v Speaker 5>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do they,</v>

2358
01:48:27.471 --> 01:48:30.290
<v Speaker 5>are they hiring professional wolf </v>
<v Speaker 5>killers to,</v>

2359
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:33.950
<v Speaker 5>to go after a wolves like they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>in California to go after cougars?</v>

2360
01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:37.130
<v Speaker 5>Since they killed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>since they stopped the hunting season on</v>

2361
01:48:37.131 --> 01:48:37.964
<v Speaker 5>mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they haven't stopped killing mountain </v>

2362
01:48:39.111 --> 01:48:39.944
<v Speaker 5>lions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's something people don't </v>

2363
01:48:40.251 --> 01:48:41.084
<v Speaker 5>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there was a depredation order on a </v>

2364
01:48:42.741 --> 01:48:43.574
<v Speaker 5>mountain lion up in the Malibu mountains</v>
<v Speaker 5>that had killed 11 Alpaca and a goat in </v>

2365
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.480
<v Speaker 5>one sitting this big fucker just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they know the,</v>

2366
01:48:52.481 --> 01:48:55.460
<v Speaker 5>the lion too because it's tagged,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it has a collar on it.</v>

2367
01:48:55.790 --> 01:48:58.370
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this fucker just found an Alpaca farm.</v>

2368
01:48:58.371 --> 01:49:01.040
<v Speaker 5>I just went to town,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just had a glory killing spree.</v>

2369
01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:05.390
<v Speaker 5>So in California they can't know no </v>
<v Speaker 5>mountain lion hunting whatsoever,</v>

2370
01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:09.800
<v Speaker 5>but they're everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 5>especially in rural areas.</v>

2371
01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:12.240
<v Speaker 5>There's a place called to hone ranch </v>
<v Speaker 5>where that bolt came from.</v>

2372
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:13.223
<v Speaker 5>See Front,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's one lake that they have like a </v>

2373
01:49:15.651 --> 01:49:17.660
<v Speaker 5>pond they have out there and they have </v>
<v Speaker 5>trail cam up.</v>

2374
01:49:17.690 --> 01:49:21.200
<v Speaker 5>They've got 17 different mountain lions </v>
<v Speaker 5>on trail cam.</v>

2375
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're about meeting people fairly,</v>

2376
01:49:23.501 --> 01:49:24.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly often out here,</v>

2377
01:49:24.581 --> 01:49:24.880
<v Speaker 1>huh?</v>

2378
01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.631
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it can,</v>

2379
01:49:25.631 --> 01:49:26.410
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2380
01:49:26.410 --> 01:49:27.243
<v Speaker 5>it's a lot of it's joggers or bikers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people on trail bikes because they </v>

2381
01:49:31.481 --> 01:49:33.010
<v Speaker 5>think that trying to get away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2382
01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.033
<v Speaker 5>And other things.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's almost like a cat with a ball of </v>

2383
01:49:35.501 --> 01:49:36.790
<v Speaker 5>yarn.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just can't help themselves.</v>

2384
01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:37.653
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Or flight risk.</v>

2385
01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:39.580
<v Speaker 5>Someone's running the like pitch were </v>
<v Speaker 5>you gone.</v>

2386
01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:41.183
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is it's like 100 or are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something different than your </v>

2387
01:49:47.711 --> 01:49:49.650
<v Speaker 1>typical recreate are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2388
01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:50.673
<v Speaker 1>we're not sticking to a game plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like you're that different </v>

2389
01:49:54.071 --> 01:49:54.904
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different making Predator and prey </v>

2390
01:49:57.161 --> 01:49:57.994
<v Speaker 1>noises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2391
01:49:58.480 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2392
01:49:59.471 --> 01:50:00.304
<v Speaker 1>You're just doing things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think feel like I get a little </v>

2393
01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:03.933
<v Speaker 1>torque sometimes where people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well of course hunters are going to </v>

2394
01:50:06.131 --> 01:50:08.360
<v Speaker 1>say there's wolves out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know it's,</v>

2395
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:09.303
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is good information for biologists </v>

2396
01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:15.280
<v Speaker 1>because we're out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually our point in the woods is being</v>

2397
01:50:15.281 --> 01:50:16.360
<v Speaker 1>out there looking for animals.</v>

2398
01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:17.633
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why I wanted to have </v>

2399
01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.044
<v Speaker 2>you guys on is to really sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed this public land issue and </v>

2400
01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:27.140
<v Speaker 2>also to allow people to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's at stake and to give them options</v>

2401
01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:35.480
<v Speaker 2>to look into and to different resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they can check in on.</v>

2402
01:50:35.731 --> 01:50:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a back country hunters and anglers.</v>

2403
01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:40.870
<v Speaker 2>A Bha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2404
01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Back Balcony,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back country hunters and anglers.</v>

2405
01:50:43.771 --> 01:50:44.604
<v Speaker 2>I can't say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My mouth starts shutting down after two </v>

2406
01:50:46.591 --> 01:50:50.420
<v Speaker 2>hours these days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they're doing is a amazing like</v>

2407
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:54.390
<v Speaker 2>highlighting like what this is and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>important this is and what are the other</v>

2408
01:50:54.391 --> 01:50:56.430
<v Speaker 2>things that people could do if they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look into this stuff.</v>

2409
01:50:56.610 --> 01:50:57.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Bha is big,</v>

2410
01:50:57.841 --> 01:50:58.674
<v Speaker 1>loud voice and I think they one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best groups out there right now to </v>

2411
01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:08.180
<v Speaker 1>really just raise awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on public lands and access issues.</v>

2412
01:51:08.970 --> 01:51:11.820
<v Speaker 1>Teddy Roosevelt conservation partnership</v>
<v Speaker 1>does a phenomenal.</v>

2413
01:51:11.821 --> 01:51:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2414
01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:13.293
<v Speaker 2>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A country hunters and National Wildlife </v>

2415
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.781
<v Speaker 2>Federation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

2416
01:51:16.781 --> 01:51:17.614
<v Speaker 2>You read that there are two folks if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to buy that public land owner tee </v>

2417
01:51:20.831 --> 01:51:21.760
<v Speaker 2>shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have it there</v>

2418
01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:23.490
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2419
01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:28.500
<v Speaker 1>so what the main issue is in Kenton I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talked about,</v>

2420
01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:30.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have an incredible platform here,</v>

2421
01:51:30.841 --> 01:51:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Joanne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't want to waste it.</v>

2422
01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:36.360
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a nonpartisan issue.</v>

2423
01:51:37.170 --> 01:51:40.380
<v Speaker 1>If you don't like 100 and $800 or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anglers,</v>

2424
01:51:41.370 --> 01:51:45.330
<v Speaker 1>that is still your land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you never leave downtown La,</v>

2425
01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:50.460
<v Speaker 1>all this public land contributes to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of life through clean air,</v>

2426
01:51:50.461 --> 01:51:51.294
<v Speaker 1>clean water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just knowing that it's there should be </v>

2427
01:51:54.180 --> 01:51:55.013
<v Speaker 1>it something that is warm and cozy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>you because it is your birthright as an </v>

2428
01:52:00.571 --> 01:52:01.404
<v Speaker 1>American</v>

2429
01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:05.130
<v Speaker 2>in this country where 95 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people you meet,</v>

2430
01:52:05.170 --> 01:52:07.380
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might even be higher than that.</v>

2431
01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:11.550
<v Speaker 2>It's depending upon it and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

2432
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:14.910
<v Speaker 2>so many discussions these days about </v>
<v Speaker 2>where your food comes from.</v>

2433
01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:19.230
<v Speaker 2>There's no better way to find out where </v>
<v Speaker 2>your food comes from then to actually go</v>

2434
01:52:19.231 --> 01:52:20.064
<v Speaker 2>out and get it.</v>

2435
01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2436
01:52:21.590 --> 01:52:22.670
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

2437
01:52:22.671 --> 01:52:27.500
<v Speaker 1>if if you're buying beef or lamb off off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grocery store shelf,</v>

2438
01:52:28.130 --> 01:52:29.960
<v Speaker 1>those grazing permits that we talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

2439
01:52:30.170 --> 01:52:31.003
<v Speaker 1>that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that happens on federally </v>

2440
01:52:32.781 --> 01:52:33.614
<v Speaker 1>managed lands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Blm or forest service </v>

2441
01:52:37.191 --> 01:52:38.024
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is this is nonpartisan </v>

2442
01:52:41.060 --> 01:52:43.280
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that ticked me off</v>

2443
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:46.130
<v Speaker 1>about old Jason Chavez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hr six,</v>

2444
01:52:46.130 --> 01:52:47.210
<v Speaker 6>21 and said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey,</v>

2445
01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:50.060
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this started under Obama,</v>

2446
01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:55.550
<v Speaker 6>Clinton or Clinton Clinton took </v>
<v Speaker 6>designated these lands is useless.</v>

2447
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.050
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who cares?</v>

2448
01:52:57.440 --> 01:52:59.030
<v Speaker 6>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was Clinton,</v>

2449
01:52:59.031 --> 01:52:59.930
<v Speaker 6>Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 6>trump,</v>

2450
01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:01.340
<v Speaker 6>that doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who Cares?</v>

2451
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:02.850
<v Speaker 6>You're taking the Lexan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who Cares?</v>

2452
01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:05.950
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>point to back.</v>

2453
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.823
<v Speaker 6>It's a nonpartisan issue and I think a </v>
<v Speaker 6>lot of times people would like you to </v>

2454
01:53:10.131 --> 01:53:10.851
<v Speaker 6>believe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2455
01:53:10.851 --> 01:53:14.480
<v Speaker 6>if you're a republican year against this</v>
<v Speaker 6>or if you're know pro,</v>

2456
01:53:14.481 --> 01:53:17.180
<v Speaker 6>second amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can't vote for that and this,</v>

2457
01:53:17.240 --> 01:53:18.073
<v Speaker 6>that and the fact is is that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you have a Republican leader in your </v>

2458
01:53:22.881 --> 01:53:25.190
<v Speaker 6>area,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they can change their mind.</v>

2459
01:53:25.191 --> 01:53:26.750
<v Speaker 6>You need to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2460
01:53:26.751 --> 01:53:28.670
<v Speaker 6>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if that's the way you feel,</v>

2461
01:53:28.671 --> 01:53:29.504
<v Speaker 6>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you have to realize that you can't </v>

2462
01:53:31.661 --> 01:53:34.220
<v Speaker 6>have your cake and eat it too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't have to be one or the other.</v>

2463
01:53:34.250 --> 01:53:35.600
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean,</v>

2464
01:53:35.601 --> 01:53:36.434
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can be a conservative and still be </v>

2465
01:53:38.511 --> 01:53:39.910
<v Speaker 6>pro public lands,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2466
01:53:39.920 --> 01:53:40.753
<v Speaker 6>and you need to work and call and do </v>
<v Speaker 6>what you need to change them if they're </v>

2467
01:53:43.791 --> 01:53:44.680
<v Speaker 6>not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because if,</v>

2468
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.880
<v Speaker 6>once it's gone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's gone and use social</v>

2469
01:53:46.960 --> 01:53:51.070
<v Speaker 5>media because social media is an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 5>tool and that's what killed her six,</v>

2470
01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:51.913
<v Speaker 5>21.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was directly killed by social media </v>

2471
01:53:53.151 --> 01:53:56.140
<v Speaker 5>and he was killed quick who was killed a</v>
<v Speaker 5>couple of weeks,</v>

2472
01:53:56.560 --> 01:53:57.393
<v Speaker 5>you know the pressure that they faced </v>
<v Speaker 5>from guys like me posting it to one </v>

2473
01:54:00.161 --> 01:54:00.994
<v Speaker 5>point 8 million people on Instagram,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one and a half million people on </v>

2474
01:54:03.251 --> 01:54:06.940
<v Speaker 5>facebook say $3 million or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck it is on twitter.</v>

2475
01:54:06.941 --> 01:54:10.390
<v Speaker 5>Like all those people that add up and </v>
<v Speaker 5>then those people find out about it.</v>

2476
01:54:10.391 --> 01:54:13.210
<v Speaker 5>They jump in and they realize that this </v>
<v Speaker 5>is a.</v>

2477
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:14.103
<v Speaker 5>This is a really important issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a giant issue and Rinella always </v>

2478
01:54:18.401 --> 01:54:20.290
<v Speaker 5>points out that he's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

2479
01:54:20.291 --> 01:54:24.730
<v Speaker 5>Rinella wrote a great article about all </v>
<v Speaker 5>this and about how killing her six,</v>

2480
01:54:24.731 --> 01:54:29.080
<v Speaker 5>21 is just one battle in the overall war</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we're not.</v>

2481
01:54:29.081 --> 01:54:29.914
<v Speaker 5>There's no not out of the woods by any </v>
<v Speaker 5>stretch of the imagination and that </v>

2482
01:54:32.291 --> 01:54:36.100
<v Speaker 5>article is available right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you go to his twitter,</v>

01:54:36.101 --> 01:54:39.700
<v Speaker 5>it's on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's on a meat eater.com.</v>

2484
01:54:40.210 --> 01:54:41.200
<v Speaker 5>Is that where it is?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2485
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:42.310

2486
01:54:42.311 --> 01:54:43.660
<v Speaker 5>that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's one,</v>

2487
01:54:43.690 --> 01:54:47.950
<v Speaker 5>but there's one that I tweeted today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the one from January.</v>

2488
01:54:47.951 --> 01:54:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Twentieth is one that I tweeted today </v>
<v Speaker 5>that he just recently wrote and he calls</v>

2489
01:54:52.901 --> 01:54:54.880
<v Speaker 5>himself a political unit because he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2490
01:54:54.910 --> 01:54:55.750
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>

2491
01:54:55.930 --> 01:54:59.650

<v Speaker 5>land and the Democrats want to take away</v>

2492
01:54:59.651 --> 01:55:00.650
<v Speaker 5>your guns.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

2493
01:55:00.670 --> 01:55:02.450
<v Speaker 5>I don't know where the fuck to go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>

2494
01:55:02.590 --> 01:55:03.550
<v Speaker 5>In that sense,</v>

2495
01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:04.400
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not.</v>

2496
01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:07.910

<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2497
01:55:07.911 --> 01:55:10.010

<v Speaker 6>representatives are there to represent </v>
<v Speaker 6>your interests and this is the article.</v>

2501
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:18.343
<v Speaker 5>robber barons and the continued fight </v>
<v Speaker 5>for our public lands and he just </v>

01:57:27.790 --> 01:57:29.410
<v Speaker 5>what does it church Frank Church,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does it,</v>

2550
01:57:29.411 --> 01:57:31.570
<v Speaker 5>Frank Church,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Frank Church wilderness.</v>

2551
01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:32.553
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>imagine if you went up there and it's </v>

2552
01:57:33.190 --> 01:57:34.023
<v Speaker 5>fucking mall.</v>

2553
01:57:34.650 --> 01:57:35.483
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody chopped all the trees down and </v>

2554
01:57:37.570 --> 01:57:38.403
<v Speaker 4>we'll put up a gold cart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at the state planned </v>

2555
01:57:42.691 --> 01:57:43.524
<v Speaker 4>example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>read the state lands are there to make </v>

2556
01:57:44.881 --> 01:57:46.920
<v Speaker 4>money for the states.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like we said,</v>

2557
01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.290
<v Speaker 4>state gets in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sell those lands,</v>

2558
01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.270
<v Speaker 4>fire anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2559
01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:52.133
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just sucks all the money out of the </v>

2560
01:57:53.341 --> 01:57:54.174
<v Speaker 4>state and then the states literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>mandated not to have a negative balance </v>

2561
01:57:57.571 --> 01:57:59.670
<v Speaker 4>so that once that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>

2562
01:57:59.671 --> 01:58:02.460
<v Speaker 4>how are we going to make our money?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is Roosevelt so wise?</v>

2563
01:58:03.630 --> 01:58:04.463
<v Speaker 4>He had just panic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear of God put into him because he had </v>

2564
01:58:07.831 --> 01:58:10.050
<v Speaker 4>this realization that he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>

2565
01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:15.500
<v Speaker 4>the entire reason I am who I am today is</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I had this opportunity to go out</v>

2566
01:58:15.571 --> 01:58:19.110
<v Speaker 4>and chase animals and and if I saw </v>
<v Speaker 4>horizon line,</v>

2567
01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:21.390
<v Speaker 4>I could go over the top of it because </v>
<v Speaker 4>nobody owned it.</v>

2568
01:58:22.590 --> 01:58:24.510
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that made me who I am.</v>

2569
01:58:25.170 --> 01:58:27.720
<v Speaker 4>I got to try to make sure that this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>here for the next person.</v>

2570
01:58:28.620 --> 01:58:32.880
<v Speaker 5>People don't understand that in many </v>
<v Speaker 5>countries that's not really possible and</v>

2571
01:58:32.881 --> 01:58:33.714
<v Speaker 5>that's actually the story of Robin Hood.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Story of Robin Hood wasn't really about </v>

2572
01:58:38.251 --> 01:58:41.680
<v Speaker 5>stealing from the rich and stealing </v>
<v Speaker 5>their money and giving it to the poor.</v>

2573
01:58:41.890 --> 01:58:44.710
<v Speaker 5>It was about hunting lands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was the original.</v>

2574
01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:46.743
<v Speaker 5>The king did not let anyone hunt in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>kingdoms hunting lands and Robin Hood </v>

2575
01:58:51.370 --> 01:58:52.450
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck you.</v>

2576
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:53.583
<v Speaker 5>And he went out the air and he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>shooting deer and getting people food </v>

2577
01:58:55.811 --> 01:58:57.880
<v Speaker 5>because people were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that,</v>

2578
01:58:58.090 --> 01:59:01.240
<v Speaker 5>that is something that we can do here in</v>
<v Speaker 5>America that you can't.</v>

2579
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:02.103
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's one of the reasons why you get so </v>

2580
01:59:02.921 --> 01:59:03.754
<v Speaker 5>much hate mail from Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got a lot of hate mail from </v>

2581
01:59:05.621 --> 01:59:08.290
<v Speaker 5>places where they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>recreational hunting because to them,</v>

2582
01:59:08.291 --> 01:59:10.690
<v Speaker 5>and they don't even understand it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>they're eating steak,</v>

2583
01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:11.793
<v Speaker 5>they're eating steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like my wife got into an argument with </v>

2584
01:59:13.841 --> 01:59:16.300
<v Speaker 5>one of her friend's husbands were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

2585
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:17.890
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she was saying that,</v>

2586
01:59:17.891 --> 01:59:20.140
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was on a hunting trip and this guy was</v>

2587
01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:22.990
<v Speaker 5>eating a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>carving a steak,</v>

2588
01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:24.340
<v Speaker 5>literally are at dinner.</v>

2589
01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:25.031
<v Speaker 5>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2590
01:59:25.031 --> 01:59:26.980
<v Speaker 5>that's deplorable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's deplorable.</v>

2591
01:59:26.981 --> 01:59:28.120
<v Speaker 5>He hunts animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2592
01:59:28.121 --> 01:59:29.350
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2593
01:59:29.351 --> 01:59:30.250
<v Speaker 5>she.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she's like,</v>

2594
01:59:30.251 --> 01:59:32.050
<v Speaker 5>you're eating a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She's like,</v>

2595
01:59:32.051 --> 01:59:33.640
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these animals are farmed animals.</v>

2596
01:59:33.641 --> 01:59:34.210
<v Speaker 5>And they're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go,</v>

2597
01:59:34.210 --> 01:59:34.871
<v Speaker 5>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2598
01:59:34.871 --> 01:59:37.630
<v Speaker 5>don't you think that that animal lived </v>
<v Speaker 5>to horrific existence?</v>

2599
01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:38.613
<v Speaker 5>And then finally was killed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think that's better than someone </v>

2600
01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:41.764
<v Speaker 5>just out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're hiding behind a bush making cow </v>

2601
01:59:44.111 --> 01:59:44.944
<v Speaker 5>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And you blast and Arrow through the </v>

2602
01:59:45.731 --> 01:59:49.240
<v Speaker 5>heart of some wild beast and then take </v>
<v Speaker 5>that thing down off the mountain.</v>

2603
01:59:49.241 --> 01:59:51.310
<v Speaker 5>You have the experience,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have the food.</v>

2604
01:59:51.311 --> 01:59:54.550
<v Speaker 5>You also have this wild encounter with </v>
<v Speaker 5>this,</v>

2605
01:59:54.551 --> 01:59:55.384
<v Speaker 5>this magnificent beasts that you have </v>
<v Speaker 5>this connection to that every time you </v>

2606
01:59:58.961 --> 01:59:59.794
<v Speaker 5>eat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like every time I eat a steak off of </v>

2607
02:00:02.051 --> 02:00:02.884
<v Speaker 5>that elk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think about the experience of hunting </v>

2608
02:00:04.661 --> 02:00:06.280
<v Speaker 5>that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think about seeing it.</v>

2609
02:00:06.490 --> 02:00:09.310
<v Speaker 5>I think about cutting it up and carrying</v>
<v Speaker 5>it out of there.</v>

2610
02:00:09.311 --> 02:00:12.900
<v Speaker 5>I did the whole thing about it is all </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all connected.</v>

2611
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:15.640
<v Speaker 5>That loading it into the truck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hoisting it up.</v>

2612
02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:16.474
<v Speaker 5>Like the whole thing is like in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 5>every time I cut into the meat and </v>

2613
02:00:19.991 --> 02:00:24.310
<v Speaker 5>people at the end of the day are </v>
<v Speaker 5>genetically hardwired to do that.</v>

2614
02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:25.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's weird.</v>

2615
02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:26.943
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's weird when you tap into that file </v>

2616
02:00:28.690 --> 02:00:29.523
<v Speaker 5>and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't know about this file working </v>

2617
02:00:31.091 --> 02:00:31.980
<v Speaker 5>for it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

2618
02:00:32.170 --> 02:00:35.500
<v Speaker 5>Work Experience on public lands.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There is.</v>

2619
02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:36.993
<v Speaker 5>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We talk about this at length all the </v>

2620
02:00:39.401 --> 02:00:40.234
<v Speaker 5>time and Kenton's got this knicker </v>
<v Speaker 5>analogy and we're walking around shot </v>

2621
02:00:43.091 --> 02:00:43.924
<v Speaker 5>show and there's this European hunting </v>
<v Speaker 5>company down the road and he stopped me </v>

2622
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:48.630
<v Speaker 5>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey Kel.</v>

2623
02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:50.163
<v Speaker 5>It's like we lose all this land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is what we're going to be making </v>

2624
02:00:53.100 --> 02:00:56.370
<v Speaker 5>knickers fake hunting.</v>

2625
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:57.343
<v Speaker 5>I'm not gonna say there's fake hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's like a canned experience </v>

2626
02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:02.513
<v Speaker 5>hunting here and ones where they </v>
<v Speaker 5>released the pheasants out of the back </v>

2627
02:01:06.941 --> 02:01:10.930
<v Speaker 5>of a truck and that does happen folks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a thing called pheasant shoots,</v>

2628
02:01:11.140 --> 02:01:11.973
<v Speaker 5>European pheasant shoots and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally release these birds and the </v>

2629
02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:16.234
<v Speaker 5>birds fly away and guys stand there with</v>
<v Speaker 5>guns waiting for them to release from </v>

2630
02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:22.180
<v Speaker 5>the cage and shoot them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's how Dick Cheney shot his friend.</v>

2631
02:01:22.930 --> 02:01:25.600
<v Speaker 5>Remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Remember that story?</v>

2632
02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:26.553
<v Speaker 5>He shot his friend in the fucking face </v>
<v Speaker 5>and that was a canned hunt where they </v>

2633
02:01:30.521 --> 02:01:32.590
<v Speaker 5>just opened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They literally open a can.</v>

2634
02:01:32.591 --> 02:01:35.560
<v Speaker 5>The birds fly out and they wait and boom</v>
<v Speaker 5>and shoot them.</v>

2635
02:01:36.610 --> 02:01:40.130
<v Speaker 5>I mean the hunting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's honestly like being outside</v>

2636
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 6>of your,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your comfort zone.</v>

2637
02:01:41.991 --> 02:01:43.790
<v Speaker 6>That is it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fabien and,</v>

2638
02:01:43.791 --> 02:01:44.571
<v Speaker 6>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2639
02:01:44.571 --> 02:01:46.850
<v Speaker 6>and if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if that's not going to happen,</v>

2640
02:01:46.851 --> 02:01:47.750
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not interest</v>

2641
02:01:47.780 --> 02:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man,</v>

2642
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>but public hunting experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2643
02:01:51.211 --> 02:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>we're all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2644
02:01:53.330 --> 02:01:54.163
<v Speaker 1>that's where you follow the rules read </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody gets the same </v>

2645
02:01:56.931 --> 02:01:57.764
<v Speaker 1>experience on and on our side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are constantly like analyzing our </v>

2646
02:02:02.781 --> 02:02:03.614
<v Speaker 1>clothing and analyzing our days and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting to be totally truthful </v>

2647
02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life at firstline.</v>

2648
02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:11.923
<v Speaker 1>Pretty fricking good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get to spend a lot of days in the </v>

2649
02:02:13.911 --> 02:02:14.744
<v Speaker 1>woods way more than your average joe </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to and that's how we make stuff </v>

2650
02:02:20.091 --> 02:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>good and</v>

2651
02:02:22.380 --> 02:02:23.213
<v Speaker 5>well with the way you guys do it is you </v>
<v Speaker 5>have new pieces and then you give them </v>

2652
02:02:26.971 --> 02:02:30.460
<v Speaker 5>to like your representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like people that you guys have like w,</v>

2653
02:02:30.461 --> 02:02:31.294
<v Speaker 5>what do you guys call them?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ambassadors or something like that when </v>

2654
02:02:33.901 --> 02:02:34.680
<v Speaker 5>you call them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2655
02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:36.030
<v Speaker 5>team guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>team guys.</v>

2656
02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:39.300
<v Speaker 5>So you have a bunch of guys who I follow</v>
<v Speaker 5>on Instagram,</v>

2657
02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:43.230
<v Speaker 5>hardcore hunters who spend a giant chunk</v>
<v Speaker 5>of their life out in the woods.</v>

2658
02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.690
<v Speaker 5>Some are public,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some are not,</v>

2659
02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:47.313
<v Speaker 6>but the idea is to set,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to send them to people that use them in </v>

2660
02:02:49.330 --> 02:02:51.340
<v Speaker 6>tons of different environments like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2661
02:02:51.341 --> 02:02:56.170
<v Speaker 6>we hunted in a rocky so we know we've </v>
<v Speaker 6>got plenty of experience there,</v>

2662
02:02:56.171 --> 02:02:56.910
<v Speaker 6>but it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We'll,</v>

2663
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:58.980
<v Speaker 6>we'll send stay stuff to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2664
02:02:58.990 --> 02:03:03.580
<v Speaker 6>guys hunting in BC or guys hunting in ak</v>
<v Speaker 6>where it's raining all the time,</v>

2665
02:03:03.581 --> 02:03:05.170
<v Speaker 6>but that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the goal,</v>

2666
02:03:05.350 --> 02:03:06.280
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or where it's hot,</v>

2667
02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:07.353
<v Speaker 6>but being able to send stuff out and </v>
<v Speaker 6>have it used in these tons of different </v>

2668
02:03:10.481 --> 02:03:12.910
<v Speaker 6>environments allows us just to build </v>
<v Speaker 6>better stuff,</v>

2669
02:03:12.940 --> 02:03:14.020
<v Speaker 6>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2670
02:03:14.021 --> 02:03:14.440
<v Speaker 6>And it's</v>

2671
02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:15.273
<v Speaker 5>real trial and error thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Were you taking these super experienced </v>

2672
02:03:18.761 --> 02:03:20.950
<v Speaker 5>guys and when you said some guys are </v>
<v Speaker 5>public,</v>

2673
02:03:20.951 --> 02:03:21.784
<v Speaker 5>some guys are not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What you mean is some guys have public </v>

2674
02:03:23.321 --> 02:03:24.154
<v Speaker 5>profiles in some guys,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they just stay under the radar and just </v>

2675
02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.590
<v Speaker 5>third guys like that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2676
02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:30.520
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

2677
02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that's it.</v>

2678
02:03:34.030 --> 02:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Everything gets thoroughly tested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

2679
02:03:35.831 --> 02:03:36.664
<v Speaker 1>That's the fun part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the amazing thing about us and one </v>

2680
02:03:39.011 --> 02:03:39.844
<v Speaker 1>of the things that I love is we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>interns and people from all across the </v>

2681
02:03:43.001 --> 02:03:43.834
<v Speaker 1>country that have sometimes very little </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and sometimes their input is </v>

2682
02:03:47.561 --> 02:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>the most valuable for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a bunch of people who are like,</v>

2683
02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I know it all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2684
02:03:52.210 --> 02:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about that.</v>

2685
02:03:53.531 --> 02:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Nobody does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get this girl from Ohio.</v>

2686
02:03:57.971 --> 02:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what about this?</v>

2687
02:04:00.971 --> 02:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And this happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

2688
02:04:04.210 --> 02:04:05.380
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2689
02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.333
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a fresh brand new </v>

2690
02:04:07.571 --> 02:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>perspective of somebody who just started</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting.</v>

2691
02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's been an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly valuable on our line too.</v>

2692
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2693
02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:15.800
<v Speaker 6>living there too is it's living in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>mountains,</v>

2694
02:04:15.850 --> 02:04:18.470
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you get to take stuff from all different</v>

2695
02:04:18.650 --> 02:04:19.970
<v Speaker 6>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whether you're,</v>

2696
02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:21.033
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>riding your bike or whether you're back </v>

2697
02:04:22.671 --> 02:04:25.550
<v Speaker 6>country skiing,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a lot of that stuff crosses over,</v>

2698
02:04:25.551 --> 02:04:26.384
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I think that allows us to round </v>

2699
02:04:28.131 --> 02:04:29.360
<v Speaker 6>things out nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2700
02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:31.040
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hiking,</v>

2701
02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:33.230
<v Speaker 6>hunting is quite different than hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2702
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:34.363
<v Speaker 6>Like hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>people want to build the lightest thing </v>

2703
02:04:35.661 --> 02:04:38.760
<v Speaker 6>they can build that can do whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hunting totally different.</v>

2704
02:04:38.761 --> 02:04:40.470
<v Speaker 6>You're off the trail,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're going through bushes,</v>

2705
02:04:40.471 --> 02:04:43.320
<v Speaker 6>like you kind of have to throw that </v>
<v Speaker 6>lightest thing out the window,</v>

2706
02:04:43.321 --> 02:04:44.154
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you have to approach it of like how </v>

2707
02:04:45.961 --> 02:04:49.560
<v Speaker 6>heavy can I actually build this and have</v>
<v Speaker 6>it still work well because it's going to</v>

2708
02:04:49.561 --> 02:04:51.000
<v Speaker 6>get thrashed,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what I mean?</v>

2709
02:04:51.001 --> 02:04:54.870
<v Speaker 6>So you've got to approach it from kind </v>
<v Speaker 6>of a different shift and how,</v>

2710
02:04:55.290 --> 02:04:58.020
<v Speaker 6>you know when you build stuff it needs </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be versatile,</v>

2711
02:04:58.021 --> 02:04:58.320
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2712
02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:00.900
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2713
02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:01.860
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It did.</v>

2714
02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:02.694
<v Speaker 6>The equivalent would be like having a </v>
<v Speaker 6>guy that was a construction worker and </v>

2715
02:05:04.741 --> 02:05:07.980
<v Speaker 6>he's got an eight penny nail.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's got a 16 penny nails.</v>

2716
02:05:07.981 --> 02:05:10.260
<v Speaker 6>He have ate penny hammer and a 16 penny </v>
<v Speaker 6>hammer.</v>

2717
02:05:10.261 --> 02:05:11.340
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2718
02:05:11.341 --> 02:05:13.980
<v Speaker 6>you need to be able to do everything </v>
<v Speaker 6>with,</v>

2719
02:05:14.400 --> 02:05:17.070
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a certain amount of stuff because you're</v>

2720
02:05:17.071 --> 02:05:19.500
<v Speaker 6>going out in the woods and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might be walking slow,</v>

2721
02:05:19.501 --> 02:05:21.780
<v Speaker 6>you might be stopping,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you might be going uphill,</v>

2722
02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:23.460
<v Speaker 6>you might be going down hill,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2723
02:05:23.461 --> 02:05:26.760
<v Speaker 6>and it just allows carrying fewer things</v>
<v Speaker 6>that do more job.</v>

2724
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:27.703
<v Speaker 2>And then you might have to go through </v>
<v Speaker 2>thick brush and you might have to have </v>

2725
02:05:30.201 --> 02:05:31.034
<v Speaker 2>clothes that are durable or if you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas you might have stuff that has </v>

2726
02:05:33.741 --> 02:05:34.574
<v Speaker 2>thorns and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be ripping your clothes </v>

2727
02:05:36.621 --> 02:05:38.920
<v Speaker 2>and don't go to Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't go to that effort.</v>

2728
02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:39.833
<v Speaker 2>Everything stabs you in Texas is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas is a great example of what could </v>

2729
02:05:46.011 --> 02:05:50.270
<v Speaker 2>possibly happen if we lost public lands </v>
<v Speaker 2>because Texas is weird.</v>

2730
02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:52.490
<v Speaker 2>I love Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong.</v>

2731
02:05:52.491 --> 02:05:54.050
<v Speaker 2>I love the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the people.</v>

2732
02:05:54.051 --> 02:05:59.000
<v Speaker 2>It's one of my favorite places on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Texas hunting is very strange.</v>

2733
02:05:59.210 --> 02:06:03.440
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of it that's high fence </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of it is like over feeders.</v>

2734
02:06:03.441 --> 02:06:04.274
<v Speaker 2>They have like these feed machines and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these animals come to the feed machines </v>

2735
02:06:06.861 --> 02:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>and they're overrun with wild pigs and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then an amputee is fucking weird.</v>

2736
02:06:10.160 --> 02:06:12.710
<v Speaker 2>African animals that you can hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>anytime you want.</v>

2737
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:14.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

2738
02:06:14.540 --> 02:06:16.640
<v Speaker 2>It was a bit for my last special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's true.</v>

2739
02:06:16.641 --> 02:06:17.474
<v Speaker 2>There's more tigers in captivity in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas than there are in all of the wild </v>

2740
02:06:21.681 --> 02:06:22.940
<v Speaker 2>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2741
02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2742
02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling me that's not true.</v>

2743
02:06:25.510 --> 02:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Totally true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more tigers and dudes.</v>

2744
02:06:27.861 --> 02:06:30.440
<v Speaker 2>Fucking backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's private collections.</v>

2745
02:06:30.441 --> 02:06:32.390
<v Speaker 2>Not Zeus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Wildlife.</v>

2746
02:06:32.391 --> 02:06:33.224
<v Speaker 2>Sanctuaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More Tigers in private collections in </v>

2747
02:06:35.751 --> 02:06:39.050

<v Speaker 2>There's no laws in Texas.</v>

2748
02:06:39.290 --> 02:06:40.990
<v Speaker 2>You just can't have wheat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No wheat for your.</v>

2749
02:06:41.530 --> 02:06:43.160
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No gay marriage.</v>

2750
02:06:43.161 --> 02:06:45.320
<v Speaker 2>No Lien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to hunt in Texas,</v>

2751
02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:47.100
<v Speaker 2>but clean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet,</v>

2752
02:06:47.210 --> 02:06:49.130
<v Speaker 2>but I would like to 100 there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

2753
02:06:49.131 --> 02:06:53.510
<v Speaker 2>I love Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you like they have like symitar oryx</v>

2754
02:06:53.511 --> 02:06:57.450
<v Speaker 2>and fucking Elan's and all these weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>African animals that are running around.</v>

2755
02:06:57.480 --> 02:06:58.313
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are more captive tigers in Texas </v>

2756
02:06:59.721 --> 02:07:00.620
<v Speaker 2>than in the wild.</v>

2757
02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:03.380
<v Speaker 2>As real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As real as fuck,</v>

2758
02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:06.290
<v Speaker 2>but yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need the type of innovation.</v>

2759
02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.133
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>privately owned big cats including </v>

2760
02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:10.753
<v Speaker 2>tigers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lions and cougars currently living in </v>

2761
02:07:12.771 --> 02:07:13.604
<v Speaker 2>captivity in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the exact number is unknown due to </v>

2762
02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:17.053
<v Speaker 2>insufficient recordkeeping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of your fucking business quarter </v>

2763
02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:24.730
<v Speaker 2>doesn't count like those little kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those little whatever.</v>

2764
02:07:24.740 --> 02:07:26.570
<v Speaker 2>No Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been to Texas and I've,</v>

2765
02:07:26.571 --> 02:07:27.404
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend in Texas that has a </v>

2766
02:07:28.821 --> 02:07:31.910
<v Speaker 2>buddy of his that has a fucking tiger </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing and his yard,</v>

2767
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:36.790
<v Speaker 2>he's got this giant fenced out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Area's got a giant and in his ranch he's</v>

2768
02:07:36.791 --> 02:07:40.480
<v Speaker 2>got a bunch of fucking tigers and it'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>just feed them like a cow.</v>

2769
02:07:40.730 --> 02:07:42.080
<v Speaker 2>They'll live cow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2770
02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:45.070
<v Speaker 2>well they could if you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we won't admit it to me,</v>

2771
02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:48.040
<v Speaker 2>but they'd take a cow or calf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot it in the head,</v>

2772
02:07:48.070 --> 02:07:49.030
<v Speaker 2>toss it over the fence.</v>

2773
02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:51.030
<v Speaker 2>These things tear it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unreal.</v>

2774
02:07:51.070 --> 02:07:52.660
<v Speaker 2>And they watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ha.</v>

2775
02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:54.850
<v Speaker 2>They fucking drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A couple of Budweiser says,</v>

2776
02:07:54.940 --> 02:07:58.120
<v Speaker 2>fuck their cousin and he ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

2777
02:07:58.870 --> 02:08:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Chief of Dallas and his wife are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>proud owners of three,</v>

2778
02:08:02.130 --> 02:08:04.990
<v Speaker 2>600 pound tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have raised since they were born,</v>

2779
02:08:05.020 --> 02:08:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>police chief in Dallas,</v>

2780
02:08:08.290 --> 02:08:10.900
<v Speaker 2>former police chief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

2781
02:08:11.650 --> 02:08:12.483
<v Speaker 2>Like many Texans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Rathburn is no longer satisfied </v>

2782
02:08:14.921 --> 02:08:18.040
<v Speaker 2>with an ordinary pit will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a German shepherd,</v>

2783
02:08:18.041 --> 02:08:21.760
<v Speaker 2>but that queer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you want to do is Hump my leg.</v>

2784
02:08:22.810 --> 02:08:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Tired of this Nigga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Goddamn American animal.</v>

2785
02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:29.680
<v Speaker 2>These cats tend to mind me even though I</v>
<v Speaker 2>use no discipline.</v>

2786
02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:31.330
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no discipline at all.</v>

2787
02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:33.730
<v Speaker 2>Shut your fucking mouth before you get </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>

2788
02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:34.593
<v Speaker 2>He has 22 tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy said he's even trained these </v>

2789
02:08:36.521 --> 02:08:39.280
<v Speaker 2>tigers to remain team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

2790
02:08:39.281 --> 02:08:42.700
<v Speaker 2>You unfortunately you can buy at tiger </v>
<v Speaker 2>for less than a thousand dollars.</v>

2791
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Now it makes me think tigers do new.</v>

2792
02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:50.050
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas has completely different laws when</v>

2793
02:08:50.051 --> 02:08:54.220
<v Speaker 2>it comes to wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wildlife in Texas is not.</v>

2794
02:08:54.490 --> 02:08:58.210
<v Speaker 2>It's it's private property.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a whole different situation.</v>

2795
02:08:58.480 --> 02:08:59.313
<v Speaker 2>I mean they have tags and it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like white tail deer and indigenous </v>

2796
02:09:01.571 --> 02:09:03.440
<v Speaker 2>species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes in,</v>

2797
02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.380
<v Speaker 2>who knows if even the white tails are </v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous,</v>

2798
02:09:05.381 --> 02:09:06.214
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're bringing them in from </v>

2799
02:09:07.271 --> 02:09:10.390
<v Speaker 2>farms so they have bigger racks now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a lot of weird shit.</v>

2800
02:09:10.391 --> 02:09:13.450
<v Speaker 2>They do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it must be if you have a high fence,</v>

2801
02:09:14.050 --> 02:09:17.770
<v Speaker 2>then it's once you add things like fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>fenced,</v>

2802
02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:20.320
<v Speaker 2>everything within becomes private.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2803
02:09:20.370 --> 02:09:22.240
<v Speaker 2>it must be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's exactly what it is,</v>

2804
02:09:22.241 --> 02:09:27.241
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of like eastlands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a oryx and all these African animals and</v>

2805
02:09:27.611 --> 02:09:28.444
<v Speaker 2>the axis deer that have gone rogue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've gotten through fences and now </v>

2806
02:09:31.421 --> 02:09:33.700
<v Speaker 2>they're just wild and free range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our Dad,</v>

2807
02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:34.593
<v Speaker 2>what do they call them in?</v>

2808
02:09:34.610 --> 02:09:36.370
<v Speaker 2>In New Zealand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Convicts.</v>

2809
02:09:37.180 --> 02:09:38.950
<v Speaker 2>Escapees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>escapees.</v>

2810
02:09:39.550 --> 02:09:42.400
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be crazy if a cat got loose,</v>

2811
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:44.020
<v Speaker 2>it could go nuts out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2812
02:09:44.070 --> 02:09:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure it's happened.</v>

2813
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure if you drive down the road </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere in Jasper,</v>

2814
02:09:49.631 --> 02:09:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Texas or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that tire.</v>

2815
02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Scariest thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tigers in Texas.</v>

2816
02:09:55.931 --> 02:09:59.890
<v Speaker 2>We don't even know how many there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2817
02:09:59.891 --> 02:10:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm blown away right now.</v>

2818
02:10:03.060 --> 02:10:04.190
<v Speaker 2>I have a whole bit about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2819
02:10:04.220 --> 02:10:07.340
<v Speaker 2>She watched this come out of the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This.</v>

2820
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:08.743
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>

2821
02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:12.490
<v Speaker 2>It's a very Texas a very odd place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I wanted to highlight is like,</v>

2822
02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:13.593
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want that to be the only way </v>

2823
02:10:14.501 --> 02:10:16.540
<v Speaker 2>you can get a hunting experience because</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas is,</v>

2824
02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:18.850
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We weren't,</v>

2825
02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:20.140
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't have jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2826
02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:20.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2827
02:10:20.830 --> 02:10:24.460
<v Speaker 2>The reason for innovation is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition,</v>

2828
02:10:24.461 --> 02:10:27.400
<v Speaker 2>that being outside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing yourself,</v>

2829
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:28.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climb,</v>

2830
02:10:28.890 --> 02:10:29.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new peaks.</v>

2831
02:10:29.950 --> 02:10:30.783
<v Speaker 2>Why is the hunting clothing industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of fucking high school </v>

2832
02:10:33.351 --> 02:10:34.130
<v Speaker 2>girls?</v>

2833
02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:34.940
<v Speaker 5>Because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

2834
02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:38.590
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of weirdness like cliques,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you were Sitka,</v>

2835
02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:40.160
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to wear cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You.</v>

2836
02:10:40.161 --> 02:10:42.720
<v Speaker 5>If you were cool you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're not supposed to wear firstly may.</v>

2837
02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:43.673
<v Speaker 5>I thought you were an under armour guy </v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting over there with that first </v>

2838
02:10:46.041 --> 02:10:48.260
<v Speaker 5>lectured on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what are you,</v>

2839
02:10:48.261 --> 02:10:50.570
<v Speaker 5>bunch of fucking girls,</v>
<v Speaker 5>high school girls.</v>

2840
02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:53.150
<v Speaker 5>Not that there's anything wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 5>being a girl or being in high school.</v>

2841
02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:55.280
<v Speaker 5>I used to be in high school and every </v>
<v Speaker 5>girl,</v>

2842
02:10:55.281 --> 02:10:58.160
<v Speaker 5>but I have no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm glad you picked that to clear up,</v>

2843
02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:00.180
<v Speaker 5>but you know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like fucking,</v>

2844
02:11:00.190 --> 02:11:03.260
<v Speaker 5>it's like a clicky little weird thing </v>
<v Speaker 5>where they're on teams.</v>

2845
02:11:03.261 --> 02:11:03.621
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

<v Speaker 5>there's no goddamn teams.</v>

2847
02:11:05.970 --> 02:11:09.390
<v Speaker 5>Like I had a conversation with one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>the Sitka,</v>

2848
02:11:09.570 --> 02:11:11.420
<v Speaker 5>Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jason Harrison found the,</v>

02:11:11.550 --> 02:11:13.700
<v Speaker 5>you started out with Sitka and then he,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

2850
02:11:13.701 --> 02:11:14.534
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they pushed them out and they bought it </v>

2851
02:11:15.621 --> 02:11:17.750
<v Speaker 5>out and I'm sick of guys in the cool.</v>

2852
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:18.583
<v Speaker 5>You guys don't get along.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you guys are out of your fucking </v>

2853
02:11:20.661 --> 02:11:23.680
<v Speaker 5>minds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This shit bro.</v>

2854
02:11:23.720 --> 02:11:24.553
<v Speaker 5>Staff thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's where that green team </v>

2855
02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:28.131
<v Speaker 5>mentality,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2856
02:11:28.131 --> 02:11:31.070
<v Speaker 5>it's the same thing as people from Texas</v>
<v Speaker 5>that don't like people from Wyoming,</v>

2857
02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:32.001
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>superbowl and kicked her.</v>

2860
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:38.150
<v Speaker 5>It was really hard to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>

2861
02:11:38.180 --> 02:11:40.250
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're very friendly with.</v>

2862
02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:42.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you guys are you guys on.</v>

2863
02:11:42.740 --> 02:11:43.573
<v Speaker 5>I think it'd be real hard for me to </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe that anybody's out there being </v>

2864
02:11:45.651 --> 02:11:46.580
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

2865
02:11:46.700 --> 02:11:49.610
<v Speaker 5>if you put this on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you fucking hate those people.</v>

2866
02:11:49.670 --> 02:11:51.610
<v Speaker 5>Oh definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's people like that out there.</v>

2867
02:11:51.670 --> 02:11:53.450
<v Speaker 5>People kind of just pick it up and run </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it.</v>

2868
02:11:53.530 --> 02:11:54.363
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Some,</v>

2869
02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.500
<v Speaker 5>I'm sure some people are ultra </v>
<v Speaker 5>competitive and it comes from that,</v>

2870
02:11:57.501 --> 02:11:59.510
<v Speaker 5>like just the way it is in business,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2871
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:01.010
<v Speaker 5>Instead of concentrating on what you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>

2872
02:12:01.011 --> 02:12:01.844
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people concentrate on the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that are doing what you're doing </v>

2873
02:12:03.381 --> 02:12:03.680
<v Speaker 5>in this.</v>

2874
02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:06.750
<v Speaker 5>These fuckers are trying to get us and </v>
<v Speaker 5>we need it Vogan manner,</v>

2875
02:12:07.220 --> 02:12:09.530
<v Speaker 5>but the competition is good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the good part.</v>

2876
02:12:09.531 --> 02:12:10.090
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

2877
02:12:10.090 --> 02:12:10.923
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The competition is amazing because you </v>

2878
02:12:11.901 --> 02:12:15.160
<v Speaker 5>guys are constantly elevating your game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I said,</v>

2879
02:12:15.500 --> 02:12:16.333
<v Speaker 5>Ryan,</v>

2885
02:12:27.441 --> 02:12:30.560

<v Speaker 5>like when you're walking in them,</v>

2886
02:12:30.561 --> 02:12:34.130
<v Speaker 5>there's no binding at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're tough and durable and I'm like,</v>

2887
02:12:34.131 --> 02:12:36.260
<v Speaker 5>you guys nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You nailed it on a lot of stuff.</v>

2888
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:38.610
<v Speaker 6>It's a cool system in that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2889
02:12:38.611 --> 02:12:40.770
<v Speaker 6>generally speaking you go to a few </v>
<v Speaker 6>different shows,</v>

2890
02:12:40.771 --> 02:12:44.220
<v Speaker 6>like the outdoor retailer and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you get to see all the best stuff,</v>

2891
02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:47.090
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like whether it be from the Albert,</v>

2892
02:12:47.130 --> 02:12:49.070
<v Speaker 6>Patagonia,</v>
<v Speaker 6>everything.</v>

2893
02:12:49.470 --> 02:12:51.090
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you know,</v>

2894
02:12:51.091 --> 02:12:54.420
<v Speaker 6>you get to build the best thing you can </v>
<v Speaker 6>build and there's like,</v>

2895
02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:57.450
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a couple of few companies that literally</v>

2896
02:12:57.451 --> 02:13:00.390
<v Speaker 6>like us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that cost is no object.</v>

2897
02:13:00.391 --> 02:13:01.224
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's way down the list and I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wish we're making things as cheap as </v>

2898
02:13:03.961 --> 02:13:04.794
<v Speaker 6>we can and that's still expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a fun thing to be able to make </v>

2899
02:13:07.530 --> 02:13:09.170
<v Speaker 6>the best you can make.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2900
02:13:09.210 --> 02:13:11.910
<v Speaker 6>And some people might say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>

2901
02:13:11.911 --> 02:13:14.130
<v Speaker 6>our steps better because we,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2902
02:13:14.131 --> 02:13:15.840
<v Speaker 6>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what it is,</v>

2903
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:16.640
<v Speaker 6>but</v>

2904
02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.400
<v Speaker 5>everything is so good now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 5>hunting in 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is incredible.</v>

2908
02:13:26.960 --> 02:13:27.793

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2912
02:13:33.450 --> 02:13:34.283

<v Speaker 2>of competition and innovation and it's </v>

2913
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:39.713
<v Speaker 2>for people that don't even hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can get your stuff in solid </v>

02:16:07.171 --> 02:16:08.670
<v Speaker 6>I think there was enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

2976
02:16:08.671 --> 02:16:10.170
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2977
02:16:10.171 --> 02:16:12.480

<v Speaker 6>So they're not afraid to call each other</v>

2978
02:16:12.481 --> 02:16:14.300
<v Speaker 6>a pussy if some things go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>

2979
02:16:14.790 --> 02:16:16.290
<v Speaker 6>They heard on the news.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2980
02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:17.221
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're,</v>

2981
02:16:17.221 --> 02:16:18.054
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're into their extreme sporty and </v>

2982
02:16:20.311 --> 02:16:21.930
<v Speaker 6>they're skiers mountain bikers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then,</v>

2983
02:16:21.931 --> 02:16:23.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>inevitably it's like,</v>

2984
02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:24.773
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's the jump built or something and </v>

2985
02:16:25.621 --> 02:16:27.300
<v Speaker 6>first thing like it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 6>as,</v>

2986
02:16:27.301 --> 02:16:29.580
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the p right?</v>

2987
02:16:29.590 --> 02:16:30.020

2988
02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:30.581
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plan.</v>

2989
02:16:30.581 --> 02:16:31.930
<v Speaker 2>That was the first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2990
02:16:31.970 --> 02:16:33.510
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2991
02:16:33.670 --> 02:16:34.840
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2992
02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:37.400

<v Speaker 2>do you like that?</v>

2993
02:16:37.401 --> 02:16:38.081
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2994
02:16:38.081 --> 02:16:39.730
<v Speaker 2>She's serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she did not.</v>

2995
02:16:40.090 --> 02:16:42.400
<v Speaker 2>That was not going to be a derogatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>term and that's fine.</v>

2996
02:16:42.401 --> 02:16:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

2997
02:16:44.291 --> 02:16:47.080
<v Speaker 2>it was funny because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll heckle each other and you know,</v>

2998
02:16:47.081 --> 02:16:47.914
<v Speaker 2>they're boys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all,</v>

2999
02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:51.250
<v Speaker 2>they want to get after some nasty </v>
<v Speaker 2>gnarly.</v>

3000
02:16:51.251 --> 02:16:52.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3001
02:16:52.481 --> 02:16:53.314
<v Speaker 2>jump or whatever on their bikes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody's got a Guinea pig it and sure </v>

3002
02:16:55.961 --> 02:16:58.360
<v Speaker 2>enough it's probably the one that got </v>
<v Speaker 2>called a pussy first.</v>

3003
02:16:58.361 --> 02:17:00.450
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we don't do well for my,</v>

3004
02:17:00.510 --> 02:17:02.080
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Donald Trump,</v>

3005
02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:02.973
<v Speaker 2>the whole story came out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great because then all of a </v>

3006
02:17:04.691 --> 02:17:05.524
<v Speaker 2>sudden everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many people are saying pussy and it </v>

3007
02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:08.273
<v Speaker 2>seems like this country's like backing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had gotten some weird politically </v>

3008
02:17:12.341 --> 02:17:16.780
<v Speaker 2>correct phase just in the last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>years where people are so mad at so many</v>

3009
02:17:16.781 --> 02:17:17.614
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

3010
02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:18.543
<v Speaker 2>Different groups are so mad at the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture is that there was all these </v>

3011
02:17:22.781 --> 02:17:23.614
<v Speaker 2>words you weren't allowed to say anymore</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there was all these new things like </v>

3012
02:17:26.170 --> 02:17:29.220
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to wear sombreros </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's cultural appropriation.</v>

3013
02:17:29.221 --> 02:17:31.840
<v Speaker 2>They were getting mad at people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>cooking other cultures,</v>

3014
02:17:31.841 --> 02:17:32.674
<v Speaker 2>dishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people got so politically correct </v>

3015
02:17:34.510 --> 02:17:35.343
<v Speaker 2>that like the good thing about Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>trump being in office is that I said </v>

3016
02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:39.483
<v Speaker 2>that political correctness is just took </v>
<v Speaker 2>a missile to the Deq because like that </v>

3017
02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:46.170
<v Speaker 2>guy as the fucking commander in chief </v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3018
02:17:46.210 --> 02:17:47.710
<v Speaker 2>that political correctness shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3019
02:17:47.711 --> 02:17:50.320
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem very effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work here.</v>

3020
02:17:50.530 --> 02:17:52.600
<v Speaker 2>Like you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't and people are fighting and of</v>

3021
02:17:52.601 --> 02:17:54.940
<v Speaker 2>course in rallying and protesting and </v>
<v Speaker 2>all that jazz.</v>

3022
02:17:55.390 --> 02:17:57.250
<v Speaker 2>But it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The good thing about,</v>

3023
02:17:57.270 --> 02:17:58.630
<v Speaker 2>it's like you realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3024
02:17:58.631 --> 02:18:01.390
<v Speaker 2>that's just a word like pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a word.</v>

3025
02:18:01.420 --> 02:18:03.670
<v Speaker 2>Like in that guy was saying pussy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now he's the president.</v>

3026
02:18:03.690 --> 02:18:07.630
<v Speaker 2>Like it's not really like this is like </v>
<v Speaker 2>taboo word that summons demons,</v>

3027
02:18:07.631 --> 02:18:08.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3028
02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:11.050
<v Speaker 2>it's just a word and its intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's important.</v>

3029
02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:12.033
<v Speaker 2>It's not demonizing words and making </v>
<v Speaker 2>these words impossible to say because </v>

3030
02:18:15.851 --> 02:18:16.684
<v Speaker 2>we've made them like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain words now that you just </v>

3031
02:18:18.611 --> 02:18:22.900
<v Speaker 2>can't say in our culture or people get </v>
<v Speaker 2>upset at you that were real common.</v>

3032
02:18:22.901 --> 02:18:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Like retard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He calls someone to retard.</v>

3033
02:18:24.701 --> 02:18:27.040
<v Speaker 2>You're not saying someone has a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3034
02:18:27.041 --> 02:18:27.874
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying someone's a fucking </v>

3035
02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:29.810
<v Speaker 2>knucklehead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the cars retarded.</v>

3036
02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:32.500
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know the intent of that word,</v>

3037
02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:33.520
<v Speaker 2>but people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3038
02:18:33.521 --> 02:18:35.800
<v Speaker 2>don't say that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's offensive will.</v>

3039
02:18:35.801 --> 02:18:36.634
<v Speaker 2>The more you create offensive words and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you create words that are not </v>

3040
02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:42.340
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to say them.</v>

3041
02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:44.980
<v Speaker 2>The more you get to give those words </v>
<v Speaker 2>power and people are going to,</v>

3042
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:46.480
<v Speaker 2>they can't wait to se them.</v>

3043
02:18:46.810 --> 02:18:47.643
<v Speaker 2>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then those words become like nuclear </v>

3044
02:18:50.340 --> 02:18:52.240
<v Speaker 2>nuclear option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you've got something right.</v>

3045
02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:55.180
<v Speaker 2>You've got the c word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know it's,</v>

3046
02:18:55.210 --> 02:18:57.040
<v Speaker 2>you're always holding onto that one for </v>
<v Speaker 2>chickens.</v>

3047
02:18:57.041 --> 02:18:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3048
02:18:58.250 --> 02:19:02.320
<v Speaker 2>like listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

3049
02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:03.513
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to come back from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not an equivalent word for men </v>

3050
02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:09.050
<v Speaker 2>like bike telling us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't say that word.</v>

3051
02:19:09.051 --> 02:19:09.884
<v Speaker 2>You can call it dicks all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fucking Dick App guilty as charged </v>

3052
02:19:12.770 --> 02:19:16.910
<v Speaker 2>on tv now practically that you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as long as it's not like a,</v>

3053
02:19:17.410 --> 02:19:19.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think like NBC,</v>

3054
02:19:19.130 --> 02:19:21.010
<v Speaker 2>CBS,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still don't use it,</v>

3055
02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:23.410
<v Speaker 2>but like any cable show they use that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3056
02:19:23.710 --> 02:19:24.543
<v Speaker 2>All I know is Kenton's wife tends to </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at me like that is the source of </v>

3057
02:19:29.510 --> 02:19:32.930
<v Speaker 2>looseness right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's single man with a mustache.</v>

3058
02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:37.130
<v Speaker 2>This man got cut loose to spend too much</v>
<v Speaker 2>time with him.</v>

3059
02:19:37.130 --> 02:19:38.270
<v Speaker 2>It could all go down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3060
02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:40.370
<v Speaker 2>just go feral.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3061
02:19:40.640 --> 02:19:41.271
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

3062
02:19:41.271 --> 02:19:42.104
<v Speaker 2>Like no one tells Ryan were to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ryan can just go into the woods anytime </v>

3063
02:19:44.811 --> 02:19:45.950
<v Speaker 2>he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's right.</v>

3064
02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:46.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about he doesn't have a leash on </v>

3065
02:19:48.380 --> 02:19:52.390
<v Speaker 2>how many times did he call and check was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just out there with no leash collar.</v>

3066
02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I get a long leash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get along,</v>

3067
02:19:54.470 --> 02:19:57.030
<v Speaker 2>especially during hunting season,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but mark might still elite.</v>

3068
02:19:57.270 --> 02:19:59.420
<v Speaker 2>You have a leash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian doesn't have elite.</v>

3069
02:19:59.470 --> 02:20:01.310
<v Speaker 2>She's just asked him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have to call anybody.</v>

3070
02:20:01.311 --> 02:20:03.110
<v Speaker 2>He just goes where he wants it is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

3071
02:20:03.350 --> 02:20:05.780
<v Speaker 2>But if he just decides to take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>mustache and go for a hike,</v>

3072
02:20:06.650 --> 02:20:09.230
<v Speaker 2>nobody can tell them that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

3073
02:20:09.380 --> 02:20:11.750
<v Speaker 2>that pisses women off because then then </v>
<v Speaker 2>demand goes,</v>

<v Speaker 2>whenever he wants.</v>

3076
02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:17.630
<v Speaker 2>I wish I was like that.</v>

3077

02:21:36.711 --> 02:21:37.520
<v Speaker 2>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

3110
02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:38.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

3111
02:21:38.470 --> 02:21:39.080
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

3112
02:21:39.080 --> 02:21:41.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ability to checkout.</v>

3113
02:21:41.980 --> 02:21:44.440
<v Speaker 4>We can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean where we are,</v>

3114
02:21:45.010 --> 02:21:48.910
<v Speaker 4>it is narrow valley public land </v>
<v Speaker 4>everywhere.</v>

3115
02:21:49.450 --> 02:21:50.283
<v Speaker 4>As soon as you get off the valley floor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on public land like we talked </v>

3116
02:21:52.331 --> 02:21:53.170
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can hate.</v>

3117
02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:55.300
<v Speaker 4>I can hate to the fricking Yukon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3118
02:21:55.810 --> 02:21:56.643
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy and you can be disconnected</v>
<v Speaker 4>as disconnected as you want to be and </v>

3119
02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:07.200
<v Speaker 4>there is no price tag on that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That and I need.</v>

3120
02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the constant dilemma amongst</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of hunters,</v>

3121
02:22:10.561 --> 02:22:11.394
<v Speaker 2>especially the really hardcore guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the podcast that I listened to </v>

3122
02:22:13.351 --> 02:22:14.184
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the big dilemma is how much time </v>

3123
02:22:17.821 --> 02:22:21.240
<v Speaker 2>does your family allow you to get out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much?</v>

3124
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:24.840
<v Speaker 2>How much time can you spend?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you do one of those 30 day trips?</v>

3125
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:26.003
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's a lot of guys that do like </v>

3126
02:22:26.910 --> 02:22:30.360
<v Speaker 2>a 30 day trip that's pretty heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a heavy as fuck,</v>

3127
02:22:30.361 --> 02:22:33.290
<v Speaker 2>but there's some street cred to that or </v>
<v Speaker 2>should I say trail cred.</v>

3128
02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:35.070
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3129
02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:36.940
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3130
02:22:36.940 --> 02:22:38.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm fucking Raylynn said to me once,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was really funny,</v>

3131
02:22:38.851 --> 02:22:39.720
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were laughing.</v>

3132
02:22:39.721 --> 02:22:40.554
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about grizzly man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the Werner Herzog </v>

3133
02:22:42.181 --> 02:22:44.180
<v Speaker 2>documentary and Rinella was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3134
02:22:44.340 --> 02:22:45.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3135
02:22:45.870 --> 02:22:48.420
<v Speaker 2>that guy did some fucking hard camping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

3136
02:22:48.421 --> 02:22:49.254
<v Speaker 2>I got to respect that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy was a hard camper coming from </v>

3137
02:22:53.140 --> 02:22:58.140
<v Speaker 2>things the hard way it no one loves the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way more than Manila.</v>

3138
02:22:58.950 --> 02:23:00.040
<v Speaker 2>He loves it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3139
02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

3140
02:23:00.810 --> 02:23:01.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something to be said for it </v>

3141
02:23:02.581 --> 02:23:05.190
<v Speaker 4>because just like we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3142
02:23:05.191 --> 02:23:06.024
<v Speaker 4>things get more pc or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's you start patting yourself and all </v>

3143
02:23:09.931 --> 02:23:11.970
<v Speaker 4>of a sudden you don't know what rough </v>
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>

3144
02:23:12.080 --> 02:23:13.490
<v Speaker 2>Safe spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NERF,</v>

3145
02:23:13.491 --> 02:23:14.324
<v Speaker 2>the hard edges of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's super important that we'd be </v>

3146
02:23:16.071 --> 02:23:16.904
<v Speaker 2>totally inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Competition is not a bad thing and </v>

3147
02:23:19.491 --> 02:23:20.324
<v Speaker 2>there's no more primal competition than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you trying to go out and get your own </v>

3148
02:23:23.511 --> 02:23:27.610
<v Speaker 2>food that's running around trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay alive and what do you have?</v>

3149
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:28.463
<v Speaker 2>You got a pointy stick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to shoot another </v>

3150
02:23:30.310 --> 02:23:31.143
<v Speaker 2>concession.</v>

3151
02:23:31.530 --> 02:23:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Every time a hunter goes into the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something dies.</v>

3152
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:36.750
<v Speaker 4>That's what I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I hear all the time.</v>

3153
02:23:36.751 --> 02:23:37.530
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3154
02:23:37.530 --> 02:23:40.890
<v Speaker 4>I saw five people go into the woods </v>
<v Speaker 4>behind my house on a public easement.</v>

3155
02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:41.813
<v Speaker 4>I was at a city council meeting </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening to this Gal talk somebody </v>

3156
02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:50.730
<v Speaker 4>public easement so people can access </v>
<v Speaker 4>public land.</v>

3157
02:23:51.330 --> 02:23:52.163
<v Speaker 4>Only way their housing development got </v>
<v Speaker 4>built was so that because they allowed </v>

3158
02:23:55.081 --> 02:23:57.780
<v Speaker 4>to easements so people could get to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>public land.</v>

3159
02:23:58.290 --> 02:24:01.530
<v Speaker 4>She's saying that five people went past </v>
<v Speaker 4>her house and five elk died.</v>

3160
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:04.260
<v Speaker 4>It's like not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you right now.</v>

3161
02:24:04.261 --> 02:24:05.094
<v Speaker 4>It's never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't punch my tag until the absolute </v>

3162
02:24:07.531 --> 02:24:11.550
<v Speaker 4>last day because as soon as I clip it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gotta be back into work.</v>

3163
02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:15.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've had conversations with </v>

3164
02:24:15.851 --> 02:24:17.170
<v Speaker 2>people that don't understand the like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3165
02:24:17.171 --> 02:24:18.460
<v Speaker 2>you go out there and you shoot these </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

3166
02:24:18.461 --> 02:24:18.851
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3167
02:24:18.851 --> 02:24:20.890
<v Speaker 2>you go out there and you try to get an </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

3168
02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:22.900
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how often are you successful?</v>

3169
02:24:22.901 --> 02:24:23.201
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3170
02:24:23.201 --> 02:24:26.650
<v Speaker 2>I went on 500 slabs and I'm super </v>
<v Speaker 2>dedicated practice constantly.</v>

3171
02:24:26.651 --> 02:24:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm absorbed in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five hundred,</v>

3172
02:24:28.871 --> 02:24:31.240
<v Speaker 2>three of them aren't successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's.</v>

3173
02:24:31.241 --> 02:24:33.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a good average.</v>

3174
02:24:33.960 --> 02:24:36.050
<v Speaker 2>So you're spending 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3175
02:24:36.051 --> 02:24:36.884
<v Speaker 2>like each,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each hunt at least five days out in the </v>

3176

<v Speaker 2>woods and just nothing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>to see them learning things for the </v>

3204
02:25:39.250 --> 02:25:41.170
<v Speaker 2>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will never happen again.</v>

3205
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:42.663
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything they learned for the first </v>

3206
02:25:43.691 --> 02:25:44.411
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like every,</v>

3207
02:25:44.411 --> 02:25:45.244
<v Speaker 2>the first time they went skiing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the this look on their face </v>

3208
02:25:47.141 --> 02:25:50.050
<v Speaker 2>like we've got the mittens on like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is crazy.</v>

3209
02:25:50.290 --> 02:25:51.123
<v Speaker 2>I've got a helmet on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether they're so happy and excited </v>

3210
02:25:53.321 --> 02:25:55.180
<v Speaker 2>like there's never gonna be a first like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that again.</v>

3211
02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:58.270
<v Speaker 2>And the more first you can have in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

3212
02:25:58.271 --> 02:26:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I think the better and more rich your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life will be.</v>

3213
02:26:00.760 --> 02:26:01.593
<v Speaker 2>The more experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more times you can learn thing and </v>

3214
02:26:03.941 --> 02:26:04.774
<v Speaker 2>people get locked into these patterns in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life and I don't know why it </v>

3215
02:26:08.081 --> 02:26:13.081
<v Speaker 2>happens and I don't know what causes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we get a job and we get a career and</v>

3216
02:26:13.301 --> 02:26:16.060
<v Speaker 2>we get a path and a neighborhood and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's boom,</v>

3217
02:26:16.090 --> 02:26:16.923
<v Speaker 2>and then the first stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no more firsts and then it </v>

3218
02:26:19.571 --> 02:26:20.404
<v Speaker 2>becomes the same shit over and over </v>
<v Speaker 2>again in life becomes mundane and life </v>

3219
02:26:23.681 --> 02:26:28.240
<v Speaker 2>becomes tired and grow old in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways other than aging,</v>

3220
02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:33.460
<v Speaker 2>but the other thing that happens is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that this is what's going on and</v>

3221
02:26:33.461 --> 02:26:34.990
<v Speaker 2>then you seek novelty.</v>

3222
02:26:35.050 --> 02:26:40.050
<v Speaker 2>You seek new experiences and hopefully </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what happens to more people more.</v>

3223
02:26:40.391 --> 02:26:42.750
<v Speaker 2>When they listened to podcasts like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

3224
02:26:42.751 --> 02:26:43.584
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they hear you guys talk about your </v>

3225
02:26:44.231 --> 02:26:46.360
<v Speaker 2>experiences and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God damn it.</v>

3226
02:26:46.361 --> 02:26:47.680
<v Speaker 2>I need some of that in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3227
02:26:47.681 --> 02:26:50.860
<v Speaker 2>I need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to just go fucking camp.</v>

3228
02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:55.150

<v Speaker 2>I need to wake up and hear bulls bugling</v>

3229

<v Speaker 2>and I need to wake up and hear birds </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I don't recognize Turpin and </v>

3230

3271
02:29:07.171 --> 02:29:08.004
<v Speaker 4>Not something you get sick of hearing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never met every time I've been elk </v>

3272
02:29:11.791 --> 02:29:12.624
<v Speaker 4>hunting and I've been elk hunting a few </v>
<v Speaker 4>times now you see one and you hear it </v>

3273
02:29:15.631 --> 02:29:17.880
<v Speaker 4>and just your whole body like tingles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3274
02:29:17.881 --> 02:29:18.714
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a magical experience to just be </v>

3275
02:29:22.141 --> 02:29:24.090
<v Speaker 4>around those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to feel bad,</v>

3276
02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:27.510
<v Speaker 4>to feel that noise in your chest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jesus to the size of that fucker.</v>

3277
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:29.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

3278
02:29:31.200 --> 02:29:32.033
<v Speaker 4>I mean the things that are keeping those</v>
<v Speaker 4>things alive or the money that comes </v>

3279
02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:37.193
<v Speaker 4>from hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's super important for people to </v>

3280
02:29:38.731 --> 02:29:39.564
<v Speaker 4>recognize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a time in this country with </v>

3281
02:29:40.561 --> 02:29:43.500
<v Speaker 4>those things were almost extinct in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>early 19 hundreds.</v>

3282
02:29:43.501 --> 02:29:45.360
<v Speaker 4>There was very few.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's very few deer.</v>

3283
02:29:45.570 --> 02:29:46.403
<v Speaker 4>There's very few anything and now </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's more deer in this country than </v>

3284
02:29:48.361 --> 02:29:50.760
<v Speaker 4>the war.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Columbus didn't discover this place</v>

3285
02:29:50.850 --> 02:29:53.100
<v Speaker 4>and that's why people are so passionate </v>
<v Speaker 4>about this man.</v>

3286
02:29:53.100 --> 02:29:55.320
<v Speaker 4>Look at the history like we've landed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We said,</v>

3287
02:29:55.321 --> 02:29:57.540
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this place is going to be different than</v>

3288
02:29:57.541 --> 02:29:58.374
<v Speaker 4>where we came from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The land or the animals belong to the </v>

3289
02:30:01.291 --> 02:30:04.770
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We fucked that up real quick with market</v>

3290
02:30:04.771 --> 02:30:05.581
<v Speaker 4>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3291
02:30:05.581 --> 02:30:09.230
<v Speaker 4>Market hunting is an interesting thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that most people don't.</v>

3292
02:30:09.270 --> 02:30:10.860
<v Speaker 4>Didn't even know that that was a real </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

3293
02:30:10.861 --> 02:30:12.420
<v Speaker 4>They know that we kill off all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>buffalo,</v>

3294
02:30:12.421 --> 02:30:16.330
<v Speaker 4>but they don't really understand that </v>
<v Speaker 4>back in the day before refrigerators and</v>

3295
02:30:16.420 --> 02:30:18.540
<v Speaker 4>you got to get meat like pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 4>then.</v>

3296
02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:22.680
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a man read Michener's chesapeake,</v>

3297
02:30:23.060 --> 02:30:26.520
<v Speaker 4>that there's a great description on </v>
<v Speaker 4>market hunting in the Chesapeake Bay.</v>

3298
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:30.390
<v Speaker 4>Guys going out with a low profile boats </v>
<v Speaker 4>with cannons on them,</v>

3299
02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:33.390
<v Speaker 4>stuffing them full of shards and nails </v>
<v Speaker 4>and stuff,</v>

3300
02:30:33.391 --> 02:30:38.391
<v Speaker 4>and they'd go up to these big rafts they</v>
<v Speaker 4>called when ducks and geese sleep in the</v>

3301
02:30:39.840 --> 02:30:40.920
<v Speaker 4>middle of the night on big bodies of </v>
<v Speaker 4>water.</v>

3302
02:30:40.980 --> 02:30:45.980
<v Speaker 4>They all get huddled up together and the</v>
<v Speaker 4>on this is in the Chesapeake Bay,</v>

3303
02:30:46.650 --> 02:30:49.770
<v Speaker 4>but it happened in the Great Lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also big rafts of birds.</v>

3304
02:30:50.280 --> 02:30:52.410
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would,</v>

3305
02:30:52.600 --> 02:30:54.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push off in the middle of the night,</v>

3306
02:30:54.870 --> 02:30:55.703
<v Speaker 4>sneak up really slowly on these big </v>
<v Speaker 4>rafts of sleeping birds and touch this </v>

3307
02:30:59.941 --> 02:31:01.620
<v Speaker 4>cannon off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shoot this cannon.</v>

3308
02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:03.113
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's how the Chesapeake Bay </v>

3309
02:31:05.011 --> 02:31:05.844
<v Speaker 4>retriever was a basically bred into </v>
<v Speaker 4>existence was they needed a big hearty </v>

3310
02:31:10.501 --> 02:31:15.501
<v Speaker 4>dog that could withstand cold water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This dog would spend hours never getting</v>

3311
02:31:16.261 --> 02:31:19.470
<v Speaker 4>back in the boat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just constantly retrieving for hours</v>

3312
02:31:19.630 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 4>because they'd</v>

3313
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.910
<v Speaker 1>shoot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3314
02:31:21.240 --> 02:31:24.880
<v Speaker 1>and probably a mouthful of nails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200 birds.</v>

3315
02:31:24.900 --> 02:31:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then that dog had to then sit on the</v>

3316
02:31:28.741 --> 02:31:31.620
<v Speaker 1>pile at birds and defend it the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

3317
02:31:32.250 --> 02:31:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3318
02:31:33.030 --> 02:31:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Because those burgers are worth money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were taking them across to a.</v>

3319
02:31:36.310 --> 02:31:38.920
<v Speaker 2>So they had to be guide dogs or guard </v>
<v Speaker 2>dogs rather.</v>

3320
02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:40.930
<v Speaker 2>And they also had to be retrievers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3321
02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3322
02:31:42.640 --> 02:31:43.473
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they would bring those to </v>

3323
02:31:44.321 --> 02:31:45.154
<v Speaker 2>market by the barrel full and that's an.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were only good for a couple of </v>

3324
02:31:48.910 --> 02:31:49.600
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3325
02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:50.400
<v Speaker 2>People would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3326
02:31:50.400 --> 02:31:53.050
<v Speaker 2>they would try to keep them cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then people try to buy them as quick</v>

3327
02:31:53.051 --> 02:31:53.884
<v Speaker 2>as they could before they spoiled and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you have to go right back out and </v>

3328
02:31:55.781 --> 02:31:56.614
<v Speaker 2>do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In that process resulted in just a </v>

3329
02:31:59.230 --> 02:32:02.560
<v Speaker 2>devastation on the wildlife in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

3330
02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:03.883
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing was happening with </v>

3331
02:32:05.650 --> 02:32:07.420
<v Speaker 1>white tail deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elk,</v>

3332
02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:09.320
<v Speaker 1>black bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

3333
02:32:09.410 --> 02:32:10.243
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously,</v>

3334
02:32:10.380 --> 02:32:10.890
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

3335
02:32:10.890 --> 02:32:12.720
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the one that everybody harps on,</v>

3336
02:32:12.721 --> 02:32:15.420
<v Speaker 2>but they don't realize that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everything</v>

3337
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:19.800
<v Speaker 1>we could eat they shot and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can put a price tag on it.</v>

3338
02:32:19.801 --> 02:32:20.634
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the major issues that </v>

3339
02:32:22.470 --> 02:32:23.303
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing in Idaho is they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with some of this auction tag stuff </v>

3340
02:32:27.691 --> 02:32:30.400
<v Speaker 1>is we're starting to put a dollar amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>on our game.</v>

3341
02:32:30.401 --> 02:32:31.234
<v Speaker 1>And what do you mean by auction tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're pulling to eggs out of the </v>

3342
02:32:34.231 --> 02:32:36.240
<v Speaker 1>general pool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like right now,</v>

3343
02:32:36.330 --> 02:32:38.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say in the state,</v>

3344
02:32:38.191 --> 02:32:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3345
02:32:40.890 --> 02:32:43.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could all put in,</v>

3346
02:32:43.171 --> 02:32:45.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand people put in for a,</v>

3347
02:32:45.480 --> 02:32:50.310
<v Speaker 1>for elk tags in a prime unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unit that grows the biggest balls,</v>

3348
02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:54.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to raise more funds,</v>

3349
02:32:54.570 --> 02:32:58.500
<v Speaker 1>they started to remove one of those tags</v>
<v Speaker 1>and auction them off.</v>

3350
02:32:59.010 --> 02:33:01.630
<v Speaker 1>So that's putting a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3351
02:33:01.710 --> 02:33:05.940
<v Speaker 1>whatever we could all put in for $30 for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the remaining three elk.</v>

3352
02:33:06.450 --> 02:33:07.283
<v Speaker 1>But if we choose to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can all try to bid on each other for </v>

3353
02:33:09.721 --> 02:33:10.680
<v Speaker 1>that fourth tag.</v>

3354
02:33:10.830 --> 02:33:15.690
<v Speaker 2>So if there is a limited amount of tags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have to realize that your chances</v>

3355
02:33:15.691 --> 02:33:18.420
<v Speaker 2>of drawing that tag are probably pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>slim,</v>

3356
02:33:18.660 --> 02:33:19.493
<v Speaker 2>unless you build up points every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you build up a certain amount of points </v>

3357
02:33:21.901 --> 02:33:24.300
<v Speaker 2>in that makes it more likely that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to draw a tag.</v>

3358
02:33:24.301 --> 02:33:26.070
<v Speaker 2>So people that don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>

3359
02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:29.040
<v Speaker 2>so one person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll take one tag and they put it off</v>

3360
02:33:29.041 --> 02:33:31.890
<v Speaker 2>and they'll allow it to be auctioned off</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes they'll go for hundreds of</v>

3361
02:33:31.891 --> 02:33:33.360
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3362
02:33:33.720 --> 02:33:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Like crazy rich dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's two schools of thought.</v>

3363
02:33:36.961 --> 02:33:39.480
<v Speaker 2>One School of thought is look how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money he's going to conservation because</v>

3364
02:33:39.481 --> 02:33:41.970
<v Speaker 2>this one rich asshole that wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>spend $400,000</v>

3365
02:33:41.971 --> 02:33:42.930
<v Speaker 2>to kill a bighorn sheep.</v>

3366
02:33:43.270 --> 02:33:44.103
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think saying it like you do the </v>

3367
02:33:46.001 --> 02:33:48.460
<v Speaker 1>rich asshole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how everybody says it,</v>

3368
02:33:48.620 --> 02:33:49.453
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I get really frustrated </v>

3369
02:33:50.711 --> 02:33:52.030
<v Speaker 1>with that because I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3370
02:33:52.390 --> 02:33:57.390
<v Speaker 1>aren't we as the remaining sportsmen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this pool supporting the rich asshole by</v>

3371
02:33:59.081 --> 02:33:59.914
<v Speaker 1>giving him the ability?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't the thousand people in the </v>

3372
02:34:02.831 --> 02:34:06.460
<v Speaker 1>pool just agree to spend a couple extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>bucks on the tag?</v>

3373
02:34:06.970 --> 02:34:07.460
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

3374
02:34:07.460 --> 02:34:08.293
<v Speaker 2>that might help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is it really going to get you the </v>

3375
02:34:09.771 --> 02:34:12.050
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that one tag,</v>

3376
02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:13.513
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like without burdening the </v>

3377
02:34:15.321 --> 02:34:18.210
<v Speaker 2>regular sportsmen who doesn't want spend</v>
<v Speaker 2>like didn't</v>

3378
02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Montana like significantly raised their </v>
<v Speaker 4>tags,</v>

3379
02:34:20.750 --> 02:34:23.080
<v Speaker 4>the pricer tags recently?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of complaints.</v>

3380
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:24.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're a.</v>

3381
02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:27.540
<v Speaker 4>But they put a lot of burden on the out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of state hunter,</v>

3382
02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:28.770
<v Speaker 4>not the instate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

3383
02:34:28.890 --> 02:34:29.510
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3384
02:34:29.510 --> 02:34:31.780
<v Speaker 4>The resident hunter gets a break,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3385
02:34:31.781 --> 02:34:34.200
<v Speaker 4>They get our instate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3386
02:34:34.690 --> 02:34:35.081
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3387
02:34:35.081 --> 02:34:35.914
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I supported a tag fee increase for </v>

3388
02:34:39.101 --> 02:34:41.560
<v Speaker 4>resident hunters because we haven't had </v>
<v Speaker 4>one in a lot of years.</v>

3389
02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:45.460
<v Speaker 4>So what's a tag like an over the counter</v>
<v Speaker 4>tag for elk right now in Montana,</v>

3390
02:34:45.910 --> 02:34:46.810
<v Speaker 4>or excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Idaho,</v>

3391
02:34:47.740 --> 02:34:49.750
<v Speaker 4>I want to save 40 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Thirty five bucks.</v>

3392
02:34:49.751 --> 02:34:50.940
<v Speaker 4>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3393
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:53.440
<v Speaker 4>and I want to say Montana 17 as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>resident,</v>

3394
02:34:53.441 --> 02:34:54.274
<v Speaker 4>she knew how amazing it is there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For 17 bucks you can get 500 pounds of </v>

3395
02:34:58.601 --> 02:35:02.440
<v Speaker 4>meat and most honestly your effort to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Most hunters,</v>

3396
02:35:02.441 --> 02:35:06.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean speaking for the guys that I hang</v>
<v Speaker 4>around with and nobody else.</v>

3397
02:35:06.880 --> 02:35:09.040
<v Speaker 4>We like to drink our beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

3398
02:35:09.370 --> 02:35:10.250
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3399
02:35:10.270 --> 02:35:11.103
<v Speaker 4>and spending $17 on a case of beer that </v>
<v Speaker 4>has gone all generously say a couple of </v>

3400
02:35:17.111 --> 02:35:19.330
<v Speaker 4>weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3401
02:35:19.390 --> 02:35:22.180
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love to hunt elk and deer.</v>

3402
02:35:22.390 --> 02:35:23.680
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>

3403
02:35:24.400 --> 02:35:28.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just something that I look </v>
<v Speaker 4>forward to the year long,</v>

3404
02:35:28.970 --> 02:35:29.803
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can bury more than willing to spend </v>

3405
02:35:35.051 --> 02:35:38.980
<v Speaker 4>more than 17 bucks on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the potential.</v>

3406
02:35:39.250 --> 02:35:42.580
<v Speaker 4>The thrill of the excuse to go hunt for </v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

3407
02:35:42.640 --> 02:35:43.473
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's reasonable and that will </v>

3408
02:35:44.530 --> 02:35:45.363
<v Speaker 4>pretty much within anybody's budget.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean just raise it to 20 bucks and </v>

3409
02:35:48.131 --> 02:35:48.964
<v Speaker 4>then all that money is going to go back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the state and it's going to help and </v>

3410
02:35:52.031 --> 02:35:53.470
<v Speaker 4>it's still very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

3411
02:35:53.471 --> 02:35:56.190
<v Speaker 4>very reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Collectively say,</v>

3412
02:35:56.200 --> 02:35:57.033
<v Speaker 4>I mean it reasonably don't know the </v>
<v Speaker 4>exact price generally because you can </v>

3413
02:35:59.141 --> 02:36:01.950
<v Speaker 4>buy a sportsman's package.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's 100 and I don't know,</v>

3414
02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:02.770
<v Speaker 4>$5.</v>

3415
02:36:02.770 --> 02:36:03.603
<v Speaker 4>You can hunt and fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like basically anything that's not a </v>

3416
02:36:07.571 --> 02:36:08.404
<v Speaker 4>draw everything over the counter as long</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you don't go over the limit of what </v>

3417
02:36:10.691 --> 02:36:11.890
<v Speaker 4>you could get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty much,</v>

3418
02:36:11.891 --> 02:36:13.140
<v Speaker 4>I mean pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3419
02:36:13.150 --> 02:36:14.890
<v Speaker 4>And Idaho's a true lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3420
02:36:14.980 --> 02:36:17.610
<v Speaker 4>So there are no points.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3421
02:36:17.611 --> 02:36:19.240
<v Speaker 4>it's one of those dates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

3422
02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:20.113
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I truly like because it spreads out </v>

3423
02:36:22.420 --> 02:36:26.350
<v Speaker 4>the pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So our draw odds are fantastic.</v>

3424
02:36:26.590 --> 02:36:29.560
<v Speaker 4>So now we're where someone wants to </v>
<v Speaker 4>auction those things off,</v>

3425
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:30.423
<v Speaker 4>like what is a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one of those crazy elk tag because </v>

3426
02:36:32.141 --> 02:36:34.090
<v Speaker 4>I know that wild sheep is the big one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3427
02:36:34.091 --> 02:36:36.640
<v Speaker 4>Like bighorn sheep are the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people spend it for three.</v>

3428
02:36:36.641 --> 02:36:37.720
<v Speaker 4>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was?</v>

3429
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:42.580
<v Speaker 4>Three hundred and $5,000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at the same an elk tag a sheep while</v>

3430
02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:43.660
<v Speaker 4>for shakes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Syria that,</v>

3431
02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:44.653
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we hunted that I think last year </v>

3432
02:36:46.781 --> 02:36:50.290
<v Speaker 4>went for over half a million,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to keep in sheep.</v>

3433
02:36:51.160 --> 02:36:51.993
<v Speaker 4>Sheep are the rarest thing that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're doing really well in the </v>

3434
02:36:57.250 --> 02:37:01.060
<v Speaker 4>areas that they're doing well in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then the brakes,</v>

3435
02:37:01.061 --> 02:37:03.580
<v Speaker 4>we saw a ton of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy everywhere,</v>

3436
02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:04.590
<v Speaker 4>but disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3437
02:37:04.680 --> 02:37:07.880
<v Speaker 4>they're super susceptible to disease,</v>
<v Speaker 4>domestic sheep diseases.</v>

3438
02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:10.390
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because there was a sitcom of video,</v>

3439
02:37:10.391 --> 02:37:11.650
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they did.</v>

3440
02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:14.880
<v Speaker 4>They did those short film about the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3441
02:37:15.470 --> 02:37:16.303
<v Speaker 4>door</v>

3442
02:37:16.350 --> 02:37:18.110
<v Speaker 2>I heard is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you say it?</v>

3443
02:37:18.170 --> 02:37:20.370
<v Speaker 2>T e n d e r o y,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3444
02:37:20.410 --> 02:37:21.243
<v Speaker 2>tenderloin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these sheep are suffering from </v>

3445
02:37:24.501 --> 02:37:26.690
<v Speaker 2>diseases that are coming from domestic </v>
<v Speaker 2>sheep.</v>

3446
02:37:26.691 --> 02:37:27.524
<v Speaker 2>So they're trying to figure out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>breed a domestic sheep that doesn't </v>

3447
02:37:31.551 --> 02:37:32.384
<v Speaker 2>catch this disease so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>reintroduce healthy sheep into these </v>

3448
02:37:36.261 --> 02:37:41.210
<v Speaker 2>areas and not have them be infected by </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different diseases.</v>

3449
02:37:41.211 --> 02:37:43.160
<v Speaker 2>They get some really fascinating stuff.</v>

3450
02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember a kit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fischer was on that hunt with us,</v>

3451
02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:47.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the breaks,</v>

3452
02:37:47.141 --> 02:37:48.310
<v Speaker 1>he was Rowan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the boats,</v>

3453
02:37:48.670 --> 02:37:49.503
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he works for National Wildlife </v>

3454
02:37:51.310 --> 02:37:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Federation and that's when he does is he</v>
<v Speaker 1>does conflict mitigation basically.</v>

3455
02:37:55.451 --> 02:37:56.284
<v Speaker 1>So he identifies those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a grazing allotments and most women are </v>

3456
02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:02.740
<v Speaker 1>on public land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3457
02:38:03.370 --> 02:38:04.203
<v Speaker 1>and he identifies the conflict or </v>
<v Speaker 1>grazing allotments mostly for bighorn </v>

3458
02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:09.813
<v Speaker 1>sheep that could put domestic sheep that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could potentially be carrying diseases </v>

3459
02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:18.490
<v Speaker 1>in contact with these wild cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's looking to,</v>

3460
02:38:18.760 --> 02:38:19.593
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically pay the rancher that has that </v>

3461
02:38:21.701 --> 02:38:26.701
<v Speaker 1>grazing allotment fair market value for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that grazing allotment and he just turns</v>

3462
02:38:28.181 --> 02:38:31.540
<v Speaker 1>it back over to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US forest service.</v>

3463
02:38:31.640 --> 02:38:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And that's a real issue with buffalo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

3464
02:38:33.891 --> 02:38:34.724
<v Speaker 2>with wild bison because there's two </v>
<v Speaker 2>schools of thought and there's one </v>

3465
02:38:37.941 --> 02:38:38.774
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about Brucellosis and that </v>

3466
02:38:40.101 --> 02:38:44.450
<v Speaker 2>brucellosis will somehow or another be </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmitted from the bison to cattle.</v>

3467
02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:45.713
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but apparently a lot of people say that </v>

3468
02:38:48.741 --> 02:38:49.574
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of a bullshit argument </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's really about the bison </v>

3469
02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:55.760
<v Speaker 2>eating up all the grazing land and </v>
<v Speaker 2>forcing out the domestic cattle.</v>

3470
02:38:55.850 --> 02:38:56.683
<v Speaker 2>So they using the brucellosis as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse to say that this is the reason </v>

3471
02:39:00.951 --> 02:39:03.110
<v Speaker 2>why we need to kill off the bias and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>them out of the way.</v>

3472
02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:05.360
<v Speaker 2>I think there's some legitimate little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of on both sides.</v>

3473
02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:06.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

3474
02:39:06.171 --> 02:39:10.780
<v Speaker 1>and the difference between the sheep and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sheep don't carry a disease.</v>

3475
02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Bison definitely do carry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3476
02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:15.820
<v Speaker 1>the brucellosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But domestic sheep do carry.</v>

3477
02:39:15.821 --> 02:39:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Some domestic sheep do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the wild ones,</v>

3478
02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:18.993
<v Speaker 1>the wild wild ones don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they can catch domestic sheep and </v>

3479
02:39:21.790 --> 02:39:24.590
<v Speaker 1>they have no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't find the immune systems.</v>

3480
02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:26.440
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

3481
02:39:26.441 --> 02:39:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the Bison one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3482
02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:30.273
<v Speaker 1>I got a big eastern Montana family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a lot of ground to grow beef </v>

3483
02:39:34.001 --> 02:39:35.830
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that's your livelihood,</v>

3484
02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:36.970
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3485
02:39:37.270 --> 02:39:38.103
<v Speaker 1>putting more animals on the countryside </v>
<v Speaker 1>and some fucking hulk bison thing way </v>

3486
02:39:43.361 --> 02:39:44.194
<v Speaker 1>bigger than a cat man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to directly impact your </v>

3487
02:39:47.081 --> 02:39:47.914
<v Speaker 1>livelihood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think just as we were talking </v>

3488
02:39:49.301 --> 02:39:50.820
<v Speaker 1>about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3489
02:39:50.830 --> 02:39:54.220
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some happy medium there and if,</v>

3490
02:39:54.340 --> 02:39:56.680
<v Speaker 1>especially if we're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3491
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:57.663
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of this oil and gas stuff that's </v>

3492
02:39:58.751 --> 02:39:59.584
<v Speaker 1>getting scary right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like especially with like all of a </v>

3493
02:40:03.191 --> 02:40:06.130
<v Speaker 1>sudden we're saying that you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to clean up after yourself after he had,</v>

3494
02:40:06.660 --> 02:40:09.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started a big mind somewhere,</v>

3495
02:40:09.370 --> 02:40:10.203
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I would much rather have bison out </v>

3496
02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 1>than</v>

3497
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:14.813
<v Speaker 4>like let's raise funds through sports </v>
<v Speaker 4>minor recreational than digging a big </v>

3498
02:40:19.291 --> 02:40:23.070
<v Speaker 4>pit in a beautiful spot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know if that's going to cover</v>

3499
02:40:23.071 --> 02:40:23.904
<v Speaker 4>it though to play with the Dakota </v>
<v Speaker 4>pipeline liquid they're talking about </v>

3500
02:40:26.221 --> 02:40:27.054
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like the amount of money </v>

3501
02:40:28.231 --> 02:40:30.810
<v Speaker 4>that's going to come from that is just </v>
<v Speaker 4>staggering.</v>

3502
02:40:31.200 --> 02:40:32.033
<v Speaker 4>And so the amount of pressure that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in making something like that </v>

3503
02:40:34.231 --> 02:40:37.710
<v Speaker 4>go through is also pretty staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

3504
02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:40.980
<v Speaker 4>but it's dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3505
02:40:40.981 --> 02:40:41.814
<v Speaker 4>and what the disaster that could take </v>
<v Speaker 4>place is you can't put a price on it </v>

3506
02:40:46.530 --> 02:40:47.260
<v Speaker 4>because what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3507
02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:49.440
<v Speaker 4>what could be done if they ruin a river </v>
<v Speaker 4>system,</v>

3508
02:40:49.890 --> 02:40:54.690
<v Speaker 4>if somehow or another this gas line </v>
<v Speaker 4>breaks and you have oil flooding a river</v>

3509
02:40:54.691 --> 02:40:59.640
<v Speaker 4>system the same way they had that bp oil</v>
<v Speaker 4>rig disaster out in the Gulf.</v>

3510
02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:01.810
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could you imagine that?</v>

3511
02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:02.970
<v Speaker 4>Still dealing with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3512
02:41:03.030 --> 02:41:03.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3513
02:41:03.360 --> 02:41:04.590
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>

3514
02:41:04.591 --> 02:41:06.000
<v Speaker 4>And how about the people that had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal with it?</v>

3515
02:41:06.001 --> 02:41:08.220
<v Speaker 4>There were living near there that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>sick,</v>

3516
02:41:08.700 --> 02:41:09.533
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of diseases and </v>

3517
02:41:10.291 --> 02:41:13.680
<v Speaker 4>there's all sorts of lawsuits going on </v>
<v Speaker 4>and all the cleanup crews.</v>

3518
02:41:13.681 --> 02:41:14.514
<v Speaker 4>I mean they had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they made prisoners clean up the </v>

3519
02:41:16.021 --> 02:41:16.854
<v Speaker 4>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the BP mass and there's a lot of weird </v>

3520
02:41:18.571 --> 02:41:20.100
<v Speaker 4>shit involved in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3521
02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:21.150
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3522
02:41:21.150 --> 02:41:24.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm truly not educated on the economics </v>
<v Speaker 4>of it and my,</v>

3523
02:41:24.661 --> 02:41:26.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my brain says that no,</v>

3524
02:41:26.980 --> 02:41:27.810
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3525
02:41:27.810 --> 02:41:31.060
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was no warm fuzzy eco,</v>

3526
02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:32.893
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lodge that we could set up that would </v>

3527
02:41:34.440 --> 02:41:36.010
<v Speaker 4>match the funds from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3528
02:41:36.300 --> 02:41:37.540
<v Speaker 4>oil and gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

3529
02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:38.400
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3530
02:41:38.400 --> 02:41:42.330
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to think longterm and </v>
<v Speaker 4>boy,</v>

3531
02:41:43.020 --> 02:41:47.780
<v Speaker 4>it just wrecked that landscape and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>landscape is what I've been in love with</v>

3532
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:49.500
<v Speaker 4>since a little kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>

3533
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:51.960
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then nobody wants to be able to let your</v>

3534
02:41:51.961 --> 02:41:53.320
<v Speaker 4>toilet water on fire either.</v>

3535
02:41:54.010 --> 02:41:54.843
<v Speaker 4>You ever see those fucking gasland </v>
<v Speaker 4>documentary is coming right out of the </v>

3536
02:41:57.451 --> 02:41:58.284
<v Speaker 4>tap and they guys sticks a lighter to it</v>
<v Speaker 4>and was fucking water's on fire and </v>

3537
02:42:01.381 --> 02:42:03.110
<v Speaker 4>people are both labeled supplementing </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we'll do.</v>

3538
02:42:03.540 --> 02:42:06.000
<v Speaker 4>That's always been the case.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not with these fucking people,</v>

3539
02:42:06.380 --> 02:42:08.430
<v Speaker 4>but these fucking people is directly </v>
<v Speaker 4>related to fracking.</v>

3540
02:42:08.431 --> 02:42:10.170
<v Speaker 4>Like just all these apologists for that </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

3541
02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:11.033
<v Speaker 4>It's like how many fucking earthquakes </v>
<v Speaker 4>needed to have an Oklahoma before you </v>

3542
02:42:14.161 --> 02:42:14.791
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

3543
02:42:14.791 --> 02:42:16.800
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is this okay?</v>

3544
02:42:16.801 --> 02:42:17.634

02:42:20.401 --> 02:42:24.990
<v Speaker 4>as long as it's under a thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at as long as we only like</v>

3548
02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:28.710
<v Speaker 4>pollute like three or four wells a year.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We got plenty of bottled water,</v>

3550
02:42:32.070 --> 02:42:32.903
<v Speaker 4>but it's constantly evolving thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Technology all across the board is </v>

<v Speaker 4>way better.</v>

3553
02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:43.230
<v Speaker 4>We know way more about these migration </v>
<v Speaker 4>routes and we used to,</v>

3554
02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:48.500
<v Speaker 4>we know way intact migration routes are </v>
<v Speaker 4>what we need for healthy mule deer.</v>

<v Speaker 4>how far mule deer travel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3560
02:42:58.910 --> 02:43:01.560
<v Speaker 4>We have a deer in our unit that migrate </v>
<v Speaker 4>170 miles.</v>

3561
02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:03.310
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

<v Speaker 4>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight feet of snow on the ground.</v>

3567
02:43:11.201 --> 02:43:11.980

<v Speaker 2>direct correlation between the amount of</v>

3584
02:44:11.381 --> 02:44:12.214
<v Speaker 2>footsteps people take per minute and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>population that they're in and also the </v>

<v Speaker 2>faster they talk they.</v>

3586
02:44:19.750 --> 02:44:23.470
<v Speaker 2>If the population is higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will say their syllables faster.</v>

3587
02:44:23.740 --> 02:44:26.740
<v Speaker 2>That will say words faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say more words in a minute.</v>
