1
00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>Should I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I do headphones?</v>

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:04.190
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.820
<v Speaker 1>like headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of hate hearing myself that way.</v>

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did you hear yourself?</v>

5
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you try to pull this sucker up like </v>
<v Speaker 1>about a fist from your face?</v>

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.153
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

7
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It's been a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been.</v>

8
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy like you.</v>

9
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>It's always nice to see you're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

10
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember best to get tired of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing shit like that?</v>

11
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.471
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

12
00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:23.304
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you get tired of the weirdness of </v>

13
00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>like interviewing with people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

14
00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:29.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you could die.</v>

15
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 1>Is this scary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

16
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all right though.</v>

17
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing.</v>

18
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>

19
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.103
<v Speaker 1>A tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the film we've been doing q and a's </v>

20
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:36.774
<v Speaker 1>every night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the same questions from the </v>

21
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>audience all the time and part of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is tiring,</v>

22
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:40.614
<v Speaker 1>but then part of it like people ask some</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions because they're obvious </v>

23
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>because everybody wants to know the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and I'm like,</v>

24
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.344
<v Speaker 1>I understand that one of the weirdest </v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the film is when they're </v>

25
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:54.291
<v Speaker 1>showing all the guys who have died from </v>
<v Speaker 1>free soloing and they're actually.</v>

26
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>They didn't all die free soloing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

27
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.813
<v Speaker 1>that's actually one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the only thing that I </v>

28
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 1>take slight issue with a film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly hyperbolic [inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>The two of them died base jumping and </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of them died rope jumping.</v>

30
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>They were all were free solos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of what the film is saying</v>

31
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>that they're all free solis who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>

32
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>but they all died in the mountains doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain related extreme activities,</v>

33
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.663
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

34
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make the story is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like poetic license.</v>

35
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got sneaky.</v>

36
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean they all were free solace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

38
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>that's not the same though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

39
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

40
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I preferred it.</v>

41
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>The other way to look at it is the no </v>
<v Speaker 1>free solis has ever died doing anything.</v>

42
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:35.664
<v Speaker 1>Cutting edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite statistic that I'm </v>

43
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>like no free solos has ever died doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard solar.</v>

44
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Like basically free a few free solos </v>
<v Speaker 1>have died falling off at easy turn or </v>

45
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>just falling off sort of routine or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

46
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just falling off the mountain,</v>

47
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>but none of them have ever died while </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something,</v>

48
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.344
<v Speaker 1>cutting edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that had never been done </v>

49
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that was you hardcore.</v>

50
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.903
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's because when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something that's a little bit </v>

51
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>easier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you relax.</v>

52
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.033
<v Speaker 1>I think that's probably part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also I think part of it is just a </v>

53
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:04.704
<v Speaker 1>numbers thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spend so much time doing easy stuff </v>

54
00:02:05.911 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>and so little time doing really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that,</v>

55
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just statistics.</v>

56
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>

57
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.883
<v Speaker 1>how important is it when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you were free soloing to have that </v>

58
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>edge to be like really cognizant about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how intense this is?</v>

59
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Like if you got to calm to relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

60
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>I think that's.</v>

61
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that is kind of the concern for </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

62
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've noticed that in for myself anyway,</v>

63
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.593
<v Speaker 1>and I try not to do very much easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>soloing anymore because there is a </v>

64
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>certain complacency that overtime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>you just do so much mileage on easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrain and then you're like,</v>

66
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>this is so easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is so easy.</v>

67
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 1>And then you slip and you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.233
<v Speaker 1>fighters look at things that way too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they at a certain point in their </v>

70
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want easy fights because they</v>

71
00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>need to get challenged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise they won't train properly.</v>

72
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.430
<v Speaker 1>And then they wind up losing to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

73
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you should take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Well the difference between a fighter </v>
<v Speaker 1>say</v>

75
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 2>when they're not trained in not in camp </v>
<v Speaker 2>and just their skill and what their body</v>

76
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 2>can do without,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without going through a camp is probably</v>

77
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:12.661
<v Speaker 2>only like 70 percent of what they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they actually go through everything</v>

78
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 2>with full intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight weeks,</v>

79
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 2>two times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

80
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 2>physical therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massage,</v>

81
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>visualization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conditioning,</v>

82
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:26.374
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the things that make them who they </v>

83
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 2>are the day they step into the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you free Solo.</v>

84
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 3>It's funny that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's,</v>

85
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.993
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you saw the film and that's </v>

86
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 3>all a exactly the level of preparation </v>
<v Speaker 3>that went into it.</v>

87
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.720
<v Speaker 2>Do you take time off before a big free </v>
<v Speaker 2>solo?</v>

88
00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Do you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just kind of the opposite.</v>

89
00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:44.920
<v Speaker 2>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

90
00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.120
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of ramping up to it.</v>

91
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you,</v>

92
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.573
<v Speaker 2>is there any concern that maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't given yourself enough </v>

93
00:03:52.191 --> 00:03:55.100
<v Speaker 2>recuperative time like that for the day </v>
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>

94
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.870
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so for me anyway,</v>

95
00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:57.704
<v Speaker 3>it was always sort of the opposite </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the real challenge of free </v>

96
00:03:59.191 --> 00:04:01.250
<v Speaker 3>soloing is the psychological side of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>mental side of it.</v>

97
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.343
<v Speaker 3>It's not so much the physical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I don't necessarily have to </v>

98
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.730
<v Speaker 3>physically perform at the absolute limit</v>
<v Speaker 3>of what I'm capable of,</v>

99
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.040
<v Speaker 3>but I have to mentally perform at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

100
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.233
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the mental side of it comes so much </v>

101
00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Speaker 3>from confidence and feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

102
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:17.390
<v Speaker 3>feeling prepared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I don't know.</v>

103
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.070
<v Speaker 3>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I freestyle it all cap,</v>

104
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 3>I kind of knew that I wasn't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

105
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.650
<v Speaker 3>like I'd probably already started to </v>
<v Speaker 3>decline a little bit physically over the</v>

106
00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:25.484
<v Speaker 3>course of the season because the two </v>
<v Speaker 3>months in the seventies just kind of </v>

107
00:04:26.811 --> 00:04:27.644
<v Speaker 3>grueling on her body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it all the time I spent going up </v>

108
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:30.950
<v Speaker 3>and down on the wall and preparing.</v>

109
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.060
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very tiring.</v>

110
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 3>And so I kind of realized that I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to get sort of deeply fatigued.</v>

111
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 3>I was sort of a week away from having </v>
<v Speaker 3>started a slump,</v>

112
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.590
<v Speaker 3>a black girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kinda pooped.</v>

113
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is I knew that that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because of all that preparation,</v>

114
00:04:44.061 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychologically I was as,</v>

115
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.313
<v Speaker 3>as good as I was ever going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So even if I was physically starting to </v>

116
00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:50.000
<v Speaker 3>be a little bit tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like time to,</v>

117
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of the different curves.</v>

118
00:04:53.031 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 3>You have to hit it right at the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

119
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.583
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is your psychological preparation just </v>

120
00:04:57.211 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 2>you getting your mind into it or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like specific techniques you use or</v>

121
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:06.210
<v Speaker 2>a form of meditation or anything that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you specifically concentrate on?</v>

122
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.100
<v Speaker 2>When you're visualizing success or</v>

123
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.053
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's not even necessarily </v>

124
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:14.130
<v Speaker 3>visualizing success or it's visualizing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me it's visualizing the experience,</v>

125
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.173
<v Speaker 3>like sort of imagining what everything </v>
<v Speaker 3>will feel like imagining what it would </v>

126
00:05:17.191 --> 00:05:19.410
<v Speaker 3>like to place my foot on a hold or what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

127
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.650
<v Speaker 3>grabbing like the sensations of it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the exposure of it.</v>

128
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

129
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 3>thinking through what it'll feel like </v>
<v Speaker 3>with so much air around me and no rope.</v>

130
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.140
<v Speaker 3>Just that basically to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing is surprising when I get there</v>

131
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.360
<v Speaker 2>to my hands are sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just talking to you.</v>

132
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Feel that,</v>

133
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.610
<v Speaker 2>feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking gross.</v>

134
00:05:37.611 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a clam.</v>

135
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.850
<v Speaker 2>I realized it like when I'm talking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

136
00:05:40.851 --> 00:05:43.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about you doing this and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands started sweating.</v>

137
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 2>You start thinking about thousands of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>or in your life.</v>

138
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Start thinking about chalk and powder </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that shit like that.</v>

139
00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:52.243
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever gone to like a sports </v>

140
00:05:57.591 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 2>psychologist</v>

141
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.610
<v Speaker 1>or have you ever actively tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinate a program for mental training</v>

142
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

143
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.121
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:06:08.121 --> 00:06:08.954
<v Speaker 1>so with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with reselling ocap I found that I </v>

145
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:16.580
<v Speaker 1>needed to create enough space for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not so much mental training but um,</v>

146
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.473
<v Speaker 1>but create enough empty time so that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a so that I was able to sort of </v>

147
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:21.860
<v Speaker 1>process so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

148
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I like stopped shooting an email.</v>

149
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:25.514
<v Speaker 1>I raised my social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sort of freedom my life and then </v>

150
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 1>actually my girlfriend left for the sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the week ahead of time,</v>

151
00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>so that was just totally by myself and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my van with nothing going on,</v>

152
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>like no distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not exactly,</v>

153
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental training,</v>

154
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:38.774
<v Speaker 1>but it was giving myself the free time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I could just sit around and think </v>

155
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:42.471
<v Speaker 1>about things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

156
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I can process it in my own terms in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>own time.</v>

157
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.940
<v Speaker 1>When was the last time we talked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many years ago?</v>

158
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>It was so long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it was at least for right?</v>

159
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like six or seven.</v>

160
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.430
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like 2012 or something.</v>

161
00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.413
<v Speaker 1>During that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much has changed in your life in </v>

162
00:06:58.791 --> 00:06:59.624
<v Speaker 1>terms of the way people perceive what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do and the amount of attention that </v>

163
00:07:03.291 --> 00:07:04.124
<v Speaker 1>you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that having that alone </v>

164
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:08.460
<v Speaker 1>time now you as much harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

166
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

167
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've tried to not let my life get</v>

168
00:07:12.711 --> 00:07:14.900
<v Speaker 1>busy over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just sort of naturally happens.</v>

169
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would success?</v>

170
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

171
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Just some one more times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be.</v>

172
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>When I was reached out to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reached out to you a couple of times,</v>

173
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is probably getting fucked with</v>

174
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.233
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

175
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.073
<v Speaker 1>Like someone's probably always poking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and you're just trying to get a </v>

176
00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>foothold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like literally just trying to hold on.</v>

177
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.073
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

178
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

179
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate all the opportunities that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have now and you know,</v>

180
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy with the way my life has </v>

181
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:40.424
<v Speaker 1>changed over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly when I look back at 10 or </v>

182
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 1>12 years ago when I was just a single 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>year old man living in a car,</v>

183
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 1>like I had nothing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

184
00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.031
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>if I had like one interview in a month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

186
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a big month for media,</v>

187
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then now on the film tour,</v>

188
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.053
<v Speaker 1>it's like completely outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's totally the other end of the </v>

189
00:07:59.031 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Speaker 1>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you do in this film to uh,</v>

190
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.960
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when does the film actually come out?</v>

191
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Films like out.</v>

192
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>It's in theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I couldn't go see right now.</v>

193
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 1>But you can't get it on itunes yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>

194
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.560
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

195
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>so it did a month of festival circuit </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

196
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier in the end of the summer and </v>

197
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:16.760
<v Speaker 1>then it came out in theaters at the end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of September.</v>

198
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 1>So right now I think this weekend is its</v>
<v Speaker 1>widest release.</v>

199
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:21.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like 400 theaters all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country are now.</v>

200
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

201
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.850
<v Speaker 1>and then in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

202
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 1>it's through national geographic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think it'll be on television,</v>

203
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>on the channel at some point and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually it'll stream somewhere.</v>

204
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it strange all this attention?</v>

205
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

206
00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:36.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

207
00:08:36.111 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>It's in some ways it's a natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>extension of all the stuff I've had over</v>

208
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:40.461
<v Speaker 1>the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>like having a 60 minutes piece and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago was a bit of a,</v>

210
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:44.623
<v Speaker 1>it was a flurry of attention and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of sort of prepared me in </v>

211
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:49.340
<v Speaker 1>some ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

212
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

213
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've dealt with this your whole life.</v>

214
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

215
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:54.340
<v Speaker 1>but I'm asking like an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>But I feel like it comes with what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in show business.</v>

217
00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:00.960
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

218
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.760
<v Speaker 1>That's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

219
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 1>you're a climber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

220
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.830
<v Speaker 1>And the most radical kind of climber </v>
<v Speaker 1>free solo you think when I think of what</v>

221
00:09:10.771 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of quiet tension.</v>

222
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

223
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.470
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

224
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.313
<v Speaker 1>Because it should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be sort of meditative and </v>

225
00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>relaxing and quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then obviously you're also sometimes</v>

226
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:23.270
<v Speaker 1>straining your entire body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 1>like trying very hard physically and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

228
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.503
<v Speaker 1>Well I remember one of the things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>said to me the last time we talked was </v>

229
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 1>that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very mellow because if it ever gets</v>

230
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>intense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's gone wrong.</v>

231
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:37.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

232
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>I still feel exactly the same way.</v>

233
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

234
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 1>that's always the challenge is to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

235
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 1>keep it relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for a guy like you,</v>

236
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:49.360
<v Speaker 1>my perception of a guy like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's that?</v>

237
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:54.380
<v Speaker 1>That person who's doing that activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>than to sort of juxtapose that with this</v>

238
00:09:56.610 --> 00:10:01.610
<v Speaker 1>media tour type environment and dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all these people that,</v>

239
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me like it would be really</v>

240
00:10:04.051 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

241
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:07.464
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very different than my normal </v>

242
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.530
<v Speaker 1>normal lifestyle I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

243
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:11.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of an adventure and it's an </v>

244
00:10:12.251 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>experience in its own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

245
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>I've been kind of calling it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>expedition film tour because a,</v>

246
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.240
<v Speaker 1>I've done a lot of expeditions in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

247
00:10:18.241 --> 00:10:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Like last winter I went to Antarctica </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a month and,</v>

248
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>and it's not exactly the type of climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that normally do and I don't really like</v>

249
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:24.990
<v Speaker 1>being cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sort of like,</v>

250
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.270
<v Speaker 1>oh it a once in a lifetime opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go somewhere,</v>

251
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like going to Mars or something.</v>

252
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 1>It was this totally outrageous </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

253
00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:31.254
<v Speaker 1>We're climbing big rock walls and in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>article you're just living on the </v>

254
00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:35.640
<v Speaker 1>glacier and it's totally different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally crazy.</v>

255
00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:36.940
<v Speaker 1>He camped out on a glacier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

256
00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're just in a tent on a glacier for a </v>

257
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.050
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you do that,</v>

258
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.670
<v Speaker 1>how thick a pad do you use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A really thick and a very,</v>

259
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:47.000
<v Speaker 1>very thick sleeping bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever get warm?</v>

260
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:47.541
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

261
00:10:47.541 --> 00:10:48.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

262
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.151
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Your Sleep Med.</v>

263
00:10:49.151 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a negative 40 degree sleeping bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

264
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good job but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

265
00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that kind of experience,</v>

266
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.063
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some ways it's very comparable to a </v>

267
00:10:56.821 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>film to where I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be a once in a lifetime</v>

268
00:10:58.651 --> 00:10:59.790
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just embrace it.</v>

269
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>You go with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:03.480
<v Speaker 1>it's different than the way you normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose to live your life,</v>

271
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:04.710
<v Speaker 1>but that kind of makes it understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 1>it's something new.</v>

273
00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can imagine it would be very </v>

274
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:11.550
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Antarctica thing sounds like a trip.</v>

275
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:15.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like were you traveling on uh,</v>

276
00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>established corridor?</v>

277
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:18.081
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

278
00:11:18.081 --> 00:11:19.360
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what.</v>

279
00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>So some people had climbed in the region</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

280
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.074
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we actually did tons of first </v>

281
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>ascents like roots and summits that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been climbed.</v>

282
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

283
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.680
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you do something like that,</v>

284
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 1>do you map it out in advance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

285
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:31.951
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

286
00:11:31.951 --> 00:11:34.140
<v Speaker 1>not really because I mean they're photos</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

287
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 1>of the formations and people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

288
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:38.350
<v Speaker 1>it climbed some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

289
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.310
<v Speaker 1>some Norwegians had sort of pioneered </v>
<v Speaker 1>the area and written a book about it,</v>

290
00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:42.563
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then it's not until you get there </v>

291
00:11:44.131 --> 00:11:46.620
<v Speaker 1>that you can really decide what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to climb and how it looks.</v>

292
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:47.454
<v Speaker 1>I mean ultimately you have to look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rock and see if it's climate </v>

293
00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 1>bowling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you basically just have to ski up and</v>

294
00:11:50.341 --> 00:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>then touch it and see what you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then try to climate you ski up where</v>

295
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.000
<v Speaker 1>you are because you're living on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>glacier.</v>

296
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to ski everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

297
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.050
<v Speaker 1>It was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a,</v>

298
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I did a month wearing only ski boots or </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate shoes.</v>

299
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:03.640
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>

300
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.520
<v Speaker 1>or my bedroom slippers are on camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you feet feel like?</v>

301
00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:07.903
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in a really thick socks and then </v>

302
00:12:10.541 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>keeping everything as warm as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

303
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.290
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're in climate.</v>

304
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Jews in Antarctica goes pretty chilly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

305
00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:18.933
<v Speaker 1>Actually there's a film about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming out in a couple of weeks I think </v>

306
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.630
<v Speaker 1>as part of the real rocky or it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big climbing film festival thing or film</v>

307
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>tour that sort of shows around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

308
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.430
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like a 40 minute short.</v>

309
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:32.890
<v Speaker 1>They're 30 minutes short.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually,</v>

310
00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:33.724
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those shoes that you wear on a </v>

311
00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:40.400
<v Speaker 1>normal climb are very flexible with </v>
<v Speaker 1>those last sportiva yeah,</v>

312
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.300
<v Speaker 1>that's what I said.</v>

313
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

314
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:42.653
<v Speaker 1>they're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost look like a sock with a </v>

315
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:47.240
<v Speaker 1>rubber bottom to it where you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>really kind of grip.</v>

316
00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:49.750
<v Speaker 1>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some are super soft like that.</v>

317
00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:50.613
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you're trying to </v>

318
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:51.934
<v Speaker 1>climb that summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really rigid so that you can step on a </v>

319
00:12:53.201 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 1>really small holes and it supports your </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>

320
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.273
<v Speaker 1>So like what I was wearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free soloing El cap is quite rigid </v>

321
00:12:58.451 --> 00:12:59.380
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a board,</v>

322
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:01.630
<v Speaker 1>like a platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that you can put just the tip of your</v>

323
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:04.000
<v Speaker 1>toe on something really small and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused to stay,</v>

324
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:07.250
<v Speaker 1>stay flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>welcome mountaineering type of.</v>

325
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

326
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but still also very precise because </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountaineering boot,</v>

327
00:13:10.631 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>you think clunky and big climbing shoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a ballet slipper,</v>

328
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 1>like precise and tight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then also rigid sometimes.</v>

329
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then also,</v>

330
00:13:19.211 --> 00:13:20.044
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

331
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.033
<v Speaker 1>when you're climbing cracks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put your foot into the crack and </v>

332
00:13:22.061 --> 00:13:24.160
<v Speaker 1>then torque it sideways to like lock it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into place.</v>

333
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.070
<v Speaker 1>And so the stiffer the shoe is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more it can,</v>

334
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more that you can lock the shoe into</v>

335
00:13:30.011 --> 00:13:31.090
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pose your foot.</v>

336
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:32.510
<v Speaker 1>You basically have to use fewer muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

337
00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:33.344
<v Speaker 1>when are you starting a trend?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there other people that are </v>

338
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:38.440
<v Speaker 1>following you footsteps now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

339
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably.</v>

340
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

341
00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.030
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you honestly think though.</v>

342
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's probably some people </v>

343
00:13:44.831 --> 00:13:49.090
<v Speaker 1>that look at what you're doing and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>young kids that think it must be,</v>

344
00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:50.673
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think most people look at </v>

345
00:13:52.691 --> 00:13:55.360
<v Speaker 1>the path that the average person takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in life,</v>

346
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:56.250
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

347
00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.200
<v Speaker 1>sell cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be an insurance guy,</v>

348
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 1>and they look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at it like it's death for.</v>

349
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:02.224
<v Speaker 1>They look at a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a young kid who's like enjoying playing </v>

350
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:06.544
<v Speaker 1>with his friends or doing sports or </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing video games or reading comic </v>

351
00:14:10.421 --> 00:14:15.421
<v Speaker 1>books and then you look at what could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average path that the average person</v>

352
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:17.374
<v Speaker 1>takes in life and sitting in an office </v>
<v Speaker 1>all day under fluorescent lights and it </v>

353
00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:21.280
<v Speaker 1>looks like death.</v>

354
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.500
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a slow aching death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then I look at someone like you.</v>

355
00:14:26.501 --> 00:14:26.951
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

356
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:27.784
<v Speaker 1>this guy is living a special life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a special life was so ideally </v>

357
00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:31.864
<v Speaker 1>though somebody would look at it and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is somebody living a very </v>

358
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>intentional life or having chosen a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain path,</v>

359
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily free selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would love to inspire people to</v>

360
00:14:40.751 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>live an intentional life that they care </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

361
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily feel like people </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to go free solar.</v>

362
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that's.</v>

363
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:51.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good way of putting.</v>

364
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Speaker 1>Because I think you most</v>

365
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.110
<v Speaker 2>certainly have influenced people in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>regard,</v>

366
00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.393
<v Speaker 2>but I think also people must be </v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced in the sense that they see </v>

367
00:14:59.871 --> 00:15:04.871
<v Speaker 2>where you're doing is man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's moments that you must experience</v>

368
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.240
<v Speaker 2>while you are climbing these incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>faces that are kind of magical.</v>

369
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 2>When you're up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a thousand feet up there.</v>

370
00:15:14.031 --> 00:15:14.864
<v Speaker 2>The view is fucking spectacular and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it and you get to the top </v>

371
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:20.804
<v Speaker 2>of these things though the rush and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling of accomplishment and the </v>

372
00:15:23.961 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 2>euphoria and just the glory of nature</v>

373
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.990
<v Speaker 3>from the perspective yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like,</v>

374
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.833
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could fucking wash your clothes on </v>

375
00:15:33.861 --> 00:15:35.420
<v Speaker 3>the sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's in my hands right now,</v>

376
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.500
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a stat.</v>

377
00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:41.210
<v Speaker 2>Fucking pictures insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at,</v>

378
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.220
<v Speaker 2>what is the name of this photo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

379
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a endura corner from cap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's actually,</v>

380
00:15:48.491 --> 00:15:50.460
<v Speaker 3>that's a movie poster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do Fuck.</v>

381
00:15:50.461 --> 00:15:51.294
<v Speaker 3>That man</v>

382
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.680
<v Speaker 2>is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>

383
00:15:53.940 --> 00:15:57.850
<v Speaker 2>that that is not sitting in a cubicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is</v>

384
00:15:57.970 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Speaker 3>not fluorescent light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the end of a very long path that</v>

385
00:16:01.781 --> 00:16:05.160
<v Speaker 3>you have to choose and really cultivate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

386
00:16:05.161 --> 00:16:06.160
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's for me,</v>

387
00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:06.994
<v Speaker 3>23 years of sort of going into or 22 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years or something of going down a very </v>

388
00:16:10.991 --> 00:16:13.330
<v Speaker 3>specific path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Very specific,</v>

389
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.620
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're still.</v>

390
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.200
<v Speaker 3>Do you have a different van?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you still in the same van?</v>

391
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:18.810
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a better man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last time I was here.</v>

392
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.153
<v Speaker 3>Moving on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

393
00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.000
<v Speaker 3>moved up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty exciting.</v>

394
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:25.270
<v Speaker 3>And to have a house now that's actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>a real person.</v>

395
00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.770
<v Speaker 3>I live in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I live in Las Vegas now.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

00:16:27.711 --> 00:16:28.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why Las Vegas?</v>

399
00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:33.070

<v Speaker 3>We Love Las Vegas.</v>

400
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's climbing everywhere and it's </v>

401
00:16:35.081 --> 00:16:37.630
<v Speaker 3>super accessible and it's easy and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheap.</v>

402
00:16:37.631 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 3>Cost of living easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You no traffic like everything is easy,</v>

403
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:42.130
<v Speaker 3>but I love Vegas.</v>

404
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:43.810
<v Speaker 3>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

405
00:16:43.811 --> 00:16:44.644
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whenever I go to Vegas I was looking at </v>

406
00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:46.954
<v Speaker 3>the mountains outside of it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>right there and nobody even looks at </v>

407
00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:52.600
<v Speaker 3>them from my driveway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can see 2000 foot walls.</v>

408
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can be climbing on a 2000 foot long,</v>

409
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.800
<v Speaker 3>25 minute drive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 minute drive.</v>

410
00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.270
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

411
00:16:58.271 --> 00:17:01.180
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people like to run those </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains to run those hills.</v>

412
00:17:01.181 --> 00:17:03.220
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of trail runners that live</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that area as well.</v>

413
00:17:03.221 --> 00:17:03.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>totally.</v>

414
00:17:03.731 --> 00:17:05.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The west side of town and you're like in</v>

415
00:17:05.111 --> 00:17:05.621
<v Speaker 3>the mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

416
00:17:05.621 --> 00:17:07.100
<v Speaker 3>I can go mountain biking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can go hiking,</v>

417
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.953
<v Speaker 3>I can go climbing on 20 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Vegas is kind of a misunderstood </v>

418
00:17:11.051 --> 00:17:13.480
<v Speaker 3>place really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everyone just thinks the strip,</v>

419
00:17:13.481 --> 00:17:16.260
<v Speaker 3>but it's like it's not really the strip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the mountains all around it,</v>

420
00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:18.610
<v Speaker 3>but biggest is like in a bowl of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains.</v>

421
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:20.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean all sides of it are surrounded by</v>
<v Speaker 3>mountains.</v>

422
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.730
<v Speaker 3>Will Nevada in general kind of gets </v>
<v Speaker 3>weird because.</v>

423
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know people think of the desert in </v>

424
00:17:26.531 --> 00:17:27.790
<v Speaker 3>Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but really it's mountains.</v>

425
00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:30.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's like series of mountain </v>
<v Speaker 3>ranges all the way across the state.</v>

426
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:31.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it really is.</v>

427
00:17:31.241 --> 00:17:34.750

<v Speaker 3>He lives outside of Reno and if you went</v>

428
00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.100
<v Speaker 3>near where he lives,</v>

439
00:17:54.331 --> 00:17:57.090
<v Speaker 1>basis now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little bit.</v>

440
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>stuff now and trying to get enough sleep</v>

445
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:09.780

<v Speaker 1>So in the,</v>

446
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:10.763
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years ago I could just eat a whole </v>

447
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:14.280
<v Speaker 1>tray oreos and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

448
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go climb in the gym.</v>

453
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:27.310
<v Speaker 1>you're not eating meat anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you eat a lot of vegetables and</v>

454
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:31.770
<v Speaker 1>do you get your blood work done or do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you do work with nutritionists?</v>

<v Speaker 1>So I mean I gave up eating meat for </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental reasons mostly,</v>

00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:43.303
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like basically impact on the earth and </v>

<v Speaker 1>like I'll eat meat from time to time </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly for,</v>

464
00:18:49.881 --> 00:18:51.240
<v Speaker 1>for cultural norms.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I was in Japan earlier this year and I'm</v>

466
00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:53.993
<v Speaker 1>sorry fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a bit just because I felt like </v>

467
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:57.420
<v Speaker 1>it was part of the sort of Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel experience.</v>

468
00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone hunted it,</v>

469
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.050
<v Speaker 1>would you eat it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

470
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:01.884
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

471
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.083
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is I just don't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to intentionally kill another </v>

472
00:19:05.911 --> 00:19:06.744
<v Speaker 1>creature for me to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if somebody was going to go </v>

473
00:19:09.361 --> 00:19:10.920
<v Speaker 1>hunting for me to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

474
00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:11.754
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

475
00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.190
<v Speaker 1>We're going to need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then I'm like,</v>

476
00:19:14.191 --> 00:19:15.024
<v Speaker 1>on an expedition to Antarctica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ate a bunch of random meat just </v>

477
00:19:16.891 --> 00:19:18.690
<v Speaker 1>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already there,</v>

478
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:19.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other team members have already </v>

479
00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:20.520
<v Speaker 1>brought it.</v>

480
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

481
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm hungry or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

482
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mollusks are actually a good thing for </v>

483
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:28.884
<v Speaker 1>people to look into that are Vegan or </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian and they don't want to eat </v>

484
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:35.580
<v Speaker 1>meat because they're actually more </v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive even than vegetables.</v>

485
00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:37.340
<v Speaker 1>They're not like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

486
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clams and scallops.</v>

487
00:19:39.841 --> 00:19:41.790
<v Speaker 1>They're incredibly primitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

488
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.250
<v Speaker 1>they have no feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't feel anything.</v>

489
00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:45.084
<v Speaker 1>They have no that there's an argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be made that plants </v>

490
00:19:49.261 --> 00:19:54.261
<v Speaker 1>communicate far more than mollusks </v>
<v Speaker 1>lobster,</v>

491
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 1>oysters rather mussels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barnacles.</v>

492
00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crunchy.</v>

493
00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.510
<v Speaker 1>But there's a protein to them that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to an animal protein,</v>

494
00:20:03.511 --> 00:20:06.410
<v Speaker 1>but incredibly primitive to what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insect protein.</v>

495
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's sort of a potential future </v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanity today.</v>

496
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

497
00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:12.174
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not fundamentally opposed to eating </v>

498
00:20:13.111 --> 00:20:14.160
<v Speaker 1>insects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just,</v>

499
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're rarely served.</v>

500
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:20.010
<v Speaker 1>But I would just imagine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly as you get older,</v>

501
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.430
<v Speaker 1>like nutrition would be a major factor.</v>

502
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.263
<v Speaker 1>Making sure you get the proper amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential fatty acids and making sure </v>

503
00:20:27.421 --> 00:20:32.421
<v Speaker 1>that because your brain must be like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to fuel your brain in terms of like</v>

504
00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:33.923
<v Speaker 1>giving your brain the building blocks </v>
<v Speaker 1>for neurotransmitters and all these </v>

505
00:20:37.651 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 1>different things that you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're using when you're.</v>

506
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.260
<v Speaker 1>You've got this intense concentration </v>
<v Speaker 1>for many,</v>

507
00:20:43.261 --> 00:20:46.170
<v Speaker 1>many hours at a time and you're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating when you're doing these things.</v>

508
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you do stop and you eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

509
00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:49.253
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're criminal or something </v>

510
00:20:50.111 --> 00:20:54.270
<v Speaker 1>like flowers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes little bars or nut butter.</v>

511
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Fairmount are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

512
00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.880
<v Speaker 1>those f bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever take those that has that?</v>

513
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're great.</v>

514
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I have a whole box of them will give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>some.</v>

515
00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.290

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 1>It's called a [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called F bomb,</v>

517
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.343
<v Speaker 1>like fat bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all like nut butter and oils </v>

518
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:12.460
<v Speaker 1>and it comes in a packet.</v>

519
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 1>You just ripped the top of the package </v>
<v Speaker 1>off and squeeze it in your mouth.</v>

520
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I had three x morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

521
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.160
<v Speaker 1>That's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really healthy.</v>

522
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.070
<v Speaker 1>If one sitting around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>

523
00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.040

526
00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:33.810
<v Speaker 1>office over there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know where the boxes just go.</v>

527
00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:37.000
<v Speaker 1>You can go run in and grab them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go run into that door,</v>

528
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.253
<v Speaker 1>run into the office door and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting right in the front to the right </v>

529

<v Speaker 1>I'll give you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what I'm talking about.</v>

<v Speaker 1>morning when I'm headed out the door </v>

533

<v Speaker 1>with a cup of coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of,</v>

534
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.510
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that though.</v>

535
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.593
<v Speaker 1>It was just a lot of calories at there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this sober October fitness </v>

<v Speaker 1>and they also quantify your performance,</v>

547
00:22:33.341 --> 00:22:36.040
<v Speaker 1>like how much calories you've burned.</v>

550
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.400

<v Speaker 1>academia pecan with Cecil.</v>

551
00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.383
<v Speaker 1>Fantastic stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the chocolate and sea salt one </v>

552
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:48.710
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look through in a sample of players</v>

553
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:49.270
<v Speaker 1>are good.</v>

554
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.070
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real healthy.</v>

555
00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

556
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.490
<v Speaker 1>just watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really what you need.</v>

557
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.720
<v Speaker 1>You actually list ingredients or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

558
00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.341
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

559
00:22:57.341 --> 00:22:59.150
<v Speaker 1>it seems awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you just tear,</v>

560
00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:02.600
<v Speaker 1>you smush them up and you tear the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just squirt it in your mouth.</v>

561
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do that climbing a lot.</v>

562
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I kind of prefer that to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to um,</v>

563
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gels or Goo or whatever you want to call</v>

564
00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:11.200
<v Speaker 1>it because that's just pure sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of prefer to have pure fat.</v>

565
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly for climbing,</v>

566
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:15.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not like in,</v>

567
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.963
<v Speaker 1>it's not like running or cycling or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something where your engine is burning </v>

568
00:23:17.711 --> 00:23:20.260
<v Speaker 1>nonstop where you kind of need to just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like pumps sugar into it.</v>

569
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.900
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a longer slow burn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

570
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.850
<v Speaker 1>you can eat fat for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever,</v>

571
00:23:24.851 --> 00:23:26.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mess around with nootropics at all?</v>

572
00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.010
<v Speaker 1>I've never even heard that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nootropics are,</v>

573
00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:33.210
<v Speaker 1>are the building blocks for human </v>
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitters.</v>

574
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.133
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their supplements that enhanced </v>

575
00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:39.760
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them are like standard,</v>

576
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.950
<v Speaker 1>what you'd get at like Gnc you wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of as a nootropic,</v>

577
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 1>but they're finding out they are</v>

578
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.530
<v Speaker 2>like creatine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're finding out creatine is actually</v>

579
00:23:48.531 --> 00:23:49.364
<v Speaker 2>a pretty potent nootropic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually enhances cognitive </v>

580
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:52.790
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

581
00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:53.624
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one called Alpha brain that my </v>

582

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.680
<v Speaker 2>There's another company called neuro one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes a great one.</v>

584
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill,</v>

585
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.940

<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

586
00:24:04.941 --> 00:24:05.520
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Savage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>crazy animals.</v>

590
00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 2>And during his day,</v>

00:24:16.131 --> 00:24:20.900
<v Speaker 2>obviously sustained a lot of head </v>
<v Speaker 2>injuries and wanted to find some sort of</v>

592
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:24.830
<v Speaker 2>a natural way to replenish his brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

593
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.270
<v Speaker 2>So He created this company called neuro </v>
<v Speaker 2>one and that's.</v>

594
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.570
<v Speaker 2>This is how I found out about nootropics</v>
<v Speaker 2>is through his,</v>

595
00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:33.320
<v Speaker 2>his product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic.</v>

596
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Great stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just powder.</v>

597
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:37.100
<v Speaker 2>You put it in water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shake it up.</v>

598
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:42.080
<v Speaker 2>It actually has a protein and a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different neurotransmitters in it,</v>

599
00:24:42.081 --> 00:24:44.240
<v Speaker 2>but it's really good for enhancing </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

600
00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if it actually works.</v>

601
00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:47.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

602
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alpha brain,</v>

603
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.253
<v Speaker 2>my company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had two double blind placebo </v>

604
00:24:53.481 --> 00:24:54.314
<v Speaker 2>controlled studies with the Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>Center for memory that showed </v>

605
00:24:56.121 --> 00:25:01.121
<v Speaker 2>improvements in verbal memory and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaction time in peak alpha flow state.</v>

606
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.920
<v Speaker 2>So what is peak out propose to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

607
00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.730
<v Speaker 2>You have to start to dive into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

608
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.440
<v Speaker 2>they're all the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What is that guy's name?</v>

612
00:25:21.381 --> 00:25:24.500
<v Speaker 2>That when he was a guest to the podcast,</v>

00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:37.331
<v Speaker 2>really good ones and they are fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have to give speeches or have you</v>

616
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.100
<v Speaker 2>talked to one of the things that I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

617
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.580
<v Speaker 3>commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>straight cocaine,</v>

618

<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're all fired up and you just give a </v>

619
00:25:45.021 --> 00:25:46.760
<v Speaker 3>great talk or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you just get all fired up.</v>

621
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.910
<v Speaker 3>That's a question I had for you too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like how many people that are doing what</v>

622
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:57.911
<v Speaker 3>you do are on either adderall or they </v>
<v Speaker 3>take things like Beta blockers,</v>

623
00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.520
<v Speaker 3>that sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honestly I think nobody but I mean a lot</v>

624
00:26:01.521 --> 00:26:04.370
<v Speaker 3>of climbers smoke a lot of weed or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

625
00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:05.204
<v Speaker 3>and nowadays I don't even know what you </v>
<v Speaker 3>do with it because you don't even have </v>

626
00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:10.880
<v Speaker 3>to smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just you drink it and stuff.</v>

627
00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:11.714
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's so many like cannabis things </v>

628
00:26:13.161 --> 00:26:14.270
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

629
00:26:14.271 --> 00:26:14.781
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

630
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:16.310
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never really done drugs.</v>

631
00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:18.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not totally interested center,</v>

632
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.150
<v Speaker 3>they know anything about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

633
00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:21.793
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because it's not like </v>

634
00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:23.294
<v Speaker 3>anyone's drug testing climbers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>unless they're competing in the world </v>

635
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:27.770
<v Speaker 3>cup level or it's actually gonna be in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Olympics in 2020,</v>

636
00:26:27.771 --> 00:26:29.620
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing goes,</v>

637
00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:30.500
<v Speaker 3>it's like a demonstration.</v>

638
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.980
<v Speaker 2>So did they have um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an event like in terms of like a pathway</v>

639
00:26:34.981 --> 00:26:35.814
<v Speaker 2>that you have to go through?</v>

640
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.803
<v Speaker 3>So it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's a world cup climbing breaks into </v>

641
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:39.344
<v Speaker 3>three disciplines like lead climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like a same as the indoor wall </v>

642
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 3>and then bouldering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is without a rope,</v>

643
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:45.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just climbed 12 feet or whatever.</v>

644
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:48.660
<v Speaker 3>And then speed climbing where it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a preset course.</v>

645
00:26:48.661 --> 00:26:51.040
<v Speaker 3>Everyone does the exact same course </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you just go as fast as you can and</v>

646
00:26:51.041 --> 00:26:51.874
<v Speaker 3>just against the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so normally those are three </v>

647
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:54.924
<v Speaker 3>disciplines for the World Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the Olympic format combines all </v>

648
00:26:57.031 --> 00:26:57.864
<v Speaker 3>three into one competition because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're limited by how many metals and </v>

649
00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:02.640
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's like a demonstration sport.</v>

650
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.980
<v Speaker 3>They're just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

651
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.833
<v Speaker 3>it's smaller scale than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>than some of the other sports in the </v>

652
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:08.100
<v Speaker 3>Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>

653
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

654
00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:09.683
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so basically common competitors just </v>

655
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:13.530
<v Speaker 3>have to do all three disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And See who wins.</v>

656
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.520
<v Speaker 3>I was watching something on youtube </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they had this climbing competition</v>

657
00:27:17.521 --> 00:27:17.700
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

658
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 3>They like ready,</v>
<v Speaker 3>set,</v>

659
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.490
<v Speaker 3>go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then they like shot up.</v>

660
00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.360
<v Speaker 3>That's the speed coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this lady who's wearing a burka,</v>

661
00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.150
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she like famous or something.</v>

662
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:27.751
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

663
00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:28.584
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are a bunch of really strong </v>

664
00:27:30.361 --> 00:27:33.300
<v Speaker 3>Iranian speed climbers and so I wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>be surprised if,</v>

665
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:33.950
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

666
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:34.760
<v Speaker 3>it's part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

667
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.180
<v Speaker 3>she ran up at like a spider was crazy to</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch yet for whatever reason,</v>

668
00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:40.950
<v Speaker 3>speak something is really big in eastern</v>
<v Speaker 3>Europe.</v>

669
00:27:40.951 --> 00:27:44.770
<v Speaker 3>And then there are a couple of really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good Iranian speed commerce and um,</v>

670
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:45.653
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just,</v>

671
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.513

<v Speaker 3>it's own little niche sport coming out </v>

672
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:49.524
<v Speaker 3>of certain parts of the world that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's some strong genes over </v>

<v Speaker 3>is that impressive?</v>

698
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>See that play that from the beginning,</v>

699
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.173
<v Speaker 3>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

700
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:04.230
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not as fast.</v>

701
00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:05.064
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you watch some of the more lead </v>

702
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:07.224
<v Speaker 3>times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

703
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.600
<v Speaker 3>it's faster for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

704
00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.450
<v Speaker 3>women or men?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both,</v>

705
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.350
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's true in that.</v>

706
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:16.970
<v Speaker 3>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

707
00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.210
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know man.</v>

708
00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.103
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

709
00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.600
<v Speaker 3>you're the guy who would know to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's damn impressive.</v>

710
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.330
<v Speaker 3>Just look up a world record.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

711
00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:25.350
<v Speaker 3>I think the male record is like five </v>
<v Speaker 3>point seven seconds,</v>

712
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.270
<v Speaker 3>six seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like something really,</v>

713
00:29:27.271 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 3>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

714
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:30.650
<v Speaker 3>Do they know this path in advance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

715
00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 3>So that's exactly the same route for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody.</v>

716
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Always same distance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>same holds.</v>

717
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.423
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you basically memorize the </v>

718
00:29:37.201 --> 00:29:39.390
<v Speaker 3>sequence and then you just perform it as</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast as you can.</v>

719
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 3>So here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the world record as this.</v>

720
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:46.053
<v Speaker 3>So you stand on that thing and the timer</v>
<v Speaker 3>starts when your one foot comes off the </v>

721
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 3>timer on the ground and then it ends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you slap the thing on the top.</v>

722
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

723
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 3>Look at that five point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever seconds.</v>

724
00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.770
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't look real.</v>

725
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look like he's just running </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the sidewalk.</v>

726
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:08.320
<v Speaker 3>Just tilted the camera and they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're faking it.</v>

727
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.580
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For the camera.</v>

728
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:09.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

729
00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 3>it's totally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

730
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:14.770
<v Speaker 3>do these guys free solo or they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they specifically concentrate on.</v>

731
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:16.830
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if you were free,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so like,</v>

732
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.310
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would die for sure.</v>

733
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:20.683
<v Speaker 3>Know that Beta blockers would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>something that someone who free Solos </v>

734
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.630
<v Speaker 3>would want to look into.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know yet.</v>

735
00:30:26.631 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that it was Beta blockers </v>
<v Speaker 3>or something that blocks your,</v>

736
00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.820
<v Speaker 3>your brain's production of adrenaline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

737
00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:33.880
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you'd want that though,</v>

738
00:30:33.881 --> 00:30:34.714
<v Speaker 3>because the thing is if you have an </v>
<v Speaker 3>adrenaline spike it's because something </v>

739
00:30:36.611 --> 00:30:38.290
<v Speaker 3>weird went on and you probably want to.</v>

740
00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:39.323
<v Speaker 3>Like I've had A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a couple times where I broke a </v>

741
00:30:41.081 --> 00:30:41.914
<v Speaker 3>hold off or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like all of a sudden your whole drips </v>

742
00:30:43.031 --> 00:30:43.864
<v Speaker 3>off and then you have that like </v>
<v Speaker 3>superhuman surgery and you grabbed back </v>

743
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:47.711
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

744
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:49.270
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be mellow at that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

745
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:49.871
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

746
00:30:49.871 --> 00:30:50.704
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so relaxed as I fall all the way to </v>

747
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:54.100
<v Speaker 3>the valley floor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

748
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:57.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like you want to fricking hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things in the film was one of</v>

749
00:30:57.251 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 3>the guys who fell and I guess eventually</v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

750
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 3>He was doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fell and base jumped.</v>

751
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:03.843
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With a parachute.</v>

752
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:05.013
<v Speaker 3>He called it freebasing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sort of pioneered the sport as a </v>

753
00:31:08.441 --> 00:31:11.050
<v Speaker 3>word,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're usually a good thing to have</v>

754
00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:12.460
<v Speaker 3>on your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

755
00:31:12.461 --> 00:31:14.110
<v Speaker 3>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

756
00:31:14.111 --> 00:31:16.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean the idea makes sense that if </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to fall off a cliff,</v>

757
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.363
<v Speaker 3>have a parachute.</v>

758
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.580
<v Speaker 3>The thing is that you need to be on a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very specific kind of cliff,</v>

759
00:31:20.581 --> 00:31:22.420
<v Speaker 3>like what he was on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it was overhanging so that when he</v>

760
00:31:22.421 --> 00:31:25.150
<v Speaker 3>fell he cleared the wall and he floated </v>
<v Speaker 3>out into space.</v>

761
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.343
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is when you send money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the walls are slightly less than </v>

762
00:31:27.731 --> 00:31:28.564
<v Speaker 3>vertical in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it means that you just tumbled </v>

763
00:31:30.531 --> 00:31:31.950
<v Speaker 3>down the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

764
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.780
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing is that even if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a parachute,</v>

765
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.620
<v Speaker 3>parachutes function as a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you have a direction to them,</v>

766
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.800
<v Speaker 3>like Eric comes into them and you fly in</v>
<v Speaker 3>a direction which means that you have to</v>

767
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:42.634
<v Speaker 3>be facing away from the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you opened your parachute or else </v>

768
00:31:44.441 --> 00:31:46.090
<v Speaker 3>you just fly right into the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 3>crash.</v>

769
00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:47.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it basically means that if you fall </v>

770
00:31:48.611 --> 00:31:49.444
<v Speaker 3>off unexpectedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you then have to track away from the </v>

771
00:31:51.221 --> 00:31:51.580
<v Speaker 3>wall.</v>

772
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 3>Write yourself in mid air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

773
00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:55.450
<v Speaker 3>correct for everything and then make </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure you're facing the right way.</v>

774
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.813
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>basically there's a lot of things that </v>

775
00:31:57.311 --> 00:31:58.990
<v Speaker 3>have to go right for the parachute to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help you.</v>

776
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:02.590
<v Speaker 3>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not good.</v>

777
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's one of,</v>

778
00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.080
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people ask that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

779
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:06.130
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't you wear a parachute?</v>

780
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:06.964
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well it's basically this 10 pound </v>

781
00:32:07.571 --> 00:32:10.000
<v Speaker 3>training weight that doesn't really help</v>
<v Speaker 3>you much with that guy.</v>

782
00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:11.710
<v Speaker 3>Just jumped on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

783
00:32:11.711 --> 00:32:12.461
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

784
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:14.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

785
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is on the Uyghur though,</v>

786
00:32:16.451 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 3>it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

787
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.420
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you can.</v>

788
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.250
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's like jumping away.</v>

789
00:32:21.251 --> 00:32:24.970
<v Speaker 3>He's getting a nice controlled opening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like flying away from the cliff.</v>

790
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:26.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like everything is going right for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

791
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:27.723
<v Speaker 3>But imagine if one of his foot holes </v>
<v Speaker 3>just broke and he started pinwheel and </v>

792
00:32:29.521 --> 00:32:31.870
<v Speaker 3>down the wall it's like you'd never get </v>
<v Speaker 3>the separation from the wall.</v>

793
00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.893
<v Speaker 3>Disaster like was just watch extreme </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports videos and I'll just commentate </v>

794
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.203
<v Speaker 3>on them because were like all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well this guy is surely going to have a </v>

795
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:43.150
<v Speaker 3>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

796
00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:44.013
<v Speaker 3>one of the things from the video when </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were talking about all the people </v>

797
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:49.010
<v Speaker 3>that have died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that every,</v>

798
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.113
<v Speaker 3>essentially everyone from the past that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a free solar is dead and you're </v>

799
00:32:53.451 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 3>saying there's other things that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>were doing,</v>

800
00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:58.310
<v Speaker 3>like base jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like base jumping and,</v>

801
00:32:58.311 --> 00:32:59.061
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and even,</v>

802
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:01.490
<v Speaker 3>there are a couple of older soloists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean in the film,</v>

803
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Croft,</v>

804
00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 3>who's like a legendary soloist and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a childhood hero of mine and he's,</v>

805
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to say pushing 66.</v>

806
00:33:07.941 --> 00:33:09.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure how old Peter is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's,</v>

807
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:10.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an older,</v>

808
00:33:10.191 --> 00:33:12.120
<v Speaker 3>he's a distinguished gentleman and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

809
00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.330
<v Speaker 3>he's living in the eastern Sierra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's climbing all the time.</v>

810
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:15.163
<v Speaker 3>He's like loving life with his wife and </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually he's in Greece on a sport </v>

811
00:33:17.271 --> 00:33:20.420
<v Speaker 3>climbing vacation right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just climbing for two months,</v>

812
00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 3>just fun climbing with a rope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a great time.</v>

813
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.073
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

814
00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.300
<v Speaker 3>I look at somebody like Peter and he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was free soloing at,</v>

815
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.180
<v Speaker 3>at the very cutting edge for 20 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>

816
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.660
<v Speaker 3>And it's still just a happy climate now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does he free solo anymore?</v>

817
00:33:33.661 --> 00:33:35.240
<v Speaker 3>It just climbs well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's funny.</v>

818
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.550
<v Speaker 3>I had dinner with him a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and I was like,</v>

819
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:38.384
<v Speaker 3>oh Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at what point did you quit soloing at </v>

820
00:33:39.571 --> 00:33:40.760
<v Speaker 3>sort of an elite level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

821
00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:42.440
<v Speaker 3>like when did you sort of back off the </v>
<v Speaker 3>grids?</v>

822
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:43.274
<v Speaker 3>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well actually I did want to technically </v>

823
00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:47.180
<v Speaker 3>by the numbers I did one of my hardest </v>
<v Speaker 3>free solos couple of years ago.</v>

824
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:48.283
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was like a sport route at his </v>

825
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:49.890
<v Speaker 3>local Craig.</v>

826
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.310
<v Speaker 3>So like a route that he routinely climb </v>
<v Speaker 3>for fitness.</v>

827
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.230
<v Speaker 3>They just happened to be a pretty hard </v>
<v Speaker 3>number,</v>

828
00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.080
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like climate grades are all sorted,</v>

829
00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.190
<v Speaker 3>categorized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you use like.</v>

830
00:33:58.191 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>technically one of my hardest solos.</v>

831
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:00.344
<v Speaker 3>It was just recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like a hard number but not </v>

832
00:34:02.571 --> 00:34:03.404
<v Speaker 3>nearly as much of an undertaking as some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the big solos that he'd done in the </v>

833
00:34:05.781 --> 00:34:06.614
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like some of the walls that he had at </v>

834
00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.590
<v Speaker 3>any 70 back in the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

835
00:34:09.591 --> 00:34:10.970
<v Speaker 3>And so he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

836
00:34:10.971 --> 00:34:12.980
<v Speaker 3>it's all just kind of how you define </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulty,</v>

837
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:14.620
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now when,</v>

838
00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.290
<v Speaker 3>when you say that there's a number </v>
<v Speaker 3>system that sort of rates what,</v>

839
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:21.950
<v Speaker 3>like how difficult a free Solo Path is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

840
00:34:21.951 --> 00:34:22.784
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rates climbing in general with a </v>

841
00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:26.330
<v Speaker 3>rope or without a rope is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just rates how hard our climate is.</v>

842
00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.830
<v Speaker 3>What is El Cap was?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the route that I climbed is 5:12</v>

843
00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.690
<v Speaker 3>d for whatever that means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe it's 13,</v>

844
00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:36.050
<v Speaker 3>eight depending on how you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on what you want to call it.</v>

845
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that mean?</v>

846
00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>

847
00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:42.530
<v Speaker 3>So the climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing grades are defined,</v>

848
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So in America it's by the,</v>

849
00:34:45.691 --> 00:34:46.524
<v Speaker 3>you many decimal system and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>classification of terrain from one to </v>

850
00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:53.550
<v Speaker 3>one to six decibels decimal decimal </v>
<v Speaker 3>system,</v>

851
00:34:53.551 --> 00:34:54.500
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

852
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:55.483
<v Speaker 3>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's other parts of the world have </v>

853
00:34:57.351 --> 00:34:58.184
<v Speaker 3>different systems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like I'm in Australia is just an </v>

854
00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.590
<v Speaker 3>open ended numbers from one to 38 or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

855
00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.730
<v Speaker 3>Whereas they get progressively harder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

856
00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:06.950
<v Speaker 3>there it is right here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>

857
00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Climbing grade comparison.</v>

858
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting to one.</v>

859
00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:12.473
<v Speaker 3>They all do it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was because climbing culture grew up </v>

860
00:35:15.201 --> 00:35:16.430
<v Speaker 3>in all different parts of the world.</v>

861
00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.353
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And climbing culture I guess is a big </v>

862
00:35:19.401 --> 00:35:21.770
<v Speaker 3>part of Yosemite yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

863
00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:22.663
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean climbing as a sport in the US is </v>

864
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:27.074
<v Speaker 3>sort of birthed from you somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the history of albinism or </v>

865
00:35:30.591 --> 00:35:32.450
<v Speaker 3>climate rock climbing anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certainly comes from you.</v>

866
00:35:32.451 --> 00:35:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Somebody in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it just because the paths are so cool</v>

867
00:35:35.781 --> 00:35:38.880
<v Speaker 3>that it just drew people to it or.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

868
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.631
<v Speaker 3>partially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

869
00:35:39.631 --> 00:35:40.464
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the summits are so striking and I think </v>

870
00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:44.960
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it also just had to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

871
00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:46.463
<v Speaker 3>just culture because a big part of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was people from La and the bay area who </v>

872
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:52.560
<v Speaker 3>probably had some sense of classical </v>
<v Speaker 3>albinism from the Alps,</v>

873
00:35:52.561 --> 00:35:53.394
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who have traveled to some extent </v>

874
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:58.170
<v Speaker 3>and then wanted to climb other mountains</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they happen to live near one of</v>

875
00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:00.210
<v Speaker 3>the most iconic areas in the world.</v>

876
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:01.050
<v Speaker 3>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

877
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:02.393
<v Speaker 3>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it winds up being called the </v>

878
00:36:02.871 --> 00:36:04.920
<v Speaker 3>ascending decimal system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

879
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.600
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so basically it's the,</v>

880
00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's categories of terrain,</v>

881
00:36:08.911 --> 00:36:12.240
<v Speaker 3>so one being walking on a normal trail </v>
<v Speaker 3>to being like scrambling a little bit,</v>

882
00:36:12.241 --> 00:36:14.550
<v Speaker 3>three being like scrambling with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>hands and feet up,</v>

883
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:15.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rocks and then fourth class being like </v>

884
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 3>sorta like climbing but easier and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>fifth class being actual rock climbing.</v>

885
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:22.703
<v Speaker 3>And so then it was five point one </v>
<v Speaker 3>through nine depending on how hard </v>

886
00:36:26.701 --> 00:36:27.500
<v Speaker 3>things are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

887
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.860
<v Speaker 3>so five point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one being pretty easy,</v>

888
00:36:28.861 --> 00:36:29.694
<v Speaker 3>five point nine being pretty hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're rock climbing now and </v>

889
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.513
<v Speaker 3>technical and then at a certain point </v>
<v Speaker 3>that system wasn't adequate so they had </v>

890
00:36:36.631 --> 00:36:37.340
<v Speaker 3>to start adding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

891
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.173
<v Speaker 3>fivepoint 10 and then they subdivided </v>
<v Speaker 3>into Abcd and then five point 11 abcd </v>

892
00:36:42.271 --> 00:36:43.104
<v Speaker 3>and the five point 12.</v>

893
00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.093
<v Speaker 3>And so now it's an open ended system </v>
<v Speaker 3>that right now goes up to five slash 16 </v>

894
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:47.800
<v Speaker 3>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa.</v>

895
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.410
<v Speaker 3>El Cap is really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

896
00:36:50.411 --> 00:36:55.411
<v Speaker 3>But so el Cap is 12 d or five point 12 d</v>
<v Speaker 3>or maybe five point 13 eight,</v>

897
00:36:56.521 --> 00:36:58.140
<v Speaker 3>which is the next grade up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

898
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.120
<v Speaker 3>it's all sorted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

899
00:37:00.121 --> 00:37:02.730
<v Speaker 3>so basically that means that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's elite.</v>

900
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Like that's very difficult and something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like a,</v>

901
00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.143
<v Speaker 3>obviously an average person can do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's definitely not close to the </v>

902
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:10.680
<v Speaker 3>physical limit of what's been done in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

903
00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:11.883
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's with a rope on and that's </v>

904
00:37:13.021 --> 00:37:13.854
<v Speaker 3>after you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>years of practice and what's the </v>

905
00:37:15.151 --> 00:37:17.490
<v Speaker 3>physical limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what is the peak of where right now</v>

906
00:37:17.491 --> 00:37:21.630
<v Speaker 3>the hardest grade in the world is 15 d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is extremely hard.</v>

907
00:37:21.631 --> 00:37:22.411
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally crazy,</v>

908
00:37:22.411 --> 00:37:23.244
<v Speaker 3>but so one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy has done one route that he </v>

909
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:28.620
<v Speaker 3>called 15 d and so it hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>repeated so it's not like an established</v>

910
00:37:28.621 --> 00:37:29.454
<v Speaker 3>consensus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are several 15 seas in the </v>

911
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:33.810
<v Speaker 3>world and there are many 15 bees in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

912
00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.860
<v Speaker 3>Whereas this 15 d,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in a cave in Norway.</v>

913
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:40.743
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

914
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the kind of the interesting thing</v>

915
00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:43.524
<v Speaker 3>about climbing grades and climbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulties that they're all spread </v>

916
00:37:45.991 --> 00:37:46.824
<v Speaker 3>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the very specific clips because it </v>

917
00:37:47.941 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 3>requires just the right combination of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of angle and holds,</v>

918
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.343
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there have to be enough things to hold </v>

919
00:37:52.951 --> 00:37:54.860
<v Speaker 3>onto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not too many else.</v>

920
00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.703
<v Speaker 3>It's easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I for an elite climber and </v>

921
00:37:58.341 --> 00:37:59.760
<v Speaker 3>they're basically searching the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time,</v>

922
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:01.980
<v Speaker 3>trying to find that right mixture of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of rock.</v>

923
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:04.320
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a strange existence.</v>

924
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.030
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really nice.</v>

925
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Yachts forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unusual now when you hear about it,</v>

926
00:38:08.911 --> 00:38:10.350
<v Speaker 3>but it's also kind of elemental in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

927
00:38:10.351 --> 00:38:11.184
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because rocks are just out there and </v>

928
00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:13.644
<v Speaker 3>you're basically just going and </v>
<v Speaker 3>exploring nature until you find the </v>

929
00:38:15.631 --> 00:38:17.090
<v Speaker 3>right kind of challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

930
00:38:17.091 --> 00:38:17.491
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's.</v>

931
00:38:17.491 --> 00:38:18.324
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some sort of a primal </v>

932
00:38:18.961 --> 00:38:21.090
<v Speaker 3>satisfaction that comes from climbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

933
00:38:21.091 --> 00:38:21.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

934
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:22.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

935
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.490
<v Speaker 3>There's a certain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

936
00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:25.260
<v Speaker 3>there's an elemental quality for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where you're like,</v>

937
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.300
<v Speaker 3>this is something that just exists in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

938
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:29.080
<v Speaker 3>And you just say you have this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

939
00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.053
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

940
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.030
<v Speaker 3>this is Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrea,</v>

941
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 3>this check kid climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15 odd commander coming out about it,</v>

942
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:34.560
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

943
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.280
<v Speaker 3>it's already out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

944
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.630
<v Speaker 3>it's a short online actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silence.</v>

945
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:39.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The route he put up,</v>

946
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:40.420
<v Speaker 3>he called silence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

947
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 3>if this is the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just scrub all the way to the.</v>

948
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.593
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the.</v>

949
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:45.183
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can see he's climbing feet first </v>

950
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:48.340
<v Speaker 3>through some of it and it's totally </v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme.</v>

951
00:38:48.341 --> 00:38:50.370
<v Speaker 3>It's so this Guy Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrea is,</v>

952
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 3>is for sure the strongest climber in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world right now.</v>

953
00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 3>Like physical?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

954
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:55.090
<v Speaker 3>Physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's,</v>

955
00:38:55.091 --> 00:38:57.940
<v Speaker 3>he put up the world's first 15 c and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first 15 d,</v>

956
00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:58.803
<v Speaker 3>so he's basically push the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 3>difficulty for the last several grades </v>

957
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.840
<v Speaker 3>and he's just freakishly strong.</v>

958
00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.820
<v Speaker 3>Is that something that you would have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be to do what he's doing?</v>

959
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Like A,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a regular climber?</v>

960
00:39:11.531 --> 00:39:14.290
<v Speaker 3>Couldn't do what he's doing is almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>like acrobatic involved.</v>

961
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:16.030
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we look at what he's doing right there.</v>

962
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:17.303
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

963
00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.630
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is the world's first 15.</v>

964
00:39:19.631 --> 00:39:21.430
<v Speaker 3>See?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So slightly easier.</v>

965
00:39:21.431 --> 00:39:23.500
<v Speaker 3>He did this several years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like,</v>

966
00:39:23.501 --> 00:39:25.390
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then here I'm like,</v>

967
00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.980
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's where he has a rope,</v>

968
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:27.814
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you trust that over and over and </v>

969
00:39:28.331 --> 00:39:30.400
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

970
00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:31.690
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an amazing climber.</v>

971
00:39:31.691 --> 00:39:33.460
<v Speaker 3>He's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like a polymath.</v>

972
00:39:33.461 --> 00:39:36.220
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's graded every discipline.</v>

973
00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.240
<v Speaker 3>What else does he do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

974
00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.020
<v Speaker 3>so he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard at the dawn wall on Ocap?</v>

975
00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so Tommy Caldwell.</v>

976
00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.880
<v Speaker 3>You know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Another professional climber.</v>

977
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

978
00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.610
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>

979
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:49.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

980
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.820
<v Speaker 3>he's basically one of America's best </v>
<v Speaker 3>climbers.</v>

981
00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:54.100
<v Speaker 3>He did this route called the dawn wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

982
00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:54.993
<v Speaker 3>which is also a film in theaters or </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't theaters last month is sort of </v>

983
00:39:58.451 --> 00:40:01.060
<v Speaker 3>random that to big con and films came </v>
<v Speaker 3>out exactly the same time,</v>

984
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:02.410
<v Speaker 3>but it was just one of those freak </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

985
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:03.573
<v Speaker 3>But so the dawn wall was considered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>hardest climb in the world to some </v>

986
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:08.140
<v Speaker 3>extent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's this thing,</v>

987
00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:10.870
<v Speaker 3>it was a seven year project for him up </v>
<v Speaker 3>up the right side of El Cap.</v>

988
00:40:10.871 --> 00:40:12.420
<v Speaker 3>The thing I climbed on the left side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh Kathy,</v>

989
00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.410
<v Speaker 3>he comes something on the right side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is much harder,</v>

990
00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:16.930
<v Speaker 3>but he was using a rope and put seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>years of work into it.</v>

991
00:40:17.530 --> 00:40:18.550
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

992
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:19.540
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

993
00:40:19.541 --> 00:40:21.820
<v Speaker 3>And then this Guy Adam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>100 who were watching a video of,</v>

994
00:40:21.821 --> 00:40:22.180
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

995
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.013
<v Speaker 3>he did the second ascent and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he put like a month of work into it and </v>

996
00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.610
<v Speaker 3>repeated it and you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>

997
00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:28.750
<v Speaker 3>he's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really strong.</v>

998
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:29.853
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you see a guy do something like </v>

999
00:40:32.621 --> 00:40:33.454
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does that make you think about doing it </v>

1000
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:36.543
<v Speaker 3>or do you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's only something that someone </v>

1001
00:40:38.081 --> 00:40:39.670
<v Speaker 3>can do with raw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With ropes.</v>

1002
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:40.420
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1003
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:41.253
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are whole categories of </v>

1004
00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:43.684
<v Speaker 3>climate that can only be done with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rope because the moves are way too </v>

1005
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:47.650
<v Speaker 3>insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fall off way too often.</v>

1006
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.900
<v Speaker 3>I mean anything that kind of fall off </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing that.</v>

1007
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hundreds or maybe even thousands of</v>

1008
00:40:51.761 --> 00:40:54.190
<v Speaker 3>times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So for him to,</v>

1009
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:59.520
<v Speaker 3>for him to do something at the heart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean to,</v>

1010
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.430
<v Speaker 3>to climb at the very highest levels of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of human potential.</v>

1011
00:41:02.431 --> 00:41:03.264
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so think about a gymnast or something </v>

1012
00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.790
<v Speaker 3>that him right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So He's free soloing?</v>

1013
00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:07.121
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1014
00:41:07.121 --> 00:41:08.080
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has a harness on.</v>

1015
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.120
<v Speaker 3>He's got a rope right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1016
00:41:10.121 --> 00:41:13.210
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean look at what he's holding his one</v>

1017
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:14.150
<v Speaker 3>finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1018
00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.810
<v Speaker 3>I think is the other one might be onto </v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1019
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.770
<v Speaker 3>but it's basically like a tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tiny,</v>

1020
00:41:17.771 --> 00:41:18.604
<v Speaker 3>tiny edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the crux of one of the pitchers </v>

1021
00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:20.830
<v Speaker 3>on the dawn wall.</v>

1022
00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:21.663
<v Speaker 3>That is so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That guy could probably crush your head </v>

1023
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.660
<v Speaker 3>by just grabbing it when certainly the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has a certain ferocity,</v>

1024
00:41:28.661 --> 00:41:31.660
<v Speaker 3>he has an intensity where you can try </v>
<v Speaker 3>with like 115 percent just like,</v>

1025
00:41:31.661 --> 00:41:32.494
<v Speaker 3>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm pretty sure if he grabbed your </v>

1026
00:41:33.381 --> 00:41:34.214
<v Speaker 3>head and I tried as hard as it would </v>
<v Speaker 3>just pop like a little melon grip </v>

1027
00:41:38.721 --> 00:41:41.210
<v Speaker 3>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's holding on to such a tiny,</v>

1028
00:41:41.211 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 3>tiny little things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1029
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:43.850
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a very,</v>

1030
00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:48.020
<v Speaker 3>very strong wow man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So a guy like that,</v>

1031
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:48.913
<v Speaker 3>when you see him do these paths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these paths or paths that you can only </v>

1032
00:41:52.341 --> 00:41:54.170
<v Speaker 3>do with a rope?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does he free solo as well?</v>

1034
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:01.010
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he ever has,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not really his thing.</v>

1035
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.963
<v Speaker 3>And the thing that in some ways it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>really hard to do both at a high level </v>

1036
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:05.930
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1037
00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:09.170
<v Speaker 3>I think or at least to some extent it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard to do both at a high level because.</v>

1038
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:12.380
<v Speaker 3>So for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for him to climb something that hard,</v>

1039
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:15.410
<v Speaker 3>he needs that intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He needs a 115 percent effort.</v>

1040
00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.573
<v Speaker 3>But if you're trying to free Solo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well you definitely should never be </v>

1041
00:42:18.681 --> 00:42:22.970
<v Speaker 3>giving anything even remotely close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>115 percent effort or will die for sure.</v>

1042
00:42:23.110 --> 00:42:23.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you're so close to that razor </v>

1043
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:26.600
<v Speaker 3>edge of failure when you're trying that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>

1044
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.063
<v Speaker 3>But with freestyle and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>always keep it sort of within your </v>

1045
00:42:29.541 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 3>comfort zone because you don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>die doing it.</v>

1046
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:35.540
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that I've always sort of kept my</v>

1047
00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:36.613
<v Speaker 3>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're on your personal barometer </v>

1048
00:42:38.061 --> 00:42:40.520
<v Speaker 3>of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sort of live between four and seven,</v>

1049
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:41.354
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or like three and a half and seven </v>

1050
00:42:43.371 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where it's like you're never too relaxed</v>

1051
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:46.513
<v Speaker 3>but you're also never going to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolute death or sort of like in the </v>

1052
00:42:48.471 --> 00:42:50.060
<v Speaker 3>four to six is a sweet spot where you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1053
00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:51.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm having a good time.</v>

1054
00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:53.880
<v Speaker 3>But I'm not like trying too hard and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>not relaxed.</v>

1055
00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:55.093
<v Speaker 3>But.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So somebody gotta monitor or Tommy </v>

1056
00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.080
<v Speaker 3>Caldwell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I've,</v>

1057
00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:58.560
<v Speaker 3>I've climbed with Tommy a lot over the </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1058
00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:02.620
<v Speaker 3>He's a great climber and I've really </v>
<v Speaker 3>seen this because he had like,</v>

1059
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:05.690
<v Speaker 3>I've seen him just randomly fall off </v>
<v Speaker 3>many times because he was,</v>

1060
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:06.840
<v Speaker 3>he just slept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

1061
00:43:06.841 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm so relaxed.</v>

1062
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:08.690
<v Speaker 3>It's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then it's like,</v>

1063
00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.553
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I slipped and that's kind of like an </v>

1064
00:43:10.491 --> 00:43:13.090
<v Speaker 3>effort of one where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body is so relaxed that if,</v>

1065
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.450
<v Speaker 3>if anything happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you fall and with,</v>

1066
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 3>with a rope on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

1067
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:19.750
<v Speaker 3>In some ways that's the more efficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to climb because you know,</v>

1068
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:20.623
<v Speaker 3>you're so relaxed most of the time that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saving a lot of energy over all </v>

1069
00:43:22.671 --> 00:43:24.110
<v Speaker 3>that every once in a while when you </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall.</v>

1070
00:43:24.111 --> 00:43:24.741
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who cares?</v>

1071
00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:25.460
<v Speaker 3>The rope catches you.</v>

1072
00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.293
<v Speaker 3>It's no problem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you have to trust those little </v>

1073
00:43:27.501 --> 00:43:30.080
<v Speaker 3>things that you stick in the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's all.</v>

1074
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.400
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1075
00:43:31.401 --> 00:43:31.791
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1076
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:32.570
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of like,</v>

1077
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:34.360
<v Speaker 3>what is he doing there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's uh,</v>

1078
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.280
<v Speaker 3>he's counter pressure me his leg into </v>
<v Speaker 3>this cracked arrest.</v>

1079
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:39.620
<v Speaker 3>He's basically like pushing his knee </v>
<v Speaker 3>into the rock to,</v>

1080
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:40.454
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to relax his arms from his </v>

1081
00:43:42.261 --> 00:43:44.290
<v Speaker 3>whole body leaning backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1082
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:45.124
<v Speaker 3>So he's hanging upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically every muscle in his body is </v>

1083
00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:47.474
<v Speaker 3>relaxed except for his calf and his calf</v>
<v Speaker 3>is forcing his knee into the rock which </v>

1084
00:43:50.001 --> 00:43:50.834
<v Speaker 3>holds them in place.</v>

1085
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:53.743
<v Speaker 3>That is so insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That photo is so insane that that's a </v>

1086
00:43:57.081 --> 00:43:58.850
<v Speaker 3>really efficient way to rest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to rest,</v>

1087
00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:00.750
<v Speaker 3>to rest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your arms will be good.</v>

1088
00:44:00.751 --> 00:44:02.960
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1089
00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.593
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For him it's like for him to be able to </v>

1090
00:44:06.471 --> 00:44:07.304
<v Speaker 3>rest like that for one minute is an </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing way to rest your arms for a </v>

1091
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:12.200
<v Speaker 3>minute and then it sort of saps your </v>
<v Speaker 3>core and it makes us cap really tired.</v>

1092
00:44:12.201 --> 00:44:14.480
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now there's a guy like,</v>

1093
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.270
<v Speaker 3>does he lift weights or anything to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare for these things?</v>

1094
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.010
<v Speaker 3>There's just no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing it.</v>

1095
00:44:19.011 --> 00:44:20.390
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's on his own program,</v>

1096
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:21.503
<v Speaker 3>but it's really climate specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's mostly doing things with his </v>

1097
00:44:23.751 --> 00:44:26.000
<v Speaker 3>fingers and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's pretty jacked.</v>

1098
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.530
<v Speaker 3>Is that even him?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1099
00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:28.380
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1100
00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.331
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the same.</v>

1101
00:44:29.331 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 3>It's the same route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's interesting.</v>

1102
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen that photo,</v>

1103
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:33.413
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you just get jacked from doing </v>

1104
00:44:35.161 --> 00:44:37.590
<v Speaker 1>that too though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just constantly pulling yourself up.</v>

1105
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

1106
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.863
<v Speaker 1>There's a climbing wall just like local </v>
<v Speaker 1>a kid's place and I told my daughter </v>

1107
00:44:44.191 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 1>give her 100 bucks if she could make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way to the other side.</v>

1108
00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.653
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty difficult and so she's </v>
<v Speaker 1>become obsessed with trying to get over </v>

1109
00:44:52.081 --> 00:44:54.450
<v Speaker 1>that to get 100 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely Jack.</v>

1110
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:55.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's Jack.</v>

1111
00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Your daughter's going to wind up super </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripped.</v>

1112
00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do my like really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to do it and I couldn't do it.</v>

1113
00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:01.261
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1114
00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 1>this is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to do.</v>

1115
00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet if you.</v>

1116
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:05.904
<v Speaker 1>If you try it a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just because you have such a </v>

1117
00:45:06.991 --> 00:45:08.820
<v Speaker 1>background in movement and fitness and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1118
00:45:08.821 --> 00:45:10.170
<v Speaker 1>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet it wouldn't be that hard for,</v>

1119
00:45:10.171 --> 00:45:11.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instruction.</v>

1120
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty heavy though.</v>

1121
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 1>For someone who's short the that'd be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue is hanging on $200.</v>

1122
00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.140
<v Speaker 1>So in theory climbing should be more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your legs anyway.</v>

1123
00:45:21.141 --> 00:45:24.030
<v Speaker 1>She'd be driving with your legs because </v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what,</v>

1124
00:45:24.031 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 1>your legs are always bigger and stronger</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscles in your arms.</v>

1125
00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.493
<v Speaker 1>So that's always what drives you upward </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then your arms should only be </v>

1126
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:31.014
<v Speaker 1>holding your weight in and keeping your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping you balanced over your feet </v>

1127
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:34.800
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

1128
00:45:34.801 --> 00:45:35.634
<v Speaker 1>That's something that they figured out </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly recently with grappling over the </v>

1129
00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:39.653
<v Speaker 1>last 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years with Jujitsu and things along </v>

1130
00:45:41.791 --> 00:45:44.000
<v Speaker 1>those lines that your legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1131
00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:47.230
<v Speaker 1>it's really important to use mostly your</v>
<v Speaker 1>legs when you're grappling.</v>

1132
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see that.</v>

1133
00:45:48.371 --> 00:45:49.204
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what's driving you forward</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pushing the whole trolling your </v>

1134
00:45:51.931 --> 00:45:55.320
<v Speaker 1>opponent and manipulating your opponent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing stuff with your legs.</v>

1135
00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:57.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you do anything to cross train?</v>

1136
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Like not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no other mountain sports,</v>

1137
00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:04.380
<v Speaker 1>a little mountain biking or skiing or </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

1138
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.420
<v Speaker 1>We do it for fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for fun.</v>

1139
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:07.553
<v Speaker 1>And then um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only real cross training and it was </v>

1140
00:46:09.541 --> 00:46:11.690
<v Speaker 1>just sort of like a pushup and core type</v>
<v Speaker 1>routine,</v>

1141
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:12.873
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like opposition training just to </v>

1142
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.950
<v Speaker 1>maintain healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy body.</v>

1143
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're constantly pulling.</v>

1144
00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:19.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

1145
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:20.184
<v Speaker 1>I'm always pulling for my sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then I tried to do a little bit of </v>

1146
00:46:22.051 --> 00:46:24.420
<v Speaker 1>pushing and core just to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things stay balanced out.</v>

1147
00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:26.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that something you talk to a physical</v>

1148
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:28.260
<v Speaker 1>therapist about or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1149
00:46:28.261 --> 00:46:30.750
<v Speaker 1>that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just basic physiology.</v>

1150
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:31.584
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you only pull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to push sometimes throws you </v>

1151
00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:35.790
<v Speaker 1>wind up all imbalanced and injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1152
00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:36.663
<v Speaker 1>I saw the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things in the film was when </v>

1153
00:46:38.161 --> 00:46:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you were recovering from your ankle </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprain and you know,</v>

1154
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 1>you had said that you really hadn't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>injured in years.</v>

1155
00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden you have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend and she doesn't climb and you</v>

1156
00:46:48.211 --> 00:46:50.340
<v Speaker 1>get injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1157
00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually is just free.</v>

1158
00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Free timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God luck.</v>

1159
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:54.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just unfortunate because I think </v>

1160
00:46:55.981 --> 00:46:56.814
<v Speaker 1>really it just shows that I've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>really fortunate for 20 years that I've </v>

1161
00:46:58.591 --> 00:47:01.130
<v Speaker 1>had very few injuries climbing and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1162
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.090
<v Speaker 1>at some point you just have a few in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1163
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's just life to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you do have something like that</v>

1164
00:47:07.261 --> 00:47:10.350
<v Speaker 1>and you feel sort of the vulnerability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your tissue and your,</v>

1165
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:13.140
<v Speaker 1>do you think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1166
00:47:13.141 --> 00:47:18.141
<v Speaker 1>what if this happened halfway up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some fucking insane path?</v>

1167
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:19.091
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1168
00:47:19.091 --> 00:47:20.920
<v Speaker 1>the bigger thing in the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1169
00:47:20.921 --> 00:47:21.754
<v Speaker 1>I have a back injury earlier where I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowered off the end of the rope and </v>

1170
00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:26.280
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only fell maybe 10 or 12 feet,</v>

1171
00:47:26.281 --> 00:47:27.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorta like the height of this,</v>

1172
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:28.530
<v Speaker 1>this room basically.</v>

1173
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:29.823
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I landed sort of like folded over </v>

1174
00:47:31.421 --> 00:47:33.400
<v Speaker 1>this rock backward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like totally horrible,</v>

1175
00:47:33.401 --> 00:47:36.670
<v Speaker 1>like these jagged good boulders and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I didn't go that far,</v>

1176
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.590
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1177
00:47:38.591 --> 00:47:39.424
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got worked and it was really sobering </v>

1178
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.240
<v Speaker 1>because it made me realize that if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>fell from 40 feet climbing,</v>

1179
00:47:46.650 --> 00:47:47.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

1180
00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.370
<v Speaker 1>it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1181
00:47:48.371 --> 00:47:50.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean it'd be a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're basically are,</v>

1182
00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 1>it made me realize just how fragile my </v>
<v Speaker 1>body is because I'm like,</v>

1183
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:53.884
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only fell a little tiny ways and it </v>

1184
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:58.720
<v Speaker 1>really hurt pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1185
00:47:58.721 --> 00:47:59.710
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fell much further,</v>

1186
00:47:59.711 --> 00:48:00.544
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

1187
00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.370
<v Speaker 1>anything could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1188
00:48:03.850 --> 00:48:08.090
<v Speaker 1>People step off stairs wrong and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1189
00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.410
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The body's so fragile.</v>

1190
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:12.370
<v Speaker 1>It's really amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1191
00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.480
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's so fragile.</v>

1192
00:48:13.481 --> 00:48:15.280
<v Speaker 1>But then also so robust in some ways.</v>

1193
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.113
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing what the human body can </v>

1194
00:48:17.081 --> 00:48:19.450
<v Speaker 1>adapt to or withstand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then yeah,</v>

1195
00:48:19.451 --> 00:48:21.370
<v Speaker 1>and then some things just cannot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:48:21.371 --> 00:48:22.960
<v Speaker 1>That's why I was asking you about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>age,</v>

1197
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.823
<v Speaker 1>like as you get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you seeing a difference in the way </v>

1198
00:48:26.291 --> 00:48:27.124
<v Speaker 1>you recover?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you seeing differences in the way </v>

1199
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what your body,</v>

1200
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.480
<v Speaker 1>what you feel like your potential is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1201
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:36.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say.</v>

1202
00:48:36.131 --> 00:48:36.964
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1203
00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:37.811
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1204
00:48:37.811 --> 00:48:39.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are the tough questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1205
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

1206
00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Sure you think about this stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was a fighter a fighter at your age?</v>

1207
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Thirty three?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said.</v>

1208
00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:46.333
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you start tailing off like </v>

1209
00:48:48.701 --> 00:48:51.100
<v Speaker 1>winding down 34,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 on a fighter,</v>

1210
00:48:51.101 --> 00:48:53.050
<v Speaker 1>hits like 36.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like yikes.</v>

1211
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.610
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like old for fighter?</v>

1212
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:57.910
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare.</v>

1213
00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:58.833
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few guys who've been able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to compete at a world class level past </v>

1214
00:49:01.661 --> 00:49:02.140
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1215
00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:05.170
<v Speaker 1>And MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Randy coture stands out and boxing.</v>

1216
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Hopkins stands out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old is the Floyd Mayweather?</v>

1217
00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:10.710
<v Speaker 1>He's 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1218
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Is he still considered like fighting an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elite level?</v>

1219
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:14.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1220
00:49:14.771 --> 00:49:15.604
<v Speaker 1>when he fought conor mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor was nowhere near his </v>

1221
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.440
<v Speaker 1>level because conor mcgregor wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really a box.</v>

1222
00:49:20.441 --> 00:49:24.160
<v Speaker 1>He's on boxer and so floyd just kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked him.</v>

1223
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.200
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't really fought at a world class</v>

1224
00:49:29.201 --> 00:49:32.000
<v Speaker 1>level for a couple of years because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1225
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:33.063
<v Speaker 1>he beat Canelo Alvarez several years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>and made Canelo drop a ton of weight </v>

1226
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:37.503
<v Speaker 1>when he beat Manny Pacquiao.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manny Pacquiao was quite a bit past his </v>

1227
00:49:39.551 --> 00:49:40.384
<v Speaker 1>prime and had a shoulder injury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you probably dealing with like three </v>

1228
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:48.340
<v Speaker 1>years or so since he's fought like real </v>
<v Speaker 1>world class competition.</v>

1229
00:49:48.490 --> 00:49:50.530
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you say you made them drop lunch,</v>

1230
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:52.190
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean like to.</v>

1231
00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.040
<v Speaker 1>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clever.</v>

1232
00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:54.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1233
00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:58.000
<v Speaker 1>he wanted him to fight at a lower weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

1234
00:49:58.170 --> 00:49:59.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because floyd really,</v>

1235
00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:02.920
<v Speaker 1>floyd started off his career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to say at 1:30.</v>

1236
00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Then he fought at 1:45.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1237
00:50:04.931 --> 00:50:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his real isn't any big.</v>

1238
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.850
<v Speaker 1>How big is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least a very small five,</v>

1239
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.810
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

1240
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.490
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe five,</v>

1241
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 1>seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiny little hands on.</v>

1242
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Very small hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But certainly they hit very hard.</v>

1243
00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not a very fast,</v>

1244
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:23.380
<v Speaker 1>he's just a genius boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably one of the best defense,</v>

1245
00:50:23.381 --> 00:50:24.214
<v Speaker 1>probably if not the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely top two or three boxers of </v>

1246
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:28.784
<v Speaker 1>all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only been really hit hard to the </v>

1247
00:50:30.891 --> 00:50:33.040
<v Speaker 1>point where it's been wobbled like maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>like four,</v>

1248
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.883
<v Speaker 1>four times his entire career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like that's the kind of box </v>

1249
00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:38.950
<v Speaker 1>that you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1250
00:50:38.951 --> 00:50:40.760
<v Speaker 1>You know what it'd be like the rocky </v>
<v Speaker 1>Balboa styled,</v>

1251
00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:41.753
<v Speaker 1>so that just gets beaten to death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you want to be as boring really </v>

1252
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:49.190
<v Speaker 1>frigging watching NFL games with good </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense and you're like,</v>

1253
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:50.053
<v Speaker 1>oh man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like not the team you want to </v>

1254
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:52.400
<v Speaker 1>watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably the better team.</v>

1255
00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:53.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well especially with boxing because the </v>

1256
00:50:55.881 --> 00:50:58.670
<v Speaker 1>consequences are so grave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you hit a lot,</v>

1257
00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:00.093
<v Speaker 1>there was a horrible video that I put up</v>
<v Speaker 1>on youtube or on twitter rather than a </v>

1258
00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:03.974
<v Speaker 1>retweeted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone sent me and it's boxers when </v>

1259
00:51:06.411 --> 00:51:11.360
<v Speaker 1>they're young talking versus after </v>
<v Speaker 1>injuries and you're watching,</v>

1260
00:51:11.361 --> 00:51:12.710
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>

1261
00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.980
<v Speaker 1>It's stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like nfl stuff too.</v>

1262
00:51:15.981 --> 00:51:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1263
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.673
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people talk about that with </v>

1264
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:19.731
<v Speaker 1>climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1265
00:51:19.731 --> 00:51:20.870
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's such a dangerous sport,</v>

1266
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:21.704
<v Speaker 1>but the thing about rock climbing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's basically a completely safe </v>

1267
00:51:24.051 --> 00:51:24.884
<v Speaker 1>sport right up until some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident may happen and then then you </v>

1268
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:28.573
<v Speaker 1>potentially die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so the thing is you can basically </v>

1269
00:51:29.991 --> 00:51:33.530
<v Speaker 1>climb at a high level for 50 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>never have any issues or you could maybe</v>

1270
00:51:33.531 --> 00:51:34.364
<v Speaker 1>die doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of a fundamentally safe </v>

1271
00:51:36.531 --> 00:51:39.440
<v Speaker 1>sport for the most part as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about,</v>

1272
00:51:39.441 --> 00:51:42.950
<v Speaker 1>like fighting or a football or things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that were like,</v>

1273
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:46.340
<v Speaker 1>or even mountain biking where you're for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure going to get injured like no matter</v>

1274
00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by,</v>

1275
00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.340
<v Speaker 1>just by playing the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1276
00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:52.970
<v Speaker 1>like football and fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they creep up on you,</v>

1277
00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:55.250
<v Speaker 1>like the injuries start to pile.</v>

1278
00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.790
<v Speaker 1>But basically just even in practice you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are getting injured constantly,</v>

1279
00:51:58.791 --> 00:51:59.660
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

1280
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:03.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's Kinda messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the price of entry is going to</v>

1281
00:52:03.621 --> 00:52:05.780
<v Speaker 1>be freaking head injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:52:05.781 --> 00:52:06.614
<v Speaker 1>I went to a football game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the day high school football </v>

1283
00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.360
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1284
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.520
<v Speaker 1>when I was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1285
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I had a really hard time watching it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody's cheering and um,</v>

1286
00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.950
<v Speaker 1>and I was talking to my friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1287
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:17.560
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1288
00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:18.543
<v Speaker 1>no one's messed up here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These kids are getting brain damage and </v>

1289
00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.373
<v Speaker 1>this is like a really nice private </v>
<v Speaker 1>school where they pay a lot of money to </v>

1290
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:28.490
<v Speaker 1>get the kids into this program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the kids are playing football.</v>

1291
00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are all getting brain damage.</v>

1292
00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:31.701
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

1293
00:52:31.701 --> 00:52:32.151
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1294
00:52:32.151 --> 00:52:32.981
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1295
00:52:32.981 --> 00:52:35.720
<v Speaker 1>do you see that collision?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's brain damage.</v>

1296
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.420
<v Speaker 1>That's definitely brain damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not be a lot.</v>

1297
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:39.313
<v Speaker 1>They might be okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how many of those do they do in a </v>

1298
00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:42.510
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many do they do?</v>

1299
00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:44.370
<v Speaker 1>How many a month?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many are there?</v>

1300
00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.160
<v Speaker 1>What are ways to human potential right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

1301
00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1302
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:48.200
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1303
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:52.950
<v Speaker 1>the problem is it's such a grand part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our history and our culture,</v>

1304
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.290
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't really need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1305
00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:56.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>football hasn't existed that alarm.</v>

1306
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1307
00:52:56.811 --> 00:52:57.660
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1308
00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

1309
00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched a Rodeo from like very,</v>

1310
00:53:02.511 --> 00:53:05.240
<v Speaker 1>very close basically like from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>commentators box,</v>

1311
00:53:05.241 --> 00:53:06.074
<v Speaker 1>like above the pens for the fourth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>July Rodeo in Wyoming like two summers </v>

1312
00:53:10.971 --> 00:53:12.890
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was something I was like,</v>

1313
00:53:12.891 --> 00:53:14.240
<v Speaker 1>this is messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1314
00:53:14.250 --> 00:53:15.083
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not like huge animal rights guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm vegetarian obviously and I sort </v>

1315
00:53:17.421 --> 00:53:18.770
<v Speaker 1>of care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

1316
00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1317
00:53:19.491 --> 00:53:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of abusing these animals for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport and that's like,</v>

1318
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:26.270
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sit that well with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what was even worse,</v>

1319
00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.153
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these young men are getting worked </v>

1320
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:31.680
<v Speaker 3>just like for the entertainment is </v>
<v Speaker 3>totally like Roman gladiator type stuff.</v>

1321
00:53:31.681 --> 00:53:33.790
<v Speaker 3>And I was just like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's weird because it's so cultural,</v>

1322
00:53:33.791 --> 00:53:34.624
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

1323
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.060
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1324
00:53:36.061 --> 00:53:36.894
<v Speaker 3>I mean I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can empathize because obviously I'm </v>

1325
00:53:38.131 --> 00:53:41.990
<v Speaker 3>doing something that's also sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bloodsport he to some extent and,</v>

1326
00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 3>and sort of for the same reason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1327
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:44.304
<v Speaker 3>you're a teenage do look into do </v>
<v Speaker 3>something interesting and engaging </v>

1328
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:49.530
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will hopefully get you laid,</v>

1329
00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you just want to.</v>

1330
00:53:51.001 --> 00:53:51.834
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're from small town Wyoming and </v>

1331
00:53:52.621 --> 00:53:53.041
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1332
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:53.874
<v Speaker 3>I'm good at riding bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that's for sure going to be your </v>

1333
00:53:56.161 --> 00:53:57.000
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1334
00:53:57.001 --> 00:53:57.834
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just too bad that that's your </v>

1335
00:53:58.411 --> 00:54:00.090
<v Speaker 3>path.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a path.</v>

1336
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:03.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean we watched this guy get fricking </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown off this bowl and um,</v>

1337
00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:04.760
<v Speaker 3>and I think he was fine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1338
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:05.603
<v Speaker 3>he landed on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then the bowl for Canada was </v>

1339
00:54:06.541 --> 00:54:10.290
<v Speaker 3>charging him and the guy like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen human terror,</v>

1340
00:54:10.291 --> 00:54:12.540
<v Speaker 3>like he basically just turned and ran as</v>
<v Speaker 3>fast as he could,</v>

1341
00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:13.374
<v Speaker 3>but he ran straight into this post,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like headfirst into this frickin steel </v>

1342
00:54:15.901 --> 00:54:17.340
<v Speaker 3>posts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the edge of the.</v>

1343
00:54:17.790 --> 00:54:19.170
<v Speaker 3>Because he just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1344
00:54:19.171 --> 00:54:20.004
<v Speaker 3>it was like the bolts coming at him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He like turns it around and you </v>

1345
00:54:22.031 --> 00:54:23.790
<v Speaker 3>basically like knocks himself out </v>
<v Speaker 3>against this post.</v>

1346
00:54:23.791 --> 00:54:25.890
<v Speaker 3>And thankfully the clowns distracted the</v>
<v Speaker 3>bowl.</v>

1347
00:54:25.891 --> 00:54:26.724
<v Speaker 3>And then the paramedics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he believed there was a brigade </v>

1348
00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:31.350
<v Speaker 3>ambulance basically parked on the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>side of the fence from what you read do.</v>

1349
00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:32.453
<v Speaker 3>And so they basically like lift him over</v>
<v Speaker 3>and put them straight on the stretcher </v>

1350
00:54:35.221 --> 00:54:37.470
<v Speaker 3>and take them away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I was like dude,</v>

1351
00:54:37.471 --> 00:54:39.180
<v Speaker 3>and you know the crowds all like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1352
00:54:39.181 --> 00:54:42.030
<v Speaker 3>and you're just like that guys like </v>
<v Speaker 3>messed up like that,</v>

1353
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:43.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything about it made me like,</v>

1354
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:45.900
<v Speaker 3>feel kind of gross,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1355
00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:46.973
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not like I would never want to pay </v>

1356
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:50.540
<v Speaker 3>to watch somebody hurt themselves or </v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

1357
00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:51.383
<v Speaker 3>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it's weird that that's culturally </v>

1358
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:55.500
<v Speaker 3>acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like bullfighting is not.</v>

1359
00:54:55.860 --> 00:54:56.750
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they're totally.</v>

1360
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:58.530
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bull riding.</v>

1361
00:54:58.531 --> 00:55:00.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like they're fricking tasing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bowls that are like,</v>

1362
00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:01.493
<v Speaker 3>aren't they tying off their balls and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're doing all kinds of things and </v>

1363
00:55:03.081 --> 00:55:03.914
<v Speaker 3>some bad things too though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People argue that the polls have great </v>

1364
00:55:06.061 --> 00:55:06.780
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1365
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:09.510
<v Speaker 3>they feed them well and they get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of exercise and they're very happy bowls</v>

1366
00:55:09.511 --> 00:55:10.380
<v Speaker 3>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1367
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure they'd rather be roaming</v>
<v Speaker 3>the open plains,</v>

1368
00:55:12.691 --> 00:55:14.830
<v Speaker 3>like inseminating cows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1369
00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's weird.</v>

1370
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Justification.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1371
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.690
<v Speaker 3>We had a guy on fear factor</v>

1372
00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:19.533
<v Speaker 2>for once that was a professional rodeo </v>
<v Speaker 2>guy and his shoulder was like a </v>

1373
00:55:23.711 --> 00:55:28.711
<v Speaker 2>topographic map and he had so many scars</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his shoulder and he told me,</v>

1374
00:55:28.781 --> 00:55:29.614
<v Speaker 2>you show that would just pop out just </v>
<v Speaker 2>like he could just pop it out left and </v>

1375
00:55:32.381 --> 00:55:33.214
<v Speaker 2>right from just being destroyed like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ford by bolts falling and getting it </v>

1376
00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:40.700
<v Speaker 2>ripped apart or riding bowls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1377
00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1378
00:55:41.291 --> 00:55:43.390
<v Speaker 2>I just don't get that just wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>working anymore.</v>

1379
00:55:43.391 --> 00:55:46.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean he had a bunch of surgeries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they tried to screw it back together and</v>

1380
00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.300
<v Speaker 2>tighten things down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just destroyed.</v>

1381
00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:51.460
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a bull rider would look at free</v>

1382
00:55:51.461 --> 00:55:52.294
<v Speaker 3>soloing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It'd be like,</v>

1383
00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.530
<v Speaker 3>what a crazy dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1384
00:55:53.531 --> 00:55:55.050
<v Speaker 3>everybody looks at another sport and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like,</v>

1385
00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:55.893
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And honestly I look at fighting and I'm </v>

1386
00:55:56.801 --> 00:55:58.180
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems totally outrageous.</v>

1387
00:55:58.450 --> 00:55:59.283
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why would you want some other dude beat </v>

1388
00:56:00.071 --> 00:56:01.810
<v Speaker 3>you to death in a cage?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1389
00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.730
<v Speaker 3>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's outrageous.</v>

1390
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.280
<v Speaker 3>It is outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you can get good enough where you</v>

1391
00:56:06.281 --> 00:56:09.150
<v Speaker 3>can avoid getting damage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1392
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:13.510
<v Speaker 3>And then the tool to land the damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda the same,</v>

1393
00:56:13.511 --> 00:56:15.230
<v Speaker 3>but even landing the damage to a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>extent,</v>

1394
00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:15.611
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1395
00:56:15.611 --> 00:56:17.800
<v Speaker 3>you're hurting somebody else for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pleasure of the crowd.</v>

1396
00:56:17.801 --> 00:56:18.910
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's Kinda messed up.</v>

1397
00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:21.580
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird feeling.</v>

1398
00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 3>Knocking someone is one of the</v>

1399
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.910
<v Speaker 1>weirdest feelings because a part of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>is happy that it's not you,</v>

1400
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:28.953
<v Speaker 1>but part of you is like looking down </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that guy that's just got flatlined </v>

1401
00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.480
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1402
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.140
<v Speaker 1>that could have been made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much to fighters?</v>

1403
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:38.290
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold back,</v>

1404
00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.213
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like you kind of have to </v>

1405
00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:40.663
<v Speaker 1>like go to the death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then if you actually like punch </v>

1406
00:56:42.281 --> 00:56:43.810
<v Speaker 1>somebody so hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they died or something.</v>

1407
00:56:43.811 --> 00:56:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously you'd feel horrible or </v>
<v Speaker 1>it will.</v>

1408
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:48.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't look back at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's insane.</v>

1409
00:56:48.130 --> 00:56:49.750
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you don't hold back at all,</v>

1410
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:52.450
<v Speaker 1>but then if you actually killed somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you feel horrible.</v>

1411
00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.810
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that someone dies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed martial arts,</v>

1412
00:56:55.811 --> 00:56:57.280
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah.</v>

1413
00:56:57.281 --> 00:56:58.290
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know that,</v>

1414
00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely possible.</v>

1415
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 1>And it has happened and it's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it has happened very,</v>

1416
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:06.670
<v Speaker 1>very rarely in mixed martial arts.</v>

1417
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Never in the UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in boxing it happens more often.</v>

1418
00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:13.240
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why it happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>more often in boxing because you're only</v>

1419
00:57:13.241 --> 00:57:16.510
<v Speaker 1>punching in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're taking people down.</v>

1420
00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:17.373
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are tapping out cause they're </v>

1421
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:19.030
<v Speaker 1>paying them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

1422
00:57:19.031 --> 00:57:21.790
<v Speaker 1>It's also there's more options to defend</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1423
00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:24.160
<v Speaker 1>You're not just getting battered against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ropes.</v>

1424
00:57:24.370 --> 00:57:25.203
<v Speaker 1>They're also nowadays much better at </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping a fight when a fighter's </v>

1425
00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:32.140
<v Speaker 1>clearly compromised when they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really fucked up.</v>

1426
00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:35.350
<v Speaker 1>In the old days they used to let guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>just get battered.</v>

1427
00:57:35.470 --> 00:57:38.560
<v Speaker 1>They're just a box that doesn't sit well</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

1428
00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

1429
00:57:39.730 --> 00:57:40.563
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I'm not a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the thing about climbing is </v>

1430
00:57:44.231 --> 00:57:45.064
<v Speaker 1>there's this real elemental appeal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>just you and the mountain and it's </v>

1431
00:57:48.101 --> 00:57:50.980
<v Speaker 1>nature and it's beautiful and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful and calm.</v>

1432
00:57:50.981 --> 00:57:51.814
<v Speaker 1>It's like so different than having </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people screaming at you as </v>

1433
00:57:54.011 --> 00:57:55.510
<v Speaker 1>you punch someone in the face over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

1434
00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1435
00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:59.680
<v Speaker 1>that's just not my scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1436
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:00.514
<v Speaker 1>did you see the economy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcgregor could be abnormal gromit off </v>

1437
00:58:02.121 --> 00:58:04.870
<v Speaker 1>fight where there's the big fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the cage.</v>

1438
00:58:04.900 --> 00:58:05.733
<v Speaker 1>Always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing where the guy vaults </v>

1439
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:08.590
<v Speaker 1>out of the cage and like starts bawling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1440
00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:10.480
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like wwe or whatever it was.</v>

1441
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:11.743
<v Speaker 1>When did they start breaking tables over</v>
<v Speaker 1>people crazier than that because it was </v>

1442
00:58:13.781 --> 00:58:14.591
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1443
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:15.341
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

1444
00:58:15.341 --> 00:58:16.174
<v Speaker 1>this is totally outrageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's funny is it became chaos </v>

1445
00:58:19.871 --> 00:58:24.871
<v Speaker 1>because a fight erupted outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>parameters of the fight.</v>

1446
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:27.900
<v Speaker 1>It was just more fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting.</v>

1447
00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.550
<v Speaker 1>You have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we paid for,</v>

1448
00:58:29.570 --> 00:58:30.800
<v Speaker 1>this isn't okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1449
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:33.130
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like fighting in the cage is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

1450
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:35.380
<v Speaker 1>This is lovely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because out of the cage,</v>

1451
00:58:35.381 --> 00:58:37.390
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out in the wild.</v>

1452
00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:40.360
<v Speaker 1>That's like out in the world fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that kind of messed up?</v>

1453
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely like he's a professional</v>

1454
00:58:42.551 --> 00:58:43.384
<v Speaker 1>fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fighting.</v>

1455
00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.020
<v Speaker 1>That's what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird though,</v>

1456
00:58:46.110 --> 00:58:48.970
<v Speaker 1>the whole list and then this is coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>from someone who's been involved in this</v>

1457
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:50.170
<v Speaker 1>my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

1458
00:58:50.410 --> 00:58:51.021
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1459
00:58:51.021 --> 00:58:51.854
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely see all the arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>against it and yet you still want to go </v>

1460
00:58:55.711 --> 00:58:56.544
<v Speaker 1>to trader when people in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't punch anybody in the face </v>

1461
00:58:59.021 --> 00:59:00.820
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still choke people.</v>

1462
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:03.070
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that seems totally fun.</v>

1463
00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.630
<v Speaker 1>The thing about the Jujitsu aspect of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you,</v>

1464
00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:09.850
<v Speaker 1>you really can tap out and stop and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't really get hurt.</v>

1465
00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:13.720
<v Speaker 1>You get hurt training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu's accidental for the most part.</v>

1466
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you train,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually better off training with</v>

1467
00:59:17.231 --> 00:59:19.810
<v Speaker 1>a black belt than you are with a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>belt doorway because.</v>

1468
00:59:19.811 --> 00:59:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1469
00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I get that blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have more control on,</v>

1470
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.870
<v Speaker 1>so they'll be fine with you.</v>

1471
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:25.830
<v Speaker 1>They'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll just tap you and yeah,</v>

1472
00:59:25.831 --> 00:59:27.830
<v Speaker 1>it was a white ball accident and kicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>you in the face and you're like,</v>

1473
00:59:27.850 --> 00:59:30.500
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spark really strong.</v>

1474
00:59:30.501 --> 00:59:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you get a white belt is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossfitter,</v>

1475
00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:34.690
<v Speaker 1>is fucking jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really strong guide.</v>

1476
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:35.563
<v Speaker 1>Just wants to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably were just grappling and </v>

1477
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:39.260
<v Speaker 1>then as a harm came out and I don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to do with it,</v>

1478
00:59:39.261 --> 00:59:40.630
<v Speaker 1>so I threw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1479
00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:41.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really unskilled guy who's extremely </v>

1480
00:59:44.061 --> 00:59:45.980
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's learning technique,</v>

1481
00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's also like a spazz is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous to roll.</v>

1482
00:59:49.281 --> 00:59:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

1483
00:59:50.330 --> 00:59:51.163
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to teach me to Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not me telling you if you did it </v>

1484
00:59:54.861 --> 00:59:55.694
<v Speaker 1>with me we'd be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you did it with someone who's a </v>

1485
00:59:57.381 --> 00:59:59.030
<v Speaker 1>real beginner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

1486
00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.760
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a strong beginner,</v>

1487
01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:04.160
<v Speaker 1>strong grip and no idea what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like,</v>

1488
01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:05.310
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

1489
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>The real problem would be if we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>both beginners yoga,</v>

1490
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:08.563
<v Speaker 1>that would be the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a strong spazz is not really not </v>

1491
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>going to work against the black belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a go.</v>

1492
01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the learning curve for climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who you don't want to.</v>

1493
01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.940
<v Speaker 1>Beginners going out and trying to climb </v>
<v Speaker 1>a mountain together.</v>

1494
01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>I would worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're climbing,</v>

1495
01:00:25.011 --> 01:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>do you ever climb?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like is there a chain like one person in</v>

1496
01:00:28.971 --> 01:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>front of you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you.</v>

1497
01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you climb up the rope,</v>

1498
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:33.523
<v Speaker 1>it's basically two people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One goes out first and then brings up </v>

1499
01:00:35.121 --> 01:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>the second because you're limited by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>length of the rope.</v>

1500
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>So basically one person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because at the end of the rope brings up</v>

1501
01:00:38.931 --> 01:00:39.764
<v Speaker 1>the next person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person that climbs through brings </v>

1502
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:41.804
<v Speaker 1>it up the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you dependent upon the holes that </v>

1503
01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>they put in when they put those bolts </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the cracks and bolts,</v>

1504
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>bolts and things are put in by the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>essential list.</v>

1505
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:51.830
<v Speaker 1>So the very first person to have ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>climbed the route,</v>

1506
01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 1>but then everybody thereafter is able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>just clip there.</v>

1507
01:00:55.070 --> 01:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Their equipment into the bolts are a use</v>
<v Speaker 1>preestablished anchors,</v>

1508
01:00:58.701 --> 01:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1509
01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:00.374
<v Speaker 1>So all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the roots are already established </v>

1510
01:01:01.671 --> 01:01:04.640
<v Speaker 1>and you can read a book that shows all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different routes.</v>

1511
01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:09.800
<v Speaker 1>So like El captain has something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>112 different roots of it and wow.</v>

1512
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:11.023
<v Speaker 1>And of those hundred and 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only 15 or so of them can be free </v>

1513
01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>climbed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is different than free soloing.</v>

1514
01:01:16.551 --> 01:01:17.384
<v Speaker 1>Free climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning just using your hands and your </v>

1515
01:01:18.201 --> 01:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>feet and you're still using a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still clipping into protection as</v>

1516
01:01:20.811 --> 01:01:21.644
<v Speaker 1>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're only using your hands and </v>

1517
01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>your feet to get you up as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like putting gear in.</v>

1518
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:27.800
<v Speaker 1>And then pulling on the gear which would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be considered cheating.</v>

1519
01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.053
<v Speaker 1>So of the 100 routes on Ocap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like 90 of them you have to </v>

1520
01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.553
<v Speaker 1>pull on the hardware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to like clip little ladders </v>

1521
01:01:34.761 --> 01:01:35.870
<v Speaker 1>into it and step on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1522
01:01:35.871 --> 01:01:36.704
<v Speaker 1>you have to hammer pecans in and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>clip into them and stand on and then </v>

1523
01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>hammer another town and step on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is no flip for.</v>

1524
01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just nothing to hold onto.</v>

1525
01:01:43.821 --> 01:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>It's too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

1526
01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:46.281
<v Speaker 1>so then there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1527
01:01:46.281 --> 01:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>something like 10 or 15 free climbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>routes where you can climate.</v>

1528
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.473
<v Speaker 1>And so with my big goal of trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>free Solo El cap to climbing without a </v>

1529
01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:53.984
<v Speaker 1>rope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was limited to just those 10 or 15 </v>

1530
01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>routes that are possible to climb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just with your hands and feet.</v>

1531
01:01:58.850 --> 01:02:01.400
<v Speaker 1>And how did you establish the one that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to proceed on?</v>

1532
01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically I just wanted them doing </v>

1533
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:08.120
<v Speaker 1>the easiest one because I'm basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to free climb El cap by</v>

1534
01:02:08.121 --> 01:02:08.954
<v Speaker 1>any means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the easiest one wound up being </v>

1535
01:02:10.791 --> 01:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>the most secure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best one for me.</v>

1536
01:02:12.860 --> 01:02:13.693
<v Speaker 1>How many people have done it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will Free Solo or free climb free solo </v>

1537
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>freestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1538
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody only web the only one.</v>

1539
01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why there's</v>

1540
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.090
<v Speaker 3>the film and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1541
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:24.150
<v Speaker 3>it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and nobody's ever even thought about it,</v>

1542
01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:25.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's considered.</v>

1543
01:02:25.651 --> 01:02:28.050
<v Speaker 3>It's not like something that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to do.</v>

1544
01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:29.330
<v Speaker 3>Now that you've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other,</v>

1545
01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.510
<v Speaker 3>other people that are considering it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really don't.</v>

1546
01:02:31.511 --> 01:02:32.344
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's almost more the opposite </v>

1547
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:33.930
<v Speaker 3>now that I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are like,</v>

1548
01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to do that every.</v>

1549
01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:36.723
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nobody even playing this game </v>

1550
01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:39.001
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Really.</v>

1551
01:02:39.001 --> 01:02:41.130
<v Speaker 3>There aren't that many high end free </v>
<v Speaker 3>soloist right now.</v>

1552
01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:46.160
<v Speaker 3>How many other um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to one or something really.</v>

1553
01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.033
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1554
01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:47.893
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if there are any others </v>
<v Speaker 3>really right now there's this guy brad </v>

1555
01:02:49.951 --> 01:02:50.784
<v Speaker 3>go right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the American guy who's been </v>

1556
01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.750
<v Speaker 3>freestyling at a pretty high level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but definitely he's a really good friend</v>

1557
01:02:54.751 --> 01:02:56.490
<v Speaker 3>of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not slandering him.</v>

1558
01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:57.271
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1559
01:02:57.271 --> 01:02:59.460
<v Speaker 3>but definitely at a very different level</v>
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>

1560
01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:00.420
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1561
01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:02.790
<v Speaker 3>like he would never even dream of </v>
<v Speaker 3>selling all cab.</v>

1562
01:03:02.850 --> 01:03:05.870
<v Speaker 3>So he's sort of starting out was not </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's starting out,</v>

1563
01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.713
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's a very good climber,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's been climbing with long time and </v>

1564
01:03:08.611 --> 01:03:10.710
<v Speaker 3>he's done all kinds of very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

1565
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.573
<v Speaker 3>But in terms of free soloing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he just doesn't need to push it </v>

1566
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:15.353
<v Speaker 3>as that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's almost like he dabbles in free </v>

1567
01:03:18.121 --> 01:03:19.170
<v Speaker 3>soloing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1568
01:03:19.171 --> 01:03:20.880
<v Speaker 3>Well I mean I dabble on free soloing as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

1569
01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:24.780
<v Speaker 3>I mean most of them I'm climbing with my</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends doing other things,</v>

1570
01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:25.883
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think most almost all climbers </v>

1571
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:28.404
<v Speaker 3>only dabbling free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So free soloing is sort of like one </v>

1572
01:03:30.031 --> 01:03:30.864
<v Speaker 3>discipline of climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when we were talking earlier about </v>

1573
01:03:32.281 --> 01:03:33.810
<v Speaker 3>the Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having multiple disciplines,</v>

1574
01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:35.203
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know there are many types of </v>

1575
01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:37.314
<v Speaker 3>climbing and most climbers do all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to some extent and free soloing </v>

1576
01:03:39.751 --> 01:03:43.200
<v Speaker 3>always represents sort of this small </v>
<v Speaker 3>specialty like extra style.</v>

1577
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.633
<v Speaker 3>So you do free climbing and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>also do the kind of climbing where you </v>

1578
01:03:47.521 --> 01:03:49.630
<v Speaker 3>have to put in those posts and stand on </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1579
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.600
<v Speaker 3>Our aid climbing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>artificial climate.</v>

1580
01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.070
<v Speaker 3>So I free climb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I aid climb.</v>

1581
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:55.120
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes I don't like to because it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>too much work,</v>

1582
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.400
<v Speaker 3>it's too much like construction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1583
01:03:56.401 --> 01:03:57.900
<v Speaker 3>you're like nailing things and standing </v>
<v Speaker 3>on.</v>

1584
01:03:57.901 --> 01:03:58.734
<v Speaker 3>It's like engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do that because sometimes that's </v>

1585
01:04:01.051 --> 01:04:04.250
<v Speaker 3>what it requires to get up big mountains</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we do that.</v>

1586
01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:07.360
<v Speaker 3>And you nail things and stand on them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you take them out as well?</v>

1587
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.213
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the second person takes them out so the </v>

1588
01:04:08.881 --> 01:04:12.030
<v Speaker 3>one person uses them to get up and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>once the rope is security above,</v>

1589
01:04:12.031 --> 01:04:14.130
<v Speaker 3>then the second person joins them and </v>
<v Speaker 3>remove them all.</v>

1590
01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:15.143
<v Speaker 3>And then you have all your gear back and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're able to do it again for the </v>

1591
01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:17.340
<v Speaker 3>next section.</v>

1592
01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 3>How much weight is that stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1593
01:04:19.411 --> 01:04:20.244
<v Speaker 3>it depends where it can be a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And certainly back in the day when </v>

1594
01:04:21.811 --> 01:04:23.550
<v Speaker 3>people were doing the first ascents of </v>
<v Speaker 3>El Cap,</v>

1595
01:04:23.551 --> 01:04:26.700
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's something like 40 pounds or </v>
<v Speaker 3>50 pounds of iron hanging off him.</v>

1596
01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:27.773
<v Speaker 3>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nowadays it's a lot lighter and you can </v>

1597
01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:29.910
<v Speaker 3>use better gear.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1598
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:31.320
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a lot,</v>

1599
01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:34.710
<v Speaker 3>but that's kind of the appeal of free </v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing or even free soloing means that</v>

1600
01:04:34.711 --> 01:04:36.270
<v Speaker 3>you have nothing on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1601
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:39.660
<v Speaker 3>how secure is that stuff that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>hammering in there?</v>

1602
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:41.160
<v Speaker 3>It depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It depends.</v>

1603
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:41.994
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's certainly stories of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people falling and ripping all this </v>

1604
01:04:43.811 --> 01:04:45.290
<v Speaker 3>stuff back up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1605
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:46.703
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes that's okay because if </v>

1606
01:04:47.761 --> 01:04:48.594
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're thousands of feet off the </v>

1607
01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:50.154
<v Speaker 3>ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can take that hundred foot fall and </v>

1608
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:53.790
<v Speaker 3>not touch anything and it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1609
01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.820
<v Speaker 3>But still not really earlier this </v>
<v Speaker 3>summer,</v>

1610
01:04:56.821 --> 01:04:58.820
<v Speaker 3>a county on the thing.</v>

1611
01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:00.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's all,</v>

1612
01:05:01.050 --> 01:05:02.100
<v Speaker 3>it's all well founded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1613
01:05:02.101 --> 01:05:04.610
<v Speaker 3>you just got to trust it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1614
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.670
<v Speaker 3>earlier this summer I was talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tommy Caldwell,</v>

1615
01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.420
<v Speaker 3>one of the best climbers in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the two of us did the speed record on</v>

1616
01:05:09.421 --> 01:05:10.254
<v Speaker 3>ocap cap earlier this year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so that's the two of us are tied </v>

1617
01:05:12.331 --> 01:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're using a rope,</v>

1618
01:05:13.381 --> 01:05:15.810
<v Speaker 3>we're using equipment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we're anything goes,</v>

1619
01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:16.644
<v Speaker 3>you're cheating as much as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as it trying to get from the bottom of </v>

1620
01:05:18.161 --> 01:05:18.994
<v Speaker 3>the cap to the top as fast as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is on a different route than the </v>

1621
01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:23.980
<v Speaker 3>one that I presented in the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1622
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:25.373
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were trying to go sub two hours and </v>

1623
01:05:26.171 --> 01:05:27.790
<v Speaker 3>we ultimately did it and 1:58</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was,</v>

1624
01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:29.560
<v Speaker 3>it was pretty awesome and we were really</v>
<v Speaker 3>psyched.</v>

1625
01:05:29.561 --> 01:05:32.410
<v Speaker 3>But along the way Tommy took 100 foot </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall at one point where he just,</v>

1626
01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:36.340
<v Speaker 3>I was talking about him with the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>one to 10 effort.</v>

1627
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:37.173
<v Speaker 3>He was climbing something that's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really easy and he was probably giving </v>

1628
01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 3>an effort of like two and he just </v>
<v Speaker 3>slipped,</v>

1629
01:05:41.290 --> 01:05:41.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

1630
01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

1631
01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:43.654
<v Speaker 3>he freakin whipped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You felt like a hundred feet just </v>

1632
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:47.950
<v Speaker 3>straight down the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't touch anything because I'll.</v>

1633
01:05:47.951 --> 01:05:49.960
<v Speaker 3>Cap is like a very clean vertical sheet </v>
<v Speaker 3>rock.</v>

1634
01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.880
<v Speaker 3>How long does it take to fall?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One hundred feet.</v>

1635
01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:53.640
<v Speaker 3>That's like several.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1636
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.190
<v Speaker 3>several seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1637
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:55.541
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1638
01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:57.040
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like four or five or something.</v>

1639
01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:02.080
<v Speaker 3>But you accelerated very quickly to </v>
<v Speaker 3>three long enough to be like,</v>

1640
01:06:02.081 --> 01:06:03.070
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to die.</v>

1641
01:06:04.050 --> 01:06:04.883
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1642
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:06.311
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Long enough.</v>

1643
01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:07.144
<v Speaker 3>So the reason he fell so far is because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we were doing this sort of complicated </v>

1644
01:06:09.611 --> 01:06:10.870
<v Speaker 3>maneuvers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1645
01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:13.180
<v Speaker 3>normally I would have a blade advice on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I basically,</v>

1646
01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:15.640
<v Speaker 3>it would be attached to the rope earlier</v>
<v Speaker 3>to like catch him,</v>

1647
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.520
<v Speaker 3>but I'd taken my blade of ice off and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just tied into the end.</v>

1648
01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:19.353
<v Speaker 3>So basically he fell on all the slack,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whipped through until it hit me at the </v>

1649
01:06:21.851 --> 01:06:24.010
<v Speaker 3>end of the rope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But so when he yelled,</v>

1650
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:26.320
<v Speaker 3>I basically had time to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1651
01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:28.120
<v Speaker 3>he's falling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like brace for impact.</v>

1652
01:06:28.121 --> 01:06:28.954
<v Speaker 3>Like knowing that in a second the rope </v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to come tight against the end </v>

1653
01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:31.834
<v Speaker 3>that I'm tied into basically jerk me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then thankfully there's enough drag </v>

1654
01:06:36.171 --> 01:06:37.004
<v Speaker 3>and the system that it didn't jerk me </v>
<v Speaker 3>off the stance that I was on or else I </v>

1655
01:06:38.831 --> 01:06:39.664
<v Speaker 3>would have gotten pulled like 15 feet </v>
<v Speaker 3>across the wall and it was all messed </v>

1656
01:06:41.111 --> 01:06:43.650
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when he's falling and you're,</v>

1657
01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:44.484
<v Speaker 3>you're realizing that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get yanked by his fault or you like </v>

1658
01:06:47.590 --> 01:06:48.970
<v Speaker 3>digging into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1659
01:06:48.971 --> 01:06:50.560
<v Speaker 3>basically I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1660
01:06:50.561 --> 01:06:52.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like brace yourself.</v>

1661
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:53.223
<v Speaker 3>Like I was in this position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was actually facing out away from the </v>

1662
01:06:55.301 --> 01:06:56.134
<v Speaker 3>wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like facing out towards the meadow </v>

1663
01:06:58.570 --> 01:07:01.090
<v Speaker 3>because I was in an open corner.</v>

1664
01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.710
<v Speaker 3>Like if you look at the corner of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>room,</v>

1665
01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:05.510
<v Speaker 3>imagine one leg on each side facing </v>
<v Speaker 3>outward,</v>

1666
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.353
<v Speaker 3>like pushed into this position because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like I was about to have to untie </v>

1667
01:07:09.521 --> 01:07:10.354
<v Speaker 3>my knot and retire and do some things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so I was basically like already to </v>

1668
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:15.640
<v Speaker 3>do some things and all of a sudden I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear that he's falling and I was like,</v>

1669
01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:16.533
<v Speaker 3>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then like I was able to just sorta </v>

1670
01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.153
<v Speaker 3>like stick in there Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But my point is just that taking big </v>

1671
01:07:21.701 --> 01:07:22.534
<v Speaker 3>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you trust your equipment and </v>

1672
01:07:23.021 --> 01:07:23.854
<v Speaker 3>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can be okay to take big falls like </v>

1673
01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:26.674
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You obviously try to avoid them because </v>

1674
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had he hit a ledge or something,</v>

1675
01:07:29.831 --> 01:07:32.370
<v Speaker 3>then potentially he could have died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because it was,</v>

1676
01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:33.700
<v Speaker 3>it was clean there it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1677
01:07:34.210 --> 01:07:38.620
<v Speaker 3>So if he was in a situation where there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a slight angle and he fell that far,</v>

1678
01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.510
<v Speaker 3>that's where it's really dangerous.</v>

1679
01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:41.853
<v Speaker 3>I mean worst case scenario would be if </v>
<v Speaker 3>he fell 100 feet and 75 feet down there </v>

1680
01:07:45.191 --> 01:07:46.024
<v Speaker 3>was alleged sticking out how half the </v>
<v Speaker 3>width of this table because then you </v>

1681
01:07:48.161 --> 01:07:49.900
<v Speaker 3>would just clip it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd break both your legs,</v>

1682
01:07:49.901 --> 01:07:50.734
<v Speaker 3>everything would explode and then you'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>still know what do you do if you fall </v>

1683
01:07:56.231 --> 01:07:58.000
<v Speaker 3>and you break something and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>halfway up.</v>

1684
01:07:58.260 --> 01:07:59.110
<v Speaker 3>We'll do so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1685
01:07:59.111 --> 01:08:00.820
<v Speaker 3>Same route.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The nose of El Cap,</v>

1686
01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:01.654
<v Speaker 3>which we were trying to do the speed </v>
<v Speaker 3>record on this friend of mine who I </v>

1687
01:08:04.121 --> 01:08:06.390
<v Speaker 3>actually previously held the speed </v>
<v Speaker 3>record with this older guy,</v>

1688
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:07.780
<v Speaker 3>Hans flooring,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1689
01:08:08.050 --> 01:08:10.120
<v Speaker 3>who actually wrote the book how to speed</v>
<v Speaker 3>climb that.</v>

1690
01:08:10.121 --> 01:08:12.310
<v Speaker 3>I learned how to speed come from many </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1691
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.910
<v Speaker 3>So he freaking exactly what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>describing.</v>

1692
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:17.210
<v Speaker 3>Sort of worst case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took this 20,</v>

1693
01:08:17.230 --> 01:08:20.960
<v Speaker 3>probably a 22 foot fall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was unlucky enough,</v>

1694
01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:21.920
<v Speaker 3>which is totally fine.</v>

1695
01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:22.940
<v Speaker 3>He had a rope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You had gear.</v>

1696
01:08:22.941 --> 01:08:24.550
<v Speaker 3>Everything worked exactly the way it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>supposed to.</v>

1697
01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:25.800
<v Speaker 3>He just fell always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1698
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:26.743
<v Speaker 3>which is normal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the bummer was that there was a </v>

1699
01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:29.504
<v Speaker 3>little ledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably twice the size of that box </v>

1700
01:08:31.521 --> 01:08:32.810
<v Speaker 3>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that little wooden box,</v>

1701
01:08:32.811 --> 01:08:33.644
<v Speaker 3>just kind of this little thing sticking </v>
<v Speaker 3>out from the wall about this far that </v>

1702
01:08:35.721 --> 01:08:36.554
<v Speaker 3>basically he fell 20 feet hit that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>broke both of his ankles and then and </v>

1703
01:08:39.711 --> 01:08:43.190
<v Speaker 3>then went off in another two feet and so</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rope caught him and you know,</v>

1704
01:08:43.191 --> 01:08:45.560
<v Speaker 3>the fall was exactly as expected.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All his gear held.</v>

1705
01:08:45.561 --> 01:08:46.394
<v Speaker 3>Everything's totally normal except that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he happened to hit that thing right at </v>

1706
01:08:48.891 --> 01:08:52.130
<v Speaker 3>the apex of the full force of his fall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1707
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:54.560
<v Speaker 3>I hid that legend two feet below.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't matter at all.</v>

1708
01:08:54.561 --> 01:08:56.810
<v Speaker 3>He would just hidden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jumped off into space,</v>

1709
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.640
<v Speaker 3>but because you'd already fallen 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet,</v>

1710
01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.390
<v Speaker 3>broke both his ankles and then he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of horrible.</v>

1711
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 3>I was actually up higher on the wall </v>
<v Speaker 3>that day.</v>

1712
01:09:03.861 --> 01:09:04.694
<v Speaker 3>I'd come in from above to repel in and </v>
<v Speaker 3>work on something and I heard him </v>

1713
01:09:07.371 --> 01:09:08.204
<v Speaker 3>yelling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I thought he was just hooting and </v>

1714
01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:10.021
<v Speaker 3>hollering like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1715
01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:11.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how's it going type deal.</v>

1716
01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.253
<v Speaker 3>And then I like it climbed out to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>summit and then when I'd hiked halfway </v>

1717
01:09:13.971 --> 01:09:17.300
<v Speaker 3>back down I got a voicemail from him </v>
<v Speaker 3>saying that,</v>

1718
01:09:17.301 --> 01:09:17.780
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1719
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:18.321
<v Speaker 3>being like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1720
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:18.941
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Honda.</v>

1721
01:09:18.941 --> 01:09:20.780
<v Speaker 3>I think I've just broken my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my tip fib.</v>

1722
01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1723
01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:23.961
<v Speaker 3>basically like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1724
01:09:23.961 --> 01:09:25.040
<v Speaker 3>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can you help her with her?</v>

1725
01:09:25.050 --> 01:09:28.040
<v Speaker 3>He'd already called search and rescue </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so rescue is already mobilized,</v>

1726
01:09:28.041 --> 01:09:32.000
<v Speaker 3>but search and rescue in Yosemite,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really lead.</v>

1727
01:09:32.001 --> 01:09:34.100
<v Speaker 3>They're really fast but it's still sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of by the books,</v>

1728
01:09:34.101 --> 01:09:35.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it still takes kind of a lot of time.</v>

1729
01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.490
<v Speaker 3>And so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

1730
01:09:37.491 --> 01:09:38.324
<v Speaker 3>like maybe I should run back up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>repel down and like help my buddy repel </v>

1731
01:09:41.471 --> 01:09:42.610
<v Speaker 3>down the wall again or something.</v>

1732
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:43.453
<v Speaker 3>Try to like get them out of here faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>just because when search and rescue </v>

1733
01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:47.060
<v Speaker 3>mobilize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a long time.</v>

1734
01:09:47.061 --> 01:09:48.400
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he's in a lot of pain that,</v>

1735
01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:49.333
<v Speaker 3>that sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1736
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:51.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there as it,</v>

1737
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.140
<v Speaker 3>I really hesitated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wound up calling search and rescue and</v>

1738
01:09:54.141 --> 01:09:56.210
<v Speaker 3>talking to through them to see if there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was anything I could do to help.</v>

1739
01:09:56.211 --> 01:09:57.044
<v Speaker 3>But ultimately I want them just going </v>
<v Speaker 3>down because there wasn't really </v>

1740
01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:00.673
<v Speaker 3>anything for me to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's essentially just suspending for </v>

1741
01:10:02.451 --> 01:10:04.070
<v Speaker 3>awhile waiting for them to get them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:10:04.071 --> 01:10:07.370
<v Speaker 3>So he basically just sat on the ledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>with two broken legs for,</v>

1743
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:09.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six hours or 12 hours or something.</v>

1744
01:10:09.801 --> 01:10:10.634
<v Speaker 3>And then eventually they managed to haul</v>
<v Speaker 3>him up to the summit and then I think </v>

1745
01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:13.694
<v Speaker 3>they helicoptered him off the next </v>
<v Speaker 3>morning because it was already dark by </v>

1746
01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:17.490
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1747
01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:18.620
<v Speaker 3>I know it was kind of horrible.</v>

1748
01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.750
<v Speaker 3>But he sort of recovered by now it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been,</v>

1749
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.900
<v Speaker 3>it's been five months or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's back at it,</v>

1750
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:26.120
<v Speaker 3>always climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the manager of a climate.</v>

1751
01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.073
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1752
01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:28.341
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1753
01:10:28.341 --> 01:10:31.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's two broken bones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean worse,</v>

1754
01:10:31.930 --> 01:10:33.300
<v Speaker 3>it seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1755
01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.730
<v Speaker 3>super grim.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like.</v>

1756
01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.980
<v Speaker 3>But that's an example of sort of worst </v>
<v Speaker 3>case,</v>

1757
01:10:36.981 --> 01:10:38.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just bad luck.</v>

1758
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.230
<v Speaker 3>Well that's actually not worst case </v>
<v Speaker 3>right now that.</v>

1759
01:10:41.231 --> 01:10:42.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's not worst case.</v>

1760
01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:43.100
<v Speaker 3>That's just bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1761
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:44.803
<v Speaker 3>That's like when you're sitting there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're sitting there hanging off a </v>

1762
01:10:47.921 --> 01:10:50.810
<v Speaker 3>ledge like that with two broken ankles </v>
<v Speaker 3>for six hours.</v>

1763
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.673
<v Speaker 3>I mean that must be grim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't get to you the super groom </v>

1764
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:55.423
<v Speaker 3>swelling and yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think he and his partner actually </v>

1765
01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:57.794
<v Speaker 3>repelled down 100 feet to a slightly </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger ledge so that he could lay on it </v>

1766
01:11:00.291 --> 01:11:01.124
<v Speaker 3>and elevate his legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I think there were some other </v>

1767
01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:04.400
<v Speaker 3>climbers around that game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jacket,</v>

1768
01:11:04.401 --> 01:11:05.234
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he gets sort of bundle up and like </v>

1769
01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.390
<v Speaker 3>lay there and sort of manage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1770
01:11:08.391 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean it seems extremely character </v>
<v Speaker 3>building the life you choose.</v>

1771
01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1772
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:14.720
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really,</v>

1773
01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.553
<v Speaker 3>I'm that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that actually kind of makes me feel </v>

1774
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:17.790
<v Speaker 3>really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could just.</v>

1775
01:11:17.791 --> 01:11:18.624
<v Speaker 3>Because the like that kind of thing is </v>
<v Speaker 3>really close to home because he's a </v>

1776
01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:23.780
<v Speaker 3>friend and it's just so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1777
01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Not can only imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1778
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.943
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you think about your life and you </v>

1779
01:11:29.631 --> 01:11:32.800
<v Speaker 2>think about this stuff that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you do,</v>

1780
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:37.930
<v Speaker 2>is there a point where you feel like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't do it anymore or a point where you</v>

1781
01:11:38.241 --> 01:11:39.074
<v Speaker 2>feel like you want free solo anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or do you look at like your friend who </v>

1782
01:11:42.261 --> 01:11:43.094
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about who's older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's still free soloing and doing </v>

1783
01:11:45.741 --> 01:11:46.574
<v Speaker 2>difficult paths?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think this is just your life </v>

1784
01:11:47.871 --> 01:11:48.704
<v Speaker 2>forever?</v>

1785
01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1786
01:11:50.641 --> 01:11:52.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I honestly,</v>

1787
01:11:52.530 --> 01:11:53.363
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's my path forever </v>

1788
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:55.914
<v Speaker 3>necessarily just because there just </v>
<v Speaker 3>aren't always bigger and harder things </v>

1789
01:11:59.701 --> 01:12:01.260
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1790
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.920
<v Speaker 3>El Cap represented sort of the end of </v>
<v Speaker 3>this very long road for me.</v>

1791
01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sold many,</v>

1792
01:12:05.911 --> 01:12:06.744
<v Speaker 3>many things that we're all sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>leading towards El Cap and then I </v>

1793
01:12:08.641 --> 01:12:09.474
<v Speaker 3>finally did that and that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at least right now I can't really </v>

1794
01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:15.860
<v Speaker 3>imagine anything more inspiring to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1795
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.850
<v Speaker 3>in terms of reselling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there are plenty of other climate</v>

1796
01:12:17.851 --> 01:12:19.500
<v Speaker 3>challenges that I'm interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was just saying,</v>

1797
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:22.080
<v Speaker 3>doing the speed record is something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did this summer,</v>

1798
01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:23.110
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

1799
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:25.810
<v Speaker 2>is this like winning a big hand in Vegas</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you're just like,</v>

1800
01:12:25.811 --> 01:12:27.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we got all the money</v>

1801
01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:29.220
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out of here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1802
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.440
<v Speaker 3>because that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is too much luck.</v>

1803
01:12:31.441 --> 01:12:32.280
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1804
01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:35.130
<v Speaker 3>it's more like realizing a life dream </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're sort of like,</v>

1805
01:12:35.131 --> 01:12:35.920
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1806
01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.800
<v Speaker 3>boundary I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

1807
01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:38.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1808
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.080
<v Speaker 3>it's a similar idea where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1809
01:12:40.081 --> 01:12:40.920
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1810
01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:41.890
<v Speaker 3>it's not even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>

1811
01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1812
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:46.170
<v Speaker 3>it's a bad analogy just in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1813
01:12:46.230 --> 01:12:48.480
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no more big crazy risks.</v>

1814
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.943
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's the thing is that it's not </v>

1815
01:12:50.431 --> 01:12:52.500
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was never seen as a big crazy risk,</v>

1816
01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.334
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't what was or wasn't rolling the </v>

1817
01:12:54.331 --> 01:12:55.164
<v Speaker 3>dice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was sort of training for this thing </v>

1818
01:12:56.460 --> 01:12:57.293
<v Speaker 3>and then I did it and I'm just not sure </v>
<v Speaker 3>if there's a bigger thing that's worth </v>

1819
01:12:59.611 --> 01:13:01.160
<v Speaker 3>more effort,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1820
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:02.423
<v Speaker 3>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1821
01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:02.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1822
01:13:02.910 --> 01:13:05.190
<v Speaker 3>as you've seen the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like our relationship with my girlfriend</v>

1823
01:13:05.191 --> 01:13:06.024
<v Speaker 3>and she's great and we have this nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>life together and there's so much else </v>

1824
01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:10.440
<v Speaker 3>in climbing and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1825
01:13:10.441 --> 01:13:11.274
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe I'll never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>never seek out big free soloing </v>

1826
01:13:13.831 --> 01:13:15.270
<v Speaker 3>challenges again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1827
01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.133
<v Speaker 3>we'll see</v>

1828
01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:20.220
<v Speaker 2>now you're still relatively young in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of life itself.</v>

1829
01:13:20.250 --> 01:13:21.083
<v Speaker 2>Do you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think maybe there could be </v>

1830
01:13:22.411 --> 01:13:25.320
<v Speaker 2>something that you would enjoy as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>as you enjoy climbing?</v>

1831
01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:27.251
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1832
01:13:27.251 --> 01:13:28.870
<v Speaker 3>so no matter what I'll climb my whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1833
01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:29.704
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgetting,</v>

1834
01:13:29.710 --> 01:13:31.280
<v Speaker 3>I love climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even on the phone here,</v>

1835
01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:32.133
<v Speaker 3>I'm climbing in the gym everyday and </v>
<v Speaker 3>just for the movement of it just to </v>

1836
01:13:34.601 --> 01:13:35.980
<v Speaker 3>enjoy climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1837
01:13:35.981 --> 01:13:37.030
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1838
01:13:37.031 --> 01:13:37.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1839
01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:38.463
<v Speaker 3>I have a foundation that I've worked </v>
<v Speaker 3>with for the last five or six years </v>

1840
01:13:40.271 --> 01:13:42.790
<v Speaker 3>supporting solar around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1841
01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:45.040
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could see putting more and more effort</v>

1842
01:13:45.041 --> 01:13:45.670
<v Speaker 3>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1843
01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:46.503
<v Speaker 3>that's something that satisfying in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way that climbing sort of isn't because </v>

1844
01:13:50.201 --> 01:13:52.240
<v Speaker 3>it actually has a real tangible impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the world.</v>

1845
01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:53.603
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean climbing is really fulfilling </v>

1846
01:13:54.911 --> 01:13:57.250
<v Speaker 3>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when it's all said and done,</v>

1847
01:13:57.251 --> 01:13:58.730
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's just me going rock </v>
<v Speaker 3>climbing,</v>

1848
01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:00.640
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really matter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

1849
01:14:00.641 --> 01:14:02.080
<v Speaker 3>but at least working with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>foundation,</v>

1850
01:14:02.081 --> 01:14:03.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like actually doing something real.</v>

1851
01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:06.160
<v Speaker 3>What is your foundation?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the foundation,</v>

1852
01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:08.870
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been supporting solar all this.</v>

1853
01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:12.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you want the version is </v>
<v Speaker 3>basically uh,</v>

1854
01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:13.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking for some way to do </v>

1855
01:14:14.591 --> 01:14:15.424
<v Speaker 3>something positive in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was looking to support </v>

1856
01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:18.340
<v Speaker 3>environmental projects and then I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1857
01:14:18.341 --> 01:14:19.174
<v Speaker 3>there's no real point in supporting </v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental projects that don't also </v>

1858
01:14:20.981 --> 01:14:24.430
<v Speaker 3>support in like increased standard of </v>
<v Speaker 3>living that like help people in need.</v>

1859
01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:28.930
<v Speaker 3>And that sort of led me to solar </v>
<v Speaker 3>projects basically solar energy access.</v>

1860
01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:31.410
<v Speaker 3>And so that's what we in sport in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last five,</v>

1861
01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.253
<v Speaker 3>six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so what do you do with this project </v>

1862
01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:36.700
<v Speaker 3>was so domestically it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it mostly,</v>

1863
01:14:36.701 --> 01:14:41.350
<v Speaker 3>it's just been my way of donating my </v>
<v Speaker 3>money to two other projects that support</v>

1864
01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:43.410
<v Speaker 3>solar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'm domestically in the US,</v>

1865
01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.120
<v Speaker 3>I've been supporting this group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grid alternatives for example,</v>

1866
01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm in.</v>

1867
01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:48.971
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1868
01:14:48.971 --> 01:14:50.940
<v Speaker 3>I've done a few ins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>installations with them in,</v>

1869
01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:54.190
<v Speaker 3>in Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my hometown were basically low income</v>

1870
01:14:54.191 --> 01:14:55.024
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just gets a free home solar system on </v>

1871
01:14:56.351 --> 01:14:58.960
<v Speaker 3>their house and so it saves them the </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy bills,</v>

1872
01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:02.440
<v Speaker 3>but then also in terms of carbon </v>
<v Speaker 3>emissions is just,</v>

1873
01:15:02.441 --> 01:15:04.320
<v Speaker 3>it's good for the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1874
01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.550
<v Speaker 3>slowly greening the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

1875
01:15:07.060 --> 01:15:07.893
<v Speaker 3>and then the bigger potentially the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger impacts have been projects we've </v>

1876
01:15:12.731 --> 01:15:16.010
<v Speaker 3>been supporting in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just give access to solar lantern,</v>

1877
01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:16.844
<v Speaker 3>solar lights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to charge cell phones </v>

1878
01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.900
<v Speaker 3>basically like small scale systems that </v>
<v Speaker 3>was just a panel,</v>

1879
01:15:19.901 --> 01:15:22.570
<v Speaker 3>a battery and a few led lights and an </v>
<v Speaker 3>iphone charger.</v>

1880
01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:23.913
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but those kinds of things can </v>

1881
01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:26.290
<v Speaker 3>fundamentally change somebody's life </v>
<v Speaker 3>because,</v>

1882
01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:27.183
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>east Africa people can spend up to a </v>

1883
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:31.270
<v Speaker 3>quarter of their income on kerosene </v>
<v Speaker 3>light just to light their home,</v>

1884
01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:32.710
<v Speaker 3>which is totally outrageous.</v>

1885
01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:33.543
<v Speaker 3>I mean imagine spending that percentage </v>
<v Speaker 3>of your income just to have light after </v>

1886
01:15:35.951 --> 01:15:36.870
<v Speaker 3>dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1887
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.500
<v Speaker 3>and like an equatorial regions of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth.</v>

1888
01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:40.270
<v Speaker 3>It's dark for 12 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1889
01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:43.510
<v Speaker 3>imagine if when the sun goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your productive hours are done,</v>

1890
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.490
<v Speaker 3>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just going to sit in the dark for 12</v>

1891
01:15:45.491 --> 01:15:46.690
<v Speaker 3>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>

1892
01:15:46.691 --> 01:15:47.610
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1893
01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.513
<v Speaker 3>I mean there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a billion people on earth </v>

1894
01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:53.620
<v Speaker 3>living without access to power and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>mean it's hard not for.</v>

1895
01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:56.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean I kind of see that as a waste of </v>
<v Speaker 3>human potential to some extent.</v>

1896
01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:57.423
<v Speaker 3>Like it's just an unfortunate thing to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think there are so many people living </v>

1897
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:01.900
<v Speaker 3>without access to power.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1898
01:16:01.901 --> 01:16:03.730
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is crazy.</v>

1899
01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:06.820
<v Speaker 3>It's really crazy in California that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not more solar.</v>

1900
01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:08.650
<v Speaker 3>When you think about how often it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>sunny here,</v>

1901
01:16:08.910 --> 01:16:09.743
<v Speaker 3>he.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1902
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:10.833
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

1903
01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:12.240
<v Speaker 3>it's totally that.</v>

1904
01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:13.083
<v Speaker 3>I mean at least it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's growing very quickly in California </v>

1905
01:16:15.041 --> 01:16:15.874
<v Speaker 3>at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean really solar should be </v>

1906
01:16:17.561 --> 01:16:20.890
<v Speaker 3>powering the whole or I mean enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>sunlight hits the earth every.</v>

1907
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.233
<v Speaker 3>I don't know the terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's every like 10 or 15 minutes </v>

1908
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:26.230
<v Speaker 3>basically to power the earth for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the year.</v>

1909
01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 3>If you're able to harness all that </v>
<v Speaker 3>energy,</v>

1910
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.240
<v Speaker 3>just kind of like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just such a cleaner,</v>

1911
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:33.430
<v Speaker 3>simpler way of of powering the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1912
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>

1913
01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:38.740
<v Speaker 3>And I mean one can only hope that that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to.</v>

1914
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:40.993
<v Speaker 3>It's going to keep continue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna continue to evolve and the </v>

1915
01:16:43.961 --> 01:16:44.794
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that drives me absolutely </v>

1916
01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:46.834
<v Speaker 3>crazy is that it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally obvious that in 100 years </v>

1917
01:16:50.410 --> 01:16:53.770
<v Speaker 3>the earth will be run through solar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that because there's just so</v>

1918
01:16:53.771 --> 01:16:55.930
<v Speaker 3>much energy spilling onto the earth and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's free.</v>

1919
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:58.060
<v Speaker 3>And so the technology is only improving.</v>

1920
01:16:58.090 --> 01:17:00.040
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's adopting it like in 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years,</v>

1921
01:17:00.041 --> 01:17:02.080
<v Speaker 3>no question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything will be run from the sun.</v>

1922
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:03.723
<v Speaker 3>The thing that drives me insane is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much resistance to it from </v>

1923
01:17:05.801 --> 01:17:06.910
<v Speaker 3>utilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from,</v>

1924
01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:09.110
<v Speaker 3>from consumer ignorance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from whatever else,</v>

1925
01:17:09.111 --> 01:17:11.780
<v Speaker 3>but people just don't totally get it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of opposed to it.</v>

1926
01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.180
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1927
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:17.120
<v Speaker 3>half the world will be dragged kicking </v>
<v Speaker 3>and screaming into the future and you're</v>

1928
01:17:17.121 --> 01:17:17.954
<v Speaker 3>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just embrace it and get there in </v>

1929
01:17:18.831 --> 01:17:21.020
<v Speaker 3>15 years instead of 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all,</v>

1930
01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:23.870
<v Speaker 3>all the arguments about climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the arguments about,</v>

1931
01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>environmental degradation,</v>

1932
01:17:25.161 --> 01:17:27.430
<v Speaker 3>all those kinds of things will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>mitigated to a large extent.</v>

1933
01:17:27.431 --> 01:17:29.720
<v Speaker 3>And you sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there a downside to that?</v>

1934
01:17:29.721 --> 01:17:30.554
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like even if you don't believe in </v>

1935
01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:32.850
<v Speaker 3>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you know,</v>

1936
01:17:32.851 --> 01:17:35.180
<v Speaker 3>you denial the science behind it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think it's all bs.</v>

1937
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:36.343
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there really a downside to just </v>

1938
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:41.560
<v Speaker 3>adopting the future sooner?</v>
<v Speaker 3>For me it's like,</v>

1939
01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:42.613
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like one of those things where </v>

1940
01:17:42.861 --> 01:17:44.990
<v Speaker 3>you're sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if it's going to happen eventually,</v>

1941
01:17:44.991 --> 01:17:47.480
<v Speaker 3>let's just do it now and save all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fricken hassle again.</v>

1942
01:17:47.481 --> 01:17:47.820
<v Speaker 3>There.</v>

1943
01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the momentum of the current</v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

1944
01:17:49.681 --> 01:17:50.514
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult for people to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>abandoned established ways of doing </v>

1945
01:17:54.361 --> 01:17:55.460
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially down.</v>

1946
01:17:55.470 --> 01:17:57.180
<v Speaker 2>We're so hooked on fossil fuels.</v>

1947
01:17:57.250 --> 01:17:58.083
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like it's just such a bummer that </v>

1948
01:17:58.901 --> 01:18:00.460
<v Speaker 3>the status quo is such a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1949
01:18:00.461 --> 01:18:01.100
<v Speaker 3>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1950
01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:02.860
<v Speaker 3>that's the way we do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's just keep doing that.</v>

1951
01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:05.350
<v Speaker 3>And it's just weird because there's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>many things in life,</v>

1952
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:07.890
<v Speaker 3>the change so frequently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1953
01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.880
<v Speaker 3>like I mean the world is constantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing and you're like,</v>

1954
01:18:09.881 --> 01:18:12.880
<v Speaker 3>let's just embrace the changes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>matter the most and just do them faster.</v>

1955
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about was a guy who</v>

1956
01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:15.043
<v Speaker 2>he lives in a van and climbs rocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>business people that have thousands and </v>

1957
01:18:20.060 --> 01:18:20.893
<v Speaker 2>thousands of employees and millions if </v>
<v Speaker 2>not billions of money of dollars </v>

1958
01:18:23.721 --> 01:18:25.250
<v Speaker 2>invested in these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1959
01:18:25.251 --> 01:18:26.084
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1960
01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:30.110
<v Speaker 2>that's the problem with parents system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it's just too bad.</v>

1961
01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:31.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

1962
01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:32.750
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's inevitable.</v>

1963
01:18:32.751 --> 01:18:33.584
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's inevitable that we will embrace it </v>

1964
01:18:35.871 --> 01:18:36.704
<v Speaker 2>and change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

1965
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.863
<v Speaker 3>that's almost more frustrating though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is because it's inevitable and yet it's </v>

1966
01:18:40.151 --> 01:18:42.310
<v Speaker 3>going to be dragged out so long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're sort of like,</v>

1967
01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.650
<v Speaker 3>why can't people just embrace the </v>
<v Speaker 3>inevitability of it and just</v>

1968
01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:46.350
<v Speaker 2>move forward?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1969
01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I think they slowly are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but things like that take time.</v>

1970
01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:51.370
<v Speaker 2>I think one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one big thing is going to be if they can</v>

1971
01:18:51.371 --> 01:18:55.630
<v Speaker 2>ever figure out a way to solar power </v>
<v Speaker 2>cars as you're driving them,</v>

1972
01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:57.760
<v Speaker 2>so you never really have to concern </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

1973
01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll ever be a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1974
01:18:58.811 --> 01:19:01.480
<v Speaker 2>fisker figured out how to do it with </v>
<v Speaker 2>your stereo.</v>

1975
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:06.750
<v Speaker 2>They figured out how to do it with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio system and different kind of car.</v>

1976
01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:08.740
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a lot less energy,</v>

1977
01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:10.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's just the roof panel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The roof panel,</v>

1978
01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:11.963
<v Speaker 2>isn't that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't we?</v>

1979
01:19:11.970 --> 01:19:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1980
01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.630
<v Speaker 2>they are a weird company though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the company that,</v>

1981
01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:17.493
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years ago there was a big storm </v>

1982
01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:20.584
<v Speaker 2>that hit the east coast and they had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of cars parked at a dock and they </v>

1983
01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:25.340
<v Speaker 2>all exploded when the water hit them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they realize,</v>

1984
01:19:25.341 --> 01:19:25.721
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

1985
01:19:25.721 --> 01:19:26.111
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

1986
01:19:26.111 --> 01:19:28.960
<v Speaker 2>You can't get your things drenched in </v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

1987
01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:30.023
<v Speaker 2>Like when the water hit a certain level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they had a severe flaw and so they </v>

1988
01:19:34.511 --> 01:19:35.344
<v Speaker 2>burst into flames and exploded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's this whole like doc filled </v>

1989
01:19:40.631 --> 01:19:44.320
<v Speaker 2>with these fisker Karma Karmas that blew</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

1990
01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.600
<v Speaker 2>And they called them Karmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has even more hilarious.</v>

1991
01:19:46.601 --> 01:19:49.450
<v Speaker 2>You watch it exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty bad.</v>

1992
01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:52.390
<v Speaker 2>That's all bad all the way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1993
01:19:52.391 --> 01:19:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I think they've since fixed that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

1994
01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:55.960
<v Speaker 2>it was a big flaw.</v>

1995
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:57.530
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just actually reading,</v>

1996
01:19:57.531 --> 01:19:59.180
<v Speaker 3>I was reading this business management </v>
<v Speaker 3>book,</v>

1997
01:19:59.181 --> 01:20:00.014
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're talking about the Ford Pinto </v>

1998
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:02.143
<v Speaker 3>with a freaking gas tanks too close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the back bumper is based in your gas </v>

1999
01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:07.040
<v Speaker 3>tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>protected by nature</v>

2000
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.250
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of exploding cards,</v>

2001
01:20:11.251 --> 01:20:12.084
<v Speaker 1>but that actually I think killed lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people because they were actually put </v>

2002
01:20:14.161 --> 01:20:14.994
<v Speaker 1>into production and then there are tons </v>
<v Speaker 1>of accidents and the car's explode and </v>

2003
01:20:16.951 --> 01:20:18.510
<v Speaker 1>you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2004
01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:22.230
<v Speaker 1>that's been a bad decisions that an auto</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing.</v>

2005
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pinto was a disaster.</v>

2006
01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.940
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2007
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:30.450
<v Speaker 1>I think what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're capable of doing right now,</v>

2008
01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:31.284
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can power a car with </v>

2009
01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:36.210
<v Speaker 1>solar panels completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2010
01:20:36.211 --> 01:20:37.044
<v Speaker 1>you certainly can from your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was their initial claim when they </v>

2011
01:20:39.331 --> 01:20:40.164
<v Speaker 1>announced it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it would power the whole car and </v>

2012
01:20:42.001 --> 01:20:43.260
<v Speaker 1>everyone was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bullshit.</v>

2013
01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:44.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely a bullshit.</v>

2014
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

2015
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2016
01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:46.023
<v Speaker 1>I have to go two years ago they said </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could power the whole car with the </v>

2017
01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:51.090
<v Speaker 1>roof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>August of 2016.</v>

2018
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find a updates,</v>

2019
01:20:53.701 --> 01:20:54.330
<v Speaker 1>but that seems.</v>

2020
01:20:54.330 --> 01:20:56.340
<v Speaker 1>That seems totally outrageous because </v>
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>

2021
01:20:56.341 --> 01:20:59.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean the future of cars is born like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller car with no,</v>

2022
01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:00.023
<v Speaker 1>like a glass roof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Tesla style where it's sort of a </v>

2023
01:21:02.010 --> 01:21:02.843
<v Speaker 1>initial ad right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a roof create enough energy to power </v>

2024
01:21:06.331 --> 01:21:07.164
<v Speaker 1>the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No other vehicles sold in the US has </v>

2025
01:21:08.361 --> 01:21:10.060
<v Speaker 1>ever offered this capability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean,</v>

2026
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:11.003
<v Speaker 1>so that might be true if it just sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>parked in the sun for 12 hours and then </v>

2027
01:21:13.471 --> 01:21:16.710
<v Speaker 1>he drove home run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the driveway.</v>

2028
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:22.110
<v Speaker 1>You worked at night charges all day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your commutes really short.</v>

2029
01:21:22.111 --> 01:21:22.944
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the numbers don't really don't work </v>

2030
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:25.433
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would know better than anybody if </v>

2031
01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:28.440
<v Speaker 1>you're involved in solar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2032
01:21:28.890 --> 01:21:30.750
<v Speaker 1>but I mean there's solar panels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2033
01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:31.584
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy of mine that does a lot </v>

2034
01:21:32.461 --> 01:21:34.620
<v Speaker 1>of backpacking and he carries around </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2035
01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:35.454
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a foldable solar charger for </v>

2036
01:21:37.261 --> 01:21:38.094
<v Speaker 1>his phone and he folds it up and lays it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and then puts a charger there and </v>

2037
01:21:45.121 --> 01:21:47.070
<v Speaker 1>then he uses that charger to charge his </v>
<v Speaker 1>phone,</v>

2038
01:21:47.071 --> 01:21:51.900
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't like he'll go 20 plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>days with justice thing you want me to.</v>

2039
01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.270
<v Speaker 1>So I mentioned our expedition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Antarctica last winter,</v>

2040
01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:59.220
<v Speaker 1>so that's 24 hours of sunlight because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in Antarctica and in their summer</v>

2041
01:21:59.610 --> 01:22:00.443
<v Speaker 1>and our entire expedition was run from </v>
<v Speaker 1>solar and so we'd actually taken a </v>

2042
01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:05.400
<v Speaker 1>generator and the other guys on the trip</v>
<v Speaker 1>for oil,</v>

2043
01:22:05.401 --> 01:22:08.340
<v Speaker 1>for the generator basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it wasn't gonna work.</v>

2044
01:22:08.730 --> 01:22:09.481
<v Speaker 1>And so we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2045
01:22:09.481 --> 01:22:11.010
<v Speaker 1>I guess we'll have to try to use the </v>
<v Speaker 1>solar,</v>

2046
01:22:11.011 --> 01:22:12.780
<v Speaker 1>which has sort of been our backup </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2047
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:13.681
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually,</v>

2048
01:22:13.681 --> 01:22:16.230
<v Speaker 1>we ran the whole trip on solar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything worked in,</v>

2049
01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:18.070
<v Speaker 1>so they were filming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are a bunch of cameras,</v>

2050
01:22:18.071 --> 01:22:19.260
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laptops,</v>

2051
01:22:19.261 --> 01:22:20.940
<v Speaker 1>backing up drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2052
01:22:20.941 --> 01:22:22.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were flying a drone quite a bit for</v>

2053
01:22:22.621 --> 01:22:24.030
<v Speaker 1>aerial footage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is all kind of beautiful,</v>

2054
01:22:24.031 --> 01:22:26.460
<v Speaker 1>so I mean they basically ran this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation off solar.</v>

2055
01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:28.590
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the camera guys has got Pablo,</v>

2056
01:22:28.591 --> 01:22:29.080
<v Speaker 1>he's a good friend.</v>

2057
01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:29.913
<v Speaker 1>Mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm basically just had to wake up every </v>

2058
01:22:31.561 --> 01:22:34.650
<v Speaker 1>two hours to move the panels around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tent as the sun tracks around this guy,</v>

2059
01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it's always in full sun.</v>

2060
01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:37.883
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had to sleep with the batteries </v>

2061
01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:40.230
<v Speaker 1>and things to make sure things stay warm</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

2062
01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.130
<v Speaker 1>But otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2063
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean because it's really cold.</v>

2064
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:44.663
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny because you put your laptops </v>

2065
01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:46.194
<v Speaker 1>and stuff into coolers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in the ice chest to keep them </v>

2066
01:22:47.791 --> 01:22:48.624
<v Speaker 1>insulated enough to stay warm as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to cold water because the outside </v>

2067
01:22:51.301 --> 01:22:54.800
<v Speaker 1>temperature is so cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was cool though because you know,</v>

2068
01:22:54.820 --> 01:22:56.550
<v Speaker 1>that way we didn't have to run this like</v>
<v Speaker 1>loud,</v>

2069
01:22:56.551 --> 01:22:59.700
<v Speaker 1>stinky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>annoying generator in like you just have</v>

2070
01:22:59.701 --> 01:23:01.710
<v Speaker 1>your panels working fulltime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2071
01:23:01.711 --> 01:23:02.544
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the weird things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Tesla's when you drive it in and </v>

2072
01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.650
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2073
01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:06.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome.</v>

2074
01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much more peaceful.</v>

2075
01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:09.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2076
01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:10.533
<v Speaker 1>but that's the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you imagine a city that's </v>

2077
01:23:11.711 --> 01:23:13.690
<v Speaker 1>all silent electric cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no emissions.</v>

2078
01:23:13.691 --> 01:23:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean imagine how much more pleasant </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pedestrian experiences when they,</v>

2079
01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:19.540
<v Speaker 1>when it's not like diesel exhaust right </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to you on the city streets.</v>

2080
01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:20.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear the car that runs you </v>

2081
01:23:21.161 --> 01:23:24.060
<v Speaker 1>over or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you still do though because uh,</v>

2082
01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:26.110
<v Speaker 1>something like 30 percent of the noises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tires.</v>

2083
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:27.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like you still hear cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2084
01:23:28.050 --> 01:23:29.890
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just so much more mellow.</v>

2085
01:23:29.891 --> 01:23:32.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't hear like an engine like </v>
<v Speaker 1>ripping right by you.</v>

2086
01:23:32.530 --> 01:23:33.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's inevitable that we figured </v>

2087
01:23:34.271 --> 01:23:39.271
<v Speaker 1>out a way that you can just power </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything from solar and including cars</v>

2088
01:23:39.821 --> 01:23:41.100
<v Speaker 1>as you're driving them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2089
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:44.430
<v Speaker 1>don't make sense as the technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>improves mean.</v>

2090
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:45.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

2091
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:46.143
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's development in a solar </v>

2092
01:23:49.121 --> 01:23:52.810
<v Speaker 1>film sort of in windows like so imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>an office building where the windows are</v>

2093
01:23:52.811 --> 01:23:53.860
<v Speaker 1>all producing power.</v>

2094
01:23:54.020 --> 01:23:55.470
<v Speaker 1>So I mean if you think about that with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>

2095
01:23:55.471 --> 01:23:58.060
<v Speaker 1>if it's just like a glass dome over you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's all sort of producing power.</v>

2096
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.841
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'd be.</v>

2097
01:23:58.841 --> 01:24:01.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a watch that was on solar power.</v>

2098
01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not a lot of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

2099
01:24:04.661 --> 01:24:05.494
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really need any batteries for </v>

2100
01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Casio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2101
01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.153
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

2102
01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2103
01:24:11.470 --> 01:24:13.000
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty straightforward though.</v>

2104
01:24:13.001 --> 01:24:15.190
<v Speaker 1>It's a small amount of power that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing.</v>

2105
01:24:15.610 --> 01:24:17.980
<v Speaker 1>When you got involved in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2106
01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:20.680
<v Speaker 1>how much preparation did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2107
01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:21.514
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was,</v>

2108
01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.730
<v Speaker 1>what was the motivation for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation?</v>

2109
01:24:24.731 --> 01:24:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2110
01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:27.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

2111
01:24:27.461 --> 01:24:28.294
<v Speaker 1>I was just looking to do something </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive for the world and so exploring </v>

2112
01:24:31.241 --> 01:24:34.240
<v Speaker 1>options you will and so I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>start donating significant percentage of</v>

2113
01:24:34.241 --> 01:24:35.074
<v Speaker 1>my income to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to environmental nonprofits and then I </v>

2114
01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:40.440
<v Speaker 1>decided that I should do it in sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>public facing way in,</v>

2115
01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:41.533
<v Speaker 1>in the form of the foundation just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I felt like I'm never going to </v>

2116
01:24:44.021 --> 01:24:47.560
<v Speaker 1>have nearly as much money as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as real philanthropic organization,</v>

2117
01:24:47.561 --> 01:24:48.394
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the bill and Melinda Gates </v>

2118
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Foundation.</v>

2119
01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Like I'll never have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll never have real dollars like that,</v>

2120
01:24:52.781 --> 01:24:56.830
<v Speaker 1>but I do sort of have this platform like</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of public persona,</v>

2121
01:24:56.831 --> 01:24:58.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was like,</v>

2122
01:24:58.001 --> 01:24:58.834
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least if I donate things that I can </v>

2123
01:24:59.501 --> 01:25:01.930
<v Speaker 1>sort of leverage that in the right way </v>
<v Speaker 1>to contribute,</v>

2124
01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically try and maximize the good that</v>

2125
01:25:04.901 --> 01:25:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2126
01:25:06.131 --> 01:25:06.701
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2127
01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:07.534
<v Speaker 1>so then I just started researching </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations that I felt like we're </v>

2128
01:25:09.010 --> 01:25:13.030
<v Speaker 1>doing great work and that led me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solar basically does most of your income</v>

2129
01:25:13.031 --> 01:25:16.210
<v Speaker 1>come from sponsors and from public </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearances,</v>

2130
01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:20.650
<v Speaker 1>like how it was mostly sponsors and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sort of has shifted into sponsors and</v>

2131
01:25:20.651 --> 01:25:22.300
<v Speaker 1>sort of one off things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

2132
01:25:22.301 --> 01:25:23.134
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I published a book a few years ago and </v>

2133
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:28.540
<v Speaker 1>so there's an advanced from that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the film has made a little money,</v>

2134
01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:31.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the random little things in the now it's</v>

2135
01:25:31.601 --> 01:25:32.434
<v Speaker 1>also sort of split with corporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking type commercial opportunities </v>

2136
01:25:35.591 --> 01:25:36.424
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

2137
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:38.710
<v Speaker 1>So sponsorship is still probably the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest thing for me.</v>

2138
01:25:38.711 --> 01:25:40.420
<v Speaker 1>So like the northface been my biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsor,</v>

2139
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:42.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most important sponsor for me.</v>

2140
01:25:42.851 --> 01:25:45.430
<v Speaker 1>But then now it's sort of split between </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of different sources,</v>

2141
01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:49.840
<v Speaker 1>just sort of public speaking things have</v>
<v Speaker 1>these corporate appearances.</v>

2142
01:25:49.841 --> 01:25:50.674
<v Speaker 1>You just go and get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just talk to them about free solo </v>

2143
01:25:53.291 --> 01:25:55.420
<v Speaker 1>climbing and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to them about climate.</v>

2144
01:25:55.421 --> 01:25:58.420
<v Speaker 1>Talking about preparation or I mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on what somebody needs.</v>

2145
01:25:58.421 --> 01:25:59.254
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends what the organizations I've </v>

2146
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:01.143
<v Speaker 1>spoken to a bunch of a venture capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>firms about risk taking and risk </v>

2147
01:26:04.821 --> 01:26:06.740
<v Speaker 1>management or how that's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2148
01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:08.293
<v Speaker 1>so they just look at you as like sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an inspiration to mix things up for the </v>

2149
01:26:11.631 --> 01:26:12.470
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2150
01:26:12.471 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'd like to think that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly more interesting topic than the</v>

2151
01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:17.280
<v Speaker 1>average business speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2152
01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's certainly more beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>

2153
01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:19.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I,</v>

2154
01:26:19.641 --> 01:26:21.290
<v Speaker 1>if I give a nice slideshow and chat for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit,</v>

2155
01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:22.550
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2156
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:25.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different and um,</v>

2157
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:27.830
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it still gets back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the same elemental issues,</v>

2158
01:26:27.831 --> 01:26:28.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the.</v>

2159
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:30.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean how do you manage risk in your </v>

2160
01:26:31.041 --> 01:26:33.860
<v Speaker 1>life and what's worth it and how do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>choose it's,</v>

2161
01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:35.023
<v Speaker 1>it's a smart move to for company to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinda like very the kind of input that </v>

2162
01:26:39.051 --> 01:26:39.820
<v Speaker 1>gets to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2163
01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:40.653
<v Speaker 1>the employees like give them something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of spectacular and </v>

2164
01:26:43.521 --> 01:26:48.521
<v Speaker 1>interesting and you know really well now</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the future,</v>

2165
01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:53.480
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a map of what you would like</v>

2166
01:26:53.481 --> 01:26:54.490
<v Speaker 1>to be doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you,</v>

2167
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:57.570
<v Speaker 1>are you just sort of enjoying your </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience here or do,</v>

2168
01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:02.480
<v Speaker 1>do you have grand plans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really have grand plans.</v>

2169
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:04.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've never really had a grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>

2170
01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 1>It's always been that I love climbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to do it well.</v>

2171
01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I want to push myself and I think that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of my grand plan.</v>

2172
01:27:10.581 --> 01:27:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still trying to be a better climber.</v>

2173
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:14.303
<v Speaker 1>I'm still trying to grow the foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something more significant through </v>

2174
01:27:17.571 --> 01:27:19.460
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually hired a full time executive</v>

2175
01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:21.320
<v Speaker 1>director this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman who's running a me,</v>

2176
01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.760
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're actually sort of ramping it all</v>

2177
01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:24.613
<v Speaker 1>up a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was slightly in response to the </v>

2178
01:27:25.431 --> 01:27:27.800
<v Speaker 1>film because I sort of figured that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2179
01:27:27.801 --> 01:27:28.634
<v Speaker 1>this is like a moment that I should try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take advantage of and use it to do </v>

2180
01:27:30.741 --> 01:27:31.574
<v Speaker 1>something more positive and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's sort of exciting for me and </v>

2181
01:27:34.641 --> 01:27:36.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely not a grand plan,</v>

2182
01:27:36.951 --> 01:27:37.691
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2183
01:27:37.691 --> 01:27:40.220
<v Speaker 1>it's just sort of all incremental </v>
<v Speaker 1>incremental progress.</v>

2184
01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:45.070
<v Speaker 1>So when you're doing all these climbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of time when you're,</v>

2185
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:47.510
<v Speaker 1>it takes time to do these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So was this,</v>

2186
01:27:47.511 --> 01:27:51.440
<v Speaker 1>when you start thinking about these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about thinking about like how much</v>

2187
01:27:51.441 --> 01:27:52.274
<v Speaker 1>you enjoy being out here in nature and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm caring about the environment </v>

2188
01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:56.990
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2189
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.823
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

2190
01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I mean I spend most of my time in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most beautiful places on earth.</v>

2191
01:28:00.801 --> 01:28:01.634
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending most of my time in national </v>

2192
01:28:02.391 --> 01:28:06.830
<v Speaker 1>parks and public lands in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm in all these beautiful places</v>

2193
01:28:06.831 --> 01:28:07.341
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2194
01:28:07.341 --> 01:28:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I care about them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to,</v>

2195
01:28:09.090 --> 01:28:10.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I have a family someday,</v>

2196
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:13.160
<v Speaker 1>I want to be able to take my kids to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same places and have them appreciate the</v>

2197
01:28:13.161 --> 01:28:14.960
<v Speaker 1>land in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2198
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:16.423
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like you send of the last five years </v>

2199
01:28:17.541 --> 01:28:20.960
<v Speaker 1>for can the entire forest is basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>died from pine beetles,</v>

2200
01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:21.913
<v Speaker 1>will all the pine trees have basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>died because pine beetles and so like </v>

2201
01:28:24.261 --> 01:28:25.094
<v Speaker 1>just in the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say the Yosemite Valley floor has </v>

2202
01:28:28.131 --> 01:28:28.964
<v Speaker 1>sort of transformed from like a dense </v>
<v Speaker 1>pine forest to sort of this open oak </v>

2203
01:28:31.611 --> 01:28:32.444
<v Speaker 1>forest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like totally different character </v>

2204
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:34.633
<v Speaker 1>because all the pine trees have died and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they've been cutting them all down </v>

2205
01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:36.980
<v Speaker 1>to reduce fuel load.</v>

2206
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.260
<v Speaker 1>So they're basically logging trucks with</v>
<v Speaker 1>pine trees,</v>

2207
01:28:39.261 --> 01:28:42.110
<v Speaker 1>leaving the park nonstop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

2208
01:28:42.111 --> 01:28:43.510
<v Speaker 1>which I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I totally support.</v>

2209
01:28:43.511 --> 01:28:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not like anti logging the dead trees</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like you may as well use them if</v>

2210
01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:47.774
<v Speaker 1>they're already dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I definitely don't want to see so </v>

2211
01:28:49.251 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 1>many value all burst into flames.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it makes sense,</v>

2212
01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:52.820
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2213
01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:54.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real,</v>

2214
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:55.663
<v Speaker 1>that's a very direct result of climate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gender mean it's 10 years of drought in </v>

2215
01:28:57.531 --> 01:29:00.620
<v Speaker 1>California combined with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with shorter winters.</v>

2216
01:29:00.621 --> 01:29:04.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like just have these beetles </v>
<v Speaker 1>decimating the entire forest and I don't</v>

2217
01:29:04.771 --> 01:29:05.330
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

2218
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:06.163
<v Speaker 1>that sucks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2219
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:08.430
<v Speaker 1>like I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to see the whole forest die</v>

2220
01:29:08.431 --> 01:29:13.431
<v Speaker 1>and it's not an invasive beetle or is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beetle invasive invasive in that,</v>

2221
01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:14.923
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know specifically with you </v>

2222
01:29:15.751 --> 01:29:17.010
<v Speaker 1>seminar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be wrong about this,</v>

2223
01:29:17.011 --> 01:29:18.680
<v Speaker 1>but with a lot of the pine beetle </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems in,</v>

2224
01:29:18.681 --> 01:29:19.514
<v Speaker 1>in Colorado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has more to do with shorter winter </v>

2225
01:29:21.391 --> 01:29:26.391
<v Speaker 1>and warmer temperatures because normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larva would die through the winter.</v>

2226
01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:28.370
<v Speaker 1>They would freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2227
01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:30.690
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically they're not freezing in to the</v>

2228
01:29:30.691 --> 01:29:31.524
<v Speaker 1>same extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the population explodes and then </v>

2229
01:29:32.731 --> 01:29:35.040
<v Speaker 1>you wind up with all the trees dying </v>
<v Speaker 1>while we were there.</v>

2230
01:29:35.041 --> 01:29:35.874
<v Speaker 1>And we were in big bear a few years back</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were having a real issue with </v>

2231
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:42.660
<v Speaker 1>it and they were having real significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire scares young.</v>

2232
01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.730
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was nerve wracking.</v>

2233
01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:45.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

2234
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:47.400
<v Speaker 1>somebody who was like on fire for most </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the summer.</v>

2235
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:48.234
<v Speaker 1>It was this crazy for the whole southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the park was like burning for </v>

2236
01:29:50.251 --> 01:29:52.470
<v Speaker 1>months and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2237
01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:54.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean fire is a natural part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem and that,</v>

2238
01:29:54.810 --> 01:29:56.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some extent your life that's normal,</v>

2239
01:29:56.461 --> 01:29:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's like it's not normal right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the fuel load is so high.</v>

2240
01:29:59.341 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like so dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2241
01:30:00.901 --> 01:30:01.980
<v Speaker 1>it's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2242
01:30:02.370 --> 01:30:03.203
<v Speaker 1>and I just would love for my kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>someday to be able to appreciate the </v>

2243
01:30:05.641 --> 01:30:08.400
<v Speaker 1>park the way I have for so long and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>just don't want to see you don't burn.</v>

2244
01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:09.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was,</v>

2245
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:12.240
<v Speaker 1>when we were in big bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my feeling.</v>

2246
01:30:12.330 --> 01:30:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

2247
01:30:14.190 --> 01:30:17.760
<v Speaker 1>it was sad that you're seeing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was probably this rich green,</v>

2248
01:30:17.761 --> 01:30:21.710
<v Speaker 1>lush forest that's now really weird gray</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drive.</v>

2249
01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.240
<v Speaker 1>But it was also like you're around </v>
<v Speaker 1>kindling,</v>

2250
01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.133
<v Speaker 1>like you're basically in a big stack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dry wood before it gets lit on fire and </v>

2251
01:30:29.581 --> 01:30:32.040
<v Speaker 1>you're surrounded by it and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

2252
01:30:32.041 --> 01:30:33.900
<v Speaker 1>It hits up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2253
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:34.843
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been evacuated where I live </v>

2254
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 1>several times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twice,</v>

2255
01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:40.720
<v Speaker 1>actually come close a couple of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>times and it's,</v>

2256
01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.650
<v Speaker 1>it's terrifying because southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>California when it goes,</v>

2257
01:30:43.651 --> 01:30:46.900
<v Speaker 1>it goes and there's just no stopping it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2258
01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2259
01:30:47.790 --> 01:30:48.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

2260
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:50.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2261
01:30:50.521 --> 01:30:51.354
<v Speaker 1>this is why I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why we transitioned to solar </v>

2262
01:30:52.501 --> 01:30:53.130
<v Speaker 1>sooner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2263
01:30:53.130 --> 01:30:56.070
<v Speaker 1>because it's like if it helps at all </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these kinds of issues,</v>

2264
01:30:56.071 --> 01:30:56.904
<v Speaker 1>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth,</v>

2265
01:30:56.910 --> 01:30:58.230
<v Speaker 1>worth the effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2266
01:30:58.970 --> 01:30:59.910
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen anyway.</v>

2267
01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:01.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like you may as well just do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2268
01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:03.420
<v Speaker 1>so I just think that you were doing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Antarctica,</v>

2269
01:31:03.421 --> 01:31:06.570
<v Speaker 1>you're filming something there as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you do a lot of that now?</v>

2270
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm well for a trip like that for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expedition.</v>

2271
01:31:09.661 --> 01:31:10.494
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was the north face </v>
<v Speaker 1>expedition and so that's where they get </v>

2272
01:31:11.851 --> 01:31:16.620
<v Speaker 1>a lot of their brand content and so it </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense to film a trip like that and</v>

2273
01:31:16.621 --> 01:31:18.150
<v Speaker 1>we were somewhere where the nobody ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>

2274
01:31:18.151 --> 01:31:18.984
<v Speaker 1>We were doing first a sense of peaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up never been climbed so it kind </v>

2275
01:31:20.821 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 1>of makes sense to document that to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent.</v>

2276
01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:28.580
<v Speaker 1>But in general I think I try to balance </v>
<v Speaker 1>my just pure climbing with filming.</v>

2277
01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.340
<v Speaker 1>That's what I was going to ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to get,</v>

2278
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:32.203
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to film all the timing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's on your head every </v>

2279
01:31:35.231 --> 01:31:35.730
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

2280
01:31:35.730 --> 01:31:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Now that stuff drives me crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not into that.</v>

2281
01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:40.410
<v Speaker 1>But when you're in the most beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

2282
01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:43.470
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well where's something,</v>

2283
01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:44.453
<v Speaker 1>especially for someone like north face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean their whole company is about </v>

2284
01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.080
<v Speaker 1>really exploration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2285
01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

2286
01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:55.660
<v Speaker 1>when you are in that sort of situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're filming these things,</v>

2287
01:31:56.221 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 1>like is it difficult to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to act normal,</v>

2288
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:00.830
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2289
01:32:00.830 --> 01:32:03.730
<v Speaker 1>to be yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not refuse if you saw free solar,</v>

2290
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:04.564
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I only have one mode and that's </v>

2291
01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:06.610
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just me.</v>

2292
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I mean when,</v>

2293
01:32:08.830 --> 01:32:10.540
<v Speaker 1>when I see the film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them like,</v>

2294
01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.433
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I need to censor myself a little </v>

2295
01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:13.413
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe think there should be a </v>

2296
01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.810
<v Speaker 1>little more thoughtful about what I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2297
01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:18.280
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2298
01:32:18.281 --> 01:32:19.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm pretty much always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2299
01:32:19.781 --> 01:32:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I just do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me and the people are filming or not.</v>

2300
01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.200
<v Speaker 1>They just get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2301
01:32:23.201 --> 01:32:25.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm more mindful of profanity and a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

2302
01:32:25.481 --> 01:32:26.770
<v Speaker 1>If I know that I'm being filmed right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

2303
01:32:26.771 --> 01:32:27.604
<v Speaker 1>I'm being watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I try to be slightly more </v>

2304
01:32:29.441 --> 01:32:30.274
<v Speaker 1>respectful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if I see kids in an audience </v>

2305
01:32:31.481 --> 01:32:33.790
<v Speaker 1>that definitely try not to curse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

2306
01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:34.901
<v Speaker 1>but overall I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2307
01:32:34.901 --> 01:32:36.610
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just always stay in my mind,</v>

2308
01:32:36.611 --> 01:32:37.351
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2309
01:32:37.351 --> 01:32:40.840
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was talking about earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was asking the difference between</v>

2310
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:45.820
<v Speaker 1>you when you're being your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your love of this is your love of nature</v>

2311
01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:46.893
<v Speaker 1>and of being in these beautiful national</v>
<v Speaker 1>forests and public lands and </v>

2312
01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:50.764
<v Speaker 1>experiencing these amazing environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then sometimes that gets sort of </v>

2313
01:32:55.660 --> 01:32:59.620
<v Speaker 1>perverted when you filming everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got people just.</v>

2314
01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:00.693
<v Speaker 1>Everything becomes this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>presentation and everything becomes </v>

2315
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:05.733
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I think that's the risk with </v>

2316
01:33:08.351 --> 01:33:08.680
<v Speaker 1>filming.</v>

2317
01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I think with Free Solo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they did an amazing job of,</v>

2318
01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:15.030
<v Speaker 1>of maintaining the character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2319
01:33:15.100 --> 01:33:17.320
<v Speaker 1>the nuance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not perverting it in any way.</v>

2320
01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:18.251
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so too.</v>

2321
01:33:18.251 --> 01:33:19.570
<v Speaker 1>I think it was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2322
01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:20.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2323
01:33:20.051 --> 01:33:20.884
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they did a really good job of </v>

2324
01:33:21.641 --> 01:33:22.330
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2325
01:33:22.330 --> 01:33:24.160
<v Speaker 1>and it's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still sort of understated,</v>

2326
01:33:24.161 --> 01:33:24.994
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's like this spectacular </v>

2327
01:33:25.751 --> 01:33:26.584
<v Speaker 1>feat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still sort of subdued and its own </v>

2328
01:33:27.431 --> 01:33:28.264
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just sort of lays it out </v>

2329
01:33:28.991 --> 01:33:29.824
<v Speaker 1>beautifully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's you just sort of judge for </v>

2330
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:31.690
<v Speaker 1>yourself and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2331
01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:32.583
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible to be anything but </v>

2332
01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.770
<v Speaker 1>spectacular so you don't really have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dress it up.</v>

2333
01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2334
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:38.143
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's the beauty of filming </v>

2335
01:33:38.861 --> 01:33:40.460
<v Speaker 1>anything in Yosemite is that it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

2336
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:41.383
<v Speaker 1>it's honestly just one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful places on earth would be like </v>

2337
01:33:42.911 --> 01:33:46.630
<v Speaker 1>putting a pretty dress on a Ferrari or </v>
<v Speaker 1>like leave it alone.</v>

2338
01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:49.630
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've already got it.</v>

2339
01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:54.960
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever thought about doing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>like live journal from the field or some</v>

2340
01:33:55.511 --> 01:33:58.090
<v Speaker 1>sort of a podcast or something along </v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines?</v>

2341
01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2342
01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I.</v>

2343
01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:02.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds,</v>

2344
01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:06.250
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A podcast would be easy.</v>

2345
01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:07.533
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to be able to interview </v>

2346
01:34:08.291 --> 01:34:09.390
<v Speaker 1>people proper way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2347
01:34:09.391 --> 01:34:10.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2348
01:34:10.170 --> 01:34:11.003
<v Speaker 1>you don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend bill burr has a podcast where </v>

2349
01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:16.700
<v Speaker 1>he just talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does a fucking great,</v>

2350
01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.540
<v Speaker 1>but he's a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2351
01:34:18.541 --> 01:34:18.900
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2352
01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:22.690
<v Speaker 1>With Monday morning podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just sitting down.</v>

2353
01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:25.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could go off notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could go off of and just.</v>

2354
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:29.620
<v Speaker 1>I think people would love that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just never thought about it.</v>

2355
01:34:29.621 --> 01:34:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean in some ways I do have strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions about a lot of things,</v>

2356
01:34:31.931 --> 01:34:32.764
<v Speaker 1>like if I just ranted about </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental issues and similar things </v>

2357
01:34:34.961 --> 01:34:36.910
<v Speaker 1>that I care about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually would be kind of fun,</v>

2358
01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:38.073
<v Speaker 1>but you'd have a significant impact to </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially have such a large platform </v>

2359
01:34:41.231 --> 01:34:42.510
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>

2360
01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll consider it.</v>

2361
01:34:44.471 --> 01:34:45.850
<v Speaker 1>That's the first time that anyone's ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned.</v>

2362
01:34:45.851 --> 01:34:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could think about that.</v>

2363
01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:50.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm notorious for trying to talk people </v>
<v Speaker 1>into podcast,</v>

2364
01:34:50.290 --> 01:34:52.840
<v Speaker 1>but I really think in your case you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great idea.</v>

2365
01:34:53.170 --> 01:34:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really feel like.</v>

2366
01:34:54.311 --> 01:34:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I tell everyone to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you should really do it well.</v>

2367
01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 1>People get mad</v>

2368
01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.420
<v Speaker 2>at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You keep telling people to do it,</v>

2369
01:34:59.421 --> 01:35:03.320
<v Speaker 2>but I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a portable unit,</v>

2370
01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:07.370
<v Speaker 2>like a fricking players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something you can just record a phone.</v>

2371
01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2372
01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:10.100
<v Speaker 2>A recording on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very easy.</v>

2373
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:11.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>

2374
01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:15.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've done a bunch of them were </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the voice notes from the phone just</v>

2375
01:35:15.981 --> 01:35:16.814
<v Speaker 2>talking to the voice notes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone and you can make a podcast off </v>

2376
01:35:18.831 --> 01:35:21.660
<v Speaker 2>that and it's really easy to upload.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But just saving.</v>

2377
01:35:21.710 --> 01:35:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's my future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sitting in your van,</v>

2378
01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and just talking about things</v>

2379
01:35:27.741 --> 01:35:32.741
<v Speaker 2>you're working on with your foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about spectacular moments during</v>

2380
01:35:32.901 --> 01:35:36.190
<v Speaker 2>climbs where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing things and you know,</v>

2381
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:40.130
<v Speaker 2>talking about what it's been like doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this tour for free.</v>

2382
01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:41.553
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2383
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:42.430
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>

2384
01:35:42.510 --> 01:35:43.640
<v Speaker 3>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll think about it.</v>

2385
01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand where to put it out there.</v>

2386
01:35:46.660 --> 01:35:47.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a great idea,</v>

2387
01:35:47.891 --> 01:35:48.800
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

2388
01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:50.053
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You consider to get it out or send me a </v>

2389
01:35:53.471 --> 01:35:54.430
<v Speaker 3>little MP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Three recorder.</v>

2390
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:58.630
<v Speaker 3>We can definitely do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we could also help you like pro.</v>

2391
01:35:58.810 --> 01:36:00.940
<v Speaker 3>I can promote it for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put it on twitter,</v>

2392
01:36:00.941 --> 01:36:02.620
<v Speaker 3>let people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see if uh,</v>

2393
01:36:02.621 --> 01:36:04.000
<v Speaker 3>if I ever actually do anything like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2394
01:36:04.570 --> 01:36:05.141
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

2395
01:36:05.141 --> 01:36:05.974
<v Speaker 3>it's an interesting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's an interesting way to like </v>

2396
01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:08.620
<v Speaker 3>share,</v>
<v Speaker 3>share ideas better.</v>

2397
01:36:09.010 --> 01:36:09.840
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2398
01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:14.130
<v Speaker 2>well the reason why I'm saying this just</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you have this very specific,</v>

2399
01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:16.043
<v Speaker 2>very unusual life and you also have all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas about the environment and </v>

2400
01:36:21.511 --> 01:36:26.511
<v Speaker 2>have all these ideas about using it for </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive reasons and altruistic,</v>

2401
01:36:27.930 --> 01:36:30.330
<v Speaker 2>hoping to freaking make the world a </v>
<v Speaker 2>better place and having,</v>

2402
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:31.223
<v Speaker 2>making an impact with your foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think it could look the best </v>

2403
01:36:35.311 --> 01:36:37.850
<v Speaker 2>thing with your foundation would be to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make,</v>

2404
01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:41.700
<v Speaker 2>make it expose to more people and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would most certainly do that.</v>

2405
01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:42.673
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2406
01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.530
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk to my executive director about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that too.</v>

2407
01:36:45.531 --> 01:36:46.364
<v Speaker 3>I mean that would be an interesting way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to at least share the ideas that I care </v>

2408
01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:50.360
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2409
01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.400
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea of just sitting in a recording,</v>

2410
01:36:52.401 --> 01:36:53.234
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>

2411
01:36:53.570 --> 01:36:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Kinda cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2412
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:55.783
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you at the base of a mountain just </v>

2413
01:36:57.771 --> 01:37:01.620
<v Speaker 2>talking about this and climbing and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal thoughts in that</v>

2414
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:05.290
<v Speaker 3>could be Douchey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it'd have to be well done.</v>

2415
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:07.150
<v Speaker 3>You'd have to be a Douche bag for it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>be douchey.</v>

2416
01:37:07.210 --> 01:37:09.640
<v Speaker 3>Well that's the danger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the danger.</v>

2417
01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:10.900
<v Speaker 3>You just never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2418
01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.700
<v Speaker 3>nobody thinks that they're the Douche,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2419
01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:16.000
<v Speaker 3>you think you'd become a Douche or you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just never know.</v>

2420
01:37:16.001 --> 01:37:16.834
<v Speaker 3>You never know when you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just gonna record monologues of me </v>

2421
01:37:18.821 --> 01:37:19.654
<v Speaker 3>rambling about ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's when you start to trend towards </v>

2422
01:37:22.301 --> 01:37:23.580
<v Speaker 3>do sheena's perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2423
01:37:23.770 --> 01:37:24.603
<v Speaker 3>it's a slippery slope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could always review it or have your </v>

2424
01:37:26.681 --> 01:37:28.000
<v Speaker 3>girlfriend review it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2425
01:37:28.001 --> 01:37:28.650
<v Speaker 3>that's.</v>

2426
01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:30.740
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do it live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just,</v>

2427
01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:31.800
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then she could say,</v>

2428
01:37:31.801 --> 01:37:32.634
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that part we use rant and rave about </v>

2429
01:37:34.321 --> 01:37:35.220
<v Speaker 2>diesel might want to.</v>

2430
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:39.040
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean why or maybe not.</v>

2431
01:37:39.130 --> 01:37:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2432
01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:41.830
<v Speaker 3>I feel strongly about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll rant and rave about diesel forever.</v>

2433
01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:44.520
<v Speaker 3>That's just not bros.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah man.</v>

2434
01:37:44.590 --> 01:37:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Imagine when electric trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2435
01:37:46.230 --> 01:37:50.770
<v Speaker 3>like long haul trucking or mike.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh well tesla's already on there.</v>

2436
01:37:50.771 --> 01:37:51.830
<v Speaker 3>On the ball with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2437
01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:52.673
<v Speaker 3>We'll hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of don't care who comes market </v>

2438
01:37:55.471 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 3>first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>

2439
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:58.320
<v Speaker 2>I just want somebody to start selling a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of them.</v>

2440
01:37:58.321 --> 01:37:59.154
<v Speaker 2>She was lIke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted the change to happen </v>

2441
01:37:59.971 --> 01:38:01.530
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter who does it or how.</v>

2442
01:38:01.531 --> 01:38:02.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just needs to happen.</v>

2443
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:05.310
<v Speaker 2>You've got a very significant voice </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

2444
01:38:05.780 --> 01:38:08.640
<v Speaker 2>I really think that you could make a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>impact with a lot of people.</v>

2445
01:38:08.641 --> 01:38:11.640
<v Speaker 2>And the thing about these impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sorta like the butterfly effect,</v>

2446
01:38:11.641 --> 01:38:12.474
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you never know what it </v>

2447
01:38:13.231 --> 01:38:14.064
<v Speaker 2>actually changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with how many people are going </v>

2448
01:38:15.431 --> 01:38:18.930
<v Speaker 2>to hear you just from this podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things you're saying about solar and</v>

2449
01:38:18.931 --> 01:38:21.300
<v Speaker 2>about and people thinking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2450
01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:24.000
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I can do something and then boom,</v>

2451
01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:24.953
<v Speaker 2>it just makes these little incremental </v>
<v Speaker 2>steps and then they carry on momentum </v>

2452
01:38:30.061 --> 01:38:32.910
<v Speaker 2>and you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the,</v>

2453
01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.890
<v Speaker 2>that's the positive way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2454
01:38:34.891 --> 01:38:39.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool to like notes from wherever you are</v>

2455
01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:40.800
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>

2456
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean he doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to have.</v>

2457
01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:43.163
<v Speaker 2>The beautiful thing is too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to have any kind of </v>

2458
01:38:44.341 --> 01:38:46.170
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have any time.</v>

2459
01:38:46.171 --> 01:38:49.410
<v Speaker 2>You can do one for 15 minutes if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>want and people will listen to it.</v>

2460
01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:50.483
<v Speaker 2>You could do it for an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that that might be a little micro </v>

2461
01:38:52.561 --> 01:38:56.370
<v Speaker 2>hits like little rambles for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do it as long as you want,</v>

2462
01:38:56.371 --> 01:38:58.080
<v Speaker 2>and it looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

2463
01:38:58.081 --> 01:39:01.080
<v Speaker 2>the beautiful thing about things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is that there's no.</v>

2464
01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:05.760
<v Speaker 2>There's no real structure to it where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to do something totally.</v>

2465
01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just decide in a lot of ways,</v>

2466
01:39:09.090 --> 01:39:11.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the nature of climbing to where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you never have to do anything.</v>

2467
01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:14.010
<v Speaker 2>You just find what inspires you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You work towards it,</v>

2468
01:39:14.011 --> 01:39:14.844
<v Speaker 2>you do it when you're excited about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally into that kind of thing </v>

2469
01:39:17.131 --> 01:39:18.710
<v Speaker 2>because it's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

2470
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.553
<v Speaker 2>I've always cry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contrast to cliMbing from other </v>

2471
01:39:20.851 --> 01:39:22.620
<v Speaker 2>mainstream sports like that because with</v>
<v Speaker 2>climbing,</v>

2472
01:39:22.621 --> 01:39:25.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like the objective is always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>YOu're always inspired by it.</v>

2473
01:39:25.041 --> 01:39:25.874
<v Speaker 2>You do it whenever you're ready as </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposed to having to perform on the </v>

2474
01:39:28.111 --> 01:39:29.890
<v Speaker 2>right day at the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2475
01:39:29.891 --> 01:39:31.470
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that lifesTyle where you're like,</v>

2476

2477

2478
01:39:37.561 --> 01:39:38.394

<v Speaker 2>If there was sort of a documented audio </v>

2479
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:48.591
<v Speaker 2>journal while I watch the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

2480
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.270
<v Speaker 2>you're just wetting their appetite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a beautiful film.</v>

2481
01:39:51.271 --> 01:39:52.104
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's people like to see more and </v>

2482
01:39:54.740 --> 01:39:55.573
<v Speaker 2>more stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting and it's entirely up to you </v>

2483
01:39:58.501 --> 01:40:00.140
<v Speaker 2>what you want to share.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't want to share it.</v>

2484
01:40:00.141 --> 01:40:03.660
<v Speaker 2>Especially if yOu do it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have an executive producer,</v>

2485
01:40:03.661 --> 01:40:04.660
<v Speaker 2>you don't have directors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2486
01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:05.430
<v Speaker 2>totally would.</v>

2487
01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:07.470
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely couldn't handle too much.</v>

2488
01:40:07.471 --> 01:40:08.304
<v Speaker 2>Just you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just talking about stuff and your </v>

2489
01:40:11.341 --> 01:40:14.310
<v Speaker 2>specific vision of the things that you'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to talk about and your,</v>

2490
01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.820
<v Speaker 2>your specific message because that's one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the things that people really,</v>

2491
01:40:17.821 --> 01:40:22.320
<v Speaker 2>really enjoy about something like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast is that they know there's no one</v>

2492
01:40:22.350 --> 01:40:24.930
<v Speaker 2>telling you what to say or what to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2493
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:26.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>following your heart,</v>

2494
01:40:26.850 --> 01:40:28.620
<v Speaker 2>sitting in his van,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2495
01:40:28.650 --> 01:40:32.310
<v Speaker 2>drinking a cup of tea just with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>iphone talking.</v>

2496
01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:35.160
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to imagine people would find </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2497
01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Understand what I'm telling You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Oh no.</v>

2501

<v Speaker 2>I appreciate that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm slightly worried I'm going to </v>

2502
01:40:47.521 --> 01:40:48.870
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to miss my plane.</v>

2503
01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:49.441
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2508
01:40:56.581 --> 01:40:57.414
<v Speaker 3>It's fun to chat again because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>remember last time I was on the show </v>

2509
01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.310
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a full experience for him.</v>

2510
01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.400
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the first time that I'd done</v>
<v Speaker 3>anything like that and it was like,</v>

2511
01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.790
<v Speaker 3>It was pretty mega.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2512
01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:05.380
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what I'm doing.</v>

2513
01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:06.214
<v Speaker 3>This is so much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like now I feel so much more </v>

2514
01:41:07.211 --> 01:41:09.790
<v Speaker 3>comfortable and fun to chat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>

2515
01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:10.624
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really great to see what I'm </v>

2516
01:41:11.051 --> 01:41:12.820
