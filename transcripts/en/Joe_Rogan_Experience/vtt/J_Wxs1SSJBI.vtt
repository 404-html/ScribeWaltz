00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.290
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get so well,</v>

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>how did you get the Alex Jones wanted to be nine 11 nine one one I had a plan it</v>

4
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.350
<v Speaker 1>out so I had to,</v>

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.171
<v Speaker 1>we had to do,</v>

6
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I had a fit some podcasts in,</v>

7
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I had to do like extra ones the week before just so I could get to number nine</v>

8
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>11 with Alex,</v>

9
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

10
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>wasn't it?</v>

11
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a long,</v>

12
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>see pat him on earlier and I would have definitely had them on again for nine 11</v>

13
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>but having one the first time for nine 11 and to this day,</v>

14
00:00:26.581 --> 00:00:31.581
<v Speaker 1>that's our biggest podcasts by really by maybe 5 million downloads.</v>

15
00:00:33.031 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>Fuck yeah,</v>

16
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>but here's the conspiracy,</v>

17
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:35.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:35.701
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

19
00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Am I saying correctly?</v>

20
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>What is the actual number?</v>

21
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Probably 16 now.</v>

22
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>I didn't check in the last two or three days,</v>

23
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:42.781
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>

24
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>so it's 16 million dot.</v>

25
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.263
<v Speaker 1>Here's what's crazy.</v>

26
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>It never charted on iTunes.</v>

27
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>The iTunes charts magically went down while the Alex Jones podcast was in the</v>

28
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>queue and they stayed down for over a week.</v>

29
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:59.991
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy theory and then when it came back up podcasts that got way less</v>

30
00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>downloads than Alex's.</v>

31
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>We're re we're rated much higher than his and they had happened before and</v>

32
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.140
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

33
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I do remember kids was the only podcast that was left out of the ratings loop,</v>

34
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>like for sure it would have been the number one podcast in the country.</v>

35
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>It was the number one podcast we did by a mile and I've had the number one</v>

36
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>podcast before.</v>

37
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like the number one podcast episode that was more than 5 million downloads</v>

38
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>more than any other podcasts I had before.</v>

39
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>So it's should for sure probably would have been number one if it wasn't a lot</v>

40
00:01:28.591 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>of downloads unless they had like one of those serial episodes or something that</v>

41
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.334
<v Speaker 1>came out that week.</v>

42
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.823
<v Speaker 1>So there you go.</v>

43
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

44
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely that someone's trying to hold Alex Jones back and that's just</v>

45
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>stokes his fucking fight.</v>

46
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand this.</v>

47
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>The Streisand effect can stoke the fire of Alex Jones.</v>

48
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Even Megan Kelly's fuck now her show's going down the toilet.</v>

49
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>It can happen in the aftermath.</v>

50
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

51
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.621
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

52
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem is a problem.</v>

53
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>Megan Kelly was a Fox News person.</v>

54
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>She left Fox News to go to NBC.</v>

55
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>NBC is thought of as CNBC,</v>

56
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>which is thought of as fake news by these right wing Trump.</v>

57
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Trump bands,</v>

58
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>what would you call him?</v>

59
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Trump Trumpers.</v>

60
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as she goes over there,</v>

61
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to listen to her.</v>

62
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>And then to the liberals,</v>

63
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.530
<v Speaker 1>she's Fox News,</v>

64
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>So they're not interested in either.</v>

66
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>And then she does this podcast with Alex Jones or this interview rather with</v>

67
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Alex Jones and the interview with Alex Jones.</v>

68
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

69
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to paint you out as a monster.</v>

70
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.431
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you a fair,</v>

71
00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>like she's saying all these things,</v>

72
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>like she's going to throw softballs as way.</v>

73
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>I want people to get to know you.</v>

74
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>And he releases all that and he's like,</v>

75
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:34.771
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

76
00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:35.581
<v Speaker 1>this is that person.</v>

77
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>And then the ratings just keep cutting,</v>

78
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.251
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:38.490
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

80
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.710
<v Speaker 1>but famous but not like Tom Cruise fairness.</v>

81
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

82
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.901
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise,</v>

83
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>like connected with that person.</v>

84
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

85
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.660
<v Speaker 1>it would make it a better story if I hadn't remembered who it was.</v>

86
00:02:46.661 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>But it was somebody like that,</v>

87
00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>like your level or like or,</v>

88
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>or like a mark Duplass or you know what I'm saying?</v>

89
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't know who mark the plaza's.</v>

90
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Well he's the guy at your level.</v>

91
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.213
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

92
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

93
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.211
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

94
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>I know he is the duplos.</v>

95
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>She knows who everybody is.</v>

96
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:01.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who the deposit there,</v>

97
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.703
<v Speaker 1>ed there,</v>

98
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>they're made the show togetherness on Hbo.</v>

99
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>My point isn't about the Duplass brothers is like,</v>

100
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>they were just like semi famous,</v>

101
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:09.544
<v Speaker 1>not like</v>

102
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Tom Cruise cruise.</v>

103
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.411
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

104
00:03:12.411 --> 00:03:13.244
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

105
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>so horny,</v>

106
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:15.360
<v Speaker 1>she wants to get to the fight.</v>

107
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>So you see he got invited to a Superbowl party at this person's house.</v>

108
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

109
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I could imagine if Tom Cruise is coming to your house for the Super Super Bowl</v>

110
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:24.431
<v Speaker 1>super bowl party,</v>

111
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

112
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>oh whoa asking Tom Cruise.</v>

113
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>And he says yes.</v>

114
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.651
<v Speaker 1>I like honey,</v>

115
00:03:28.651 --> 00:03:29.351
<v Speaker 1>you said yes.</v>

116
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.184
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>

117
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.671
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

118
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>And the Mediterranean Tom Cruise be like,</v>

119
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I think I will be among the humans today.</v>

120
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.291
<v Speaker 1>So Tom Cruise,</v>

121
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.180
<v Speaker 1>it barely shows up with a brand new,</v>

122
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>like clearly fresh football,</v>

123
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>but his assistant like you know,</v>

124
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>he's like tossing like a literal brand new football in the air.</v>

125
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

126
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>And they're all talking about marriage at some point in the day and goes,</v>

127
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>do you know what the best part of being married is though?</v>

128
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

129
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.550

131
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.870
<v Speaker 1>You just fuck your wife and everybody's like felt like tumbleweeds are all the</v>

132
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>parts sort of like a robot,</v>

133
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.080
<v Speaker 1>like an alien visiting us.</v>

134
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 1>He must be amazing to hang out with.</v>

136
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>I would love to hang out with him.</v>

137
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Fucking your wife.</v>

138
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:06.574
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

139
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you're that famous,</v>

140
00:04:09.141 --> 00:04:10.190
<v Speaker 2>your work ethic,</v>

141
00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:14.360
<v Speaker 2>it's like you just devote everything to that I think because like I have my,</v>

142
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.380
<v Speaker 2>my agents were like,</v>

143
00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:17.700
<v Speaker 2>they know that the agents who are Tom Cruise,</v>

144
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:18.051
<v Speaker 2>they didn't,</v>

145
00:04:18.051 --> 00:04:21.170
<v Speaker 2>they said Tom Cruise always gets back within an hour when we send a script,</v>

146
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.560
<v Speaker 2>cause I like keep a script for like three weeks and then by the time I read it,</v>

147
00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:25.670
<v Speaker 2>the parts being gassed.</v>

148
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.160
<v Speaker 2>Is it Tom Cruise?</v>

149
00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:31.400
<v Speaker 2>We'll read a script and an hour and get back to them and either like it or not</v>

150
00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:31.970
<v Speaker 2>like it.</v>

151
00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Like he's just like on the ball.</v>

152
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:34.311
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>

153
00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:34.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

154
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.420
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

155
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.440
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to win.</v>

156
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.630
<v Speaker 2>He's won and it's an inhuman instinct because our human instinct is to just</v>

157
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 2>atrophy in a way.</v>

158
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to kind of fight it,</v>

159
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.690
<v Speaker 2>but easy to be lazy.</v>

160
00:04:47.691 --> 00:04:48.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm to procrastinate.</v>

161
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely easy to be lazy,</v>

162
00:04:49.981 --> 00:04:50.641
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

163
00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:53.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be Tom cruise really have to be on the ball.</v>

164
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.030
<v Speaker 1>There's no other way.</v>

165
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just time job.</v>

166
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 1>That's not just what's going on and was just some weird alien sort of behavior</v>

167
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 1>patterns that we don't recognize as being normal.</v>

168
00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Like when he jumped up on Oprah's couch,</v>

169
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.611
<v Speaker 1>it's like I'm in love,</v>

170
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:06.091
<v Speaker 1>I'm in love,</v>

171
00:05:06.091 --> 00:05:06.541
<v Speaker 1>I'm in love,</v>

172
00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:07.200
<v Speaker 1>and it was like,</v>

173
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.730
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is going on here?</v>

174
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

175
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's a person.</v>

176
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.231
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

177
00:05:10.231 --> 00:05:12.540
<v Speaker 1>it's like a person who doesn't understand French,</v>

178
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.890
<v Speaker 1>but you're speaking French to a French person who saying all the right words,</v>

179
00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Speaker 1>like what the fuck is wrong?</v>

180
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.830
<v Speaker 1>It seems like every choice he makes outside of acting is based on what he's</v>

181
00:05:22.831 --> 00:05:25.860
<v Speaker 1>assuming normal human beings think is the normal behavior.</v>

182
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

183
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.490
<v Speaker 1>So it goes,</v>

184
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.701
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

185
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.320
<v Speaker 1>love is when you jump on a couch or go,</v>

186
00:05:28.321 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I love her,</v>

187
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:31.680
<v Speaker 1>which is informed by movies really.</v>

188
00:05:31.681 --> 00:05:32.011
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

189
00:05:32.011 --> 00:05:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Like that's more movie like,</v>

190
00:05:33.571 --> 00:05:33.781
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

191
00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:35.910
<v Speaker 1>That's like John Cusak and say anything like,</v>

192
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.151
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

193
00:05:36.151 --> 00:05:37.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what love looks like.</v>

194
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:37.974
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

195
00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

196
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 1>or telling a bunch of the fellows in Oregon to have sex talk with the fellows.</v>

197
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

198
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a wild look to fuck my wife.</v>

199
00:05:44.421 --> 00:05:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

200
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 1>The friction of her vagina makes me just sploosh how right guys?</v>

201
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.793
<v Speaker 1>And everyone's like</v>

202
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.980
<v Speaker 2>everyone like,</v>

203
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:50.221
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

204
00:05:50.221 --> 00:05:51.054
<v Speaker 2>we're sick of fucking,</v>

205
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.450
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when people were wearing those,</v>

206
00:05:53.451 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 1>a holograms attached to a rubber band around their wrist?</v>

207
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.441
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

208
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

209
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>do you remember these stupid fucking things?</v>

210
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.051
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember him?</v>

211
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

212
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:01.050
<v Speaker 1>You remember?</v>

213
00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

214
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>I think Gwyneth Paltrow has got in trouble for selling them on her.</v>

215
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:04.721
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

216
00:06:04.721 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

217
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.880
<v Speaker 1>damn fucking bitch.</v>

218
00:06:06.881 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

219
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.323
<v Speaker 1>No offense.</v>

220
00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>But I might've,</v>

221
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I might've said some mean things about,</v>

222
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>it's been a couple of things about her lately and her fucking nutty website.</v>

223
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.200
<v Speaker 1>She takes,</v>

224
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.360
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

225
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to wear like a rock inside your vagina.</v>

226
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that one of those things?</v>

227
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 1>I call them pussy rocks.</v>

228
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Pussy rocks are hilarious.</v>

230
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>I guess it would be like strengthen you</v>

231
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>if you want to strengthen it.</v>

232
00:06:28.791 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>Just two key goals around a dick.</v>

233
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 1>That's my,</v>

234
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 1>that's my method.</v>

235
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Works out.</v>

236
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if it can't be a dick or a rocks.</v>

237
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:36.403
<v Speaker 1>Good way to go.</v>

238
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Gwyneth Paltrow wants to heal you with magic stickers.</v>

239
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:39.734
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

240
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.210
<v Speaker 1>She needs getting paid though.</v>

241
00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:42.831
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you that.</v>

242
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of dummies out there that are sought momming all the way to the</v>

243
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>ATM machine.</v>

244
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>She is proof that bullshit sells way better than science.</v>

245
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

246
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>I do not have her,</v>

247
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:52.394
<v Speaker 1>her salary.</v>

248
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh wait a minute.</v>

249
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>You can rebalance the energy frequency.</v>

250
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:55.753
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

251
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second.</v>

252
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.450
<v Speaker 1>She's discovered something about stickers.</v>

253
00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

254
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>If you take these stickers,</v>

255
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>if they're made with the right material,</v>

256
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you just stick them on your body in the right places.</v>

257
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:10.331
<v Speaker 1>And they in quotes rebalance the energy frequency in our bodies are made out of</v>

258
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>a NASA space suit material.</v>

259
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.490
<v Speaker 1>And NASA said it was a load of bs,</v>

260
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second.</v>

261
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that NASA is right.</v>

262
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.943
<v Speaker 1>Bunch of movies.</v>

263
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Hold on cause he'll just stop.</v>

264
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.331
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

265
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

266
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 1>School science says Gwyneth Paltrow's goop website,</v>

267
00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.060
<v Speaker 1>a lifestyle business lifestyle which sells all things with advertise.</v>

268
00:07:32.061 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>These stickers are using NASA space suit material,</v>

269
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:38.750
<v Speaker 1>which presumably was the source of their magic healing properties.</v>

270
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

271
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.970
<v Speaker 1>She's special stickers and not made.</v>

272
00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.380
<v Speaker 1>This is what NASA says.</v>

273
00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 1>They're not made of space suit material,</v>

274
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.571
<v Speaker 1>not that space.</v>

275
00:07:48.571 --> 00:07:49.490
<v Speaker 1>New suit material.</v>

276
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>It has healing properties.</v>

277
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.410
<v Speaker 1>The first place it doesn't,</v>

278
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>but the quote from the foreign NASA scientist,</v>

279
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:58.661
<v Speaker 1>Mark Shel Shel Ham Shell Shell Hummer Shelmar Shelmar sums it up.</v>

280
00:07:58.810 --> 00:07:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

281
00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.661
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

282
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

283
00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.350
<v Speaker 1>what a load of bs this is or that.</v>

284
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

285
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

286
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>She's obviously goop,</v>

287
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.320
<v Speaker 1>quickly updated its site.</v>

288
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.561
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

289
00:08:06.561 --> 00:08:09.620
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't claim anything about NASA space suits and stickers,</v>

290
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.500
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't dial back end in the magical healing claims.</v>

291
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Here's what coops has now in an article called wearable stickers that promote</v>

292
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>healing in parentheses.</v>

293
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:19.303
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

294
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:24.550
<v Speaker 1>you fuck human bodies operate at an ideal energetic frequency,</v>

295
00:08:26.061 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>but everyday stresses and anxiety.</v>

296
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:29.240
<v Speaker 1>You're giving me stress.</v>

297
00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:29.900
<v Speaker 1>You Bitch,</v>

298
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.970
<v Speaker 1>you can throw off our internal balance,</v>

299
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>depleting our energy reserves and weakening our immune system.</v>

300
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:38.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking imagine thinking that you could put a sticker on you and it's going</v>

301
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:39.320
<v Speaker 1>to heal you.</v>

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Body vibe stickers.</v>

303

00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 1>They're called body vibes coming pre pre-pro.</v>

305
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>They come preprogrammed.</v>

306
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck the programming.</v>

307
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.890
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that to an ideal frequency,</v>

308
00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 1>allowing them to target imbalances.</v>

309
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.880
<v Speaker 1>You motherfucker,</v>

310

<v Speaker 1>the residuals on the iron man movies just weren't enough for her.</v>

315
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.211
<v Speaker 1>God Damn.</v>

316
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>60 bucks for a 10 pound.</v>

317
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:05.923
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>
