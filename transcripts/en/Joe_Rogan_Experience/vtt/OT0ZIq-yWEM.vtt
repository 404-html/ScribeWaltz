1
00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.630
All right,
here we go.
Five,
four,
three,

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.700
two,

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.380
<v 1>one.
Yes.
How are you man?
What's going on?
Gel?
I'm stuck,
man.
I'm really good.</v>

4
00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:15.740
Really glad to be here.
I'm stoked too.
Yeah.
Nice to meet you,
dude.

5
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:20.320
You're on naked and afraid Cheryl.
Cheryl was,
dude,
it's so,

6
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.800
it's so ridiculous.

7
00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:24.460
Like to say ridiculous is such an understatement because he's,

8
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:25.400
because they oftentimes,
yeah,

9
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.640
<v 0>we'll have like an actual survival expert or a wildlife expert or someone who</v>

10
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.020
knows how to live in the woods.
Sure.

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.990
And is that was the idea with you get a wildlife expert?

12
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.110
<v 1>Definitely.
I mean I'm,
I'm kind of a combo.
Like I,</v>

13
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.280
I've practiced primitive survival for many years in a means to get closer to

14
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:41.760
wildlife.

15
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.170
Like I just got back from the Amazon and we had to feed ourselves everyday.

16
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.330
We had to build shelter,
Blah Blah.
And I don't do it like for fun,

17
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:51.600
I do it as a means to be out further and stay longer kind of thing.

18
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.960
<v 0>But it's gotta be a little bit of a conscious effort,
right?
Like to have fun,</v>

19
00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.550
like fishing for your food shirt and you know,
putting up shelter,

20
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.740
I mean it's gotta be like kind of cool to live like that for a little bit.

21
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.220
<v 1>It's a,
it's human nature.
You know,
like we,</v>

22
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:10.210
we intrinsically want to hunt things and fish things and build a shelter and

23
00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:13.360
survive.
And so it's totally fine.
I think it's like,
to your core,
it's fun,

24
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.620
you know what I mean?
You just feel it.
Like,

25
00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:18.100
you know that you're doing something that's like primal human nature.
Yeah.

26
00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:22.480
The Amazon fishing clips that you have on your Instagram page,
it's crazy.

27
00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:25.240
Like you just throw a cast out there and you were catching a big fish,

28
00:01:25.241 --> 00:01:28.120
like instantly bonkers.
Like I fished a lot of places.

29
00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:32.380
I'm really into fishing and spear fishing and every Joe,
I'm not kidding,

30
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.460
every single cost was a fish,
a peacock bass or a pronto.
Every cost.

31
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.880
And where we were in the Amazon super remote,
like not a lot of people go there.

32
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:44.320
I'm sure those fish have never,
ever seen a lure.
Never seen a hook before.
And uh,

33
00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.580
it wasn't like sport fishing.
It was like,
okay,
let's go catch 10 fish.

34
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.070
In other words take 10 cost and we have enough food and that was it.

35
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.120
And it was amazing.

36
00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.270
Does it make you think of what the ocean must have been like before?

37
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:56.830
People fucked it up?
Of course.

38
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.500
I mean of course as a biologist that's like all I can think about,

39
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.410
<v 0>cause I was in Hawaii recently and we did some snorkeling and when you're</v>

40
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.040
swimming around with the goggles on,
looking down at the ocean,

41
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.120
one of the things that's kind of shocking is how few fish there are now.

42
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.360
Like do you think this should be like teeming with life?
You know,

43
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.020
you're over these reefs and you see like three or four fish,

44
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.580
I have fish or something like that.

45
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.940
<v 1>It's so weird.
I mean there's,</v>

46
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.090
there are these pockets left in the world that are completely untouched.

47
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.610
And it's like as soon as you get into one you can see it.
You're like,

48
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.920
this is what it used to be like everywhere.

49
00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:32.920
And it's like humans haven't had an impact.
I don't,
you know,

50
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:34.840
I don't want to disparage anyone in Hawaii,

51
00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:37.450
but I don't think there's anywhere in Hawaii like that cause it's all so

52
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:40.690
accessible and it's just,
you know,
I've,

53
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.450
I've been fortunate enough to see a couple of these pockets and they're just

54
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.040
booming with stuff and it's like this is what it could be.
Yeah.
I mean

55
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.190
<v 0>I guess that's like what it must be to just be in the Amazon itself as well.</v>

56
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.690
Right?
For sure.
The jungle,

57
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:56.360
not just the rivers and the lakes or whatever's out there,

58
00:02:56.361 --> 00:02:58.370
but the actual jungle itself,
it's,

59
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.820
<v 1>it incredible.
The jungle there.</v>

60
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.240
So we were in Columbia and Amazon and like talk about untouched by people.

61
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.570
There's been this kind of ongoing going conflict in Columbia for many,

62
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:11.530
many years.
So we're,
we were the first Westerners to go there and over 60 years.

63
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.620
So the village we flew into,
they literally never seen white people before.

64
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.070
And then we went 200 kilometers from that.
So like middle of nowhere.

65
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.250
They want to touch you.
Yeah.

66
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.800
Hair because their hair was very dark and very different.
And like,

67
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.830
I'm not particularly fair,

68
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.530
but just to touch like the hair and see the blue eyes and stuff.

69
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:28.720
They were just loving,
friendly,
super friendly.

70
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.760
Like the culture was very stoic.
Like there wasn't a lot of smiling or crying,

71
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.280
you know,
there wasn't like a lot of emotional exchange,

72
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.630
but straight away they came and greeted us like shook hands,
you know,
said hello.

73
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.920
Um,
it was really cool.
Wow.
That's got to be,
no.

74
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.520
How do you set something like that up?

75
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:50.500
Do you have like a liaison that acts as a go between,
between you and the tribes?

76
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.600
Um,
yeah,
so we did in this case have one guy who communicated,
I speak Spanish,

77
00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:59.680
Spanglish,
I guess,
and they all speak Spanish from back in the day.

78
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:03.360
So we set it all up.
It's part of the wildlife stuff that I do.
We,

79
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.290
we literally flew a DC three,

80
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.280
a World War II cargo plane into this cocaine dealers airstrip and then got,

81
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.790
that's how we got there.
I mean like mind blowing stuff,
cocaine dealer,

82
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.680
a former former former,
yeah.
Well,
you know,
TBD still Columbia.

83
00:04:17.681 --> 00:04:21.970
Right,
exactly.
Um,
so yeah,
I was,
that one was really cool.
It really remote.

84
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.140
How crazy is that?

85
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.910
They learned Spanish from people who came over on boats from Spain and it just

86
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:32.150
stuck.
Isn't that nuts?
And took over the whole like regions.
Yeah,

87
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.680
the whole world.
And Sarah's,

88
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.270
this tribe in the middle of the Amazon that has this language from another

89
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:40.280
continent.
Well and Brazil,
right from Portugal.
Right.

90
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.920
It's really incredible when you stop and think about,
I mean we,
it's,

91
00:04:43.921 --> 00:04:46.630
it's incredible,
but it's also part of,
it's a little sad.

92
00:04:46.631 --> 00:04:50.940
Like wouldn't you have loved to have heard what their original language was?
Oh,

93
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:53.230
I was literally what it sounded like.
Well,
they did.

94
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:56.260
So it's funny because when they didn't want us to understand what they were

95
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.720
talking about,
they would switch to their native Indian language.

96
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:01.330
So they still had,
they were bilingual,

97
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.400
a community of 25 people that have never left and they're bilingual.
Wow.

98
00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:09.820
It's amazing.
Now their native language is what,
what is it?

99
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.450
It's an Amazonian Indian dialect.
I,
I honestly don't even,

100
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.160
they might've said the name,
but I don't recall.

101
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.210
What is the name of their tribe also?
I'm not even sure they're,

102
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.720
they're so isolated.
They're unaware of what country they live in.

103
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.380
They don't even know that they were in Columbia.
Really?
Really?
They're just like,

104
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:30.420
to them they're Amazonian,
they're not Colombian.
Ecuadorian Brazilian there.

105
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.810
They're Amazonian,
whoa.
Yeah.
You know,

106
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.470
they just stay steady or they stay,
and the village we were in is literally,

107
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.890
I think it's all over 200 kilometers from the next,

108
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.940
next village of 15 or so people.
And they don't have fuel.
They don't have motors,

109
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:46.181
you know,

110
00:05:46.181 --> 00:05:50.920
they just in this pocket and they just substance live and they're all barefoot,

111
00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:55.200
right?
Yeah.
Do they have those crazy splayed out feet?
Big Feet,
you know,

112
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.730
cause they're there.
They're not very big people.
They're small Indian people,

113
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.790
but really big kind of useful feet and the way that,
you know,

114
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.620
they could run up and down trees and climb stuff.
And I mean,
it was unbelievable.

115
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.960
Like so much more athletic than you could imagine.

116
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.440
<v 0>Imagine right there.
They've been doing that their whole life,
their whole lives.</v>

117
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.500
When like when I say splayed out feet,

118
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:19.160
when I'm talking about as a people that walk barefoot in the jungle for long

119
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:20.270
periods of time with their whole life,

120
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.110
their toes spread out and their feet almost looked like a hand.

121
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.070
<v 1>Oh no way.
I did not like pay enough attention.
That might've been the case,</v>

122
00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:32.220
but I didn't know that at their feet.
Exactly.
Yeah.
It's kind of weird thing.

123
00:06:32.221 --> 00:06:34.620
Stare at Dude's feet.
Yeah,
for sure.
But um,

124
00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.990
<v 0>yeah,
Steve Rinella,
who's a good friend of mine told me about that.</v>

125
00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:42.460
He was in Guyana and it's the same thing and they actually got some pictures and

126
00:06:42.461 --> 00:06:44.380
videos of these people's feet,
but look at these guys.

127
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.820
<v 1>Whoa.
Oh No,
I didn't notice anything like that.</v>

128
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.880
<v 0>Yeah.
This is the,
uh,
that's uh,
how do you say that?</v>

129
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.550
Horror on not Horani Horani Horani sounds right.

130
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.120
Or Ani,
you think where Ronnie Horani Indian splayed feet.

131
00:07:02.121 --> 00:07:03.920
So it's very strange.

132
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:07.550
Like it's the kind of the opposite of what happens to women when they jam their

133
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:09.400
feet into those little pointy shoes,
right.

134
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.460
Where they get the toes kind of smoosh onto each of that late fee.
Yeah,

135
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.790
it's horrible.
Instead of that,
they're all like crazy spread out.

136
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:20.870
What in the fuck is going on there?
The guys I talk with hands,
I think.
Yeah,

137
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:24.000
the tops hands but the bottom was like would feet,
but that's,

138
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.130
that's gotta be like what?
Our feet are supposed to be probably right,
right.
Yeah.

139
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.300
Thick ass toes that actually have muscles in them that move that you can use

140
00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:34.100
like a tool like your hand.
Yeah.

141
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.240
So when these guys just can climb up trees with them so they grip the side of

142
00:07:38.241 --> 00:07:40.070
the tree with their feet like a hand.

143
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.930
<v 1>Oh,
I mean I didn't notice,
like I say the feet just like that specifically,</v>

144
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:46.900
but the way they could,
like everything's covered in mud down there.
Right.

145
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:47.411
It's all wet.

146
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:50.380
It rains every day and they could run up and down these tree trunks,

147
00:07:50.381 --> 00:07:51.610
like to get up and down the village.

148
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.080
And here's me and my crew with our awkward cameras and stuff and where it's

149
00:07:55.081 --> 00:07:58.330
slipping and sliding and falling over and like they're,
they're literally like,

150
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:00.250
what's wrong with these people?
Why can't they walk?

151
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:01.480
We must have looked like infants to that.

152
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:07.350
<v 0>Right.
And you guys probably have like boots on and shit fucked up.</v>

153
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:09.220
<v 1>Oh totally.
Yeah.
We're wearing,
you know,</v>

154
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.310
muck boots and my one buddies got waiters on and you know,

155
00:08:12.311 --> 00:08:15.010
we think we're all hard and cool because we got all this gear and they're just

156
00:08:15.011 --> 00:08:16.660
like running around in shorts barefoot.

157
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:21.260
<v 0>It is so fascinating when you see people that don't have contact with the</v>

158
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:22.760
outside world.
Like,
um,

159
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.600
I'm sure you're aware of that recent story of the missionary was killed by the

160
00:08:26.601 --> 00:08:28.560
people in north central island.
Absolutely.

161
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.690
Which is one of the weirdest places cause they've branched off from Africa at

162
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:35.350
60,000 years ago or something like that.
Right.
When,

163
00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:39.920
when you're around these people,
like what,
what do they do if they get injured?

164
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.500
So

165
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.430
<v 1>funny you asked that because we,
we kind of had that same question.
Right.</v>

166
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.580
And they don't leave.
They stay in the village.

167
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.480
They have a shaman at the village who blessed us with a crazy green powder and

168
00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:56.400
that's a whole nother story.
But they have a showman and he is their doctor.

169
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.370
<v 2>However,
he has no access to any Western medicine.</v>

170
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.400
So it's only his learning knowledge handed down through generations plus jungle

171
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:09.150
powders and whatnot.
And um,
and that's it.
So we actually,
we spent a day,

172
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:13.260
cause we had a medic with us doing like kind of village help if you will.

173
00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.200
Everybody had ringworm,
everybody had respiratory infections.
Uh,

174
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.970
there were a lot of lady problems in the village that our medic had to deal
with.

175
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.360
I mean there was a lot of health issues and you don't even realize it.

176
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.580
Write something down before I forget.

177
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:28.710
I'm sorry I was totally unrelated but no good.

178
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:33.740
There's a doctor named Peter Hotez that's coming on the podcast now to follow up

179
00:09:33.931 --> 00:09:37.230
on him.
He,
when you started talking about the people in the jungle,
he was,

180
00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:40.830
he's a actual,
a doctor who is a,

181
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:45.390
he specializes in infectious diseases and jungle and tropical climates and he's

182
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:47.850
like,
everyone's infected with something.
Everyone,
everyone,

183
00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.470
he'd have a heyday down there.
I'm sure it's probably been,
yeah.
But,
um,
the,

184
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:57.390
so when these people have ringworm and all these different infections,

185
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:01.770
do they treat it?
Do they have like some natural pathic tour or some shit?

186
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.810
I think it's kind of a 50,
50,

187
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:06.750
like a lot of it they don't treat because it's just part of everyday life.

188
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:09.810
Like when I say everybody had ringworm,
I meant everybody had it.

189
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:12.030
So I don't think there was any kind of treatment or cure.

190
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:16.300
It was just kind of part of it,
part of them.
But other things,
you know,
the,
the,

191
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.940
the witch doctor or the Shaman was trying to treat.
Um,

192
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.960
and then we kind of went in and we had like medication for ringworm.

193
00:10:22.961 --> 00:10:27.450
So we dewormed everybody and with the Shamans blessing and he was like super

194
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:30.510
excited to have western medicine in the village.
And what'd you use?

195
00:10:30.511 --> 00:10:34.620
Like Lamisil or something like that?
I couldn't tell you.
Um,
I think it was not,

196
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:35.431
it wasn't topical.

197
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:38.430
I think it was like a Wehrmacht like a pill that you take that kills the,

198
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:41.550
kills the worms.
The weird thing about that is like,

199
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:46.470
don't you,
you leave and then they're going to get it again.
Right?

200
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.080
I mean there's only so much you can do,
right?
Yeah,
totally.

201
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.390
That we were having the same dilemma and it was like,

202
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:55.830
do we interfere because we're from the outside world?
Do we help?
And uh,

203
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.070
we talked to the Shaman through our translator and he said,
please help,

204
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:03.510
please help.
So we gave,
including him,
everybody just dewormer but you know,

205
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.270
they'll just come back.
Yeah.

206
00:11:05.271 --> 00:11:08.760
And also they probably don't understand the consequences of taking some

207
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:13.170
antibiotic that's going to do some weird shit to your whole biome.
Right,
right,

208
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.320
right.
And these are all that stuff too.
It's such a moral dilemma.

209
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:20.850
You're there and you're like,
I want to help.
Do I,
is it helpful?
Is it hindering?

210
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.230
Our medic was like,
it's undeniably going to help,
you know,
they need this.

211
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.860
And so we got,
we went for it and it was,
you know,
it seemed to help.

212
00:11:28.861 --> 00:11:31.980
Everybody felt fine,
but we were only there a couple more days before we left.

213
00:11:31.981 --> 00:11:36.260
So who knows.
Wow.
When you're talking about ringworm,

214
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.030
like these guys covered in it,
you have big patches of it.

215
00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:43.180
Like what's it like feet and legs had big patches of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And this,

216
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.890
if you don't know that's the same shit that's athlete's foot.
Oh,

217
00:11:46.891 --> 00:11:50.550
I didn't know that.
I ringworm and athlete's foot of the same kind of funk.

218
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.070
Oh yeah.
That's why,
uh,
the People Tell You to pee on your

219
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.290
<v 0>feet.
I thought that was just for fun cause we,
it depends on what you're entity,</v>

220
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.120
but,
uh,
I think that's a,
the idea behind it is that you're,
um,

221
00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.530
somehow or another you're killing the bad bacteria when you,
uh,

222
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.670
you're pissing on your feet,

223
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:10.480
you have athlete's foot that that might be horseshit maybe.
Yeah.

224
00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.850
With me,
you always have to check.
Um,
yeah,
definitely give that a little looksie.

225
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.760
But,
um,
it's a real common thing which you Jitsu.
Gotcha.
So guys,
all the maths,

226
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.720
that's real common.
So it just,

227
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.870
it guys get it and there's people really fuck up or they like put bleach on it

228
00:12:28.361 --> 00:12:31.750
and a bunch of different things to try to kill it and winds up getting worse and

229
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:36.240
also of fucks up all the natural skin flora,
jock,
itch,
athlete's foot,

230
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.970
ringworm or all types of fungal skin infections known collectively as Tinea,

231
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.290
Tinea,
tinea.

232
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.710
They're caused by fungi called Derma trow fights that live on the skin,

233
00:12:47.381 --> 00:12:51.520
hair and nails and thrive in warm,
moist areas.
The jungle.

234
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.470
So it seems like they're just going to get it

235
00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.160
<v 1>it.
That's just what it sounds like,
you know?
But what did they do?</v>

236
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.370
What do they do for it?

237
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.610
I didn't see them treating that at all and when we pointed it out they're like,

238
00:13:01.611 --> 00:13:02.990
yeah,
yeah,
we know about it.
You know,

239
00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.230
they were more concerned with things that were like dire,

240
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.900
like there was an infant and maybe not even for maybe three years old and he was

241
00:13:08.901 --> 00:13:12.680
hacking up a lung and he was asthmatic according to our medic.

242
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.480
So my,
our medic gave them like an asthma medication.
And he just said,
you know,

243
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.320
if he has an attack where you kind of breathe,
give him this and like you know,

244
00:13:21.321 --> 00:13:24.020
to be super real with you.
When we walked away our medic was like,

245
00:13:24.021 --> 00:13:25.730
I doubt he'll live to see adulthood.

246
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.340
<v 0>Oh Man.
Yeah.
And You giving them inhalers,
did you give him,</v>

247
00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.740
I'm not sure to be honest.
What it was that he left with him.

248
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:35.620
And what about like injuries?
What if they break a leg or something like that?

249
00:13:35.621 --> 00:13:39.900
What do they do?
I don't think anything.
Yeah.
Was any,

250
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.150
I mean you got to think these people are climate trees.
Yeah.

251
00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:44.710
<v 1>My constantly fall get bitten by stuff.</v>

252
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:48.520
There's tons of venomous snakes out there.
It's wet,
it's muddy,
it's slippery.

253
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:52.840
They're building stuff out of very rudimentary tools.
I mean it's,
it's nuts.

254
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:53.860
They have to get injured.

255
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:59.170
<v 0>It's so interesting that we have this understanding of medicine and doctors and</v>

256
00:14:00.051 --> 00:14:03.160
hospitals,
but that's probably pretty fucked

257
00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.750
<v 1>recent.
Oh,
of course.
Yeah.
I'll,
I'll tell you a story.
Joe.</v>

258
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:12.751
I was in my Enmar earlier late last year and we're down there filming this thing

259
00:14:13.241 --> 00:14:16.300
and this kid,
like 22 year old crab fisherman gets bitten by a crocodile.

260
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.630
Oh crop grabs him by the arm,
grabs him by the thigh death roles.

261
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.630
So it breaks the arm and like,
I don't know,
15 places,
compound fracture,

262
00:14:23.631 --> 00:14:25.720
the real deal.
I could show you pictures out,

263
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:29.650
it'll blow your mind and we hear about this and we're minutes away.
We just,

264
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.260
it's kind of one of the similar situations where we're the first westerners to

265
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:33.280
be there in a long time.

266
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:38.380
We go bombing over at high speed and we get there and the mom is like off

267
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.340
mourning the death of her child but her child is sitting there still alive.

268
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.580
Like they have written him off and his mom,

269
00:14:45.581 --> 00:14:47.920
his mom is literally mourning the death of her child and he's,

270
00:14:47.921 --> 00:14:51.500
he's lying there conscious but like in total shock,

271
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.010
fortunately just because of the situation we had a speedboat,
everything else,

272
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.510
we bandaged him up.
You know,

273
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.420
ted tried to keep his arms stable and his leg stable,

274
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.480
put them in our speed boat and it was six hours by speedboat to a village that

275
00:15:02.481 --> 00:15:07.160
had a or two to a hospital.
Really.
And so he got there and his life was saved.

276
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:11.540
But I asked,
we asked the people in the village,
what were you going to do?

277
00:15:11.541 --> 00:15:13.660
And they're like,
there's nothing we can do.
Wow.

278
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.310
So he was just going to bleed out or go septic.
And that was the end of it.

279
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.440
<v 0>Ooh.
What a fucking rough way to go.
Right.</v>

280
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.150
How did he get away from the crocodile?

281
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:26.360
<v 1>Uh,
I don't know.
I think he was just hitting it or hammering on it.</v>

282
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:29.660
He was crab fishing in the water and it came up and grabbed him,

283
00:15:29.661 --> 00:15:32.390
rolled a few times,
and at some point he escaped.

284
00:15:32.391 --> 00:15:34.640
How we even got back in the boat and made it back to the village.

285
00:15:34.641 --> 00:15:37.430
I have no idea because his leg was shattered,
his arm was shattered.

286
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.260
It was brutal.
And it was a canoe,
you know,

287
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:42.710
it wasn't like he had a little motor or a wheel to drive canoed back.

288
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.450
<v 0>One of the most disturbing stories I ever read was,
um,</v>

289
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.560
these guys were kayaking in an African river and the guy in front of them got

290
00:15:49.561 --> 00:15:54.180
grabbed by a crocodile and that it went under and the like,

291
00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.710
it like plunge like a bobber as the crocodile pulled him out of the bottom of

292
00:15:58.711 --> 00:16:01.620
the Kayak.
I'm like,
fuck,
that's awful.

293
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.720
Imagine being the guy behind him

294
00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:07.180
<v 1>and Washington watching.
Yeah.
And knowing that you're pretty much helpless.</v>

295
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.110
Did you see any jaguars or anything?
Uh,
I've never seen a Jaguar.

296
00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:13.900
I've seen a lot of la.
I'm from Africa.
I don't know if you knew that,
but,

297
00:16:13.901 --> 00:16:17.430
so I've seen a lot of lions growing up.
My family did safaris.
Um,

298
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.320
and then I've seen,
you know,
mountain lions here in California,
a leopard,

299
00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:23.690
stuff like that.
I've never seen a wild Jaguar.
Really?
Yeah.

300
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.680
When you were in the Amazon,
I think they're really elusive.

301
00:16:26.681 --> 00:16:28.750
I know there's areas that are our hot spots.

302
00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.530
All of the locals were very nervous and kind of knew about them.
Like,
you know,

303
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.800
I went out for Bush walks at night and stuff and I'd just go,

304
00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:39.750
me and one guy with a camera and a,
they were like,
oh,
be careful like pedagogues.

305
00:16:39.751 --> 00:16:42.250
So in a very dangerous don't do it.
Um,

306
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.410
but prior Grosso means very dangerous.
Peligroso is danger.
Yeah.

307
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.370
And I'm so we just go and you know,

308
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.660
I'm not trying to act like we were tougher than them or anything.

309
00:16:52.661 --> 00:16:55.540
We would love to have seen one,
but they were very aware of them.

310
00:16:55.541 --> 00:16:58.200
So they were there.
We just didn't happen to run into one.
Sort of like

311
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.060
<v 0>mountain lions.
Exactly like the,
they say that mountain lines are like,</v>

312
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:03.890
if you live in a place that has them,
you know,

313
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.080
Wyoming or Colorado or something like that,
they know where you are.
Right,
right.

314
00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.060
They might be around you all the time and you might rarely see them.
Exactly.

315
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.650
Be Driving home and see one skittering into the,
into the

316
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.570
<v 1>bush.
There was a nuts video,
I think it was from the La area.
Did you ever see it?</v>

317
00:17:18.571 --> 00:17:22.020
Where the security cams picked up this mountain lion that was walking through

318
00:17:22.021 --> 00:17:25.680
this like very residential neighborhood and you'd see like people would walk by

319
00:17:25.681 --> 00:17:29.040
and then 30 seconds later he'd like tip out of the shadows and then dip back in

320
00:17:29.041 --> 00:17:31.890
and then the next set of people would walk by and nobody had any clue he was

321
00:17:31.891 --> 00:17:35.400
there.
Yeah.
It's crazy that it was a giant Predator can move around like that.

322
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.800
Right?
Yeah.
So when you're there,
like

323
00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.730
<v 0>what would you have done if someone got bit by a venomous snake or a spider or</v>

324
00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:45.100
something like that.
Did you guys have any antivenom?

325
00:17:45.101 --> 00:17:46.750
Were you prepared for something like that?

326
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.580
<v 1>I mean,
that's my department,
right?
Like as the wildlife that's,
that's kind of my,</v>

327
00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.890
my department is make sure nobody gets bitten,

328
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:56.220
make sure nothing like that happens.
And we handled very,

329
00:17:56.430 --> 00:18:00.540
very many venomous snakes and caught anacondas and all kinds of great stuff.

330
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.350
We did have like my main camera,
Guy's name's Mitch,

331
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:08.250
he got absolutely lit up by these wasps one night and we all were,

332
00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:10.080
we got like 1214 stinks each.

333
00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.770
But I look back in the canoe at one point and his eyes are just super swollen.

334
00:18:13.771 --> 00:18:15.700
He's bright red,
he's sweating.
I'm like Mitchie.
Okay.

335
00:18:15.701 --> 00:18:18.510
He's like his throat started to close up.

336
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:22.080
He was having an allergic reaction so we had to hit them with anti histamines

337
00:18:22.081 --> 00:18:26.010
and I,
I'm not actually sure if the medic administered the Epi pen or not,
but uh,

338
00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.020
he was like,
we're in the middle of the jungle.

339
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.800
We're six hours from a village that's then a full day's travel by a charter

340
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:35.400
plane from a hospital.
I mean,
middle of fucking nowhere.
And uh,

341
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:38.940
and his throat's closing up and think that's why we take a medic with us.

342
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:40.590
Thankfully we had this emergency medic,

343
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:44.490
he administered the antihistamines and Mitch was okay,
but these things do happen

344
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:47.180
<v 0>to whoever.
Like while you were on these crazy adventures,</v>

345
00:18:47.181 --> 00:18:51.920
do you ever out there going,
this is the last one?
No,
no,
no.
Ever.
No Way,
man.

346
00:18:51.921 --> 00:18:55.190
I love it.
I live for it.
Wow.
How long have you been doing this?

347
00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.600
<v 1>I mean like for TV,
for Animal Planet,
uh,</v>

348
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:01.470
three years I guess,

349
00:19:01.471 --> 00:19:05.730
but to go and the reason I got into that and doing it for TV is because I've

350
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:10.050
been doing it like my whole life.
I grew up in Zimbabwe.
My mom was a bush pilot,

351
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.730
so when we weren't on Safari,

352
00:19:11.731 --> 00:19:14.430
she was like flying us these remote place in the middle of the Bush and we were

353
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:19.080
going out on safari and like as long as I can remember,
this has been what I do

354
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.990
<v 0>now.
When you go on Safari,
you and those open jeeps walking safaris.
Whoa.</v>

355
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.770
Yeah.
What are you doing?

356
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.200
We take a four or five,
eight an elephant gun,

357
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.340
put it on your shoulder and it helps walking safari.
God Damn Man.

358
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:36.740
Only during the day,
right.
Obviously cannot move at night.

359
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.600
And what do you do when you're confronted?
Okay.

360
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.160
<v 1>I mean,
I've had some pretty close calls.
My wife Jess,
he's here with me.</v>

361
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:47.870
I saved her from a hippo.
Oh yeah.
We've had some pretty close calls

362
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.070
<v 0>and one of my scariest pictures I ever saw was this guy,</v>

363
00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.220
this African guy running down the street.
And a hippo was chasing him.

364
00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.520
And you look at the size of the hippo and you're like,
good Christ.

365
00:19:57.521 --> 00:19:58.480
That thing is huge

366
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.370
<v 1>there Joe.
They are the scariest animals on earth,</v>

367
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.450
like interacting with a hippopotamus there.
So erratic.
They're so unpredictable.

368
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.490
If they feel threatened at all,
I mean,
yeah,

369
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:12.020
<v 0>they're just,
this video is fucking bananas.
Oh yeah.
This is,
this guy's on a row,</v>

370
00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.130
a motorboat and the hippo is swimming after him like a torpedo.

371
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.920
So this is where I'm from.
This is Zimbabwe.
Really?
Yeah.

372
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.190
So it was this common that they swim that fast.

373
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.121
<v 1>They can move.</v>

374
00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:26.660
I mean this is that this is uncommon to have one chase the boat and come that

375
00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:28.040
close.
But a fuck

376
00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:29.870
<v 0>can big it is,
man.
Yeah.</v>

377
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.220
So when you've had these close encounters,
what do you do?

378
00:20:34.221 --> 00:20:37.130
You shoot at the air it shoot at the ground,
scare him away.

379
00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.950
<v 1>Fortunately I've,
I've never had to put an animal down,</v>

380
00:20:39.951 --> 00:20:42.890
but I know people that have,
does the picture look at it?
That's it.

381
00:20:42.891 --> 00:20:44.260
That's the one.
What

382
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:49.180
<v 0>in the fuck?
How fast is big bastard run?
Ah,
I don't know.</v>

383
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:52.360
You'd have to look up the exact speed,
but definitely at top speed.

384
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:55.030
Definitely faster than human,
but they don't have the maneuverability.
You know,

385
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:56.890
you can kind of duck and dodge behind trees.

386
00:20:56.891 --> 00:21:01.170
They're just don't run a straight line.
Exactly.
Yeah,
exactly.
Fuck that.
20 miles.

387
00:21:01.171 --> 00:21:03.520
Miles 19 yeah.
Yeah.
What does a person run?

388
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:08.710
A Rhino runs 31 Jesus Christ.
She's a fucking Cheetah.

389
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:13.220
Can run 75 miles an hour.
Huh?
I thought it was like 50 ah fuck yeah.

390
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:17.290
Stephanie five a crocodile's almost as fast as the fucking hippo.

391
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.010
They're including miles an hour for a croc.

392
00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:26.250
Fuck that be for sprinters around 2122 maybe sustain.

393
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.730
Yeah.
That's also a sprinter and rice and a sprinter.

394
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.670
Doughy white guy like us.

395
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:37.750
Fuck Jesus Christ.
So you just,

396
00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.330
if you're chased by a hippo,
is there a move that you do?

397
00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:43.500
Do you just have to go left and right?
Zigzag?
Yeah.
Maneuverability gets,

398
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:44.950
so like when we got chased,

399
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.040
we got behind a termite mound and then it kept going straight,

400
00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:52.780
like hiding behind termites.
Nothing says safety,
like termites.

401
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.580
Oh my God,
dude,
that's so crazy.
Fuck man.

402
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:58.180
Is that this?

403
00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.560
So that's the scariest thing in Africa in terms of like interacting with human

404
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:06.580
beings.
You know what the scariest thing in Africa is?
Mosquitoes.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah,

405
00:22:06.581 --> 00:22:10.660
of course.
Right.
Like all old stuff,
you can see all the big wildlife,

406
00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:13.990
you can kind of feel it out and you put yourself in the bad situations.

407
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:17.230
Mosquitoes,
there's nothing.
You know what I mean?
You just,
you can do about it.

408
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.460
Yeah.
My Buddy Justin wren,
he runs fight for the forgotten charity.

409
00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:25.000
They build wells for the pygmies.
Okay.
And He's been bitten.

410
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:27.450
He's gotten malaria three times.
Yeah.

411
00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:31.630
And one time he got it like he didn't even get bit again.

412
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.050
The malaria just returned lift.

413
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:38.870
So it must be in some way systemic,
I think.
I believe it is.
I don't,

414
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:42.580
I don't never had it.
Knock on wood,
my grandfather had it,
but I know that it's,

415
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:46.270
it,
it wrecks you for life.
Like it can come back,
you can get it again.

416
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.310
It stays with you.
I think that's his situation.
And he's a professional athlete.

417
00:22:51.311 --> 00:22:55.420
He's actually a fighter for Bellatore.
He's one of the heavyweight contenders.

418
00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:00.070
Damn.
Yeah.
As he said that it's affected his performance?
No,
I don't think it has.

419
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.760
I think a,
I think he's been okay with it.
You know,
he received treatment,

420
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:07.270
but it's definitely rectum on three separate occasions where he was,
you know,

421
00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:11.350
basically on death's door.
Right,
right.
And one of them was,
and he flying back.

422
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.131
Damn.
You know,

423
00:23:12.131 --> 00:23:16.540
and he's just sweating and it just rotting out and the inside was awful.

424
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.070
Say you want to ask what scares me?
That's it.
Yeah.
I'll take a hippo.
A snake,

425
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:25.260
a crock of Leopard.
Anything over that?
Yeah.
Malaria is terrifying.
You see,

426
00:23:25.261 --> 00:23:28.540
malaria has killed more people than anything,
ever really.

427
00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:33.580
Areas killed half the people that have ever died.
Oh my God,
that's insane.

428
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:38.150
Just make sure that's right.
There might be bullshit too.
It sounds good.

429
00:23:38.151 --> 00:23:41.620
I think it's real.
I think,
I think we actually have googled this before.

430
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:45.070
The malaria is literally killed 50% of all the people that have ever died.

431
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:47.900
That's insane.
Yeah.
It's not something that people were worried about.

432
00:23:47.901 --> 00:23:51.410
So many different things.
And you should be worried about Miskito.
Exactly.
Well,

433
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:57.110
apparently they're,
they're trying to genetically engineer mosquitoes to,
uh,

434
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.250
to,
to be void of devoid of malaria

435
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:02.720
<v 1>and they hybridize.
Right.</v>

436
00:24:02.721 --> 00:24:07.250
So my understanding is the way that it's done is they genetically engineer the

437
00:24:07.251 --> 00:24:08.930
males to reproduce what the females,

438
00:24:08.931 --> 00:24:13.610
which are the malaria carriers and then the offspring of that generation can no

439
00:24:13.611 --> 00:24:14.660
longer carry malaria.

440
00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:20.110
<v 0>Yeah.
Okay.
Malaria killed half the people who've ever lived.
That is bonkers.</v>

441
00:24:20.111 --> 00:24:22.420
It's a myth.
Yeah.
It would have had to kill,

442
00:24:22.421 --> 00:24:26.170
it says like five and a half million people on average per year every year for

443
00:24:26.171 --> 00:24:29.950
all of human history.
And that's not a thing.
It kills half a million a year.

444
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:30.910
I think the real numbers,

445
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.220
like half of this said it would have to be five and a half a minute.
Okay.

446
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.370
So it's just one of those things that people say.
Yeah,

447
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:39.490
I like it when I should probably shut the fuck up.
But what else is new?
Um,

448
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:44.260
so how many people have they killed?
A lot.
Okay.
We'll go with a lot.

449
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.180
So there other diseases like typhoid and shit,

450
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:53.900
isn't there like a fucking case of typhoid in California now?
Right?

451
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:59.310
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Well,
we've got some weird situations in this country with,

452
00:24:59.311 --> 00:25:04.270
um,
you know,
measles,
returning and polio returning all these bullet came in.

453
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:09.190
Yeah.
What the Hell Nah outbreaks expands in La and Long Beach.

454
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:12.530
Jesus.
Cool.
Thanks for having me down here Joe.
Congratulations.
Decision.

455
00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.910
It was my hand was sweating when they're different,
but it's different.

456
00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:19.930
It's similar but different.
It's not typhoid.
It's typhus.
Oh really?

457
00:25:19.931 --> 00:25:24.430
Borne disease that can be treated with antibiotics or something.
Yeah.

458
00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.700
I'm terrified of Lyme disease too.
Have you had Lyme?
No,

459
00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:30.310
but I have a gang of friends that have had it and it,
her Wrexham.

460
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.370
Will you spend a ton of time hiking around and stuff out here?
Yeah.

461
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.050
Well California doesn't have much Lyme,
but east coast it's horrific.

462
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:41.070
It's like everybody that spends time outdoors in the northeast seems to get.

463
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.540
Yeah.
And I don't know what you can do about that.

464
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:47.730
There was a vaccine that they were doing for a while,
but um,

465
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.090
one of my friends,

466
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.840
her dad actually got Lyme disease from the vaccine.

467
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.710
Like he didn't have it,
got vaccinated and wound up catching it from the vaccine.

468
00:25:56.711 --> 00:25:59.950
And I think they were like,
okay,
fuck this proxy.
Sorry.

469
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.800
Cause they had it for a while.
I've done,
that's no fun.
Yeah.

470
00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.450
So when you were a kid you were,
you were doing this,

471
00:26:07.451 --> 00:26:10.810
like you've been involved.
So this is like the family business,

472
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.230
<v 1>sort of.
My family business,
my mom's business actually was safari businesses.</v>

473
00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.940
So like,
like you say,
sit in a land rover,
CD,
animals kind of thing.
Um,

474
00:26:19.941 --> 00:26:22.220
and they did a little bit of tourists walking safaris.

475
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:25.940
But then I grew up on a farm in the outskirts of Harare,
Zimbabwe.

476
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.540
And then whenever I wasn't in school,
I was on the farm run around barefoot,

477
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:33.830
catching snakes,
fishing,
Yada Yada.
And then when my mom wasn't booked up,

478
00:26:33.831 --> 00:26:36.950
she had this little Bush plane that she used for safaris and we'd just adventure

479
00:26:36.951 --> 00:26:37.830
all over Africa or Africa.

480
00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.230
<v 0>Wow.
So it was great childhood.
That sounds amazing,
but fucking terrifying.</v>

481
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.543
I mean

482
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.400
<v 1>it's like one of those things where it's what you're used to write.</v>

483
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:51.870
I found moving to the states at age 14 and like trying to find my place in the

484
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:54.840
world,
being this weird little private school kid from Africa,

485
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.550
way more terrifying than going to meet a tribe in the middle of the bush.
Really?

486
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.550
For sure.
Why?
Um,
like I'll give you examples.

487
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:06.660
Like I always carry a pocket knife on me,
right?
My first day here in the states,

488
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.300
I go to school,
pull my pocket,

489
00:27:08.301 --> 00:27:11.400
I'm sitting in my uniform because I went to a very proper English boarding

490
00:27:11.401 --> 00:27:14.070
school,
pull out my pocket and I started cutting my apple.

491
00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:17.910
15 minutes later I'm in handcuffs and I'm like,
what did I do?
What did I do?

492
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:19.770
I literally had no idea what I had done wrong.

493
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.120
It was because I had a knife at school.

494
00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.270
Everybody I'd ever been to school with had a knife to cut their apple.

495
00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.230
Like it was the standard thing.
So here I am with like police and you know,

496
00:27:28.231 --> 00:27:31.650
guns and badges and they're throwing me in handcuffs and taking me out of the

497
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:33.750
school on day one in America.
And I'm like,

498
00:27:33.751 --> 00:27:35.550
this is the scariest thing I've ever seen.

499
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.880
And I didn't even learn until later that day that it was because I had a pocket

500
00:27:38.881 --> 00:27:41.790
knife.
And at no point did I think having a pocket knife was a bad thing.

501
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.960
So they didn't tell you?
No,
they just grabbed me.
There was like this whole thing,

502
00:27:45.961 --> 00:27:48.810
like the knife went flying,
I was chained up and I was like,
what's going on?

503
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:52.890
What's going on?
And they're like,
you're in big trouble.
And it's like,
why?
And uh,

504
00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:55.500
you know,
it was like little culture shock,
things like that.

505
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.310
That to me were like something I had done every day my whole life and now I'm

506
00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:01.380
like getting thrown in Juvie for it kind of thing.

507
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.810
When you think back about that,

508
00:28:03.811 --> 00:28:07.350
do you think that's just the consequences of being in a large population?

509
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:12.240
For sure.
Yeah.
I mean like we,
like I say,
I went to school every day with a knife.

510
00:28:12.241 --> 00:28:14.520
There was no violence issues,
there was nothing like that.

511
00:28:14.521 --> 00:28:17.700
But then you come here where you know the stabbings and stuff like that.

512
00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:19.760
And it's because,
you know,
we had a tie.

513
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.780
I lived in a tiny country with a tiny population.

514
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.410
Do you think that it's possible that,
I mean,
I mean it's stupid,

515
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:28.500
but there's no way you could live like that over here.
I mean,

516
00:28:28.501 --> 00:28:31.020
there's no way you could have kids with a bunch of knives.
No,

517
00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.780
I don't think it would.
Just culture.
I don't think so at all.

518
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:36.960
I think that would be terrible.
And I get it now as an adult,

519
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.560
nobody talked to you about it before you left the house?
No,
my mom didn't know.

520
00:28:40.561 --> 00:28:44.500
She's from Africa.
You know,
she's like,
here are your things.
Here's my cool.

521
00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:48.000
Put it,
sharpen it before you got us to tell a man.
Wow.

522
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:52.570
So you were doing these always doing these walking safaris.
You,

523
00:28:52.571 --> 00:28:55.320
you started out doing the driving ones and then eventually you started doing the

524
00:28:55.321 --> 00:28:58.770
walking ones.
Uh,
my family business did walking as far as they didn't do hunting,

525
00:28:58.771 --> 00:29:01.830
it was all photographic.
Um,
and we were in the Zambezi valley.

526
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:03.810
So as Mbz River's one of the biggest rivers in the world.

527
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.140
So we do these walking safaris and then we did canoes safaris as well,

528
00:29:07.141 --> 00:29:10.590
which is why I have so many hipbone crock stories cause we'd be canoeing down

529
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:14.760
the Zambezi river.
Um,
and then taking photographs and seeing wildlife that way.

530
00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.210
Wow.
What a crazy way to grow up man.
It was awesome.

531
00:29:18.211 --> 00:29:19.770
Your relationship to wildlife,

532
00:29:19.771 --> 00:29:23.940
it's just so different than the average person in this country for sure.

533
00:29:23.941 --> 00:29:25.610
It's very intimate.
Like I,

534
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.970
I feel like I have like regardless of being a scientist by trade,

535
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:33.090
I feel like I have a very intimate understanding of animals cause I grew up

536
00:29:33.091 --> 00:29:36.540
completely surrounded by them.
Now what other countries have you explored?

537
00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:42.130
I'm over 60 countries now.
Yeah.
So a lot all for wildlife work,

538
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:47.110
whether it's for the show that I do or for biology contracts before I did the

539
00:29:47.111 --> 00:29:51.160
show or just because like for instance,
when I got done with college,
I was like,

540
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.130
I had a little tiny little business starting college,
sold it and was like,

541
00:29:54.131 --> 00:29:56.650
I'm going to travel the world and try and photograph these animals.

542
00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:58.720
And I went to 28 countries looking for wildlife.

543
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:03.100
Did you have something to do with looking for the Tasmanian Tiger?
Yeah.
Yeah,

544
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:04.870
I did know.
What do you think?

545
00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:10.240
I think of all of the extinct animals that have gone extinct at the hand of man,

546
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:12.760
given the range,
I don't know if you know this,

547
00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:14.770
but the Tasmanian Tiger at one point range from pop,

548
00:30:14.771 --> 00:30:18.280
one in Guinea all the way down to Tasmania.
So not just the island of Tasmania,

549
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:22.030
but thousands,
tens of thousands of miles.
I think given the range,

550
00:30:22.031 --> 00:30:23.500
the frequency of sightings,

551
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:28.810
the amount of untouched habitat in Australia and Tasmania and Papa New Guinea

552
00:30:28.811 --> 00:30:31.810
where they just found a new dog species by the way.
They did.
Yeah,

553
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.630
the Highland dog and New Guinea,
uh,
maybe a year ago now.

554
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.270
Incredible looking animal like absolutely.

555
00:30:37.271 --> 00:30:40.840
Could there be a very small remnant population of thylacine Tasmanian Tiger

556
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:44.620
hiding out in a isolated pocket of habitat?
I totally think it's possible.

557
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.630
And these sightings,
are they coming from credible sources?
So I did,

558
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:50.800
I did one expedition.

559
00:30:50.801 --> 00:30:53.050
I've done two expeditions looking for title scene and one of them,

560
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:58.080
I was literally talking to the man who is the head park ranger for like the

561
00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:02.980
entire north Queensland.
So He's a scientist by trade,
a biologist by degree.

562
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:05.120
And he says,
I saw four of them.
Whoa.
You know,

563
00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:08.380
so this isn't like some crackpot drunk who's like,
yeah there they're here.

564
00:31:08.381 --> 00:31:11.740
You know,
this is a guy who is like myself,
a scientist,
a biologist,

565
00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:14.950
and spent his life in the bush.
He knows every animal in that area.
And he goes,

566
00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:16.600
I saw four of them.
Wow.

567
00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:19.060
So like how do you not like I get goosebumps talking about it.

568
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:22.240
Cause how do you not like take that as credible?
No,

569
00:31:22.241 --> 00:31:25.150
that's about as credible to gets,
well look at that cool looking dog.
There it is.

570
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.750
What a freaky looking at the world's rarest and most ancient dog's been

571
00:31:28.751 --> 00:31:29.860
rediscovered in the wild.

572
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.910
So this New Guinea Highland dog was thought to be extinct.
Is that the right?

573
00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:37.750
That's right.
Yup.
Wow.
So this thylacine,
this area is where,

574
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.070
where they are.
Has there been a concerted effort to find these things?
Sort of.

575
00:31:42.071 --> 00:31:42.611
I mean it's,

576
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:46.420
it's one of those things where like I would say the thylacine is like the icon

577
00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:49.030
of animals coming back from extinction for Australia.
Right.

578
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:52.360
It's Kinda like everybody knows about it in Australia,
they're all care about it.

579
00:31:52.361 --> 00:31:56.800
But where these efforts are is like outside of Sydney or you know what I mean?

580
00:31:56.801 --> 00:31:58.060
It's,
it's close to home.

581
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:02.470
So there hasn't been a lot of expeditions really deep in to look for him and

582
00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:06.850
that's what I did.
So there's so much belief that the animal is still out there,

583
00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.470
that the uh,
oh shoot,
it's the university in cans.

584
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.120
I'm blanking on the name of it right now.

585
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.350
The university itself put money towards funding to find it.

586
00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:21.190
So when you have a credible institution like a university going,
here's money,

587
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:23.740
go and find this thing.
You've got to think,

588
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:25.690
and I'm not a big conspiracy theorist,
but you've got to think,

589
00:32:25.691 --> 00:32:28.030
they have some Intel that says,
look,

590
00:32:28.031 --> 00:32:30.400
we're not wasting our money to look for something that's not there.

591
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.990
We've heard something,
we've seen something,

592
00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:34.060
we caught something on a trail camera,
let's prove it.

593
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:37.030
And so actually teamed up with it caught something on a trail camera.

594
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.770
Hard to say.
But what they did do is fun this expedition.

595
00:32:39.771 --> 00:32:44.480
So myself and the university who still ongoing with the research when it looked

596
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.490
in this area in north Queensland where I went and how far deep did you go in?
Uh,

597
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.340
1200 miles.
1200 miles.

598
00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.360
Took 14 hours driving and then hiking from there.
Whoa.
Yeah.

599
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.570
14 hours on dirt roads because this is the area where they've incited the most

600
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:03.320
numerous,
uh,
this is where that citing that I was talking about came from,

601
00:33:03.321 --> 00:33:05.990
from the biologist as well as,
I think for other sightings.

602
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:08.830
The community up there is a place called Portland roads.
You,

603
00:33:08.890 --> 00:33:12.920
you could look it up.
I think it's 12 people and wow.

604
00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:16.640
Live totally not like the Amazon off the grid,
but off the grid,
you know,

605
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:20.110
it's all like solar energy and build it yourself.
There's no power lines,
blah,

606
00:33:20.111 --> 00:33:20.660
blah,
blah.

607
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.620
So it's just this small group of kind of like people in the middle of nowhere

608
00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:27.800
and almost everybody in that community has seen them.
So that's,

609
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.010
that's where we based it out of.
And then went deep from that,

610
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.770
almost everyone in the community and no one's took a photograph that they have

611
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:37.730
cameras,
everybody's,
you know,
everybody's got a cell phone kind of thing.

612
00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:40.970
But it's like,
it's all,
it's always the same story where it's like,
yeah,

613
00:33:40.971 --> 00:33:43.350
it was there.
It was late at night by the time I reached in my pocket,

614
00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:46.460
it had gone off except for the biologist I was telling you about who said it?

615
00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:50.990
Ran around with his dogs.
Yeah.
He's out camping and he's like,
oh,

616
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:53.870
there's this red eye shine.
And my dog goes nuts and runs over there.

617
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.840
And then there's four thylacine jumping around with my dog,

618
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.470
like for like 15 minutes.
And he's like,
I'm trying to get a picture.
And you know,

619
00:34:00.471 --> 00:34:01.790
that's,
that's like 300 yards away.

620
00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:05.570
It's in the dark and without the flashlight and the phone and like,
fuck.
Yeah.

621
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:09.260
It's like,
it's basically 100% of those things alive.
I mean,

622
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:12.910
as a scientist you can never put that in number,
but two pretty yes.

623
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.560
That's why I've done two expeditions and I plan on doing more.

624
00:34:15.561 --> 00:34:18.860
I feel it's out there.
Like it's a gut feeling that it's there.

625
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:22.550
Did you ever see that?
Um,
there was a Willem defoe movie.
Yeah.
The hunter.

626
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:25.690
The hunter.
That's right.
And he goes and shoots the last one bastard.

627
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:30.880
It was a weird movie.
It wasn't weird movie.
It didn't really work.
Right.
Move.

628
00:34:30.881 --> 00:34:32.330
It was off.
It was very strange.

629
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:36.240
And there was like a scientific reason you had to find it or kill it or I don't

630
00:34:36.241 --> 00:34:39.920
know.
It was when someone was paying him,
wasn't it someone hire him to do it,

631
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.090
but wasn't there a,

632
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:44.930
like he was a bounty hunter for the animal because it had some weird genome or,

633
00:34:44.931 --> 00:34:48.890
I don't remember.
It was weird.
Yeah.
So,
but that's how they died off.
Right.

634
00:34:48.891 --> 00:34:52.130
People hunting them,
put a bounty on them.
That's how bad it was.
Yeah.

635
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:56.780
When settlers came to Tasmania,
which was the last stronghold forum.
Um,

636
00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:57.470
they were,

637
00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:00.200
they were killing sheep and sheep farmers things and the government was like,

638
00:35:00.201 --> 00:35:03.740
get rid of him,
you know,
put a bounty on him.
What year was this?
Uh,

639
00:35:03.741 --> 00:35:06.980
you'd have to cross check.
It's been a while since I've read,
read up on that.

640
00:35:06.981 --> 00:35:10.010
But the last ones died off in like the early 19 hundreds.
Right.

641
00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.820
They're all freaky looking animal.

642
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.180
There is one set of footage from it ever from the one in the Hobart Zoo.

643
00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:21.590
And it's,
you look at it,
it's insane looking creatures.
Yeah,
just nuts.

644
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.550
You got that to play the video playing.
Oh,
some plan.
Um,
yeah.

645
00:35:25.551 --> 00:35:28.330
It's a freaking animals.
It doesn't even look real.
It looks like,
oh,

646
00:35:28.331 --> 00:35:31.100
like a cross between a tiger and a dog or something.
And it's,

647
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.640
and it's kangaroo by genetics.
It's a marsupial.

648
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:38.190
So it's got a pouch and it's just so weird.
Stripes.
And that's a strange

649
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.910
<v 2>thing about Australia and that whole area.
It's like how did what,</v>

650
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:43.860
what's this marsupial thing and why didn't that catch on anywhere else?

651
00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.430
There it is.
Look at him.
Is that freaky thing and wait till you see the,

652
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:51.180
there's a shot where he kind of turns his face and does like a yawn and you'll

653
00:35:51.181 --> 00:35:55.230
see he can open his jaw the way like a snake does to almost 180 degrees.

654
00:35:55.231 --> 00:35:59.040
I mean it's,
it's bizarre.
Yeah.
To swallow.
Well,

655
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.470
coyotes are kind of like that too.
Not quite so extreme,
but right.

656
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:07.480
When you see a coyote yawning,
you're like,
what the fuck?
Look at that.
Oh,

657
00:36:07.481 --> 00:36:11.340
that's so crazy.
Isn't that insane?
Yeah.
It's like a crocodile almost.
Yeah.
Yeah,

658
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.760
yeah.
That's strange animal man.
I'm,
I'm obsessed with them.

659
00:36:14.761 --> 00:36:19.440
I'm totally fascinated by him.
Yeah.
I hope you get a photo of these fuckers.

660
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.880
Me Too.
And did they,
so I have in that area,

661
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:28.180
did you guys set up trail cams and we did 200 trail cameras.
Wow.
Yeah.

662
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.350
And then the university that we partnered with who didn't go as remote as we
did,

663
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:33.030
but they're still doing a big area.

664
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.600
I think they have ten thousand ten thousand trails.
Something crazy.

665
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:40.050
Like maybe it's a thousand.
It's a huge number.
So what do you do with those?

666
00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:43.050
How does that work?
So you do like a grid pattern,
right?

667
00:36:43.051 --> 00:36:45.810
So you know how trail camera works,
motions to activated,
blah,
blah,
blah.

668
00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:48.750
So they just,
they literally,
here's the mountains,
here's whatever.

669
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.960
And they set out all these uh,
like undergrads and they're like,

670
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:56.250
place one every 300 meters pointing in this direction,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

671
00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:00.360
And they just do a grid and they do that for a month,
two months,
whatever it is,

672
00:37:00.361 --> 00:37:03.300
collect them all and then move to the next grid and then move to the next grid

673
00:37:03.301 --> 00:37:07.080
and just blanket the area.
And I think I could be wrong on this,

674
00:37:07.081 --> 00:37:08.790
but I think the search that they're doing,

675
00:37:08.791 --> 00:37:12.480
the university is going to be the most comprehensive trail camera survey ever

676
00:37:12.481 --> 00:37:15.900
conducted.
And so as far as you know,

677
00:37:15.901 --> 00:37:19.440
they don't have a photo of one yet as far as we know.
But think of it this way,

678
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.130
and again,
I'm not a big conspiracy guy,
but if you're,
if you're a university,

679
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.920
might be one.
It's like my,
that's probably as close as they have.

680
00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:29.610
There's a lot of these could be.
There's a new one that just came out.

681
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.080
Oh,
see,
to me that's a Mangy Fox.

682
00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.680
That's not a thylacine.
No,
look at the base of the tail is very thin.

683
00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.680
It's caring and an upward curve instead of straight.

684
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:43.630
Like if you look at Kangaroo's tail,
it's very flat.
Um,

685
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.700
there's a lot of Fox problems in Australia where they're introduced could be

686
00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:50.100
wrong.
Um,
you know,
as a scientist,

687
00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:52.950
I try not to get too excited when I see something that I'm like,
this is it.

688
00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:55.920
But it's hard to tell because of the way the grass is.
For sure.

689
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.410
He's got stripes on his back.
Tiger.
Wow.

690
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:03.720
A trail cam has captured an image that has excited Tasmanian Tiger hunters to

691
00:38:03.721 --> 00:38:07.920
the possibility of the animal may roam freely across Australia.
Wow.

692
00:38:07.921 --> 00:38:11.070
How big is that thing?
Uh,
they're like coyote sized.

693
00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:15.660
We've very similar to a coyote and size.
Wow.
Yeah.
So,
um,

694
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.290
don't you think though that if they had definitive footage that they would

695
00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:21.750
release it to try to get more funding and dude,

696
00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:26.070
the problem is footage isn't definitive anymore.
Like a two years last year,

697
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.390
I got a photo of a leopard in Zanzibar.
The first time in 25 years,

698
00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:33.750
the animals declared extinct and we call it a video,
not even a photo,

699
00:38:33.751 --> 00:38:36.630
a video of a Zanzibar and uh,

700
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.030
took it up the chain and they're like into,
unless we have genetic proof,

701
00:38:40.031 --> 00:38:43.960
the animal remains extinct.
So I think,
you know,

702
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:50.050
so hard.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Come on.
Well,
um,
so yeah,
I think,

703
00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.900
I think,
you know,
if the university had something,

704
00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:56.890
they're trying to get enough data to really present a case as opposed to like,

705
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.150
you know,
throwing up a flag over something into one individual Fraser concern,

706
00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.360
that's a bunch of amateur wildlife hunters would go there.

707
00:39:04.361 --> 00:39:08.620
What does this chairman,
there it is.
That's my library is the leopard.
Yeah.
Wow.

708
00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:10.181
Did you,
uh,

709
00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:14.440
have you seen that photo or the footage rather of the Jaguar that they found in

710
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.650
Arizona?
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's really interesting to write.
Amazing.

711
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:19.270
They're starting to make their way up from Mexico.

712
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:23.200
It's such a weird region that because here's this huge Sonoran desert that you

713
00:39:23.201 --> 00:39:26.410
think none of these tropical animals can make it across.
And for whatever reason,

714
00:39:26.411 --> 00:39:30.220
southern Arizona gets Jaguars and Coda Monday and peccary and all these like

715
00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:33.580
tropical animals.
What,
what the hell?
I don't know the answer.

716
00:39:33.581 --> 00:39:34.500
What the Hell's going on?

717
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:38.290
That all these rain forest creatures are making it through this thousand mile

718
00:39:38.291 --> 00:39:43.210
stretch of desert and into southern Arizona?
Probably Board.
It could be for cool,

719
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.700
cool places to visit.
You know,
maybe they,
I mean,

720
00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:49.390
maybe it's just like a natural instinct to Rome and expand your territory.

721
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:53.020
There is,
yeah,
look at that thing.
Amazing.
That's an incredible animal.

722
00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.130
So beautiful.
And it's huge.
Huge there.
There are 200 plus pounds,
right?

723
00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:02.350
Big fucking aggressive.
Kat.
What's bigger?
A Jaguar or a leopard?

724
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.690
Leopard.
Leopard.
Yeah.
And that's even bigger,
but it's such a beautiful animal to,

725
00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.020
and apparently they were all over North America,
Jaguar point in time.
Yeah.

726
00:40:11.021 --> 00:40:15.430
Look at that area like Texas during the rezoning.
Oh,
interesting.

727
00:40:15.431 --> 00:40:18.100
I didn't even know that.
But,
um,
when did they,
I mean,
they,

728
00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:22.360
they were pushed out of,
I've,
I feel like that might not be true though.

729
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:23.560
I feel like there were,

730
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:28.450
they were more numerous in like Arizona and like the southwest makes sense.

731
00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:32.870
I mean,
you know,
we had so much mega fauna here back in the day,
um,

732
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:36.250
there would have been a lot of pray for them now because of the fact that he

733
00:40:36.251 --> 00:40:39.640
spent so much time in the wild and,
you know,

734
00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:42.270
and that you have this interest in these,
uh,

735
00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:46.630
what would you call cryptozoology animals?
I'm not a crypto guy,

736
00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:49.120
so just to be clear and nothing against crypto guys,

737
00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:52.720
but I don't do lock Nasser big foot or anything and I'm a true wildlife

738
00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:56.140
biologist,
so I only focused on wildlife.
So not to interrupt you,

739
00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:57.130
but I'm just very,

740
00:40:57.131 --> 00:41:01.870
very structured in the sense that I really only look for animals that we,

741
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.010
we have an understanding of.
Yeah.
Right.
Well,
yeah.
Well,

742
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:08.890
the big foot one is the most compelling,

743
00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:12.880
but also probably the most bullshit.
I think there's a mix there.

744
00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:17.500
I think people believe that they've seen certain things.
Um,
you know,
it's due.

745
00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:20.620
I think that there could have been large primates that we attribute to big foot.

746
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:24.250
Sure.
Whether they're still here or not,
whether people have ever seen him.
I,

747
00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.500
I'm so like not well read on that.

748
00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:31.530
Isn't it interesting though that if there was one it would probably be the most

749
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:33.950
spectacular find ever.

750
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.790
<v 0>Absolutely.
Love Nima.
We have chimps and Bonobos.
Right.
And you know,</v>

751
00:41:37.791 --> 00:41:40.880
we have all these things that are real well cause there's so much like Laura and

752
00:41:40.881 --> 00:41:44.360
culture associated with it.
Right.
And not just like our western culture,

753
00:41:44.361 --> 00:41:47.900
but like cave paintings of big hairy creatures and like everything.

754
00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.720
I mean it would be like this mind blowing discovery.

755
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:55.130
Have you ever went and looked for the Bondo ape?
No.
I know what it is,
but no,

756
00:41:55.131 --> 00:41:58.280
never gone and looked for it.
I'm sure that's a real thing.
Really.
Yeah.

757
00:41:58.281 --> 00:42:03.281
They've got skulls and hair samples and photographs and video and for people

758
00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.050
don't know what we're talking about.
It's a gigantic chimpanzee.
Right?

759
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:09.170
Like a six foot tall chimpanzee,
which is just fucking nuts.

760
00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:13.160
And it does walk a rack,
right?
Sometimes.
Yeah.
There's a camera trap photo.

761
00:42:13.161 --> 00:42:16.280
There's a guy named Doctor Carl.
Oh no,
he's not a doctor.

762
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.310
I think his name's Karl Harmon.
Karl Karl,

763
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:24.060
something harmonic Ahmad Ahmad Ahmad.
And he's a,
uh,

764
00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.690
it was it Swiss wildlife photographer.
Anyway,

765
00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:29.900
he set up a bunch of camera traps and he got one of the one walking.

766
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:35.380
It's freaking,
there's some photos of these gentlemen that shot one,
uh,

767
00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:39.320
near an airstrip.
Huh.
And it's fucking huge.

768
00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.450
You don't know how big the men are.

769
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.740
They might be small and it's in front of them,
but it is without a doubt,

770
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.750
one of the biggest chimpanzees you've ever seen in line.

771
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:52.530
They have a crest on their head.
Their skull has a crest.
Like a gorilla,
Huh.
Yeah.

772
00:42:52.531 --> 00:42:56.370
And it was like the bone of the skull has kind of fuse.
Yeah.

773
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:58.790
Which have a picture of that.
I'd love to see it.

774
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:02.360
I'm not not familiar with the anatomy of them.
Yeah.
It's,
um,

775
00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:06.230
it's really interesting because I think for the longest time they didn't think

776
00:43:06.231 --> 00:43:09.230
they were real as a part of that Michael Crighton Book Congo,

777
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.330
because remember there was a really terrible movie.
I know that little,

778
00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:17.240
the size of that fucker.
That's insane.
Yeah.
That's one of them.

779
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.170
And that thing that doesn't look like forced perspective,
you know what I mean?

780
00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.650
It looks like they're right in front of them.

781
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.680
And that's one from the early 19 hundreds I believe.

782
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:29.990
Where these guys a shot one.
And um,
there were like,
what is this?

783
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:31.900
This is just giant chimp goat.

784
00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.600
Did see if he could find the one of the red above is the one where it's walking

785
00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:40.370
right there.
Yeah.
Oh that's the camera trap.
Wow.
Walking and he's erect.
Yeah,

786
00:43:40.371 --> 00:43:44.510
he's erect.
And he's,
you know,
Izzy,
these people that,
one of,

787
00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.530
one of the sightings,
they saw one walk by a truck,

788
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.980
like walk across the road,
they said it was the same height as the truck.

789
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:53.900
That's insane.
So they have like,
you know,

790
00:43:53.901 --> 00:43:58.040
like a Toyota Helix or something like that.
And it's literally the size,

791
00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.840
the height,
like a six foot tall man,
but a giant chimp.
And I mean,

792
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.580
you know,
to go back to the big foot thing,

793
00:44:04.581 --> 00:44:06.660
you can totally see where we get that from.
Right.

794
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.730
You look at this huge primate that's the size of a human being and your brain

795
00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:12.200
instantly goes,
it's mythological.

796
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:16.670
And I'm pretty sure that they didn't have photos of this thing until the 20th

797
00:44:16.671 --> 00:44:21.020
century.
Like the late 20th century.
No kidding.
Yeah.
That's amazing.
Yeah.

798
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:24.550
It's a trip,
man.
This,
they nest on the ground.
Like I'm like gorilla the gorilla.

799
00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.070
Yeah.
Yeah.
Wow.
And uh,

800
00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:32.100
the locals have tune different names for,
uh,
two different names for chimps.

801
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.151
They call it a tree.

802
00:44:33.151 --> 00:44:37.800
Beaders and lion killers and the tree beaters are the ones that are up in the

803
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:39.000
trees,
a smaller champs.

804
00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:42.120
The lion killers are these big ones that live on the ground.

805
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:47.121
And apparently there's some either video footage or there was some eyewitness

806
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:51.790
account of one of them eating a leopard.
No.

807
00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:54.390
So it was a dead leopard that they were eating.

808
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:57.910
Whether or not they killed it or they found it,
but they were eating this fucker

809
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:02.460
<v 1>regardless like to be a primate at the top of the food chain,</v>

810
00:45:02.490 --> 00:45:05.190
eating a big cat.
I mean,
that's nuts.
It's nuts.

811
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.520
<v 0>Would you ever think of going there and trying to find those things?</v>

812
00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:13.950
They're deep in their great,
yeah,
I think they're in a place called ble,

813
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:16.110
ble in the Congo.
That's where they think they are.

814
00:45:16.111 --> 00:45:18.330
They've isolated a population of them there.

815
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.790
<v 1>Really.</v>

816
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:22.300
My mom just got back from the Congo and she still does like her own adventure

817
00:45:22.301 --> 00:45:25.330
stuff and she was saying it's just like she's been all over as well.
She's like,

818
00:45:25.331 --> 00:45:26.111
it's mind blowing.

819
00:45:26.111 --> 00:45:30.040
Like there's so much remoteness and unstudied area that there could be all kinds

820
00:45:30.041 --> 00:45:32.430
of things.
God Damn Man.
Now what,

821
00:45:32.431 --> 00:45:34.570
what kind of medication do you have to take if you're going to go there?

822
00:45:34.571 --> 00:45:37.720
Because you have to take some anti-malarial stuff,
right?
I'm a pin cushion.

823
00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.840
Like I've had so many shots and pills and you know,

824
00:45:43.271 --> 00:45:46.600
like the preventative,
obviously I actually don't do malaria medication.

825
00:45:46.601 --> 00:45:49.480
I just cover up.
Um,
because it messes with your brain.

826
00:45:49.481 --> 00:45:52.750
I don't know if you know that.
Like they say the new modern ones aren't bad,

827
00:45:52.751 --> 00:45:57.550
but the malarone like you have hallucinations at night.
You have crazy sweats,

828
00:45:57.551 --> 00:46:01.630
like,
especially if you're in hot sun.
So I,
I would rather be more focused,

829
00:46:01.631 --> 00:46:05.800
especially if I'm working with reptiles or stuff like that,
that can animate me.

830
00:46:05.801 --> 00:46:10.240
So I try,
I try to stay away from it and just cover up.
Wow.
Is there,

831
00:46:10.310 --> 00:46:10.550
<v 0>uh,</v>

832
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:15.460
a specific type of clothing that's like anti mosquito repellent clothing or

833
00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:16.080
anything?
Like

834
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.010
<v 1>I just do long sleeves and some bug spray.
And do you do a mask as well?
No.
No.</v>

835
00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:24.570
That's silliness.
Really look silly.
It does look sad.
No,
I just do,
you know,

836
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.520
good old deet.
God,
that's stuff's gotta be bad for you too though.

837
00:46:27.521 --> 00:46:30.840
Now it melts you like if you get it on,
like say these things,

838
00:46:30.841 --> 00:46:34.740
it will melt the painting,
the paint off of the headphones.
It's so strong.

839
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.320
It's probably worse than the now.

840
00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:41.350
<v 0>Have you ever used a thermostat?
What did they call the m fucking,</v>

841
00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.610
is it called Thermacell?
I think that's what's called.
Um,
it's um,

842
00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.800
it's a device that heats up.

843
00:46:47.801 --> 00:46:49.870
It's gotten like an element inside of it and like a little bit,

844
00:46:49.871 --> 00:46:54.871
a little canister of gasoline and you put these sheets and it releases this very

845
00:46:55.781 --> 00:47:00.160
fine mist kind of smell.
And mosquitoes.
Fucking hate it.
No Way.
Yeah,

846
00:47:00.161 --> 00:47:04.990
we used it in Alberta.
Alberta has very aggressive mosquitoes when they're out,

847
00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.660
when they're out,
they're out of them.
Right?
Yeah.

848
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:12.420
Cause only alive for like three months.
It's like Alaska.
You had been Alaskan,

849
00:47:12.421 --> 00:47:12.580
right.

850
00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:15.720
<v 1>It's the worst.
Mosquitoes have ever seen.
Crazy going to pick you up.
Yeah.</v>

851
00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:18.630
<v 0>Their size of pigeons and their funnel everywhere.</v>

852
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:24.240
I went fishing with my friend Ari and we pulled up the car and we got out of the

853
00:47:24.241 --> 00:47:28.830
car and we opened the car door and within seconds a swarm of mosquitoes was

854
00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:30.070
inside the car.
It's

855
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.070
<v 1>insane.
We were screaming like,
what the fuck?
This is crazy.</v>

856
00:47:33.071 --> 00:47:37.870
It's like something out of a Stephen King movie.
There's clouds and they,
I,
yeah,

857
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.210
that's why you asked me what I'm scared of it to that fucking clouds of

858
00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:41.350
mosquitoes,
man.
Well,

859
00:47:41.351 --> 00:47:44.460
we're very fortunate we don't have malaria here in the United States.
Yup.

860
00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:48.910
Absolutely.
If it,
if it made its way over here somehow,
you know,
I,
um,

861
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.680
I wear this fabric.
You're talking about Thermacell called hex.

862
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.970
Hex.
Exactly.
And,
um,

863
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.620
I worked for a lot of reasons because I definitely feel helps me get closer to

864
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:03.820
wildlife,
but I've noticed mosquitoes do not like it.
So that's,

865
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:06.330
that's one of my number a heck suit is for,

866
00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.960
for people that don't know what we're talking about.

867
00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:13.250
So it's this interwoven carbon grid that actually holds the body's electrical

868
00:48:13.631 --> 00:48:17.620
energy and capacity,
like the door of microwave oven,
like a faraday cage.
Right.

869
00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:18.300
And so you,

870
00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:21.700
you naturally admit electrical energy and then when you wear this clothing,

871
00:48:21.701 --> 00:48:24.430
it's got this conductive carbon grid and when you touch the ground or something

872
00:48:24.431 --> 00:48:28.660
at grounds it and releases all the energy.
So birds migrate or using.
Yeah.

873
00:48:28.661 --> 00:48:32.100
There you go.
Now has it been proven that this stuff actually works?

874
00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:35.740
I mean it has been proven that it has an effect on the electrical energy that

875
00:48:35.741 --> 00:48:36.181
you released,

876
00:48:36.181 --> 00:48:39.220
but has it been proven that the animals can actually recognize that electrical

877
00:48:39.221 --> 00:48:40.750
energy with certain animals?
Yes.

878
00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:45.250
So we know that electro reception is certain loud life's capable out of birds

879
00:48:45.251 --> 00:48:48.280
use it to migrate.
Sea Turtles Use magnetic poles to migrate.

880
00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.661
They just discovered,

881
00:48:49.661 --> 00:48:54.661
I believe 2014 that lobsters antenna have electrical detective sensors.

882
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:59.980
Um,
I'd like to,
reception is the word.
Um,
so it's proven on some things,

883
00:48:59.981 --> 00:49:00.970
not everything.
You know,

884
00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:05.971
our understanding of animal behavior and animal adaptability is constantly

885
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:09.040
growing.
So it's passive.
You know what I mean?

886
00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:11.960
I wear it because it's a passive technology.
It's like,
I,

887
00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:15.430
I'm going to wear a shirt anyway.
Why not wear one that might or might not help?

888
00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:19.640
So I feel it helps my friend John Dudley is a bow hunter.
Yup.

889
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:23.870
Pretty famous bow hunting.
I know John.
Yeah.
Okay.
And He,
and he swears by it.
Yeah.

890
00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:27.700
Yeah.
He wears him constantly.
He's like,
it makes a big difference.
I think so,

891
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.070
you know,
like I'm,
I'm not hunting,

892
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:32.920
I'm just trying to get close to stuff and interact with it or find something,

893
00:49:32.921 --> 00:49:35.770
but I feel it makes a difference.
Notice a difference personally,

894
00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:38.740
especially with birds.
Um,
I've noticed a huge difference.

895
00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:41.380
I've noticed a huge difference in the water.
Some mammals,

896
00:49:41.381 --> 00:49:45.910
I've noticed a difference.
Um,
but yeah,
I like John.
I feel like it's,

897
00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:49.450
it helps me get closer.
And,
you know,
keeps,
keeps the energy down.

898
00:49:49.451 --> 00:49:51.220
Do you know what I mean?
Like you're admitting all this energy,

899
00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:53.410
you see this bear or whatever it is,
your heart spikes,

900
00:49:53.411 --> 00:49:58.240
your adrenaline goes and it,
it keeps hitting capacity.
So I think we sense that,

901
00:49:58.241 --> 00:50:00.190
I think certain creatures sense that.
And I,

902
00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.420
I like to keep that out of the equation,
right?
The,

903
00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:07.210
I guess it would be that there is something coming off of your body and it

904
00:50:07.211 --> 00:50:10.600
probably would be an advantage for animals to be able to recognize that just

905
00:50:10.601 --> 00:50:12.970
because we can't quantify it,
right.

906
00:50:12.971 --> 00:50:15.280
And put it on a scale and weigh out or something like that.

907
00:50:15.281 --> 00:50:17.530
It's probably something going on Predator prey,
right?

908
00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:21.220
Like if you're aligned and I'm an,
I'm an antelope and,
uh,

909
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:23.710
my adrenaline spikes and my heart's going and you know,

910
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.800
you're going to come for me.
But if that's out of the equation,

911
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.430
the energy stays reduced.

912
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.180
<v 0>Well,
that's one of the weirder video.
Some of the weirder videos that I've seen,</v>

913
00:50:31.181 --> 00:50:34.750
I should say,
um,
is people that are interacting with predators,

914
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.250
like people that have like coyotes come right up to them while they're wearing

915
00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:41.320
those things.
And,
and Turkeys as well.

916
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.550
<v 1>Target it totally.
Like I said,
birds cause birds,
birds have that in their brain.</v>

917
00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:47.940
They have,
I'm going to quote it wrong,

918
00:50:47.941 --> 00:50:50.730
but they have something that they can detect electrical signals of what helps

919
00:50:50.731 --> 00:50:54.930
them migrate around the world.
So for sure I think it makes a difference.
Yeah.

920
00:50:54.931 --> 00:50:59.550
So what else do you use?
You use the heck suit?
A ton of different tools,
man.

921
00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:01.230
I mean I customize stuff,
you know,

922
00:51:01.231 --> 00:51:03.950
like in the Amazon we were looking for Cayman and type of crocodiles.

923
00:51:03.951 --> 00:51:07.980
So I built like a beefed up dog catcher that I used to try and last sue them.

924
00:51:07.981 --> 00:51:12.960
I have a snake hook on me at all times.
Um,
Cook.
Yeah,
it's a snake hook.
Uh,

925
00:51:12.961 --> 00:51:15.810
so it's just this like,
it's like a golf club with a hook on the end.

926
00:51:15.811 --> 00:51:19.550
So I can work with venomous snakes without reaching back and grabbing me doesn't

927
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.950
restrain them.
It,
it actually like their body sits in it.
Um,

928
00:51:22.951 --> 00:51:26.880
I do a lot of reptile stuff,
so I'm always have a snake hook on me.

929
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:29.790
I mean,
the list goes on.
Ton of trail cameras.

930
00:51:29.791 --> 00:51:32.070
I use a lot of thermal imaging stuff like,
um,

931
00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:36.410
especially like looking for wolves or something like that.
Uh,
we,
you know,

932
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.790
wolds are active at night.
It's really hard to get a shot of him,

933
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:41.460
put a thermal burden,
the air,
and you can see these,

934
00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:45.630
these animals running through valleys.
Wow.
Yeah.
It's cool stuff.
You'd love it.

935
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.540
<v 0>I'm fascinated by wolves.</v>

936
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:52.430
Wolves to me are probably the most interesting animal in the wild.

937
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:57.050
Can't candidates man.
Wild dogs of all kind are unbelievable.

938
00:51:57.051 --> 00:52:01.610
There's so at the top of their respective food chain.
Yeah.
We have a,

939
00:52:01.611 --> 00:52:05.000
a lot of coyotes around here and basically they're a little wolves,

940
00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:06.590
the little sneaky wolves,

941
00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:12.100
but a real wolves like wolves in Yellowstone wolves and the northwest area of

942
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:15.280
the United States.
Those,
there,

943
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:19.570
they have got to be some of the most majestic animals there.

944
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.230
They operate together always these packs.
Yup.
You know?

945
00:52:24.231 --> 00:52:26.900
So there's some sort of weird kind of communication and,

946
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:31.000
<v 1>and what's amazing is like the social dynamic,
like within the pack,
you know,</v>

947
00:52:31.001 --> 00:52:34.330
the hierarchy and then on a hunt like you go left,
I go right.

948
00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:38.710
But without any verbal communication and then coming together and making a kill,

949
00:52:38.711 --> 00:52:40.300
I mean it's mindblowing stuff.
You know,

950
00:52:40.301 --> 00:52:43.350
you talk about not understanding wildlife,
we don't understand how they do that.

951
00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.720
<v 0>Right,
right.
We don't understand what kind of communications going on.</v>

952
00:52:46.721 --> 00:52:51.290
Do you think there's some sort of like telepathic or is it just a facial and

953
00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:56.610
recognition recognizing cues and patterns that they've established before of

954
00:52:56.681 --> 00:52:58.450
they see an animal,
they know to flank it.

955
00:52:58.620 --> 00:52:59.880
<v 1>I definitely believe it's that.</v>

956
00:52:59.881 --> 00:53:04.320
Like I definitely believe there is an intrinsic understanding of you go left,

957
00:53:04.321 --> 00:53:07.650
I go right.
You know,
facial recognition,
you know,
your,

958
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.120
your expression tells me to do something your dominant.
I'm,
I'm passive,
you know,

959
00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.140
learning that way.
But I also think there's something more than that,

960
00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:17.520
whether it's telepathic,

961
00:53:17.521 --> 00:53:22.500
whether it's a low frequency sound that we're not audible to us.
I have no idea.

962
00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.980
But I do think it's more than just visual cues.
That's where the,

963
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:30.000
<v 0>apparently the myth of the Werewolf comes from is that wolves are so smart.</v>

964
00:53:30.001 --> 00:53:34.260
They think that wolf and a person,
we're like combined together.

965
00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.050
<v 1>I don't believe that per se,
but I can see how that came up.
You know what I mean?</v>

966
00:53:39.051 --> 00:53:42.530
It's totally,
there's so smart.
African wild dogs are the same.
Like they,

967
00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:44.240
they hunting these huge packs,

968
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:48.110
they go over these massive areas and then they'll push a single animal into one

969
00:53:48.111 --> 00:53:50.600
area to make the kill and they're not big animals there.
Again,

970
00:53:50.601 --> 00:53:53.290
like our coyote size and they'll take down,
you know,

971
00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:56.540
a kudu or some huge antelope.
I mean it's,
it's incredible.

972
00:53:56.690 --> 00:54:00.660
<v 0>Well,
African wild dogs are so cool.
Look to those black spots,</v>

973
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:04.640
yellow and all the stunning,
they just,
they look angry.
They were like,

974
00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:06.250
no,

975
00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:09.900
<v 1>there's,
I think they're,
they're my favorite of the Cam.
Like you love wolves.</v>

976
00:54:09.901 --> 00:54:13.430
I love African wild dogs.
I just think they're so beautiful and majestic and then

977
00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:17.440
<v 0>usual and they're just such a cool animal.
Correct me if I'm wrong,</v>

978
00:54:17.441 --> 00:54:19.810
but I think all of them come from the United States.

979
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.550
I think all of them originally came from North America,
like I think on,
yeah,

980
00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:28.060
all candidates came from North America.
I think that's Coyote America.

981
00:54:28.061 --> 00:54:31.540
The gentleman who has been on the podcast before,
what is his name,

982
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:37.060
is escaping me right now.
Uh,
but he,
he wrote about it,

983
00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:42.040
about,
you know,
all the various weather jackals,
Dan Flores,
Dan Flores,

984
00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:45.750
he's hit,
that is a fascinating book.
Yeah,
I'm going to write it down.
Yeah,

985
00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:49.240
I'd love to read it.
Great.
And I did a podcast with him,
uh,
years ago.

986
00:54:49.241 --> 00:54:50.110
That's excellent too.

987
00:54:50.111 --> 00:54:55.060
And he has all sorts of crazy insight as to native American,

988
00:54:55.061 --> 00:55:00.010
North American animals that went somewhere else,
like a horses.

989
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.890
Like horses were native to North America,

990
00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.800
but they weren't here when the European settlers came.
They had,

991
00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:10.270
they went extinct,
but they had been taken.
They had the,
there were other places,

992
00:55:10.271 --> 00:55:15.160
like apparently wild horses from Europe,
all originated from North America.

993
00:55:15.161 --> 00:55:18.520
And we're taking over and then brought on another,
well from whatever.

994
00:55:18.521 --> 00:55:22.690
And then when extinct here and then were reintroduced with the European
settlers.

995
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.340
Huh.
That's an interesting,
crazy.

996
00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.930
<v 1>It's fat.
And that's the thing,</v>

997
00:55:25.931 --> 00:55:29.140
like with what I do looking for extinct animals are proof that they're still out

998
00:55:29.141 --> 00:55:31.210
there is like,
there are so many stories like that.

999
00:55:31.211 --> 00:55:36.211
I didn't know that one in specific America is very well covered with eyeballs.

1000
00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:41.620
But what's to say there isn't some remnant small population somewhere in the

1001
00:55:41.621 --> 00:55:46.060
middle of nowhere that nobody has found these horses that have been untouched by

1002
00:55:46.061 --> 00:55:49.540
human beings for millennia.
Right.
And that's,
that's what I,
that's what I do.

1003
00:55:49.541 --> 00:55:52.120
That's what drives me.
Right.
Find this pocket,

1004
00:55:52.121 --> 00:55:56.830
find this animal that's been hiding out undetected for thousands of years.

1005
00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:01.270
Yeah.
So what other animals are you looking for?
A A lot.

1006
00:56:01.271 --> 00:56:02.350
Like we were talking about primates.

1007
00:56:02.351 --> 00:56:05.830
I'm going to Borneo to look for an animal called the millers,
grizzled lang gear.

1008
00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.560
It's a type of monkey.
Um,
I just got back,

1009
00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:12.350
I was looking for an extinct Cayman in the Amazon.
Think Cayman.
Yeah.

1010
00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.460
What's the difference between that and the Cayman's that you see?
A,

1011
00:56:15.461 --> 00:56:18.880
just a different species.
You know,
just like there's many types of crocodile,

1012
00:56:18.881 --> 00:56:21.640
there's nine types of Cayman,
you know,
you have salt,
water,
crocodiles,

1013
00:56:21.641 --> 00:56:23.950
now crocodiles,
same thing with Cayman.
Um,

1014
00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:27.460
and I was looking for one with a very weird morphological variants.

1015
00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:31.810
It looks very,
very different to any other,
um,
what's,
what's different about it?

1016
00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.440
It's got a very elongated snout.
Um,
if you've ever seen a gharial,

1017
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:38.500
if you know what that is,
a type of crocodile with this long crazy knows.

1018
00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.100
It's like the alligator family that came and family version of that,

1019
00:56:42.101 --> 00:56:45.820
this really long,
skinny face,
super light,
super yellow coloration,

1020
00:56:45.821 --> 00:56:46.631
just very different.

1021
00:56:46.631 --> 00:56:50.980
Last time one was seen was 52 years ago and then they had one in a zoo that died

1022
00:56:50.981 --> 00:56:55.420
in the 80s,
and nobody's found one since.
Um,
so just really cool.
And so yeah,

1023
00:56:55.421 --> 00:56:56.760
the list goes on.
You know,
I,

1024
00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:01.450
last year I did leopards and I did wolves in Newfoundland and a bunch of really

1025
00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:04.510
interesting stuff.
So it's fun,
man.
You'd love it.
You should come with,

1026
00:57:04.511 --> 00:57:09.240
I'll talk to animal planner.
Scared.
I'm such a pussy.
Um,
what about uh,

1027
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:11.560
giant Sloss?
What are your feelings on those?

1028
00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:15.280
So I've had probably three years of research into this,

1029
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:19.660
into giant slots because a man man up put agree,

1030
00:57:19.661 --> 00:57:23.950
I believe is how it's said.
It's the South American name for giant slots.
There's,

1031
00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.290
I don't want to give away too much info before I get to do a chance,

1032
00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:30.700
a chance at looking for it.
But after all the research I've compiled there is,

1033
00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:33.010
in my opinion,
one location on earth.

1034
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.670
It's in high Peru where nobody goes.

1035
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:39.850
It's a bowl of mountains impenetrable.

1036
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:44.910
The only way in is a helicopter in the center to me that that ball is going to

1037
00:57:45.551 --> 00:57:47.110
be like a primordial Eden.

1038
00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:51.730
All of the cultures surrounding it have old stories of giant slots.

1039
00:57:51.940 --> 00:57:53.320
They all have different names for it,

1040
00:57:53.321 --> 00:57:56.110
but they all have these stories of these giant slots,
right?

1041
00:57:56.111 --> 00:57:59.590
They were all hunted to extinction.
However they've handed down these traditions,

1042
00:57:59.800 --> 00:58:01.560
but nobody except for,
you know,

1043
00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:06.190
a tiny handful of like far out tribal people have ever really got into this

1044
00:58:06.191 --> 00:58:09.610
impenetrable ball.
And I think if they're anywhere,
they're in there.
Wow.

1045
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.540
I saw a documentary once about this scientist that was essentially risking his

1046
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:17.650
reputation,
trying to find a giant sloths somewhere maybe in the Amazon,

1047
00:58:17.651 --> 00:58:21.580
some somewhere.
Probably Peruvian.
Amazon.
That's where I'm thinking two and uh,
he,

1048
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:25.630
he kept talking to people that had seen it and he never could get ahold of it,

1049
00:58:25.631 --> 00:58:29.320
but he had been there for years.
Isn't that crazy though?
Like why,

1050
00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:34.300
what if you're a little Amazonian villager?
You don't read,
you don't have TV.

1051
00:58:34.301 --> 00:58:37.240
There's no reason to make up scientific,
you know,
science fiction.

1052
00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:38.800
Why say you've seen it?

1053
00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:44.260
<v 0>I like to fuck with white people.
Could be good.
They like get stringy hair.</v>

1054
00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.940
Yeah,
I seen that.
Dinosaurs

1055
00:58:49.530 --> 00:58:53.380
and you're walking,
you're exhausted.
Covered with mosquito bites.

1056
00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.650
He's like any day now.
Yeah,
just over the next hill.

1057
00:58:56.770 --> 00:59:01.030
He's just going to wait for you to fucking rot out.
That'd be a mean man.

1058
00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:04.270
That's a mean guy.
And he's like,
you mean you want to log?
All right buddy.

1059
00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.810
Pat You on the back.
This is the last spot for you.
And I'll be taking,

1060
00:59:08.650 --> 00:59:12.850
I'll take your binoculars and,
yeah,
I mean,
yeah,

1061
00:59:12.851 --> 00:59:15.390
there's no reason for them to lie,
but that doesn't,

1062
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.260
that's like the thing that people say about everything.
Why would turn lie?
Well,

1063
00:59:19.261 --> 00:59:22.030
I don't know.
People lie for a bunch of weird reasons.
People do

1064
00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:26.330
<v 2>it.
People are crazy.
They make shit up.
True.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,</v>

1065
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:30.650
to me it's like you have to take an eyewitness report of an extinct creature or

1066
00:59:31.070 --> 00:59:35.510
a zoo crypto creature with a grain of salt,
but you still have to take it.

1067
00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:38.110
Do you know what I mean?
You still have to bank it and consider it.
Yeah.

1068
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:42.170
And so that's,
that's kind of the way I go.
I,
I always talk to people,

1069
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.820
but then I come up with,
I do the biology right.
I track,
I put the cameras out,

1070
00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:48.200
I bait,
I sent,

1071
00:59:48.201 --> 00:59:52.430
I do all of that stuff to try and get evidence of my own because just going with

1072
00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:54.620
eyewitness reports is,
like you say,
it's nothing.

1073
00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:59.060
Is there ever been any eyewitness reports that are just too,

1074
00:59:59.230 --> 01:00:02.870
too ridiculous where you're like,
oh,
for sure.
Like what?
Oh Man.
Loads.

1075
01:00:02.871 --> 01:00:06.590
I mean like talking about the thylacine for instance,

1076
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:10.250
there was a guy that we met there who's like,
yeah,
their styles seen everywhere.

1077
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:13.400
They run around with the black cats and were like,
what?
And he's like,
yeah,

1078
01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:16.010
there's black panthers too.
They like hang out together length.

1079
01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.610
There's an Australian exactly that.
I made the same face you did.
So I'm like,

1080
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:23.390
okay,
tell me more.
And he's like,
yeah,
you know,
they like to hang out over there.

1081
01:00:23.391 --> 01:00:26.250
They're behind the trash heap.
They jump around with Black Panthers.
Oh,

1082
01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:29.390
they're just fucking with it.
And I'm like,
well,
that's the thing.
I'm like,
you're,

1083
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:32.060
you're just,
you're either crazy or you're completely fucking with me.

1084
01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:36.940
And I'm not sure which one it is because your eyes are telling me crazy.
Yeah.

1085
01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.310
Well,
I mean,
how many different pockets in the world are there?

1086
01:00:40.311 --> 01:00:43.880
Like that basin that you said you got to get helicoptered into?
There's a few.

1087
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.700
There's a few.
Yeah,
you'd be surprised because you know,
we're here,

1088
01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:48.860
we're in a city,
we're so used to our modern conveniences,

1089
01:00:48.861 --> 01:00:53.430
but there are totally untouched pieces of the world's still.
Well,
uh,

1090
01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:58.250
do you know David Cho,
the artist?
I don't,
he,
um,
he went to the Congo,

1091
01:00:58.310 --> 01:01:01.080
I think it was the Congo to look for a dinosaur.
No,

1092
01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:06.120
it was a really early vice piece back when vice was first starting out.

1093
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.040
And David is one of the more eccentric people that I know.

1094
01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:13.490
He's a multimillionaire.
He made a shitload of money gambling.

1095
01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:18.420
And also he made a shit load of money because he was at Facebook painted.
Yeah.

1096
01:01:18.421 --> 01:01:22.460
He painted Facebook.
What does that mean?
Like the wall?
Yeah.
The inside,

1097
01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:23.960
they hired him to paint,

1098
01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:28.520
like do these murals and they gave him stock and that stock wound up being worth

1099
01:01:28.521 --> 01:01:32.960
hundreds of millions of dollars.
And so now he's just this freaky,

1100
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:37.070
super talented artists who is just doing weird shit.

1101
01:01:37.071 --> 01:01:38.420
And one of the things they did is like,
hey man,

1102
01:01:38.421 --> 01:01:41.480
you want to go look for a dinosaur?
He's like,
fuck yeah,
I'll go,
absolutely.

1103
01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.780
Why wouldn't you?
You know,
but there's this video of him,

1104
01:01:44.781 --> 01:01:48.710
I want to say he was like 25 at the time too.
I think he was pretty young.
Yeah.

1105
01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.940
Look at them there.
Oh yeah.

1106
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.020
So he's in the jungle in search of a fucking dinosaur because,

1107
01:01:54.021 --> 01:01:57.770
and it was one of those things where the locals were saying,
Hey,
this is a,

1108
01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:02.720
there's a dinosaur in the Congo.
Right.
Which doesn't totally make sense,

1109
01:02:02.721 --> 01:02:05.930
but it,
but,
but who knows,
right.

1110
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:08.480
Why not investigate it kind of thing.
Well,
I mean,

1111
01:02:08.481 --> 01:02:13.481
how big of an area would there have to be for there to be a species that we are

1112
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:18.410
not aware of?
Like how big of an area?
Oh,
I mean,
you know,
that's,
that's,

1113
01:02:18.411 --> 01:02:20.460
it's a generic,
cause we discover

1114
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:23.130
<v 1>you'd have to look up the numbers,
but it's like 2000 new species a year.</v>

1115
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.980
But mostly little stuff.
There's an animal discovered most recently,

1116
01:02:28.981 --> 01:02:30.240
there's an animal called the [inaudible].

1117
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:34.320
It's an animal that I'm actually working on later this year.
And it is a,

1118
01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.280
an antelope,

1119
01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:38.790
like they call it the Asian Unicorn because for generations people have been

1120
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:42.240
talking about the Asian Unicorn.
And Western worlds like,
yeah,
whatever,
whatever,

1121
01:02:42.241 --> 01:02:42.870
whatever.

1122
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:46.500
And then finally somebody went down there into the Laotian mountains and,

1123
01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.740
and was like,
here's a skull and here's a skin.
And they're like,
Holy Shit,

1124
01:02:49.741 --> 01:02:53.340
this is a real thing.
And this is like in a Po,
not populated,

1125
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:56.520
but there's plenty of people living there.
You know what I mean?
This isn't like,

1126
01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:58.740
this isn't like the middle of nowhere.

1127
01:02:58.741 --> 01:03:02.160
This is where there's villages and tribes and people and they're like,

1128
01:03:02.161 --> 01:03:04.230
here's this animal,
here's the skin,
here's a skull.

1129
01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:08.900
And since then I think one trail camera has the photo has ever surfaced.

1130
01:03:08.901 --> 01:03:13.560
Like nobody's ever successfully documented it because it's just this incredibly

1131
01:03:13.561 --> 01:03:17.700
elusive animal.
Like whether it has super sensory organs,
you know,
hearing sight,

1132
01:03:17.701 --> 01:03:22.310
smell,
whatever it is,
or it's just super low density and population.
I've,

1133
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:25.380
nobody really knows.
But this animal,
this,
this huge,

1134
01:03:25.381 --> 01:03:28.680
like antelope has been around forever.
People,

1135
01:03:28.681 --> 01:03:32.160
little tribal people have been talking about it in like a mythological way.

1136
01:03:32.161 --> 01:03:35.070
The same way they would talk about dinosaurs in the Congo and the Western

1137
01:03:35.071 --> 01:03:36.840
world's going,
sure buddy,
whatever you say.

1138
01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:38.820
And then somebody finally goes down there.

1139
01:03:38.821 --> 01:03:42.540
Doesn't expedition just like David did and goes,
oh,
it turns out it's here.

1140
01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:44.193
<v 0>Wow.</v>

1141
01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:49.150
What is it about animals where we're so fascinated by the ones that might not be

1142
01:03:49.151 --> 01:03:52.830
real or that might be hidden?
Like what is it about them mean we we,

1143
01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.670
I mean people love to study.
Giraffes are things that are absolutely real sure,

1144
01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:02.700
but they also have an even more compelling need to search for things that are

1145
01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:08.740
not quite sure.
I'm not quite sure if they exist or not.
I don't know.

1146
01:04:08.741 --> 01:04:09.940
Man.
I think it's like

1147
01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.490
<v 1>it's human nature to want to know more.
Right?
Like we of course,</v>

1148
01:04:14.491 --> 01:04:18.480
like not everybody.
You see a draft,
you're like,
it's real.
I know it banked it.

1149
01:04:18.481 --> 01:04:21.300
Right.
Some people go to the extreme,
they study every aspect of it,

1150
01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:24.840
but as a general populous,
I feel like once we know something's there,

1151
01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:28.530
we want to know what the next thing is.
I mean we,
what do you think?
Like what?

1152
01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.250
Why?
Why is it that we're so fast?

1153
01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:31.590
<v 0>Same with,
I don't know the answer.</v>

1154
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:36.270
I think it's probably a side effect of our compulsion for innovation.

1155
01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:41.600
Like human beings are constantly trying to find out new secrets are and find
out,

1156
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:46.320
you know,
like find out new discoveries and invent new things and find,

1157
01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:47.610
explore new worlds.

1158
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:51.450
I mean this is just something that's been a part of human nature forever.

1159
01:04:51.451 --> 01:04:54.270
This desire to improve and to go for the fund,

1160
01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:57.390
the next best spot for the new thing,
you know?

1161
01:04:57.391 --> 01:04:59.910
And then I think that also works with animals.

1162
01:04:59.911 --> 01:05:03.930
I think we have this desire to find animals that we didn't know or he or weren't

1163
01:05:03.931 --> 01:05:06.660
sure real well knowledge is the foundation of that,
right?

1164
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.170
<v 1>To go to a new planet,
we have to have the knowledge of how to get there,</v>

1165
01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:12.750
to go to a new habitat.
We have to know what's there.

1166
01:05:12.751 --> 01:05:17.410
And I think maybe that's kind of that deep rooted desire is like we need know

1167
01:05:17.411 --> 01:05:17.980
about this

1168
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.210
<v 2>thing in order to,
to understand if we can innovate off of it.
Yeah,
maybe.</v>

1169
01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:25.300
Yeah.
Um,
what did you think when they found that?
Um,

1170
01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.890
Flores man on in Indonesia?
It's amazing.
I like,

1171
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:31.780
I'm not an anthropologist,
so you know,

1172
01:05:31.781 --> 01:05:35.320
that's not quite been 100% that is that 100% agreed upon.

1173
01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:38.950
I've only seen kind of headlines I,
I'd have to defer to you guys.

1174
01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.550
I think there was one,
there was some scientists that was disputing but,

1175
01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.040
but essentially they were talking about a three foot tall hobbit like man,
Yep.

1176
01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:49.590
Kind of cave dwelling.
Yeah,
yeah.
That little person,
yeah.

1177
01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:54.320
Existed alongside human beings as recently as like 14,000 years ago.
Right,
right.

1178
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:57.640
Which is like what I think it's completely believable.

1179
01:05:57.641 --> 01:06:02.070
I mean the Koi San People in the Sahara desert are tiny.
You know,
there,

1180
01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:06.700
there are big like four feet and until the,
you might have double check this,

1181
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:09.220
but I believe until the 70s people used to go and hunt them.

1182
01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:13.300
Maybe it was earlier we just sixties or fifties but you could go and hunt this

1183
01:06:13.301 --> 01:06:17.200
primitive sized human being as like a PA,
you know,
as like a hunt,

1184
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:20.980
like an old Englishman with his big mustache and his musket would go hunt these

1185
01:06:20.981 --> 01:06:23.890
people.
Whoa.
And now we have an understanding that,
you know,

1186
01:06:23.891 --> 01:06:28.510
there are people like you can't fucking go and hunt them.
But like what's to say?

1187
01:06:28.511 --> 01:06:31.780
There weren't tribes like that all over the world that other people used to hunt

1188
01:06:31.781 --> 01:06:36.670
that drove to extinction.
Jesus Christ.
Right.

1189
01:06:37.070 --> 01:06:40.890
What would say the name of it again?
So Jamie,
you got it.
You got Sun Koyczan?

1190
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:44.440
Yeah.
Let me see what these people look like.
They're,
in my opinion,

1191
01:06:44.441 --> 01:06:48.010
they're beautiful.
Like you'll see what you think.
But they're,
they're very small.

1192
01:06:48.011 --> 01:06:49.000
They're desert dwellers.
You know,

1193
01:06:49.001 --> 01:06:51.760
there's not a lot of resources in the dry desert,
so you don't get huge.

1194
01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:55.930
So they're perfectly adapted to the desert life.
They really used to hunt them.

1195
01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:59.620
Yeah.
And they look just like people.
I mean you'll have,

1196
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.650
but they're still around.
Like these aren't an extinct race.
There's still there.

1197
01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:09.130
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
You ever seen the gods must be crazy.
Yes.
Yeah.

1198
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:13.290
It's like those people,
those were kind of taller,
coy sand.
But those are Bushman.

1199
01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:18.550
Wow.
So who are these people that used to hunt these?

1200
01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:20.350
Like I say,
I kid you not.

1201
01:07:20.351 --> 01:07:24.040
It was like the old English explorer would go and conquer Africa and,

1202
01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:28.180
and hunt these people.
Like they were an animal,
you know,
fuck crazy.
Right.

1203
01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:32.170
And this was until the 1970s that might not be right.
That sounds too recent,

1204
01:07:32.171 --> 01:07:35.740
doesn't it?
God Damn,
that sounds horrific.
Yeah.
You might need to check that.

1205
01:07:35.741 --> 01:07:38.410
But it was not as long ago as you'd think.
You know what I mean?

1206
01:07:38.411 --> 01:07:42.220
It was like very recently,
they were still under under hunting.

1207
01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:47.140
Can they're people,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
So that,

1208
01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:52.200
that's probably what happened to a lot of the non homosapien human type people.

1209
01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:55.990
I would think so.
And even if it's not like for sport,

1210
01:07:55.991 --> 01:08:00.370
it's for competition or resources or you know what,
any reason,

1211
01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:04.330
and that's,
that's human nature.
Conquer.
Yeah.
Fuck man,

1212
01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:10.330
that is so dark.
Right.
They would go and hunt small people with a rifle.
Yup.

1213
01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:14.230
You know,
it's not there.
They're photos of people like posing with the dead ones.

1214
01:08:14.470 --> 01:08:16.340
Um,
again,
I'm not an anthropologist,

1215
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.780
<v 1>I'm not sure.
Yeah,
it's brutal.
Yeah.</v>

1216
01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:27.280
So what are the pockets of the world are like mostly unexplored or could perhaps

1217
01:08:27.621 --> 01:08:31.940
contained some of these animals?
South America for sure.
Central Africa for sure.

1218
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.570
There's some very remote parts of like Russian,
Arctic,
um,

1219
01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:40.940
Norwegian Arctic.
Um,
there's areas in Asia that are still unexplored,

1220
01:08:40.941 --> 01:08:44.450
believe it or not,
regardless of their populace,
there really are deep,
deep China.

1221
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:45.680
There are some very unexplored area,

1222
01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.700
a northern Myenmar ecological hotspot.

1223
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.100
Nobody goes there very impenetrable.

1224
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:55.790
I read something about sort of some part of the world where they thought Tara

1225
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:58.880
doctorals might still exist.
There's so many of those things.

1226
01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:01.910
I don't know that one specifically.
There's,
especially doing what I do,

1227
01:09:01.911 --> 01:09:04.600
I hear them all the time.
Right?
Oh,
you got to go look for a big foots.

1228
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.370
Are It actos or whatever?
Mamet's it's,

1229
01:09:08.390 --> 01:09:12.080
it could there be a large reptile that perhaps flies?
Sure.

1230
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:16.850
It's possible.
Is there a terror dactyl as we know it,
I highly,
highly doubt it,

1231
01:09:17.210 --> 01:09:20.930
but a large reptile that can fly it would be a fucking trip they were around.

1232
01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:24.530
Right.
So do you think it would be something that we don't know about?
Like,
yeah.

1233
01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.220
Basically,

1234
01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:29.090
I think there's enough pieces of this world that are unexplored that there are

1235
01:09:29.091 --> 01:09:32.810
still nega phonic to be discovered.
Not a lot.
Not a lot by any means.

1236
01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:36.140
And I might get ridiculed as I go back to my scientific community for saying

1237
01:09:36.141 --> 01:09:36.321
this,

1238
01:09:36.321 --> 01:09:41.000
but my belief is there are these isolated pockets where small populations of

1239
01:09:41.001 --> 01:09:45.380
Megafaun is still exist that we don't know about.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Well,

1240
01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:49.880
South America is,
I mean,
how much of South America is actually populated?

1241
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:54.260
I mean,
you look at the size of the Amazon jungle or something and it's,
it's the,

1242
01:09:54.261 --> 01:09:58.400
sure there's,
there's communities and stuff,
but not that much.
I mean it's there.

1243
01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:01.850
Australia,
you know,
if you're not on the coast,
there's nothing,
right?

1244
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.670
There's all these huge chunks.
Papa New Guinea,
same thing.

1245
01:10:04.671 --> 01:10:07.880
Nobody goes up into the highlands there.
They just found a dog there as you saw.

1246
01:10:07.881 --> 01:10:09.290
I mean,
there's crazy stuff.

1247
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:14.990
Now what do you think about these guys that are talking about bringing animals

1248
01:10:14.991 --> 01:10:18.970
back?
Um,
like as a scientist?
Sure.

1249
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:23.750
De Extinction is,
it's a weird word.
It is.
It is.
It's where your introduction,

1250
01:10:23.751 --> 01:10:25.520
is that a better word?
They call it the extinction.

1251
01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:26.720
So with that's what they call it.
Yeah.

1252
01:10:26.721 --> 01:10:30.800
De Extinction is to me it's fascinating,

1253
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:33.740
especially if it's something like say the passenger pigeon,
right?

1254
01:10:33.741 --> 01:10:38.210
We used to have billions of them and the United States wiped him out.
Um,

1255
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:43.340
and now they're saying,
you know,
we can take the closest living relative,
uh,

1256
01:10:43.370 --> 01:10:47.420
isolate some jeans and make a new passenger pigeon.
Is that worth it?

1257
01:10:47.421 --> 01:10:50.120
Cause it's something we wiped out in the last hundred years.
Yes.

1258
01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:54.590
I feel like that's,
we should heal the ecosystem by putting that back.
Right.

1259
01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.470
That being said,
we still need to learn from our mistakes.

1260
01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:01.970
Like we need to take into account what we did and why we did it and like do I

1261
01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:04.670
think there should be a Jurassic park and a bunch of mammoths and TRX is

1262
01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:07.790
absolutely not.
That's a waste whether we can or cannot do it.

1263
01:11:07.791 --> 01:11:11.690
To me that's a waste of scientific resources that could go towards conserving

1264
01:11:11.691 --> 01:11:12.830
things that are on the brink.

1265
01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:16.740
Now when you say like he'll or men,

1266
01:11:16.741 --> 01:11:19.980
the environment or the ecosystem when you would bring back something like a

1267
01:11:19.981 --> 01:11:24.720
passenger pigeon isn't like 90% of everything that ever existed extinct.
Sure,

1268
01:11:24.750 --> 01:11:25.291
absolutely.

1269
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:29.310
So does the ecosystem adjust and evolve and would reintroducing something like a

1270
01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:33.210
passenger pigeon would it kind of fucked things up that exists now where new

1271
01:11:33.211 --> 01:11:35.850
animals have taken a different position on the hierarchy?

1272
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:37.590
It's too short and evolutionary time.

1273
01:11:37.950 --> 01:11:41.640
So we are in what's called the sixth mass extinction event,
right?

1274
01:11:41.641 --> 01:11:44.340
There's been five others before us.
The one we're in now,

1275
01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.820
it's happening at 80% greater rate than it's ever happened before.

1276
01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:52.530
So we are wiping out things more quickly than the world can adapt.

1277
01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:57.000
So you know,
you go into an environment and you take out all the apex predators,

1278
01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:01.050
the prey explodes,
the prey explodes,
the grass gets eaten down,

1279
01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:04.440
everything collapses.
Now if you left that environment over time,

1280
01:12:04.441 --> 01:12:08.580
over evolutionary time,
it would adapt,
right?
Maybe say,

1281
01:12:08.581 --> 01:12:12.180
say all of the predators got a disease and they died,

1282
01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.660
died out over 300 generations during that time,

1283
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:19.500
something would evolve within the environment to adapt.

1284
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:22.080
The prey so that it didn't wipe out the environment.

1285
01:12:22.081 --> 01:12:23.620
That's just kind of the nature,
it's balance.

1286
01:12:23.621 --> 01:12:26.550
But when you go in there and do it in 10 years or five years,

1287
01:12:26.790 --> 01:12:30.420
it throws off the equilibrium.
So when you,
in theory,

1288
01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:33.480
when you reintroduce something that's been,
and it's not theory,
it's,

1289
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:34.081
it's science,

1290
01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:36.660
they've shown this even right here in the California Channel Islands,

1291
01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.600
when you put something back that's missing from the ecosystem,

1292
01:12:39.601 --> 01:12:42.060
it's like you're putting a piece of the puzzle back,
right?

1293
01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:45.090
And then you can allow it to do its thing over evolutionary time.

1294
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:46.860
What did they do in the channel islands?

1295
01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:50.280
So I was actually a big part of that and I loved,
loved the project.

1296
01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:53.670
So the California channel islands were settled by agriculture.
There were sheeps,

1297
01:12:53.671 --> 01:12:56.070
goats,
pigs,
blah,
blah,
blah.
There was everything brought over there.
Right?

1298
01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:59.940
And so not Catalina,
but think about the northern channel islands.
Um,

1299
01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.010
what happened was when all these animals were brought in,

1300
01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:05.310
all the farmers were there.
Then Golden Eagle started coming over.

1301
01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:08.890
Golden Eagles came over to eat the pigs and everything else.
Oh,

1302
01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:11.220
flew across the ocean.
Yup.
Flew across the channel,

1303
01:13:11.221 --> 01:13:12.780
started praying on pigs and everything else.

1304
01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:15.990
There was an animal on the channel islands called the Channel Island Fox.

1305
01:13:16.050 --> 01:13:19.020
Very gorgeous,
cute,
cuddly little Fox.
Um,

1306
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:21.420
you can see them if you go to Santa Cruz island,
there's loads of them now,

1307
01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:25.200
thanks to the work that scientists have done.
Anyway,
they were like,
okay,

1308
01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.060
the Fox is being there.
It is,
isn't it?
Gorgeous?
Little cute things.

1309
01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.540
So the Fox is being wiped out through habitat destruction through all these

1310
01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:37.400
undulates that had been brought in.
So scientists got together and said,
Angela,

1311
01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:41.010
it's like cows or,
yeah,
yeah.
Domestic animals,
cows,
sheep,
goats,
et cetera.

1312
01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:44.490
So scientists came in and said,
you know,
the habitats getting destroyed,

1313
01:13:44.491 --> 01:13:46.200
the and that.
That's just the keystone.

1314
01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:49.590
There were several species that were on the decline.
The cows are getting,

1315
01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:54.120
the livestock is wiping out the habitat.
The foxes are declining.

1316
01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:57.330
What do we do?
Well,
obvious answer.
Let's remove all the livestock.

1317
01:13:57.331 --> 01:13:59.940
So we removed all the livestock,
right through helicopters.

1318
01:13:59.941 --> 01:14:02.340
It was a lot of pigs that were causing damage,
all that kind of stuff.

1319
01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:03.174
We were moved at all.

1320
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.750
Then the Golden Eagle started praying on the foxes because their main habitat

1321
01:14:06.751 --> 01:14:09.150
was gone.
So now the foxes are under even more pressure.

1322
01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:12.010
So then we moved the Golden Eagles.
This is a very abridged

1323
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:12.910
<v 2>version of what happened,</v>

1324
01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:16.960
but now we've got the Golden Eagles also pushed out the Bald Eagle,

1325
01:14:16.961 --> 01:14:18.460
which are fish eaters,
which lived on the island.

1326
01:14:18.670 --> 01:14:22.360
So now after loads of years of removing golden eagles,
like relocating them,

1327
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:23.830
removing all of the livestock,

1328
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:26.410
now you have a healthy population of channel island foxes.

1329
01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:28.120
The Bald Eagles are back there eating fish.

1330
01:14:28.121 --> 01:14:31.840
The whole ecosystem is back in balance.
Had it been left the way it was,

1331
01:14:32.110 --> 01:14:35.350
what you would have found at the California Channel Islands over say 20 or 30

1332
01:14:35.351 --> 01:14:39.100
more years,
40 or 50 more years?
No foxes,
no,
no bald eagles,

1333
01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.170
a ton of Golden Eagles and a ton of pigs.

1334
01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.290
And likely over time pigs would have exploded to the point that they Easter

1335
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:47.610
island to themselves,
right?
They ate up,
all the resources destroyed,

1336
01:14:47.611 --> 01:14:50.710
all the habitat.
Population collapsed.
Golden Eagles collapse.

1337
01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:53.200
Nothing left on the outlet.
Do you mean by Easter island themselves?

1338
01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:55.450
So you're familiar with Easter Island and South America.

1339
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.760
I know what those statues are and all that stuff,

1340
01:14:57.761 --> 01:15:01.900
but I'm not familiar with what happened to Sean.
So that island is,

1341
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:05.620
was an ancient civilization.
That was the Mech.
It had everything offline.

1342
01:15:05.621 --> 01:15:07.930
It had big trees,
tons of food,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1343
01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:12.030
People settled there and they said,
this place is incredible.
It's,

1344
01:15:12.031 --> 01:15:16.510
it's paradoxical.
Um,
and then they started cutting down the trees to fish.

1345
01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:17.980
They started eating all the mammals.

1346
01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.650
And what actually happened is because there were so remote,

1347
01:15:20.651 --> 01:15:23.440
the middle of the ocean,
nowhere near South America,
nowhere near anywhere else,

1348
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:26.680
they cut down the last tree.
There were no more canoes,

1349
01:15:26.770 --> 01:15:29.410
there was no more food on the island.
And the population collapsed.

1350
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:33.430
The island was barren.
It was void of trees,
void of life,
void of anything.

1351
01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:36.460
And they didn't have the canoes or anything to leave anymore because they cut

1352
01:15:36.461 --> 01:15:39.160
down the last tree to build,
build a boat,
or make firewood,

1353
01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:42.760
and everybody there died.
Oh Shit.
So that,

1354
01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:47.710
that's what happens when you use up every last resource.
God.
So,

1355
01:15:49.030 --> 01:15:51.730
wow,
when did this happen?
Uh,
I couldn't,

1356
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:55.030
couldn't tell you cause I thought it was like a mystery to like what happened to

1357
01:15:55.031 --> 01:15:57.640
the population of Easter islands.
So they,
they're pretty,
that's yours.

1358
01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:00.570
That's the accepted,
that's the scientifically accepted understanding.

1359
01:16:00.571 --> 01:16:02.140
And did they get this from fossils?

1360
01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:06.330
They get this from bones and as that they've sort of pieced it together.

1361
01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:07.630
They took,
they take,
you know,

1362
01:16:07.631 --> 01:16:11.230
isotopes samples and measure carbon dating and Yadda Yadda.

1363
01:16:11.231 --> 01:16:15.670
I think that the heads are still a pretty big mystery why I think certain people

1364
01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:18.670
believe that the heads were like,
uh,
an Ale,
you know,

1365
01:16:18.671 --> 01:16:21.790
calling to the gods to help save things cause they were going so badly,

1366
01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:24.670
Yada Yada.
But I believe the heads are still a pretty big mystery.

1367
01:16:24.671 --> 01:16:27.700
But the actual anthropology,
the population,
the collapse is,

1368
01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:32.200
is known to be due to a running out of resources.
How long did it go for?

1369
01:16:32.530 --> 01:16:36.220
Couldn't tell you that they have an idea of how long the population lasted.

1370
01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.350
I think it's all,
I think it's all published.
Yeah.

1371
01:16:38.351 --> 01:16:40.480
I don't know off the top of my head,
but it was,

1372
01:16:40.481 --> 01:16:44.800
it was a thriving population that flew too close to the sun,
as they say,

1373
01:16:45.850 --> 01:16:48.850
because of Easter,
around small size and only 63 square miles,

1374
01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:52.210
it quickly became over populated.
It's resources.
We're rapidly depleted.

1375
01:16:52.211 --> 01:16:55.900
When Europeans arrived in Easter island between the late 17 hundreds in the

1376
01:16:55.901 --> 01:17:00.890
early 18 hundreds it was reported that the Moai were knocked down and the island

1377
01:17:00.891 --> 01:17:02.080
seem to,
did I say that right?

1378
01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:07.140
My why knocked down and the island seem to have been a recent war site.

1379
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:13.220
<v 0>Hmm.
Laughs.
Yeah.
Let's see.
The next one there.</v>

1380
01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:16.940
Constant warfare between the tribes,
lack of surprise,
plies and resources,

1381
01:17:16.941 --> 01:17:17.774
disease,

1382
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:22.840
invasive species and the opening of the island to foreign slave trade eventually

1383
01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:26.840
led to Easter island's collapsed by the 1860s wow.

1384
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:31.790
So it didn't take long.
1700 to 1860s that was a wrap.
Wow.

1385
01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.410
It was annexed by Chile and so they've never tried to repopulate the island with

1386
01:17:36.411 --> 01:17:38.810
trees or anything else and they're just kind of leave it alone.

1387
01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:41.620
<v 1>I believe so.
I know you can go there and visit it and see the heads.</v>

1388
01:17:41.621 --> 01:17:44.500
And I think there are some things there now,
but it's,
it's barren.

1389
01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:47.470
There are no trees.
There's no,
you know,
it's all been depleted.

1390
01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:51.770
<v 0>It's so crazy when they introduce animals to an island and it winds up fucking</v>

1391
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:54.050
everything up like Galapagos island,
you know,

1392
01:17:54.051 --> 01:17:58.280
and I'm sure you're familiar with the,
um,
Judas,
Judas goats,

1393
01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:00.200
Judas goats are,
those are the ones in the Galapagos.

1394
01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:02.780
Do you know how they do that?
I don't harass me.
Kate goats.

1395
01:18:02.810 --> 01:18:05.240
It's really interesting.
Not from the helicopters.
Yeah.

1396
01:18:05.241 --> 01:18:08.270
Well this is how they do it.
They cast goats,
like to hang out together.
Right.

1397
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:12.290
But sometimes it's hard to locate them.
So they put a radio collar on one goat,

1398
01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:16.130
they castrate it and then they let it loose and they gunned down all the goats

1399
01:18:16.131 --> 01:18:19.050
around it and let that go.
Go find the rest of the goats.

1400
01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:20.720
He goes and finds the rest of it goes.

1401
01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:24.620
Then they gun down those goats because they have the radio collar.
Yeah.
So these,

1402
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:28.970
what does this Jamie picture of a Judas Code?
I guess he's just whites go,

1403
01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:34.010
hey,
maybe there's a couple other pictures.
How sad is that?

1404
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:37.970
Single goat's life.
He's like new friends.
What the fuck?
Helicopters.

1405
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:42.740
So I'm actually heading there on a Monday.
It goes.
Yeah.

1406
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:44.150
They make you take your shoes off,
right.

1407
01:18:44.151 --> 01:18:46.760
And scrubbed to make sure that you don't have weird seeds and the bottom where

1408
01:18:46.761 --> 01:18:47.560
your shoes

1409
01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.110
<v 1>to stop eating seeds.
Quarantine for 48 hours when we arrived.
I'm eating.
Yeah.</v>

1410
01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:56.050
<v 0>So you don't shit it out.
Exactly.
Quarantine for 48 hours.
Yup.</v>

1411
01:18:56.610 --> 01:19:00.600
Wow.
Why,
why is there so much concern about this one area?

1412
01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.690
<v 1>Uh,
I mean it's the dawn of evolution.
You know,</v>

1413
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:07.050
it's where Darwin came up with a theory of evolution and due to the finches,

1414
01:19:07.051 --> 01:19:11.730
it's,
it has been destroyed in some aspects and it's been a,

1415
01:19:11.731 --> 01:19:14.010
the habitat has been fixed in a lot of places.

1416
01:19:14.011 --> 01:19:17.760
There's been great conservation efforts and personally I love what they're doing

1417
01:19:17.761 --> 01:19:19.750
because they're trying to keep it pristine.
You know,

1418
01:19:19.770 --> 01:19:21.670
I think it's fantastic that there's a quarantine.

1419
01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:24.450
I think it's great that I'm not supposed to eat seeds for two weeks before going

1420
01:19:24.451 --> 01:19:28.380
there.
Um,
and it's,
it's to keep it as perfect as it is now.

1421
01:19:28.381 --> 01:19:29.990
The island that I'm going to with,

1422
01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:33.630
with my small team has like nobody ever stepped foot on it.

1423
01:19:33.631 --> 01:19:37.650
It's an active volcano erupts every year.
It's this crazy harsh environment.

1424
01:19:37.651 --> 01:19:40.100
We have to have a new pair of boots every day cause it melts,

1425
01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:42.150
melts and treads your boots,
just walking on it.

1426
01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.170
It's been described as hell on earth.
So I'm stoked.
Wow.

1427
01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:49.170
And then what kind of protective gear do you have to wear other than your boots?

1428
01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:51.960
Just long sleeved clothing.
I mean,
is it yet,
it's,

1429
01:19:51.961 --> 01:19:55.170
so the guy was telling me it's like 45 degrees Celsius,
so that's,

1430
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:59.790
it's well over a hundred.
Um,
and yeah,
and that's,
you know,

1431
01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:02.520
we've gotta be careful about water and hiking and there's just,

1432
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:05.070
there's a lot of elements,
but that's the thing is I'm looking for an animal.

1433
01:20:05.071 --> 01:20:08.070
Nobody's seen and a very long amount time.
So you've got to go to these

1434
01:20:08.070 --> 01:20:12.510
<v 2>places.
Nobody's going.
Wow,
that's incredible.
You know,
it's,</v>

1435
01:20:12.511 --> 01:20:15.750
it's interesting the idea of invasive species too,
right?

1436
01:20:15.751 --> 01:20:18.960
Because like Hawaii's a good example,
Hawaii,

1437
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:23.610
there's been talk of getting rid of pigs.
Yup.
And a lot of the natives are like,

1438
01:20:23.611 --> 01:20:27.510
well slow down because if they're what we hunt them,
we eat them.

1439
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:29.980
And if they're invasive than what are we right.

1440
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:33.000
Totally is the pigs were here right around the same time that people were there

1441
01:20:33.001 --> 01:20:35.370
and they've,
we've existed together.

1442
01:20:35.930 --> 01:20:39.420
They need each other and its culture.
You know at that point it's,

1443
01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.440
it's Polynesian culture to eat a fire roasted pig and hunt your pig.

1444
01:20:43.441 --> 01:20:46.710
And so it's a delicate balance.
Like Hawaii is a perfect example.

1445
01:20:46.711 --> 01:20:50.120
There's Mongie so were introduced that destroyed the birds.
And uh,

1446
01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:51.210
there's turtles,
there's frogs,

1447
01:20:51.211 --> 01:20:53.040
there's all kinds of things that have been brought in there,

1448
01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.760
but none of those are culturally significant.
Whereas the pig,

1449
01:20:56.761 --> 01:21:00.660
as you're saying is a huge cultural significance.
So where is the balance?

1450
01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:04.530
Well one of the best examples of that would be like Lanai.

1451
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.960
Cause Lanai has this insane population have access to here and we,

1452
01:21:08.090 --> 01:21:12.120
we go and bow hunt them there every year.
They're delicious,
they're plentiful.

1453
01:21:12.121 --> 01:21:16.100
And it's one of the most really ethical hunts cause you have to hunt them right

1454
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:21.060
there.
So overpopulated,
there's 20,000 of them on an island with 300 people.
Yep.

1455
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:24.760
And have you ever been till the night?
I have,
yeah.
I was diving there.

1456
01:21:24.761 --> 01:21:27.370
A spear fishing there.
Do you see all the stacks?
Tears everywhere.

1457
01:21:27.610 --> 01:21:31.260
Every man is great and they're so beautiful.
Their spots and yeah,

1458
01:21:31.261 --> 01:21:33.510
they're amazing animals.
And you know,
I'm all for it.

1459
01:21:33.511 --> 01:21:36.740
Like hunting as a tool for conservation.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

1460
01:21:36.750 --> 01:21:39.240
But it's just bizarre that they did that.

1461
01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:43.080
They did decide to let dear loose and an island with nothing to eat the deer,

1462
01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:46.920
but people.
Right.
And then when this was done,
there's like King Kamehameha,

1463
01:21:46.921 --> 01:21:51.180
which is,
what year was that?
I couldn't say a long time ago.
Yeah,
long time ago.

1464
01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:54.510
So back then they,
I mean,
I don't even know if they had guns.
I mean,

1465
01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:55.860
how were they hunting these things back then?

1466
01:21:55.910 --> 01:22:00.910
Bose and spears and they brought him over from Asia,

1467
01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:04.530
right?
Yup,
Yup.
They're from Asia.
Same thing with New Zealand,
right?

1468
01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:05.970
There's access steer,
there's goats,

1469
01:22:05.971 --> 01:22:08.370
there's all kinds of things are not access but red deer,

1470
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:11.160
there's all kinds of things down there and same thing.

1471
01:22:11.161 --> 01:22:14.250
There are all brought in for sport.
Yeah,
New Zealand's a weird one,
right?

1472
01:22:14.251 --> 01:22:17.340
So it was Australia.
They brought a lot of stuff over there from,
from Europe.

1473
01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:19.140
But New Zealand specifically,

1474
01:22:19.141 --> 01:22:21.390
they were trying to make it like a hunter's paradise.
Right.

1475
01:22:21.391 --> 01:22:23.930
And I think it is right.
Tell me if I'm wrong.
No it is,
but it's,

1476
01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:27.810
it's a weird one because it's mostly high fence.
You're going to love this.

1477
01:22:27.811 --> 01:22:32.070
So under my extinct animal thing,
they've took moose into New Zealand.

1478
01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:35.970
They took like 10 of them.
Small population believe that they've been hunted out.

1479
01:22:35.971 --> 01:22:39.450
You know,
they shot the last wine,
blah blah blah blah.
There's one guy,

1480
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.390
crazy looking dude,
long hair,
long beard,
like nuts looking guy.

1481
01:22:42.391 --> 01:22:44.250
And he's been on the hunt,
not hunt,
hunt,

1482
01:22:44.251 --> 01:22:47.040
but like trying to prove that the New Zealand Moose is still there.

1483
01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:49.890
He's found antler sheds,
he's found betting sites.

1484
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:53.910
Some guy even got a picture of one standing on a rock and you know Moose to me

1485
01:22:53.911 --> 01:22:58.110
it's 100% and Moose and so they're in theory somewhere down in the South Island.

1486
01:22:58.260 --> 01:23:02.580
There's one or two or three of these super elusive Mousse that had been in New

1487
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:06.520
Zealand for like 50 years.
Whoa.
Wow.
Well New Zealand

1488
01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.760
<v 0>is so fucking rugged.
Yeah,
there's a,</v>

1489
01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:13.450
a friend of mine has been there,
a my friend Anne Green tree,
he's been there,

1490
01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:17.480
he lives in Australia and he goes there to hunt tar and you know they live in

1491
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.560
the on the steep steep craggy [inaudible] shale where the rock's real slippery

1492
01:23:24.011 --> 01:23:27.340
and it's just like cold.
That shit.
Really high altitude.

1493
01:23:27.341 --> 01:23:30.800
And you've seen them before,
right?
Yeah.
It looks like a science fiction animal.

1494
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:33.070
<v 1>They're as,
as me and my friend Mike,</v>

1495
01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.660
me and the guys I work with like to say stranger than fiction.

1496
01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:37.940
You look at it and you're like,
that's not a real creature.

1497
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:39.550
Like some kid drew that.
Yeah.

1498
01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:44.810
Like a big old shaggy weird looking thing where they think they are in New

1499
01:23:44.810 --> 01:23:45.800
Zealand.
The Mousse.
Yeah.

1500
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:48.860
Did you see that picture of the one on the rock sticking out?

1501
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:55.730
Yeah,
that's the last one that was taped.
Last picture taken.

1502
01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.810
1952 there's a recent one though.
There's one from like two or three years ago,

1503
01:23:59.811 --> 01:24:01.790
and I looked at it.
I'm like,
that's the most like,

1504
01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:03.470
I don't know who's saying it's not,
but it's a motion.

1505
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.540
<v 0>Wow.
Yeah.
From 1952 hmm.
Yeah.</v>

1506
01:24:08.541 --> 01:24:11.370
That's 100% of Moose.
Right?
Again,

1507
01:24:11.490 --> 01:24:14.520
how weird is it that there's animals that you know are there and then there's

1508
01:24:14.521 --> 01:24:14.791
animals?

1509
01:24:14.791 --> 01:24:18.600
Like we must find that they spend incredible amounts of time and all these

1510
01:24:18.601 --> 01:24:22.510
resources.
Is that it?
That's all.
Yeah.
That's 100% of that's fricking moves.

1511
01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:27.380
No doubt about it.
So what I'm saying,
God,

1512
01:24:27.570 --> 01:24:31.080
people.
Yeah.
That doesn't even make sense that anybody would argue that.
Right?

1513
01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:32.010
That's a pretty clear picture.

1514
01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.690
But that's not proof because they need genetic material.
They need further,

1515
01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:39.660
they need something.
What do they think that is?
A cloud.
Exactly.
Oh,
rubber Moose.

1516
01:24:39.661 --> 01:24:41.450
That someone's stuck there in it too.
Goofy

1517
01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:42.061
<v 1>people are,</v>

1518
01:24:42.061 --> 01:24:45.420
they like arguing that somebody could have computer generated it to fool people

1519
01:24:45.421 --> 01:24:48.600
and all those,
all those.
And I appreciate it.
Right.
As a scientist,

1520
01:24:48.601 --> 01:24:51.690
I appreciate the fact that you have to have proof,

1521
01:24:52.110 --> 01:24:54.420
but it does get to the point of ridiculousness.

1522
01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.830
<v 0>Yeah.
Well it's certainly possible.
It's certainly possible that they've,
I mean,</v>

1523
01:24:57.831 --> 01:25:02.210
especially when you're looking at that insanely dense terrain.
Right?
Right.

1524
01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:07.690
But so there are some efforts right now to try to de extinct some animals there

1525
01:25:09.531 --> 01:25:13.840
are,
thank you.
New Word and a w like what is,

1526
01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:15.410
what is currently going on right now?

1527
01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.800
<v 1>They're calling it the dawn of de extinction and it's,
um,</v>

1528
01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.190
it's a lot of very,

1529
01:25:22.191 --> 01:25:27.191
very intelligent genetic scientists that are trying to isolate specific genes

1530
01:25:28.550 --> 01:25:33.320
that are specific to the animals that have been extinct and putting them into

1531
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:34.310
extent animals,

1532
01:25:34.311 --> 01:25:38.630
animals that are still here to basically make this Frankenstein animal.

1533
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:40.790
Cause it'll never be the animal that's gone.
Right.

1534
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:44.390
It will look like it'll behave like it,
it'll think like it,
et cetera.

1535
01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:47.960
But it will never actually be the animal that we've lost.
At least not yet.

1536
01:25:47.961 --> 01:25:49.880
We haven't,
we don't have that technology right now.

1537
01:25:49.881 --> 01:25:51.410
What we can do is isolated genome,

1538
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:55.520
put it into an existing animal that gives birth to an animal that looks and acts

1539
01:25:55.521 --> 01:25:56.780
very much like the extinct,

1540
01:25:56.980 --> 01:26:01.780
<v 0>but it's some degree different because it's like part like of a mammoth.</v>

1541
01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:04.400
For instance,
they would have to take some DNA

1542
01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.570
<v 2>from a mammoth,
right?</v>

1543
01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:09.790
That they would somehow or another get and introduce it to an embryo,

1544
01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:13.880
but how much of an elephant and the elephant would give birth to a very hairy,

1545
01:26:13.881 --> 01:26:18.860
very large task,
like these isolated genetic codes,
elephant.

1546
01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:21.440
And it would look like a mammoth.
It would act like a mammoth.

1547
01:26:21.441 --> 01:26:24.950
But the reality is it's a shaggy elephant with big tusks.
Right?

1548
01:26:24.951 --> 01:26:27.180
So if you did like 23 and me on it,

1549
01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.900
it would show what's mostly Elif.
Exactly.
It's a little bit of a mammoth.
Yeah.

1550
01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:36.320
I mean,
if you think of a double helix,
like a a DNA strand,
right?

1551
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:39.350
You have these little bars in the middle of it.
So what they do is,

1552
01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:41.180
this is a very crude way to explain it,

1553
01:26:41.181 --> 01:26:45.450
but they pull out a bar from an elephant and they put in a bar from um,

1554
01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:48.290
a mammoth and then eventually you get this mammoth.

1555
01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:51.980
And so this would be like gene editing tools like crisper.
Exactly.

1556
01:26:52.050 --> 01:26:56.660
On those lines.
Exactly.
Wow.
And so how far away are they from doing this?

1557
01:26:56.990 --> 01:27:00.500
Uh,
it's,
I mean it's been successfully done a couple of times.
They've really,

1558
01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:03.620
they've given birth to a couple of animals that are very,

1559
01:27:03.621 --> 01:27:07.340
very close to the extinct animal.
Most of the time there's problems,
right?

1560
01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:12.290
There's,
it's in fertile,
it's a,
it has lung issues,
whatever it is.

1561
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:15.740
There's a couple different cases.
I'm not a geneticist,
I'm a wildlife biologist,

1562
01:27:15.741 --> 01:27:18.920
so I don't really understand it,
but it's,
they've done it.

1563
01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:21.950
They have successfully reproduce things that are gone,

1564
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:26.150
basically clone things and then the animal hasn't made it to adulthood.

1565
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:30.130
And that seems really,
really like playing.
God does.
It is,

1566
01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:33.680
it is absolutely like playing God.
I feel like,

1567
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.370
I mean is are people doing it just cause they can,

1568
01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.280
is it one of those things or zero,

1569
01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:44.300
like a real valid scientific reason for trying to reintroduce these animals are

1570
01:27:44.490 --> 01:27:48.890
extinct them?
Well,
the,
the valid reason is to conserve the ecosystem,
right?

1571
01:27:48.891 --> 01:27:49.730
Like we talked about,

1572
01:27:49.731 --> 01:27:53.930
but I think it goes back to what we were saying half an hour ago,
which is,

1573
01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:58.040
it's just that,
that quest for knowledge that can we do it,
the innovation,
right?

1574
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:02.660
Can we play God,
can we fix it?
Can we take this thing that's gone and say no,

1575
01:28:02.661 --> 01:28:06.960
it's not like we have the tools to make it not gone.
Yeah.
There was,
um,

1576
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:11.210
some article that I read where they were talking about reintroducing the mammoth

1577
01:28:11.211 --> 01:28:16.211
to Siberia and that there would be some ecological benefit to reintroducing the

1578
01:28:16.641 --> 01:28:19.040
mammoth because of the way they forage for foods.
Sure.

1579
01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:23.210
They would have some sort of an effect on global warming.
Sure.
I mean,

1580
01:28:23.211 --> 01:28:25.660
do you know about that?
I don't know about that specifically.

1581
01:28:25.661 --> 01:28:26.494
You could find that Jamie,

1582
01:28:26.770 --> 01:28:30.800
the reintroducing the mammoth to Siberia to benefit the environment.

1583
01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:35.720
Look,
whether that's accurate or not until you put Mamet's on the ground,

1584
01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:39.380
how do we actually know it's a great theory and that's what science is,
right?

1585
01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:43.340
It's coming up with hypothesis and then trying to prove them and it sounds cool.

1586
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:46.400
Like,
do I want to see a mammoth walking around Siberia?
Fuck yeah,

1587
01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:50.060
but does that mean it's actually good for the world?
Hard to say.
Whoa.

1588
01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:52.820
Could bringing back mammas help stop climate change?

1589
01:28:52.821 --> 01:28:56.630
Scientists say creating hybrids of extinct beasts could fix the Arctic Tundra

1590
01:28:56.990 --> 01:29:00.620
and stop greenhouse gas emissions.
I don't understand that.

1591
01:29:00.650 --> 01:29:02.340
I find it hard to believe,
to be honest.

1592
01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:06.210
<v 0>Maybe it's just some scientists clever way of sneaking it in because he wants to</v>

1593
01:29:06.211 --> 01:29:10.560
play God like,
Hey,
we're going to fix everything.
Yeah,
you fucking use coal.

1594
01:29:10.561 --> 01:29:13.080
Who gives a shit?
We got a hammock.
We got Matt.

1595
01:29:13.240 --> 01:29:16.610
Just give me the funding can be clean.
That's,

1596
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:21.420
that's sadly very real.
Well,
is it really?
Oh yeah.
I mean,
look,

1597
01:29:21.421 --> 01:29:25.380
if you're a scientist,
right?
Right.
You,
Joe Rogan is a scientist.

1598
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:26.700
How are you going to make your career?

1599
01:29:26.701 --> 01:29:29.880
Are you going to make your career by raising money through being like,
yeah,
sure.

1600
01:29:29.881 --> 01:29:32.730
Like I'll study cricket legs or you're going to be like,
look,

1601
01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:36.960
give me the money to stop global warming by bringing back fucking Mamis like,

1602
01:29:36.961 --> 01:29:37.531
right.
You know,

1603
01:29:37.531 --> 01:29:41.610
like why you can make the outrageous claim if you think it's going to fund your

1604
01:29:41.611 --> 01:29:44.960
research.
Right.
That's how you make your bones.
Right.
And that's,

1605
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:47.340
that's one of the sad realities of some,

1606
01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:51.900
certainly not all science well mammoths to are so iconic.

1607
01:29:51.901 --> 01:29:55.680
It's such a freaky animal to study.
You know,
we had him here.

1608
01:29:55.810 --> 01:30:00.180
California Channel Islands.
Yeah.
Take me down.
It's,
yeah.
How long ago was that?

1609
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:03.900
Uh,
want to say pre ice age?
Not Actually.
Sure,

1610
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:06.990
but I mean still,
can you imagine like,
you know,

1611
01:30:06.991 --> 01:30:09.630
you're out fishing at Catalina and you look up and there's a pygmy mammoth on

1612
01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:11.190
the cliff.
There's a,

1613
01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:16.050
there's so many mammoth tusks in Alaska in particular.
There's a,
there's a,

1614
01:30:16.051 --> 01:30:20.040
an Instagram page.
We can,
I'll just send it to you day Jamie.
Um,

1615
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:25.070
there's a a page where they go and look for them and uh,

1616
01:30:25.591 --> 01:30:26.280
they,
they,

1617
01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:31.090
they basically use like a high pressure hose and blow them out of a,

1618
01:30:31.091 --> 01:30:35.580
the side of a hill.
Is it like an ice or is it in like earth?
Uh,

1619
01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:40.260
it's an earth,
Huh?
Yeah.
Okay.
The bone yard,
Alaska is a,

1620
01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:43.470
the Instagram page.
If you go to the bone yard,
Alaska,

1621
01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:47.130
you'll see what I'm talking about.
It's fucking incredible.
I mean,

1622
01:30:47.131 --> 01:30:48.120
they keep pulling these,

1623
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:51.900
they're using these hoses and cleaning off this dirt and they're pulling these

1624
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.030
intact tusks.
That's insane.

1625
01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.310
But it must have been so many of them that died and they were pre,
I mean,

1626
01:30:57.320 --> 01:31:00.600
whether it's mudslides or whatever and they get preserved under these things.

1627
01:31:00.601 --> 01:31:03.630
There's this one pocket where they're all concentrated will there apparently

1628
01:31:03.631 --> 01:31:07.860
they find quite a bit of him.
That's not one of those in the uh,
in the studio.

1629
01:31:07.861 --> 01:31:10.530
Mammoth Tusk.
Yeah,
man.
Yeah,
I guess,

1630
01:31:10.531 --> 01:31:15.270
but it seems like he shouldn't have it seems like.
Yeah.

1631
01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:17.610
But you don't want it at some rich assholes house.
Totally.

1632
01:31:17.640 --> 01:31:21.360
What does that scar was?
Skull.
Oh,
short face.

1633
01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.800
Bear skull whole fuck man.
That's a cool animal.
That's a cool animal.
Yeah.

1634
01:31:25.801 --> 01:31:29.700
We've uh,
we've drooled over those fucking things many times on the podcast.

1635
01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:33.920
See you right there.
You see those tusks?
Those are tons of laughter.
Yeah.
Bottom.

1636
01:31:33.930 --> 01:31:37.940
That right there.
Those are some tests that they pulled out.
That's nuts.
Yeah.

1637
01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.780
There's a ton of a man.
I mean these guys,

1638
01:31:40.110 --> 01:31:43.530
these guys are constantly doing this and,
and pulling these things out.

1639
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:46.050
So let me ask you,
you're,
you're hiking through there,
right?
You're a,

1640
01:31:46.060 --> 01:31:49.440
you're on a hike or a hunt or whatever.
You stub your toe on one.
What do you do?

1641
01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:52.890
You dig it out and put it on your pack and you leave it.
Take a picture.

1642
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.660
What do you do?
I don't know what the rules are.
Look,

1643
01:31:54.661 --> 01:31:58.110
if you're in certain places and you find an arrowhead,

1644
01:31:58.111 --> 01:32:00.040
you're supposed to leave it.
But rules aside,

1645
01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.850
<v 2>like ethically,
what do you do?
Well,</v>

1646
01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:07.350
it depends on how far away you are,
right?
Because that's a lot of weight.
So that,

1647
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:08.650
that's,
that's fair.
That's fair.

1648
01:32:08.651 --> 01:32:13.180
I would say you market a market pin on a gps and come back cause it's like it's

1649
01:32:13.181 --> 01:32:15.550
something you want right as a human being.
It's a treasure.

1650
01:32:15.551 --> 01:32:17.170
Like you found this incredible thing,

1651
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:21.040
but ethically you should probably shouldn't touch it.
You know,
what do you do?

1652
01:32:21.130 --> 01:32:23.020
Well these guys obviously know what they're doing.
Right.

1653
01:32:23.021 --> 01:32:27.460
For me I would s I mean if look at that one.
Oh my God,

1654
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:31.390
that's crazy.
It is huge.
Wrap it up with tape.

1655
01:32:31.391 --> 01:32:33.440
Is that what they did there to like it looks like all those,

1656
01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:35.990
those metal together sort of,

1657
01:32:36.230 --> 01:32:39.220
I like to keep it from falling apart maybe as they pull it out of the water or

1658
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:44.050
the dirt rather.
Um,
if I was thinking of my best me,

1659
01:32:44.470 --> 01:32:48.160
the best meat would mark a pen and then alerts,

1660
01:32:48.170 --> 01:32:50.970
tell someone and tell them where it is and leave it the fuck alone.

1661
01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:55.360
Don't be greedy Dick.
So what happens in our lovers,
I dig that bitch out,

1662
01:32:55.630 --> 01:32:58.540
put it on my pack and not tell anybody and bring it back home.

1663
01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:02.290
I just don't know what the law is.
Sure.
And even beyond the law.

1664
01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:04.780
Like here's this gentleman right here is pulling this out.

1665
01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:09.340
Even if you don't know what the law is,
what's what's right.
That's the question.

1666
01:33:09.370 --> 01:33:13.480
Yeah,
what's right,
what's the right thing to do?
They might not be a good law yet,

1667
01:33:13.780 --> 01:33:17.320
but there might be,
I mean,
there clearly as a finite number of these things.

1668
01:33:17.321 --> 01:33:20.920
Of course there has to be,
and they're prehistoric.
Now,
let me,

1669
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:24.160
let me pose this to you.
So I know a guy,
he's treasure hunter by trade.

1670
01:33:24.190 --> 01:33:28.600
Very cool old guy,
Australian guy,
lived in Perth and uh,
for years he's like,

1671
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:32.290
I know where the certain Spanish ship went down.
Long story short,

1672
01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:36.400
he finds it right,
digs up one single gold coin and he's like,
it's here.

1673
01:33:36.401 --> 01:33:39.550
I know it's here.
It's big spear fishermen.
Adventure guy goes,

1674
01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:41.770
spends tens of thousands of dollars,
not a rich man,

1675
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:44.890
spends tens of thousand dollars,
got gets all of this excavator equipment,

1676
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:48.190
goes to this very remote area of Northwestern Australia,

1677
01:33:48.370 --> 01:33:52.990
pulls up something like $10 million worth of treasure,
takes it home legally,

1678
01:33:52.991 --> 01:33:56.230
declares it all.
Tells,
tells the government gets all compensated.

1679
01:33:56.231 --> 01:33:57.580
They give him three or four pieces,

1680
01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:59.890
you could see his treasure in the museum in Perth.

1681
01:34:02.230 --> 01:34:05.560
Here's this guy who would've retired,
been a wealthy man,
you know,

1682
01:34:05.561 --> 01:34:08.530
had his whole life taken care of because of this thing he was obsessed with,

1683
01:34:08.531 --> 01:34:11.980
and then found and then got the tools on his own dime to go and get it,

1684
01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.410
declares it,
and has a confiscated Tude.

1685
01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:18.160
Well that's weird because you find stuff in the ocean and they take it and

1686
01:34:18.161 --> 01:34:19.750
people become billionaires,
right?

1687
01:34:19.751 --> 01:34:24.090
They find Russian or a Roman chair ships filled with gold coins and,

1688
01:34:24.790 --> 01:34:25.820
but for whatever reason,

1689
01:34:25.821 --> 01:34:29.830
like this was considered like a history historically valuable.

1690
01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:34.660
So it was taken for the museum.
Right.
And he got,
yeah,
a few coins and no money.

1691
01:34:35.490 --> 01:34:39.340
I got to look up the guy's name.
I know a similar story.
It's happened in America.

1692
01:34:39.400 --> 01:34:43.160
Okay.
Uh,
the guy that went to hunt it got investors.
Right.

1693
01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:46.930
And when he got the gold,
he just kept it.

1694
01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:50.680
When the investors asked for the money,
he shorted said,

1695
01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.360
I don't know what you're talking about.
I lost it.

1696
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:55.480
Or I don't know where I put it or I don't know where it is.
So He's,

1697
01:34:55.780 --> 01:34:59.450
I think he's currently in under contempt of court.
Oh Geez.

1698
01:34:59.451 --> 01:35:02.660
Being asked where is it?
And he said,
I don't know.

1699
01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:06.500
It's taking a lot of tests or tests that people think has kids have it or

1700
01:35:06.501 --> 01:35:10.700
something like that,
but they have no idea where it is.
It's a crazy story.

1701
01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.700
Well that's a weird one too because like what are you going to do with it?
Right?

1702
01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:16.820
Like if people are staring at you,
they're,
they're like constantly look,

1703
01:35:16.821 --> 01:35:18.470
where is it?
Where is it?
Like I don't have it.

1704
01:35:18.650 --> 01:35:22.070
They're going to keep looking like how much is it worth?
Millions.

1705
01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.490
I think each coin might be worth a million and he might have something like 20

1706
01:35:25.491 --> 01:35:28.340
to 30 of them.
It's like a lot of money.
It's insane.
Well,

1707
01:35:28.341 --> 01:35:31.490
you've got to bring it to someone who's going to give you a piece.
You know,

1708
01:35:31.491 --> 01:35:34.190
you got to bring it to someone,
but then then you're going to get caught.

1709
01:35:34.220 --> 01:35:38.630
Where'd you get the 5 million then?
What exactly found it?
Yeah.

1710
01:35:38.631 --> 01:35:41.600
What do you do?
Well,
it's interesting when things are historical,
right?

1711
01:35:41.630 --> 01:35:45.590
You don't know like who,
who does it belong to?
A museum.

1712
01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:48.290
Does it belong to the person who finds it?
Like what are the,

1713
01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.860
what are the rules and are we making these rules up as we go along?
It's,
yeah,

1714
01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:55.370
it's worth 20 million.
There's,
I'd found a story.
It's still in jail right now.

1715
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:59.990
Wow.
Jail treasure hunter ordered to pay nearly 20 million.

1716
01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:04.370
This is Tommy Thompson.
Tommy Thompson's on it.
Yeah.

1717
01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:09.500
That sounds like the kind of guy.
Yeah.
What is that island?

1718
01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:11.000
There's One island that has,

1719
01:36:11.001 --> 01:36:15.980
I'm like this crazy hole in the ground that was made by pirates,

1720
01:36:16.190 --> 01:36:17.840
like captain cook or something like that.
Well,

1721
01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:22.520
there's a television show about it.
The Curse of Oak Island.
Yes.
The show.

1722
01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:26.690
Yeah.
It's up in Canada,
right?
In Canada.
Yes.

1723
01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.150
And they have some crazy hole in the ground right there.

1724
01:36:29.151 --> 01:36:30.560
Trying to figure out how to get into.

1725
01:36:30.561 --> 01:36:34.190
But there's all these weird little traps and,
Yep.
That's exactly right.
Yeah.

1726
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:38.540
What do they think's in there?
Some astronomically valuable treasure.
Right.

1727
01:36:38.541 --> 01:36:42.020
And I believe the islands changed hands like seven or eight times because people

1728
01:36:42.050 --> 01:36:46.730
trying to find it have gone broke,
digging it up,
excavating and exploring it,

1729
01:36:46.731 --> 01:36:50.300
and there's booby traps and all this crazy stuff.
Yeah.

1730
01:36:50.301 --> 01:36:54.560
There's some sort of a method that they've devised where if you go deep enough,

1731
01:36:54.561 --> 01:36:57.890
it just fills up with water so you can never get to the actual treasure itself.

1732
01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.590
Right.
So the people mate who put the treasure there,

1733
01:37:00.591 --> 01:37:02.300
it might have fucked themselves.
Like totally.

1734
01:37:02.301 --> 01:37:05.600
We're assuming they're so smart that they buried the treasure in a way that

1735
01:37:05.601 --> 01:37:06.680
nobody could ever get it out,

1736
01:37:06.681 --> 01:37:09.530
but they might've just burned it in way that they couldn't even get it out.

1737
01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:12.260
I think that's the case.
I think it's one of those like,
oh,

1738
01:37:12.261 --> 01:37:15.140
we're going to keep it here and then they couldn't get it.
I mean,
who knows?

1739
01:37:15.141 --> 01:37:19.810
But yeah.
What a crazy story.
Yeah.
So do they know who did it?
I'm not sure.

1740
01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:23.840
See if he can find something on that Oak island so that television shows,

1741
01:37:24.650 --> 01:37:27.260
it's just like,
they're just like going,
well,
now what?
Right.

1742
01:37:27.290 --> 01:37:32.060
I think they're just digging and trying so he can't suck all the water out.

1743
01:37:32.061 --> 01:37:35.080
Right.
Cause he's getting water from the ocean sea level.
So yeah,

1744
01:37:35.110 --> 01:37:38.510
just constantly filling up.
Right.
So unless you go down there with the submarine,

1745
01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:41.320
I think they've put divers in it.
They've had metal detectors to,

1746
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:43.700
I don't really know.
I,
I'm not super familiar with the show.

1747
01:37:43.701 --> 01:37:46.640
I just know someone that was there and um,
yeah,

1748
01:37:46.641 --> 01:37:51.350
I think it's this pretty serious ongoing thing.
Which buried treasure.
Right.

1749
01:37:51.351 --> 01:37:55.740
Remember when you were a kid,
there was x marks,
the spot,
the clamps.
Cool night.

1750
01:37:55.741 --> 01:37:59.280
The so called Knights Templar cross is one of the most exciting treasures found

1751
01:37:59.281 --> 01:38:00.450
there.
Really?

1752
01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:05.660
But they found it so called says upon first glance it resembles a knights

1753
01:38:06.031 --> 01:38:08.820
Templar cross.
Do they have a picture of that thing?
Doesn't show right here.

1754
01:38:08.850 --> 01:38:12.720
Mm hmm.
So yeah,
when they find these,

1755
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:15.960
if they've in the open ocean,
when they find these things,

1756
01:38:15.961 --> 01:38:19.140
it's whoever finds it gets to keep it right.
If it's an international water,

1757
01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.140
I believe so.
So when they have like these ancient Roman ships,

1758
01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.950
but you still have to bring it back into port and to Claire it what makes it

1759
01:38:25.951 --> 01:38:28.980
historically valuable?
Like I think there's,
it's a lot.

1760
01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:32.580
I feel like there's a lot of loopholes where you can get screwed out of your

1761
01:38:32.581 --> 01:38:37.560
find.
Yeah,
man.
Yeah.
It's,
that's a weird one.

1762
01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:41.970
Who owns that?
Right?
Who knows?
Yeah.
I don't know.

1763
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.051
It's a,

1764
01:38:43.051 --> 01:38:46.590
it's just interesting to me that there were so many ships that went down that

1765
01:38:46.591 --> 01:38:50.100
you can find these things in the ocean still.
Yup.
Then they're filled with gold.

1766
01:38:50.101 --> 01:38:54.180
He's raise ships and people,
people retire off of it and you know,

1767
01:38:54.210 --> 01:38:58.020
spend their whole career and lose every dime they have.
Trying to find one.
Yeah.

1768
01:38:58.021 --> 01:38:59.130
And how do they coordinate?

1769
01:38:59.131 --> 01:39:02.130
Did they'd read like old logs or something like that and try to figure out which

1770
01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:06.090
way the people went.
And I had no idea,
man.

1771
01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:11.480
So what other like crazy trips do you want to do that you haven't done yet?

1772
01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:14.280
Oh,
there's a lot,
man.
I mean,

1773
01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:17.130
the one that I've had on my bucket list and sounds are,
so there's a couple of,

1774
01:39:17.131 --> 01:39:21.570
one is there's one really one place on earth left where there's true cannibals.

1775
01:39:21.670 --> 01:39:23.780
It's Papa New Guinea.
And um,

1776
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:26.910
unlike the missionary that went in with an agenda,

1777
01:39:26.911 --> 01:39:30.780
I would just love to actually see these,
these cannibalistic tribe.

1778
01:39:30.781 --> 01:39:33.740
So I'd love to do that.
Nobody has successfully,

1779
01:39:33.741 --> 01:39:36.990
unless it happened very recently and I'm not aware of successfully done source

1780
01:39:36.991 --> 01:39:39.810
to see of the Congo River from guerrilla warfare,

1781
01:39:39.811 --> 01:39:43.710
from crazy waterfalls disease.
That's an expedition I'd like to try.

1782
01:39:43.980 --> 01:39:47.190
And then when it comes to wildlife,
I mean,
the list is infinite.

1783
01:39:47.191 --> 01:39:50.730
There's so many of these animals that I'm desperate to try and find those sound

1784
01:39:50.731 --> 01:39:55.620
like very dangerous trips,
like visiting cannibals.
Yeah.

1785
01:39:55.621 --> 01:39:59.160
I mean like,
I don't know how to say this without sounding arrogant,

1786
01:39:59.161 --> 01:40:02.910
but that's what sounds exciting to me.
You know,
is giving that shot,

1787
01:40:02.911 --> 01:40:04.950
that other taking that shot that other people aren't taking.

1788
01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:09.600
So have people visited these cannibals and come out of there?
Yep,
Yep.

1789
01:40:09.630 --> 01:40:13.500
There was a,
there was a nat geo photographer who got some incredible photos.

1790
01:40:13.501 --> 01:40:16.860
They're called the car away tribe.
And um,
he went in there,

1791
01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:20.220
took him a while for them to kind of assimilate and get comfortable.

1792
01:40:20.221 --> 01:40:22.410
And then he got these photos that are just mind blowing.

1793
01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:26.700
Now how often do they practice cannibalism?
It is a,

1794
01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:31.230
it's not a daily thing.
It is a spiritual thing where they actually eat the,

1795
01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:36.620
eat the other tribes deceased after a war or an inter tribal conflict as a way

1796
01:40:38.311 --> 01:40:41.040
to like ward off bad spirits.
So it's not like a daily thing.

1797
01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:42.810
It's not like they're going out hunting each other.

1798
01:40:42.811 --> 01:40:45.240
It's more like when these things occur,

1799
01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:48.240
they have to eat a certain killer,

1800
01:40:48.241 --> 01:40:50.640
a certain body to keep evil spirits at bay.

1801
01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.130
Do they get that version of mad cow's disease that cannibals get?

1802
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.370
<v 0>Was it Jakub Kraits Velde I know what you're talking about.
I'm not sure.</v>

1803
01:40:57.371 --> 01:41:00.010
I think it's probably infrequent enough that they're not getting it.

1804
01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:02.710
Cause like in the,
in the South Pacific,
they got that all the time,

1805
01:41:02.711 --> 01:41:07.150
but they were eating each other like all the time.
Yeah.
Well,

1806
01:41:07.151 --> 01:41:10.820
I think you'd get it from nerves.
Right.
And nerve tissue or brain brain.
Yeah.

1807
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:13.600
That's,
that's where they're getting it from.
It's essentially mad cow disease.

1808
01:41:13.630 --> 01:41:16.450
Exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Is this guy hanging out with them there?

1809
01:41:16.690 --> 01:41:18.520
It starts off a sound and he's eating something,

1810
01:41:18.521 --> 01:41:21.930
I don't think cause eating people with them going to eat a fucking person.

1811
01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:27.910
I don't think they show that.
But yeah,
look at the tribe.

1812
01:41:27.911 --> 01:41:29.170
I mean they're just look amazing,

1813
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:34.180
but it's just so incredible that there's still people that live the way they

1814
01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:37.270
lived many,
many,
many thousands of years ago.

1815
01:41:37.271 --> 01:41:39.610
And they essentially just get their resources from the land,

1816
01:41:39.611 --> 01:41:43.810
from the area they live and they're,
they're just rocking it old school.

1817
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:46.780
And then for me,
it like,
the cultural significance is huge,

1818
01:41:46.781 --> 01:41:51.520
but what's the biological area like?
You're right,
nobody's going in there.

1819
01:41:51.640 --> 01:41:54.910
How much biological studies been done?
The answer is none.

1820
01:41:56.050 --> 01:42:00.550
And these people have large,
popular,
like,
look at that lady.
Amazing.

1821
01:42:01.210 --> 01:42:06.080
Wow.
Yeah.
Um,
do you,

1822
01:42:06.081 --> 01:42:09.550
have you read 'em Sapiens,
sapiens?
No,

1823
01:42:09.551 --> 01:42:13.210
I'm not a evolutionary book about even his Shola.

1824
01:42:13.211 --> 01:42:17.530
You've all Herati I think that's the name of his,
he's amazing writing it down.

1825
01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:19.090
Yeah,
it's a,
it's a great book.

1826
01:42:19.091 --> 01:42:23.590
But one of the things that they talk about in the book was these nomadic tribes

1827
01:42:23.591 --> 01:42:26.020
that would,
yeah,
that's it.
Uh,

1828
01:42:26.110 --> 01:42:29.820
you've all Noah Herati I fucked up his name.
Um,

1829
01:42:30.010 --> 01:42:35.010
they would talk about these nomadic tribes that would kill the old ladies,

1830
01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.570
like killed the people that were burdens and like,

1831
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:39.980
cause you sh shows like them and they'll just kill him.

1832
01:42:40.130 --> 01:42:43.060
Just talking about like with people became a problem,
right?

1833
01:42:43.070 --> 01:42:46.210
They would just kill him.
And this was normal,
but they got along together great.

1834
01:42:46.290 --> 01:42:48.820
Everybody was like laughing and smiling.
Everybody's really friendly.

1835
01:42:48.821 --> 01:42:51.670
But as soon as someone's seemed to be a problem,
they'd fucking club.

1836
01:42:51.670 --> 01:42:55.870
I'm from behind.
And just,
it's like,
this is gonna sound awful,

1837
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:58.960
but doesn't that make sense?
It kind of does.
It sucks.

1838
01:42:58.961 --> 01:43:03.310
But it kind of does like you're a burden on the community or on the society,

1839
01:43:03.570 --> 01:43:08.230
you know,
there's no fucking old folks home out there.
Yeah.
That's,
it's crazy.

1840
01:43:08.231 --> 01:43:10.690
Like to us,
in our culture,
that's absurd.

1841
01:43:10.691 --> 01:43:14.220
But as a culture removed from the rest of the world.
Makes Sense.

1842
01:43:14.230 --> 01:43:16.450
Like you're a burden,
you know you've had a good life.

1843
01:43:16.570 --> 01:43:19.510
It's time to move on and there are no magic.
That's the other thing.

1844
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:23.590
It's like they have to keep moving.
So if someone stops and like there's one guy,

1845
01:43:23.591 --> 01:43:28.270
he was sick and so they left him on a tree and he became covered with buzzard

1846
01:43:28.271 --> 01:43:32.380
shit cause the vultures would just sit over him and wait for him to die.

1847
01:43:32.530 --> 01:43:36.790
But he eventually recovered and he caught up with the rest of the tribe and for

1848
01:43:36.791 --> 01:43:37.640
the rest of the,

1849
01:43:37.641 --> 01:43:39.910
they call them something like buzzard shit or something like that.

1850
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:43.450
That was their nickname for him.
Yeah.
Imagine being that guy.

1851
01:43:43.451 --> 01:43:46.540
Imagine sitting under a tree looking up at vultures being like,

1852
01:43:46.930 --> 01:43:49.480
it's moments till I die and they're going to drop down and eat me.

1853
01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.820
At least they're polite enough to wait for you to die.
They don't just,

1854
01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:56.930
the guy probably couldn't have fought them off.
That was,
yeah,

1855
01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:04.010
they're the trippiest of all the animals that the matriarchal society of them,

1856
01:44:04.011 --> 01:44:08.690
where the females have the fake Dick's.
They're amazing.
How bizarre.
So weird,

1857
01:44:08.691 --> 01:44:09.740
crazy faces.

1858
01:44:09.741 --> 01:44:14.741
Crazy biology and anatomy that fell a form that catlike but doesn't belong to

1859
01:44:14.931 --> 01:44:19.670
any family like super weird.
And a lot of them,
they have a giant fake Dick.

1860
01:44:19.690 --> 01:44:22.190
The females have a giant fake dick they give birth to,

1861
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:24.150
they do birth out of rather.
Yep.
Yeah.

1862
01:44:24.151 --> 01:44:28.070
And they have an unbelievable biting power to write the strongest Mammalian job

1863
01:44:28.071 --> 01:44:30.810
pressure on earth.
What a weird looking animal too.

1864
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:35.390
Don't like even with the weight will shoulder like totally looks like a villain.

1865
01:44:36.130 --> 01:44:41.110
Like it's upper body is like higher than its lower body.
Very strange dairy.

1866
01:44:41.240 --> 01:44:42.960
What is it like when you encounter those in a while?

1867
01:44:42.961 --> 01:44:47.960
They sketching very cowardly,
very um,
wary at all times.
Like,
uh,

1868
01:44:49.730 --> 01:44:52.730
I've encountered them a lot and as,
as it,
when you're in Africa,

1869
01:44:52.731 --> 01:44:55.580
if they're taller,
if you're taller than it generally won't attack you.

1870
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:58.310
So people get like super scared of hyenas.
When I was a little boy,

1871
01:44:58.340 --> 01:45:01.220
I learned if you're running in the bush and you see a Hyena stand up and put

1872
01:45:01.221 --> 01:45:04.000
your arms up like that,
they say that about cats too,
right?
Like,

1873
01:45:04.030 --> 01:45:08.630
like mountain lions.
Look at that motherfucker.
Jesus,
look at that thing.

1874
01:45:08.631 --> 01:45:12.690
Man.
That's so cool.
It doesn't even a lie.
Go.
Huh?

1875
01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:18.350
Cool.
Hi Sir.
It's very cool.
It's not at my house.
It's so creepy looking.

1876
01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.150
Yeah.
I love when they,
uh,
they circled lions too,

1877
01:45:21.151 --> 01:45:22.940
like when they get enough of them together.

1878
01:45:22.941 --> 01:45:26.330
And let's start circling and snapping at the lions legs and strength in numbers.

1879
01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:31.730
Yup.
If you ever see there's a documentary on this one.
Um,
male lion who,

1880
01:45:31.731 --> 01:45:35.900
uh,
would kill all these hyenas and he was like the enforcer for the tribe.

1881
01:45:35.930 --> 01:45:36.400
No Way.

1882
01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:40.700
See how the hyenas would come in and fuck with the female lions and giant mail

1883
01:45:40.701 --> 01:45:42.770
would come out of nowhere and there's video of it,

1884
01:45:43.070 --> 01:45:47.210
video of him smashing these hyenas,
just grabbing them with his giant head,

1885
01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.400
shaking them,
snapping them,
a,

1886
01:45:49.401 --> 01:45:51.860
tossing them in the air and then chasing after another one and,

1887
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:55.760
and killing them to unreal.
No,
I haven't seen that.
That's amazing.

1888
01:45:55.940 --> 01:46:00.190
Have you ever seen relentless enemies?
You ever seen that documentary on Netflix?

1889
01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:04.500
No.
No.
No.
It's um,
it might be on Netflix.
Dude,
I've got so much homework to do.

1890
01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:10.540
Enemies is a documentary about a very rare pack of lions that branched the,

1891
01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:17.580
the river changed its course and left them stranded on an island with water

1892
01:46:19.251 --> 01:46:21.320
buffalo.
Okay.
So they,

1893
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:26.440
they developed like a much larger frame and they're like far larger than regular

1894
01:46:28.941 --> 01:46:33.700
lines,
like the female lions in this pack or as big as male lions anywhere.

1895
01:46:33.710 --> 01:46:36.890
Oh Wow.
They're enormous.
They don't even look real.
Is this relentless?
Yeah,

1896
01:46:36.891 --> 01:46:41.090
it's from 2006.
Oh,
it's not very old.
It's also book.
Oh,
okay.
Um,

1897
01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:46.120
but what's really cool is that they've evolved to take down these enormous

1898
01:46:47.060 --> 01:46:50.700
buffalo.
Sure.
So the,
the cats,
when you look at them,

1899
01:46:50.701 --> 01:46:54.980
they'd look like a lot that,
that looks normal there.
But it's all relative,

1900
01:46:54.981 --> 01:46:58.800
isn't it?
That looks like a normal one.
But some of them look so muscular,

1901
01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:03.390
they almost look fake.
Oof.
Oh,
he's getting is.
Oh Wow.
She's half,

1902
01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:07.500
she's getting the calf.
Yeah.
Cape Buffalo or terrifying too,
by the way.
Fuck yeah.

1903
01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.370
And she's like fucking,
but there's,
you know,

1904
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:14.040
very few things that they can eat on this one island.

1905
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:19.041
So they develop this ability to just have larger frames and they're much more

1906
01:47:19.531 --> 01:47:22.010
muscular.
And apparently there's that.

1907
01:47:22.011 --> 01:47:25.950
What's really interesting is there's this pack that's really big,

1908
01:47:25.951 --> 01:47:30.060
but then there's another pack that lives on the island as normal sized.
Huh?
Yeah.

1909
01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:34.410
So they must be eating the smaller prey species.
I don't know man.
I'm too stupid.

1910
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:37.290
But it's the same thing.
So size of that fucker.

1911
01:47:37.320 --> 01:47:41.370
Leave that musculature and the hindquarters.
Yeah.
I mean she's built like a male.

1912
01:47:41.371 --> 01:47:44.190
She's built like a large male line.
I mean that is on steroids.
Yeah.

1913
01:47:44.191 --> 01:47:48.330
That's a big female.
Yeah.
They're the same thing that happened in Newfoundland,

1914
01:47:48.331 --> 01:47:49.950
Canada with the walls.
You love wolves.

1915
01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.210
So there was the silent Newfoundland and um,
there's wolves,

1916
01:47:54.211 --> 01:47:58.140
gray wolves for isolated there for long,
long time and day.
All Day we're eating,

1917
01:47:58.141 --> 01:48:00.420
we're moose and Caribou.
So they just got huge.

1918
01:48:00.450 --> 01:48:02.760
And they were bright white because it was a snow covered island,

1919
01:48:03.150 --> 01:48:07.440
like 80% of the year.
And there were just these massive white wolves all jacked,

1920
01:48:07.441 --> 01:48:11.040
all shredded chasing around Moose and Caribou.
Wow.

1921
01:48:11.850 --> 01:48:16.850
It's just the way nature allows animals to adapt to their environment.

1922
01:48:17.071 --> 01:48:21.120
It's just unbelievably interesting.
It's,
it's what I live for,
honestly.

1923
01:48:21.121 --> 01:48:23.660
It's so fascinating.
The,
the eco,

1924
01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:27.840
the ecological niches that each animal like fulfills and the roles that they

1925
01:48:27.841 --> 01:48:29.130
play within each other,

1926
01:48:29.131 --> 01:48:32.760
it's all perfectly balanced and to to see it and understand it,

1927
01:48:32.761 --> 01:48:34.620
like it's fantastic to see the individual,

1928
01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:38.040
but to understand the big picture of the environment and the roles that are

1929
01:48:38.041 --> 01:48:41.070
filled.
As you say,
it's like it's mindblowing.
Yeah.

1930
01:48:41.071 --> 01:48:44.640
There's a documentary on the Congo from the BBC from,

1931
01:48:44.641 --> 01:48:46.320
I want to say like the early two thousands,

1932
01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.870
maybe even late nineties and it goes into that into detail about how all of

1933
01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:54.810
these animals have adapted and like Dikers hikers in the Congo that swim

1934
01:48:54.811 --> 01:48:58.410
underwater for as much as a hundred yards,
no ate fish.

1935
01:48:58.740 --> 01:49:03.540
Some of them eat fish,
a fish eating antelope,
the antelope that swims.

1936
01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:08.610
Yeah.
And then all these animals that got trapped as the,
the,
this area,

1937
01:49:08.611 --> 01:49:10.830
these grasslands turned into rain forest.

1938
01:49:11.010 --> 01:49:13.440
These animals that were essentially like grasslands,

1939
01:49:13.441 --> 01:49:16.920
animals like antelopes and stuff are stuck right in the fucking jungle.

1940
01:49:16.921 --> 01:49:21.921
The swampy jungle and he see like these in these big packs of like antelope

1941
01:49:22.471 --> 01:49:26.820
running through this swampy jungle area where they just don't look like they

1942
01:49:26.821 --> 01:49:30.130
belonged there.
It doesn't say long and fields and that's how speciation occurs.

1943
01:49:30.131 --> 01:49:30.331
Right?

1944
01:49:30.331 --> 01:49:34.920
So that Dika over a millennia develops fangs to catch those fish and a crocodile

1945
01:49:34.921 --> 01:49:38.430
like face and web hooves or you know,
I don't know.
I'm making shit up.

1946
01:49:38.431 --> 01:49:41.970
But the point is that's how you get these crazy new species and here in the

1947
01:49:41.971 --> 01:49:42.631
middle of Congo,

1948
01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:45.660
in this tiny little pocket is this animal that nobody's ever seen before kind of

1949
01:49:45.661 --> 01:49:48.100
thing.
And that like,
to me that's what it's all about.

1950
01:49:48.370 --> 01:49:51.670
<v 1>Go to the Congo,
find that thing,
you know,
is it there?
What is it?</v>

1951
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:55.120
<v 0>That's why someone like me is so incredibly thankful that there's someone like</v>

1952
01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:59.470
you out there because I don't want to go there.
I don't want to go there,

1953
01:49:59.471 --> 01:50:01.900
but I want to look at your Instagram page.
I guarantee you'd love it.

1954
01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:05.050
I'm sure a hundred percent sure.
I'm 100% sure you're right.

1955
01:50:05.051 --> 01:50:09.820
I'm also 100% sure I'm not going,
but I'm happy that you go.

1956
01:50:10.090 --> 01:50:11.560
I mean I'm,
I'm,

1957
01:50:11.860 --> 01:50:15.430
I'm so fascinated by animals and just animal life and adaptation.

1958
01:50:15.431 --> 01:50:18.280
I think that's one of the more interesting things about this planet definitely

1959
01:50:18.340 --> 01:50:22.600
is these weird organisms that are trying to figure out their way to,

1960
01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:24.250
to survival,
you know,

1961
01:50:24.251 --> 01:50:27.670
and then we're going to swap the thing and moving and changing and we're always

1962
01:50:27.671 --> 01:50:31.900
finding new ones.
Like I found a fucking snake.
I posted it up on um,

1963
01:50:32.110 --> 01:50:34.690
on Twitter like a week or so ago.

1964
01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:38.830
A snake that has a tail that looks like a fake spider.

1965
01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:40.430
Have you seen that?

1966
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:43.260
<v 1>I,
I'm not sure.
What do you know the species of it?
I know the species.
Yeah,</v>

1967
01:50:43.900 --> 01:50:44.733
<v 0>I think it's from,</v>

1968
01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:50.640
I think it's from Iran and its a rattlesnake hyper scale scaled pit viper.

1969
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:54.190
Is that it?
Yeah.
So Viper not allow snake born Viper Viper.

1970
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:57.550
If you seen that thing.
I know what they are.
Yeah.
It's incredible.

1971
01:50:57.630 --> 01:51:01.720
Looks like a spider and it tricks birds into coming down and try to snatch the

1972
01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:04.930
spider.
Here we go.
The Iranians spider,

1973
01:51:04.931 --> 01:51:08.680
that viper spider tailed viper,
like look at its tail.

1974
01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:13.570
That is crazy.
I mean I'm looking at that in a video and it looks like a bug,

1975
01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:14.350
right?

1976
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:18.850
And so this thing moves its tail and it perfectly blends into the rock around
it.

1977
01:51:18.851 --> 01:51:22.930
Like look at that and I'm in that amount of camouflage and adaptation.

1978
01:51:22.931 --> 01:51:27.640
Like how does that happen?
It's incredible.
This,
it's boom,

1979
01:51:27.760 --> 01:51:31.660
oh,
got you.
Bitch done.
Zoho and the bird's like,
what was that?
That almost got me.

1980
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:36.460
Yeah,
that's insane.
What an adaptation.

1981
01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:40.300
I mean like you see the Angler fish,
that's a very bizarre adaptation as well.

1982
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:44.000
<v 1>Same thing just out of the head.
Yeah,
I,
it's,
it's unbelievable.</v>

1983
01:51:44.001 --> 01:51:47.940
I mean the fact that creatures can create that without,
you know,

1984
01:51:48.020 --> 01:51:50.500
it's not like they're doing it knowingly.
Cause some,

1985
01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:54.300
some handful of snakes at one time started wagging their tail and realizing the

1986
01:51:54.301 --> 01:51:57.590
birds came in and then over generational time,

1987
01:51:57.830 --> 01:52:01.760
this tail evolved little spikes and little things and all of a sudden you have

1988
01:52:01.761 --> 01:52:03.830
this whole population of animals that looked like that.

1989
01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:08.310
<v 0>What is it?
How the fuck does that happen?
I mean,
how does something grow?</v>

1990
01:52:08.311 --> 01:52:12.750
Something like that allure grows a lure off of its head and be like,

1991
01:52:12.751 --> 01:52:17.340
hey look,
it's something for you.
Eat.
Look at that one.

1992
01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.530
Oh my God,
that's got a worm.
That'd be the thing.

1993
01:52:19.531 --> 01:52:22.530
Literally has like a fishing worm,
like a bass worm.

1994
01:52:23.730 --> 01:52:26.160
I mean it's,
it's so amazing.

1995
01:52:26.161 --> 01:52:31.161
All of this adaptation and all of these look at that fucking monster with a

1996
01:52:31.231 --> 01:52:34.610
light growing.
I mean it's got a flashlight on its head,
but it just,

1997
01:52:34.770 --> 01:52:39.360
it's so amazing how much adaptation there is and how all these things sort of

1998
01:52:39.361 --> 01:52:40.530
work together.
Right?

1999
01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:45.560
Like there's the bacteria and the fun guy and the life and the animal life and

2000
01:52:47.331 --> 01:52:51.050
the predators and the prey and it all sort of works together.

2001
01:52:51.051 --> 01:52:52.070
And when something doesn't work,

2002
01:52:52.071 --> 01:52:57.071
it just sort of drops off and then the system sort of resets itself in a new

2003
01:52:57.291 --> 01:52:58.100
order.

2004
01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.160
<v 1>I mean,
to me there is,
you saying it's one of the most fascinating things to me.</v>

2005
01:53:01.161 --> 01:53:04.940
There is nothing more fascinating.
Like I'm,
you know,
I'm obsessed with it.

2006
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:07.370
I live for it because I find it's so interesting

2007
01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.970
<v 0>now when you study these things and you do,</v>

2008
01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:14.120
do you ever try to think like how the fuck that happened?

2009
01:53:14.121 --> 01:53:17.900
Like if you see that that spider tailed snake,

2010
01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:22.580
is there anyone that has like an idea like that this was,
you know,

2011
01:53:22.581 --> 01:53:26.570
this was just a lucky break that this one snake had a freaky tail and then he

2012
01:53:26.571 --> 01:53:27.470
got the fuck a lot

2013
01:53:27.670 --> 01:53:31.000
<v 1>does.
He ate a lot of birds.
That's the idea,
man.
You just,
I swear to God,</v>

2014
01:53:31.001 --> 01:53:32.950
you just summed it up like that is the idea.

2015
01:53:32.980 --> 01:53:36.730
W one or two or three snakes kind of got this adaptation,

2016
01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:41.650
just a random random genetic sequencing that led to maybe a white watch on the

2017
01:53:41.651 --> 01:53:42.820
tail.
Something unique.

2018
01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:46.410
<v 0>Doesn't it not seem like that though?
It seems like they fashioned it,</v>

2019
01:53:46.630 --> 01:53:49.510
<v 1>but over time over it they did,
but over millennia,</v>

2020
01:53:49.511 --> 01:53:53.140
right over thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years.

2021
01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:56.680
The one what happened was say there's two snakes with a white spot on their
tail.

2022
01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:00.010
Then they have a baby and it has little bit of deformation.

2023
01:54:00.011 --> 01:54:01.660
Write a little thing sticking out,

2024
01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:05.200
then that snake all of a sudden catches more birds than the rest of the snakes.

2025
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:09.130
That snake now reproduces offspring and its offspring that has a little bit

2026
01:54:09.131 --> 01:54:10.120
bigger of a spike,

2027
01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:15.160
catches more birds and so those become the prized animals to reproduce with,

2028
01:54:15.161 --> 01:54:19.690
to continue the gene pool.
And so that's what happens.
It keeps evolving.

2029
01:54:19.691 --> 01:54:20.800
It's like a peacock,
right?

2030
01:54:20.980 --> 01:54:24.100
But this crazy big tail that it's attracting mates with,

2031
01:54:24.130 --> 01:54:26.200
it's not useful to the bird,
you know,

2032
01:54:26.201 --> 01:54:29.830
that's entirely made for showmanship for peacocking if you will.

2033
01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:34.070
And it over generational time.
It gets bigger and crazier and more elaborate,

2034
01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:34.930
more colorful,

2035
01:54:34.930 --> 01:54:39.220
and the females literally flock to them and that's the animal that continues on.

2036
01:54:39.530 --> 01:54:41.810
<v 0>What I really wish there was a way,</v>

2037
01:54:41.811 --> 01:54:44.570
and maybe there will be sometime in the future where they're going to be able to

2038
01:54:44.571 --> 01:54:48.170
show you with like some sort of a super computer sequencing.

2039
01:54:48.470 --> 01:54:51.050
Would they be able to look at the DNA of this thing and say,
oh,

2040
01:54:51.051 --> 01:54:52.940
this is the exact progression,
right?

2041
01:54:52.941 --> 01:54:55.420
This is what it started off with and this is what it became.
Right?

2042
01:54:55.820 --> 01:54:59.330
This is how some sketchy looking forest chicken became a peacock.
Totally.

2043
01:54:59.360 --> 01:54:59.571
You know,

2044
01:54:59.571 --> 01:55:04.571
this is how some freaky snake became perfectly adapted to its environment.

2045
01:55:04.971 --> 01:55:08.000
I mean,
that thing looks exactly like the rock that it sits on.

2046
01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:12.190
<v 1>Perfect.
Yeah.
So it is incredible.
Like I would,
I'm like you,</v>

2047
01:55:12.191 --> 01:55:15.370
I'd love to know who patient zero is.
You know who's the,
who's the

2048
01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:18.830
<v 0>first one?
Yeah.
Because stupid people like may look at that and they go,
okay,</v>

2049
01:55:18.831 --> 01:55:21.650
well that's got to be a plan.
That's kind of a higher power.

2050
01:55:21.651 --> 01:55:24.920
This is something that like,
is looking after these things and making them,

2051
01:55:25.190 --> 01:55:29.900
making them evolve this way.
Right,
right.
It's,
I mean it's,
it's super interesting.

2052
01:55:29.901 --> 01:55:34.901
What about like cephalopods like octopus and cuttlefish and the way they adapt

2053
01:55:36.170 --> 01:55:39.530
their environment.
That's even freaky,
right?
Because they do it instantaneously.

2054
01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.900
<v 1>And have you ever heard the theory that octopus or from</v>

2055
01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:45.720
<v 0>of space?
Yeah,
we talked about that with Brian Cox the other day.
Yeah.
I'm not,</v>

2056
01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:49.960
I'm not super well read on it,
but like,
it looks like a damn alien.
Yeah.

2057
01:55:49.961 --> 01:55:54.480
He was very incredulous.
Uh,
but you know,
he's obviously smarter than both of us.

2058
01:55:54.600 --> 01:55:59.600
Right?
So,
so he gets to be,
it's like,
yeah,
it's like me looking at tackling mad.

2059
01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:02.520
Does it make sense?
Of course it doesn't make sense.
I'm stupid.
Right.
But he's,

2060
01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:04.440
he's,
you know,
when we're looking at this,

2061
01:56:04.650 --> 01:56:09.030
but this is apparently like peer reviewed published paper about the possibility

2062
01:56:09.031 --> 01:56:10.530
of octopus being reintroduced.

2063
01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:15.180
And I think it has something to do with the way RNA and DNA is right on them.

2064
01:56:15.181 --> 01:56:17.610
Right?
I know.
I don't understand it well,
but yes,

2065
01:56:17.611 --> 01:56:21.960
it's like the thought that the population came from out of space because the DNA

2066
01:56:21.961 --> 01:56:26.961
sequencing and suggest something that makes it extra terrestrial adaptability.

2067
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.390
Yeah.

2068
01:56:27.390 --> 01:56:30.390
He was super skeptical because he was saying that they're essentially so close

2069
01:56:30.391 --> 01:56:32.580
to everything else here.
Right.
That doesn't make sense.

2070
01:56:32.581 --> 01:56:36.360
But the other theory was it might be just this is the path of life.

2071
01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:39.780
And the reason why it's so close to us is that this is the way all life,

2072
01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:43.500
even if it's extra terrestrial,
sure gets established.
It's just,

2073
01:56:44.190 --> 01:56:46.830
I don't believe octopus are from out of space,
but I love the theory.

2074
01:56:46.831 --> 01:56:49.620
I love the idea of it.
It looks like it's from out of space.
You know,

2075
01:56:49.621 --> 01:56:52.510
it's just wacky.
Well,
it's such a cool thought.
Yeah.

2076
01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:55.290
You know that these things came from out of space as well.

2077
01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:59.340
That's also a thought about silicide mushrooms from the weirder people that they

2078
01:56:59.341 --> 01:57:03.300
came,
uh,
on asteroids and their spores.
I've heard that.
And they've,

2079
01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:05.820
I don't know if you know this,
but they've proven that certain,

2080
01:57:05.821 --> 01:57:06.810
I don't know about psilocybins,

2081
01:57:06.811 --> 01:57:10.550
but certain mushroom spores are impenetrable to the vacuum of space.
Yeah.

2082
01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:14.790
They can survive.
Yeah.
That's bananas.
I pick a lot of mushrooms,

2083
01:57:14.820 --> 01:57:19.120
not psilocybins,
but I'm a lot of porcine,
a lot of Shan't,
trails.
Like I,

2084
01:57:19.180 --> 01:57:23.430
I do a lot of foraging.
It's really fun.
Are you aware of Paul Stamets?
No.

2085
01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:27.480
I don't know.
He's amazing man.
One of my favorite podcast ever.

2086
01:57:27.660 --> 01:57:32.660
He's a mycologist of fucking trip in every sense of the word as super genius.

2087
01:57:33.661 --> 01:57:38.220
Mycologist who's the craziest story about being in highschool and what'd he say?

2088
01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.000
Took 20 grams of mushrooms and climbed a tree.
Lightning storm.

2089
01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:46.330
Which something fucking something where you hear him tell the story in your

2090
01:57:46.331 --> 01:57:50.100
hands,
start sweating,
you'll take away grams or 10 grams or 20 grand,

2091
01:57:50.101 --> 01:57:53.220
like something fucking bananas.
Like something that would kill Moose.
Yeah.

2092
01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:54.390
Well they wouldn't kill it,

2093
01:57:54.391 --> 01:57:58.500
but it would definitely make it think it's on a moose anymore and it essentially

2094
01:57:58.501 --> 01:58:00.390
changes life stopped him from stuttering,

2095
01:58:00.391 --> 01:58:03.090
he used to stutter and he did this and he stops done away.

2096
01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:08.430
I've heard about guys that micro dose with mushrooms with psilocybins and it

2097
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:12.550
heightens their focus and curious or autism and you know,
there's,

2098
01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:14.100
I'm not very well read on that,

2099
01:58:14.101 --> 01:58:18.660
but there's a whole idea that micro dosing with these chemicals that are

2100
01:58:18.661 --> 01:58:22.700
naturally produced can actually have very positive effects.
Yeah.

2101
01:58:22.710 --> 01:58:25.230
There's quite a few people do that.
It's really common.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2102
01:58:25.340 --> 01:58:27.970
I've talked to a lot of people that do that really goes with that.

2103
01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:31.040
And they also microdose with LSD.
It was a lot of that.
Really not.
Yeah.

2104
01:58:31.090 --> 01:58:33.770
A lot of silicon valley people are microdosing with LSD.

2105
01:58:33.771 --> 01:58:36.420
And it's funny because the one person that I know that's done to microdosing

2106
01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.030
with mushrooms from Silicon Valley,
yeah.

2107
01:58:38.040 --> 01:58:42.730
People grind them up into pill form and in a lot of fighters are doing that now.

2108
01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:46.210
Really,
really strange.
Yeah.
So what would that,
why would that help you?

2109
01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:49.240
Like as a fighter?
Is it,
it's not a mental focus thing.
It's a,

2110
01:58:49.241 --> 01:58:50.620
it's a physical thing at that point,
right?

2111
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:55.690
It's gets you into the flow state interest.
And so like with fighters,

2112
01:58:55.810 --> 01:58:59.500
the real thing is,
um,
it's not just your skill,

2113
01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:02.610
but it's your ability to execute that skill under pressure,
right?

2114
01:59:02.620 --> 01:59:04.660
So there's an overwhelming amount of anxiety.

2115
01:59:04.661 --> 01:59:09.610
There's extreme consequences to getting hit or going wrong.
Getting knocked out.

2116
01:59:09.611 --> 01:59:13.870
The losing a fight is absolutely devastating.
It's devastating emotionally.

2117
01:59:13.871 --> 01:59:16.720
It's devastating physically.
It's devastating.
Psychologically.

2118
01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:20.740
It changes your perception of who you are and how you fit into the world.

2119
01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:24.490
And um,
that sometimes,
and not,

2120
01:59:24.491 --> 01:59:27.580
I shouldn't say sometimes oftentimes impedes performance,

2121
01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:30.730
kind of come back from it kind of thing.
It's not just that the,

2122
01:59:30.731 --> 01:59:35.440
the consequences of it possibly go wrong,
make you hesitate and it just,
it's,

2123
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:38.680
it's the stress of it all is very constricting.

2124
01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:40.680
It's very difficult to operate under that stress.
Sure.

2125
01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:45.760
The mushrooms for some people alleviate that stress and puts you in this

2126
01:59:45.761 --> 01:59:49.480
elevated state where they say,
and I haven't,

2127
01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:51.010
I've never fought on mushrooms,

2128
01:59:51.011 --> 01:59:55.060
but they say that when you're on mushrooms you actually can see what a guy is

2129
01:59:55.061 --> 01:59:57.040
going to do before he does it.
Interest.

2130
01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.930
You have a sense of what they're going to do.

2131
01:59:58.931 --> 02:00:02.410
That's a much more heightened sense than you would if you were just in a normal

2132
02:00:02.411 --> 02:00:04.000
sober state.
So are you picking,

2133
02:00:04.001 --> 02:00:06.610
do you think you're picking that up through like biological cues?

2134
02:00:06.611 --> 02:00:09.760
Like you could see the muscles twitching in the arm before the punch comes or

2135
02:00:09.761 --> 02:00:12.430
like what,
how do you think that?
It's a good question.
I haven't done it.

2136
02:00:12.610 --> 02:00:13.630
I don't know.
You know,

2137
02:00:13.631 --> 02:00:16.780
I've never sparred on mushrooms or doesn't like a good idea.

2138
02:00:17.150 --> 02:00:18.400
That's a really common,

2139
02:00:18.401 --> 02:00:21.040
they say it is a good idea that the guys who do it love it.

2140
02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:23.740
If an interest and guys of like,
you know,

2141
02:00:23.741 --> 02:00:28.270
had some really extreme positive results.
Huh?
Yeah.
That's fascinating.

2142
02:00:28.271 --> 02:00:32.110
I never thought as an athletic performer that athletic enhancement,

2143
02:00:32.111 --> 02:00:35.230
that would be a thing.
Yeah.
It's not just the,

2144
02:00:35.290 --> 02:00:39.720
I mean I don't think it makes you move faster or hit stronger,

2145
02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:43.210
hit harder.
But I think what it does is it puts you in the zone.
Interesting.

2146
02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:46.540
There's,
there's states that you get into where you just,

2147
02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:50.980
you can't do no wrong and they're usually very elusive.
They come and they go,

2148
02:00:51.190 --> 02:00:54.990
you know,
you get them like,
um,
do you ever play pool?
I did a little bit.
I mean,

2149
02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:58.130
but you know how sometimes you play pool for a few hours and then you just feel

2150
02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:01.360
you can't miss.
You just have this feeling of where everything's going to go.

2151
02:01:01.361 --> 02:01:03.850
That's even if you're not very good.
Sometimes those,

2152
02:01:03.970 --> 02:01:07.960
those little conflict to tree shots,
the zone,
you know,
and um,

2153
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:12.700
that elusive state of like re,
and then sometimes you're like,
wow,

2154
02:01:12.701 --> 02:01:14.920
I can't believe I'm in the zone.
And then it goes away.
Right.
You know,

2155
02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:20.170
maintaining that flow state.
What do you think?
It takes emotions out of it.

2156
02:01:20.171 --> 02:01:22.090
Like is that,
is that why you're in that state?

2157
02:01:22.091 --> 02:01:25.300
Like if you're not emotionally attached to it,
that shot or that punch,

2158
02:01:25.630 --> 02:01:27.850
maybe you can execute it better.
It's possible.

2159
02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:30.370
I mean there's a lot of speculation of what's going on,

2160
02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:34.060
what's causing this elevated state of consciousness.
It's interesting.
Yeah.

2161
02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:34.913
I don't know.

2162
02:01:35.210 --> 02:01:38.230
I'll just start microdosing I'm mushrooms and going out to chase snakes around.

2163
02:01:38.350 --> 02:01:40.130
Maybe,
maybe you would be like more

2164
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:44.050
<v 1>in tune with the environment or maybe I'd get bitten and die.
That's true too.</v>

2165
02:01:44.450 --> 02:01:48.920
Hello?
Is it a snake?
Fuck you.
You are.
Okay,
so I'm not,

2166
02:01:48.921 --> 02:01:50.570
I'm not like a big drug guy by any means,

2167
02:01:50.571 --> 02:01:54.470
but I think you'll love this story on this Amazon trip I told you about.

2168
02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:56.720
We land on this airstrip and then his plan we meet,

2169
02:01:56.810 --> 02:01:59.780
we get into this village and I'm like,
cool,
boats have made it here.

2170
02:01:59.781 --> 02:02:02.280
It took the boats five days.
We're going to head up river.
Right?

2171
02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:05.480
And are like translators,
like you can't do that yet.
I'm like,
what do you mean?

2172
02:02:05.481 --> 02:02:07.490
Like we've spent months planning this.
He's like,

2173
02:02:07.491 --> 02:02:11.900
you have to have the Shamans blessing to go up river.
And I'm like,
okay,

2174
02:02:11.901 --> 02:02:13.520
what does that mean?
He's like,
come to the Maloca,

2175
02:02:13.521 --> 02:02:16.370
which is the like spiritual house.
So we go to the spiritual house,

2176
02:02:16.730 --> 02:02:20.270
we sit around and we talk and we talk and we talk and it's like hours of not

2177
02:02:20.271 --> 02:02:21.380
like asking him to go,

2178
02:02:21.381 --> 02:02:25.160
but just like almost like idle conversation where he's almost like interviewing

2179
02:02:25.161 --> 02:02:27.980
us like,
well,
what are you doing?
Where are you going?
Where are you from?

2180
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:30.350
And he doesn't really understand any of this,
right?
He's like,

2181
02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:34.160
he's living in this community.
Long story short,
he goes,
okay,
you can go,

2182
02:02:34.370 --> 02:02:37.130
but you have to take this blessing.
And we're like,
sure,

2183
02:02:37.131 --> 02:02:41.060
we'll whatever you need for us to go.
So he pulls out the snail shell.

2184
02:02:41.090 --> 02:02:42.050
I could show you a picture of it.

2185
02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:46.850
It's a snail shell with a monkey bone and the top and a tube worm to close it.

2186
02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:49.940
And in this snail,
Shell is the green powder and he's like,

2187
02:02:49.941 --> 02:02:51.320
this is what you need for the blessing.

2188
02:02:51.620 --> 02:02:54.620
So he goes around the circle and threw a monkey bone pipe.

2189
02:02:54.621 --> 02:02:58.630
He blows this green stuff and your nose is it called the [inaudible] not

2190
02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:02.570
[inaudible] word that we heard.
I couldn't tell the name of the pipe.
No,
no.

2191
02:03:02.571 --> 02:03:07.460
The stuff they blow up your nose is a DMT.
It's coca leaf.
Oh.

2192
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:12.160
Mixed with a bunch of a root and tobacco I believe like altogether.
And um,

2193
02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:14.270
anyway,
so he goes,
there's five of us in my crew.

2194
02:03:14.271 --> 02:03:16.940
He goes around the circle and he hits three guys and they all go,
whoa.

2195
02:03:16.941 --> 02:03:19.220
My brain feels like I've got chlorine on the head.
You know,

2196
02:03:19.221 --> 02:03:21.860
whatever loads it into your nose.
Yeah.
So it gets really close.

2197
02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:25.820
It's got this long tubular monkey bone pipe and he goes and it just blows it up

2198
02:03:25.821 --> 02:03:28.190
into your nose and a hits.

2199
02:03:28.191 --> 02:03:31.460
Three of my guys and I'm watching a little bit nervous cause like I'm very like

2200
02:03:31.490 --> 02:03:35.210
standoffish on drugs.
Like I know things affect me very strangely.
Anyway,

2201
02:03:35.211 --> 02:03:38.570
hits three of my guys,
they go whoa,
you know,
eyes watering and they're like,
wow,

2202
02:03:38.571 --> 02:03:43.550
it's a,
it's actually a great feeling.
Gets to my turn
in the nose.

2203
02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:48.380
All of a sudden I feel like I've got acid on my brain,
like chlorine in my head.

2204
02:03:48.590 --> 02:03:50.060
I break into the sweat,

2205
02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:55.240
my eyes explode and I'm like wobbling like this and it 30 seconds later I'm just

2206
02:03:56.181 --> 02:03:58.280
curled over in the fetal position,

2207
02:03:58.281 --> 02:04:03.260
just projectile vomiting cannot hold it together.
And uh,
Lorenzo,
this,

2208
02:04:03.261 --> 02:04:08.210
the,
the tribal shaman goes good,
good.
And we're like,
why is this good?

2209
02:04:08.211 --> 02:04:11.300
And he's like,
he had a bad spirit in him.
If he had gone up the river,

2210
02:04:11.480 --> 02:04:13.940
he would have been killed.
He's just got the bad spirit out.

2211
02:04:13.970 --> 02:04:16.430
This is why I had to bless you.
Now you can go.

2212
02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:19.760
And I was the only one that had hit like that out of our five person crew.

2213
02:04:19.761 --> 02:04:21.860
Everybody else was like,
oh my brain sore,
whatever.

2214
02:04:21.861 --> 02:04:26.380
I was literally fetal position,
feverish,
puking cray.
And I've,

2215
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:30.170
I've never done any drugs like hard drugs.
Like it's just not my thing.

2216
02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:34.460
And this thing just hit me like a ton of bricks after he said that.

2217
02:04:34.461 --> 02:04:38.010
Did you think was there a po?
I mean you're a scientist,
you're a very smart

2218
02:04:38.010 --> 02:04:42.750
<v 2>guy,
but was there a part of you that was like,
man,
he's this guy,
right?
Yes.</v>

2219
02:04:42.780 --> 02:04:45.540
That's what's so crazy.
Cause I'm a fucking scientist.

2220
02:04:45.541 --> 02:04:46.950
I don't want to believe that.

2221
02:04:46.951 --> 02:04:50.910
I don't want to believe fucking jungle medicine made me not die.
But this guy,

2222
02:04:50.911 --> 02:04:54.300
here I am,
nobody else fucking affected.
I'm sitting in the fetal position,

2223
02:04:54.301 --> 02:04:56.820
puking my brains out and the guy's going good.
Now you'll be safe.

2224
02:04:56.970 --> 02:04:59.700
And the whole fucking trip,
I've got that in the back of my mind going,

2225
02:04:59.850 --> 02:05:03.150
maybe the whole reason nothing's going wrong is because I just had green fucking

2226
02:05:03.151 --> 02:05:07.710
powder bloat up my nose.
Whoa.
Yeah.
Super Weird.
And I,

2227
02:05:07.890 --> 02:05:09.630
nothing has ever affected me like that.

2228
02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:12.900
I mean curled up puking now was shivering.

2229
02:05:12.930 --> 02:05:16.420
Well you trying to make logical sense out of this.
We try it.

2230
02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:21.720
Was there ever a thought we were like maybe in this extreme environment that's

2231
02:05:21.811 --> 02:05:26.811
so utterly different than any other place in the world that these rules are

2232
02:05:26.971 --> 02:05:31.860
different?
Absolutely.
I mean I,
I'm sitting there going,
going into it.
I'm like,

2233
02:05:31.861 --> 02:05:34.950
cool,
yeah,
I'll do this stupid powder.
If it means I can go on my expedition.

2234
02:05:34.951 --> 02:05:37.380
You know what I mean?
Like I'm not like embracing it.

2235
02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:41.340
I'm just like going through the motion to get my job done as a scientist.

2236
02:05:41.670 --> 02:05:43.230
And then I had this experience,

2237
02:05:43.231 --> 02:05:46.020
and I'm not saying I was enlightened or a woken or anything like that,

2238
02:05:46.290 --> 02:05:51.290
but all of a sudden I attributed my success and my safety in small part to this

2239
02:05:53.940 --> 02:05:57.420
green fucking powder blown up my nose by a shaman throw a monkey bump.

2240
02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:00.960
And the thing about it is,
even if that's not true,

2241
02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:05.990
if you think it's true and then you wind up being okay and you have confidence

2242
02:06:06.330 --> 02:06:10.530
that you're going to be okay and maybe you have less anxiety and make better

2243
02:06:10.531 --> 02:06:13.170
critical decisions because you think that everything's going to work out.

2244
02:06:13.170 --> 02:06:18.080
Exactly.
Exactly.
Totally.
Because I was super focused on my mission,
uh,
we,

2245
02:06:18.100 --> 02:06:22.590
we were very,
very successful in what we set out to do.
And I,

2246
02:06:23.250 --> 02:06:27.450
I feel like because I had that crazy experience and here's this old little

2247
02:06:27.451 --> 02:06:30.990
jungle Indian going,
now you're now you're going to be okay.

2248
02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:35.400
I didn't have any anxiety going into the situation and before that I had no

2249
02:06:35.401 --> 02:06:39.630
thought of it ever playing apart.
Well like the mind fuck of the placebo effect.

2250
02:06:39.631 --> 02:06:41.790
Right?
Totally.
We know that that's real.

2251
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:46.410
So there's a some sort of a physical effect by believing that something works.

2252
02:06:46.430 --> 02:06:48.920
Right.
But is there a physical,

2253
02:06:48.921 --> 02:06:52.110
is there a change in the way you interface with reality,

2254
02:06:52.290 --> 02:06:57.290
if you believe that you've experienced some sort of spiritual enrichening and

2255
02:06:58.921 --> 02:07:02.700
then some sort of,
uh,
some bad spirit has been released from your body?

2256
02:07:02.701 --> 02:07:04.200
Is that possible?
I think so.

2257
02:07:04.530 --> 02:07:08.460
I think it changes your own reality because of your perception of the outside

2258
02:07:08.461 --> 02:07:13.200
world.
That is a freaky thing for a scientist to say.
Right?
And,
and this is like,

2259
02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:17.850
I am a hardcore academic,
I've never considered spirituality,
religion,

2260
02:07:17.851 --> 02:07:18.391
anything.

2261
02:07:18.391 --> 02:07:22.320
And I had this just fucking 10 days ago this crazy experience that has like

2262
02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:24.630
changed my mindset on,
uh,

2263
02:07:25.290 --> 02:07:29.670
on crazy jungle medicine and drugs and catching animals,
everything.

2264
02:07:29.671 --> 02:07:33.210
Because this one guy blew crap up my nose and I puked everywhere.
Wow.
Now,

2265
02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:35.860
has this made you want to experiment with other medicines?

2266
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:37.363
<v 1>No,</v>

2267
02:07:37.460 --> 02:07:42.140
the only reason I did that is because it was a necessity to do what I was doing.

2268
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:44.810
It was coming from an expert,
if you will,

2269
02:07:44.811 --> 02:07:48.740
but a person who saw it as a necessity to do what I was doing and I was under

2270
02:07:48.741 --> 02:07:51.390
his guidance to go out and,
you know,

2271
02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:54.650
pick a mushroom and try it and have an experience is I don't,

2272
02:07:54.800 --> 02:07:56.060
I don't see the benefit in that.

2273
02:07:56.061 --> 02:08:00.380
But when someone who lives in that community embraces that wild jungle says,

2274
02:08:00.381 --> 02:08:02.210
this is my home and this is how you do it,

2275
02:08:02.690 --> 02:08:07.160
<v 0>absolutely do it.
So you do it like out of respect.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

2276
02:08:07.161 --> 02:08:08.990
what if they wanted you out of respect?

2277
02:08:08.991 --> 02:08:12.650
There's a bunch of those different snuffs that they pump up their nose and one

2278
02:08:12.651 --> 02:08:17.420
of them is a,
I think it's,
it's some form of five methoxy dimethyltryptamine,

2279
02:08:17.421 --> 02:08:21.250
which is the stuff that comes off a toads.
Oh,
Gotcha.
Yep.
There's,
there's uh,

2280
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:23.770
and it has a bunch of other stuff in it too.
And they do the same thing.

2281
02:08:23.771 --> 02:08:26.290
That's why I think that one's called a coup.
Hey,
okay.
I'm not a,

2282
02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:28.130
I've read it so I don't know if I'm saying that right.

2283
02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:30.970
That must be a hallucinogenic,
right?
Yeah.
They blow it up your nose and you,

2284
02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:32.720
you see Jesus.
I mean,
look,

2285
02:08:32.721 --> 02:08:37.280
if it was the same situation where he's telling me you got to do this to go to

2286
02:08:37.281 --> 02:08:42.050
work,
do your job,
whatever.
Absolutely I do.
And how to respect when you yes.

2287
02:08:42.080 --> 02:08:47.030
Yeah,
yeah.
I think you kind of have to totally be an asshole.
I mean w w I think,

2288
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:50.050
you know,
when you're in the world of these people and they've,
they,

2289
02:08:50.070 --> 02:08:55.070
they've survived in this world for eons and this is their environment and like

2290
02:08:55.340 --> 02:08:59.250
you kind of kind of have to let go and give in to this.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2291
02:08:59.270 --> 02:09:04.100
You have to embrace it.
Mm Man.
Did you live a fucking cool life?

2292
02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:08.030
It's weird.
It's really cool.
That's really cool.
Well,
thank you for coming here,

2293
02:09:08.031 --> 02:09:11.270
man,
and sharing this stuff with us and thanks for doing what you do.

2294
02:09:11.271 --> 02:09:13.850
It's fucking awesome.
I love it.
It's been an absolute pleasure.

2295
02:09:13.851 --> 02:09:17.840
I've really enjoyed it.
Yeah.
Anytime.
Sweaty,
thinking about all the shit.

2296
02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:19.160
Uh,

2297
02:09:19.160 --> 02:09:23.270
tell people how to get ahold of you on Instagram and Twitter and all that jazz.

2298
02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:28.040
Yup.
Uh,
I'm my name,
Forest Glen,

Goliath Jay.

2300
02:09:28.671 --> 02:09:32.660
I'm on all the social media platforms as it forest dot Galante on Instagram,

2301
02:09:32.700 --> 02:09:35.750
Instagram on the others.
There's no dot.
Um,
