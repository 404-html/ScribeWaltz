00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you have this a desire to like keep upping the ante?</v>

3
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.500
<v Speaker 1>Is that an issue?</v>

4
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.473
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.093
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

6
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:12.421
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

7
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.254
<v Speaker 1>I just like,</v>

8
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>ultimately I just like creating stuff and I liked making videos and I liked</v>

9
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>exploring places.</v>

10
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:18.580
<v Speaker 1>I like heights,</v>

11
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I like jumping between stuff and Latin.</v>

12
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Like the natural progression for me is to,</v>

13
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>is to get higher and things get bigger.</v>

14
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>That's just how it is.</v>

15
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 1>So it just happens but bright.</v>

16
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not thinking about it.</v>

17
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking like,</v>

18
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.941
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

19
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:31.721
<v Speaker 1>I've just released this,</v>

20
00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>so now I need to do something bigger.</v>

21
00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Like it's just there.</v>

22
00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just natural mean.</v>

23
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.140
<v Speaker 1>So how do you go about making a video?</v>

24
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:40.060
<v Speaker 1>If you decide I'm going to make a new video,</v>

25
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>what do you have a thought in your head?</v>

26
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Like I need to get on the Eiffel Tower.</v>

27
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you do it?</v>

28
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>You know what the Eiffel Tower was never,</v>

29
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>never a plan.</v>

30
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:47.794
<v Speaker 1>I never saw.</v>

31
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to Paris and do the Eiffel Tower.</v>

32
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Did you do the Eiffel Tower?</v>

33
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:51.704
<v Speaker 1>The Eiffel Tower?</v>

34
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>So how'd you do it?</v>

35
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.701
<v Speaker 1>If it's not a plan,</v>

36
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:55.241
<v Speaker 1>how'd you do it?</v>

37
00:00:55.241 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>So I was in Denmark just traveling around with a bunch of friends and instead of</v>

38
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>getting in the minivan and driving all the way back to London,</v>

39
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.621
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

40
00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:02.771
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

41
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to sit in a van for 15 hours.</v>

42
00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>Let's just fly somewhere and continue this adventure.</v>

43
00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:12.721
<v Speaker 1>So me and my friend flew to Paris and then the next day we ended up climbing.</v>

44
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:14.074
<v Speaker 1>Now for tower.</v>

45
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this kind of stuff was being done before people were videotaping?</v>

46
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>It must've been.</v>

47
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.363
<v Speaker 1>It must've been.</v>

48
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I feel like for certain people it's just a,</v>

49
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>it's just in them to kind of explore places you shouldn't really explore and I</v>

50
00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>think he's,</v>

51
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

52
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Well for you it seems like something that was fostered though,</v>

53
00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>Because you started off just doing the par course stuff and this became of it.</v>

55
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.961
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

56
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:37.601
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

57
00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

58
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I was annoyed little kid.</v>

59
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.680
<v Speaker 1>I was always to do things I shouldn't.</v>

60
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.523
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

61
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.863
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

62
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

63
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm just a big,</v>

64
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>just a big version of what I was then.</v>

65
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.363
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

66
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

67
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 2>some pretty cool videos.</v>

68
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 2>If you look up on youtube of like urban exploration or people were finding weird</v>

69
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.190
<v Speaker 2>pathways and like,</v>

70
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh shit,</v>

71
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:58.170
<v Speaker 2>looked on 60 feet underground,</v>

72
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 2>we made it and there's this shit that's been buried under here.</v>

73
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Wonder why it's buried and look old electronics and stuff like that.</v>

74
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.880
<v Speaker 2>Like under like uncovering the hatch and lost.</v>

75
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 2>So it'll sort of like that.</v>

76
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:08.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

77
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:09.314
<v Speaker 2>I can find this stuff like,</v>

78
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:09.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

79
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>well that's,</v>

80
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.230
<v Speaker 1>that's very interesting to me.</v>

81
00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:16.231
<v Speaker 1>But what I'm really most fascinated by is this willingness to put your life in</v>

82
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:17.950
<v Speaker 1>mortal danger</v>

83
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>and that how exciting this is for people to watch.</v>

84
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the most viewed video that you have?</v>

85
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 1>How many hits does it have?</v>

86
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.511
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

87
00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>I think just over 4 million.</v>

88
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.820
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking people.</v>

89
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.693
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.800
<v Speaker 1>This one's got a few million.</v>

91
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I think this is you.</v>

92
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.843
<v Speaker 1>You get,</v>

93
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.731
<v Speaker 1>so we climbed it.</v>

94
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>We went,</v>

95
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.230
<v Speaker 1>we just pushed it too far.</v>

96
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>Like we went up to the very top platform.</v>

97
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.813
<v Speaker 1>If you've been to Paris,</v>

98
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

99
00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>it didn't say off the top.</v>

100
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 1>So you can take the lift up,</v>

101
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

102
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.181
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

103
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:47.851
<v Speaker 1>you can walk.</v>

104
00:02:47.851 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Can you take the stairs to the second platform?</v>

105
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:51.230
<v Speaker 1>That's the highest you can take the stairs too.</v>

106
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>There is stairs to the top,</v>

107
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>but they don't allow it because they're like weird and narrow.</v>

108
00:02:55.161 --> 00:03:00.161
<v Speaker 1>And so you take the lift to the top and then there's like a door that's manned</v>

109
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>by a security card that is the door to that staircase.</v>

110
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>And that's where we came up from the backside.</v>

111
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

112
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>we went up and for some reason we just had the urge to just go inside even</v>

113
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>though it's lit up,</v>

114
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>even though there's cameras everywhere.</v>

115
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.811
<v Speaker 1>We opened that door,</v>

116
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I step in to the top platform and then I just hear this,</v>

117
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>this walkie talkie just go like,</v>

118
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

119
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>like you go crazy and French.</v>

120
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.081
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

121
00:03:23.081 --> 00:03:23.914
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

122
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>we've definitely been seen less disappears.</v>

123
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And then we ran down,</v>

124
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>we climbed out of the staircase and then on each,</v>

125
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>on opposite corners of the tower in the main beams,</v>

126
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>there's like kind of like a little pocket inside the beam that you can jump</v>

127
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>

128
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>It must be like two by two.</v>

129
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Like size.</v>

130
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I barely fit into it,</v>

131
00:03:44.531 --> 00:03:44.711
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

132
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:45.544
<v Speaker 1>Cause I'm huge.</v>

133
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>My friend is small.</v>

134
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>So you just like,</v>

135
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Brooke disappeared into this hole and then we sat on opposite ends of the tower</v>

136
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>and hid and the lifts.</v>

137
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You start hearing lifts coming,</v>

138
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:55.061
<v Speaker 1>you're up,</v>

139
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:57.990
<v Speaker 1>you start hearing people running up and down the stairs you see taught is</v>

140
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>everything's kicking off and we're hitting these little holes</v>

141
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>and they're searching for us and I'm just like hiding in this hole and I'm like,</v>

142
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>I've got one shoe off because it wouldn't fit in.</v>

143
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I've got my knee wrestling on my shoe,</v>

144
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>I've lost all feeling in my leg because the blood circulation has gone.</v>

145
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>My head's sticking out the top and I've got like my tee shirt over my head,</v>

146
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>like a little Ninja and there's people with torches going up and down looking</v>

147
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:24.004
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>

148
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.130
<v Speaker 1>So do you have video,</v>

149
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>that little pocket that you were in?</v>

150
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

151
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.780
<v Speaker 1>in this now I do have is only on two sides of the tower,</v>

152
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:35.614
<v Speaker 1>which is strange,</v>

153
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of similar to this gap here.</v>

154
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.641
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

155
00:04:37.641 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

156
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.491
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

157
00:04:38.491 --> 00:04:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I see on the right,</v>

158
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 1>it's in that corner there and it's like a foot and a half by a foot.</v>

159
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:43.301
<v Speaker 1>And a half.</v>

160
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>I think I barely fit in.</v>

161
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.840
<v Speaker 1>So how long did they wait?</v>

162
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>So we were in the [inaudible] coming up right now.</v>

163
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

164
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>This is what it was starting to open up.</v>

165
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>This was like as we,</v>

166
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 1>so this is like right where as here,</v>

167
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:55.414
<v Speaker 1>just before we go.</v>

168
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

169
00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>So we've tucked in,</v>

170
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>this was just before we got caught.</v>

171
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So how'd you get caught?</v>

172
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Because the lifts start coming up cause the staff start coming up to work or to</v>

173
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:07.660
<v Speaker 1>clean or something and they just saw us.</v>

174
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>We're just like running around these beams and there's lifts everywhere.</v>

175
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>So what happens then?</v>

176
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>So with like,</v>

177
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 1>so we're still in this hole and we sit in this whole for like two hours,</v>

178
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>at least two hours where they're going up and down.</v>

179
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:21.521
<v Speaker 1>It goes quiet.</v>

180
00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped out of the hole.</v>

181
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>I have a look around,</v>

182
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.561
<v Speaker 1>I go and see Stevie.</v>

183
00:05:24.561 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>Stevie's like half asleep,</v>

184
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>just chilling in the hole and then</v>

185
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.210
<v Speaker 1>come back to the whole.</v>

186
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:31.481
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

187
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:31.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

188
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>this seems like pretty clear now.</v>

189
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I think they must've thought that we jumped off with parachutes and we,</v>

190
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.220
<v Speaker 1>because they couldn't find us.</v>

191
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.451
<v Speaker 1>And then I was like,</v>

192
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:40.631
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

193
00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:40.881
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

194
00:05:40.881 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>this seems pretty clear.</v>

195
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:45.100
<v Speaker 1>And then every single light on the tower,</v>

196
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>because the whole thing lights up.</v>

197
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't like the twinkly lights that they have on every hour at night.</v>

198
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>This is like internal lights that are like this big,</v>

199
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>like the whole fucking tower up.</v>

200
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped straight back into the hole.</v>

201
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what's going on.</v>

202
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>And then lifts again,</v>

203
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>people up and down the stairs again looking for us.</v>

204
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>So when we sat in these homes again for ages</v>

205
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.163
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

206
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>and then it finally goes quiet,</v>

207
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>but the lights are still on for a little while and then the whole thing just</v>

208
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 1>shuts down and that,</v>

209
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that was it.</v>

210
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.541
<v Speaker 1>So I jumped out,</v>

211
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.374
<v Speaker 1>I had a look around,</v>

212
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>went and got Stevie and then it was ours again.</v>

213
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>And then we were up there until like 9:00 AM I think it was.</v>

214
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>How long was that?</v>

215
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:29.623
<v Speaker 1>How many hours?</v>

216
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>A 1:00 AM til 9:00 AM.</v>

217
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

218
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 1>So you were climbing around and I think for eight fucking hours,</v>

219
00:06:35.151 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>that's nuts.</v>

220
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>Running that French chocolate Barb.</v>

221
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.553
<v Speaker 1>She's really good.</v>

222
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.941
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

223
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:41.521
<v Speaker 1>that's all you eat.</v>

224
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:42.111
<v Speaker 1>It's all we had.</v>

225
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:42.944
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

226
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>So he came down because you were hungry.</v>

227
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>We came down cause we got caught now.</v>

228
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.970
<v Speaker 1>And so you would have stayed there for the rest of the day.</v>

229
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

230
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

231
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.010
<v Speaker 1>the idea was to like wait till it opened and then get into a place where you</v>

232
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>could hide like near the second platform and then just drop into the second</v>

233
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:01.670
<v Speaker 1>platform and just merge in with like the tourists.</v>

234
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>But we didn't get that far.</v>

235
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>That would have been calm.</v>

236
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.710
<v Speaker 1>So the plan was to wait for it to open and sneak out with the crowd.</v>

237
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Just jumped out of the beam into the crowd,</v>

238
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.130
<v Speaker 1>disappears into a lift.</v>

239
00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:13.341
<v Speaker 1>Done.</v>

240
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:14.540
<v Speaker 1>So when you get caught,</v>

241
00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Speaker 1>then what happens?</v>

242
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 1>So we got seen by like a big group of people in,</v>

243
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 1>in one of the lifts and we were just like waving.</v>

244
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

245
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

246
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.670
<v Speaker 1>like angry looking people,</v>

247
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>but like angry people and happy people.</v>

248
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:27.891
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

249
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>what the heck's going on?</v>

250
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.983
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

251
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

252
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>we would like to above slightly above and maintenance platform where they have</v>

253
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>like lifts that take workers up.</v>

254
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

255
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.510
<v Speaker 1>so we had to climb down and we met people on the maintenance platform getting</v>

256
00:07:41.511 --> 00:07:41.900
<v Speaker 1>the left.</v>

257
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>There's like five of us,</v>

258
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.440
<v Speaker 1>like to me and Stevie and they're like few other people,</v>

259
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:46.161
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>

260
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 1>just like private security for the tower.</v>

261
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And then we come down to the basement lifts open.</v>

262
00:07:51.701 --> 00:07:56.701
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a room full of policemen and we're like go see in the movie.</v>

263
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 1>And when they do that bit,</v>

264
00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I had to hide every single SD card and everything that I had on me.</v>

265
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.631
<v Speaker 1>How'd you do that?</v>

266
00:08:05.631 --> 00:08:06.401
<v Speaker 1>Three kinds of people.</v>

267
00:08:06.401 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

268
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

269
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.563
<v Speaker 1>it was an option.</v>

270
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 1>That was the only option.</v>

271
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:10.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

272
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had to do that yet.</v>

273
00:08:13.101 --> 00:08:14.180
<v Speaker 1>But he had a condom.</v>

274
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>You tie it in and not put them in the condom,</v>

275
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.051
<v Speaker 1>put your finger up,</v>

276
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>move on.</v>

277
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:19.060
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

278
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:19.301
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

279
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:20.240
<v Speaker 1>So how do you,</v>

280
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

281
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.590
<v Speaker 1>hide the SD cards?</v>

282
00:08:21.591 --> 00:08:21.741
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

283
00:08:21.741 --> 00:08:23.050
<v Speaker 1>they must've went through your stuff for the flight.</v>

284
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.581
<v Speaker 1>I thought they would,</v>

285
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:26.414
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't.</v>

286
00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.423
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

287
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Paris,</v>

288
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.731
<v Speaker 1>they don't give a fuck,</v>

289
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>they're turning delayed drink wine.</v>

290
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Chocolate had like a big five d like a big DSLR.</v>

291
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:37.961
<v Speaker 1>And then I had I think two GoPros and so to Mike arrestees and one like CF card</v>

292
00:08:38.381 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>from the,</v>

293
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.553
<v Speaker 1>from the big one.</v>

294
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>And I had like this bag that I had like little tiny pen pockets,</v>

295
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.310
<v Speaker 1>like really thin pockets.</v>

296
00:08:46.311 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

297
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.240
<v Speaker 1>And I just stuffed the mark cresty cause down there and I had like a,</v>

298
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>a little rip in the back padding of the bag.</v>

299
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So I just threw the CF card in the back of the bag and it just fell down and I</v>

300
00:08:58.201 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>just hoped.</v>

301
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And then when we got to the police station,</v>

302
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.270
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

303
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 1>you have so many cameras on you,</v>

304
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 1>clearly you've been filming.</v>

305
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

306
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:08.453
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

307
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I forgot the SD cards.</v>

308
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Cameras died.</v>

309
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.113
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

310
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>they believed that I had to surrender everything on my phone.</v>

311
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.533
<v Speaker 1>I um,</v>

312
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>he had to surrender everything on your phone.</v>

313
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:19.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

314
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

315
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>so I had three cameras,</v>

316
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:20.971
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

317
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

318
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.040
<v Speaker 1>I had three cameras and my phone,</v>

319
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:23.321
<v Speaker 1>so I like,</v>

320
00:09:23.321 --> 00:09:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to give something up to try and save the most valuable,</v>

321
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.220
<v Speaker 1>the most valuable footage.</v>

322
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

323
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:31.531
<v Speaker 1>they were like,</v>

324
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 1>did you feel most like only filmed in my phone because my camera's died and I</v>

325
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:35.640
<v Speaker 1>forgot my SD cards.</v>

326
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.780
<v Speaker 1>And then they went through like the footage on the phone just made me delete.</v>

327
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Oh that's cool.</v>

328
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:40.701
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

329
00:09:40.701 --> 00:09:42.990
<v Speaker 1>the footage and the phone was like a ruse.</v>

330
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>The footage on the phone was like me in the,</v>

331
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 1>in the little hole filming,</v>

332
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 1>talking to the camera and like filming the people looking cause I was like this</v>

333
00:09:51.301 --> 00:09:52.390
<v Speaker 1>and I put my phone out.</v>

334
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

335
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 1>That you had something to give them.</v>

336
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

337
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

338
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens?</v>

339
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.200
<v Speaker 1>How long did they detain you?</v>

340
00:09:58.290 --> 00:09:58.561
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

341
00:09:58.561 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 1>we were there for like eight hours,</v>

342
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:01.790
<v Speaker 1>so another eight hours hours.</v>

343
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.050
<v Speaker 1>So when you're eight hours up there climbing around,</v>

344
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:04.913
<v Speaker 1>how do you pee?</v>

345
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:07.110
<v Speaker 1>You pee off the edge of the town.</v>

346
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

347
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:12.030
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why I got arrested person on his French people as if life throws</v>

348
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:13.080
<v Speaker 1>and clicked on them enough.</v>

349
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.951
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

350
00:10:13.951 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I think by the time it gets to the ground,</v>

351
00:10:15.391 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of all spread out and we're not,</v>

352
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 1>or it's a fucking raging river of piss around on some little Old Lady's head.</v>

353
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 1>It seems like if you were just pee on the tower that way it dribbles down</v>

355
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:27.421
<v Speaker 1>slowly.</v>

356
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hit anybody in the head.</v>

357
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were still on the Eiffel Tower and you needed to pay and there was</v>

358
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 1>no one below you because it's like 4:00 AM oh okay.</v>

359
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 1>You'd pay off the edge.</v>

360
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you don't know how much that's even ruder.</v>

361
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:38.971
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

362
00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Tough enough person.</v>

363
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.830
<v Speaker 1>If I did peel on them,</v>

364
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a romantic couple going for a walk,</v>

365
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:44.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would have really worked out.</v>

366
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.220
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden the girl goes to the lighter cigarette and you piss running her</v>

367
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 1>head and she gets mad and the fucking evening ends poorly and they could have,</v>

368
00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 1>it could have been a perfect relationship,</v>

369
00:10:53.641 --> 00:10:54.300
<v Speaker 1>but you ruined it.</v>

370
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.133
<v Speaker 1>I killed it.</v>

371
00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:59.130
<v Speaker 1>So he come down and then another eight hours of detention.</v>

372
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

373
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 1>And what do they do to you?</v>

374
00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Handcuffed us to a chair.</v>

375
00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.810
<v Speaker 1>We just sat in the middle of the,</v>

376
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.280
<v Speaker 1>of this police station.</v>

377
00:11:06.281 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>There's like sales behind us with people going crazy and like people bleeding</v>

378
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:11.580
<v Speaker 1>from the eyeballs.</v>

379
00:11:11.581 --> 00:11:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And we just sat there like people bleeding from their eyeballs,</v>

380
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 1>from other crimes,</v>

381
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.020
<v Speaker 1>like nighttime fights and stuff like that and just drunk people.</v>

382
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And we would just sat there for ages.</v>

383
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>And then we finally got taken into like separate rooms where we were questioned</v>

384
00:11:24.571 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 1>by some high up.</v>

385
00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:26.941
<v Speaker 1>I had a woman,</v>

386
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:31.800
<v Speaker 1>he had a dude and we were both questions for a couple of hours and then we were</v>

387
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.110
<v Speaker 1>back out handcuffed to the chairs again.</v>

388
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.690
<v Speaker 1>And then they took all of our stuff and they searched it.</v>

389
00:11:36.691 --> 00:11:37.480
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

390
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:37.770
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

391
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.670
<v Speaker 1>if they find it,</v>

392
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.470
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be like,</v>

393
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:40.741
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

394
00:11:40.741 --> 00:11:42.480
<v Speaker 1>you just told us that you feel nothing.</v>

395
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And we've just found hours and hours of footage,</v>

396
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 1>like what's the deal?</v>

397
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>

398
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.953
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

399
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.793
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

400
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:50.430
<v Speaker 1>no cards.</v>

401
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

402
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.200
<v Speaker 1>And then um,</v>

403
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.110
<v Speaker 1>they finally brought the,</v>

404
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.101
<v Speaker 1>brought the bags back.</v>

405
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 1>Like it must've been an hour.</v>

406
00:11:55.031 --> 00:11:55.864
<v Speaker 1>They had them for,</v>

407
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>and I thought they were going to go through everything,</v>

408
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but they brought it back.</v>

409
00:11:59.501 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 1>I checked it and I was like,</v>

410
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.263
<v Speaker 1>stomach,</v>

411
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 1>the gods are still here.</v>

412
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.633
<v Speaker 1>And then we just like,</v>

413
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:04.601
<v Speaker 1>we just lost it.</v>

414
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:05.291
<v Speaker 1>We were so happy.</v>

415
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:06.820
<v Speaker 1>But the policemen,</v>

416
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea what we were doing.</v>

417
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>So do they kick you out of the country?</v>

418
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:12.240
<v Speaker 1>They had no record.</v>

419
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:13.121
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

420
00:12:13.121 --> 00:12:13.390
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

421
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:15.250
<v Speaker 1>so I had to go back in that room.</v>

422
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.440
<v Speaker 1>I had to sign an agreement that said,</v>

423
00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I promise I will not climb the Eiffel Tower for three years.</v>

424
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:22.241
<v Speaker 1>For three years.</v>

425
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:22.840
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

426
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:23.321
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

427
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

428
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:23.981
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

429
00:12:23.981 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 1>a magnum,</v>

430
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.233
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

431
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 1>How can they only give you how come out?</v>

432
00:12:27.131 --> 00:12:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll take forever.</v>

433
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:28.661
<v Speaker 1>Ever.</v>

434
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:29.494
<v Speaker 1>I</v>

435
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.780
<v Speaker 1>think they must like it.</v>

436
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

437
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

438
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.110
<v Speaker 1>You're a woman that was interviewing me.</v>

439
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.953
<v Speaker 1>He loved it.</v>

440
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.501
<v Speaker 1>She did.</v>

441
00:12:35.501 --> 00:12:36.334
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

442
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.050
<v Speaker 1>you really shouldn't be doing this,</v>

443
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:39.870
<v Speaker 1>but how did you do this?</v>

444
00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.753
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

445
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 1>Like she loved it.</v>

446
00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:42.560
<v Speaker 1>Why Oak?</v>

447
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.091
<v Speaker 1>He loved it.</v>

448
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

449
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:43.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

450
00:12:43.661 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I think once they realize that you're polite,</v>

451
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.320
<v Speaker 1>you're gentleman,</v>

452
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.320
<v Speaker 1>you're a very nice guy,</v>

453
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:48.710
<v Speaker 1>you're just a thrill seeker.</v>

454
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.911
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

455
00:12:48.911 --> 00:12:49.060
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

456
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>this is not a threat to society,</v>

457
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.761
<v Speaker 1>skies,</v>

458
00:12:51.761 --> 00:12:52.600
<v Speaker 1>and a terrorist.</v>

459
00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:54.850
<v Speaker 1>So the second question she asked me was,</v>

461
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.140
<v Speaker 1>did you leave a bomb up there?</v>

462
00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

463
00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:57.821
<v Speaker 1>And I just laughed.</v>

464
00:12:57.821 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

465
00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:58.990
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

466
00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.823
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

467
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

468
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

469
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.680
<v Speaker 1>that's something that they have to take any consideration.</v>

470
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:03.670
<v Speaker 1>They have to actually trust you.</v>

471
00:13:03.671 --> 00:13:03.941
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

472
00:13:03.941 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 1>If they let you go,</v>

473
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.550
<v Speaker 1>it turns out you did leave a bottom up,</v>

474
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.393
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

475
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:08.441
<v Speaker 1>Then they have to,</v>

476
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:08.680
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

477
00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>they would have to comb over the building with a fine tooth comb.</v>

478
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to say he's going to be like,</v>

479
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:13.150
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

480
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you know what I did?</v>

481
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:15.543
<v Speaker 1>I left the boom up there.</v>

482
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.971
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

483
00:13:15.971 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 1>no one would write.</v>

484
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.760
<v Speaker 1>So they really have to trust you.</v>

485
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

486
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Europeans.</v>

487
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:22.383
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous,</v>

488
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.220
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous people.</v>

489
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.113
<v Speaker 1>Three years.</v>

490
00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:25.761
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

491
00:13:25.761 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 1>You throw me in jail forever.</v>

492
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.061
<v Speaker 1>It was America.</v>

493
00:13:28.061 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 1>They put you right in Guantanamo Bay.</v>

494
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.740
<v Speaker 1>They throw a dog in there with you.</v>

495
00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.083
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

496
00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:40.590
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
