00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches when all that shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>went down with Chris Kyle in the car and</v>

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>when he said that he punched you in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bar and get you sued the family like,</v>

3
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.074
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't choose.</v>

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>The family sued him rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

6
00:00:15.601 --> 00:00:20.601
<v Speaker 1>I shooed him and he died and then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot automatically goes to his estate.</v>

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>That's the way the legal works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was never in any jeopardy because in</v>

8
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>any writers contract you have insurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the publisher,</v>

9
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>so it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They portrayed and I became the villain</v>

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.300
<v Speaker 1>going after the widow and the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

11
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the biggest lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big insurance company that's</v>

12
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>covering the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not out a panty and they won't</v>

13
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:45.870
<v Speaker 1>be out a panel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to explain that I'm sure over</v>

14
00:00:45.871 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>and over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

15
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the tie,</v>

16
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>the trial got overturned because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance came out,</v>

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>so it's okay to lie in court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the truth comes out,</v>

18
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>you can get a new trial.</v>

19
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>The insurance came out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean in court?</v>

20
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to say that insurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>is paying for everything,</v>

21
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 1>even though it's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to say that in court.</v>

22
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when you say it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>court?</v>

23
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came out and the judge allowed it to</v>

24
00:01:09.991 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>eliminate it degree and then the appeals</v>
<v Speaker 1>court ruled that the judge shouldn't</v>

25
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>have did that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because having the judge say that it</v>

26
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>sways people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they think that a fine tool against</v>

27
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>the insurance companies because</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance companies a big,</v>

28
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>even though the other side is doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called poor mouth thing,</v>

29
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>they're getting up and saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxing them financially and lying</v>

30
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>insurance is paying for all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get up and lie about it.</v>

31
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>So the other side was saying this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to devastate our family reality.</v>

32
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to influence the.</v>

33
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>And in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me state this.</v>

34
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>How overwhelming must be evidence of Ben</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the jury to go against the grieving</v>

35
00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>widow of the dead war veteran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>It must be pretty overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evidence was overwhelming.</v>

37
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

38
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>the jury went from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came for me.</v>

39
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>They said he was lied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This didn't happen and we're awarding.</v>

40
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think he did that?</v>

41
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Did you know him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

42
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 1>You didn't know him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

43
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean I didn't know even how he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing happened.</v>

44
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>We were there on the same nights we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>at [inaudible] because I was there for a</v>

45
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>graduation of class 2:58 AM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>class 58.</v>

46
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>It's traditionally every hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

47
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>If you can you come back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduation.</v>

48
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>So class 2:58 was graduating the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>day on Friday I came out along with my</v>

49
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:43.191
<v Speaker 1>teammates from class 58 to attend that</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduation the next day.</v>

50
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>So why would I say bad things about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>seals if I'm there?</v>

51
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said he punched me for</v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell because people don't know what</v>

52
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about because probably a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people listening to this have no</v>

53
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>idea what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me just fill my real quick.</v>

54
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

55
00:02:57.841 --> 00:03:02.841
<v Speaker 1>the book American sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie with Bradley Cooper was just</v>

56
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>giant hit movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very patriotic movie about a guy who was</v>

57
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the most successful snipers in US</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

58
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very successful warrior,</v>

59
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>navy seal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war hero.</v>

60
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loved him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he goes on the opiod,</v>

61
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Show and he says that he punched</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out.</v>

62
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.240
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a chapter in his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

63
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>Where he writes that he called me scruff</v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

64
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you said that I said scheels</v>

65
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.790
<v Speaker 1>deserved to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in other words,</v>

66
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>she accused me of treason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

67
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And I was out there for a seal</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduation.</v>

68
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>If I felt that way about my old unit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I be attending?</v>

69
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.490
<v Speaker 1>So he wrote in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave you a nickname in the book,</v>

70
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>scruff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

71
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>whoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he might not have.</v>

72
00:03:47.321 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Even when he wrote it in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might not have even thought that he</v>

73
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>was going to give that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>who knows what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My thought was at the time I was trying</v>

75
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>to wrap my head around why anybody would</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this.</v>

76
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was thinking,</v>

77
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>well maybe he's just trying to generate</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much controversy as possible to</v>

78
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>generate as much income as possible from</v>
<v Speaker 1>his book.</v>

79
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>And it just got out of hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

80
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I was trying to put it together</v>

81
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>because there was a couple of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>fabrications,</v>

82
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>

83
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shooting at a gas station that never</v>

84
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:15.484
<v Speaker 1>took place.</v>

85
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.940
<v Speaker 1>And he said that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during Katrina he was on the people who</v>

86
00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>were looting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

87
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>That was disturbing because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder.</v>

88
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also lied about his medals.</v>

89
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>The navy had to come out and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

90
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 1>He said he had two silver stars and five</v>
<v Speaker 1>bronze stars.</v>

91
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.440
<v Speaker 1>He had won silver star and three bronze</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>

92
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>So he lied about three medals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In three is impressive enough.</v>

94
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

95
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>And then they try to give them an excuse</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

96
00:04:44.231 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was confused.</v>

97
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:46.444
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

98
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.560
<v Speaker 1>When you get a medal like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like graduating from college.</v>

99
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 1>They give you a certificate that puts on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wall if you win the bronze star,</v>

100
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>the silver star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a,</v>

101
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>as an seal yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he threw me under the bus.</v>

102
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>What does that feel like to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is obviously,</v>

103
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>this is something that's very near and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear to your heart who hugely.</v>

104
00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 1>He has made it to where I can't go to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reunion anymore.</v>

105
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.520
<v Speaker 1>There were 170 seals that wanted me</v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of the Udt Seal Association</v>

106
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.820
<v Speaker 1>over his lie</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the lives of his buddies who came up</v>

107
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>and tried to testify for them so it got</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing.</v>

108
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.860
<v Speaker 1>His trial said that it actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

109
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't say it,</v>

110
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>but they tried to say everything else to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it seem like it did well.</v>

111
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>How the hell they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well because they danced around the</v>

112
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 1>questions and the lawyer rang and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to piece together.</v>

113
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't one witness that saw me get</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit and there wasn't one witness that</v>

114
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 1>heard me say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See attributed to me and weren't you</v>

115
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 1>visible the next day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No photographs that night.</v>

116
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Them posing for pictures with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had said all this stuff,</v>

117
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 1>why would they have take pictures with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>

118
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.270
<v Speaker 1>What is that feeling like when someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>just fucking lies horrible and when it</v>

119
00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>makes about a terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

120
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>and what's worse about it is the media</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumps on it and convicts me of it</v>

121
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>because why they broke the story when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>went off the grid,</v>

122
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Mexico where I couldn't even come back.</v>

123
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>So they broke the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they knew?</v>

124
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm starting to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why didn't it happen on the opiod</v>

125
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Anthony Show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 1>but that don't think that was planned</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know those guys.</v>

127
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the whole ball.</v>

128
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>They all show did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it that day on O'reilly later</v>

129
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 1>that afternoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he wants.</v>

130
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 1>He named you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just start naming you ever.</v>

131
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:43.550
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it went viral.</v>

132
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It went viral and everyone convicted me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they said,</v>

133
00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Iraq war veteran wouldn't lie.</v>

134
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just watched a.</v>

135
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you all that.</v>

136
00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>It's destroyed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get hired for a job during my</v>

137
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.110
<v Speaker 1>trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After it was over,</v>

138
00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 1>guess what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty four major media conglomerates</v>

139
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>entered the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

140
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.983
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.050
<v Speaker 1>the trial with that Ama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ama.</v>

142
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it or whatever have of</v>

143
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>influencing the court of appeals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overturn my verdict and they did it.</v>

144
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Thirty four media conglomerates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New York Times,</v>

145
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 1>The Washington Post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these media conglomerates appeal</v>

146
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>to the Court of Appeals to overturn my</v>
<v Speaker 1>verdict,</v>

147
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:34.190
<v Speaker 1>but why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I won on something called unjust</v>

148
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 1>enrichment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want the ability to be able to</v>

149
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 1>defame you and profit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

150
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>I'll put it what they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what these judges accommodated them with</v>

151
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be another trial.</v>

152
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:47.590
<v Speaker 1>They've ordered a new trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

153
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.160
<v Speaker 1>so I got to go through it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad because when it comes out</v>

154
00:07:52.161 --> 00:07:57.161
<v Speaker 1>to juries and judges find kyle guilty</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's not going to believe it then and.</v>

155
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:02.840
<v Speaker 1>But the point is they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've ordered a new trial.</v>

156
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 1>They've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dis.</v>

157
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>They throughout the whole verdict of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>jury,</v>

158
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.600
<v Speaker 1>the federal judge who wrote substantial</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence supporting the jury's verdict.</v>

159
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>They did all that and they violated</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own rules.</v>

160
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>A 76 year rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's what it states if,</v>

161
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.680
<v Speaker 1>because it happened during summation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the judge allowed it in the.</v>

162
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>My attorney it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ended up for questions in an 11 day</v>

163
00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 1>trial and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a page of a 20 page summary and it was</v>

164
00:08:32.901 --> 00:08:37.901
<v Speaker 1>overturned on that and they overturned</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because they felt that it was undue</v>

165
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>influence on the jury that they found</v>
<v Speaker 1>out that insurance was paying for</v>

166
00:08:42.231 --> 00:08:44.590
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so was one factor.</v>

167
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here's the deal.</v>

168
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.850
<v Speaker 1>If the rules state that if in final</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument they say something,</v>

169
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>you must object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must object.</v>

170
00:08:56.191 --> 00:09:01.191
<v Speaker 1>So the trial lawyer as a chance to rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>during final argument and the jury has a</v>

171
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>chance to hear the ruling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never objected,</v>

172
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:09.141
<v Speaker 1>so they must object to undue influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fact that it was never</v>

173
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never objected.</v>

174
00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.720
<v Speaker 1>The jury was dismissed at 1158 at 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

175
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then objected.</v>

176
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>The judge overruled them and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>done with it.</v>

177
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two judges,</v>

178
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:27.621
<v Speaker 1>Riley and shepherd have now overturned</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case on something that was never</v>

179
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 1>objected to in trial.</v>

180
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>They objected to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they overturned the jury and the</v>

181
00:09:33.661 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>federal judge them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also overturned my unjust</v>

182
00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:40.770
<v Speaker 1>enrichment claim because the media</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want it.</v>

183
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.100
<v Speaker 1>What they've allowed now is the media</v>
<v Speaker 1>can defame you and profit from it and</v>

184
00:09:47.101 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>you can't get any of their profits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how they harm you,</v>

185
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.910
<v Speaker 1>while that's the equivalent of if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>went out and robbed the bank and they</v>

186
00:09:56.911 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 1>caught you and they shouldn't and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>a two years in prison for the bank</v>

187
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 1>robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you get out,</v>

188
00:10:02.431 --> 00:10:07.431
<v Speaker 1>you get to keep all the money you took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's in this particular case,</v>

189
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:12.430
<v Speaker 1>this particular which will now be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard they ruled that way,</v>

190
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 1>they now make it to where you can profit</v>
<v Speaker 1>from wrongdoing because of this case.</v>

191
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.730
<v Speaker 1>This is such a touchy case because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>so indicative of the complications of</v>

192
00:10:24.731 --> 00:10:28.550
<v Speaker 1>people because people are not simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really varied.</v>

193
00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Archie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lied.</v>

194
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.120
<v Speaker 1>He did lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any harm to be with his lie that,</v>

195
00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:37.690
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's complicated is he's also the</v>

196
00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:42.691
<v Speaker 1>subject of this gigantic movie and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol of patriotism where so many</v>

197
00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:45.370
<v Speaker 1>people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle,</v>

198
00:10:45.371 --> 00:10:47.690
<v Speaker 1>rest in peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many people would have.</v>

199
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:52.190
<v Speaker 1>I saw a cloud that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone took a photo in the cloud and</v>

200
00:10:52.191 --> 00:10:53.980
<v Speaker 1>that's on a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Chris.</v>

201
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Chris Kyle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like a sniper in the car in.</v>

202
00:10:56.681 --> 00:11:00.490
<v Speaker 1>This is Chris Kyle guiding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarding the skies.</v>

203
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Like it became a meme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he became this thing where he</v>

204
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.540
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a representative of the brave</v>

205
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:09.490
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the portrayal,</v>

206
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:12.730
<v Speaker 1>but honestly the betrayal that Bradley</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooper played in that movie,</v>

207
00:11:12.731 --> 00:11:17.070
<v Speaker 1>that movie was so simplistic and so it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

208
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It was like right out of the Joseph</v>
<v Speaker 1>Campbell Hero's journey.</v>

209
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Had I not gone to court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been in the movie.</v>

210
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop it.</v>

211
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.640
<v Speaker 1>They were going to have him punch you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie,</v>

212
00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:33.430
<v Speaker 1>the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

213
00:11:33.431 --> 00:11:36.290
<v Speaker 1>And I had to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know when we were.</v>

214
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:38.950
<v Speaker 1>When we were in trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what they tried to do to</v>

215
00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:43.690
<v Speaker 1>diminish my role because when they knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were gonna lose their lawyer got me</v>

216
00:11:43.691 --> 00:11:45.940
<v Speaker 1>on the stand and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Ventura.</v>

217
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.960
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it surprise you to know that the</v>

218
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 1>first draft of the doesn't have you in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

219
00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Trying to prove how insignificant my</v>
<v Speaker 1>first draft of the movie.</v>

220
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:01.560
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

221
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.240
<v Speaker 1>the first draft of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

222
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.460
<v Speaker 1>but so what if the second draft as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>it though?</v>

223
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's where my response.</v>

224
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

225
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't surprise me at all because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said we've sent two letters to warner</v>

226
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 1>brothers warning them that if I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed in in this movie,</v>

227
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:19.150
<v Speaker 1>they will be next to be sued.</v>

228
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.720
<v Speaker 1>So we put Warner Brothers on notice that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is included in your movie,</v>

229
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 1>you will get sued next and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out here,</v>

230
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:33.580
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to step into a lawsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing that kept me from</v>

231
00:12:33.581 --> 00:12:38.170
<v Speaker 1>being punched out in that movie and</v>
<v Speaker 1>portrayed me as a villain in that</v>

232
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 1>frickin movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never seen them fill in way more</v>

233
00:12:41.261 --> 00:12:42.070
<v Speaker 1>than a villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

234
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.780
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that is insane.</v>

235
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 1>It is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what's.</v>

236
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.820
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy to me and what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated about this is that there are</v>

237
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of brave men and</v>
<v Speaker 1>women who have risked their lives,</v>

238
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:58.501
<v Speaker 1>sacrificed their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy becomes this this way,</v>

239
00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.610
<v Speaker 1>and when he rises above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including me,</v>

240
00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.870
<v Speaker 1>including you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

241
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.830
<v Speaker 1>very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he rises above all this and becomes</v>

242
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:10.870
<v Speaker 1>this icon figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

243
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.890
<v Speaker 1>This iconic figure that you can't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tarnish and then the truth is irrelevant</v>

244
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:19.300
<v Speaker 1>and they're willing to sacrifice people</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you and the truth just for this</v>

245
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.580
<v Speaker 1>overall image of patriotism.</v>

246
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:23.740
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

247
00:13:23.741 --> 00:13:26.920
<v Speaker 1>What a crazy place that must've been for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still is.</v>

248
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know that this person that I told</v>

249
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:32.950
<v Speaker 1>you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the seizures,</v>

250
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.090
<v Speaker 1>that she's your disorder started right</v>
<v Speaker 1>after this.</v>

251
00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:42.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that the doctors have said</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's yours can be caused by stress.</v>

252
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:49.710
<v Speaker 1>So I hold Chris Kyle directly</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the seizure disorder.</v>

253
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 1>All showed that I had to face that</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana cured.</v>

254
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever communicate with him face</v>
<v Speaker 1>to face?</v>

255
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.770
<v Speaker 1>Only one shot the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

256
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:59.140
<v Speaker 1>when we first and June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even know who he was.</v>

257
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 1>And then in June of 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the book came out in January,</v>

258
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a settlement conference where he</v>

259
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:10.210
<v Speaker 1>kept saying that if he met me in person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could work it out,</v>

260
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 1>show at this conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We agreed I would meet him in a room,</v>

261
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:16.240
<v Speaker 1>the judge in the corner and just ski.</v>

262
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.740
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you and I are here.</v>

263
00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>We sat down in the room and I looked him</v>
<v Speaker 1>right in the face and I said,</v>

264
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:24.670
<v Speaker 1>why did you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You never punched me.</v>

265
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.830
<v Speaker 1>He looked me back and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes I did.</v>

266
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.780
<v Speaker 1>I turned to the judge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

267
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.020
<v Speaker 1>there's no need to go any farther.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

268
00:14:32.021 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 1>if he's not going to admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen face to face one on one.</v>

269
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:39.790
<v Speaker 1>And I challenged his courage because</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

270
00:14:39.791 --> 00:14:43.690
<v Speaker 1>he had the courage to go to Iraq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the courage to shoot all these</v>

271
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:46.240
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have the courage to tell</v>

272
00:14:46.241 --> 00:14:47.230
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>

273
00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.350
<v Speaker 1>what a bizarre moment that must have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been sitting across from that guy.</v>

274
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

275
00:14:53.121 --> 00:14:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the look in his face?</v>

276
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not a doctor,</v>

277
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 1>but I've done some studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a sociopath.</v>

278
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Sociopath can lie and hold a straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>face and they lie to the point where</v>

279
00:15:06.651 --> 00:15:11.651
<v Speaker 1>they believe their own lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bizarre is it that this iconic</v>

280
00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:15.170
<v Speaker 1>figure and then look how he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

281
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had no training and post traumatic</v>

282
00:15:18.441 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not medical and yet he's taking</v>

283
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:26.771
<v Speaker 1>this marine to a gun range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who suffering from posttraumatic stress</v>

284
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.380
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't common sense tell you not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a weapon in the hands of someone</v>

285
00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.660
<v Speaker 1>suffering from posttraumatic stress.</v>

286
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Stress is different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what do they tell him to man up?</v>

287
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Why would you put a weapon in somebody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands who suffering from posttraumatic</v>

288
00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.940
<v Speaker 1>stress when you have no medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>training?</v>

289
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:51.880
<v Speaker 1>House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet,</v>

290
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:54.690
<v Speaker 1>qualified to treat this guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

291
00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I would assume it would be based on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own posttraumatic stress,</v>

292
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.840
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have it at all.</v>

293
00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was never treated for it.</v>

294
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.230
<v Speaker 1>He may have had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's why he did what he did.</v>

295
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

296
00:16:08.961 --> 00:16:10.470
<v Speaker 1>what a crazy place today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

297
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:11.900
<v Speaker 1>but the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

298
00:16:11.901 --> 00:16:14.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like I've been accused of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do.</v>

299
00:16:14.631 --> 00:16:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know the guy never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may have met him that night briefly.</v>

300
00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I obviously didn't get one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One millionth of a percent of the amount</v>

301
00:16:25.191 --> 00:16:26.240
<v Speaker 2>of hate that you did,</v>

302
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:31.820
<v Speaker 1>but just read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got read off for September 11th of</v>

303
00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:35.690
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in New York doing this book tour</v>

304
00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 1>and I got read off in a hotel lobby over</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

305
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.980
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Read off?</v>

306
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.580
<v Speaker 1>A guy yelled and screamed at me in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the entire hotel lobby,</v>

307
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I live with now and I</v>

308
00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 1>haven't been damaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My reputation isn't damaged over</v>

309
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:53.750
<v Speaker 1>something I never did.</v>

310
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:57.580
<v Speaker 2>When I was going to say is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I obviously haven't experienced one,</v>

311
00:16:57.581 --> 00:17:00.490
<v Speaker 2>1000000th of the hate that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I read.</v>

312
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:03.910
<v Speaker 2>We read this article on the air.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were trying to figure out what</v>

313
00:17:03.911 --> 00:17:08.170
<v Speaker 2>happened when your case was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we read this article that was,</v>

314
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in the New York Times.</v>

315
00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 2>See if he could find the article</v>
<v Speaker 2>detailing all the various lies.</v>

316
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an Yorker magazine.</v>

317
00:17:15.941 --> 00:17:19.640
<v Speaker 2>New Yorker Yorker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they did an investigation of him but it</v>

318
00:17:19.641 --> 00:17:24.310
<v Speaker 2>stunning and just reading that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking amount of hate tweets and</v>

319
00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:27.850
<v Speaker 2>facebook tweets and you fucking coward</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you this.</v>

320
00:17:27.851 --> 00:17:28.684
<v Speaker 2>He knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

321
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.070
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't write it.</v>

322
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just trying to figure out what the</v>

323
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.510
<v Speaker 2>fuck is going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if someone put something like that</v>

324
00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:37.240
<v Speaker 2>in the New Yorker with verified claims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

325
00:17:37.241 --> 00:17:39.610
<v Speaker 2>everything's verified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they were saying that he said and</v>

326
00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:41.920
<v Speaker 2>what actually had happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was all verified.</v>

327
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.970
<v Speaker 2>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

328
00:17:42.971 --> 00:17:47.170
<v Speaker 2>very confusing that somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 2>this slipped through the cracks and that</v>

329
00:17:47.171 --> 00:17:48.940
<v Speaker 2>this became their iconic figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

330
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:54.470
<v Speaker 2>not discounting along with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thousands and thousands of patriotic</v>

331
00:17:54.871 --> 00:17:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Americans that risked their lives.</v>

332
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And he is too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's denying.</v>

333
00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.640
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't a great sniper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's denying he didn't do his job.</v>

334
00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I've never denied that from him or said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that about him.</v>

335
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.190
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he may be the best.</v>

336
00:18:09.191 --> 00:18:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll still put my money on Carlos half</v>

337
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:16.600
<v Speaker 1>cocteau the marine as being the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>sniper I want especially now.</v>

338
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:17.800
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

339
00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:20.200
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did his job and he did it well.</v>

340
00:18:20.201 --> 00:18:22.810
<v Speaker 1>But why did he have to take an old</v>
<v Speaker 1>veteran?</v>

341
00:18:22.811 --> 00:18:26.920
<v Speaker 1>That would be like me taking a world war</v>
<v Speaker 1>two guy and throwing him under the bus.</v>

342
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Why the fuck would he choose you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I had fame.</v>

343
00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.590
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he got jealous that night.</v>

344
00:18:32.591 --> 00:18:35.920
<v Speaker 1>We were at the bar because everyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowded around and wanted their picture</v>

345
00:18:35.921 --> 00:18:38.470
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

346
00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll never be around to answer it.</v>

347
00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to know why he picked out me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think because I'm probably the most</v>

348
00:18:47.351 --> 00:18:52.351
<v Speaker 1>famous maybe or I develop to be the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous seal other than Dick Marcinko,</v>

349
00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:55.210
<v Speaker 1>the rogue warrior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great books.</v>

350
00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I read his books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a friend of mine.</v>

351
00:18:57.551 --> 00:18:58.540
<v Speaker 1>Richard Marcinko.</v>

352
00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:01.570
<v Speaker 2>When you sat down and you're talking to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

353
00:19:01.571 --> 00:19:03.610
<v Speaker 2>how much time were you actually in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room with them?</v>

354
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of minutes.</v>

355
00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Was all the minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minute he looked me in the eye and</v>

356
00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:09.070
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sure did he hit you.</v>

357
00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I turned to the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said we got nothing more to talk about.</v>

358
00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.210
<v Speaker 1>You didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I offered him.</v>

359
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I shed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you will walk out to be with the</v>

360
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.080
<v Speaker 1>fresh and admit you fabricated this</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

361
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 1>I will forgive you in front of the crash</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we will go on with our lives.</v>

362
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:33.370
<v Speaker 1>He would not do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did not have the courage to stand up</v>

363
00:19:33.371 --> 00:19:34.450
<v Speaker 1>and tell the truth.</v>

364
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.860
<v Speaker 2>It takes a lot of courage to admit you</v>
<v Speaker 2>lied about something that massive.</v>

365
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is in line about speeding,</v>

366
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:40.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

367
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:41.760
<v Speaker 2>This is a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive.</v>

368
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.860
<v Speaker 1>What about ruining my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruining my reputation,</v>

369
00:19:45.861 --> 00:19:50.861
<v Speaker 1>ruining my wife's life rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lost my conspiracy theory show because</v>

370
00:19:51.261 --> 00:19:54.680
<v Speaker 1>of it real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't get hired right now.</v>

371
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I can't get a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My last job was on the Internet.</v>

372
00:19:58.131 --> 00:20:02.390
<v Speaker 1>That aura tv because the owners Carlos</v>
<v Speaker 1>slim from Mexico.</v>

373
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.750
<v Speaker 1>From that you know who I'm hired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who I work for now?</v>

374
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.950
<v Speaker 1>The Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian TV are the only people that will</v>

375
00:20:09.951 --> 00:20:14.951
<v Speaker 1>hire me because 34 media conglomerate</v>
<v Speaker 1>centered this case to overturn me.</v>

376
00:20:16.221 --> 00:20:17.420
<v Speaker 1>You think they're going to hire me</v>

377
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.660
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Explain that.</v>

378
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think they did that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they did that?</v>

379
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:25.080
<v Speaker 2>Because if they overturn your case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can somehow or another,</v>

380
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:30.170
<v Speaker 2>because they don't want a credit check,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is that it or is that discrediting</v>

381
00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:33.030
<v Speaker 2>you in like that was a gigantic hit</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>

382
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.790
<v Speaker 2>But if they decide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they can discredit you,</v>

383
00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.130
<v Speaker 2>it makes that movie still value.</v>

384
00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stops me from running for president</v>

385
00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:43.180
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they can discredit me.</v>
