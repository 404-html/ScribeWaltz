00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>two live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Brown,</v>

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.270
<v Speaker 1>how are you sir?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

4
00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>It's great to be here.</v>

5
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 2>I have been enjoying your latest book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do have to tell you,</v>

6
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 2>I think you broke my brain with gage </v>
<v Speaker 2>symmetry.</v>

7
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I had to go over that about 30 or 40 </v>
<v Speaker 2>times to try to figure out what that </v>

8
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 2>means and how that works and.</v>

9
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing you did.</v>

10
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:23.480
<v Speaker 1>It breaks our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

11
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>I put it in there in spite of the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's hard.</v>

12
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>That part is hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is so central to the way we think</v>

13
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>about the world nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought I got to try and explain it</v>

14
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent,</v>

15
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>I broke my own brain trying to think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to explain it and I figured people </v>

16
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't devote as much time as you did </v>
<v Speaker 1>to doing it is so.</v>

17
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>It's so subtle that it's that many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd even.</v>

18
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Physicists have a hard time in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>grasping the implications of it,</v>

19
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>but it is so central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way we think about the universe.</v>

20
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought if I don't include it for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>inquiring mind like you then,</v>

21
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>then I feel bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so baffling.</v>

22
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.790
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

23
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the things that when I write</v>
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

24
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do most things for myself in a way </v>

25
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in every book I write,</v>

26
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.100
<v Speaker 1>I usually learn something [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>always when you're explaining stuff,</v>

27
00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>you'd suddenly.</v>

28
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>Most teachers say the first time they </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that anything is when they </v>

29
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.461
<v Speaker 1>teach it and gauge them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you I'd never thought of really how to </v>

30
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I tried to explain to my editor,</v>

31
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:23.151
<v Speaker 1>which was great because she didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>any science and she kept not </v>

32
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:23.151
<v Speaker 1>understanding yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

33
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>and then I came up with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation,</v>

34
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>involve these chess boards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still subtle,</v>

35
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>but I realized afterwards it was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>neat because when I developed this </v>

36
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>explanation for gates and mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I not only understood it in a new way,</v>

37
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>but I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gee,</v>

38
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I now understood physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I'd been.</v>

39
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.040
<v Speaker 1>If I'd had this explanation before I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have predicted this higgs </v>

40
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.221
<v Speaker 1>mechanism and all the things I only seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically all come out of the </v>

41
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>picture I gave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I loved that I was.</v>

42
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 1>It's a new way for me to think about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that I didn't</v>

43
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

44
00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:54.101
<v Speaker 2>most of what you guys do is almost like </v>
<v Speaker 2>another language to someone like myself </v>

45
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 2>and what would this seems to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This gauge symmetry seems to be a very </v>

46
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 2>complicated word in an alien language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

47
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>everything it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it nevertheless it.</v>

48
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It's so central and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can picture the fact that it's </v>

49
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.491
<v Speaker 1>fundamental to nature and they're free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we really want to understand nature </v>

50
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 1>at some level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to grapple with it.</v>

51
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

52
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>we're stuck with the world the way it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

53
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.130
<v Speaker 1>It'd be great if it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was a lot easier,</v>

54
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 1>but what?</v>

55
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that's one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating things about it is that it's</v>

56
00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 2>so bizarre.</v>

57
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

58
00:02:26.361 --> 00:02:31.361
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's the greatest story ever </v>

59
00:02:31.361 --> 00:02:33.131
<v Speaker 1>told so far because it's bizarre and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's bizarre and we've come </v>

60
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>this far is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just amazing.</v>

61
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:40.131
<v Speaker 1>We could have come this far and a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years and it's kind of sad that </v>

62
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>people don't realize because they cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck it.</v>

63
00:02:41.641 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>All this myth and superstition and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>real world is so much more interesting.</v>

64
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 2>It is unbelievably fascinating when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>delve into the world of quantum </v>

65
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.491
<v Speaker 2>mechanics and quantum physics and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these bizarre things that are happening </v>

66
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 2>far smaller than the eye can see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You really realize it is kind of magic.</v>

67
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like magic,</v>

68
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.870
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that that we get it at some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level is remarkable because with the </v>

69
00:03:06.271 --> 00:03:11.271
<v Speaker 1>other thing I find that makes it magic </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when you realize that the world we </v>

70
00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:14.661
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such an illusion that the real </v>

71
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:14.661
<v Speaker 1>world is so different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

72
00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:18.150
<v Speaker 1>and I love telling the story of how we </v>
<v Speaker 1>got there because you see scientists are</v>

73
00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:21.510
<v Speaker 1>biased and prejudiced and have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.950
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know where they're going,</v>

75
00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:27.951
<v Speaker 1>when it's even when it's wrong and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but science can overcome those biases </v>

76
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.060
<v Speaker 1>and prejudices and drag us kicking and </v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming in the right direction and,</v>

77
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's why the story is neat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also lately I've been thinking </v>

78
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.350
<v Speaker 1>in terms of politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whites also need because we need that to</v>

79
00:03:37.351 --> 00:03:39.900
<v Speaker 1>cut through the crap that we're hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in Washington that same,</v>

80
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.120
<v Speaker 1>the same scientific methods that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical inquiry of reliance on </v>

81
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.490
<v Speaker 1>empirical evidence of testing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of looking at many sources.</v>

82
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.280
<v Speaker 1>All those things are so essential for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the working right democracy,</v>

83
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.430
<v Speaker 1>but they're the same tools that have led</v>
<v Speaker 1>us to from just beginning to understand </v>

84
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.421
<v Speaker 1>how balls fall when you let them go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understanding the inner workings of </v>

85
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:03.411
<v Speaker 1>atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuclei and how the universe came to be </v>

86
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:06.201
<v Speaker 1>and why we're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just find it's the story so wonderful </v>

87
00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:11.030
<v Speaker 1>that it's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More people don't appreciate it and the </v>

88
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.080
<v Speaker 1>best part is the so far part to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>because everyday the story gets better.</v>

89
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:18.081
<v Speaker 1>I'm like that other greatest story which</v>
<v Speaker 1>was written by illiterate peasants 2000 </v>

90
00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 1>years ago and never changes because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was just as boring as it is now.</v>

91
00:04:21.121 --> 00:04:24.090
<v Speaker 1>And this one keeps changing and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised every day.</v>

92
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the things that's </v>

93
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.301
<v Speaker 2>important that you said is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists sometimes have ego problems </v>

94
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 2>and they have an idea where it's going </v>
<v Speaker 2>even if the evidence disproves them,</v>

95
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.620
<v Speaker 2>but that science corrects it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that using that explanation </v>

96
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.780
<v Speaker 2>or using that definition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sort of defines what's important </v>

97
00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.231
<v Speaker 2>about it because human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the most brilliant ones are flawed </v>

98
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 2>because we do have egos and we are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

99
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

100
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this story that I tell,</v>

101
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>which is for me actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

102
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:51.940
<v Speaker 1>for me it was interesting cause I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to learn.</v>

103
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I thought I knew the history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course when you write something </v>

104
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>down you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suddenly realize you don't.</v>

105
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.240
<v Speaker 1>And I and I had to learn it more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you want wanna,</v>

106
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 1>you want to take some of these people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shake them and say,</v>

107
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solutions right here,</v>

108
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>you got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you waiting 20 minutes,</v>

109
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking in the wrong direction.</v>

110
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.790
<v Speaker 1>The example I was just thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day and I was giving a talk.</v>

111
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you ever saw this video </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're supposed to look at these </v>

112
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>people bouncing basketballs and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're and you're supposed to,</v>

113
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:21.181
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to ruin it for you and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>your listeners if they haven't a show </v>

114
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:24.810
<v Speaker 1>where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're supposed to count the </v>

115
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.251
<v Speaker 1>basketballs and see many people are and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy walking between them and </v>

116
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>an ape suit and a gorilla suit and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>never see them,</v>

117
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.180
<v Speaker 1>You don't even see them because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>so focused on the wrong thing.</v>

119
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's the way physics often </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

120
00:05:33.401 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 1>We're focused on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think the direction is one direction.</v>

121
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 1>We're so focused on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even realize the solution is </v>

122
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.311
<v Speaker 1>there before our very eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's important because you </v>

123
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:44.311
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people think that science,</v>

124
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that scientists and science are the </v>

125
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>same thing and they're not scientists or</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

126
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.330
<v Speaker 1>The good thing about scientists that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the good scientist is they're at least </v>

127
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>willing to recognize in the end that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wrong.</v>

128
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.510
<v Speaker 1>So they have these preconceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the great thing about sciences that </v>

129
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.510
<v Speaker 1>trains us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

130
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.390
<v Speaker 1>there's these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are central to our being,</v>

131
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.780
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately we realized we're wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>and were willing to change our minds.</v>

132
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference between science </v>
<v Speaker 1>and religion really.</v>

133
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:09.150
<v Speaker 1>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 1>we have biases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>We have prejudice.</v>

136
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to believe we really want to </v>

137
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.771
<v Speaker 1>believe just like the x files,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but eventually when nature tells us </v>

138
00:06:17.771 --> 00:06:21.161
<v Speaker 1>otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we throw out those beliefs like </v>

139
00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>yesterday's newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why science is so neat now.</v>

140
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>People that are listening to this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going,</v>

141
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>what is gauged cemetery?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

142
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 1>you just passed over that and you said </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>

143
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:31.421
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way that you could possibly </v>

144
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:31.421
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

145
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>I'll give a try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how we do.</v>

146
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

147
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.640
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out that that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental principle in nature,</v>

148
00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:45.641
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really was discovered by this </v>

149
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:45.641
<v Speaker 1>wonderful woman mathematician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean your author who was,</v>

150
00:06:45.641 --> 00:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>who wasn't even allowed to get a job if </v>
<v Speaker 1>she would,</v>

151
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.940
<v Speaker 1>because she was a woman and the at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn of the century,</v>

152
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:53.450
<v Speaker 1>but she discovered so there's things we </v>
<v Speaker 1>say and we tell kids,</v>

153
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:58.451
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy is conserved and momentum is </v>

154
00:06:58.451 --> 00:06:58.451
<v Speaker 1>because driven.</v>

155
00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:02.380
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like the 10 commandments like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we come up with them because we liked </v>

156
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.380
<v Speaker 1>them and now we understand them </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

157
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.890
<v Speaker 1>We understand that everything that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative doesn't change in the </v>

158
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.491
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is due to a fundamental symmetry of </v>

159
00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:14.951
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So energy is conserved because we now </v>

160
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>understand the laws of physics don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>change over time.</v>

161
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 1>So as long as you it contest that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws of physics are two same tomorrow as</v>

162
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 1>they are today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than we know energy is concerned.</v>

163
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:29.741
<v Speaker 1>It's not something we take on faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mathematical consequence of that </v>

164
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:34.000
<v Speaker 1>momentum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservation is a consequence of the </v>

165
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.791
<v Speaker 1>fact that the laws of physics don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>change from place to place that they're </v>

166
00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:40.121
<v Speaker 1>saying in this studio here as they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be if we're having this conversation in </v>

167
00:07:40.121 --> 00:07:43.631
<v Speaker 1>New York that seems reasonable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she showed mathematically it's the </v>

168
00:07:43.631 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a.</v>

169
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.620
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's experienced this who knows,</v>

170
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.610
<v Speaker 1>learned any physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation of charge,</v>

171
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.990
<v Speaker 1>you know the electric charge and any </v>
<v Speaker 1>system doesn't change magically </v>

172
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:54.990
<v Speaker 1>overtime.</v>

173
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 1>That's a fundamental property of </v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity and magnetism.</v>

174
00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.460
<v Speaker 1>You got certain amount of charge at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

175
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be the same at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a consequence of the fact that </v>

176
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.810
<v Speaker 1>it's arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a symmetry of nature that says,</v>

177
00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>you know Benjamin Franklin called </v>
<v Speaker 1>electrons negative,</v>

178
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 1>negatively charged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't mean anything because I </v>

179
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 1>could have called them positively </v>
<v Speaker 1>charged.</v>

180
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just an arbitrary definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I changed every negative charge and </v>

181
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Speaker 1>the world to positive charge and every </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive charge and negative charge,</v>

182
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.560
<v Speaker 1>everything would work the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A symmetry of nature represents </v>

183
00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't change about nature.</v>

184
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.680
<v Speaker 1>When you make a change in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition,</v>

185
00:08:30.681 --> 00:08:35.010
<v Speaker 1>so making every calling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrons positively charged,</v>

186
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>protons negatively charged would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>make the world difference.</v>

187
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It's an arbitrary name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martians could call electrons,</v>

188
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:46.791
<v Speaker 1>positively charged and protons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The negatively charged is nothing </v>

189
00:08:46.791 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally important about the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive charge.</v>

190
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean any different than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative charge.</v>

191
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:53.720
<v Speaker 1>So I could change every right now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make all neck,</v>

192
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.550
<v Speaker 1>I could change the charge on every </v>
<v Speaker 1>electron,</v>

193
00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>the universe and flip it is signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every electron is negative.</v>

194
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Lead charged now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now suddenly I'm God and I make </v>

195
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.550
<v Speaker 1>every electron positively charged and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every make,</v>

196
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.461
<v Speaker 1>every proton negatively charged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing about the laws of physics will </v>

197
00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:10.461
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand that.</v>

198
00:09:10.461 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Why would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't it change?</v>

199
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:11.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

200
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Is there a function of them being </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and negatively charged?</v>

201
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a name.</v>

202
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:19.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so that I can call down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and down up and it wouldn't make any </v>

203
00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.050
<v Speaker 1>noise you make with your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

204
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the name I give it is irrelevant.</v>

205
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like you would change the </v>

206
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.120
<v Speaker 1>actual function of the electronic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

207
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

208
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I call it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's electrically charged.</v>

209
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

210
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.720
<v Speaker 1>And it repels other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other electrons because they have the </v>

211
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>same electric charge that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

212
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:41.910
<v Speaker 1>To electrically negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charged particles repel.</v>

213
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

214
00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:44.610
<v Speaker 1>if I made the both to positive charged </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>

215
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 1>they'd also repel so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the.</v>

216
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>So the physical consequences would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>change at all depending upon how I named</v>

217
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:51.420
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

218
00:09:51.421 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

219
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.710
<v Speaker 1>so the example I used in the book to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they sort of described that is a </v>

220
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.341
<v Speaker 1>chess board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Got White squares and black squares </v>

221
00:10:01.341 --> 00:10:04.011
<v Speaker 1>and you and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you played with the white chessman of </v>

222
00:10:04.011 --> 00:10:06.100
<v Speaker 1>the Webinar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I changed all the white squares into </v>

223
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>black squares and I rotated the board by</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 degrees it would look identical.</v>

224
00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.210
<v Speaker 1>And if I changed the black players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white players and white players,</v>

225
00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:16.440
<v Speaker 1>the black players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game of chess would be identical.</v>

226
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Nothing would change about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's white and what's black is kind</v>

227
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:20.760
<v Speaker 1>of arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

228
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:25.800
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is good because it kind of wasn't </v>

229
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.521
<v Speaker 1>than chess wouldn't be a fun game </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you always had black you </v>

230
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:28.521
<v Speaker 1>might win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you always had white,</v>

231
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:28.740
<v Speaker 1>you might win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

232
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it's the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

233
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:30.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

234
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 1>so I could change all white squares to </v>
<v Speaker 1>black squares and black squares,</v>

235
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:37.740
<v Speaker 1>two white squares and the game of chess </v>
<v Speaker 1>would not change.</v>

236
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's a symmetry of the chessboard </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's like,</v>

237
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:46.010
<v Speaker 1>that's like electric charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white being negative or positive and </v>

238
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:46.010
<v Speaker 1>black being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.150
<v Speaker 1>let's say I say white is negative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>black is positive.</v>

240
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.310
<v Speaker 1>If I switched all black to white or </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative positive,</v>

241
00:10:50.311 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>nothing would change about the game of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chess.</v>

242
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>If I switch negative to positive in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

243
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.200
<v Speaker 1>nothing changes in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The game of life,</v>

244
00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.470
<v Speaker 1>the game of physics would not change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rules wouldn't change.</v>

245
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.980
<v Speaker 1>The dynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything would remain the same about </v>

246
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.131
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that you could sort of see even that </v>

247
00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:10.131
<v Speaker 1>is not so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell from looking at your face,</v>

248
00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.140
<v Speaker 1>it's already not so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

249
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you couldn't sort of accept that.</v>

250
00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:16.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

251
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the easy part.</v>

252
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what gates symmetry says,</v>

253
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really weird.</v>

254
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:31.280
<v Speaker 1>I can actually do better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can arbitrarily change each white </v>

255
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.450
<v Speaker 1>squares on a chess board to a black </v>
<v Speaker 1>square.</v>

256
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I can choose randomly which white scares</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change the black squares and I can </v>

257
00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.761
<v Speaker 1>still make the game of chess the same if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just have a rule book and the robot </v>

258
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.760
<v Speaker 1>tells me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

259
00:11:44.761 --> 00:11:49.761
<v Speaker 1>if you're on that square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do what you could have done if </v>

260
00:11:49.761 --> 00:11:49.980
<v Speaker 1>it was a white square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I have the rule book,</v>

261
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.870
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't matter what color is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>squares are.</v>

262
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 1>If I know I was in the square that used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be white,</v>

263
00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but I call it black and I look at and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

264
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:58.270
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my my night can do this and that square,</v>

265
00:11:58.271 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 1>but it couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I have a rule book,</v>

266
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 1>then what?</v>

267
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Then I've arbitrarily free to change the</v>
<v Speaker 1>color of each square on a chess board.</v>

268
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 1>As long as a rule book tells me what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done,</v>

269
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.340
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

270
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.490
<v Speaker 1>that's electromagnetism because it turns</v>
<v Speaker 1>out electromagnetism as a symmetry that </v>

271
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.630
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

272
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>I could change the definition of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge on electron here,</v>

273
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:25.350
<v Speaker 1>but in the next room differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I could call this electron positive </v>

274
00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.990
<v Speaker 1>and one negative and it wouldn't change </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything as long as they had a rule book</v>

275
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.290
<v Speaker 1>that told me that I made that change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how and how the electromagnetic </v>

276
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.490
<v Speaker 1>interaction would be the same as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

277
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:40.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm free to change the definition of </v>

278
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.730
<v Speaker 1>what I call positive and negative charge</v>
<v Speaker 1>locally,</v>

279
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:45.420
<v Speaker 1>not globally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means I can do it differently here </v>

280
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:45.420
<v Speaker 1>and there as long as I have a rule book </v>
<v Speaker 1>that says,</v>

281
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that electron used to be negative.</v>

282
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.570
<v Speaker 1>So it'll still repel this electron here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though I call it positive and I </v>

283
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:52.810
<v Speaker 1>call that negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've changed locally the definition,</v>

284
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:55.270
<v Speaker 1>but I also changed the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

285
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the need for the rule book.</v>

286
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out that the rule book </v>
<v Speaker 1>really tells you it's a rule at each </v>

287
00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:02.680
<v Speaker 1>point in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

288
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a rule tells you what you can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't do at each point in space.</v>

289
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:11.520
<v Speaker 1>So we call that a function because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>function is a number or a rule at each </v>

290
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.330
<v Speaker 1>point in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A function at space is,</v>

291
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:13.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

292
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:15.230
<v Speaker 1>is exactly that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

293
00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:19.870
<v Speaker 1>it turns out the function that does that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the electromagnetic field.</v>

294
00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:25.410
<v Speaker 1>If you ask what would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical characteristics of a </v>

295
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:28.591
<v Speaker 1>quantity that would make sure the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>remain the same no matter what I called </v>

296
00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:33.450
<v Speaker 1>an electronic place to place and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked how I could write it down </v>

297
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:36.421
<v Speaker 1>mathematically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have exactly the mathematical </v>

298
00:13:36.421 --> 00:13:38.920
<v Speaker 1>form of the electromagnetic field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that that we call the electric</v>

299
00:13:38.921 --> 00:13:39.940
<v Speaker 1>field or magnetic field.</v>

300
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.480
<v Speaker 1>The mathematics of it is precisely fixed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by being able to allow us to change the </v>

301
00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:53.761
<v Speaker 1>definition of charge from place to place</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that doesn't change the </v>

302
00:13:53.761 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 1>ultimate dynamics doesn't change the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world works.</v>

303
00:13:55.180 --> 00:14:00.180
<v Speaker 1>It's prescribed by the mathematics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rule book is prescribed and the </v>

304
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.441
<v Speaker 1>mathematics of that rule book turns out </v>
<v Speaker 1>magically almost to be exactly the </v>

305
00:14:04.441 --> 00:14:08.431
<v Speaker 1>mathematics of Maxwell's equations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the equations of </v>

306
00:14:08.431 --> 00:14:08.880
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's where it gets squirrely from it.</v>

307
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you change the definitions?</v>

308
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Why would you need that rule book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

309
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.730
<v Speaker 1>because I mean what it says is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature somehow as the symmetry,</v>

310
00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.060
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't depend what will you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>

311
00:14:22.061 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 1>but it says nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature has designed itself such that the</v>

312
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:29.890
<v Speaker 1>definition of electric charge from place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to place is arbitrary.</v>

313
00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.100
<v Speaker 1>It really came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to step back,</v>

314
00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Einstein told us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that length and time are kind </v>

315
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.931
<v Speaker 1>of relative to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They depend upon the observer and his </v>

316
00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:43.810
<v Speaker 1>theory of general relativity actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

317
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.460
<v Speaker 1>I can define locally what my coordinate </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is,</v>

318
00:14:48.461 --> 00:14:50.080
<v Speaker 1>what my length is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what my time is.</v>

319
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I can define that arbitrarily locally</v>

320
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.940
<v Speaker 3>and it may differ from place to place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My rulers could differ from place to </v>

321
00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.631
<v Speaker 3>place but the war,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the universe doesn't care because </v>

322
00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:05.201
<v Speaker 3>there's this thing called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gravitational field that takes into </v>

323
00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:05.201
<v Speaker 3>account of that and nature has that </v>
<v Speaker 3>cemetery.</v>

324
00:15:05.201 --> 00:15:07.460
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't matter if I change the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rule book,</v>

325
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.430
<v Speaker 3>if I change the what I define as space </v>
<v Speaker 3>and time locally,</v>

326
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 3>the universe behaves exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you say by symmetry,</v>

327
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:19.121
<v Speaker 3>do you mean essentially there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance that there's always going to be </v>

328
00:15:19.121 --> 00:15:19.340
<v Speaker 3>an equal numbers of negatives and </v>
<v Speaker 3>positives and that's changed.</v>

329
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.200
<v Speaker 3>That's the functions of each one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

330
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.230
<v Speaker 3>it balances itself out as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's sort of a consequence.</v>

331
00:15:24.231 --> 00:15:24.650
<v Speaker 3>It says</v>

332
00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.970
<v Speaker 1>universe can't be charged and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately.</v>

333
00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.790
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really says that that's.</v>

334
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:36.080
<v Speaker 1>That's a quality of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nature doesn't care about law.</v>

335
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Namely you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

336
00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:42.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a label,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nature has a symmetry in physics.</v>

337
00:15:42.651 --> 00:15:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Symmetries are things when you make </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>

338
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:47.170
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the object doesn't change.</v>

339
00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Take a sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

340
00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:50.250
<v Speaker 1>that's fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can rotate it,</v>

341
00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.550
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like a sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what rotation you make,</v>

342
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a symmetry of the sphere.</v>

343
00:15:55.531 --> 00:15:59.520
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so beautiful in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically is the same way.</v>

344
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 1>I can take another quantity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll call it electric charge at this </v>

345
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:05.580
<v Speaker 1>point and I can change it if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

346
00:16:05.581 --> 00:16:10.581
<v Speaker 1>make a rotation and some internal space </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can imagine an internal space of </v>

347
00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:12.120
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative charges were part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of some continuum.</v>

348
00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I make a rotation and nature doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>care about it.</v>

349
00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:18.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a symmetry of the equations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>govern nature,</v>

350
00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.820
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out the reason this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

351
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Let me step back again because your face</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells it all.</v>

352
00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:25.380
<v Speaker 1>I wish people could see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can.</v>

353
00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

354
00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

355
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:31.250
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what we've discovered is that the </v>

356
00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:38.961
<v Speaker 1>playing field determines the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The characteristics of the playing </v>

357
00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:39.270
<v Speaker 1>field's determine the roles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If baseball,</v>

358
00:16:39.271 --> 00:16:43.530
<v Speaker 1>if you played baseball and there were </v>
<v Speaker 1>five bases instead of for the rules will</v>

359
00:16:43.531 --> 00:16:48.531
<v Speaker 1>be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the distance between home plate and </v>

360
00:16:48.531 --> 00:16:49.200
<v Speaker 1>first base was a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules would be different.</v>

361
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.040
<v Speaker 1>If you had 25 out of feelers out in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Outfield,</v>

362
00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.750
<v Speaker 1>it would be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

363
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.720
<v Speaker 1>So the playing field determines the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>

364
00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:58.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

365
00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Baseball will be very different game if </v>
<v Speaker 1>we played on a field that's different.</v>

366
00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:08.180
<v Speaker 1>What we've discovered in nature as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to think the forces were kind of </v>

367
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:08.180
<v Speaker 1>fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Newton told us that goes man and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

369
00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:13.440
<v Speaker 1>What we discovered is the thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really constrains what can happen in the</v>

370
00:17:13.441 --> 00:17:17.640
<v Speaker 1>world is the playing field and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics of the playing field.</v>

371
00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:23.090
<v Speaker 1>And for physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what determines the characteristics of </v>

372
00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:23.340
<v Speaker 1>the playing field are the symmetries of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that playing field.</v>

373
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.170
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball,</v>

374
00:17:25.171 --> 00:17:27.990
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it looks like a diamond is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a is a symmetry,</v>

375
00:17:27.991 --> 00:17:28.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

376
00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:31.410
<v Speaker 1>The thing feel looks the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could call first base,</v>

377
00:17:31.411 --> 00:17:34.800
<v Speaker 1>home plate and home played first base if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rotated the whole field,</v>

378
00:17:34.801 --> 00:17:38.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It determines in some sense that's the.</v>

379
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:43.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a characteristic of baseball that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of determines the rules of the </v>

380
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.980
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

381
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And what we've learned is what's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental in nature is the of that </v>

382
00:17:49.741 --> 00:17:54.741
<v Speaker 1>playing field and what determines the </v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics that playing fields are </v>

383
00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:58.281
<v Speaker 1>the symmetries of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that that demonstrate to us </v>

384
00:17:58.281 --> 00:18:02.750
<v Speaker 1>that what we think is fundamental is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really just an arbitrary label like </v>

385
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:06.741
<v Speaker 1>electric charge isn't we've discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an arbitrary label locally as well as</v>

386
00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:12.231
<v Speaker 1>globally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that determines the whole nature of </v>

387
00:18:12.231 --> 00:18:12.231
<v Speaker 1>the forces that can happen.</v>

388
00:18:12.231 --> 00:18:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Once you say the electric charge is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary thing in nature,</v>

389
00:18:14.941 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 1>doesn't care what you call positive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negative from here or Mars.</v>

390
00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:24.050
<v Speaker 1>That determines the nature of the force </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we call the electromagnetic </v>

391
00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:28.011
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely prescribed and it turns </v>

392
00:18:28.011 --> 00:18:28.011
<v Speaker 1>out that's true for all the forces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

393
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:33.170
<v Speaker 1>The nature of gravity is determined as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein showed by the fact that you can</v>

394
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:38.271
<v Speaker 1>change what I define as one meter here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and on Mars called one meter or </v>

395
00:18:38.611 --> 00:18:42.090
<v Speaker 1>something else and nature doesn't care </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I label as a meter.</v>

396
00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:47.900
<v Speaker 1>It turns out gravity takes that into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account and says what we define as </v>

397
00:18:48.631 --> 00:18:53.631
<v Speaker 1>length is irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental gravitational field is </v>

398
00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:56.751
<v Speaker 1>due to a curvature of space that that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of what we define as length </v>

399
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.480
<v Speaker 1>or time locally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing,</v>

400
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:05.481
<v Speaker 1>but it's a property of space and time </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Einstein discovered for general </v>

401
00:19:05.481 --> 00:19:05.481
<v Speaker 1>relativity.</v>

402
00:19:05.481 --> 00:19:06.030
<v Speaker 1>We've discovered it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetism.</v>

403
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:11.060
<v Speaker 1>It turns out all the forces of nature </v>
<v Speaker 1>respect that same kind of same kind of </v>

404
00:19:11.491 --> 00:19:16.491
<v Speaker 1>mathematical symmetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's some quantity that you can </v>

405
00:19:16.491 --> 00:19:20.151
<v Speaker 1>change in your equations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can change its definition and the </v>

406
00:19:20.151 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 1>equations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the physics remains the same and the</v>

407
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.220
<v Speaker 1>nature of the equations this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>prescribed.</v>

408
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.900
<v Speaker 1>The mathematical form of the prescribe </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations is prescribed precisely by the</v>

409
00:19:30.901 --> 00:19:34.680
<v Speaker 1>requirement that I can change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of electric charge.</v>

410
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:39.681
<v Speaker 1>That electric charge is arbitrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can call an electron positive or </v>

411
00:19:39.681 --> 00:19:41.400
<v Speaker 1>negative anywhere I want in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the equations don't care.</v>

412
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.980
<v Speaker 1>That prescribes the fourth formula </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations.</v>

413
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:45.690
<v Speaker 1>They have to have a very particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>

414
00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:51.020
<v Speaker 1>a unique form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that unique for them happens to be </v>

415
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:53.400
<v Speaker 1>the form that it has now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can say,</v>

416
00:19:53.401 --> 00:19:58.401
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an accident that really there's </v>

417
00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:00.501
<v Speaker 1>something fundamental that the equations</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this form in low and we've </v>

418
00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:03.741
<v Speaker 1>discovered this mathematical symmetry is</v>
<v Speaker 1>an accident or you can say that the </v>

419
00:20:03.741 --> 00:20:08.151
<v Speaker 1>mathematical symmetry is fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a property of nature and it </v>

420
00:20:08.151 --> 00:20:11.890
<v Speaker 1>prescribes the form of the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces that nature that the world.</v>

421
00:20:11.891 --> 00:20:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Laos.</v>

422
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.820
<v Speaker 2>When you say that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

423
00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.790
<v Speaker 2>that it's fundamental that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissymmetry is fundamental.</v>

424
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.330
<v Speaker 2>Do you see this image?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you study like ecosystems?</v>

425
00:20:20.331 --> 00:20:23.180
<v Speaker 2>Do you study?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know about them but I'm an but do</v>

426
00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:28.181
<v Speaker 2>you ever contemplate them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you thinking about theoretical </v>

427
00:20:28.181 --> 00:20:30.461
<v Speaker 2>physics and when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you ever look at like how these </v>

428
00:20:30.461 --> 00:20:32.000
<v Speaker 2>animals sort of stay in balance in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>ecosystems when they're untouched?</v>

429
00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:33.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the mathematics of.</v>

430
00:20:33.501 --> 00:20:35.270
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the great thing about </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics.</v>

431
00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:38.270
<v Speaker 2>About Science in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like Hollywood,</v>

432
00:20:38.271 --> 00:20:39.350
<v Speaker 2>if it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you copy it</v>

433
00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.680
<v Speaker 1>and and so we often find the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical formalism plight,</v>

434
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.740
<v Speaker 1>a vastly different systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a famous set of equations of </v>

435
00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Predator and prey for ecosystems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

436
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.980
<v Speaker 1>and you can look at those equations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the same kind of equations that </v>

437
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.640
<v Speaker 1>apply in many different systems and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

438
00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:02.930
<v Speaker 1>in oatmeal boiling and also it's amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the same mathematics appears and </v>

439
00:21:03.281 --> 00:21:08.281
<v Speaker 1>very different systems and we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore use what we've learned in one </v>

440
00:21:08.281 --> 00:21:11.611
<v Speaker 1>case to apply to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we copy it because it works </v>

441
00:21:11.611 --> 00:21:14.671
<v Speaker 1>so broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing that very few equations </v>

442
00:21:14.671 --> 00:21:18.260
<v Speaker 1>turn out to so broadly described so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>vastly different systems and Predator </v>

443
00:21:18.281 --> 00:21:23.281
<v Speaker 1>prey relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is I think what you're talking </v>

444
00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:25.351
<v Speaker 1>about in ecosystems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you know there's a in an evening </v>

445
00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:25.351
<v Speaker 1>with plants as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

446
00:21:25.351 --> 00:21:26.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like the full system.</v>

447
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you.</v>

448
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:29.560
<v Speaker 1>And it becomes more complicated when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>include more variables,</v>

449
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.370
<v Speaker 1>but physics of course is generally much </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier than many ecosystems.</v>

450
00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:34.960
<v Speaker 1>That's why I do physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so much easier.</v>

451
00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.250
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's really the low hanging</v>
<v Speaker 1>fruit nature and it's fun for you.</v>

452
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

453
00:21:40.121 --> 00:21:40.680
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

454
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.720
<v Speaker 1>but for most people listening to this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 100 people that have driven </v>

455
00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.991
<v Speaker 1>into trees by now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is this guy talking </v>

456
00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:52.171
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad there's people like you out </v>

457
00:21:52.171 --> 00:21:55.201
<v Speaker 1>there that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can feel good that the laws of </v>

458
00:21:55.201 --> 00:21:55.420
<v Speaker 1>physics are independent of whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've run into the tree.</v>

459
00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:58.210
<v Speaker 1>So feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that gives them great comfort.</v>

460
00:21:58.211 --> 00:21:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

461
00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just the study of this is so it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so taxing.</v>

462
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.590
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

463
00:22:05.591 --> 00:22:06.820
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

464
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.920
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

465
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:13.020
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of bothers me is that people </v>

466
00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:15.040
<v Speaker 1>when they think it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be taxing.</v>

467
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.040
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the interesting thing is that </v>

468
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:20.470
<v Speaker 1>doesn't apply in other areas of actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people can be.</v>

469
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:25.710
<v Speaker 1>They don't think they have to be or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clapton to enjoy guitar music or pub or </v>

470
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Picasso to enjoy where paintings or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Shakespeare to enjoy place,</v>

471
00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:32.890
<v Speaker 1>but somehow and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's taxing in its own way.</v>

472
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more you want.</v>

473
00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take Bach.</v>

474
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:38.560
<v Speaker 1>The more you understand music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the more you appreciate box,</v>

475
00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Bach Cantatas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different voices,</v>

476
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.700
<v Speaker 1>but I can enjoy just listening to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

477
00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.240
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

478
00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.950
<v Speaker 1>but people say in every other activity </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fine,</v>

479
00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:48.760
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to science they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

480
00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:53.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even touch it at all and what I </v>

481
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 1>try and do in my books and a place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

482
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's things you don't have to master </v>

483
00:22:59.880 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

484
00:22:59.880 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you may not know.</v>

485
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Master gave some of the most subtle and </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated thing in all of modern </v>

486
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.450
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can still,</v>

487
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.220
<v Speaker 1>even if you skip that section of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

488
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.700
<v Speaker 1>there are still things in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can appreciate it.</v>

489
00:23:08.701 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 1>But how we understand the world that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't appreciate before and have that</v>

490
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:17.641
<v Speaker 1>orgasmic Aha experience that hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is different than I thought </v>

491
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's wonderful.</v>

492
00:23:20.201 --> 00:23:22.480
<v Speaker 1>So you can appreciate science without </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastering.</v>

493
00:23:22.481 --> 00:23:27.481
<v Speaker 1>It's sure it gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetry and things like that are </v>

494
00:23:27.481 --> 00:23:31.860
<v Speaker 1>basically mathematical concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to talk about them in language </v>

495
00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:34.870
<v Speaker 1>without math is always sort of verbose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

496
00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I think what's important about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

497
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm in chapter 10 or 11,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

498
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.120
<v Speaker 1>I think what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really important about it is not,</v>

499
00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 1>you're not speaking in layman's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're also</v>

500
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 2>not speaking in theoretical physicist </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms.</v>

501
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.690
<v Speaker 2>You're making a bridge.</v>

502
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

503
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.600
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone,</v>

504
00:23:52.601 --> 00:23:57.601
<v Speaker 1>I think Richard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few people said nicely said about the </v>

505
00:23:57.601 --> 00:23:58.530
<v Speaker 1>book that as they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they claimed as long would said,</v>

506
00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make it simple but not </v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler than it can be.</v>

507
00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the right way saying,</v>

508
00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:04.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's important to do that,</v>

509
00:24:04.751 --> 00:24:06.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean as it respects the reader,</v>

510
00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.050
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

511
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.620
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

512
00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:10.720
<v Speaker 1>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

513
00:24:10.721 --> 00:24:12.010
<v Speaker 1>you want to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

514
00:24:12.011 --> 00:24:12.730
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

515
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:17.760
<v Speaker 1>here's what you need to know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it and here's how I can try </v>

516
00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.931
<v Speaker 1>and explain it without math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can puzzle through it and think </v>

517
00:24:21.931 --> 00:24:22.870
<v Speaker 1>about it and eventually maybe get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Aha stage.</v>

518
00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.880
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I could just say,</v>

519
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poof,</v>

520
00:24:26.291 --> 00:24:27.460
<v Speaker 1>it all happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.050
<v Speaker 1>and then that's religion in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But except the differences.</v>

522
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:32.400
<v Speaker 1>This as content religion doesn't</v>

523
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:34.420
<v Speaker 2>for people like me that have never </v>
<v Speaker 2>studied it.</v>

524
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:39.660
<v Speaker 2>When I read what you're doing in a read </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's been done and I read all of the </v>

525
00:24:39.911 --> 00:24:44.911
<v Speaker 2>people out there that are trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decipher all this magical stuff out </v>

526
00:24:44.911 --> 00:24:44.950
<v Speaker 2>there in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

527
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:50.060
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's important to just to be aware that </v>

528
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.570
<v Speaker 2>this is going on because I think for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>vast majority of the 7 billion people on</v>

529
00:24:52.571 --> 00:24:55.540
<v Speaker 2>the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is just unknown exactly,</v>

530
00:24:55.541 --> 00:24:57.760
<v Speaker 2>but it said it's being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's being discovered,</v>

531
00:24:57.761 --> 00:25:00.280
<v Speaker 2>it's being contemplated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's being studied</v>

532
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.470
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just that it's being done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's amazing.</v>

533
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:08.670
<v Speaker 1>It has changed our picture of our place </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the universe and therefore I think </v>

534
00:25:08.991 --> 00:25:11.030
<v Speaker 1>science is like art and music and </v>
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>

535
00:25:11.031 --> 00:25:16.031
<v Speaker 1>It's they all serve the same purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science also produces technology and </v>

536
00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:17.780
<v Speaker 1>somehow people think that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science is good for sure.</v>

537
00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:19.280
<v Speaker 1>It produces the technology that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

538
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:24.310
<v Speaker 1>allowing you and I'd have this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation and people to listen as </v>

539
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.310
<v Speaker 1>long as you and I live longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the rest,</v>

540
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:27.230
<v Speaker 1>but the really neat thing about science </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it is just like those other things.</v>

541
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.680
<v Speaker 1>It changes our perspective of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

542
00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:35.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's what's so wonderful that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>once said that science is sort of one of</v>

543
00:25:35.901 --> 00:25:37.850
<v Speaker 1>the purposes is to make people </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

544
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.740
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I felt regretted that for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a while,</v>

545
00:25:39.741 --> 00:25:44.741
<v Speaker 1>but it really isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're never outside your comfort </v>

546
00:25:44.741 --> 00:25:44.741
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're never,</v>

547
00:25:44.741 --> 00:25:45.920
<v Speaker 1>you're never growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I completely agree.</v>

548
00:25:45.921 --> 00:25:47.030
<v Speaker 1>And I love that quote in the book.</v>

549
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that for,</v>

550
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.940
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people that discomfort is </v>
<v Speaker 2>just people are tired,</v>

551
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they work the jobs,</v>

552
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:59.741
<v Speaker 2>they've got families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got a lot of stuff to do and </v>

553
00:25:59.741 --> 00:26:01.960
<v Speaker 2>something like this comes along that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like throws a monkey wrench into </v>

554
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:01.960
<v Speaker 2>the gears of the mind.</v>

555
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>

556
00:26:02.191 --> 00:26:04.760
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you want your mind blown </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you know,</v>

557
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.870
<v Speaker 1>you can skim over or I try with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>books and say,</v>

558
00:26:06.871 --> 00:26:08.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that part you can get,</v>

559
00:26:08.641 --> 00:26:09.470
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

560
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not like suddenly you won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the rest of the book.</v>

561
00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And the stuff is so neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's this invisible </v>

562
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.550
<v Speaker 1>field everywhere in the universe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes the way you haven't got there,</v>

563
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.220
<v Speaker 1>the book yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

564
00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:25.430
<v Speaker 1>but that changes our picture of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is amazing and people should </v>

565
00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:31.370
<v Speaker 1>have the opportunity to know that our </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture is shown that we are a cosmic </v>

566
00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.750
<v Speaker 1>accident that were just like an icicle </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a window,</v>

567
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:39.030
<v Speaker 1>that whose direction if you lived on </v>
<v Speaker 1>that icicle might seem very special to </v>

568
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:43.701
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as an accident and it turns out the </v>

569
00:26:43.701 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 1>forces nature are what they are by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same kind of accident because some field</v>

570
00:26:47.041 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>froze in the early universe in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

571
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:54.670
<v Speaker 1>If it had frozen in another direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I wouldn't be having this </v>

572
00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.261
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we would we be a different </v>

573
00:26:57.261 --> 00:26:57.261
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

574
00:26:57.261 --> 00:27:01.700
<v Speaker 1>in most cases you wouldn't even have you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and me because there wouldn't be </v>

575
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:05.151
<v Speaker 1>particles that have mass and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have stars and galaxies and </v>

576
00:27:05.151 --> 00:27:05.151
<v Speaker 1>planets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what?</v>

577
00:27:05.151 --> 00:27:05.160
<v Speaker 1>There would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say,</v>

578
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but I can definitely say that everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see in the universe would be gone.</v>

579
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:14.240
<v Speaker 1>But you're confident that it was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident at some point in time and what </v>

580
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I've created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean by accident.</v>

581
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.330
<v Speaker 1>No more of an accident or less of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>accident than an icicle.</v>

582
00:27:18.331 --> 00:27:23.331
<v Speaker 1>On a window now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at icicles on a window with </v>

583
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:23.331
<v Speaker 1>they're beautiful patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in all different directions now.</v>

584
00:27:23.331 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a physical reason ultimately why</v>
<v Speaker 1>one icicle forms in a,</v>

585
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:29.910
<v Speaker 1>in a given direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no significance to that.</v>

586
00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:35.240
<v Speaker 1>It may have been a dust particle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused that part that we're not saying </v>

587
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.690
<v Speaker 1>it's magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was ultimately some micro physical</v>

588
00:27:36.691 --> 00:27:41.691
<v Speaker 1>reason why that happened and why oatmeal</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll boils a bubble up occurs in one </v>

589
00:27:41.691 --> 00:27:42.150
<v Speaker 1>place and not another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

590
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:47.480
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing significant about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bubble popping up here or that </v>

591
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:48.840
<v Speaker 1>icicle pointing in a given direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fate and not fate.</v>

592
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not designed right it anything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible in that icicle.</v>

593
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what,</v>

594
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:58.960
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is our universe is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way it is because of field frozen a </v>

595
00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.160
<v Speaker 1>certain direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's true.</v>

596
00:27:59.161 --> 00:28:04.161
<v Speaker 1>There are laws of physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the field Kent can freeze in that </v>

597
00:28:04.161 --> 00:28:04.350
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also laws of physics.</v>

598
00:28:04.351 --> 00:28:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Say the field could have frozen maybe in</v>
<v Speaker 1>another direction,</v>

599
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.300
<v Speaker 1>and if it did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything would be different.</v>

600
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Now what my field would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you defining where the field is?</v>

601
00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:14.250
<v Speaker 1>A Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had you gotta take him.</v>

602
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

603
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:16.260
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

604
00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I was worried about the field is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

605
00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:20.790
<v Speaker 1>it's like the electric field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

606
00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Some quantity that's defined in each </v>
<v Speaker 1>point in space.</v>

607
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.440
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the neat thing in particle physics </v>

608
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:29.440
<v Speaker 1>is every field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an electric field,</v>

609
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 1>every field is associated with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary particle.</v>

610
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.930
<v Speaker 1>So the electric field is produced by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coherent state of photons,</v>

611
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.470
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate Quanta of electromagnetism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

612
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual particles that are,</v>

613
00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 1>that are being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going into your eye right now </v>

614
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:46.380
<v Speaker 1>and are being absorbed by your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see me.</v>

615
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.800
<v Speaker 1>The reason you can see light is it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of little particles entering your </v>

616
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.341
<v Speaker 1>eye that had been that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are reflecting off my eyes so you </v>

617
00:28:55.341 --> 00:28:55.341
<v Speaker 1>can see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

618
00:28:55.341 --> 00:28:58.680
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out in quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every field,</v>

619
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:02.340
<v Speaker 1>which is a point which is a function of </v>
<v Speaker 1>points in space.</v>

620
00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.870
<v Speaker 1>The electric field in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

621
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:06.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a magnetic field in this room </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're in the here in the.</v>

622
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:08.190
<v Speaker 1>In the earth has a magnetic field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

623
00:29:08.191 --> 00:29:13.191
<v Speaker 1>If they put a compass here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will feel the magnetic field that's </v>

624
00:29:13.191 --> 00:29:16.640
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this coherent state of photons </v>

625
00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.180
<v Speaker 1>that are basically very regular in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

626
00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.370
<v Speaker 1>That's really what a field is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quantum physics,</v>

627
00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.640
<v Speaker 1>a very regular configuration of </v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary particles that are sort of </v>

628
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.290
<v Speaker 1>hidden in space and it turns out there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>this background fields we call the higgs</v>

629
00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:31.740
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is everywhere in space and happens</v>

630
00:29:31.741 --> 00:29:36.741
<v Speaker 1>to have a very particular configuration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when the particles that make </v>

631
00:29:36.741 --> 00:29:38.190
<v Speaker 1>your body and my body up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we moved through it,</v>

632
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.460
<v Speaker 1>they experienced a resistance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes them to behave as if they have </v>

633
00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 1>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the field wasn't there,</v>

634
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:47.260
<v Speaker 1>the particles will be massless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like swimming in molasses.</v>

635
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.220
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

636
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:50.980
<v Speaker 1>if you're swimming in water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel pretty light,</v>

637
00:29:50.981 --> 00:29:54.490
<v Speaker 1>but if I've filled the pool up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>molasses and you tried to do 100 meters,</v>

638
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.230
<v Speaker 1>you'd be pretty damn tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of it,</v>

639
00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:58.240
<v Speaker 1>you'd feel like you're weigh thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of pounds.</v>

640
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.570
<v Speaker 1>We're swimming through molasses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't see it.</v>

641
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.370
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

642
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like,</v>

643
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.090
<v Speaker 1>as I was just saying to a group earlier </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

644
00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.120
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

645
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:15.121
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an invisible field </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere that's responsible for our </v>

646
00:30:15.121 --> 00:30:15.121
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like religion,</v>

647
00:30:15.121 --> 00:30:17.980
<v Speaker 1>except for the fact in physics we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that's not good enough.</v>

648
00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.010
<v Speaker 1>If it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got to find it and if it's there,</v>

649
00:30:21.011 --> 00:30:26.011
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that field is associated with </v>

650
00:30:26.011 --> 00:30:26.011
<v Speaker 1>particles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>

651
00:30:26.011 --> 00:30:27.310
<v Speaker 1>as I as I like to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cosmic sadomasochism.</v>

652
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.670
<v Speaker 1>If I spank the vacuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I dumped enough energy and empty </v>

653
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.910
<v Speaker 1>space at a single point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should kick out real particles.</v>

654
00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.150
<v Speaker 1>If that field is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the higgs field is there,</v>

655
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.600
<v Speaker 1>if I dump enough energy and empty space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll kick out real particles.</v>

656
00:30:40.601 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll call them Hicks particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>

657
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Let me build a big machine in Geneva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest and most complicated machine</v>

658
00:30:46.901 --> 00:30:51.901
<v Speaker 1>humans have ever built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it the large Hadron collider that </v>

659
00:30:51.901 --> 00:30:54.991
<v Speaker 1>dumps enough energy into a point in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space that can maybe kick out higgs </v>

660
00:30:54.991 --> 00:30:55.630
<v Speaker 1>particles of the really there and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what?</v>

661
00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.360
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On July Fourth,</v>

662
00:30:58.361 --> 00:31:03.361
<v Speaker 1>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we announced the discovery of 50 </v>

663
00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.170
<v Speaker 1>particles that looked and sounded and </v>
<v Speaker 1>walked and quack like Higgs is,</v>

664
00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.500
<v Speaker 1>and we now have tested them much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced many more and they're they're </v>

665
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.470
<v Speaker 1>higgs particle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gives us evidence that that field </v>

666
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:14.740
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was an outrageous and audacious claim</v>

667
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:20.070
<v Speaker 1>that the properties of the universe we </v>
<v Speaker 1>see are an accident due to this </v>

668
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:24.451
<v Speaker 1>background field that's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that background field wasn't </v>

669
00:31:24.451 --> 00:31:24.451
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world would look very different.</v>

670
00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it a consequence of this field or</v>

671
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 1>an accident?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

672
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 1>the properties of the universe we </v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced are consequences that field,</v>

673
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:38.730
<v Speaker 1>but that field being there is as much an</v>
<v Speaker 1>accident as an icicle freezing on a </v>

674
00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.841
<v Speaker 1>window in a certain direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The field could have frozen with a </v>

675
00:31:42.841 --> 00:31:45.721
<v Speaker 1>different value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have frozen with a different </v>

676
00:31:45.721 --> 00:31:47.360
<v Speaker 1>magnitude or if that's where I'm gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well not just that.</v>

677
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:52.590
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for me to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you can determine in one way or </v>

678
00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:52.810
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field here.</v>

679
00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:57.811
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example that I try </v>

680
00:31:57.811 --> 00:31:57.811
<v Speaker 1>and use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

681
00:31:57.811 --> 00:31:57.820
<v Speaker 1>it just got a version of it just got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I went online,</v>

682
00:31:57.821 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I used a beer bottle as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have drunk beer once or twice in</v>

683
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:01.870
<v Speaker 1>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>

684
00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:02.530
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

685
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you've ever had a party.</v>

686
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you forgot to put the beer in the </v>

687
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:09.330
<v Speaker 1>fridge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So have done.</v>

688
00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Put it in the freezer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

689
00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:11.160
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happens?</v>

690
00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:13.680
<v Speaker 1>You forget that it's in the freezer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>

691
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:16.210
<v Speaker 1>And then the next morning you discovered</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the freezer explodes.</v>

692
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>

693
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because really the,</v>

694
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:22.540
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beer would rather be frozen,</v>

695
00:32:22.541 --> 00:32:25.690
<v Speaker 1>but when it's under pressure in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle it's liquid.</v>

696
00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for example,</v>

697
00:32:27.581 --> 00:32:32.581
<v Speaker 1>if you open the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the pressure is released and it's </v>

698
00:32:32.581 --> 00:32:32.581
<v Speaker 1>suddenly freezes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

699
00:32:32.581 --> 00:32:34.030
<v Speaker 1>The beer has changed from one state to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

700
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.000
<v Speaker 1>It's gone from liquid to solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it's gone to solid,</v>

701
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.590
<v Speaker 1>it's suddenly releases a lot of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

702
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.460
<v Speaker 1>If you wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could think of the,</v>

703
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:48.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the properties of that beer as a </v>

704
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.470
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can either be liquid or solid.</v>

705
00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it changes depending upon the </v>

706
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:53.650
<v Speaker 1>temperature and the pressure and all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest,</v>

707
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.020
<v Speaker 1>it turns out the state of the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes as the universe cools.</v>

708
00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.510
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Higgs is like the,</v>

709
00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:03.260
<v Speaker 1>as like a sort of a cosmic fluid that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

710
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:08.440
<v Speaker 1>And as a universe cooled down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly it found would rather be in a </v>

711
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 1>certain configuration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would rather be frozen in liquid.</v>

712
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at some numbers that tell you </v>

713
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:14.800
<v Speaker 1>whether it's acting like it's frozen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid,</v>

714
00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:19.150
<v Speaker 1>just like I could describe the beer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I could define some numbers that would </v>

715
00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:19.970
<v Speaker 1>tell me whether the beer was frozen or </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid.</v>

716
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.630
<v Speaker 1>And so as the universe cooled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cosmic fluid,</v>

717
00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 1>which is everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these elementary particles,</v>

718
00:33:25.581 --> 00:33:29.210
<v Speaker 1>if you wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are permeating space suddenly found</v>

719
00:33:29.211 --> 00:33:34.211
<v Speaker 1>themselves preferring as the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool down to be in a certain </v>

720
00:33:34.211 --> 00:33:35.120
<v Speaker 1>configuration rather than another </v>
<v Speaker 1>configuration.</v>

721
00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it really is no different than the </v>

722
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:40.720
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary state of an icicle know </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

723
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.700
<v Speaker 1>It's just essentially as arbitrary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not magic and it's not as if you </v>

724
00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:50.381
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we in some sense the accidents of </v>

725
00:33:50.381 --> 00:33:54.381
<v Speaker 1>what the dust that's on your window and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wind that's blowing and everything </v>

726
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:55.940
<v Speaker 1>else is going to determine what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that pattern looks like,</v>

727
00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.860
<v Speaker 1>but every day if you had a new cold day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the icicle pattern would look different.</v>

728
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if every day you'd have the </v>

729
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:08.831
<v Speaker 1>same icicle pattern on your window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be different and that's what I </v>

730
00:34:08.831 --> 00:34:12.161
<v Speaker 1>mean by an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if the laws of physics at </v>

731
00:34:12.161 --> 00:34:15.011
<v Speaker 1>some level of couldn't have told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you knew all the configurations </v>

732
00:34:15.011 --> 00:34:15.560
<v Speaker 1>on that day why would look one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

733
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's not significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess what I mean,</v>

734
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:22.930
<v Speaker 1>there's no special significance to that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern that meant God meant it to be </v>

735
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:26.390
<v Speaker 1>and there's no special significance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe in which we live.</v>

736
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.980
<v Speaker 1>That meant God meant it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been quite different.</v>

737
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:34.190
<v Speaker 1>We should celebrate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite different because you and</v>

738
00:34:34.191 --> 00:34:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I can have this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a wonderful thing that it is the</v>

739
00:34:37.791 --> 00:34:41.510
<v Speaker 1>way it is and let's celebrate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're that we've evolved and I can still</v>

740
00:34:41.511 --> 00:34:42.410
<v Speaker 1>say that word in this country.</v>

741
00:34:42.410 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 1>We've evolved a consciousness so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can appreciate all of the wonders of the</v>

742
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:52.361
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's celebrate that so it doesn't mean </v>

743
00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:52.361
<v Speaker 1>we're meaningless just because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe has no purpose.</v>

744
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:57.490
<v Speaker 1>We make our own purpose in our own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means to me in some sense that life </v>

745
00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:01.721
<v Speaker 1>is more purposeful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There isn't someone pulling the strings </v>

746
00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:04.990
<v Speaker 1>were pulling the strings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's okay to live in a </v>

747
00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.890
<v Speaker 1>purposeless universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make life worse.</v>

748
00:35:06.891 --> 00:35:11.891
<v Speaker 1>It makes it much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just always ascribed significance to </v>

749
00:35:11.891 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 1>things that happened to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The physicist Richard Feynman used to,</v>

750
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.550
<v Speaker 1>used to go up to people and he used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

751
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.870
<v Speaker 1>you won't believe what happened to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

752
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.580
<v Speaker 1>You won't believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people say,</v>

753
00:35:19.581 --> 00:35:22.040
<v Speaker 1>why do you say absolutely nothing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

754
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Because when things happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly they're significant.</v>

755
00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a million crazy dreams and then</v>

756
00:35:28.371 --> 00:35:30.230
<v Speaker 1>one night you dream that your friend is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to break their arm.</v>

757
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:31.460
<v Speaker 1>The next day they break their leg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

758
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm clairvoyant.</v>

759
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:35.730
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or he'll say that.</v>

760
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:36.800
<v Speaker 1>He'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

761
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.630
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a license plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

762
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't believe I just saw a </v>
<v Speaker 1>license plate.</v>

763
00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.570
<v Speaker 1>It wasj two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

764
00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:43.200
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

765
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:44.250
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you believe it?</v>

766
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a significant,</v>

767
00:35:48.101 --> 00:35:50.060
<v Speaker 1>a single license plate that says one </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

768
00:35:50.061 --> 00:35:50.330
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

769
00:35:50.331 --> 00:35:50.720
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

770
00:35:50.721 --> 00:35:52.200
<v Speaker 1>one or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a license plate that says,</v>

771
00:35:52.201 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>I am God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

772
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:59.300
<v Speaker 1>They're all just as significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the things that appear to mean </v>

773
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.571
<v Speaker 1>something to us suddenly take on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance because we're hardwired to </v>

774
00:36:02.571 --> 00:36:04.620
<v Speaker 1>want to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the x file said,</v>

775
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.200
<v Speaker 1>we want to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all want to believe we are.</v>

776
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:09.600
<v Speaker 1>We're hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But well,</v>

777
00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.740
<v Speaker 1>here's the reason we want to ascribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ascribe meaning to everything.</v>

778
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason for that.</v>

779
00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.680
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a,</v>

780
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an early modern human on the Savanna in </v>

781
00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.951
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leaves can be rustling in the trees </v>

782
00:36:27.951 --> 00:36:27.951
<v Speaker 1>next to you.</v>

783
00:36:27.951 --> 00:36:27.951
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

784
00:36:27.951 --> 00:36:30.870
<v Speaker 1>no reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he can say maybe there's a lion there</v>

785
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.680
<v Speaker 1>and what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so maybe there's a line causing maybe </v>

786
00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.591
<v Speaker 1>there's a cause for that happening now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that those of our potential ancestors </v>

787
00:36:39.601 --> 00:36:44.601
<v Speaker 1>that said isn't a reason they got eaten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that didn't are the ones that </v>

788
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:48.180
<v Speaker 1>we produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

789
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:53.190
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense we're kind of hard </v>

790
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:54.690
<v Speaker 1>wired by evolution to want to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose and meaning and everything,</v>

791
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.240
<v Speaker 1>but isn't that just recognizing danger </v>
<v Speaker 1>or potential danger?</v>

792
00:36:57.241 --> 00:36:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

793
00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.240
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

794
00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.940
<v Speaker 1>but have side effect of anticipating </v>
<v Speaker 1>danger is to ascribe significance to </v>

795
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:11.931
<v Speaker 1>things that may not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're much luckier if you're much </v>

796
00:37:11.931 --> 00:37:15.680
<v Speaker 1>luckier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're much more likely to survive </v>

797
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:15.690
<v Speaker 1>if you ascribed significance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

798
00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps in the early days then if he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbing significance to nothing.</v>

799
00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.660
<v Speaker 1>But when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about significance,</v>

800
00:37:21.661 --> 00:37:26.661
<v Speaker 1>essentially you're talking about divine </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance about it can be divine </v>

801
00:37:26.661 --> 00:37:27.690
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can just be.</v>

802
00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You can think there's more more to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>than meets the eye.</v>

803
00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're talking about </v>

804
00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:37.581
<v Speaker 1>clairvoyance or when you talk about some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a divine intervention by a </v>

805
00:37:37.581 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 1>deity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about something powerful.</v>

806
00:37:40.081 --> 00:37:43.320
<v Speaker 1>This is the one that is meant to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader of this tribe,</v>

807
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.240
<v Speaker 1>but that's the consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

808
00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it works at all levels.</v>

809
00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.800
<v Speaker 1>It works at all levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the fact that the leaves are </v>

810
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.590
<v Speaker 1>rustling and it means that line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once we have that hard wired thing,</v>

811
00:37:52.591 --> 00:37:54.400
<v Speaker 1>then we want to be then our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

812
00:37:54.401 --> 00:37:56.750
<v Speaker 1>our desire to believe continues and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

813
00:37:56.830 --> 00:38:01.830
<v Speaker 1>and social beings may be found that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they imposed some meaning on the </v>

814
00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:03.810
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a universe which otherwise is hostile</v>

815
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.960
<v Speaker 1>and dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe it might help bind them in </v>

816
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:12.471
<v Speaker 1>tribes that maybe would help Mike make </v>
<v Speaker 1>them happier about being alive early on </v>

817
00:38:12.471 --> 00:38:15.000
<v Speaker 1>because they might be so scared of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe that wants to kill them all the</v>

818
00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:16.950
<v Speaker 1>time that it would bolden them.</v>

819
00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.470
<v Speaker 1>So there's obviously an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose to,</v>

820
00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.860
<v Speaker 1>to what is religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if there wasn't,</v>

821
00:38:22.861 --> 00:38:24.180
<v Speaker 1>religions wouldn't be everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

822
00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean pretty well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All human cultures have religions.</v>

823
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Each one is inconsistent with every </v>
<v Speaker 1>other one.</v>

824
00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.290
<v Speaker 1>But which was the reason we know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably all wrong,</v>

825
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:36.280
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it works the that it's universal,</v>

826
00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:40.840
<v Speaker 1>must mean there's some evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>utility to the believing,</v>

827
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.680
<v Speaker 1>but then certain things eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they worked and were useful </v>

828
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.370
<v Speaker 1>early on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as our human condition changes,</v>

829
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.380
<v Speaker 1>they may not be so useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

830
00:38:50.381 --> 00:38:53.200
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be the place where we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>at now as a civilization.</v>

831
00:38:53.201 --> 00:38:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

832
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that religion is turning </v>
<v Speaker 1>out to be counterproductive.</v>

833
00:38:56.741 --> 00:39:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Now it may have been useful early on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history,</v>

834
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 1>but now what it's doing is it's getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way,</v>

835
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:07.201
<v Speaker 1>not only of progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but have a few in cooperation and so </v>

836
00:39:07.201 --> 00:39:11.530
<v Speaker 1>evolution is now is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive.</v>

837
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.920
<v Speaker 1>But the great thing is we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a consciousness.</v>

838
00:39:14.921 --> 00:39:19.921
<v Speaker 1>We have an intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can actually overcome that </v>

839
00:39:19.921 --> 00:39:23.160
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary predilection by realizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have that predilection and as as </v>

840
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:27.231
<v Speaker 1>firemen said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the easiest person to fool is </v>

841
00:39:27.231 --> 00:39:27.600
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a scientist,</v>

842
00:39:27.601 --> 00:39:30.640
<v Speaker 1>what you have to do is ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I believing that?</v>

843
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Because I want to believer because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's evidence.</v>

844
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:36.130
<v Speaker 1>So if we constantly are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are skeptical of ourselves,</v>

845
00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.960
<v Speaker 1>we can know to overcome that ingrained </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse,</v>

846
00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:43.990
<v Speaker 1>we have to want to believe that's one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the utilities of science.</v>

847
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.670
<v Speaker 1>So I may listen to you and like you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I may listen to another radio person and</v>

848
00:39:48.671 --> 00:39:52.680
<v Speaker 1>not like them and I may be therefore </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally willing to assume that they're</v>

849
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.540
<v Speaker 1>wrong and you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I should also say to myself,</v>

850
00:39:56.380 --> 00:40:01.380
<v Speaker 1>is it really the case or is it just </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I like Joe Rogan and I don't </v>

851
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:01.380
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

852
00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.110
<v Speaker 1>you pick your favorite right wing nut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

853
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:02.920
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

854
00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.680
<v Speaker 1>and so we should be asking ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

855
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:08.890
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should go beyond my </v>
<v Speaker 1>predilections,</v>

856
00:40:09.070 --> 00:40:14.070
<v Speaker 1>me on my biases to ask why I am </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic to what I'm hearing.</v>

857
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:19.970
<v Speaker 1>And if we did that in everyday life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we cut through the crap more </v>

858
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.970
<v Speaker 1>carefully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So science says,</v>

859
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:24.781
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are hardwired to want to have these </v>

860
00:40:24.781 --> 00:40:25.780
<v Speaker 1>weird beliefs and it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some of them are right,</v>

861
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.760
<v Speaker 1>but the only way to know is to test </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

862
00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.860
<v Speaker 1>If we're not willing to contest our </v>
<v Speaker 1>beliefs and subject them to that,</v>

863
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:37.190
<v Speaker 1>the test of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then then we're going to be diluted and </v>

864
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:39.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the problem with that with a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's happening in our government.</v>

865
00:40:39.221 --> 00:40:40.480
<v Speaker 1>People saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

866
00:40:40.481 --> 00:40:45.481
<v Speaker 1>I really want to believe in this absurd </v>
<v Speaker 1>story and therefore I refuse to accept </v>

867
00:40:46.211 --> 00:40:46.940
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're the.</v>

868
00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.430
<v Speaker 1>If you're Mike Pence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vice president,</v>

869
00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:49.270
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

870
00:40:49.271 --> 00:40:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe evolution because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

871
00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't agree with my ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist ideas.</v>

872
00:40:54.161 --> 00:40:55.600
<v Speaker 1>And he said that in Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

873
00:40:55.601 --> 00:41:00.601
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be teaching evolution in </v>

874
00:41:00.601 --> 00:41:00.601
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be teaching intelligent design</v>

875
00:41:00.601 --> 00:41:01.690
<v Speaker 1>and and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because he,</v>

876
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:02.300
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

877
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:07.860
<v Speaker 1>it offends his personal faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps it might also be a political </v>

878
00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:12.151
<v Speaker 1>ploy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be a thing because he knows </v>

879
00:41:12.151 --> 00:41:13.921
<v Speaker 1>that a large percentage of the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>finds comfort in a leader that </v>

880
00:41:13.921 --> 00:41:15.550
<v Speaker 1>subscribes to the same sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstitions that they do.</v>

881
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

882
00:41:16.010 --> 00:41:17.470
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be a.</v>

883
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.420
<v Speaker 1>He did this before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was in a national office.</v>

884
00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:21.900
<v Speaker 1>He was a congressman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect he did it.</v>

885
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:23.870
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like he believed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're right.</v>

886
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

887
00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.350
<v Speaker 1>but at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that we,</v>

888
00:41:28.351 --> 00:41:30.830
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should realize that the only that,</v>

889
00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:35.510
<v Speaker 1>that we shouldn't listen to that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense because we may not want,</v>

890
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:38.720
<v Speaker 1>because there are a lot of people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country who do think that evolution</v>

891
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.930
<v Speaker 1>directly confronts their belief in God </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Big Bang directly confronts their</v>

892
00:41:44.121 --> 00:41:47.480
<v Speaker 1>belief in God and therefore they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want their children to learn about that.</v>

893
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:52.930
<v Speaker 1>But what an awful thing to do to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children to withhold evidence about how </v>

894
00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:57.791
<v Speaker 1>the world really works because you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to believe in the big </v>

895
00:41:57.791 --> 00:41:57.791
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really happened.</v>

896
00:41:57.791 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to believe in evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it happened.</v>

897
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.950
<v Speaker 1>It's like Philip K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick said,</v>

898
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 1>the science fiction writer reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that which continues to exist.</v>

899
00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:06.770
<v Speaker 1>Whether or not you believe in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

900
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.920
<v Speaker 1>and so you may not want to believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

901
00:42:09.921 --> 00:42:10.790
<v Speaker 1>but it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

902
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:16.070
<v Speaker 1>and for you to withhold that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge from your kids because you're </v>

903
00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.060
<v Speaker 1>worried it's gonna Affect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their faith is,</v>

904
00:42:17.061 --> 00:42:22.061
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>child abuse because you're hindering </v>

905
00:42:22.061 --> 00:42:24.581
<v Speaker 1>their capabilities as an adult in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>society which is highly technological to</v>

906
00:42:24.681 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 1>function effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it because they believe in</v>

907
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:28.610
<v Speaker 1>as well and they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

908
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm not believing they think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping their kids,</v>

909
00:42:30.831 --> 00:42:32.510
<v Speaker 1>but most of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you're a parent.</v>

910
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.340
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all screwed up our kids,</v>

911
00:42:34.341 --> 00:42:36.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all do things for our kids because we</v>

912
00:42:36.741 --> 00:42:40.400
<v Speaker 1>think it's good for them and sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is and sometimes it isn't.</v>

913
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying these people are doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they.</v>

914
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:46.340
<v Speaker 1>They want to hurt their children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think somehow that not believing in</v>

915
00:42:46.341 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 1>God makes you a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

916
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.450
<v Speaker 1>But there's no evidence of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

917
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:51.920
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Weinberg,</v>

918
00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.810
<v Speaker 1>who was a Nobel prize winning physicist </v>
<v Speaker 1>has said,</v>

919
00:42:53.811 --> 00:42:54.410
<v Speaker 1>and I love it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

920
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:55.130
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

921
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.830
<v Speaker 1>so they're good people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're bad people.</v>

922
00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Good people do good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad people do bad things.</v>

923
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:02.810
<v Speaker 1>When good people do bad things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's religion.</v>

924
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:09.250
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that religion in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>earliest stages was in a sense primitive</v>

925
00:43:10.011 --> 00:43:15.011
<v Speaker 1>man with no science trying to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and trying to have some sort </v>

926
00:43:15.231 --> 00:43:20.231
<v Speaker 1>of rules like almost like a scaffolding </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to to move to the next?</v>

927
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.900
<v Speaker 1>If you see that it exists in so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different cultures,</v>

928
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:27.170
<v Speaker 1>it might have been something along the </v>
<v Speaker 1>course that way.</v>

929
00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:32.171
<v Speaker 1>Was there effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was their effort to understand the </v>

930
00:43:32.171 --> 00:43:32.171
<v Speaker 1>world around them based on what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew it was noble.</v>

931
00:43:32.171 --> 00:43:37.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to understand the world and </v>

932
00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.611
<v Speaker 1>so there's nothing wrong with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but claiming that we today should be </v>

933
00:43:39.611 --> 00:43:42.950
<v Speaker 1>guided by the worldview of of illiterate</v>
<v Speaker 1>peasants in the Iron Age.</v>

934
00:43:42.951 --> 00:43:47.951
<v Speaker 1>Peasants who who didn't know the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>orbiting the sun and wrote down </v>

935
00:43:47.951 --> 00:43:51.940
<v Speaker 1>scriptures based on their beliefs at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time they argue that that should guide </v>

936
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.481
<v Speaker 1>our life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today when we discovered 100 billion </v>

937
00:43:55.481 --> 00:43:55.940
<v Speaker 1>galaxies in the universe and discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff is ludicrous.</v>

938
00:43:55.941 --> 00:44:00.530
<v Speaker 1>So you're absolutely the birth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and religion are the same and in</v>

939
00:44:00.531 --> 00:44:02.180
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern science grew out of religion.</v>

940
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:03.620
<v Speaker 1>People point that out and they send to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

941
00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:05.630
<v Speaker 1>how dare you talk about religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

942
00:44:05.631 --> 00:44:07.010
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being outdated.</v>

943
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Science grew out of religion and I say </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them,</v>

944
00:44:09.951 --> 00:44:12.590
<v Speaker 1>well that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but children outgrow their parents,</v>

945
00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So great.</v>

946
00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:20.320
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Religious ideas and all our early </v>

947
00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:23.381
<v Speaker 1>scientists were religious because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only game in town you couldn't be </v>

948
00:44:23.381 --> 00:44:26.531
<v Speaker 1>educated except the church controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the universities and so it was like </v>

949
00:44:26.531 --> 00:44:28.100
<v Speaker 1>the National Science Foundation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>16th century.</v>

950
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:33.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising they were all </v>
<v Speaker 1>religious because that's that the only </v>

951
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.471
<v Speaker 1>game in town so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ca helped create the birth of </v>

952
00:44:36.471 --> 00:44:38.100
<v Speaker 1>modern science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But science outgrew it and that's okay.</v>

953
00:44:38.101 --> 00:44:40.200
<v Speaker 1>Kids outgrow their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank goodness.</v>

954
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe that might help kids </v>

955
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:48.471
<v Speaker 1>outgrow their parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why the getting religion forced down </v>

956
00:44:48.471 --> 00:44:50.130
<v Speaker 1>your throat is one of the best ways for </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids to,</v>

957
00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.050
<v Speaker 1>for suggested as they get older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Son,</v>

958
00:44:52.051 --> 00:44:53.340
<v Speaker 1>for some kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids like you and me.</v>

959
00:44:53.341 --> 00:44:55.320
<v Speaker 1>But I get lots of letters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

960
00:44:55.380 --> 00:45:00.380
<v Speaker 1>we made this movie called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievers and and which followed </v>

961
00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins and I around the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>as we talked about this stuff.</v>

962
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:04.680
<v Speaker 1>And it was nice and maybe I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hope and it's a,</v>

963
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a well made film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the filmmakers have made it,</v>

964
00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:11.730
<v Speaker 1>but I found people come up to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea of this.</v>

965
00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:14.460
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the negative aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion that I never appreciated.</v>

966
00:45:16.050 --> 00:45:18.390
<v Speaker 1>I have people come up and he almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday I write me and saying,</v>

967
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:23.391
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that movie and I realized I'm not </v>

968
00:45:23.391 --> 00:45:24.570
<v Speaker 1>a bad person for asking questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not alone.</v>

969
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people from small towns in </v>

970
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:29.960
<v Speaker 1>Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no one to talk to.</v>

971
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.470
<v Speaker 1>They think that the only ones who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked the question is God real?</v>

972
00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Is it okay to not believe in God?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're told by everyone else you'll</v>

973
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.750
<v Speaker 1>not only you'll go to hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're a bad person.</v>

974
00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:39.750
<v Speaker 1>And suddenly they discover that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

975
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.870
<v Speaker 1>And so I think there are a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have that forced down their throats.</v>

976
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:46.880
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard when you're a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know and have these.</v>

977
00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.320
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I do think any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion for kids,</v>

978
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:51.690
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of child abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a no matter what,</v>

979
00:45:51.691 --> 00:45:56.691
<v Speaker 1>because these concepts have a daily and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the possible existence of a purpose of </v>

980
00:45:56.691 --> 00:46:01.050
<v Speaker 1>the universe are very deep and subtle </v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts and expect a three year old kid</v>

981
00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.230
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

982
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:07.630
<v Speaker 1>to the ram that down a curial kid's </v>
<v Speaker 1>throat is unfair because the kid </v>

983
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:07.630
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resident,</v>

984
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 1>it ends up being internalized in ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people,</v>

985
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:15.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hear a lot of people who've had deep </v>

986
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:15.470
<v Speaker 1>religious educations who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:16.350
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to outgrow that because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>

988
00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:21.500
<v Speaker 1>when that's thrust into you as a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to over ever overcome </v>

989
00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.731
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guilt feelings that many religions </v>

990
00:46:25.731 --> 00:46:26.580
<v Speaker 1>introduce the fundamental notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

991
00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:31.140
<v Speaker 1>you're ultimately sinful and no matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is sinful,</v>

992
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:36.290
<v Speaker 1>is something a lot of people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard times within that claim of sin is </v>

993
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.350
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've debated people who,</v>

994
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:42.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who argue that homosexuality is sinful,</v>

995
00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

996
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:45.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's unnatural.</v>

997
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:47.940
<v Speaker 1>God intended it to be otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I pointed out,</v>

998
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:48.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

999
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:51.990
<v Speaker 1>you take all mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 percent in every species,</v>

1000
00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:54.630
<v Speaker 1>almost 10 percent have homosexual </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships.</v>

1001
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Sheep have long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of sheep have longterm </v>

1002
00:46:59.960 --> 00:46:59.960
<v Speaker 1>homosexual relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they sinful.</v>

1003
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a natural at all.</v>

1004
00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural consequence of whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now why it's a case,</v>

1005
00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:07.110
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting evolution in </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

1006
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly not a natural and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems uniform than if it's 10 percent.</v>

1007
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.580
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well being a plus or minus a little bit,</v>

1008
00:47:12.581 --> 00:47:15.420
<v Speaker 1>it certainly seems to be biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some purpose,</v>

1009
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:18.300
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some biological purpose to it.</v>

1010
00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:23.720
<v Speaker 1>And so to argue that it's both unnatural</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wrong is to misunderstand biology.</v>

1011
00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.840
<v Speaker 1>But people grow up being told it's evil </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the Bible said it right?</v>

1012
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:35.070
<v Speaker 1>And then they don't want to give people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are homosexual the same rights as </v>

1013
00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:38.341
<v Speaker 1>other people because they tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say God didn't want them to have </v>

1014
00:47:38.341 --> 00:47:41.101
<v Speaker 1>the officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is people are told these </v>

1015
00:47:41.101 --> 00:47:42.220
<v Speaker 1>things that are ultimately wrong because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1016
00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:44.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for whatever reason,</v>

1017
00:47:44.321 --> 00:47:49.300
<v Speaker 1>the tribe that wrote down that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>scripture wanted to make sure that there</v>

1018
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 1>weren't homosexual relationships in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

1019
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:52.090
<v Speaker 1>which just really</v>

1020
00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:57.180
<v Speaker 2>baffling when you talk to people about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Bible in the Old Testament versus </v>

1021
00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.470
<v Speaker 2>the new testament and they don't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand where the new testament was </v>

1022
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 2>created by Constantine and a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bishops they throw up.</v>

1023
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:03.360
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think it's kinder,</v>

1024
00:48:03.361 --> 00:48:03.930
<v Speaker 1>gentler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1025
00:48:03.931 --> 00:48:06.420
<v Speaker 1>The Old Testament is one of the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1026
00:48:06.421 --> 00:48:08.670
<v Speaker 1>look at the current people say the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qur'an is violent and vicious.</v>

1027
00:48:08.671 --> 00:48:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Read the Old Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1028
00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:12.270
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to stone your kids if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they disobey you.</v>

1029
00:48:12.310 --> 00:48:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1030
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.350
<v Speaker 1>and the reason killed people that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>two different kinds of clauses.</v>

1031
00:48:15.351 --> 00:48:18.390
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason that nowadays,</v>

1032
00:48:18.391 --> 00:48:23.391
<v Speaker 1>sort of the Abrahamic religions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Judaism and Christianity may seem a </v>

1033
00:48:23.391 --> 00:48:25.140
<v Speaker 1>little less violent than Islam for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is because,</v>

1034
00:48:25.141 --> 00:48:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people take the Quran literally,</v>

1035
00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's part of sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist Islam.</v>

1036
00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Very few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people take the Bible as </v>

1037
00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:37.560
<v Speaker 1>literally as namely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1038
00:48:37.561 --> 00:48:40.680
<v Speaker 1>we're going to stone kids in the twelfth</v>
<v Speaker 1>century they may have,</v>

1039
00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:46.160
<v Speaker 1>but now we've outgrown it and the is 600</v>
<v Speaker 1>years younger and so it's just the old </v>

1040
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:48.450
<v Speaker 1>testament is just as violent as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean,</v>

1041
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:50.040
<v Speaker 1>but no one takes it seriously.</v>

1042
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:55.430
<v Speaker 1>But people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people who call themselves </v>

1043
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.991
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pick and choose the things they </v>

1044
00:48:56.991 --> 00:48:56.991
<v Speaker 1>like from the Bible or the New Testament</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the old testament.</v>

1045
00:48:56.991 --> 00:48:59.910
<v Speaker 1>They pick and choose the nice kindler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentler things.</v>

1046
00:48:59.911 --> 00:49:04.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins Foundation in England </v>

1047
00:49:04.911 --> 00:49:04.960
<v Speaker 1>did an interesting survey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1048
00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.260
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British government does a census,</v>

1049
00:49:07.261 --> 00:49:08.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1050
00:49:08.081 --> 00:49:10.170
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked people's religions as part of</v>

1051
00:49:10.171 --> 00:49:11.490
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the last census,</v>

1052
00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:15.000
<v Speaker 1>remarkably only 55 percent of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>said they were Christian church,</v>

1053
00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Church of England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the lowest ever but </v>

1054
00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:20.060
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to those 55 percent people.</v>

1055
00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.210
<v Speaker 1>They did a survey of those and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1056
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:22.620
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you call yourself Christian?</v>

1057
00:49:22.621 --> 00:49:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe in the Virgin birth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe in transubstantiation?</v>

1058
00:49:25.321 --> 00:49:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Do believe in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1059
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and went down the list and people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1060
00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:28.350
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1061
00:49:28.351 --> 00:49:28.830
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1062
00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.650
<v Speaker 1>And then they'd ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you call yourself Christian?</v>

1063
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And the answer was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to think of ourselves as good </v>

1064
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.650
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so religion is usurped,</v>

1065
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:41.561
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somehow people throw out all of the </v>

1066
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:42.780
<v Speaker 1>evil and it's not just the old </v>
<v Speaker 1>testament.</v>

1067
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.050
<v Speaker 1>No one talks about hell more than Jesus </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

1068
00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus guy is supposed to love.</v>

1069
00:49:47.821 --> 00:49:52.821
<v Speaker 1>Everyone talked about hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This eternal damnation for people who </v>

1070
00:49:52.821 --> 00:49:52.821
<v Speaker 1>disobey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

1071
00:49:52.821 --> 00:49:54.420
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Christopher hitchins used to say,</v>

1072
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:59.630
<v Speaker 1>God is like a cosmic Saddam Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but worse because Saddam Hussein was </v>

1073
00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.380
<v Speaker 1>just torture his enemies while they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>

1074
00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.770
<v Speaker 1>God has worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He takes the people that I was liking,</v>

1075
00:50:03.790 --> 00:50:06.540
<v Speaker 1>torches them from all eternity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who wants such a God?</v>

1076
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:11.310
<v Speaker 1>What an awful disgusting idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife bought the sauna thing.</v>

1077
00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to thing.</v>

1078
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:17.380
<v Speaker 2>It's like a sauna suit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Zip it up and you hit these buttons </v>

1079
00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:18.890
<v Speaker 2>and it heats it up and heats your body </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature up neat.</v>

1080
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:23.950
<v Speaker 2>And it comes from China and it has this </v>
<v Speaker 2>hilarious instruction manual because </v>

1081
00:50:24.111 --> 00:50:26.960
<v Speaker 2>it's translated from Chinese to English </v>
<v Speaker 2>by people that are not.</v>

1082
00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:27.720
<v Speaker 2>I love.</v>

1083
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.810
<v Speaker 3>Every time I read one of those manuals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love him.</v>

1084
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.900
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like make waste of body,</v>

1085
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:35.600
<v Speaker 3>go away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>excels to fat,</v>

1086
00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:38.180
<v Speaker 3>disappear like very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very strange stuff.</v>

1087
00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:39.860
<v Speaker 3>And she was laughing and she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>reading.</v>

1088
00:50:39.861 --> 00:50:40.880
<v Speaker 3>She handed it to me and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1089
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:45.881
<v Speaker 3>this is the problem with the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the big problems in the Bible is </v>

1090
00:50:45.881 --> 00:50:46.770
<v Speaker 3>translating from ancient Hebrew and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Aramaic.</v>

1091
00:50:46.771 --> 00:50:49.130
<v Speaker 3>And some cases we have not even hit the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dead Sea Scrolls,</v>

1092
00:50:49.370 --> 00:50:52.820
<v Speaker 3>but ancient Hebrew,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the letters doubled his numbers.</v>

1093
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.880
<v Speaker 3>So there was no number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when the letter a is the number one </v>

1094
00:50:57.880 --> 00:50:58.370
<v Speaker 3>and words also had numerical</v>

1095
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:59.780
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you think about,</v>

1096
00:50:59.781 --> 00:51:00.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

1097
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 1>if you've ever actually ever looked at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1098
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people say the Bible,</v>

1099
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:05.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the word of God.</v>

1100
00:51:05.690 --> 00:51:07.700
<v Speaker 1>But then realize that this came by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1101
00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:12.810
<v Speaker 1>the King James version was decided by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people who decided what to </v>

1102
00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:15.160
<v Speaker 1>throw out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were parts of the of their earlier</v>

1103
00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Bible they didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They threw out.</v>

1104
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:20.090
<v Speaker 1>They determined what is now the Old </v>
<v Speaker 1>Testament in the King James version,</v>

1105
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.460
<v Speaker 1>which was a bunch of people who got </v>
<v Speaker 1>together</v>

1106
00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.450
<v Speaker 3>and decided to throw things out and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>to translate things and what to do.</v>

1107
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:29.480
<v Speaker 3>It was people just the word of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a bunch of a bunch of people.</v>

1108
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.000
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever heard of John Marco </v>
<v Speaker 3>Allegro?</v>

1109
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:33.410
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1110
00:51:33.411 --> 00:51:34.940
<v Speaker 3>I know a lot of people that want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow,</v>

1111
00:51:34.941 --> 00:51:38.960
<v Speaker 3>but grow is one of the scholars that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

1112
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:44.080
<v Speaker 3>He was one of the people that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls and he </v>

1113
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:47.330
<v Speaker 3>wrote a book in the 19 seventies called </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sacred mushroom and the cross.</v>

1114
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.360
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard of the book is his </v>

1115
00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.710
<v Speaker 3>determination after 14 years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls at the </v>

1116
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:57.251
<v Speaker 3>entire Christian religion was a massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>misunderstanding that it was really all </v>

1117
00:51:57.251 --> 00:51:57.530
<v Speaker 3>about consumption of psychedelic </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms.</v>

1118
00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.210
<v Speaker 3>Fertility cults.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1119
00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:00.680
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm skeptical of that,</v>

1120
00:52:00.681 --> 00:52:02.030
<v Speaker 3>I should say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm skeptical of everything.</v>

1121
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:03.380
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating.</v>

1122
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:06.320
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of people who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>written really interesting books.</v>

1123
00:52:06.321 --> 00:52:07.440
<v Speaker 1>On the early history of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1124
00:52:07.441 --> 00:52:09.970
<v Speaker 1>of the Christian religion and Judaism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1125
00:52:09.971 --> 00:52:14.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a number of those scholars that </v>

1126
00:52:14.971 --> 00:52:14.971
<v Speaker 1>it's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

1127
00:52:14.971 --> 00:52:17.830
<v Speaker 1>there's really great evidence that Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't even divide in the early </v>

1128
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1129
00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Mean his divinity came about 300 layers </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

1130
00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:22.700
<v Speaker 1>It's some really interesting work and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

1131
00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:27.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion is evolved and we now take it </v>

1132
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:31.721
<v Speaker 1>as if it was sort of was obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently according to the books I've </v>

1133
00:52:31.881 --> 00:52:34.760
<v Speaker 1>been reading lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really good evidence that,</v>

1134
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:39.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only did Jesus never called himself </v>

1135
00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:39.790
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his followers never did either.</v>

1136
00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:39.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

1137
00:52:39.891 --> 00:52:44.891
<v Speaker 1>and this resurrection thing was put in </v>
<v Speaker 1>later when people want it to make him </v>

1138
00:52:44.891 --> 00:52:44.891
<v Speaker 1>divine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1139
00:52:44.891 --> 00:52:46.910
<v Speaker 1>And so that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

1140
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:49.370
<v Speaker 1>you could be skeptical about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be skeptical of everything.</v>

1141
00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.820
<v Speaker 1>But what's really amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what bothers me,</v>

1142
00:52:52.821 --> 00:52:57.821
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a piece for the New Yorker once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said all scientists should be </v>

1143
00:52:57.821 --> 00:52:57.821
<v Speaker 1>militant atheist.</v>

1144
00:52:57.821 --> 00:52:59.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were really criticized for that.</v>

1145
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.560
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I by some,</v>

1146
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:02.930
<v Speaker 3>by some people and the first praised by </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

1147
00:53:02.931 --> 00:53:03.150
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1148
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:05.190
<v Speaker 1>But the real point is that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized me,</v>

1149
00:53:05.191 --> 00:53:10.191
<v Speaker 1>never read the piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which often happens for my work because </v>

1150
00:53:10.191 --> 00:53:11.100
<v Speaker 1>there was the title and the editor chose</v>
<v Speaker 1>the title,</v>

1151
00:53:11.101 --> 00:53:12.990
<v Speaker 1>which is fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't.</v>

1152
00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:17.250
<v Speaker 1>But what I said was when I simply asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>

1153
00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:20.280
<v Speaker 1>could it be that Jesus was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I just said,</v>

1154
00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:25.310
<v Speaker 1>could it be that Jesus wasn't always </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered divine in the Christian </v>

1155
00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:25.310
<v Speaker 1>religion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1156
00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 1>a scholarly question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When asked the question,</v>

1157
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:28.740
<v Speaker 1>in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm called a militant atheist.</v>

1158
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 1>How dare you question our doctrine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1159
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:37.020
<v Speaker 1>if nothing should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be above questioning,</v>

1160
00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.470
<v Speaker 1>nothing should in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing should be sacred.</v>

1161
00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Everything should be open to question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if simply questioning makes me a </v>

1162
00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:50.241
<v Speaker 1>militant atheist than all scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be melted atheist because we </v>

1163
00:53:50.241 --> 00:53:52.110
<v Speaker 1>should adore questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I wasn't arguing,</v>

1164
00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should be handing out pamphlets and I</v>

1165
00:53:55.261 --> 00:53:58.800
<v Speaker 1>said we should be asking questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the discussion you and I just had</v>

1166
00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.100
<v Speaker 1>would be viewed by some people and will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be viewed by some people as sinful </v>

1167
00:54:04.100 --> 00:54:06.450
<v Speaker 1>sacrilege.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A sacrilege should not be on the air,</v>

1168
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:11.570
<v Speaker 1>should not be allowed to have that </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion because how dare we </v>

1169
00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:15.020
<v Speaker 1>questioned the divinity of Jesus Christ </v>
<v Speaker 1>because after all he was God and to </v>

1170
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.750
<v Speaker 1>question his divinity is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to do the work of the devil,</v>

1171
00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:23.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's so sad because you know you </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be questioning</v>

1172
00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.760
<v Speaker 3>and it is fascinating where people draw </v>
<v Speaker 3>that line to whether they draw the line </v>

1173
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.181
<v Speaker 3>at the new testament or whether they go </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to the old testament or whether </v>

1174
00:54:32.181 --> 00:54:32.181
<v Speaker 3>they even bought.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1175
00:54:32.181 --> 00:54:34.380
<v Speaker 3>how many people are believers in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Dead Sea Scrolls?</v>

1176
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:39.560
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people have gone over the work </v>

1177
00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.140
<v Speaker 3>from Iran with a fine tooth comb?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly,</v>

1178
00:54:40.141 --> 00:54:41.640
<v Speaker 3>but by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like the word believer.</v>

1179
00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:45.260
<v Speaker 1>I should say that I use it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're a scientist,</v>

1180
00:54:45.261 --> 00:54:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you'd never use the word belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something's likely or unlikely,</v>

1181
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:53.930
<v Speaker 1>but that belief is not a part of the of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to think of rational </v>

1182
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.930
<v Speaker 1>inquiry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you can have.</v>

1183
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:55.400
<v Speaker 1>We all are colloquium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have beliefs,</v>

1184
00:54:55.401 --> 00:54:57.830
<v Speaker 1>which means we have preconceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1185
00:54:57.831 --> 00:55:02.831
<v Speaker 1>but really what we're saying is this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly likely based on what I think or </v>

1186
00:55:02.831 --> 00:55:03.110
<v Speaker 1>what I know before and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

1187
00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.080
<v Speaker 3>learn something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it make it more or less likely or I</v>

1188
00:55:06.081 --> 00:55:08.600
<v Speaker 3>respect that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a Ta,</v>

1189
00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I use the word belief all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I try not to.</v>

1190
00:55:11.031 --> 00:55:13.010
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things like the word,</v>

1191
00:55:13.011 --> 00:55:18.011
<v Speaker 3>like I try not to use like in sentences </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people like use it like way too </v>

1192
00:55:18.011 --> 00:55:18.670
<v Speaker 3>much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just got to be a way.</v>

1193
00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:20.570
<v Speaker 3>If you go to high school now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking kids.</v>

1194
00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:21.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1195
00:55:21.371 --> 00:55:26.371
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is strange to me that people do draw </v>

1196
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:27.800
<v Speaker 3>those arbitrary lines and when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>decide that doctrine is real,</v>

1197
00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:32.820
<v Speaker 3>like they'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you start talking to him about the </v>

1198
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Old Testament and they're trying to be a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Christian apologist,</v>

1199
00:55:33.141 --> 00:55:33.470
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1200
00:55:33.471 --> 00:55:38.471
<v Speaker 3>we'll listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about the old testament </v>

1201
00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:38.471
<v Speaker 3>and we don't go by that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We go by that thing.</v>

1202
00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:42.340
<v Speaker 3>That emperor of Rome created with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of bishops and he wasn't even </v>

1203
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:42.770
<v Speaker 3>Christian himself until he was on his </v>
<v Speaker 3>deathbed.</v>

1204
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:44.510
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know exactly and people,</v>

1205
00:55:44.511 --> 00:55:46.600
<v Speaker 3>but people like to define themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1206
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:47.520
<v Speaker 3>and I don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1207
00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:49.190
<v Speaker 3>it sounds patronizing as if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1208
00:55:49.191 --> 00:55:50.090
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1209
00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.100
<v Speaker 3>we're better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all believe crazy things.</v>

1210
00:55:52.101 --> 00:55:54.110
<v Speaker 3>You and I also did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We all were crazy leads.</v>

1211
00:55:54.111 --> 00:55:55.220
<v Speaker 3>You believe 10 in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1212
00:55:55.221 --> 00:55:57.080
<v Speaker 3>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's what we all believe in impossible</v>

1213
00:55:57.081 --> 00:56:02.081
<v Speaker 3>things before we get up for breakfast as</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lewis Carroll would you say you believe </v>

1214
00:56:02.081 --> 00:56:02.990
<v Speaker 3>that you'd like to do is carol are a big</v>
<v Speaker 3>proponent of acid?</v>

1215
00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:07.940
<v Speaker 3>Probably when he wrote it may be maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's lots of things,</v>

1216
00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.190
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea is interesting.</v>

1217
00:56:10.191 --> 00:56:13.310
<v Speaker 3>We all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans are not rational beings.</v>

1218
00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:16.770
<v Speaker 3>In order to make it through the day we </v>
<v Speaker 3>convince ourself of 10 impossible things</v>

1219
00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:19.100
<v Speaker 3>might be that you love your wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might be that you like your job,</v>

1220
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.970
<v Speaker 3>it might be what if you do love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live what you do,</v>

1221
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.960
<v Speaker 3>love your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lynn.</v>

1222
00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:23.920
<v Speaker 3>You do love your jobs.</v>

1223
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:25.150
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not impossible,</v>

1224
00:56:25.151 --> 00:56:26.470
<v Speaker 1>but there are other things that you may </v>
<v Speaker 1>find.</v>

1225
00:56:26.890 --> 00:56:29.800
<v Speaker 1>You may find you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could pick it.</v>

1226
00:56:29.801 --> 00:56:30.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1227
00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you might find that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1228
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:34.780
<v Speaker 1>that I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you believe anything weird?</v>

1229
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you.</v>

1230
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:42.331
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever explore it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I try some of the things I </v>

1231
00:56:42.331 --> 00:56:42.331
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a human being so,</v>

1232
00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.540
<v Speaker 1>so I make it through the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1233
00:56:44.650 --> 00:56:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I may convince myself I'm interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>

1234
00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Well that's nice but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1235
00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought you were interesting before I </v>

1236
00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:54.420
<v Speaker 1>met you and now you've confirmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh good.</v>

1237
00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I know,</v>

1238
00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:56.830
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1239
00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:57.850
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1240
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:03.210
<v Speaker 1>let me put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make convincing myself I'm handsome and </v>

1241
00:57:03.210 --> 00:57:03.870
<v Speaker 1>sexy and whatever it is that we all </v>
<v Speaker 1>convince ourselves with one of you,</v>

1242
00:57:03.871 --> 00:57:05.800
<v Speaker 1>if you were in a room full of 100 year </v>
<v Speaker 1>old dudes,</v>

1243
00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:07.210
<v Speaker 1>you'd be handsome and sexy but it.</v>

1244
00:57:07.230 --> 00:57:12.230
<v Speaker 1>But exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm in a room full of maybe not </v>

1245
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.920
<v Speaker 1>100 year old dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may not have issues,</v>

1246
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:15.430
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bunch of male models.</v>

1247
00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:16.690
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We say,</v>

1248
00:57:16.691 --> 00:57:17.530
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those male models.</v>

1249
00:57:17.531 --> 00:57:20.230
<v Speaker 1>But they looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's great.</v>

1250
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.030
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have your eyes wide open.</v>

1251
00:57:22.031 --> 00:57:27.031
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're comfortable enough in the </v>

1252
00:57:27.031 --> 00:57:27.031
<v Speaker 1>world's going to end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully part of growing up,</v>

1253
00:57:27.031 --> 00:57:31.710
<v Speaker 1>part of becoming an adult is learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of the ridiculous notions we </v>

1254
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:34.660
<v Speaker 1>had are just that and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with that.</v>

1255
00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.960
<v Speaker 1>That's part of maturing I think so when </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were now more comfortable in our own </v>

1256
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:40.120
<v Speaker 1>skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're able to accept those,</v>

1257
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:44.350
<v Speaker 1>but I bet when you were a teenager you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have had a harder time saying,</v>

1258
00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those other guys are better looking </v>

1259
00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Speaker 1>and more interesting than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1260
00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

1261
00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:54.480
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of growing up and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what science helps civilization do is </v>

1262
00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:54.970
<v Speaker 1>grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

1263
00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1264
00:57:57.730 --> 00:58:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that any of those bizarre </v>

1265
00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:03.250
<v Speaker 1>beliefs are important at all to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>

1266
00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:08.251
<v Speaker 1>Or do you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think society would function </v>

1267
00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.981
<v Speaker 1>if we all abandoned religion and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the people that have included it </v>

1268
00:58:10.981 --> 00:58:12.160
<v Speaker 1>as part of the sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1269
00:58:12.161 --> 00:58:17.161
<v Speaker 1>the scaffolding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they operate and this level who do </v>

1270
00:58:17.161 --> 00:58:19.951
<v Speaker 1>good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who there are people who are more </v>

1271
00:58:19.951 --> 00:58:20.290
<v Speaker 1>generous and give to charity because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>religion and help their neighbors and,</v>

1272
00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:21.420
<v Speaker 1>and go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1273
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:23.280
<v Speaker 1>at Christmas time go to soup kitchens </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

1274
00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:28.320
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they generally do genuinely do </v>

1275
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:28.490
<v Speaker 1>experience positive results from </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutely.</v>

1276
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as if religion breeds </v>

1277
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:34.150
<v Speaker 1>badness in everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what people should realize,</v>

1278
00:58:34.151 --> 00:58:37.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if the lack of religion </v>
<v Speaker 1>breeds badness is everyone.</v>

1279
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:39.100
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it necessary?</v>

1280
00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Altruism and kindness can exist on their</v>

1281
00:58:41.261 --> 00:58:42.190
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

1282
00:58:42.191 --> 00:58:45.190
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can do all of that.</v>

1283
00:58:45.191 --> 00:58:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And I know people who go to soup </v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchens at Christmas,</v>

1284
00:58:46.931 --> 00:58:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm who are atheists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is it's not necessary.</v>

1285
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:55.330
<v Speaker 1>So for some people it helps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that on average,</v>

1286
00:58:55.331 --> 00:59:00.331
<v Speaker 1>and this is where you can have a debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on average I would say the net </v>

1287
00:59:00.331 --> 00:59:02.800
<v Speaker 1>effect of religion is negative and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know colleagues of mine who some of whom</v>

1288
00:59:02.801 --> 00:59:07.801
<v Speaker 1>would disagree with me in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you look at the net </v>

1289
00:59:07.801 --> 00:59:09.931
<v Speaker 1>effect of religion on society and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>current world and maybe even over human </v>

1290
00:59:09.931 --> 00:59:13.951
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the net effect is is is negative and I </v>

1291
00:59:13.951 --> 00:59:16.750
<v Speaker 1>would argue you could probably get many </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the same features if we dispense with</v>

1292
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:21.780
<v Speaker 1>religion right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a problem because right now for </v>

1293
00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:24.151
<v Speaker 1>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion gives them a sense of </v>

1294
00:59:24.151 --> 00:59:27.191
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sense of belonging and maybe for a </v>

1295
00:59:27.191 --> 00:59:29.870
<v Speaker 1>sense of of of comfort it and death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things,</v>

1296
00:59:29.871 --> 00:59:31.540
<v Speaker 1>so we couldn't just sort of it.</v>

1297
00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.190
<v Speaker 1>It provides useful things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I said before,</v>

1298
00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.740
<v Speaker 1>it fulfills evolutionary purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't,</v>

1299
00:59:36.741 --> 00:59:40.850
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be so ubiquitous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can imagine at least a world where</v>

1300
00:59:40.851 --> 00:59:44.360
<v Speaker 1>we could fulfill those things in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1301
00:59:44.361 --> 00:59:45.640
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of picking,</v>

1302
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:48.320
<v Speaker 1>bringing people together for church </v>
<v Speaker 1>every Sunday,</v>

1303
00:59:48.321 --> 00:59:50.420
<v Speaker 1>we could bring them together for a rock </v>
<v Speaker 1>concert every Sunday.</v>

1304
00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'd get the same sense committee </v>

1305
00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:55.890
<v Speaker 1>or maybe for quantum mechanics class </v>
<v Speaker 1>every Sunday,</v>

1306
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:58.400
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they might find it fun if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was we made a quantum leap,</v>

1307
00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:03.520
<v Speaker 1>but they'd find a central or maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd find a sense of community and </v>

1308
01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:06.461
<v Speaker 1>everyone rolling their eyes just like </v>
<v Speaker 1>you did now because I suspect that </v>

1309
01:00:06.461 --> 01:00:06.500
<v Speaker 1>happens in church a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

1310
01:00:06.610 --> 01:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Will sunset sense of community is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to bond people and bring them </v>

1311
01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>together and religion does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

1312
01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is what bothers me is when</v>

1313
01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:14.090
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1314
01:00:14.091 --> 01:00:17.510
<v Speaker 1>therefore we need religion and the and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the answers may be now,</v>

1315
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:22.070
<v Speaker 1>but could we imagine building a sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>community because we care about our each</v>

1316
01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>other and we have a commonality in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

1317
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that makes science </v>
<v Speaker 1>so wonderful,</v>

1318
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've called the large Hadron Collider,</v>

1319
01:00:28.911 --> 01:00:33.911
<v Speaker 1>the Gothic Cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 21st century because the gothic </v>

1320
01:00:33.911 --> 01:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>cathedrals were built in the 11th or </v>
<v Speaker 1>twelfth century by thousands of artisans</v>

1321
01:00:35.451 --> 01:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>over centuries working together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had different languages,</v>

1322
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>different cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different religions may be not so many </v>

1323
01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>different religions back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they work together.</v>

1324
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>This large Hadron collider is built by </v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

1325
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:50.450
<v Speaker 1>scientists from over 100 different </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries with different languages,</v>

1326
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>different religions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're working together.</v>

1327
01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:56.810
<v Speaker 1>They have a commonality science really </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more effectively than religion.</v>

1328
01:00:56.811 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I would argue binds people globally </v>
<v Speaker 1>because religions are still an US versus</v>

1329
01:01:01.731 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>them thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Christian,</v>

1330
01:01:03.111 --> 01:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>you're a Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Christian or Islam or you know,</v>

1331
01:01:04.930 --> 01:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Buddhist.</v>

1332
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:10.940
<v Speaker 1>It's always us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus them was science in principle.</v>

1333
01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>It's anyone can do it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're all working towards a common </v>

1334
01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.911
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to understand how the universe </v>

1335
01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:18.911
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

1336
01:01:18.911 --> 01:01:19.060
<v Speaker 1>It we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not interested in,</v>

1337
01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pushing our own picture or joining </v>

1338
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.311
<v Speaker 1>together to believe anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing people think of </v>

1339
01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:27.311
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1340
01:01:27.311 --> 01:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists push evolution because we all</v>

1341
01:01:28.371 --> 01:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>get together and at night and with </v>
<v Speaker 1>special rings and talk to each other,</v>

1342
01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>say we don't want wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to believe anything else.</v>

1343
01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>They don't realize if you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientist,</v>

1344
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>the biggest way to become famous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what we all do when we go into work </v>

1345
01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.501
<v Speaker 1>every day is try and prove our </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues wrong because that's how you </v>

1346
01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>really make progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1347
01:01:44.781 --> 01:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>something we thought was right is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what we thought it was.</v>

1348
01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>Those are the great discoveries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>push people forward.</v>

1349
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's not as if we all buy into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

1350
01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>We're all trying to push knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

1351
01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>which means we're trying to discover </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps old biases and,</v>

1352
01:02:00.370 --> 01:02:01.400
<v Speaker 1>and overcome them.</v>

1353
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>And so scientists are bound together not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push their own.</v>

1354
01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we all have theories,</v>

1355
01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>but we're all willing to throw them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

1356
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the theories are proven wrong and </v>

1357
01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>we're all willing to celebrate being </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

1358
01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a wonderful thing.</v>

1359
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1360
01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:21.770
<v Speaker 1>as I always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a theoretical physicist to two</v>

1361
01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>favorite states to be enter either wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>or confused because that's great because</v>

1362
01:02:25.490 --> 01:02:27.160
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to learn something </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1363
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 1>and if we are more comfortable with not </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing,</v>

1364
01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:32.810
<v Speaker 1>which is the other aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that science for many people is,</v>

1365
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>is terrifying because if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're deeply believe you know the </v>

1366
01:02:37.850 --> 01:02:41.571
<v Speaker 1>answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you believe really believe there's a </v>

1367
01:02:41.571 --> 01:02:41.571
<v Speaker 1>god you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can put aside that uncertainty.</v>

1368
01:02:41.571 --> 01:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>And for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty is terrifying,</v>

1369
01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:49.040
<v Speaker 1>but be comfortable with not knowing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful and moreover I would argue is </v>

1370
01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:51.270
<v Speaker 1>better for teachers and for parents.</v>

1371
01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids ask you questions and you </v>

1372
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>really want to always give them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer whether you know it or not,</v>

1373
01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be much better to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1374
01:02:58.381 --> 01:03:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's figure out if anyone knows this.</v>

1375
01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Because then they participate in the joy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of discovery.</v>

1376
01:03:04.171 --> 01:03:05.970
<v Speaker 1>They're not told something by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

1377
01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And same with teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think we should be teaching </v>

1378
01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:14.211
<v Speaker 1>questions rather than answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be teaching kids how to </v>

1379
01:03:14.211 --> 01:03:14.310
<v Speaker 1>question and then how to search for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answers,</v>

1380
01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:16.550
<v Speaker 1>how to distinguish the wheat from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaff out,</v>

1381
01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:18.450
<v Speaker 1>how to distinguish the nonsense from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

1382
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:20.460
<v Speaker 1>especially in our society right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to,</v>

1383
01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:24.660
<v Speaker 1>we used to teach school is if it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a composite story of information,</v>

1384
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:28.950
<v Speaker 1>now we know why I have in my phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have more information than in school,</v>

1385
01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:30.450
<v Speaker 1>but also have more misinformation.</v>

1386
01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.510
<v Speaker 1>How do I tell the difference if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process and that's it.</v>

1387
01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what we need to teach in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The process of skeptical inquiry,</v>

1388
01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:39.690
<v Speaker 1>relying on evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking many sources,</v>

1389
01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>testing your ideas constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we teach.</v>

1390
01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Those are the tools kids need to to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively in the modern world with a,</v>

1391
01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>with an internet that's full of and and </v>
<v Speaker 1>with new sources which are equally full </v>

1392
01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:56.241
<v Speaker 1>of misinformation as well as information</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the biggest issues I think </v>

1393
01:03:56.241 --> 01:03:59.361
<v Speaker 1>that people are having with religion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 21st century is these areas where </v>

1394
01:03:59.361 --> 01:04:01.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to question and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explore that things hit.</v>

1395
01:04:01.381 --> 01:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>These walls were this is God's will and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the way it is.</v>

1396
01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:08.610
<v Speaker 1>And in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we say that is just code word for,</v>

1397
01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:11.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too confusing.</v>

1398
01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:13.830
<v Speaker 1>It's too complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>too terrifying to terrifying and,</v>

1399
01:04:13.890 --> 01:04:16.560
<v Speaker 1>and that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or people say,</v>

1400
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>and this amazes me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1401
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I get people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious people saying,</v>

1402
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.140
<v Speaker 1>you will never understand the origin </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1403
01:04:22.380 --> 01:04:26.400
<v Speaker 1>You'll never understand what love is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science will never ever explained love.</v>

1404
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Science will never ever explained x or </v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

1405
01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And then I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's incredibly pompous statement</v>

1406
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:35.940
<v Speaker 1>because if you say that science will </v>
<v Speaker 1>never explain this,</v>

1407
01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.750
<v Speaker 1>you must understand it because how do </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that will never explain it?</v>

1408
01:04:40.170 --> 01:04:42.990
<v Speaker 1>We never know what we won't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain until we try.</v>

1409
01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there are things about our </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe that will never understand,</v>

1410
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.740
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know until we try.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can never say upfront that science </v>

1411
01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>will never explain this or that because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't tried.</v>

1412
01:04:54.510 --> 01:04:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And in my experience as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

1413
01:04:57.780 --> 01:04:58.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1414
01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:03.650
<v Speaker 1>there could have been brick walls but </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched progressively those brick </v>

1415
01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:05.790
<v Speaker 1>walls crumble as we move around them or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we break them.</v>

1416
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And it is so exhilarating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's the greatest story </v>

1417
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:11.360
<v Speaker 1>ever told.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so exhilarating to see them knocked</v>

1418
01:05:11.361 --> 01:05:13.950
<v Speaker 1>down and things you thought we'd never </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

1419
01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Or I remember one of the forces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>

1420
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>a very prominent physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties or early 19 actually in </v>

1421
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:25.800
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>69 said it will be a hundred years </v>

1422
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:25.800
<v Speaker 1>before we discover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand this interaction.</v>

1423
01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Next year the theory came out and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>so wonderful to see how the story </v>

1424
01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:35.040
<v Speaker 1>surmounts the biases and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipation of individual scientists.</v>

1425
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the greatest story ever told so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

1426
01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.680
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's ridiculous about saying no one </v>

1427
01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.601
<v Speaker 3>will ever figure anything out is that </v>
<v Speaker 3>what we figured out over the last 200 </v>

1428
01:05:45.601 --> 01:05:49.291
<v Speaker 3>years is monumental.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then human language has only been </v>

1429
01:05:49.291 --> 01:05:49.940
<v Speaker 3>around for 40,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

1430
01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:52.660
<v Speaker 3>We live another 50,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1431
01:05:52.670 --> 01:05:53.680
<v Speaker 3>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

1432
01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:57.120
<v Speaker 1>As long as we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as we keep open inquiry.</v>

1433
01:05:57.180 --> 01:05:58.470
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1434
01:05:58.710 --> 01:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went through a few hundred years of </v>

1435
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.391
<v Speaker 1>the Middle Ages where the incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>inquiry based civil culture of the </v>

1436
01:06:07.471 --> 01:06:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Greeks was just forgotten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1437
01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greeks had determined the </v>

1438
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:15.400
<v Speaker 1>circumference of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that it was round,</v>

1439
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.001
<v Speaker 1>but what its circumference was by simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurements that were van not accepted </v>

1440
01:06:20.001 --> 01:06:21.600
<v Speaker 1>because of dogma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to,</v>

1441
01:06:21.601 --> 01:06:24.750
<v Speaker 1>if we want to progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to be aware of dogma.</v>

1442
01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 1>How did they figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumference of the earth?</v>

1443
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:31.621
<v Speaker 1>So it's really neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was an aerostar guess I </v>

1444
01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:31.621
<v Speaker 1>forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What year was the Greek.</v>

1445
01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Now it's amazing what he said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1446
01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:37.440
<v Speaker 1>so at a certain time of day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a certain time of the year,</v>

1447
01:06:37.590 --> 01:06:40.470
<v Speaker 1>the sun is directly overhead at 12 noon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1448
01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.880
<v Speaker 1>And in my.</v>

1449
01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell that by looking down a </v>

1450
01:06:47.030 --> 01:06:48.891
<v Speaker 1>deep well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see the reflection of the sun </v>

1451
01:06:48.891 --> 01:06:48.891
<v Speaker 1>exactly in that deep well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

1452
01:06:48.891 --> 01:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>So the race and the sun which are coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>down in the same direction towards the </v>

1453
01:06:53.330 --> 01:06:56.001
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere it comes down to the deep </v>

1454
01:06:56.001 --> 01:06:57.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a hundred miles away the well </v>

1455
01:06:57.951 --> 01:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>because the surface is curved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the well is pointing a little bit </v>

1456
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>different direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the sun's rays come at a slightly </v>

1457
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:05.640
<v Speaker 1>different angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this on this day I will measure that.</v>

1458
01:07:05.641 --> 01:07:09.630
<v Speaker 1>The Sun is directly overhead for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get my friend 100 miles away to</v>

1459
01:07:09.631 --> 01:07:12.420
<v Speaker 1>measure the angle of the sun relative to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the well,</v>

1460
01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:17.220
<v Speaker 1>and if you that tells you that the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>is curved and if you do the geometry,</v>

1461
01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:22.221
<v Speaker 1>you can work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the 100 miles of the earth's surface </v>

1462
01:07:22.221 --> 01:07:22.590
<v Speaker 1>causes the sun's rays to suddenly be at </v>
<v Speaker 1>that angle,</v>

1463
01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.600
<v Speaker 1>how curved the earth is and what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumference of the earth is.</v>

1464
01:07:25.601 --> 01:07:28.410
<v Speaker 1>It's plain geometry that in principle </v>
<v Speaker 1>any high school student could do,</v>

1465
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:30.580
<v Speaker 3>but when you say 100 miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

1466
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:32.560
<v Speaker 3>how are they communicating with this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred miles away.</v>

1467
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:34.750
<v Speaker 3>They're not immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the guy writes it down and then they</v>

1468
01:07:34.770 --> 01:07:39.770
<v Speaker 3>takes a horse and they come and compare </v>
<v Speaker 3>notes later and they use a Sundial to </v>

1469
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:42.931
<v Speaker 3>determine the time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Sun Sundial to determine the time </v>

1470
01:07:42.931 --> 01:07:45.451
<v Speaker 3>and and the 100 miles a minute away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would there be a deviation at all in a </v>

1471
01:07:45.451 --> 01:07:45.490
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a minute or two?</v>

1472
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Well that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yep.</v>

1473
01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.370
<v Speaker 3>But so to something accuracy you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1474
01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.290
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you get it wrong to some accuracy,</v>

1475
01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.740
<v Speaker 3>but they did pretty damn well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They came up with the circumference was </v>

1476
01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.020
<v Speaker 3>darn close to the circumference of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>earth,</v>

1477
01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:57.890
<v Speaker 3>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1478
01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:02.170
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing that they use these </v>
<v Speaker 3>techniques so they were just so confused</v>

1479
01:08:02.171 --> 01:08:07.171
<v Speaker 3>and so curious about it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just tried to figure out what it </v>

1480
01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:07.171
<v Speaker 3>has got to be a way to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1481
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:08.520
<v Speaker 3>and they didn't.</v>

1482
01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:13.740
<v Speaker 1>They weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't forced with the dogma that </v>

1483
01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:13.740
<v Speaker 1>the earth is flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you,</v>

1484
01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've told today you were dealing with </v>

1485
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:18.560
<v Speaker 1>people who are still</v>

1486
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.130
<v Speaker 3>forced with that dogma is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do you feel about that in 2017?</v>

1487
01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:22.190
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

1488
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:27.191
<v Speaker 3>nothing's surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that gravity is not real and </v>

1489
01:08:27.191 --> 01:08:27.191
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>

1490
01:08:27.191 --> 01:08:28.010
<v Speaker 3>the people who say gravity are real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have a great solution,</v>

1491
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:33.370
<v Speaker 3>but it's a building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Walk out the window of the 13th floor </v>

1492
01:08:33.370 --> 01:08:36.551
<v Speaker 3>and test your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the great thing is do it before you </v>

1493
01:08:36.551 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 3>reproduce,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a magnetism thing.</v>

1494
01:08:36.561 --> 01:08:40.060
<v Speaker 3>They believe it's electro magnetism or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that that suddenly people</v>

1495
01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:41.390
<v Speaker 3>down to the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1496
01:08:41.391 --> 01:08:44.210
<v Speaker 3>that's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think so perinatal magnet and look at it</v>

1497
01:08:44.211 --> 01:08:45.710
<v Speaker 3>as what happens as you're falling into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth?</v>

1498
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's even more hilarious is that they.</v>

1499
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we talked about this before the podcast </v>

1500
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.110
<v Speaker 3>started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Japanese weather satellite.</v>

1501
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:56.510
<v Speaker 3>That takes an image,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a full image of the earth.</v>

1502
01:08:56.570 --> 01:08:57.920
<v Speaker 3>What is the name of that satellite </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1503
01:08:57.921 --> 01:08:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Jamie?</v>

1504
01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:02.870
<v Speaker 3>It takes a full image of the earth from </v>
<v Speaker 3>22,000</v>

1505
01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:07.871
<v Speaker 3>miles ago away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People keep saying in this flat earth </v>

1506
01:09:07.871 --> 01:09:10.250
<v Speaker 3>theory thing that there's no images of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth in full at.</v>

1507
01:09:10.251 --> 01:09:11.840
<v Speaker 3>They're all composites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not true.</v>

1508
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:16.870
<v Speaker 3>It's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are images of the earth that are </v>

1509
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:17.710
<v Speaker 3>taken every 10 minutes by this one </v>
<v Speaker 3>satellite and they're high resolution.</v>

1510
01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.720
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can access them online anytime you </v>

1511
01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.271
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but people see those and they want to </v>

1512
01:09:25.271 --> 01:09:25.550
<v Speaker 3>think they're fake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet they believe there's an ice wall</v>

1513
01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:29.990
<v Speaker 3>around Antarctica that you crossover and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fall to the abyss.</v>

1514
01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:33.440
<v Speaker 3>Where's this photo of the ice wall it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>have they never?</v>

1515
01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:35.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how does someone fly from Japan?</v>

1516
01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:37.610
<v Speaker 3>They don't believe that people can fly </v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world.</v>

1517
01:09:37.611 --> 01:09:39.980
<v Speaker 3>I've done it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done and that they're all lying.</v>

1518
01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:43.580
<v Speaker 3>Here's no one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have they ever thought at time zones,</v>

1519
01:09:44.190 --> 01:09:47.480
<v Speaker 3>why are there times zones of the earth </v>
<v Speaker 3>says flat where there time zones,</v>

1520
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:52.510
<v Speaker 3>the only reason they're telling me they </v>
<v Speaker 3>should go from New York to La and see </v>

1521
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:52.510
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

1522
01:09:52.510 --> 01:09:54.020
<v Speaker 3>The time is different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they will know,</v>

1523
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:56.030
<v Speaker 3>but they probably think it's a human </v>
<v Speaker 3>invention,</v>

1524
01:09:56.390 --> 01:10:01.390
<v Speaker 3>but you know the sun is still shining in</v>
<v Speaker 3>la when it's gone down in New York and </v>

1525
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:03.860
<v Speaker 3>they can call their friends and check </v>
<v Speaker 3>and if the earth was flat,</v>

1526
01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:09.160
<v Speaker 3>that wouldn't be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only the case because the earth is </v>

1527
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:09.160
<v Speaker 3>curved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1528
01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160
<v Speaker 3>so those simple things should should </v>
<v Speaker 3>convince people,</v>

1529
01:10:10.161 --> 01:10:13.610
<v Speaker 3>but people are willing to throw out </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence if they have a belief.</v>

1530
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:18.910
<v Speaker 3>That's really from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what I said before is we have to </v>

1531
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:20.210
<v Speaker 3>realize the easiest person to fool is </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself.</v>

1532
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.430
<v Speaker 3>So if you're not willing to question </v>
<v Speaker 3>your beliefs,</v>

1533
01:10:22.431 --> 01:10:26.900
<v Speaker 3>especially those that you hold </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly cherished beliefs in,</v>

1534
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:29.390
<v Speaker 3>if you're not willing to question those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna.</v>

1535
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.190
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna ever grow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1536
01:10:31.191 --> 01:10:36.191
<v Speaker 3>well that's a good way to put a </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly cherish because I think a </v>

1537
01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:36.191
<v Speaker 3>lot of people do cherish these ideas.</v>

1538
01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:40.240
<v Speaker 3>Things like the earth being flat because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it gives them some sort of information </v>

1539
01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.991
<v Speaker 3>leg up on everybody I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something that people don't know what </v>

1540
01:10:43.991 --> 01:10:44.990
<v Speaker 3>makes them feel better about themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They may hate gays because it makes them</v>

1541
01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:48.750
<v Speaker 3>feel better about not being gay or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 3>they are gay,</v>

1542
01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.590
<v Speaker 3>but you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You always worry about that.</v>

1543
01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:53.840
<v Speaker 3>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we all,</v>

1544
01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:57.680
<v Speaker 3>that's what I mean about being believing</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 impossible things for breakfast.</v>

1545
01:10:57.681 --> 01:11:02.681
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to make fun of people </v>

1546
01:11:02.681 --> 01:11:02.930
<v Speaker 3>because we all do think of things to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make us feel better about ourselves.</v>

1547
01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:08.260
<v Speaker 3>It's part of being human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the psychological pitfalls and so we </v>

1548
01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:08.260
<v Speaker 3>should be aware of those and I have them</v>
<v Speaker 3>in.</v>

1549
01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.980
<v Speaker 3>You have them and I don't pretend I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>

1550
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:14.010
<v Speaker 3>What I do try and do is question them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we can all do that</v>

1551
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1552
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.900
<v Speaker 1>I understand why people are beliefs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain things.</v>

1553
01:11:18.901 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can be.</v>

1554
01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins tells me about an </v>

1555
01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:26.130
<v Speaker 1>astrophysicist he knows who during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

1556
01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:28.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies objects in the sky and,</v>

1557
01:11:28.831 --> 01:11:29.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1558
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:32.550
<v Speaker 1>and looks at at galaxies or stars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures that they're,</v>

1559
01:11:32.551 --> 01:11:34.710
<v Speaker 1>that they're 12 billion years old or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

1560
01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:40.010
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet he goes home at night and then </v>

1561
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.010
<v Speaker 1>it's an and is convinced that the earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is 6,000</v>

1562
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:42.510
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somehow we can really do both.</v>

1563
01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows a guy like,</v>

1564
01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:48.710
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people can and we're all capable of </v>

1565
01:11:48.710 --> 01:11:50.370
<v Speaker 1>believing in to mutually contradictory </v>
<v Speaker 1>things at the same time.</v>

1566
01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:55.640
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way we're built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how does this guy really measure </v>

1567
01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.631
<v Speaker 1>the cause of these planets?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow it doesn't affect his </v>

1568
01:11:59.631 --> 01:12:02.781
<v Speaker 1>fundamental beliefs and it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true because we can all believe </v>

1569
01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:03.870
<v Speaker 1>things that are wrong and so it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean they're stupid.</v>

1570
01:12:04.260 --> 01:12:09.260
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean because this guy is </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently a fairly accomplished </v>

1571
01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:09.260
<v Speaker 1>astrophysicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the psychological pitfalls,</v>

1572
01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.730
<v Speaker 1>but we all have trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1573
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:12.480
<v Speaker 1>so many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1574
01:12:12.481 --> 01:12:17.481
<v Speaker 1>when I talk about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to seem pompous in the </v>

1575
01:12:17.481 --> 01:12:17.481
<v Speaker 1>sense of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1576
01:12:17.481 --> 01:12:20.901
<v Speaker 1>I'm better or scientists are better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science is better because science helps </v>

1577
01:12:20.901 --> 01:12:24.300
<v Speaker 1>us overcome those pitfalls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do those pitfalls exists though?</v>

1578
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:29.550
<v Speaker 1>Because because obviously evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that they have lived in </v>

1579
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:32.450
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary purpose that somehow they </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow.</v>

1580
01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:34.260
<v Speaker 1>If they didn't have an evolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

1581
01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:35.940
<v Speaker 1>then they wouldn't have been selected </v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

1582
01:12:35.970 --> 01:12:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1583
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:41.960
<v Speaker 1>There does seem to be some weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>inclination or some desire to expose </v>

1584
01:12:42.001 --> 01:12:44.760
<v Speaker 1>secrets to find secrets and did know </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1585
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nice.</v>

1586
01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other end,</v>

1587
01:12:47.550 --> 01:12:49.440
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's exploit that.</v>

1588
01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Discovering secrets is about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovering mysteries.</v>

1589
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Discovering mysteries is what motivates </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do is to do sign,</v>

1590
01:12:56.921 --> 01:12:58.140
<v Speaker 1>so let's put it in a positive light.</v>

1591
01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:03.440
<v Speaker 1>We all want to solve puzzles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all want to understand something and </v>

1592
01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:06.180
<v Speaker 1>maybe the first one to understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all want to access information may be</v>

1593
01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.360
<v Speaker 1>and make us feel special for doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

1594
01:13:08.370 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 1>that's the reason I do science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1595
01:13:09.691 --> 01:13:12.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not save the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because I really wanted to know,</v>

1596
01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1597
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:15.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's nice to be the first person to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe understand stuff.</v>

1598
01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:20.560
<v Speaker 1>It's gratifying for your ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a and we are driven by ego and,</v>

1599
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:22.910
<v Speaker 1>and let's not pretend otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

1600
01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:28.000
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're talking about measurable </v>

1601
01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.130
<v Speaker 1>things and elements and things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could sort of expose and explain,</v>

1602
01:13:29.131 --> 01:13:34.131
<v Speaker 1>but what these people seem to be really </v>
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with is people lying about </v>

1603
01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:38.740
<v Speaker 1>stuff and covering up secrets about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth being flat or chem trails.</v>

1604
01:13:38.741 --> 01:13:43.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd like to believe there's a </v>

1605
01:13:43.741 --> 01:13:43.741
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy's are very,</v>

1606
01:13:43.741 --> 01:13:43.860
<v Speaker 1>very attractive.</v>

1607
01:13:43.890 --> 01:13:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it.</v>

1608
01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1609
01:13:45.910 --> 01:13:46.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

1610
01:13:46.501 --> 01:13:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a psychologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what I say here is just speculation,</v>

1611
01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:55.700
<v Speaker 1>but the world doesn't care what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe and it doesn't treat you fairly.</v>

1612
01:13:56.410 --> 01:13:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1613
01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world,</v>

1614
01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:00.840
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't treat me fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't treat you fairly.</v>

1615
01:14:00.841 --> 01:14:03.220
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't give a damn if it's my </v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing or,</v>

1616
01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

1617
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm being treated unfairly.</v>

1618
01:14:07.981 --> 01:14:12.981
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it better for me to think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone is actively being unfair to me </v>

1619
01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:13.420
<v Speaker 1>than just assume it's just the way it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is?</v>

1620
01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Because then I can blame it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I tend to think conspiracy </v>

1621
01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.360
<v Speaker 1>theorists tend to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1622
01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.760
<v Speaker 1>the things I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real reason for it.</v>

1623
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:24.820
<v Speaker 1>It's not an accident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just haphazard,</v>

1624
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:27.250
<v Speaker 1>it's not anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in and it,</v>

1625
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:27.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1626
01:14:27.970 --> 01:14:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I've lost my job because there's gotta </v>
<v Speaker 1>be a reason.</v>

1627
01:14:30.911 --> 01:14:35.911
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be a villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be someone making it </v>

1628
01:14:35.911 --> 01:14:36.580
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like the reason we burned witches.</v>

1629
01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:42.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there were storms or there </v>

1630
01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:42.090
<v Speaker 1>wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't crops that year.</v>

1631
01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people say it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting historical theory,</v>

1632
01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.040
<v Speaker 1>which I think is seems quite plausible </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that when Newton discovered the </v>

1633
01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:50.560
<v Speaker 1>laws of gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universal law of gravity,</v>

1634
01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:54.190
<v Speaker 1>it contributed to the ending of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>burning of witches.</v>

1635
01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:56.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that that was a,</v>

1636
01:14:56.011 --> 01:14:58.320
<v Speaker 2>meant the burning of witches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought they drowned them mostly.</v>

1637
01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

1638
01:14:58.890 --> 01:15:01.000
<v Speaker 1>had they hung a lot of them too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drown them.</v>

1639
01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:02.170
<v Speaker 1>Where do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care whether it's burning.</v>

1640
01:15:02.171 --> 01:15:03.160
<v Speaker 1>They killed her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>

1641
01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:04.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They blamed crops.</v>

1642
01:15:04.991 --> 01:15:09.991
<v Speaker 1>They blamed the bad things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when Newton discovered that </v>

1643
01:15:09.991 --> 01:15:11.920
<v Speaker 1>even the planets are affected by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same laws that Annapolis,</v>

1644
01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:17.070
<v Speaker 1>there's a universal laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It meant that physical effects had </v>

1645
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.830
<v Speaker 1>physical causes and when bad things </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

1646
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:22.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a physical reason there's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone you can blame and and witches or</v>

1647
01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:27.601
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of arguments that </v>

1648
01:15:27.601 --> 01:15:30.151
<v Speaker 1>suggests that that kind of development </v>
<v Speaker 1>and physics led to the end of blaming </v>

1649
01:15:30.151 --> 01:15:33.460
<v Speaker 1>people for those for bad crops or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or for bad things happening.</v>

1650
01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:35.660
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's the kind of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we.</v>

1651
01:15:35.661 --> 01:15:40.661
<v Speaker 1>We want to find someone to blame rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>than just saying the universe doesn't </v>

1652
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:40.661
<v Speaker 1>give a shit</v>

1653
01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:43.780
<v Speaker 2>about me and anybody interested in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is a really fascinating subject.</v>

1654
01:15:43.781 --> 01:15:48.781
<v Speaker 2>But the whole Salem witch trial thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there's a lot of really convincing </v>

1655
01:15:48.781 --> 01:15:50.620
<v Speaker 2>evidence that seems to point towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>ergot poisoning.</v>

1656
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:56.010
<v Speaker 2>That there was some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a late freeze and that this particular </v>

1657
01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:59.020
<v Speaker 2>type of fungus grew on some of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>wheat that makes Origami,</v>

1658
01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:02.080
<v Speaker 2>which is a very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has very lsd like properties.</v>

1659
01:16:02.081 --> 01:16:07.081
<v Speaker 2>And they think these people thought they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were being bewitched because they're </v>

1660
01:16:07.081 --> 01:16:07.081
<v Speaker 2>being contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1661
01:16:07.081 --> 01:16:08.560
<v Speaker 2>it's a great idea if the evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1662
01:16:08.561 --> 01:16:10.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it is fascinating,</v>

1663
01:16:10.311 --> 01:16:11.110
<v Speaker 2>but let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's,</v>

1664
01:16:11.330 --> 01:16:14.650
<v Speaker 1>can we all I think behind that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

1665
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:16.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've all had.</v>

1666
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're seeing are extremes </v>

1667
01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.501
<v Speaker 1>of characteristics that we all have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think many of us assign blame when we </v>

1668
01:16:26.471 --> 01:16:28.150
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I lose my keys,</v>

1669
01:16:28.151 --> 01:16:29.770
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I see them out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you put the,</v>

1670
01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.600
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did you put the keys?</v>

1671
01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I learned very quickly that I </v>

1672
01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:38.551
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it's just an,</v>

1673
01:16:39.940 --> 01:16:44.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a characteristic of being human and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting it as a characteristic of </v>

1674
01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:45.850
<v Speaker 1>being human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't diminish us,</v>

1675
01:16:46.690 --> 01:16:50.420
<v Speaker 1>but what's really great is we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that and try and work and,</v>

1676
01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:52.280
<v Speaker 1>and try and figure out ways to avoid</v>

1677
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:55.280
<v Speaker 2>those pitfalls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of these ways of thinking,</v>

1678
01:16:55.281 --> 01:17:00.281
<v Speaker 2>these patterns of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are sort of hold offs from the </v>

1679
01:17:00.281 --> 01:17:03.940
<v Speaker 2>ancient days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the things that helped us to </v>

1680
01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:03.940
<v Speaker 2>survive those pathways now are </v>
<v Speaker 2>counterproductive.</v>

1681
01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I ran a meeting at my origins </v>

1682
01:17:08.640 --> 01:17:11.511
<v Speaker 1>project is about the origins of </v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobia and w and w no US versus </v>

1683
01:17:11.511 --> 01:17:15.971
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out there's really useful </v>

1684
01:17:15.971 --> 01:17:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Zena evolutionary purposes for us versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>them tribal purposes and not just that </v>

1685
01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:24.190
<v Speaker 1>actually it goes back to biochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immune systems is us versus them just </v>

1686
01:17:24.190 --> 01:17:25.900
<v Speaker 1>being able to recognize foreign bodies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cells.</v>

1687
01:17:25.901 --> 01:17:28.160
<v Speaker 1>So it goes back to single cell </v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms,</v>

1688
01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:31.530
<v Speaker 1>but then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it now got to uh,</v>

1689
01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:32.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

1690
01:17:32.511 --> 01:17:35.440
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it now run its course and become on,</v>

1691
01:17:35.441 --> 01:17:36.790
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be counterproductive.</v>

1692
01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we have to look at those things</v>

1693
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:41.630
<v Speaker 1>and ask what their is and if we explore </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

1694
01:17:41.631 --> 01:17:46.631
<v Speaker 1>then then there's a better chance that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can deal with them and asked what's </v>

1695
01:17:46.631 --> 01:17:51.011
<v Speaker 1>useful and what isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we refuse to acknowledge that </v>

1696
01:17:51.011 --> 01:17:53.951
<v Speaker 1>those things exist and that they may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of our religion or our </v>

1697
01:17:53.951 --> 01:17:56.090
<v Speaker 1>beliefs or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we're,</v>

1698
01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.190
<v Speaker 1>then we can't possibly overcome them.</v>

1699
01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Or You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to change gears a little bit.</v>

1700
01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:05.060
<v Speaker 1>Are you concerned at all about ai?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1701
01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:05.870
<v Speaker 1>we will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1702
01:18:05.871 --> 01:18:10.871
<v Speaker 1>We just had a workshop again at my </v>
<v Speaker 1>origins project in which you can watch </v>

1703
01:18:10.871 --> 01:18:10.871
<v Speaker 1>it online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public event anyway.</v>

1704
01:18:10.871 --> 01:18:11.520
<v Speaker 1>Where can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said,</v>

1705
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dot origins dot Asu Dot Edu.</v>

1706
01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.330
<v Speaker 1>We run these amazing events and what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>neat to me by the way,</v>

1707
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:20.000
<v Speaker 1>is we get 3000 people attending the pain</v>
<v Speaker 1>to attend.</v>

1708
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:23.690
<v Speaker 1>People really want to hear science if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done right and interestingly.</v>

1709
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.590
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1710
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:25.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

1711
01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:29.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm so pleased and privileged that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people find things that interesting</v>

1712
01:18:29.781 --> 01:18:33.590
<v Speaker 1>and come over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so we ran this,</v>

1713
01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:37.330
<v Speaker 1>this event called the future of ai who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>in control because associated with.</v>

1714
01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:42.360
<v Speaker 1>We had a scientific workshop on what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the possible disruptive influences of </v>

1715
01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Ai is gonna change the world.</v>

1716
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:49.090
<v Speaker 1>It's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The future is not going to be like the </v>

1717
01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:51.461
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it means to be human is not going </v>

1718
01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:51.461
<v Speaker 1>to be like it was the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get over it.</v>

1719
01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is some of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we think are horrible,</v>

1720
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:57.170
<v Speaker 1>may not be so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1721
01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:02.470
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Greeks thought the </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction of writing would be </v>

1722
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:04.130
<v Speaker 1>horrible because oral storytelling would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be destroyed,</v>

1723
01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:07.730
<v Speaker 1>but writing wasn't such a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually made the world kind of maybe</v>

1724
01:19:07.731 --> 01:19:10.610
<v Speaker 1>a more interesting place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It maybe,</v>

1725
01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:15.670
<v Speaker 1>maybe ai will take over certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>functions that humans have teaching or </v>

1726
01:19:15.670 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 1>doctoring or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it won't be so bad.</v>

1727
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it maybe it seems terrifying for </v>

1728
01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:23.800
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe won't be so bad.</v>

1729
01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.090
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine awful consequences,</v>

1730
01:19:26.091 --> 01:19:28.090
<v Speaker 1>ones that are already bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we.</v>

1731
01:19:28.110 --> 01:19:33.110
<v Speaker 1>We looked at these disruptive possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences and the point is it can </v>

1732
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.110
<v Speaker 1>have both.</v>

1733
01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.770
<v Speaker 1>What's really important is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you think about it,</v>

1734
01:19:38.290 --> 01:19:41.960
<v Speaker 1>pasture said fortune favors the prepared</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind ultimately.</v>

1735
01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:45.860
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ai is both terrifying and exciting.</v>

1736
01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:49.700
<v Speaker 1>The future is terrifying and exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1737
01:19:49.701 --> 01:19:54.701
<v Speaker 1>I'm really excited by the possibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that ai might become better physicists </v>

1738
01:19:56.091 --> 01:19:57.290
<v Speaker 1>in us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'd like to know.</v>

1739
01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:59.450
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to know how intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

1740
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:02.600
<v Speaker 1>especially intelligent quantum computers</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand quantum mechanics.</v>

1741
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:05.810
<v Speaker 1>They may understand it better than we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I might learn from them.</v>

1742
01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.120
<v Speaker 1>So maybe there'll be the dominant </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists in the future of the dominant</v>

1743
01:20:09.121 --> 01:20:13.620
<v Speaker 1>academics and we can learn from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can learn from intelligent artificial</v>

1744
01:20:13.621 --> 01:20:17.130
<v Speaker 1>systems that wouldn't be so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it seems like it'd be bad,</v>

1745
01:20:17.131 --> 01:20:22.131
<v Speaker 1>but what's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really rose colored glasses though </v>

1746
01:20:22.131 --> 01:20:22.131
<v Speaker 1>what that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be.</v>

1747
01:20:22.131 --> 01:20:24.740
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be that,</v>

1748
01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.170
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1749
01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:29.370
<v Speaker 1>that intelligent is ai decides that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no need.</v>

1750
01:20:29.770 --> 01:20:31.200
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's something that,</v>

1751
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:34.710
<v Speaker 1>that one of the people who was at our </v>
<v Speaker 1>workshop and Yon Tallen who,</v>

1752
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.920
<v Speaker 1>who founded skype was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinators of our workshop and he </v>

1753
01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:39.920
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1754
01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen is really bad for,</v>

1755
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:43.190
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1756
01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:44.730
<v Speaker 1>oxidation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1757
01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:45.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1758
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:47.310
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic systems.</v>

1759
01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if ai could control,</v>

1760
01:20:50.821 --> 01:20:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a technology,</v>

1761
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.880
<v Speaker 1>they might want to systematically reduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oxygen content of the atmosphere,</v>

1762
01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't be so good for humanity.</v>

1763
01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can imagine the other extreme </v>

1764
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:06.861
<v Speaker 1>where basically intelligent ai systems </v>
<v Speaker 1>control most of the technology in the </v>

1765
01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:08.550
<v Speaker 1>world and maneuver things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So humans become extinct.</v>

1766
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.460
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine one realm or the other,</v>

1767
01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.760
<v Speaker 1>but unless you think about the ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can try and and ensure that the </v>

1768
01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:23.241
<v Speaker 1>future is as good as can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to at least confront those </v>

1769
01:21:23.241 --> 01:21:23.241
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

1770
01:21:23.241 --> 01:21:24.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't put your head in the sand and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't go,</v>

1771
01:21:24.961 --> 01:21:26.220
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is ending.</v>

1772
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:27.360
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1773
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.250
<v Speaker 1>this is going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are changes are going to happen.</v>

1774
01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:34.251
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ai will displace millions of people from</v>

1775
01:21:35.101 --> 01:21:36.390
<v Speaker 1>their work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1776
01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:36.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1777
01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:38.880
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt if not billions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if billions.</v>

1778
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Let's say billions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

1779
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:42.330
<v Speaker 1>what's that going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1780
01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:47.331
<v Speaker 1>there are two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two possibilities and one of </v>

1781
01:21:47.331 --> 01:21:48.981
<v Speaker 1>them was imagined by John Maynard Keynes</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he thought about what </v>

1782
01:21:48.981 --> 01:21:48.981
<v Speaker 1>industrialization would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

1783
01:21:48.981 --> 01:21:53.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects of it is that machines are </v>

1784
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.570
<v Speaker 1>going to do a lot of the work that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to do.</v>

1785
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:54.750
<v Speaker 1>But the great thing is that'll free </v>
<v Speaker 1>people from the work.</v>

1786
01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:56.790
<v Speaker 1>There'll be able to go have coffee and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee shops,</v>

1787
01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:59.730
<v Speaker 1>go see read books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know see plays.</v>

1788
01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:01.770
<v Speaker 1>The quality of their life will improve.</v>

1789
01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:04.550
<v Speaker 1>But of course that didn't happen because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1790
01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:09.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the increased resources that were </v>

1791
01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:09.560
<v Speaker 1>decreased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased money and,</v>

1792
01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:09.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1793
01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:11.910
<v Speaker 1>and all of that that was generated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrialization wasn't,</v>

1794
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:16.740
<v Speaker 1>wasn't uniformly distributed at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point when we are billions of people out</v>

1795
01:22:16.741 --> 01:22:17.940
<v Speaker 1>of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to decide to say,</v>

1796
01:22:17.941 --> 01:22:18.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1797
01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:24.080
<v Speaker 1>those machines that produced a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>net quality potential quality of life </v>

1798
01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.010
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we have to spread the wealth,</v>

1799
01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.210
<v Speaker 1>maybe some sort of universal basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>

1800
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:33.320
<v Speaker 1>And I think frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a choice either we as machines </v>

1801
01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:37.101
<v Speaker 1>begin to do just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a choice to move in that </v>

1802
01:22:37.101 --> 01:22:37.101
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me.</v>

1803
01:22:37.101 --> 01:22:40.470
<v Speaker 1>Or we have a choice to move in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction of incredible socio economic,</v>

1804
01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:43.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and Tom Moulton and,</v>

1805
01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to create huge,</v>

1806
01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:49.950
<v Speaker 1>huge societal problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm worried that in our society,</v>

1807
01:22:49.951 --> 01:22:54.951
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't even want to provide </v>

1808
01:22:54.951 --> 01:22:56.160
<v Speaker 1>healthcare to everyone where some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1809
01:22:56.161 --> 01:22:58.140
<v Speaker 1>why should I pay for you when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>sick?</v>

1810
01:22:59.010 --> 01:23:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Even though we live in a society that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy enough to do just that,</v>

1811
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:04.320
<v Speaker 1>that will never get to a point where we </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

1812
01:23:04.321 --> 01:23:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these machines have generated incredible</v>

1813
01:23:07.511 --> 01:23:12.511
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's allow all the people who've been </v>

1814
01:23:12.511 --> 01:23:13.090
<v Speaker 1>displaced to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to benefit from that wealth.</v>

1815
01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that won't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

1816
01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:15.490
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1817
01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pessimistic about the future.</v>

1818
01:23:17.801 --> 01:23:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise my friend Cormac McCarthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

1819
01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.710
<v Speaker 1>because he's a really chipper fellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he writes very dark books and when I</v>

1820
01:23:23.711 --> 01:23:26.300
<v Speaker 1>first met him I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you be so cheerful?</v>

1821
01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:26.890
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1822
01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:32.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pessimist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's no reason to be gloomy and </v>

1823
01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:35.020
<v Speaker 1>that's become my mantra ever since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great statement.</v>

1824
01:23:35.021 --> 01:23:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

1825
01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm worried about with ai is that </v>

1826
01:23:41.010 --> 01:23:41.440
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at it as if it's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>invention.</v>

1827
01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a human invention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which most certainly is,</v>

1828
01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:46.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a life form.</v>

1829
01:23:46.690 --> 01:23:48.580
<v Speaker 1>What I'm worried about is that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>decides,</v>

1830
01:23:48.581 --> 01:23:49.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>

1831
01:23:49.481 --> 01:23:51.220
<v Speaker 1>if you extrapolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1832
01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so big deal.</v>

1833
01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Well that it decides to make a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>version of itself.</v>

1834
01:23:55.991 --> 01:23:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Then it continues to do that and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be completely obsolete within a</v>

1835
01:23:58.841 --> 01:23:59.820
<v Speaker 1>shorter amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

1836
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1837
01:24:01.061 --> 01:24:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean no law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's could be good or bad.</v>

1838
01:24:02.861 --> 01:24:07.861
<v Speaker 1>So it's to this note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is your illusion that you're </v>

1839
01:24:07.861 --> 01:24:07.890
<v Speaker 1>significant with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1840
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1841
01:24:09.111 --> 01:24:11.860
<v Speaker 1>It just stay alive long enough to die of</v>
<v Speaker 1>old age,</v>

1842
01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.760
<v Speaker 1>but maybe eaten by robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of things that,</v>

1843
01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.920
<v Speaker 1>that don't have any real purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what would the robots,</v>

1844
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go with robots,</v>

1845
01:24:20.230 --> 01:24:25.230
<v Speaker 1>would it be and why would they feel it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary to destroy us?</v>

1846
01:24:26.860 --> 01:24:28.510
<v Speaker 1>Because we're polluting the environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>we made.</v>

1847
01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:29.860
<v Speaker 1>We made your world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1848
01:24:29.861 --> 01:24:31.750
<v Speaker 1>not when we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're not governing things.</v>

1849
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:33.100
<v Speaker 1>We might not be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1850
01:24:33.130 --> 01:24:36.020
<v Speaker 1>we might want to say they might want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>save us like we do the turtles and,</v>

1851
01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:41.710
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in various places they don't want the </v>

1852
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:41.710
<v Speaker 1>lights to happen because the turtles </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

1853
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:41.710
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1854
01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:46.050
<v Speaker 1>mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the lights are on the beach and we </v>

1855
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:46.050
<v Speaker 1>don't do such a good job of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

1856
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:46.050
<v Speaker 1>but there'll be better than us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1857
01:24:46.050 --> 01:24:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we might be an evil hyena like </v>

1858
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:50.910
<v Speaker 1>species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we are,</v>

1859
01:24:50.910 --> 01:24:52.210
<v Speaker 1>then why should we be around?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>

1860
01:24:52.211 --> 01:24:54.220
<v Speaker 1>But I mean I'm worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no,</v>

1861
01:24:54.221 --> 01:24:56.260
<v Speaker 1>but maybe give us a chance to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

1862
01:24:56.261 --> 01:25:00.820
<v Speaker 1>but maybe you could view them as your </v>
<v Speaker 1>offspring and then you then,</v>

1863
01:25:02.190 --> 01:25:03.700
<v Speaker 1>then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at my offspring.</v>

1864
01:25:03.730 --> 01:25:06.460
<v Speaker 1>And in fact actually I do think </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately if,</v>

1865
01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:07.310
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

1866
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:12.450
<v Speaker 1>if machines can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can program themselves and ultimately </v>

1867
01:25:12.450 --> 01:25:13.510
<v Speaker 1>come better than it will be difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>for biology to keep up.</v>

1868
01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.720
<v Speaker 1>And our future is humans will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could easily be what you would call the </v>

1869
01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:22.981
<v Speaker 1>Borg in Star Trek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could easily say the only sensible ways </v>

1870
01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:22.981
<v Speaker 1>to merge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1871
01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:22.981
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1872
01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:23.530
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really interesting.</v>

1873
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:26.140
<v Speaker 1>So then the dominant life form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be really interesting.</v>

1874
01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:31.410
<v Speaker 1>So we tend to think of why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are carbon based individuals that </v>

1875
01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:34.590
<v Speaker 1>dominant life form in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it could be if we're looking at the </v>

1876
01:25:34.590 --> 01:25:36.280
<v Speaker 1>out in the universe of looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominant life form their silicon based,</v>

1877
01:25:36.490 --> 01:25:38.320
<v Speaker 1>they're not carbon based and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1878
01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:39.230
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1879
01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:44.250
<v Speaker 1>and it'd really be interesting because </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case it would be intelligent </v>

1880
01:25:44.250 --> 01:25:47.431
<v Speaker 1>design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine a bunch of intelligent </v>

1881
01:25:47.431 --> 01:25:47.740
<v Speaker 1>computers having a podcast in the far </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

1882
01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:48.800
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1883
01:25:49.150 --> 01:25:54.150
<v Speaker 1>I think we were designed by these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by these monkeys and they would be </v>

1884
01:25:55.721 --> 01:25:56.280
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1885
01:25:56.330 --> 01:26:00.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what's really fascinating is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that we are some sort of a,</v>

1886
01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:04.490
<v Speaker 1>not just a creator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that we're the predecessors</v>

1887
01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:05.930
<v Speaker 2>of some greater species</v>

1888
01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:08.580
<v Speaker 1>and who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows who knows what the is going to</v>

1889
01:26:08.581 --> 01:26:09.220
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

1890
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but to be afraid of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inevitable.</v>

1891
01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately what can happen will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will happen.</v>

1892
01:26:16.331 --> 01:26:18.510
<v Speaker 1>We just have to accept that and we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and,</v>

1893
01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and prepare for it as best as possible </v>

1894
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:24.490
<v Speaker 1>to try to make sure it works out as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

1895
01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I begin this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest story ever told so far with</v>

1896
01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:29.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a quote from,</v>

1897
01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:31.720
<v Speaker 1>from Virgil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the idea saying the.</v>

1898
01:26:31.721 --> 01:26:33.560
<v Speaker 1>I think these are the tiers of things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1899
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 1>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1900
01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:36.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you have a copy of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>book around.</v>

1901
01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.390
<v Speaker 1>I was going to bring my name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure you'd have with you anyway,</v>

1902
01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.410
<v Speaker 1>and the stuff of our mortality costs us </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the heart.</v>

1903
01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:48.700
<v Speaker 1>That's a Latin phrase that people </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that famous,</v>

1904
01:26:48.701 --> 01:26:50.300
<v Speaker 1>but the next phrase in the night and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

1905
01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.010
<v Speaker 1>which I talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very last page or two of the book is</v>

1906
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:58.150
<v Speaker 1>this phase release your fear and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the important thing,</v>

1907
01:26:58.330 --> 01:27:00.580
<v Speaker 1>that stuff overall mortality does cause </v>
<v Speaker 1>us to the heart,</v>

1908
01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:05.940
<v Speaker 1>but release your fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use it to make our brief moment in the </v>

1909
01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:05.940
<v Speaker 1>sun more precious,</v>

1910
01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:10.830
<v Speaker 2>but it's fascinating to me that we're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected to this particular form that </v>

1911
01:27:10.830 --> 01:27:12.060
<v Speaker 2>we find ourselves in now and that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

1912
01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:15.940
<v Speaker 2>We're so attached to it and that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>though we know that we are a finite life</v>

1913
01:27:15.941 --> 01:27:17.770
<v Speaker 2>form as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't.</v>

1914
01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:20.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go on what I'm saying irrationally,</v>

1915
01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.450
<v Speaker 2>but we know that we're a finite life </v>
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>

1916
01:27:22.451 --> 01:27:26.620
<v Speaker 2>We would like to think that we stay in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this state for as long as</v>

1917
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:29.750
<v Speaker 1>history and we would like to wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1918
01:27:29.751 --> 01:27:31.940
<v Speaker 1>but of course we're just temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've run as humans,</v>

1919
01:27:31.941 --> 01:27:34.850
<v Speaker 1>even that's almonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homo sapiens have only been around for a</v>

1920
01:27:34.851 --> 01:27:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Spec of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple hundred thousand years.</v>

1921
01:27:36.771 --> 01:27:41.771
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who would expect our future to be </v>

1922
01:27:41.771 --> 01:27:41.771
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1923
01:27:41.771 --> 01:27:41.771
<v Speaker 1>of course it can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1924
01:27:41.771 --> 01:27:43.040
<v Speaker 1>and what if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if,</v>

1925
01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:49.720
<v Speaker 1>what if?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The things that are wonderful about our </v>

1926
01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:49.720
<v Speaker 1>culture are preserved by our </v>
<v Speaker 1>descendants,</v>

1927
01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:52.220
<v Speaker 1>but our descendants aren't carbon based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1928
01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.590
<v Speaker 1>So what's wrong with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you,</v>

1929
01:27:54.591 --> 01:27:56.300
<v Speaker 1>why do you care if your great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

1930
01:27:56.301 --> 01:27:56.750
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

1931
01:27:56.751 --> 01:27:57.200
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

1932
01:27:57.201 --> 01:27:57.620
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

1933
01:27:57.621 --> 01:27:59.810
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great grandchildren look like you,</v>

1934
01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1935
01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.520
<v Speaker 1>of course we all do because we want </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody mortality.</v>

1936
01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.370
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1937
01:28:04.371 --> 01:28:06.170
<v Speaker 1>So the robots are made to look like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1938
01:28:06.171 --> 01:28:06.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1939
01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:12.140
<v Speaker 1>they all have Joe Rogan faces on them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of them or did you see x Makena?</v>

1940
01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:17.890
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've talked to Alex Garland who was </v>

1942
01:28:17.890 --> 01:28:18.940
<v Speaker 1>a hesitation there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a little nod and you know,</v>

1943
01:28:19.090 --> 01:28:20.450
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

1944
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:25.510
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course whenever I see science </v>

1945
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.510
<v Speaker 1>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1946
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.620
<v Speaker 1>I try to suspend disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1947
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:27.860
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

1948
01:28:27.861 --> 01:28:31.550
<v Speaker 1>I showed a clip from smacna in our event</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

1949
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:36.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think there are many possible </v>

1950
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.790
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

1951
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:40.130
<v Speaker 1>of artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is malevolence,</v>

1952
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:43.100
<v Speaker 1>but the other is unintended negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

1953
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And I thought Max Malkin it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a wonderful example of unintended</v>

1954
01:28:47.631 --> 01:28:49.730
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

1955
01:28:49.731 --> 01:28:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that lovely young woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>was designed to be evil,</v>

1956
01:28:54.110 --> 01:28:59.110
<v Speaker 1>but it was an unintended consequence </v>
<v Speaker 1>when she saw an opportunity for herself </v>

1957
01:28:59.110 --> 01:29:01.010
<v Speaker 1>and the other one I showed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's from 2001 a space.</v>

1958
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.390
<v Speaker 1>The great how warehouses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry Dave,</v>

1959
01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>

1960
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:05.340
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1961
01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:07.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

1962
01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:12.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wonderful and thoughtful </v>

1963
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:12.300
<v Speaker 1>and it was thought provoking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

1964
01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:12.510
<v Speaker 1>and as I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've come to know Alex Garland who wrote</v>

1965
01:29:12.511 --> 01:29:15.540
<v Speaker 1>it and directed as innocent and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a very thoughtful,</v>

1966
01:29:15.541 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 1>interesting guy and one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>all time movies.</v>

1967
01:29:17.611 --> 01:29:18.190
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1968
01:29:18.210 --> 01:29:19.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a really interesting movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1969
01:29:20.190 --> 01:29:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>

1970
01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I always try and analyze it afterwards </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes as a scientist I,</v>

1971
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:26.550
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1972
01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I try not to get in the way of liking </v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction because of course they </v>

1973
01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:34.800
<v Speaker 1>all involve suspending disbelief and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain things in.</v>

1974
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:39.980
<v Speaker 1>And the difference between good science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction and bad science fiction is not </v>

1975
01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:43.340
<v Speaker 1>how scientifically accurate it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how good a story it is because if </v>

1976
01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a good story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can suspend disbelief easily.</v>

1977
01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone was asking me the other day on </v>

1978
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.341
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a science fiction podcast where it </v>

1979
01:29:51.341 --> 01:29:51.341
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1980
01:29:51.341 --> 01:29:51.700
<v Speaker 1>what's the worst example of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1981
01:29:51.710 --> 01:29:53.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the example that comes to mind is,</v>

1982
01:29:53.611 --> 01:29:58.611
<v Speaker 1>I remember in New York Times reporter </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the physics of Star Trek came out </v>

1983
01:29:58.611 --> 01:30:02.820
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I go with you to a science fiction </v>

1984
01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:02.820
<v Speaker 1>movie and watch you and then talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it?</v>

1985
01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:06.750
<v Speaker 1>And so we went to see a starship </v>
<v Speaker 1>troopers and this is the stupidest movie</v>

1986
01:30:06.751 --> 01:30:08.670
<v Speaker 1>of all time because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1987
01:30:08.671 --> 01:30:09.630
<v Speaker 1>because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1988
01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:11.100
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

1989
01:30:11.101 --> 01:30:14.490
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ants poop out things at supersonic</v>

1990
01:30:14.491 --> 01:30:16.560
<v Speaker 1>speeds about cross the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1991
01:30:16.561 --> 01:30:17.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing,</v>

1992
01:30:17.491 --> 01:30:18.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's stupid.</v>

1993
01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.660
<v Speaker 1>What's a very campy movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1994
01:30:21.661 --> 01:30:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

1995
01:30:22.021 --> 01:30:27.021
<v Speaker 1>but when the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was asking me to look at the </v>

1996
01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:30.231
<v Speaker 1>reality of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't even suspend disbelief if I </v>

1997
01:30:30.231 --> 01:30:30.231
<v Speaker 1>want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that.</v>

1998
01:30:30.231 --> 01:30:30.690
<v Speaker 1>But it's things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

1999
01:30:32.190 --> 01:30:37.190
<v Speaker 1>when something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's suddenly takes you out of the </v>

2000
01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:37.190
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You suddenly go,</v>

2001
01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:37.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's another one,</v>

2002
01:30:37.390 --> 01:30:39.770
<v Speaker 1>another movie I hate called ghost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe liked it with,</v>

2003
01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:45.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family more Demi Moore and what's </v>

2004
01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:45.080
<v Speaker 1>his face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2005
01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 1>And here's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy's a ghost,</v>

2006
01:30:45.391 --> 01:30:46.110
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

2007
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.970
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2008
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:49.340
<v Speaker 1>he wants to show his long lost love </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads around.</v>

2009
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:50.430
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wonderful.</v>

2010
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.830
<v Speaker 1>So he tries to lift a penny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course it goes through his hands,</v>

2011
01:30:52.831 --> 01:30:54.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tries to hug her,</v>

2012
01:30:54.001 --> 01:30:59.001
<v Speaker 1>but it's hands go right to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you noticed each time he stands on </v>

2013
01:30:59.001 --> 01:30:59.001
<v Speaker 1>the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sits on the couch.</v>

2014
01:30:59.001 --> 01:30:59.850
<v Speaker 1>He stands on the floor and sits on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>couch.</v>

2015
01:30:59.851 --> 01:31:04.851
<v Speaker 1>So his butt or his feet have some </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible ability to be stopped by </v>

2016
01:31:04.851 --> 01:31:04.851
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing else does.</v>

2017
01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:07.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw that the rest of the movie went.</v>

2018
01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about it now.</v>

2019
01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to ruin it for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just.</v>

2020
01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:14.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it when I was like 10 older.</v>

2021
01:31:14.750 --> 01:31:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It's an older movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old?</v>

2022
01:31:15.931 --> 01:31:17.430
<v Speaker 1>When is that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably wasn't 10.</v>

2023
01:31:17.431 --> 01:31:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I was probably 20 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2024
01:31:18.710 --> 01:31:20.850
<v Speaker 1>well I'm older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid movie.</v>

2025
01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:21.540
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2026
01:31:21.541 --> 01:31:21.930
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2027
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:24.300
<v Speaker 1>but for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm saying is the minute I saw that</v>

2028
01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:26.160
<v Speaker 1>it was hard for me to enjoy the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movie.</v>

2029
01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Plus they have an unhealed bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also sounds stupid.</v>

2030
01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:33.600
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes,</v>

2031
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:36.130
<v Speaker 1>sometimes something like that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in.</v>

2032
01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:38.970
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be watching a drama and you say,</v>

2033
01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.130
<v Speaker 1>why the hell did they do that?</v>

2034
01:31:41.310 --> 01:31:43.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just how to share Sheriff Dermot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2035
01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:44.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2036
01:31:44.011 --> 01:31:49.011
<v Speaker 1>And then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's hard for you to enjoy the </v>

2037
01:31:49.011 --> 01:31:49.011
<v Speaker 1>rest of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2038
01:31:49.011 --> 01:31:49.230
<v Speaker 1>I find that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a real issue with that.</v>

2039
01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:54.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about artificial </v>

2040
01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:58.191
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you consider like one of the things </v>

2041
01:31:58.191 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 1>that freaks me out is that what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider life will,</v>

2042
01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:03.850
<v Speaker 1>when we think about instincts and needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and desires,</v>

2043
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:09.750
<v Speaker 1>those won't necessarily be programmed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all into any artificial life.</v>

2044
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the questions that arises,</v>

2045
01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:16.981
<v Speaker 1>and this is a huge point of discussion </v>
<v Speaker 1>among ai researchers because I've been </v>

2046
01:32:16.981 --> 01:32:17.920
<v Speaker 1>to a bunch of meetings in preparation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for our meeting is whether,</v>

2047
01:32:18.530 --> 01:32:23.530
<v Speaker 1>and I find the statement almost vacuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm amazed that they use it all the </v>

2048
01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:24.790
<v Speaker 1>time to program machines with human </v>
<v Speaker 1>values,</v>

2049
01:32:25.570 --> 01:32:26.950
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would we be programming?</v>

2050
01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.650
<v Speaker 1>And my problem is what our human values.</v>

2051
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.180
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2052
01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:32.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very smart guy and I won't,</v>

2053
01:32:32.921 --> 01:32:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I won't say who said this meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2054
01:32:34.781 --> 01:32:36.670
<v Speaker 1>they just have to watch us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

2055
01:32:36.671 --> 01:32:37.840
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean they watched Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump?</v>

2056
01:32:37.841 --> 01:32:39.340
<v Speaker 1>And they know what human values are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2057
01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:44.650
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure there are universal human </v>

2058
01:32:44.650 --> 01:32:45.640
<v Speaker 1>values and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we program them in.</v>

2059
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:49.000
<v Speaker 1>But neverless the question is do we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to align their programming?</v>

2060
01:32:49.001 --> 01:32:54.001
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In terms of what we think will be </v>

2061
01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:54.001
<v Speaker 1>beneficial to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2062
01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Because after all we're programming </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2063
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:58.540
<v Speaker 1>so we do do we in part St [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>values?</v>

2064
01:32:58.930 --> 01:32:59.860
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2065
01:32:59.861 --> 01:33:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I find that a very interesting question </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a very difficult one to resolve.</v>

2066
01:33:03.641 --> 01:33:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I my own feeling is if it were up to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I am not,</v>

2067
01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:09.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not an area of active research for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2068
01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:12.220
<v Speaker 1>You produce the smartest machines you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2069
01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Just like you have kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have kids.</v>

2070
01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Do we want them to believe everything we</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe?</v>

2071
01:33:17.621 --> 01:33:18.490
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to give them.</v>

2072
01:33:18.670 --> 01:33:23.670
<v Speaker 1>We want them to become the most capable </v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings they can be so that they </v>

2073
01:33:23.670 --> 01:33:24.010
<v Speaker 1>can go out and do the best stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2074
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:27.370
<v Speaker 1>So why is it different for computer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd want to make the most capable,</v>

2075
01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:30.460
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resourceful machine I ever could because</v>

2076
01:33:30.461 --> 01:33:34.000
<v Speaker 1>then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least all the evidence suggests to me</v>

2077
01:33:34.001 --> 01:33:35.710
<v Speaker 1>that that machine will make the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

2078
01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:41.280
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if the machine doesn't have an </v>

2079
01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.381
<v Speaker 1>ability to breed sexually and if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have ego and if it doesn't </v>

2080
01:33:43.381 --> 01:33:46.240
<v Speaker 1>necessarily have creativity because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need to be praised for its ego,</v>

2081
01:33:46.241 --> 01:33:51.241
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think creativity comes from </v>

2082
01:33:51.241 --> 01:33:51.241
<v Speaker 1>needing to be praised for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think creative,</v>

2083
01:33:51.241 --> 01:33:53.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean as another great intrinsic </v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of human beings that makes being</v>

2084
01:33:53.951 --> 01:33:55.360
<v Speaker 1>a human being worth being human being.</v>

2085
01:33:55.420 --> 01:34:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Well I think I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you're going to connect </v>

2086
01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:03.310
<v Speaker 1>that sort of mindset to a computer or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>

2087
01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:06.320
<v Speaker 1>don't you think it would have some need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create like what?</v>

2088
01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:11.330
<v Speaker 1>What is our need to create as like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to express ourselves to other </v>

2089
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:11.350
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were alone on an island,</v>

2090
01:34:11.351 --> 01:34:12.730
<v Speaker 1>do you think it would create?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2091
01:34:12.731 --> 01:34:14.560
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's of yourself forever.</v>

2092
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:17.930
<v Speaker 1>You think you would paint on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to think I would because I.</v>

2093
01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:21.430
<v Speaker 1>because I kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what I find gratifying.</v>

2094
01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:26.460
<v Speaker 1>But I think one of the things people </v>
<v Speaker 1>find gratifying is it that other people </v>

2095
01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:26.460
<v Speaker 1>are enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So no,</v>

2096
01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't do science because other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy it.</v>

2097
01:34:27.541 --> 01:34:28.990
<v Speaker 1>And do science because I enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2098
01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:30.880
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you think you would do science if</v>

2099
01:34:30.881 --> 01:34:32.020
<v Speaker 1>you were the last person on earth?</v>

2100
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:35.440
<v Speaker 1>You would be alone with what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The work I do is,</v>

2101
01:34:35.690 --> 01:34:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't want to make any </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretense.</v>

2102
01:34:37.121 --> 01:34:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I do it because it's fun for me and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think most people do it.</v>

2103
01:34:40.690 --> 01:34:44.800
<v Speaker 1>They may claim actually I shouldn't say </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people probably better than me</v>

2104
01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:50.040
<v Speaker 1>who do what they do because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly trying to save humanity in </v>

2105
01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:53.701
<v Speaker 1>one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to think what I do has a net </v>

2106
01:34:53.701 --> 01:34:56.491
<v Speaker 1>positive effect and I try to take time </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of my science to try and counter </v>

2107
01:34:56.491 --> 01:35:00.631
<v Speaker 1>things that I think are wrong with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world because I have a cause because of </v>

2108
01:35:00.631 --> 01:35:00.650
<v Speaker 1>my background and also because I have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>soapbox.</v>

2109
01:35:00.710 --> 01:35:03.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky enough to have people listen </v>
<v Speaker 1>to me for one reason or another.</v>

2110
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:05.960
<v Speaker 1>So I try to take that responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

2111
01:35:06.260 --> 01:35:08.690
<v Speaker 1>But on the whole I do what I do because </v>
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy doing it.</v>

2112
01:35:08.690 --> 01:35:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I think most of us do and we only do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're only good at it if we're good at </v>

2113
01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:15.860
<v Speaker 1>it because we enjoy it and look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example,</v>

2114
01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:21.010
<v Speaker 1>so the best one of the best machine </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning machines and existence just </v>

2115
01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:24.150
<v Speaker 1>beat the best go player in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2116
01:35:24.230 --> 01:35:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to do it.</v>

2117
01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:26.690
<v Speaker 1>It learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>

2118
01:35:26.691 --> 01:35:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught itself to you better go,</v>

2119
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:31.610
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's creativity if you want.</v>

2120
01:35:31.820 --> 01:35:33.980
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to be better at playing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

2121
01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.690
<v Speaker 1>but didn't I just calculate every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>note?</v>

2122
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:38.810
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2123
01:35:39.090 --> 01:35:39.710
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't.</v>

2124
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:45.010
<v Speaker 1>It can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it can do is try to teach itself </v>

2125
01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:47.411
<v Speaker 1>strategies that work and just creativity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look at it and it does teach itself </v>

2126
01:35:47.850 --> 01:35:52.850
<v Speaker 1>strategies at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new strategies by looking at old </v>

2127
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.970
<v Speaker 1>strategies that didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's creativity.</v>

2128
01:35:53.850 --> 01:35:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows how to define </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity in all senses,</v>

2129
01:35:56.570 --> 01:36:01.570
<v Speaker 1>but you can imagine that a sufficiently </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent computer would be creative </v>

2130
01:36:01.570 --> 01:36:02.210
<v Speaker 1>because in order to do physics and </v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

2131
01:36:02.211 --> 01:36:02.830
<v Speaker 1>you need to be creative.</v>

2132
01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:03.440
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2133
01:36:03.441 --> 01:36:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just did an event with Alan all day in</v>

2134
01:36:05.701 --> 01:36:08.130
<v Speaker 1>New York City and I all the from Mash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2135
01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's a great guy at intelligent man and</v>

2136
01:36:10.401 --> 01:36:12.350
<v Speaker 1>very interesting science and science </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

2137
01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:17.590
<v Speaker 1>We've done a few events together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One with my origins project we can see </v>

2138
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:20.910
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was interviewing me or we had a </v>

2139
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.910
<v Speaker 1>dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was interviewing me about the new</v>

2140
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:22.070
<v Speaker 1>book and and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2141
01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:24.200
<v Speaker 1>and in the context of that and science </v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

2142
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And he said something wonderful both </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in earlier he said,</v>

2143
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:32.570
<v Speaker 1>because it's so counter intuitive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern culture's reception.</v>

2144
01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:36.260
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>art requires rigor.</v>

2145
01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Science requires creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

2146
01:36:40.251 --> 01:36:42.050
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's the opposite of what most</v>

2147
01:36:42.051 --> 01:36:43.670
<v Speaker 1>people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact,</v>

2148
01:36:43.671 --> 01:36:45.140
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>art requires rigor.</v>

2149
01:36:45.260 --> 01:36:47.440
<v Speaker 1>You gotta just get just the right colors</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2150
01:36:47.610 --> 01:36:52.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and work really hard to get the right </v>

2151
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.610
<v Speaker 1>patterns.</v>

2152
01:36:52.610 --> 01:36:52.760
<v Speaker 1>Whether that art is music or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy art.</v>

2153
01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:57.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking very broadly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas to do science makes progress </v>

2154
01:36:57.780 --> 01:36:58.010
<v Speaker 1>because we're creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also rigorous,</v>

2155
01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:01.650
<v Speaker 1>but people somehow have this artsy </v>
<v Speaker 1>fartsy notion that oh,</v>

2156
01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:03.860
<v Speaker 1>artists are creative and scientists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>nerds.</v>

2157
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

2158
01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:07.400
<v Speaker 1>they're just rigorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science is just rigorous garbage.</v>

2159
01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:09.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's creative.</v>

2160
01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Just like art and art is rigorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the scientists who say,</v>

2161
01:37:13.131 --> 01:37:14.090
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these artists,</v>

2162
01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:15.470
<v Speaker 1>these musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

2163
01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:20.740
<v Speaker 1>they're not as good as we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're equally bad because the art and </v>

2164
01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.640
<v Speaker 1>doing anything well requires rigor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>

2165
01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.260
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rigor.</v>

2166
01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>dichotomy,</v>

2167
01:37:26.740 --> 01:37:31.740
<v Speaker 1>that juxtaposition of art and rigor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>science and creativity is something </v>

2168
01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:35.921
<v Speaker 1>wonderful that Alan said and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should realize that it's a </v>

2169
01:37:35.921 --> 01:37:36.950
<v Speaker 1>characteristic science is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does involve creativity and rigor,</v>

2170
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:41.920
<v Speaker 1>but so does all the areas of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity that make the,</v>

2171
01:37:42.230 --> 01:37:43.700
<v Speaker 1>the story of humans so wonderful.</v>

2172
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:46.310
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's the greatest story ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>told so far.</v>

2173
01:37:46.780 --> 01:37:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

2174
01:37:47.211 --> 01:37:51.170
<v Speaker 1>many aspects of human life require </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

2175
01:37:51.210 --> 01:37:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Many endeavors right here and right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether you're a better kickboxer,</v>

2176
01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of creativity and </v>

2177
01:37:59.340 --> 01:37:59.340
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eager to learn rules.</v>

2178
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discipline your muscles over and over </v>

2179
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:04.270
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any sportsperson and maybe there's even,</v>

2180
01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:05.400
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's even creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>

2181
01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:06.180
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2182
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:07.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2183
01:38:07.461 --> 01:38:12.461
<v Speaker 1>there's Gregor and creativity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that humans push to the limits.</v>

2184
01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2185
01:38:13.351 --> 01:38:15.870
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question would be,</v>

2186
01:38:16.110 --> 01:38:20.550
<v Speaker 1>what would the motivation of artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence be if it's not,</v>

2187
01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:25.820
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were essentially riding on the </v>

2188
01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:27.890
<v Speaker 1>motivations of our ancient genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to have sex for gas.</v>

2189
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it'd be interesting to see those.</v>

2190
01:38:31.170 --> 01:38:32.550
<v Speaker 1>What would it be interesting to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

2191
01:38:32.730 --> 01:38:33.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2192
01:38:33.091 --> 01:38:36.690
<v Speaker 1>what would their motivation to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative because because we've.</v>

2193
01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:41.900
<v Speaker 1>We've developed in them problem solving </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities and because they're self </v>

2194
01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:44.220
<v Speaker 1>aware and the amount of asked questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're self aware.</v>

2195
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 1>They may want to improve their </v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the world.</v>

2196
01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Partly for technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may want to make the world better </v>

2197
01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:51.930
<v Speaker 1>for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of reasons,</v>

2198
01:38:51.931 --> 01:38:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

2199
01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Have to some extent will import it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it programming,</v>

2200
01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.800
<v Speaker 1>but to some extent we'll see and to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that's terrifying that we won't </v>

2201
01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:02.700
<v Speaker 1>know the motivations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not as terrified about it.</v>

2202
01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:07.760
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm concerned that we got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make sure we understand what we're doing</v>

2203
01:39:08.081 --> 01:39:13.081
<v Speaker 1>at each step so we don't produce massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative results that could have been </v>

2204
01:39:13.081 --> 01:39:16.170
<v Speaker 1>avoided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not as concerned that the future</v>

2205
01:39:16.171 --> 01:39:19.020
<v Speaker 1>will be different than the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it is.</v>

2206
01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.560
<v Speaker 1>When you see some of the emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies like Crispr,</v>

2207
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:30.800
<v Speaker 1>some of these genetic engineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies where they're starting to </v>

2208
01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:34.290
<v Speaker 1>use non-viable human fetuses and run </v>
<v Speaker 1>some tests on them,</v>

2209
01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:36.900
<v Speaker 1>are you concerned at all about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you concerned about,</v>

2210
01:39:37.170 --> 01:39:42.170
<v Speaker 1>or I shouldn't need to use this term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term concern because obviously </v>

2211
01:39:42.170 --> 01:39:42.170
<v Speaker 1>you're obviously mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2212
01:39:42.170 --> 01:39:42.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2213
01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:44.130
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned has happened.</v>

2214
01:39:44.210 --> 01:39:44.760
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2215
01:39:44.761 --> 01:39:45.900
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just let things happen.</v>

2216
01:39:46.980 --> 01:39:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Let Watch what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to anticipate the results,</v>

2217
01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:56.900
<v Speaker 1>understand them in detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipate what the results are and </v>

2218
01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:57.240
<v Speaker 1>avoid negative ones to the extent you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

2219
01:39:57.690 --> 01:39:59.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's life is all about the things </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to change,</v>

2220
01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:02.280
<v Speaker 1>but to accept the fact that things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna change and if and,</v>

2221
01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:04.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2222
01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:09.670
<v Speaker 1>that's why aren't we happy that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is different than it was during </v>

2223
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:09.670
<v Speaker 1>medieval times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2224
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:14.390
<v Speaker 1>except for you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Pence and other people with the </v>

2225
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:18.351
<v Speaker 1>rest of us are happy or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can pick a lot of radio </v>

2226
01:40:18.351 --> 01:40:18.870
<v Speaker 1>commentators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most of us are happy that we,</v>

2227
01:40:18.871 --> 01:40:21.780
<v Speaker 1>that the world has gotten more open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more interesting.</v>

2228
01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And so that's part of the human drama is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's going to go places and we </v>

2229
01:40:27.451 --> 01:40:29.550
<v Speaker 1>don't know where it's going to go and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay,</v>

2230
01:40:29.551 --> 01:40:34.551
<v Speaker 1>but we should all work as much as we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and make sure to the extent that </v>

2231
01:40:34.551 --> 01:40:38.721
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the direction of heads is a good </v>

2232
01:40:38.721 --> 01:40:38.721
<v Speaker 1>one is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is beneficial,</v>

2233
01:40:38.721 --> 01:40:38.850
<v Speaker 1>more interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more exciting,</v>

2234
01:40:39.090 --> 01:40:43.500
<v Speaker 1>more possibilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more fun for everybody and,</v>

2235
01:40:43.501 --> 01:40:48.501
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even more sustainable because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems reasonable that it should be </v>

2236
01:40:48.501 --> 01:40:52.041
<v Speaker 1>sustainable if we think we care about </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just our children but our </v>

2237
01:40:52.041 --> 01:40:55.461
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren and their grandchildren.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that it's self interest in some </v>

2238
01:40:55.461 --> 01:40:55.461
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2239
01:40:55.461 --> 01:40:59.890
<v Speaker 1>to be interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conservation and sustainability </v>

2240
01:40:59.890 --> 01:41:00.790
<v Speaker 1>instead of immediate profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you really have,</v>

2241
01:41:00.810 --> 01:41:01.330
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2242
01:41:01.331 --> 01:41:04.690
<v Speaker 1>might say if I amass enough wealth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>my children will be fine forever and who</v>

2243
01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.940
<v Speaker 1>gives a damn about the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's children.</v>

2244
01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:12.420
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can decide that maybe it's in the </v>

2245
01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:15.721
<v Speaker 1>best interests of everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If humans societies sustainable because </v>

2246
01:41:15.721 --> 01:41:17.380
<v Speaker 1>there'll be less likelihood for extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more extreme violence,</v>

2247
01:41:17.381 --> 01:41:17.620
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2248
01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:18.010
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can.</v>

2249
01:41:18.460 --> 01:41:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I would argue that we behave well in </v>
<v Speaker 1>large part because of reason and and and</v>

2250
01:41:24.461 --> 01:41:25.570
<v Speaker 1>my point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had this,</v>

2251
01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:30.640
<v Speaker 1>we had a session in my origins project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole meeting on the origins of </v>

2252
01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.441
<v Speaker 1>morality and and I've had this debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a number of colleagues who point </v>

2253
01:41:34.441 --> 01:41:37.921
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was hume who said you can't </v>

2254
01:41:37.921 --> 01:41:39.481
<v Speaker 1>get ought from is okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get off from it is just by </v>

2255
01:41:39.481 --> 01:41:40.540
<v Speaker 1>rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't decide how to behave.</v>

2256
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

2257
01:41:42.100 --> 01:41:47.100
<v Speaker 1>but here's the point without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you can never get to ot without </v>

2258
01:41:47.100 --> 01:41:49.330
<v Speaker 1>knowing the consequences of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>actions,</v>

2259
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:53.680
<v Speaker 1>which is what science is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't decide what's good and bad and</v>

2260
01:41:53.681 --> 01:41:58.681
<v Speaker 1>so science and reason is an essential </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of any progress because we can't </v>

2261
01:41:59.981 --> 01:42:04.981
<v Speaker 1>possibly decide what economic policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>to enact or what or what social policies</v>

2262
01:42:05.591 --> 01:42:10.591
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what technological policies if we don't </v>

2263
01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:10.591
<v Speaker 1>know the consequences of actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>

2264
01:42:10.591 --> 01:42:11.800
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's an example.</v>

2265
01:42:11.801 --> 01:42:16.801
<v Speaker 1>It was so stupid for the Republicans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>design this healthcare policy and </v>

2266
01:42:16.801 --> 01:42:19.180
<v Speaker 1>promoted before anyone in analyzed say </v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic impact of it.</v>

2267
01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could have still decided to do it.</v>

2268
01:42:21.581 --> 01:42:26.581
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least that data would have been </v>

2269
01:42:26.581 --> 01:42:28.840
<v Speaker 1>useful for making a final decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that simple.</v>

2270
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:35.880
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess getting back to that crispr </v>

2271
01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.311
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that becomes available and if it </v>

2272
01:42:38.311 --> 01:42:42.630
<v Speaker 1>advances to the point where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>available to people that are alive </v>

2273
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:42.630
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would would you,</v>

2274
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:46.800
<v Speaker 1>would you give it a shot?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you change anything about </v>

2275
01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:46.800
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you become thor?</v>

2276
01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:51.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it really gets to that point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we can worry about a lot of </v>

2277
01:42:51.170 --> 01:42:54.241
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not anywhere near as worried </v>

2278
01:42:54.241 --> 01:42:54.241
<v Speaker 1>about that as am hacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2279
01:42:54.241 --> 01:42:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if we can hack computers and if </v>

2280
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.350
<v Speaker 1>you can hack the DNA as a lot of kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>

2281
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:59.770
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was told years ago,</v>

2282
01:42:59.980 --> 01:43:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm chairman of the board of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>called the bulletin of atomic scientists</v>

2283
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:07.950
<v Speaker 1>that have the board of sponsors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>sets the doomsday clock every year and </v>

2284
01:43:07.950 --> 01:43:08.260
<v Speaker 1>so we have to think about existential </v>
<v Speaker 1>threats to mankind.</v>

2285
01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:09.850
<v Speaker 1>I remember about seven or eight years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2286
01:43:09.851 --> 01:43:13.330
<v Speaker 1>we had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fresher from mit who said his computer</v>

2287
01:43:13.331 --> 01:43:15.670
<v Speaker 1>science students were most interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>hacking DNA.</v>

2288
01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Much more interested than hacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just an attitude,</v>

2289
01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:23.820
<v Speaker 1>it's just a code and and so if you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulate arbitrarily in a very precise</v>

2290
01:43:24.161 --> 01:43:24.970
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA,</v>

2291
01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.600
<v Speaker 1>then of course there are many good </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that can come and maybe you can </v>

2292
01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:30.600
<v Speaker 1>make yourself stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

2293
01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:31.530
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're not you,</v>

2294
01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:32.710
<v Speaker 1>maybe your children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2295
01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:35.050
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you can overcome genetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>

2296
01:43:35.051 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 1>which of course would be great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can also with,</v>

2297
01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:43.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with great power comes great </v>

2298
01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.031
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with that you can also imagine </v>

2299
01:43:45.031 --> 01:43:45.031
<v Speaker 1>hacking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2300
01:43:45.031 --> 01:43:45.640
<v Speaker 1>And creating new viruses or whatever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

2301
01:43:45.670 --> 01:43:47.080
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2302
01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:52.140
<v Speaker 1>it's any new technology is terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does mean we shouldn't create new </v>

2303
01:43:52.161 --> 01:43:53.120
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2304
01:43:53.121 --> 01:43:55.050
<v Speaker 1>cars are terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cars kill.</v>

2305
01:43:55.051 --> 01:43:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Look how many people cars get killed now</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll have self driving cars.</v>

2306
01:43:58.101 --> 01:44:03.101
<v Speaker 1>Maybe fewer people die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are afraid of self driving </v>

2307
01:44:03.101 --> 01:44:06.041
<v Speaker 1>cars because they do present moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems and it's as if a car is </v>

2308
01:44:06.041 --> 01:44:10.661
<v Speaker 1>designed to minimize the number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people it kills and it can do that by </v>

2309
01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:14.591
<v Speaker 1>killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're faced with running into five </v>

2310
01:44:14.591 --> 01:44:15.020
<v Speaker 1>school children or the car turning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting a wall,</v>

2311
01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:18.510
<v Speaker 1>what do you want your car program to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2312
01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.960
<v Speaker 1>these are fascinating questions we will </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to address,</v>

2313
01:44:21.380 --> 01:44:26.380
<v Speaker 1>but technology can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so technology can be used in many ways </v>

2314
01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:27.420
<v Speaker 1>and it's terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

2315
01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:32.120
<v Speaker 1>it's trite to use this old expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do think of it at times,</v>

2316
01:44:32.121 --> 01:44:35.530
<v Speaker 1>which is that the little thing I gave </v>
<v Speaker 1>him a stepdaughter once,</v>

2317
01:44:35.531 --> 01:44:40.531
<v Speaker 1>it said ships are safe in the harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what ships are meant to </v>

2318
01:44:40.531 --> 01:44:40.531
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

2319
01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can,</v>

2320
01:44:44.150 --> 01:44:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you can bury your head in the sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can never go outside the house for </v>

2321
01:44:49.150 --> 01:44:51.290
<v Speaker 1>fear of being run over by a car or being</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassed or whatever.</v>

2322
01:44:51.500 --> 01:44:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Or you can choose to live a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's your choice.</v>

2323
01:44:55.730 --> 01:45:00.730
<v Speaker 1>But to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living the life as it is more </v>

2324
01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:00.730
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it in,</v>

2325
01:45:00.730 --> 01:45:01.240
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

2326
01:45:01.241 --> 01:45:04.820
<v Speaker 1>in the book I point out you can choose </v>
<v Speaker 1>how to look at the world.</v>

2327
01:45:04.821 --> 01:45:09.821
<v Speaker 1>You can choose to say you're the center </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the universe and if that makes you </v>

2328
01:45:09.821 --> 01:45:09.821
<v Speaker 1>feel better finding the universe was </v>
<v Speaker 1>created for you,</v>

2329
01:45:09.821 --> 01:45:14.410
<v Speaker 1>or you can choose to let your beliefs </v>
<v Speaker 1>conform to the evidence of reality and </v>

2330
01:45:14.410 --> 01:45:17.090
<v Speaker 1>go and assume the universe exists in </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolved independent of your existence,</v>

2331
01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:20.090
<v Speaker 1>and in that case you're bound to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised.</v>

2332
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:25.450
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it better to be able to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>life full of surprises and a life that </v>

2333
01:45:25.450 --> 01:45:25.450
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any?</v>

2334
01:45:25.450 --> 01:45:25.450
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a wonderful philosophy.</v>

2335
01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:30.600
<v Speaker 3>What I'm thinking is I'm wondering about</v>
<v Speaker 3>these technological advancements when it</v>

2336
01:45:30.601 --> 01:45:35.601
<v Speaker 3>comes to the ability to manipulate the </v>
<v Speaker 3>human body and when they get to the </v>

2337
01:45:35.601 --> 01:45:39.111
<v Speaker 3>point where we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't have the same issues that we </v>

2338
01:45:39.111 --> 01:45:42.141
<v Speaker 3>have today with diseases and when </v>
<v Speaker 3>injuries or even with a biological </v>

2339
01:45:42.141 --> 01:45:43.830
<v Speaker 3>inferiorities with everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looks like Lebron James.</v>

2340
01:45:43.831 --> 01:45:44.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2341
01:45:44.221 --> 01:45:44.550
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2342
01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:47.180
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2343
01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:52.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect people will want different </v>

2344
01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:52.900
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>

2345
01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 1>That'll be a very different world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at this way.</v>

2346
01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a pretty buff guy.</v>

2347
01:45:57.710 --> 01:45:59.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You manipulated your body,</v>

2348
01:45:59.240 --> 01:45:59.870
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2349
01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with that?</v>

2350
01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:02.180
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing,</v>

2351
01:46:02.181 --> 01:46:03.920
<v Speaker 3>but I'm still five foot eight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2352
01:46:04.110 --> 01:46:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Lebron James is seven feet tall and </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulated his body.</v>

2353
01:46:06.771 --> 01:46:09.500
<v Speaker 3>It's a very different deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone gives me a seven foot tall pill.</v>

2354
01:46:09.501 --> 01:46:10.270
<v Speaker 3>I might take it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2355
01:46:10.271 --> 01:46:12.890
<v Speaker 3>but you manipulate your body given the </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology of the time.</v>

2356
01:46:13.190 --> 01:46:13.810
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you did what?</v>

2357
01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:18.820
<v Speaker 3>You do changes and everyone can seven </v>
<v Speaker 3>feet tall and it was at worse because </v>

2358
01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.210
<v Speaker 3>you can manipulate because you know </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough physiology now or whatever.</v>

2359
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:25.270
<v Speaker 3>Exercise physiology that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>manipulate your body more efficiently </v>

2360
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:28.511
<v Speaker 3>now than you could before and people can</v>
<v Speaker 3>run faster miles or jump higher because </v>

2361
01:46:29.001 --> 01:46:32.360
<v Speaker 3>we've been sports for forever and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's okay.</v>

2362
01:46:32.361 --> 01:46:33.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>

2363
01:46:33.470 --> 01:46:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm just wondered what your thoughts are</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the future.</v>

2364
01:46:36.260 --> 01:46:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I physiological imbalance.</v>

2365
01:46:39.081 --> 01:46:41.140
<v Speaker 3>I try to anticipate the abilities</v>

2366
01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:46.140
<v Speaker 1>and to the extent I can discuss what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are so that we as a society could </v>

2367
01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.220
<v Speaker 1>address them more cogently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not.</v>

2368
01:46:48.221 --> 01:46:53.221
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally predictions about anything </v>

2369
01:46:53.221 --> 01:46:53.221
<v Speaker 1>less than 2 trillion years in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

2370
01:46:56.790 --> 01:47:01.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a great quote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen 2 trillion years </v>

2371
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:02.940
<v Speaker 1>when the universe expanding to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cooling off and everything dies.</v>

2372
01:47:02.941 --> 01:47:06.210
<v Speaker 1>There's two reasons for that statement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is it's pretty simple.</v>

2373
01:47:06.211 --> 01:47:11.211
<v Speaker 1>When you start thinking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm is the universe is probably </v>

2374
01:47:11.211 --> 01:47:11.211
<v Speaker 1>going to expand forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the galaxies,</v>

2375
01:47:11.211 --> 01:47:11.211
<v Speaker 1>and if it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun's burning out.</v>

2376
01:47:11.211 --> 01:47:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point is if it doesn't do that,</v>

2377
01:47:12.721 --> 01:47:14.820
<v Speaker 1>no one's gonna know I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good point.</v>

2378
01:47:15.240 --> 01:47:16.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2379
01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:18.700
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's why.</v>

2380
01:47:18.810 --> 01:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's my general.</v>

2381
01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I've read a quote once about </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermassive black holes that has </v>

2382
01:47:24.890 --> 01:47:26.220
<v Speaker 1>matched with my brain ever since I read </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2383
01:47:26.300 --> 01:47:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the quote was that inside every </v>

2384
01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:35.181
<v Speaker 1>galaxy is a supermassive black hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one half of one percent of the </v>

2385
01:47:35.181 --> 01:47:39.411
<v Speaker 1>mass of the galaxy and that it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that inside that supermassive </v>

2386
01:47:39.690 --> 01:47:42.960
<v Speaker 1>black hole is a whole nother universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2387
01:47:42.961 --> 01:47:44.760
<v Speaker 1>the up to up to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

2388
01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Up to that point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's fine.</v>

2389
01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Everything sounded fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2390
01:47:47.850 --> 01:47:52.850
<v Speaker 1>It is true that it's amazing that most </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies that we can measure have large </v>

2391
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:53.980
<v Speaker 1>black holes on center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leads to an inch.</v>

2392
01:47:53.981 --> 01:47:55.200
<v Speaker 1>The question we don't have the answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2393
01:47:55.290 --> 01:48:00.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons we're building the </v>

2394
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.290
<v Speaker 1>James Webb space telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The James,</v>

2395
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:03.291
<v Speaker 1>what James Webb Space Telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that's going to replace the </v>

2396
01:48:03.291 --> 01:48:03.291
<v Speaker 1>Hubble space colors that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that going to be in space?</v>

2397
01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2398
01:48:03.691 --> 01:48:08.691
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be much further orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be launched next year and </v>

2399
01:48:08.691 --> 01:48:12.711
<v Speaker 1>it's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the successor to James Webb is </v>

2400
01:48:12.711 --> 01:48:12.711
<v Speaker 1>going to be 100 times the the collection</v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

2401
01:48:12.711 --> 01:48:13.170
<v Speaker 1>It's going to look at different </v>
<v Speaker 1>wavelengths of light.</v>

2402
01:48:13.171 --> 01:48:18.171
<v Speaker 1>It's going to push what Hubble has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do to look back to the earliest </v>

2403
01:48:18.171 --> 01:48:22.191
<v Speaker 1>galaxies that ever formed first light as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call them and starts first turned on </v>

2404
01:48:22.191 --> 01:48:22.600
<v Speaker 1>the first stars that formed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

2405
01:48:22.601 --> 01:48:24.930
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a chicken and egg question.</v>

2406
01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:27.870
<v Speaker 1>If most galaxies have supermassive black</v>
<v Speaker 1>holes in them,</v>

2407
01:48:28.410 --> 01:48:33.410
<v Speaker 1>which came first and did the black holes</v>
<v Speaker 1>form and that was necessary for the </v>

2408
01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:36.550
<v Speaker 1>galaxies to coalesce around them or did </v>
<v Speaker 1>the galaxies existed,</v>

2409
01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:41.560
<v Speaker 1>and then the black holes built up </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchically by swallowing things and </v>

2410
01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.000
<v Speaker 1>getting bigger and bigger and bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a question we don't know the answer</v>

2411
01:48:42.001 --> 01:48:43.680
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we build that thing,</v>

2412
01:48:43.681 --> 01:48:46.380
<v Speaker 1>we might have the answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be an interesting question that we</v>

2413
01:48:46.381 --> 01:48:51.381
<v Speaker 1>resolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing that as far as we can </v>

2414
01:48:51.381 --> 01:48:54.381
<v Speaker 1>tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these supermassive black holes exist </v>

2415
01:48:54.381 --> 01:48:54.381
<v Speaker 1>even though we don't know they're black </v>
<v Speaker 1>holes.</v>

2416
01:48:54.381 --> 01:48:57.740
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know they kind of looked like black </v>

2417
01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:57.840
<v Speaker 1>holes and quack like black holes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk like black hole black holes,</v>

2418
01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:03.200
<v Speaker 1>but we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I mean is there we can tell their </v>

2419
01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:04.170
<v Speaker 1>mass contra concentrations that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>immense.</v>

2420
01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:09.500
<v Speaker 1>A billion solar masses in a region so </v>
<v Speaker 1>small that our theories tell us they </v>

2421
01:49:09.500 --> 01:49:11.670
<v Speaker 1>should be a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know if,</v>

2422
01:49:11.730 --> 01:49:12.330
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

2423
01:49:12.630 --> 01:49:16.350
<v Speaker 1>if the consequences of generality tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>us that they are black holes,</v>

2424
01:49:16.351 --> 01:49:21.351
<v Speaker 1>but we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The simplest assumption is that they </v>

2425
01:49:21.351 --> 01:49:21.351
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nothing escapes from them,</v>

2426
01:49:21.351 --> 01:49:25.190
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they formed classically like black </v>

2427
01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:25.190
<v Speaker 1>holes and they're fascinating and we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn about.</v>

2428
01:49:25.190 --> 01:49:29.870
<v Speaker 1>We're learning about black holes by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way or putative black holes in ways we </v>

2429
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:31.230
<v Speaker 1>never thought we could because we now </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a new window in the universe.</v>

2430
01:49:31.530 --> 01:49:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Gravitational waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

2431
01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:38.160
<v Speaker 1>this ligo detector just detected graves </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitational waves from colliding black</v>

2432
01:49:38.221 --> 01:49:43.221
<v Speaker 1>holes to coalesce and just discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the predictions of general </v>

2433
01:49:43.221 --> 01:49:43.230
<v Speaker 1>relativity or validated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole.</v>

2434
01:49:43.290 --> 01:49:48.290
<v Speaker 1>We're like Galileo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he first turned his telescope to </v>

2435
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:48.580
<v Speaker 1>the heavens and saw the moons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jupiter,</v>

2436
01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:53.970
<v Speaker 1>we've just opened a new window on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe and it will be the new </v>

2437
01:49:53.970 --> 01:49:57.361
<v Speaker 1>astronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 21st and 22nd centuries and we will </v>

2438
01:49:57.361 --> 01:50:00.541
<v Speaker 1>learn things we had no knowledge about </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that new window will reveal to </v>

2439
01:50:00.541 --> 01:50:03.970
<v Speaker 1>us the dynamics of black holes in ways </v>
<v Speaker 1>we never thought possible.</v>

2440
01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's an amazing time to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I attended.</v>

2441
01:50:06.670 --> 01:50:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Think that's also a time invariant </v>
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

2442
01:50:08.680 --> 01:50:09.610
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

2443
01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:11.500
<v Speaker 1>so everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the black.</v>

2444
01:50:11.590 --> 01:50:16.590
<v Speaker 1>But what happens inside black holes is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>question that's much different and the </v>

2445
01:50:16.871 --> 01:50:20.350
<v Speaker 1>answer is we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

2446
01:50:20.351 --> 01:50:25.351
<v Speaker 1>We know classically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if general relativity tells us what's </v>

2447
01:50:25.351 --> 01:50:28.051
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know that this things will collapse </v>

2448
01:50:28.051 --> 01:50:28.560
<v Speaker 1>to an infinitely dance singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2449
01:50:28.570 --> 01:50:33.570
<v Speaker 1>most of us physicists think infinite is </v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty bad word that in than in </v>

2450
01:50:33.570 --> 01:50:37.350
<v Speaker 1>physical reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things don't get into dense that the </v>

2451
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:39.631
<v Speaker 1>laws of quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to change things and when </v>

2452
01:50:39.631 --> 01:50:43.351
<v Speaker 1>things get sufficiently dense so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics has to be applied to </v>

2453
01:50:43.351 --> 01:50:46.681
<v Speaker 1>gravity and the only time that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens operationally or either the </v>

2454
01:50:47.591 --> 01:50:50.740
<v Speaker 1>beginning of our universe when our </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire observable universe was in,</v>

2455
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:55.870
<v Speaker 1>in potentially and infinitely dense </v>
<v Speaker 1>singularity or at the center of black </v>

2456
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.870
<v Speaker 1>holes.</v>

2457
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:56.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the only places where that </v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

2458
01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:00.310
<v Speaker 1>When quantum mechanics must be applied </v>
<v Speaker 1>to gravity.</v>

2459
01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Our current physical theories breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we don't know what happens in the </v>

2460
01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:07.360
<v Speaker 1>ultimate state of black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

2461
01:51:07.361 --> 01:51:10.210
<v Speaker 1>One possibility is indeed they do our </v>
<v Speaker 1>portal to another universe.</v>

2462
01:51:10.570 --> 01:51:15.570
<v Speaker 1>Because what's really interesting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when what you see from the inside of a </v>

2463
01:51:15.570 --> 01:51:15.910
<v Speaker 1>black hole and the outside are very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2464
01:51:16.330 --> 01:51:20.770
<v Speaker 1>If you're inside of a black hole in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space could look like it's expanding.</v>

2465
01:51:21.430 --> 01:51:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Whereas outside the black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can look like the black hole is </v>

2466
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:26.430
<v Speaker 1>contracting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

2467
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Because general activity tells you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2468
01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:33.960
<v Speaker 1>that your perceptions of what space is </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing around you in some sense depends </v>

2469
01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:37.260
<v Speaker 1>upon your the gravitational </v>
<v Speaker 1>configuration in which you live.</v>

2470
01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:42.310
<v Speaker 1>You live in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can be moving and standing still at </v>

2471
01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:44.410
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing it right now.</v>

2472
01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not moving much with respect to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a little bit of coffee so I'm </v>

2473
01:51:49.980 --> 01:51:52.651
<v Speaker 1>shaking a little bit but but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but relative to a radio conversations </v>

2474
01:51:53.141 --> 01:51:56.770
<v Speaker 1>that are happening in the studio at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other end of the visible universe,</v>

2475
01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:01.980
<v Speaker 1>we're moving away at the speed of light </v>
<v Speaker 1>and those individuals having that </v>

2476
01:52:01.980 --> 01:52:02.680
<v Speaker 1>conversation are also at rest and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>local surroundings,</v>

2477
01:52:02.980 --> 01:52:04.750
<v Speaker 1>but they're moving away from us at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of light.</v>

2478
01:52:05.050 --> 01:52:08.020
<v Speaker 1>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because locally spaces at rest,</v>

2479
01:52:08.290 --> 01:52:13.290
<v Speaker 1>but globally space is expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So generativity says that what you </v>

2480
01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:18.571
<v Speaker 1>consider to be happening to space around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you depends on your local environment </v>

2481
01:52:18.581 --> 01:52:21.730
<v Speaker 1>and what you defined so you can locally </v>
<v Speaker 1>be at rest,</v>

2482
01:52:21.940 --> 01:52:24.220
<v Speaker 1>but globally be part of an expanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

2483
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of a black hole,</v>

2484
01:52:26.501 --> 01:52:31.501
<v Speaker 1>the direction of time reverses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out because space and time are </v>

2485
01:52:31.501 --> 01:52:32.530
<v Speaker 1>tied together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you see so,</v>

2486
01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:36.130
<v Speaker 1>so what you perceive inside of a black </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole to be happening,</v>

2487
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:37.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2488
01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:42.620
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the time evolution of the system </v>

2489
01:52:42.620 --> 01:52:45.290
<v Speaker 1>you're in would be very different than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's seen from outside to be happening</v>

2490
01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:46.820
<v Speaker 1>at the surface of the black hole.</v>

2491
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:52.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whack holes are fascinating and there </v>

2492
01:52:52.090 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 1>are laboratories of the boat that allow </v>
<v Speaker 1>us to focus on the physics.</v>

2493
01:52:53.451 --> 01:52:56.570
<v Speaker 1>We can't yet fully understand how long </v>
<v Speaker 1>have we known about them?</v>

2494
01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:02.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a black hole was first </v>

2495
01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:02.560
<v Speaker 1>thought about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2496
01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:06.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people wondered whether what was the </v>

2497
01:53:06.640 --> 01:53:08.081
<v Speaker 1>ultimate state of gravitational collapse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people that argued that maybe the </v>

2498
01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:10.610
<v Speaker 1>ultimate state of gravitation collapse </v>
<v Speaker 1>was these things called that we now call</v>

2499
01:53:10.611 --> 01:53:12.920
<v Speaker 1>black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a big debate about it.</v>

2500
01:53:12.921 --> 01:53:15.290
<v Speaker 1>Oppenheimer and Snyder in the 19 forties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fifties,</v>

2501
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:18.260
<v Speaker 1>the person who first named black holes </v>
<v Speaker 1>was John Wheeler.</v>

2502
01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:24.180
<v Speaker 1>It amuses me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came up with the term black hole in </v>

2503
01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:27.041
<v Speaker 1>1965 or something like that to describe </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate state of collapsing met </v>

2504
01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:32.140
<v Speaker 1>people felt it was impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'd be that physically forces would </v>

2505
01:53:32.140 --> 01:53:36.281
<v Speaker 1>stop things from collapsing to the kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of densities that black holes would </v>

2506
01:53:36.281 --> 01:53:40.301
<v Speaker 1>format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but based on the work of Sake Saker and </v>

2507
01:53:40.301 --> 01:53:42.821
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was discovered that if you have a </v>

2508
01:53:42.821 --> 01:53:44.771
<v Speaker 1>more massive object that's massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough nuclear forces and all other </v>

2509
01:53:44.771 --> 01:53:48.851
<v Speaker 1>forces cannot fight against </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravitational collapse and eventually </v>

2510
01:53:48.851 --> 01:53:50.180
<v Speaker 1>things will collapse inside of what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>call the event horizon.</v>

2511
01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:53.690
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate say clap that it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>hugely debated in the thirties,</v>

2512
01:53:53.691 --> 01:53:54.650
<v Speaker 1>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties.</v>

2513
01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:58.160
<v Speaker 1>By the 19 sixties it was accepted and </v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>

2514
01:53:58.550 --> 01:54:02.840
<v Speaker 1>wheeler was one who first thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't happen later on,</v>

2515
01:54:02.841 --> 01:54:07.841
<v Speaker 1>came up with the name black holes and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that's one of the reasons that </v>

2516
01:54:07.841 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 1>people are so fascinated by black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turns out in Russian,</v>

2517
01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:13.460
<v Speaker 1>the term for black hole was frozen star </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't see movies made in Russia,</v>

2518
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:18.470
<v Speaker 1>but about frozen stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a lot of movies about black </v>

2519
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.470
<v Speaker 1>holes is a great name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2520
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:20.480
<v Speaker 1>And you know why the weights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it's a frozen start.</v>

2521
01:54:20.481 --> 01:54:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Let me blow your mind a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2522
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:27.620
<v Speaker 1>When objects are falling into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things you need to know is</v>

2523
01:54:27.621 --> 01:54:32.621
<v Speaker 1>the rate at which our talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our clocks tick depends on the </v>

2524
01:54:32.621 --> 01:54:35.690
<v Speaker 1>gravitational field we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm way above the earth's surface,</v>

2525
01:54:35.691 --> 01:54:38.150
<v Speaker 1>my clock is ticking at a different rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>than your clock.</v>

2526
01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:44.020
<v Speaker 1>This sounds so crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we needed every day because you </v>

2527
01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:45.170
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you use gps at all today?</v>

2528
01:54:45.980 --> 01:54:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't have worked if it wasn't for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2529
01:54:47.780 --> 01:54:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Because the clocks and the set gps </v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites are ticking at a different </v>

2530
01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:56.321
<v Speaker 1>rate than the clocks on earth because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>general relativity because they're in a </v>

2531
01:54:56.321 --> 01:54:59.801
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're higher up with respect to the </v>

2532
01:54:59.801 --> 01:54:59.801
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had to calculate.</v>

2533
01:54:59.801 --> 01:55:01.340
<v Speaker 1>We have to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use that effect to Qa to correct.</v>

2534
01:55:01.610 --> 01:55:06.610
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your GPS would go out of alignment and </v>

2535
01:55:06.610 --> 01:55:07.790
<v Speaker 1>less than one minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use it every single day.</v>

2536
01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:10.610
<v Speaker 1>So explain that please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the GPS,</v>

2537
01:55:10.760 --> 01:55:15.760
<v Speaker 1>the GPS,</v>
<v Speaker 1>global positioning satellites that are </v>

2538
01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:18.461
<v Speaker 1>in orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take into account the fact that </v>

2539
01:55:18.461 --> 01:55:21.101
<v Speaker 1>there are higher above the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their clocks are ticking more </v>

2540
01:55:21.101 --> 01:55:21.101
<v Speaker 1>slowly than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we know that?</v>

2541
01:55:21.101 --> 01:55:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Because how do they know where we are by</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a triangulation,</v>

2542
01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:25.580
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

2543
01:55:25.690 --> 01:55:27.710
<v Speaker 1>They basically look at the time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes.</v>

2544
01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:33.130
<v Speaker 1>They have atomic clocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clocks the time it takes for a signal </v>

2545
01:55:33.130 --> 01:55:36.290
<v Speaker 1>from your watch or your phone to get up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the satellite and back and that other</v>

2546
01:55:36.291 --> 01:55:39.730
<v Speaker 1>satellite and back allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 1>determine your position [inaudible].</v>

2547
01:55:40.310 --> 01:55:45.270
<v Speaker 1>But if the clock is ticking at a rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>than you get a wrong answer for the time</v>

2548
01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:48.840
<v Speaker 1>it takes for it to go on the the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number you get from that satellite.</v>

2549
01:55:48.990 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 1>When it reports to your watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it slower,</v>

2550
01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 1>faster?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2551
01:55:53.130 --> 01:55:58.130
<v Speaker 1>due to there are two effects due to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion due to its motion.</v>

2552
01:55:59.450 --> 01:56:00.460
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2553
01:56:00.510 --> 01:56:02.490
<v Speaker 1>how can I say this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically slower,</v>

2554
01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:05.370
<v Speaker 1>but due to its motion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's taking it a slower rate.</v>

2555
01:56:05.970 --> 01:56:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Due to its height in the gravitational </v>

2556
01:56:10.970 --> 01:56:11.490
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that it's faster.</v>

2557
01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.520
<v Speaker 1>So the two effects counter each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>General relativity in class and </v>

2558
01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:17.070
<v Speaker 1>specialty J in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>general relativity winds,</v>

2559
01:56:17.071 --> 01:56:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2560
01:56:19.260 --> 01:56:21.190
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ticking more slowly at.</v>

2561
01:56:21.250 --> 01:56:26.250
<v Speaker 1>I calculated once I wrote a New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>Times piece on this and I forget the </v>

2562
01:56:26.250 --> 01:56:27.300
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's something like,</v>

2563
01:56:29.650 --> 01:56:33.540
<v Speaker 1>of the order of 38 microseconds per day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're clicking,</v>

2564
01:56:33.570 --> 01:56:35.510
<v Speaker 1>they're taking at a slower rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

2565
01:56:35.830 --> 01:56:39.960
<v Speaker 1>38 millions of a second every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day different.</v>

2566
01:56:39.961 --> 01:56:44.961
<v Speaker 1>And that may not sound important to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you calculate how far light </v>

2567
01:56:44.961 --> 01:56:46.950
<v Speaker 1>travels in 38 millions of a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty far.</v>

2568
01:56:47.310 --> 01:56:49.150
<v Speaker 1>And so therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

2569
01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:54.280
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you keep getting wrong by that </v>

2570
01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:54.280
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2571
01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.100
<v Speaker 1>your determination of your position is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to keep getting wrong by that,</v>

2572
01:56:56.190 --> 01:56:57.660
<v Speaker 1>by that number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2573
01:56:57.661 --> 01:57:02.661
<v Speaker 1>and I worked out I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then this should allow me to work </v>

2574
01:57:02.661 --> 01:57:02.661
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I had a pad and paper,</v>

2575
01:57:02.661 --> 01:57:02.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a pad,</v>

2576
01:57:02.911 --> 01:57:04.470
<v Speaker 1>but I know I'm not going to do it right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now because I'm okay,</v>

2577
01:57:04.710 --> 01:57:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but I remembered you'd be out by </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like a kilometer in two </v>

2578
01:57:09.710 --> 01:57:09.710
<v Speaker 1>minutes.</v>

2579
01:57:09.710 --> 01:57:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that amazing?</v>

2580
01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.560
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we use these abstract esoteric </v>

2581
01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:17.430
<v Speaker 1>principles and they govern our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So general activity really isn't matters</v>

2582
01:57:17.431 --> 01:57:19.410
<v Speaker 1>for our technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it tells us.</v>

2583
01:57:19.740 --> 01:57:22.710
<v Speaker 1>But what's really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as objects fall into a black hole,</v>

2584
01:57:22.711 --> 01:57:27.711
<v Speaker 1>because they're getting stronger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger gravitational fields from the </v>

2585
01:57:27.711 --> 01:57:30.951
<v Speaker 1>outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see them moving more and more slowly </v>

2586
01:57:30.951 --> 01:57:34.880
<v Speaker 1>and eventually we seed them freeze at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surface we will never see from the </v>

2587
01:57:34.880 --> 01:57:39.351
<v Speaker 1>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will look like it will take an </v>

2588
01:57:39.351 --> 01:57:41.481
<v Speaker 1>infinite amount of time for an object to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall through the event horizon of a </v>

2589
01:57:41.481 --> 01:57:44.961
<v Speaker 1>black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though in its own frame it falls </v>

2590
01:57:44.961 --> 01:57:45.330
<v Speaker 1>through no problem for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will watch it slowly,</v>

2591
01:57:45.331 --> 01:57:50.331
<v Speaker 1>slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly because it's clock is literally </v>

2592
01:57:50.331 --> 01:57:51.150
<v Speaker 1>ticking at a different rate and it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>take an infinite amount of time for us,</v>

2593
01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.240
<v Speaker 1>for any object to fall through the event</v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon black hole.</v>

2594
01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:57.660
<v Speaker 1>If we're watching from the outside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why the Russians call them frozen</v>

2595
01:57:57.661 --> 01:57:59.310
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that weird?</v>

2596
01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

2597
01:58:00.661 --> 01:58:01.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2598
01:58:01.801 --> 01:58:06.801
<v Speaker 1>where did the concept come from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside every black hole is perhaps </v>

2599
01:58:06.801 --> 01:58:07.380
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of billions of galaxies each </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a black hole in front of it.</v>

2600
01:58:07.530 --> 01:58:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't.</v>

2601
01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I never heard that concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I have heard is that is that at the</v>

2602
01:58:11.881 --> 01:58:13.110
<v Speaker 1>singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the singularity,</v>

2603
01:58:13.111 --> 01:58:14.740
<v Speaker 1>maybe a portal to another universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2604
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And moreover that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that inside the black hole you </v>

2605
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.730
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine that,</v>

2606
01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:25.750
<v Speaker 1>that you're observing a space that </v>
<v Speaker 1>appears to be expanding instead of </v>

2607
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:29.121
<v Speaker 1>contracting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is it possible that those inside </v>

2608
01:58:29.121 --> 01:58:32.301
<v Speaker 1>that black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that universe would not have the same </v>

2609
01:58:32.301 --> 01:58:32.301
<v Speaker 1>laws of physics that we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2610
01:58:32.301 --> 01:58:36.681
<v Speaker 1>once it goes through the singularity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows because the laws of physics </v>

2611
01:58:36.681 --> 01:58:36.681
<v Speaker 1>breakdown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one thing I can tell you for sure is</v>

2612
01:58:36.681 --> 01:58:39.060
<v Speaker 1>there aren't millions of billions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies inside that black hole.</v>

2613
01:58:39.390 --> 01:58:44.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because gravity allows us to measure </v>

2614
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:47.030
<v Speaker 1>what the total mass of the black hole is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for in that sense of black holes it.</v>

2615
01:58:47.410 --> 01:58:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a portal that's a different </v>

2616
01:58:52.410 --> 01:58:52.410
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

2617
01:58:52.410 --> 01:58:54.900
<v Speaker 1>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after that's when then it's no </v>

2618
01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:57.391
<v Speaker 1>longer inside the black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's wonderful that the black holes </v>

2619
01:58:57.461 --> 01:58:59.350
<v Speaker 1>are just like any other stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2620
01:58:59.351 --> 01:59:00.460
<v Speaker 1>you can rub it around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2621
01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Not everything falls into a black hole </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're far enough away you </v>

2622
01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:06.550
<v Speaker 1>can just do an orbit like a planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the sun.</v>

2623
01:59:06.730 --> 01:59:11.730
<v Speaker 1>The Sun is attracting us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the earth doesn't fall into it and </v>

2624
01:59:11.730 --> 01:59:14.700
<v Speaker 1>not in a normal amount of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you anticipate that that's something </v>

2625
01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:18.151
<v Speaker 1>that we might try to do in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send a satellite into the black hole </v>

2626
01:59:18.151 --> 01:59:21.480
<v Speaker 1>first we'd have to find a black hole or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the one in the center of our galaxy </v>

2627
01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:21.480
<v Speaker 1>perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2628
01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.560
<v Speaker 1>that you know how long it takes to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this end of the golf is 40.</v>

2629
01:59:23.590 --> 01:59:25.660
<v Speaker 1>The center of our galaxy is 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>light years away,</v>

2630
01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:28.030
<v Speaker 1>so it's a long experiment.</v>

2631
01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate.</v>

2632
01:59:32.610 --> 01:59:35.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not clear to me the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>science foundation under trump or anyone</v>

2633
01:59:35.861 --> 01:59:37.840
<v Speaker 1>else is going gonna Fund that fund that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2634
01:59:38.010 --> 01:59:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Now what about having a week?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be interested if we could send a lot</v>

2635
01:59:40.331 --> 01:59:45.331
<v Speaker 1>of congress to explore what the what </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like at the center of the black </v>

2636
01:59:45.331 --> 01:59:45.640
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be a solution.</v>

2637
01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe suit them all up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2638
01:59:47.651 --> 01:59:52.651
<v Speaker 1>Sued 'em all up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go boldly go where no man or woman has </v>

2639
01:59:52.651 --> 01:59:55.531
<v Speaker 1>gone before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about black holes that are not </v>

2640
01:59:55.531 --> 01:59:56.170
<v Speaker 1>attached to galaxies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we don't see them,</v>

2641
01:59:57.160 --> 01:59:58.750
<v Speaker 1>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean right now we have.</v>

2642
01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:01.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe anyone's because here's </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you.</v>

2643
02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>How do you see a black hole?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to see the star circling </v>

2644
02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right.</v>

2645
02:00:06.540 --> 02:00:08.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way you can see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those just theoretical.</v>

2646
02:00:08.650 --> 02:00:11.330
<v Speaker 1>The stars that aren't the black holes </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather that aren't attached to.</v>

2647
02:00:11.650 --> 02:00:14.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean and not only are the theoretical,</v>

2648
02:00:14.201 --> 02:00:19.201
<v Speaker 1>I think very few people argue there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>many such things because we tend to </v>

2649
02:00:19.201 --> 02:00:23.641
<v Speaker 1>think that stars conglomerated around </v>
<v Speaker 1>around regions where there's dominant </v>

2650
02:00:23.641 --> 02:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2651
02:00:23.861 --> 02:00:28.861
<v Speaker 1>They collapsed and so while it's true </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the galaxies are just the tip of a </v>

2652
02:00:28.861 --> 02:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>dominant of a cosmic iceberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the massive galaxies isn't stars</v>

2653
02:00:32.650 --> 02:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>or black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this stuff called dark matter.</v>

2654
02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:38.630
<v Speaker 1>What is that stuff you can see and try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to explain it to me and told him,</v>

2655
02:00:38.650 --> 02:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>get in there either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2656
02:00:39.671 --> 02:00:44.671
<v Speaker 1>it's look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really quite simple when we way </v>

2657
02:00:44.671 --> 02:00:47.441
<v Speaker 1>galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we can do by seeing how fast the </v>

2658
02:00:47.441 --> 02:00:50.141
<v Speaker 1>stars move around them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find out that they weigh a lot more </v>

2659
02:00:50.141 --> 02:00:53.371
<v Speaker 1>than could be accounted by counting all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stars so the dominant mass doesn't </v>

2660
02:00:53.371 --> 02:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>shine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call that dark matter,</v>

2661
02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>not too surprising and what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we have discovered,</v>

2662
02:00:59.050 --> 02:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>and this is the surprising part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we can estimate how much normal </v>

2663
02:01:04.050 --> 02:01:07.681
<v Speaker 1>matter there is and by normal matter I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean the stuff made of protons and </v>

2664
02:01:07.681 --> 02:01:10.441
<v Speaker 1>neutrons the same as you and me and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we add up how much dark matter we see in</v>

2665
02:01:10.541 --> 02:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

2666
02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a heck of a lot more of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>than can be accounted for by the total </v>

2667
02:01:16.230 --> 02:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>number of protons and neutrons in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

2668
02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we think the dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter is made of some new type of </v>

2669
02:01:22.380 --> 02:01:25.171
<v Speaker 1>elementary particle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that was created in the early </v>

2670
02:01:25.171 --> 02:01:25.600
<v Speaker 1>history of the universe that's different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than normal matter.</v>

2671
02:01:26.560 --> 02:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>That's not too surprising either because</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early universe there was lots of </v>

2672
02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>energy around and if they're new </v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary particles that are stable,</v>

2673
02:01:31.841 --> 02:01:36.841
<v Speaker 1>it's not too surprising that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of them around and if they don't </v>

2674
02:01:36.841 --> 02:01:36.841
<v Speaker 1>interact with light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't see them.</v>

2675
02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is that reasonable,</v>

2676
02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>but we cannot understand how galaxies </v>
<v Speaker 1>would form.</v>

2677
02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>If it weren't for dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can do the calculations and show that</v>

2678
02:01:47.781 --> 02:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

2679
02:01:48.650 --> 02:01:53.650
<v Speaker 1>if there is a dark matter weren't made </v>
<v Speaker 1>of stuff that's different than protons </v>

2680
02:01:53.650 --> 02:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>and neutrons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would not have been enough time in</v>

2681
02:01:55.251 --> 02:01:57.950
<v Speaker 1>the history of the universe for galaxies</v>
<v Speaker 1>to form.</v>

2682
02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really strong evidence that that </v>

2683
02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:07.211
<v Speaker 1>stuff must be there and it must not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>made of protons and neutrons because </v>

2684
02:02:07.211 --> 02:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>we're proof.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You and I that galaxies formed.</v>

2685
02:02:09.020 --> 02:02:14.020
<v Speaker 1>It's so fascinating that there's this </v>
<v Speaker 1>element that's a huge part of the </v>

2686
02:02:14.020 --> 02:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>universe itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The word,</v>

2687
02:02:15.201 --> 02:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>not really exactly sure what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2688
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that great?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2689
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are mysteries.</v>

2690
02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>What unfortunately people get told is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it makes it seem like,</v>

2691
02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:26.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science was done and it's all done.</v>

2692
02:02:26.271 --> 02:02:28.070
<v Speaker 1>It was done by dead white men 200 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2693
02:02:28.071 --> 02:02:33.071
<v Speaker 1>That's not the mysteries continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's the greatest story ever </v>

2694
02:02:33.071 --> 02:02:36.941
<v Speaker 1>told so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why young kids should be </v>

2695
02:02:36.941 --> 02:02:39.011
<v Speaker 1>interested in science because life is </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of mysteries and we've learned so </v>

2696
02:02:39.011 --> 02:02:42.821
<v Speaker 1>much about the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gets more mysterious and more </v>

2697
02:02:42.821 --> 02:02:44.780
<v Speaker 1>exciting and every time we open a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>window on the universe were surprised.</v>

2698
02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>That's why we got to keep looking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not looking in.</v>

2699
02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about hyper Novas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyper Novas.</v>

2700
02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I watched a science documentary freaked </v>
<v Speaker 1>me out about how when they first started</v>

2701
02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:59.420
<v Speaker 1>measuring gamma ray bursts out into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unit.</v>

2702
02:02:59.421 --> 02:03:02.150
<v Speaker 1>They thought there was wars going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>between alien races.</v>

2703
02:03:02.210 --> 02:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point is that you know how you know </v>

2704
02:03:07.210 --> 02:03:07.280
<v Speaker 1>there are these things called gamma ray </v>
<v Speaker 1>bursts and what they are.</v>

2705
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Gamma rays are extremely energetic forms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of light if you want to think about it,</v>

2706
02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 1>and they're among other things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted in nuclear weapons explosions.</v>

2707
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2708
02:03:16.540 --> 02:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>and you know how they were discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really neat.</v>

2709
02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the few examples of defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

2710
02:03:22.041 --> 02:03:25.190
<v Speaker 1>well spent in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not the few,</v>

2711
02:03:25.191 --> 02:03:27.000
<v Speaker 1>but I now that you'll get lots of eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>mil.</v>

2712
02:03:27.001 --> 02:03:27.770
<v Speaker 1>So we'll like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

2713
02:03:28.030 --> 02:03:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there were these satellites that were</v>

2714
02:03:30.921 --> 02:03:35.060
<v Speaker 1>designed to go up that were earth </v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring to look for gamma rays.</v>

2715
02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause we were looking for nuclear </v>

2716
02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:40.880
<v Speaker 1>weapons explosions to see if the Soviets</v>
<v Speaker 1>or some other country where we're having</v>

2717
02:03:40.881 --> 02:03:43.040
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons closer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one way to monitor what year was</v>

2718
02:03:43.041 --> 02:03:43.730
<v Speaker 1>this one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2719
02:03:43.740 --> 02:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>this was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These satellites were put up in the </v>

2720
02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:49.130
<v Speaker 1>sixties and seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is around the time they did that</v>

2721
02:03:49.131 --> 02:03:51.660
<v Speaker 1>operation starfish prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they detonated in new,</v>

2722
02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:53.300
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the,</v>

2723
02:03:53.301 --> 02:03:54.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere.</v>

2724
02:03:54.711 --> 02:03:56.690
<v Speaker 1>The magnetosphere probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2725
02:03:56.750 --> 02:03:58.640
<v Speaker 1>but I honestly don't know the answer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that question,</v>

2726
02:03:58.641 --> 02:04:03.641
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is they were used by the </v>

2727
02:04:03.641 --> 02:04:04.340
<v Speaker 1>as monitoring systems to look for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons explosions.</v>

2728
02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>And then these things are sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking downward discover these,</v>

2729
02:04:07.941 --> 02:04:12.941
<v Speaker 1>get these short bursts of gamma rays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be a potential signature of </v>

2730
02:04:12.941 --> 02:04:17.291
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they discovered they weren't coming </v>

2731
02:04:17.291 --> 02:04:19.991
<v Speaker 1>from earth and then they discovered they</v>
<v Speaker 1>were coming from everywhere in the </v>

2732
02:04:19.991 --> 02:04:21.200
<v Speaker 1>cosmos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how they were discovered.</v>

2733
02:04:21.230 --> 02:04:23.030
<v Speaker 1>These devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're monitoring the earth,</v>

2734
02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:26.450
<v Speaker 1>looking for nuclear weapons explosions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then saw them out in space.</v>

2735
02:04:26.451 --> 02:04:29.090
<v Speaker 1>How many of them were well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're everywhere.</v>

2736
02:04:29.100 --> 02:04:31.340
<v Speaker 1>There's millions of them and they happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2737
02:04:31.341 --> 02:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>One second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two second,</v>

2738
02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.330
<v Speaker 1>one minute long bursts that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly energetic.</v>

2739
02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:38.520
<v Speaker 1>It meaning more energy than Sun may meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this lifetime,</v>

2740
02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>in its lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're happening all the time.</v>

2741
02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>They're happening all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

2742
02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Because the great thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

2743
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:49.500
<v Speaker 1>it's big and it's old and therefore a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare events happen all the time.</v>

2744
02:04:49.501 --> 02:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stars explode and it's good for us.</v>

2745
02:04:53.571 --> 02:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>It starts exploding about in this book </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it it's it.</v>

2746
02:04:57.100 --> 02:05:02.100
<v Speaker 1>Because every atom in your body and </v>
<v Speaker 1>every atom in my body was made inside </v>

2747
02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:02.450
<v Speaker 1>stars that eventually explode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2748
02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:05.070
<v Speaker 1>how do we know that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in the big bang,</v>

2749
02:05:05.071 --> 02:05:06.990
<v Speaker 1>the only elements that were created were</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen,</v>

2750
02:05:07.230 --> 02:05:08.670
<v Speaker 1>helium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a little bit of lithium.</v>

2751
02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the importance for some people,</v>

2752
02:05:10.991 --> 02:05:12.230
<v Speaker 1>that seems important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest of us,</v>

2753
02:05:13.110 --> 02:05:14.040
<v Speaker 1>rest of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon,</v>

2754
02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen,</v>

2755
02:05:15.421 --> 02:05:20.421
<v Speaker 1>iron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the stuff that makes us human was </v>

2756
02:05:20.421 --> 02:05:21.510
<v Speaker 1>only created in the fiery furnaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the cores of stars.</v>

2757
02:05:22.110 --> 02:05:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And how could it get into your and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>body?</v>

2758
02:05:23.950 --> 02:05:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Because there were stars that were kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to explode.</v>

2759
02:05:26.340 --> 02:05:28.590
<v Speaker 1>So as I once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some people put on t shirts now,</v>

2760
02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:30.510
<v Speaker 1>so forget Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The stars died.</v>

2761
02:05:30.511 --> 02:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>So we could be born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2762
02:05:32.070 --> 02:05:33.480
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here's the deal.</v>

2763
02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Stars explode about once every hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>years per galaxy.</v>

2764
02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:43.040
<v Speaker 1>So in our galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once every hundred years to stars </v>

2765
02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:45.591
<v Speaker 1>explodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been about 200 million stars </v>

2766
02:05:45.591 --> 02:05:48.141
<v Speaker 1>explode in the 14 billion years or 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years since our galaxy has been </v>

2767
02:05:48.141 --> 02:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's produced the raw materials at</v>

2768
02:05:49.351 --> 02:05:54.351
<v Speaker 1>four and a half billion years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coalesce to form our sun and the </v>

2769
02:05:54.351 --> 02:05:54.351
<v Speaker 1>planets.</v>

2770
02:05:54.351 --> 02:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>And you and I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the atoms in your body Balms,</v>

2771
02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:00.820
<v Speaker 1>restores and been through the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense explosion that we know of in </v>

2772
02:06:00.820 --> 02:06:04.251
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A supernova and every atom in your body </v>

2773
02:06:04.251 --> 02:06:05.640
<v Speaker 1>is experiencing maybe more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because to get to the amount of carbon,</v>

2774
02:06:05.641 --> 02:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen,</v>

2775
02:06:06.501 --> 02:06:09.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's in our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had to be recycled many times.</v>

2776
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>So the Adams in your left hand may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been inside a different star than your </v>

2777
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really star dust.</v>

2778
02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:18.901
<v Speaker 1>We're all stardust where we're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected the cosmos in really </v>

2779
02:06:18.901 --> 02:06:21.750
<v Speaker 1>interesting and important ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We literally were created by stars.</v>

2780
02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:22.920
<v Speaker 1>That's great thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2781
02:06:22.940 --> 02:06:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the point I wanted to </v>

2782
02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:29.451
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point I wanted to make was stars </v>

2783
02:06:29.451 --> 02:06:30.330
<v Speaker 1>explode once for a hundred years per </v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxy.</v>

2784
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:33.690
<v Speaker 1>We use supernovae as a way to probe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

2785
02:06:34.110 --> 02:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>How can we do that if one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're looking at galaxies and one </v>

2786
02:06:39.110 --> 02:06:39.870
<v Speaker 1>star explodes every hundred years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the galaxy,</v>

2787
02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:41.270
<v Speaker 1>how can we use them as probes?</v>

2788
02:06:41.300 --> 02:06:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>

2789
02:06:41.971 --> 02:06:44.880
<v Speaker 1>there's one way is to sign a graduate </v>
<v Speaker 1>student teach galaxy.</v>

2790
02:06:45.390 --> 02:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phd period can be about a hundred </v>

2791
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>years and if they die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>students are cheap.</v>

2792
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:54.531
<v Speaker 1>So you get a new one or we use a nomad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fact that the universe is big and </v>

2793
02:06:54.531 --> 02:06:58.881
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take your hands up tonight and </v>

2794
02:06:58.881 --> 02:07:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and we're in Los Angeles where you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the stars and it held a dime sized,</v>

2795
02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>made a dime sized hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and looked up at a dime size dark region</v>

2796
02:07:05.461 --> 02:07:06.750
<v Speaker 1>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

2797
02:07:06.751 --> 02:07:11.751
<v Speaker 1>You didn't see any stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a telescope that as big as </v>

2798
02:07:11.751 --> 02:07:13.080
<v Speaker 1>the telescope in Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd see 100,000</v>

2799
02:07:13.081 --> 02:07:15.510
<v Speaker 1>galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>

2800
02:07:15.511 --> 02:07:20.511
<v Speaker 1>galaxies and that small region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then if one star explodes every hundred </v>

2801
02:07:20.511 --> 02:07:21.520
<v Speaker 1>years per galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you work out,</v>

2802
02:07:21.660 --> 02:07:23.580
<v Speaker 1>how many stars will I see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Explode tonight?</v>

2803
02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>You'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see two or three stars explode </v>

2804
02:07:29.150 --> 02:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>just in that dime.</v>

2805
02:07:29.150 --> 02:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>Size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2806
02:07:29.150 --> 02:07:33.170
<v Speaker 1>because the universe is big and old and </v>
<v Speaker 1>rare events happen all the time and </v>

2807
02:07:33.170 --> 02:07:38.151
<v Speaker 1>that's what makes the universe so </v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting because now we can use </v>

2808
02:07:38.151 --> 02:07:39.310
<v Speaker 1>supernova to study the universe because </v>
<v Speaker 1>astronomers write proposals and say,</v>

2809
02:07:39.311 --> 02:07:41.920
<v Speaker 1>tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean use the Hubble space telescope to</v>

2810
02:07:41.921 --> 02:07:44.110
<v Speaker 1>look at this region and I'm going to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>three stars explode.</v>

2811
02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that amazing?</v>

2812
02:07:46.150 --> 02:07:47.310
<v Speaker 1>That is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2813
02:07:47.410 --> 02:07:52.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And isn't it a shame that more people </v>

2814
02:07:52.410 --> 02:07:53.170
<v Speaker 1>don't realize that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's as amazing as you know,</v>

2815
02:07:53.171 --> 02:07:54.340
<v Speaker 1>as anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2816
02:07:54.341 --> 02:07:55.840
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of thing that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2817
02:07:55.841 --> 02:07:57.930
<v Speaker 1>oh wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2818
02:07:58.270 --> 02:07:59.350
<v Speaker 1>that's neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

2819
02:07:59.351 --> 02:08:01.930
<v Speaker 1>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's neat to see a great movie too,</v>

2820
02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:07.350
<v Speaker 1>but that they're all together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science is fun and Neat and interesting </v>

2821
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.840
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have to be a scientist to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find it.</v>

2822
02:08:07.841 --> 02:08:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2823
02:08:09.460 --> 02:08:11.350
<v Speaker 1>That is about as amazing as it gets.</v>

2824
02:08:11.530 --> 02:08:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I think we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a real issue.</v>

2825
02:08:13.451 --> 02:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I think with cities were light pollution</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevents people from seeing your amazing</v>

2826
02:08:17.700 --> 02:08:18.360
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2827
02:08:18.370 --> 02:08:20.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of astronomers who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are doing,</v>

2828
02:08:20.291 --> 02:08:25.291
<v Speaker 1>in fact I'm active work to try and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce light pollution in cities near </v>

2829
02:08:25.481 --> 02:08:27.160
<v Speaker 1>telescopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's other.</v>

2830
02:08:27.190 --> 02:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accuracy,</v>

2831
02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>but radio telescope is an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've never been down to Puerto </v>

2832
02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's beautiful.</v>

2833
02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:37.321
<v Speaker 1>It was actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have seen it in to James Bond </v>

2834
02:08:37.321 --> 02:08:37.321
<v Speaker 1>movies because they made it into like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the layer of,</v>

2835
02:08:37.321 --> 02:08:37.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2836
02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:39.150
<v Speaker 1>the pictures of it in the layer of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2837
02:08:39.151 --> 02:08:43.510
<v Speaker 1>of some crazy evil scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been there a few times and it's</v>

2838
02:08:43.511 --> 02:08:46.840
<v Speaker 1>amazing because it's this thousand meter</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide net of,</v>

2839
02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:47.860
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2840
02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:52.920
<v Speaker 1>of wires in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a natural sort of volcanic volcanic </v>

2841
02:08:52.961 --> 02:08:54.280
<v Speaker 1>cap account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really beautiful.</v>

2842
02:08:54.610 --> 02:08:56.230
<v Speaker 1>And there's jungle growing underneath </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2843
02:08:56.350 --> 02:09:01.350
<v Speaker 1>I'd walked underneath it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the receivables Pedro scope is </v>

2844
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.350
<v Speaker 1>amazing because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2845
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:05.620
<v Speaker 1>it because it's so big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it allows us to measure lots of neat </v>

2846
02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:05.620
<v Speaker 1>things in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

2847
02:09:05.620 --> 02:09:08.200
<v Speaker 1>you could measure a light bulb on Pluto </v>
<v Speaker 1>if there was a light bulb.</v>

2848
02:09:08.220 --> 02:09:09.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at the picture of it now.</v>

2849
02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:11.830
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

2850
02:09:11.831 --> 02:09:14.650
<v Speaker 1>And you can't even get the sense of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>size of it necessarily from that.</v>

2851
02:09:14.980 --> 02:09:16.450
<v Speaker 1>It's all wired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's all wires.</v>

2852
02:09:16.451 --> 02:09:21.451
<v Speaker 1>It's not solid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wires because it's only measuring </v>

2853
02:09:21.451 --> 02:09:23.551
<v Speaker 1>radio waves if the wavelength is large </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the spacing between the </v>

2854
02:09:23.551 --> 02:09:23.920
<v Speaker 1>wires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't need something solid.</v>

2855
02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2856
02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:26.820
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2857
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:32.520
<v Speaker 1>they were worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a real example they're </v>

2858
02:09:32.520 --> 02:09:32.520
<v Speaker 1>looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>

2859
02:09:32.650 --> 02:09:37.650
<v Speaker 1>a frequency of radiation which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitous in the universe that is </v>

2860
02:09:37.650 --> 02:09:41.251
<v Speaker 1>emitted by hydrogen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first sort of thing that </v>

2861
02:09:41.251 --> 02:09:41.251
<v Speaker 1>people used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>

2862
02:09:41.251 --> 02:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>radio astronomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen Mitsa a has a characteristic </v>

2863
02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:49.441
<v Speaker 1>frequency of emission of radio waves due</v>
<v Speaker 1>to due to what's called the high </v>

2864
02:09:49.441 --> 02:09:49.630
<v Speaker 1>performance building and hydrogen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2865
02:09:49.640 --> 02:09:49.930
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2866
02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And so people have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

2867
02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:57.060
<v Speaker 1>that would be a wonderful frequency for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for aliens to commute if they really </v>

2868
02:09:57.060 --> 02:10:00.310
<v Speaker 1>wanted to show it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're smart enough to know that how</v>

2869
02:10:00.311 --> 02:10:02.410
<v Speaker 1>the universe works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a universal frequency.</v>

2870
02:10:02.411 --> 02:10:05.950
<v Speaker 1>That's everywhere because hydrogen is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant kind of matter and it all,</v>

2871
02:10:06.010 --> 02:10:08.170
<v Speaker 1>it always emits radiation at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency.</v>

2872
02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A thousand 40 megahertz I think is the </v>

2873
02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:13.280
<v Speaker 1>frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2874
02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:15.140
<v Speaker 1>A yellow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2875
02:10:15.141 --> 02:10:16.810
<v Speaker 1>it could be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something like that.</v>

2876
02:10:17.110 --> 02:10:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're worried because there was </v>

2877
02:10:22.110 --> 02:10:25.320
<v Speaker 1>nearby are stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was an evangelist who had a huge </v>

2878
02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:29.671
<v Speaker 1>radio station and wanted to broadcast to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the continental United States is </v>

2879
02:10:29.671 --> 02:10:34.200
<v Speaker 1>evangelical message and he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically at a frequency that would mean</v>

2880
02:10:35.031 --> 02:10:38.270
<v Speaker 1>that she couldn't work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of light pollution,</v>

2881
02:10:38.420 --> 02:10:40.280
<v Speaker 1>we talked about light pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was radio pollution.</v>

2882
02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pollution in many ways because </v>

2883
02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:45.760
<v Speaker 1>everything you said was polluting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2884
02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:45.760
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2885
02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2886
02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:47.480
<v Speaker 1>and finally they managed to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fix that,</v>

2887
02:10:47.481 --> 02:10:52.481
<v Speaker 1>but there would have been one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most amazing windows on the universe </v>

2888
02:10:52.481 --> 02:10:54.650
<v Speaker 1>that would have been blocked out by </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio light,</v>

2889
02:10:54.710 --> 02:10:55.940
<v Speaker 1>just like from an evangelists.</v>

2890
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:56.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2891
02:10:56.530 --> 02:10:57.890
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it,</v>

2892
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:59.120
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very ironic.</v>

2893
02:10:59.150 --> 02:11:04.150
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very symbolic of many </v>

2894
02:11:04.150 --> 02:11:04.150
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2895
02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:07.400
<v Speaker 1>That is fascinating moment of silence </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's so amazing.</v>

2896
02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2897
02:11:07.851 --> 02:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>it's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2898
02:11:09.441 --> 02:11:10.130
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's okay.</v>

2899
02:11:10.131 --> 02:11:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Being confused is that I told you being </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

2900
02:11:12.951 --> 02:11:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Confused is the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2901
02:11:14.830 --> 02:11:18.230
<v Speaker 1>that I and I can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it now.</v>

2902
02:11:18.231 --> 02:11:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2903
02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:23.880
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about the vastness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>space and you talk about space being 14 </v>

2904
02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:29.390
<v Speaker 1>billion or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>point 8 billion years old plus or minus </v>

2905
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:32.561
<v Speaker 1>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the going theory about what was </v>

2906
02:11:32.561 --> 02:11:35.090
<v Speaker 1>going on before that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I wrote a book about it,</v>

2907
02:11:35.091 --> 02:11:36.080
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2908
02:11:36.110 --> 02:11:36.710
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2909
02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:39.160
<v Speaker 1>called the universe from nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is we don't.</v>

2910
02:11:39.190 --> 02:11:44.190
<v Speaker 1>The simple answer is we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>because the at the incident of the Big </v>

2911
02:11:44.190 --> 02:11:48.461
<v Speaker 1>Bang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole universe was contained in a </v>

2912
02:11:48.461 --> 02:11:50.741
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to understand gravity is a </v>

2913
02:11:50.741 --> 02:11:54.071
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanical forest to really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what was happening and we </v>

2914
02:11:54.071 --> 02:11:54.920
<v Speaker 1>don't have a quantum theory of gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's okay to say we don't know,</v>

2915
02:11:55.040 --> 02:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>but we can say what plausibly was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case and one possibility and the </v>

2916
02:12:00.040 --> 02:12:04.331
<v Speaker 1>possibility that looks most plausible </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I talked about is our universe </v>

2917
02:12:04.331 --> 02:12:07.310
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously came into being from </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing by quantum fluctuations,</v>

2918
02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:09.380
<v Speaker 1>a space and time that did not exist.</v>

2919
02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So our space and our time didn't exist </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was no matter in the universe </v>

2920
02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's suddenly popped into existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the neat things is if you add</v>

2921
02:12:17.301 --> 02:12:19.490
<v Speaker 1>up the total energy of all the stuff on </v>
<v Speaker 1>our universe,</v>

2922
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:22.400
<v Speaker 1>it adds up to zero as far as we can tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2923
02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that,</v>

2924
02:12:23.790 --> 02:12:24.850
<v Speaker 1>how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it.</v>

2925
02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Because gravity allows things to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive energy as well as negative </v>

2926
02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:30.080
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You add it all up and our universe looks</v>

2927
02:12:30.081 --> 02:12:32.600
<v Speaker 1>like in its total energy zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know you're shaking your head,</v>

2928
02:12:32.601 --> 02:12:34.100
<v Speaker 1>but that's the neat thing is I'm trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2929
02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:37.100
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to create a universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>from nothing,</v>

2930
02:12:37.550 --> 02:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>what would you make?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The total energy,</v>

2931
02:12:39.130 --> 02:12:41.600
<v Speaker 1>the total energy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you?</v>

2932
02:12:41.660 --> 02:12:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Once you realize the total energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe can be zero,</v>

2933
02:12:44.780 --> 02:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>then the possibility that it comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing becomes plausible because if it </v>

2934
02:12:49.780 --> 02:12:50.840
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may need to dd to create everything,</v>

2935
02:12:51.260 --> 02:12:56.260
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out you can create a 100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion galaxies each containing 100 </v>

2936
02:12:56.260 --> 02:12:58.370
<v Speaker 1>billion stars without violating energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservation,</v>

2937
02:12:59.870 --> 02:13:00.610
<v Speaker 1>and that isn't it.</v>

2938
02:13:00.620 --> 02:13:02.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the ultimate free lunches Alan guth</v>
<v Speaker 1>would say,</v>

2939
02:13:02.910 --> 02:13:05.720
<v Speaker 1>and it's amazing that that's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

2940
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:07.490
<v Speaker 1>can we prove that that happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2941
02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but everything we can point to makes it </v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible.</v>

2942
02:13:10.311 --> 02:13:11.870
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can ask the following question.</v>

2943
02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:17.440
<v Speaker 1>What would the universe look like today </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was created that that that arose </v>

2944
02:13:18.411 --> 02:13:23.411
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously from nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 point 8 billion years ago just by </v>

2945
02:13:24.381 --> 02:13:27.440
<v Speaker 1>known laws of physics or at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible laws of physics.</v>

2946
02:13:27.650 --> 02:13:29.900
<v Speaker 1>What would it look like today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that,</v>

2947
02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:34.960
<v Speaker 1>if that was the requirement and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer is it will look just like the </v>

2948
02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:37.821
<v Speaker 1>universe in which we live in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that prove that that's what </v>

2949
02:13:37.821 --> 02:13:37.821
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2950
02:13:37.821 --> 02:13:41.661
<v Speaker 1>but it makes it plausible and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>it plausible without supernatural </v>

2951
02:13:41.661 --> 02:13:42.630
<v Speaker 1>shenanigans and anytime you can get rid </v>
<v Speaker 1>of God,</v>

2952
02:13:42.631 --> 02:13:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't something out of nothing.</v>

2953
02:13:44.881 --> 02:13:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Supernatural Shenanigans because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens all the time.</v>

2954
02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2955
02:13:48.741 --> 02:13:49.080
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2956
02:13:49.110 --> 02:13:51.720
<v Speaker 1>this is an example I've been talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to a few times today to people.</v>

2957
02:13:51.960 --> 02:13:55.740
<v Speaker 1>The lights in the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lights above us,</v>

2958
02:13:55.800 --> 02:13:57.600
<v Speaker 1>our head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happened?</v>

2959
02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:02.280
<v Speaker 1>So electrons change energy levels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Adams and they emit photons were,</v>

2960
02:14:02.300 --> 02:14:03.810
<v Speaker 1>were the photons before they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted,</v>

2961
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:06.670
<v Speaker 1>they weren't in the Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where were they?</v>

2962
02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:08.010
<v Speaker 1>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't exist.</v>

2963
02:14:08.011 --> 02:14:13.011
<v Speaker 1>They were spontaneously graded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were turned on by the lights </v>

2964
02:14:13.011 --> 02:14:13.011
<v Speaker 1>switch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2965
02:14:13.011 --> 02:14:13.011
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2966
02:14:13.011 --> 02:14:15.390
<v Speaker 1>They're spontaneously created because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no cause for any of them to.</v>

2967
02:14:15.810 --> 02:14:20.810
<v Speaker 1>Each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam spontaneously decays into a </v>

2968
02:14:20.810 --> 02:14:23.181
<v Speaker 1>different level because quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics says that these things can </v>

2969
02:14:23.181 --> 02:14:23.181
<v Speaker 1>happen spontaneously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it does,</v>

2970
02:14:23.181 --> 02:14:25.830
<v Speaker 1>a photon is created from nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what I was getting at.</v>

2971
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:31.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference between this </v>

2972
02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:33.351
<v Speaker 1>infinitely dent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small point that the universe came out </v>

2973
02:14:33.351 --> 02:14:33.780
<v Speaker 1>of and the center of a black hole.</v>

2974
02:14:33.780 --> 02:14:36.660
<v Speaker 1>The event horizon of a black hole?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2975
02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:40.320
<v Speaker 1>another event horizon isn't the center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the outside of the black hole.</v>

2976
02:14:40.410 --> 02:14:40.980
<v Speaker 1>The will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

2977
02:14:40.981 --> 02:14:43.350
<v Speaker 1>the answer is there is no different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No different.</v>

2978
02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:48.380
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're singularities where the laws of </v>

2979
02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:48.380
<v Speaker 1>physics as we know them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>break down.</v>

2980
02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that inside of each one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those black holes is the birth of the</v>

2981
02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:52.140
<v Speaker 1>universe maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that how we were?</v>

2982
02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:53.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2983
02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more likely to.</v>

2984
02:14:54.841 --> 02:14:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Quantum mechanics just burped us out per</v>
<v Speaker 1>cosmic burp.</v>

2985
02:14:58.650 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 1>Much like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2986
02:14:59.341 --> 02:15:01.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you saw in my,</v>

2987
02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.900
<v Speaker 1>in my jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I don't know where I put it,</v>

2988
02:15:03.901 --> 02:15:06.440
<v Speaker 1>but it was probably outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2989
02:15:06.441 --> 02:15:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I had the flying spaghetti monster </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I love this because he boiled so</v>

2990
02:15:11.101 --> 02:15:12.880
<v Speaker 1>that we could be alive today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

2991
02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:14.480
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2992
02:15:14.750 --> 02:15:15.590
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2993
02:15:15.610 --> 02:15:18.610
<v Speaker 1>it's just pissing people off me.</v>

2994
02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:27.360
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this infinitely dense point of 13 </v>

2995
02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:28.890
<v Speaker 1>point 8 billion years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was whatever it was,</v>

2996
02:15:28.891 --> 02:15:33.891
<v Speaker 1>is this something out of nothing point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts about before </v>

2997
02:15:33.891 --> 02:15:33.891
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2998
02:15:33.891 --> 02:15:37.410
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>hate one possibility,</v>

2999
02:15:37.411 --> 02:15:42.411
<v Speaker 1>which is quite possible and plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If our space suddenly popped out or </v>

3000
02:15:42.411 --> 02:15:47.271
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein tells us that space and time </v>

3001
02:15:47.271 --> 02:15:47.870
<v Speaker 1>are together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a four dimension universe.</v>

3002
02:15:48.090 --> 02:15:50.580
<v Speaker 1>So space began at that instance sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3003
02:15:51.330 --> 02:15:54.210
<v Speaker 1>So there was no before the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a good question.</v>

3004
02:15:54.600 --> 02:15:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Tom didn't exist to the universe came </v>
<v Speaker 1>into existence.</v>

3005
02:15:57.000 --> 02:16:00.150
<v Speaker 1>So to ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was before is not a good question.</v>

3006
02:16:00.420 --> 02:16:03.270
<v Speaker 1>So time didn't exist before 13 point 8 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion years.</v>

3007
02:16:03.271 --> 02:16:06.600
<v Speaker 1>It could be that if our university is </v>
<v Speaker 1>all there is and that we happen to think</v>

3008
02:16:06.601 --> 02:16:11.601
<v Speaker 1>by the way is not likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it is then it doesn't make sense </v>

3009
02:16:11.601 --> 02:16:13.920
<v Speaker 1>to ask the question what was before </v>
<v Speaker 1>because Tom didn't exist.</v>

3010
02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:16.440
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a cop out and it Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

3011
02:16:16.770 --> 02:16:18.590
<v Speaker 1>but it may also be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

3012
02:16:19.190 --> 02:16:24.190
<v Speaker 1>And if there's no before then all of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>notions of causality go out the window </v>

3013
02:16:24.190 --> 02:16:25.680
<v Speaker 1>because we all depend on but before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>after to decide causes and effects.</v>

3014
02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:30.800
<v Speaker 1>But if there was no before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we have to change our notions of a </v>

3015
02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:30.800
<v Speaker 1>cause and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's awful.</v>

3016
02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:32.080
<v Speaker 1>But Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we call learning.</v>

3017
02:16:32.770 --> 02:16:35.980
<v Speaker 1>What about the idea is that the universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in a constant state of contraction?</v>

3018
02:16:35.981 --> 02:16:36.490
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't.</v>

3019
02:16:36.700 --> 02:16:39.640
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean some people think that no,</v>

3020
02:16:39.670 --> 02:16:44.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not been abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some physicists will argue that there's </v>

3021
02:16:44.670 --> 02:16:44.770
<v Speaker 1>a cycle because it looks nice and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't.</v>

3022
02:16:45.070 --> 02:16:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I think most of most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's some people who are </v>

3023
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.590
<v Speaker 1>arguing for that pitch something neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3024
02:16:50.591 --> 02:16:55.591
<v Speaker 1>I think they're trying to type their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignorance in something that isn't any </v>

3025
02:16:55.591 --> 02:16:56.170
<v Speaker 1>more plausible than the picture that </v>
<v Speaker 1>expands forever.</v>

3026
02:16:56.520 --> 02:17:01.520
<v Speaker 1>And as far as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most likely possibilities that our </v>

3027
02:17:01.520 --> 02:17:02.950
<v Speaker 1>university will expand forever fought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make you a little bit happier.</v>

3028
02:17:03.350 --> 02:17:06.910
<v Speaker 1>It's quite possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best pictures that we have of our,</v>

3029
02:17:06.930 --> 02:17:07.390
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

3030
02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:09.930
<v Speaker 1>of the early years is that we actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>are universities.</v>

3031
02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Unique isn't alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are many universes,</v>

3032
02:17:12.970 --> 02:17:17.970
<v Speaker 1>we call it a multiverse and that at any </v>
<v Speaker 1>instant in time and kind of a cosmic </v>

3033
02:17:18.280 --> 02:17:23.280
<v Speaker 1>super time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always university being born so </v>

3034
02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:25.390
<v Speaker 1>that that multi-verse might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be infinite and eternal.</v>

3035
02:17:25.450 --> 02:17:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Where are they outside of our universe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3036
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:28.830
<v Speaker 1>how's that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even possible.</v>

3037
02:17:28.831 --> 02:17:29.860
<v Speaker 1>How?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's possible.</v>

3038
02:17:29.890 --> 02:17:32.070
<v Speaker 1>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3039
02:17:32.100 --> 02:17:32.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3040
02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:34.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3041
02:17:34.660 --> 02:17:39.660
<v Speaker 1>the simplest possibility is that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the region we can see right for,</v>

3042
02:17:39.840 --> 02:17:40.870
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3043
02:17:40.871 --> 02:17:45.871
<v Speaker 1>the edges of our visible universe space </v>
<v Speaker 1>is expanding faster away from us than </v>

3044
02:17:45.871 --> 02:17:47.760
<v Speaker 1>light because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we taught you in school.</v>

3045
02:17:47.780 --> 02:17:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can travel faster than light and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may remember that we lied.</v>

3046
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

3047
02:17:52.570 --> 02:17:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to parse it more carefully.</v>

3048
02:17:54.401 --> 02:17:59.401
<v Speaker 1>Like a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing can travel through space faster </v>

3049
02:17:59.401 --> 02:18:02.371
<v Speaker 1>than light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but space can do whatever the hell it </v>

3050
02:18:02.371 --> 02:18:02.371
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So locally,</v>

3051
02:18:02.371 --> 02:18:03.160
<v Speaker 1>as I told you though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radio host is,</v>

3052
02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:08.380
<v Speaker 1>is at rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not moving and the other end of </v>

3053
02:18:08.380 --> 02:18:08.620
<v Speaker 1>the galaxy at the other end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>visible universe and we're at rest,</v>

3054
02:18:08.800 --> 02:18:12.040
<v Speaker 1>but the space between us is expanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that galaxy,</v>

3055
02:18:12.041 --> 02:18:17.041
<v Speaker 1>like a surfer is being carried away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>us faster than light relative to the </v>

3056
02:18:17.041 --> 02:18:19.390
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The surfer isn't moving right,</v>

3057
02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:22.420
<v Speaker 1>but relative to the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the surfer is right,</v>

3058
02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:23.470
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3059
02:18:23.710 --> 02:18:28.710
<v Speaker 1>So this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this galaxy is not moving relative to </v>

3060
02:18:28.710 --> 02:18:30.340
<v Speaker 1>its local surroundings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's moving away from us faster than</v>

3061
02:18:30.341 --> 02:18:32.500
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like a surfer in an undertow,</v>

3062
02:18:32.890 --> 02:18:37.890
<v Speaker 1>they can swim really fast in the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the water's moving away from the </v>

3063
02:18:37.890 --> 02:18:40.981
<v Speaker 1>shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll let me take it back to the </v>

3064
02:18:40.981 --> 02:18:40.981
<v Speaker 1>shore.</v>

3065
02:18:40.981 --> 02:18:40.981
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that galaxy,</v>

3066
02:18:40.981 --> 02:18:43.240
<v Speaker 1>the light from that galaxy is traveling </v>
<v Speaker 1>through space at the speed of light,</v>

3067
02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:46.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's the space in between us and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies moving faster than light.</v>

3068
02:18:46.630 --> 02:18:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Then the poor like can never make it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

3069
02:18:48.970 --> 02:18:52.270
<v Speaker 1>We call that a horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3070
02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:57.390
<v Speaker 1>So the space is traveling too far for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the light to reach us so fast.</v>

3071
02:18:58.610 --> 02:19:03.610
<v Speaker 1>The two spaces too fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the light can't catch up with the </v>

3072
02:19:03.610 --> 02:19:06.781
<v Speaker 1>expansion of space and it never gets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>us and that that galaxy disappears from </v>

3073
02:19:07.691 --> 02:19:11.590
<v Speaker 1>our causal horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call it will never be able to see.</v>

3074
02:19:11.591 --> 02:19:16.591
<v Speaker 1>It will never be able to interact with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will never be okay and it could be </v>

3075
02:19:16.591 --> 02:19:19.180
<v Speaker 1>that that there are different regions so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far away from us.</v>

3076
02:19:19.570 --> 02:19:21.610
<v Speaker 1>We're space is expanding faster than </v>
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>

3077
02:19:21.910 --> 02:19:25.300
<v Speaker 1>which which have a very different </v>
<v Speaker 1>history than our own,</v>

3078
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:28.220
<v Speaker 1>so there could be space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be infinite,</v>

3079
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:33.250
<v Speaker 1>just our simple unit space that we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>of and love could be infinite in extent </v>

3080
02:19:33.350 --> 02:19:38.350
<v Speaker 1>and different regions of that space had </v>
<v Speaker 1>different histories and some of those </v>

3081
02:19:38.350 --> 02:19:38.350
<v Speaker 1>regions.</v>

3082
02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Everything we can see we know emerged </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a single point.</v>

3083
02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:43.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can tell that.</v>

3084
02:19:43.850 --> 02:19:48.850
<v Speaker 1>We can tell that by measuring the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>bang expansion of everything we see and </v>

3085
02:19:48.850 --> 02:19:51.971
<v Speaker 1>working backwards and the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>that our visible universe was once </v>

3086
02:19:51.971 --> 02:19:52.640
<v Speaker 1>smaller and smaller and smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back in time,</v>

3087
02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:57.820
<v Speaker 1>we can actually follow the laws of </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics back to the earliest moments of </v>

3088
02:19:57.820 --> 02:20:00.881
<v Speaker 1>the big bang until those laws break down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can make predictions about the </v>

3089
02:20:00.881 --> 02:20:01.700
<v Speaker 1>university would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those predictions agree exactly what</v>

3090
02:20:01.701 --> 02:20:04.400
<v Speaker 1>the observations we make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tell us that that picture works,</v>

3091
02:20:04.580 --> 02:20:06.260
<v Speaker 1>but another region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wish,</v>

3092
02:20:06.261 --> 02:20:07.670
<v Speaker 1>could have come from a different big </v>
<v Speaker 1>bang,</v>

3093
02:20:08.390 --> 02:20:11.060
<v Speaker 1>but is that another universe or is it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the university?</v>

3094
02:20:11.070 --> 02:20:16.070
<v Speaker 1>We see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's how we've changed and this is </v>

3095
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.070
<v Speaker 1>semantics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nontrivial semantics,</v>

3096
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:19.680
<v Speaker 1>namely when I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe meant everything.</v>

3097
02:20:19.700 --> 02:20:24.700
<v Speaker 1>Everything right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we say that's it's pretty stupid </v>

3098
02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:26.981
<v Speaker 1>definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A better definition is an operational </v>

3099
02:20:26.981 --> 02:20:28.700
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Universe means that region of space with</v>

3100
02:20:28.701 --> 02:20:33.701
<v Speaker 1>which at one time we could have </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicated or one time in the future </v>

3101
02:20:33.701 --> 02:20:38.501
<v Speaker 1>even if the future is infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might communicate with because that </v>

3102
02:20:38.501 --> 02:20:42.461
<v Speaker 1>describes the region of space we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>causing effect works some measurable </v>

3103
02:20:42.531 --> 02:20:43.580
<v Speaker 1>distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3104
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:48.790
<v Speaker 1>and so that art we think of the universe</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that region which could throughout </v>

3105
02:20:48.790 --> 02:20:53.170
<v Speaker 1>which everything could affect everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else ultimately in an infinitely long </v>

3106
02:20:53.170 --> 02:20:57.011
<v Speaker 1>time and in that picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universes can be restricted in size and </v>

3107
02:20:59.451 --> 02:21:04.451
<v Speaker 1>then other regions which could never </v>
<v Speaker 1>have affected us and which will never </v>

3108
02:21:04.451 --> 02:21:08.111
<v Speaker 1>affect us in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call other universes a and when and </v>

3109
02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:10.460
<v Speaker 1>now there are many different versions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a multiverse,</v>

3110
02:21:10.670 --> 02:21:14.450
<v Speaker 1>but that's the simplest version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this picture we call inflation,</v>

3111
02:21:15.230 --> 02:21:15.830
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3112
02:21:15.970 --> 02:21:16.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk,</v>

3113
02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:19.460
<v Speaker 1>I just did two little clips associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the new book,</v>

3114
02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:23.930
<v Speaker 1>one for us for a publisher and one was </v>
<v Speaker 1>for big think one is a,</v>

3115
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:26.420
<v Speaker 1>the universe and under two minutes so </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look up online,</v>

3116
02:21:26.421 --> 02:21:31.421
<v Speaker 1>looked for Lawrence Krauss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explains the universe in under two </v>

3117
02:21:31.421 --> 02:21:33.161
<v Speaker 1>minutes where I talk about this cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion and how it might mean there's </v>

3118
02:21:33.161 --> 02:21:33.470
<v Speaker 1>a multiverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other is,</v>

3119
02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:38.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain the universe in terms of this </v>

3120
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.510
<v Speaker 1>beer bottle that I talked about you </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier.</v>

3121
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:39.290
<v Speaker 1>So you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a video.</v>

3122
02:21:39.291 --> 02:21:42.140
<v Speaker 1>You can watch that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at this theory of inflation,</v>

3123
02:21:42.141 --> 02:21:44.940
<v Speaker 1>which actually says our universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the qual,</v>

3124
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:50.110
<v Speaker 1>the qualities that we see of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe can best be explained if some </v>

3125
02:21:50.110 --> 02:21:53.440
<v Speaker 1>early time in the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe when it was a billionth of a </v>

3126
02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:55.250
<v Speaker 1>billionth of a billionth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a billionth of a second old.</v>

3127
02:21:55.850 --> 02:22:00.850
<v Speaker 1>It had a huge expansion suddenly and </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased in size by 30 orders of </v>

3128
02:22:00.850 --> 02:22:05.140
<v Speaker 1>magnitude in size.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a billionth of a billionth of a </v>

3129
02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:05.140
<v Speaker 1>billionth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a billionth of a second,</v>

3130
02:22:05.140 --> 02:22:10.030
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way particle physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests is highly plausible even </v>

3131
02:22:10.030 --> 02:22:10.190
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

3132
02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and then and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it would produce a universe </v>

3133
02:22:15.520 --> 02:22:15.970
<v Speaker 1>that looks more or less like we look </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you look like and,</v>

3134
02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:21.280
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's right now the only explanation </v>

3135
02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:21.830
<v Speaker 1>of how that would cause the university </v>
<v Speaker 1>to look like,</v>

3136
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.550
<v Speaker 1>what it looks like.</v>

3137
02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:25.620
<v Speaker 1>But the neat thing about inflation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's eternal.</v>

3138
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:29.310
<v Speaker 1>So inflation that puffing up ended in </v>
<v Speaker 1>our universe.</v>

3139
02:22:29.311 --> 02:22:30.090
<v Speaker 1>And then boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hot,</v>

3140
02:22:30.091 --> 02:22:31.530
<v Speaker 1>big bang followed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3141
02:22:31.531 --> 02:22:36.531
<v Speaker 1>So the region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe universe puffed up by huge </v>

3142
02:22:36.531 --> 02:22:38.220
<v Speaker 1>amount than all of that energy which was</v>
<v Speaker 1>stored and empty space got released like</v>

3143
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:42.000
<v Speaker 1>the beer bottle and we got a hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big bang and the rest is history,</v>

3144
02:22:42.450 --> 02:22:47.450
<v Speaker 1>but that's locally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somewhere else between us and their </v>

3145
02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:51.660
<v Speaker 1>space is still expanding exponentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>and faster and faster and faster.</v>

3146
02:22:51.720 --> 02:22:54.060
<v Speaker 1>And only maybe somewhere else today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

3147
02:22:54.090 --> 02:22:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Like an ice crystal forming boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That that region of space is suddenly </v>

3148
02:22:59.090 --> 02:23:01.740
<v Speaker 1>left inflation and maybe a guilt a </v>
<v Speaker 1>gazillion years in the future,</v>

3149
02:23:01.741 --> 02:23:04.200
<v Speaker 1>there'll be another region of space </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's expanding away from it,</v>

3150
02:23:04.201 --> 02:23:09.201
<v Speaker 1>so much faster than light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll never know about it where </v>

3151
02:23:09.201 --> 02:23:09.330
<v Speaker 1>suddenly that region leads inflation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

3152
02:23:09.331 --> 02:23:14.331
<v Speaker 1>another hot big bang happens and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>turns out in each of those hot big </v>

3153
02:23:14.331 --> 02:23:15.420
<v Speaker 1>bangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the inflation ends,</v>

3154
02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:20.540
<v Speaker 1>depending upon how it ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laws of physics could be different </v>

3155
02:23:20.540 --> 02:23:21.210
<v Speaker 1>in that universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we tend to think.</v>

3156
02:23:21.211 --> 02:23:26.211
<v Speaker 1>It's quite likely that there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many separate regions of space and in </v>

3157
02:23:26.311 --> 02:23:31.311
<v Speaker 1>fact it's eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So such regions are forming eternally </v>

3158
02:23:31.311 --> 02:23:31.460
<v Speaker 1>for all time and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3159
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:36.590
<v Speaker 1>and there are hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big bangs happening in many regions and </v>

3160
02:23:36.590 --> 02:23:39.381
<v Speaker 1>the properties of each of those regions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're conducive to forming </v>

3161
02:23:39.381 --> 02:23:42.300
<v Speaker 1>galaxies and stars and planets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people may be different.</v>

3162
02:23:42.301 --> 02:23:47.301
<v Speaker 1>So we could say logically in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture that the reason the universe </v>

3163
02:23:47.301 --> 02:23:49.950
<v Speaker 1>looks like the way it does is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here to measure it.</v>

3164
02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we should leave it at that.</v>

3165
02:23:55.260 --> 02:23:56.610
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We should close with that.</v>

3166
02:23:56.611 --> 02:23:59.620
<v Speaker 3>That is the mindblower wind blowers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

3167
02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:01.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm glad I wore you out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not the other way around.</v>

3168
02:24:01.390 --> 02:24:03.130
<v Speaker 3>Was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you so much.</v>

3169
02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Fun fact mandated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

3170
02:24:04.850 --> 02:24:06.030
<v Speaker 3>that's two and a half hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3171
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:07.660
<v Speaker 3>Just by good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

3172
02:24:07.690 --> 02:24:12.690
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for you and me and my have </v>

3173
02:24:12.690 --> 02:24:12.690
<v Speaker 3>flown by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how the little strip.</v>

3174
02:24:12.690 --> 02:24:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that that was a mindblower.</v>

3175
02:24:12.940 --> 02:24:15.760
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank greatest story ever told so far.</v>

3176
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:18.100
<v Speaker 3>It's available now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get it an audio books.</v>

3177
02:24:18.101 --> 02:24:23.101
<v Speaker 3>It's on a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can get it on itunes and an audio </v>

3178
02:24:23.101 --> 02:24:23.101
<v Speaker 3>book form as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you very much.</v>

3179
02:24:23.101 --> 02:24:23.380
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really appreciate it.</v>

3180
02:24:23.381 --> 02:24:25.120
<v Speaker 3>It's been great to finally get to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>to you.</v>

3181
02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:27.330
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
