79
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>But thinking about the guilt that he must have suffered right after he nutted</v>

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>She does what's going on under the table.</v>

105
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.640
<v Speaker 1>As soon as they got in their car,</v>

106
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:45.331
<v Speaker 1>her and her husband,</v>

107
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 1>she was like that motherfucker.</v>

108
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Did you see the way he kissed Elizabeth Hurley?</v>

109
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.991
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

114
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.801
<v Speaker 1>You know what's funny though,</v>

115
00:02:55.801 --> 00:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

116
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>when I heard about this,</v>

117
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>it was so interesting that I heard conservatives come out the woodwork.</v>

118
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

119
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.921
<v Speaker 1>who was it?</v>

120
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it was rand Paul was like,</v>

121
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:05.021
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

122
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>this is terrible.</v>

123
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>The president should apologize,</v>

124
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute homie.</v>

125
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Where were you when Newt Gingrich was running for office?</v>

126
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Because didn't he drop his wife and then deal with another woman and then deal</v>

127
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:16.714
<v Speaker 1>with another one?</v>

128
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.800
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that,</v>

129
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

130
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.903
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

131
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>the benchmark of men that are in power,</v>

132
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>they're just looking to play.</v>

133
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

134
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.681
<v Speaker 1>All these shit heads.</v>

135
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Are they just using that like it's points on a blanket and nobody ever fucked?</v>

136
00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

137
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>they scored on you.</v>

138
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:29.591
<v Speaker 1>They caught you,</v>

139
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.341
<v Speaker 1>they scored on you.</v>

140
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>They got points now and they just can use those points to try to shut you down</v>

141
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:34.654
<v Speaker 1>and build them up.</v>

142
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>But it all just makes everybody look like a bunch of bitches.</v>

143
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Because if that was going on amongst your friends,</v>

144
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say if there was 10 of your friends and one of your friends was not</v>

145
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>particularly happy with his wife's relationship,</v>

146
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>and so he started banging Elizabeth Hurley and all you guys found out about it,</v>

147
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't dry snitch if he would play Tom Sizemore I'll tell you went out and</v>

148
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

149
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.083
<v Speaker 1>you snitch.</v>

150
