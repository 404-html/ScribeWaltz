<v Speaker 1>A rambler.</v>

12
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what a great invention.</v>

13
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:29.571
<v Speaker 1>How'd you guys will?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guys were just getting hammered and </v>

14
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.371
<v Speaker 1>throwing anything in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same way for folks who haven't been </v>

15
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>properly introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Ben.</v>

16
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is here and he's the one.</v>

17
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>He was in the podcast from paradise when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in Lanai.</v>

18
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Kind of my all time favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the island or the podcast thing,</v>

19
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>but it was all awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole damn thing,</v>

20
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>but people are drinking those cat ladies</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

21
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>which is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not to bad.</v>

22
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>That's terrible idea to dudley making </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

23
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

24
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>He Poured Tequila and red bull into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>glass of red wine and we're looking at </v>

25
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.430
<v Speaker 1>him like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is.</v>

26
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>And people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hashtags are wrong,</v>

27
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people are hashtagging,</v>

28
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>of course I'd do it sometimes just to </v>
<v Speaker 1>poke fun at everybody,</v>

29
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>but I've had probably a dozen people </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

30
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:15.591
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried the cat lady last night just </v>

31
00:01:15.591 --> 00:01:15.970
<v Speaker 1>drinking it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to say they drank it in,</v>

32
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>which is just don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't do it,</v>

33
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>but right brain is actually pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get that.</v>

34
00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some meat,</v>

35
00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:28.041
<v Speaker 1>some trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some bose involved and stuff just got </v>

36
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>put together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've had these before.</v>

37
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>They actually tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

38
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.190
<v Speaker 1>there's like no benefit that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>from our list.</v>

39
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like all the science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we put it into Alpha brain,</v>

40
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>all the non science from whiskey out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>window phones.</v>

41
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's made zero leaps forward but we're </v>

43
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>good where we are currently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it my balance us out though.</v>

44
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>It keeps from getting too stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which that's a,</v>

45
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>that's a good achievement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do big issue with whiskey.</v>

46
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>What does this whiskey we got here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

47
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if Jamie just kinda like </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it out there.</v>

48
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>Gave us at the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called Angel's envy.</v>

49
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like a think like angels are</v>

50
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>really envious of whiskey though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

51
00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>you're hanging out with God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can fly.</v>

52
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.800
<v Speaker 1>We want to buy it in a store with angel </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended enough money.</v>

53
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that sounded balances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got wings on the back.</v>

54
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's they're trying to market with</v>
<v Speaker 1>red bull.</v>

55
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:27.171
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are always the wings on the back </v>

56
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>of a stripper that cries a lot and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were an angel and envy are both names,</v>

57
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 1>strippers that I've that I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen that.</v>

58
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a really good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>The wings on the back is always a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>

60
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're listening,</v>

61
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 1>if you're drinking whiskey with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an Alpha brand,</v>

62
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>you can do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can put whatever you want,</v>

63
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>whatever kind of whiskey you want in </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

64
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>You're very open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>The Alpha brain cancels that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be,</v>

66
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>give me the worst whiskey in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Alpha brain makes it better.</v>

67
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Have you taken this anywhere?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This a right brain have not really </v>

68
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>counting on your listeners and deadlies </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans to do that.</v>

69
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be organic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can spread brown the next time you go</v>

70
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>to some exotic location and they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

71
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in Nepal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

72
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to a northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Territory's will here.</v>

73
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Or your boys on your hat there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The eastmans oh you really like a week.</v>

74
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>

75
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>You do it up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribou and dall sheep.</v>

76
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.450
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're doing a film about their Yeti </v>

77
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.450
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeti presents to them about their family</v>

78
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.381
<v Speaker 1>history and the northwest territories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like technically what part of Alaska is </v>

79
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

80
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It's east of Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>East of British Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up towards the Arctic circle.</v>

82
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>So we'll fly into norman wells and go </v>
<v Speaker 1>north from there,</v>

83
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.650
<v Speaker 1>up into the Mckenzie mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are about as far north as you can </v>

84
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.131
<v Speaker 1>get before hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Arctic circle will be sniffing the </v>

85
00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>arctic circle and most days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's still still Alaska,</v>

86
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

87
00:03:45.711 --> 00:03:46.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

88
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Its own territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real.</v>

89
00:03:47.681 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

90
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Same as Yukon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

91
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think Yukon Moose or whatever.</v>

92
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>They're all their own territories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

93
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he's Yukon is not Alaska.</v>

94
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>We'd have to look that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be right.</v>

95
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to look at a globe and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking.</v>

96
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not questioning like I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know either,</v>

97
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.670
<v Speaker 1>but northwest territories is its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

98
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:05.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who owns that?</v>

99
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>

100
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like past Alaska becomes Canada </v>

102
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is getting real deep.</v>

103
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I should've known Kevin on this package </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

104
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:17.860
<v Speaker 1>like tell me the history of northwest </v>
<v Speaker 1>territories.</v>

105
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.090
<v Speaker 1>So here it is right now on a map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you kind of.</v>

106
00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:26.091
<v Speaker 1>Territory is the Yukon is slightly east </v>
<v Speaker 1>or east rather east and then the </v>

107
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>northwest territories course is further </v>
<v Speaker 1>east above Alberta.</v>

108
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.670
<v Speaker 1>So you're getting up there into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the Arctic and it is connected to </v>

109
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.120
<v Speaker 1>But it's also connected to Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

111
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>it's to Yukon Party Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the provinces had it.</v>

112
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting confused myself.</v>

113
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that the British Columbia </v>

114
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.090
<v Speaker 1>section.</v>

115
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.090
<v Speaker 1>So I saw a British Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was part of Alaska.</v>

116
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>You could read the wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always really.</v>

117
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 1>It's really different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dramatic,</v>

118
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>wild mountainous and sparsely populated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy that it's north of northern </v>

119
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people like,</v>

120
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:08.161
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not fucking cold enough here </v>

121
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:08.161
<v Speaker 1>in the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to keep going.</v>

122
00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Well they have lakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got.</v>

123
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have lakes for like a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

124
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I think when we're up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about last week.</v>

125
00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I think when we're up there there'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

126
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 1>it'll be daylight 24 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>

127
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I believe now when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you bring like one of those eyeball </v>

128
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.390
<v Speaker 1>cover things?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

129
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to.</v>

130
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mask,</v>

131
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I have all covered things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you have to.</v>

132
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you really,</v>

133
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>unless you can get into 10 just Kinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>zonked out.</v>

134
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 12,</v>

135
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:38.731
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 12 or 13 days up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you get to day five or </v>

136
00:05:38.731 --> 00:05:42.121
<v Speaker 1>six years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're living out of your </v>

137
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:42.121
<v Speaker 1>backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're carrying probably 50,</v>

138
00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:45.691
<v Speaker 1>60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 pounds in your pack and climbing </v>

139
00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:45.691
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean it's probably the time you get</v>

140
00:05:45.691 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>laid down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it matters.</v>

141
00:05:46.751 --> 00:05:51.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on now when you do </v>

142
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:51.751
<v Speaker 1>something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

143
00:05:51.751 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>how much gear you guys bring you living </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely out of your backpack.</v>

144
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>So when the float plane is what in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the plane takes you to base camp,</v>

145
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:59.830
<v Speaker 1>which I think in this case is there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a float plane.</v>

146
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll be,</v>

147
00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:05.540
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a wheel plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll we can take 50 pounds and then </v>

148
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>sounds each 50 pounds plus your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>

149
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.960
<v Speaker 1>plus you evaluate and then six days in </v>
<v Speaker 1>they will either come in a helicopter </v>

150
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.981
<v Speaker 1>and pick us up and move us if we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>having any luck or they'll just drop us </v>

151
00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:14.981
<v Speaker 1>more gear.</v>

152
00:06:14.981 --> 00:06:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the plan would be take 50 pounds of </v>

153
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>essential gear and then have other gear </v>
<v Speaker 1>as backup back at base camp.</v>

154
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you fly into base camp.</v>

155
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like for me it will be like Austin </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Denver,</v>

156
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Denver to Edmonton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edmonton to Norman Wells,</v>

157
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>hoppa charter to base camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from there fly out into the </v>

158
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>hunting areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many days travel is that?</v>

159
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>It was like two days and change two days</v>
<v Speaker 1>solid of just flying.</v>

160
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Just flying was your overnighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they.</v>

161
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean they run like one added Norman </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wells.</v>

162
00:06:44.811 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>They run like one flight a day or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

163
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.430
<v Speaker 1>One or two flights a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be really dedicated to this </v>

164
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.490
<v Speaker 1>kind of experience to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just travel for two days.</v>

165
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I once you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

166
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>that's like the only way to go though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

167
00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>It's once you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only way to go.</v>

168
00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>That's Douchey to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like the best.</v>

169
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>Most when you get back you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

170
00:07:01.821 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>that sucked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't want to change it.</v>

171
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 1>You something happens to people when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they do those like exotic location,</v>

172
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>like when they go sheep hunting and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>risked their lives.</v>

173
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:17.651
<v Speaker 1>Like I've seen some video of guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I saw some video of you guys when </v>

174

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

175
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>When you were risking your lives with </v>
<v Speaker 1>every step.</v>

176
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole time too.</v>

177
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

178
00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>we got up to this one area where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep live.</v>

179
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.440
<v Speaker 1>You're just where we were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

180
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.660
<v Speaker 1>in New Zealand with green tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We when you get up into,</v>

181
00:07:32.661 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 1>so there's like beachwood far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're looking at like a 3000,</v>

182
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 1>30 540,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>foot mountain,</v>

183
00:07:37.461 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

184
00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>we stayed in a little hut in the river </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley and so when you're down there,</v>

185
00:07:42.051 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you're looking up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

186
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:43.940
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where the tar live.</v>

187
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

188
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>43,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet from where we are right now.</v>

189
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.010
<v Speaker 1>For people that don't know is a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking animal Himalayan.</v>

190
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a lord of the rings or </v>

191
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really does.</v>

192
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a wooly mammoth,</v>

193
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.650
<v Speaker 1>but just a miniature version.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

194
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>really crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll leave furry,</v>

195
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>shaggy a goat essentially like a goat </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash sheet.</v>

196
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the funny part about all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

197
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:12.971
<v Speaker 1>is when you heard those right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the image they look like where </v>

198
00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you would look across these </v>

199
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.971
<v Speaker 1>little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Alpine valleys and you'd see him </v>

200
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:19.970
<v Speaker 1>look like a black bear looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant black bear.</v>

201
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:22.700
<v Speaker 1>And he just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I and what is that thing?</v>

202
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:28.020
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not like you have some really </v>

203
00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>cool adventure or on this podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not me.</v>

204
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>When I see that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what the fuck am?</v>

205
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Where am I like it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's wild looking.</v>

206
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they live up in the Alpine.</v>

207
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 1>So there you've got the beech wood </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>

208
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:43.931
<v Speaker 1>which is probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would just say hiking straight up </v>

209
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:43.931
<v Speaker 1>for about an hour and a half or two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>

210
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:46.070
<v Speaker 1>And is that an innovation species for </v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand?</v>

211
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.840
<v Speaker 1>They're feral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not feral.</v>

212
00:08:47.841 --> 00:08:48.440
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

213
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 1>They're non native.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all the mammals on the island,</v>

214
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>they're non native.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them were all were introduced by.</v>

215
00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And I wish I had really looked up </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone specific,</v>

216
00:08:56.441 --> 00:08:58.110
<v Speaker 1>but they are all introduced by other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

217
00:08:58.111 --> 00:09:03.111
<v Speaker 1>Europe sent animals over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teddy Roosevelt sent some animals over </v>

218
00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:03.111
<v Speaker 1>there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

219
00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:06.271
<v Speaker 1>I hear you're going to want these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem over there to get on </v>

220
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:10.590
<v Speaker 1>a whole different subject is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on that island,</v>

221
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>the residence of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of New Zealand don't value those animals</v>

222
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 1>as part of the landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just there.</v>

223
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farrell would be a good term sheet of </v>

224
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.150
<v Speaker 1>the way they view them to the value they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have on them.</v>

225
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:23.070
<v Speaker 1>We have like moose mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

226
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.770
<v Speaker 1>that's part of our ethos as a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

227
00:09:25.771 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And our ecosystems and our ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been here before.</v>

228
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:31.940
<v Speaker 1>We were some level and so over there </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

229
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>they'll jump in the helicopter and mowed</v>
<v Speaker 1>down like 40 red stag on a weekend </v>

230
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>because they want to control the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population one because there's no winter</v>

231
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.320
<v Speaker 1>kill and their predation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>

232
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>But they also just don't see a big red </v>
<v Speaker 1>stag the way we see a big elk.</v>

233
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.910
<v Speaker 1>They just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the value for it down </v>

234
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.910
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

235
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 1>it's also the weird thing about having </v>
<v Speaker 1>no predators is how do you handle that?</v>

236
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Do you bring in predators?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if they don't,</v>

237
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:59.300
<v Speaker 1>they risk disease and there's all sorts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of weird things that can happen like,</v>

238
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>like they have on Lanai.</v>

239
00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

240
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

241
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:07.530
<v Speaker 1>And we've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done that in this country with </v>

242
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:09.981
<v Speaker 1>bringing down a northwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the timber wolf that we brought </v>

243
00:10:09.981 --> 00:10:12.941
<v Speaker 1>him down and put them in the states and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's while that may seem like a good </v>

244
00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:16.701
<v Speaker 1>solution and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were in British Columbia Hunt </v>

245
00:10:16.701 --> 00:10:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Moose together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw some calf skeletons.</v>

246
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We showed that picture on the podcast.</v>

247
00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:23.250
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing has just been decimated.</v>

248
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.420
<v Speaker 1>Those wolves and I saw in Montana one </v>
<v Speaker 1>time I saw them running circles.</v>

249
00:10:27.421 --> 00:10:32.421
<v Speaker 1>They run in like concentric circles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just run like a bullseye pattern when </v>

250
00:10:32.421 --> 00:10:35.361
<v Speaker 1>they're hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like the packs and I just </v>

251
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>watched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were.</v>

252
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I killed my elk on the first day of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunt and I was watching and you would </v>

253
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:46.281
<v Speaker 1>show there be a different wolf kill like</v>
<v Speaker 1>every other day in this valley and it's </v>

254
00:10:46.281 --> 00:10:50.781
<v Speaker 1>like the wolves were just running in </v>
<v Speaker 1>circles and I did see a couple of bulls </v>

255
00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:50.781
<v Speaker 1>fighting that in that trip.</v>

256
00:10:50.781 --> 00:10:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Trying to call him in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

257
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:53.470
<v Speaker 1>some of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

258
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.990
<v Speaker 1>two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

259
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 1>That was like 1200 yards away and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>a rifle and I was thinking.</v>

260
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean once you see,</v>

261
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:04.210
<v Speaker 1>when you see a dead fon everyday you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunting and pre a new,</v>

262
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.780
<v Speaker 1>maybe not new to that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but knew that week you started to think </v>

263
00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.330
<v Speaker 1>like how if this pack work this valley </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a full year,</v>

264
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 1>what could they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's numbers to that.</v>

265
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere at some people have figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>out what,</v>

266
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.870
<v Speaker 1>how many elk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A year upon the eldest son,</v>

267
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Kale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the wolves were reintroduced,</v>

268
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:24.590
<v Speaker 1>there was an issue with overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it.</v>

269
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's where I think that's probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 come in,</v>

270
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

271
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I value that animal.</v>

272
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:34.461
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to pay you for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to help you conserve that </v>

273
00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:34.630
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

274
00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:36.580
<v Speaker 1>that becomes very problematic for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

275
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Like when you start talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves,</v>

276
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:43.980
<v Speaker 1>dogs does wilderness or another one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those ones that black bears too.</v>

277
00:11:43.981 --> 00:11:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

278
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 1>you don't eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even more than any tools way more</v>

279
00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:54.291
<v Speaker 1>than any that was talking to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a gal in my work that I was </v>

280
00:11:54.291 --> 00:11:55.240
<v Speaker 1>talking to and she lives in Austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas and is very,</v>

281
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 1>not a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but works at Yeti,</v>

282
00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 1>and so she's around hunting and we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about wolves and I just said,</v>

283
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:07.201
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a really hard and opinion </v>

284
00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:07.201
<v Speaker 1>on bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've not spent enough time around them.</v>

285
00:12:07.201 --> 00:12:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I just know that their meat processors </v>
<v Speaker 1>on four legs,</v>

286
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.530
<v Speaker 1>they give no shits about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

287
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.580
<v Speaker 1>They're not just eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just eat what feels their </v>

288
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:18.070
<v Speaker 1>belly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They eat and then they eat more and they</v>

289
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 1>kill more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all they're wired to do.</v>

290
00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that in action,</v>

291
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:26.491
<v Speaker 1>so that's all I really know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether that's good for an </v>

292
00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:26.491
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

293
00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and she just said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

294
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:32.371
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know that it's hunting </v>
<v Speaker 1>has really bad wolves will seem to have </v>

295
00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:34.690
<v Speaker 1>a good pr agent and hunting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>management have a terrible pr agent,</v>

296
00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that,</v>

297
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

298
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:42.320
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a sect of people that are </v>

299
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:42.320
<v Speaker 1>really glorifying a wolf for good </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason.</v>

300
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's awesome animal that majestic </v>

301
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.631
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time there is a </v>

302
00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:48.631
<v Speaker 1>juxtaposition of that that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>told to.</v>

303
00:12:48.631 --> 00:12:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a big part of the issue is that </v>

304
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.290
<v Speaker 1>people know that they virtually wiped </v>
<v Speaker 1>them out in North America at one point </v>

305
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.431
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think people feel guilty about </v>

306
00:12:59.431 --> 00:12:59.431
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

307
00:12:59.431 --> 00:12:59.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they should feel guilty.</v>

308
00:12:59.431 --> 00:13:01.390
<v Speaker 1>They should feel ashamed about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mallard duck elk.</v>

309
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.490
<v Speaker 1>People don't know the detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:08.491
<v Speaker 1>But we brought those back to the point </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the numbers are higher than </v>

311
00:13:08.491 --> 00:13:11.221
<v Speaker 1>they've ever been before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But those same people don't know how </v>

312
00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:11.221
<v Speaker 1>that happened though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

313
00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Those same people aren't aware of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they just see white tails around.</v>

314
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:13.420
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

315
00:13:13.421 --> 00:13:15.220
<v Speaker 1>that's annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People with the car.</v>

316
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't know that it turn of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

317
00:13:16.571 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 1>They were almost all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Because we market hunting them to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

319
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 1>and so I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just,</v>

320
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.580
<v Speaker 1>it's just education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

321
00:13:24.581 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I just think people need to seek the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other side,</v>

322
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:30.220
<v Speaker 1>which I always try to do and you do all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

323
00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 1>just seek whatever the other side is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the hunting is not always the way to</v>

324
00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:38.221
<v Speaker 1>go yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's inconvenient because like it's </v>

325
00:13:38.221 --> 00:13:38.221
<v Speaker 1>hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>

326
00:13:38.221 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 1>say if you're a vegetarian or a Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get your information </v>

327
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.361
<v Speaker 1>from animal rights activists and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be biased in that direction.</v>

328
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're a hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get your information </v>

329
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.030
<v Speaker 1>from hunting and conservation groups and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be biased in the other way.</v>

330
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.550
<v Speaker 1>And I think wolves are a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're awesome.</v>

331
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:55.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

332
00:13:55.830 --> 00:14:00.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't not like walls I think know </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunter's like wipe the wolves that I've </v>

333
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:05.041
<v Speaker 1>never heard that I've just started like </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the carrying capacity for this </v>

334
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:05.041
<v Speaker 1>state but this region for wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

335
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:06.680
<v Speaker 1>How many can there be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

336
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.510
<v Speaker 1>and I know in a lot of cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.000
<v Speaker 1>the biologists would say one thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

338
00:14:11.001 --> 00:14:16.001
<v Speaker 1>here's 100 bulbs in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when it ballooned up to a </v>

339
00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 1>thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they argued for hunters come in and help</v>

340
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 1>put that population down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were still a pushback,</v>

341
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:20.800
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

342
00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:24.730
<v Speaker 1>we said we agreed upon scientifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically,</v>

343
00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

344
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>we know the problem is that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiable at all.</v>

345
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.450
<v Speaker 1>It should have been like once the wolves</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit 2000 starting,</v>

346
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:36.510
<v Speaker 1>then you start a hunting season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the real issue is it's </v>

347
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.350
<v Speaker 1>incredibly hard to shoot a wolf like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

348
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as you ought and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wolf and kill them.</v>

349
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 1>They're really smart and they think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Tara and New Zealand.</v>

350
00:14:44.231 --> 00:14:46.630
<v Speaker 1>You can't just like if they're over </v>
<v Speaker 1>populated in there,</v>

351
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:47.460
<v Speaker 1>you can't just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

352
00:14:47.461 --> 00:14:49.120
<v Speaker 1>we'll just walk up the hill and crack a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple.</v>

353
00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:51.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty big feat.</v>

354
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:56.020
<v Speaker 1>So they jumped in a helicopter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gone down the tar that way to </v>

355
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn.</v>

356
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:59.510
<v Speaker 1>So how do they determine whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be getting them down?</v>

357
00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:04.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know like the holistic </v>

358
00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:07.361
<v Speaker 1>method that I use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know our guide up there this year </v>

359
00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:07.361
<v Speaker 1>was just talking about he would go to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

360
00:15:07.361 --> 00:15:10.040
<v Speaker 1>to the sheep stations or the ranch </v>
<v Speaker 1>owners or are some of the areas.</v>

361
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:15.220
<v Speaker 1>Some of those big mountain are own </v>
<v Speaker 1>privately and some of the areas where </v>

362
00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:19.901
<v Speaker 1>they were down a little bit lower than </v>
<v Speaker 1>they would just say go out today and </v>

363
00:15:19.901 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 1>kill a hundred and that's what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do and it was,</v>

364
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.720
<v Speaker 1>it was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't seem to me to be too </v>

365
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:25.720
<v Speaker 1>scientific in the way they went about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

366
00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's a private land owner telling </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

367
00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:30.920
<v Speaker 1>hey these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an infestation essentially,</v>

368
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:34.790
<v Speaker 1>and my argument to them was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just,</v>

369
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:36.830
<v Speaker 1>these animals are here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going anywhere,</v>

370
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.390
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to swim over to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia.</v>

371
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.030
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you just treat them like we </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat our,</v>

372
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>our wildlife whilst you just accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

373
00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:48.850
<v Speaker 1>And then there was some people down </v>
<v Speaker 1>there that were agreed with me whole </v>

374
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:51.581
<v Speaker 1>heartedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people in the guide and outfitting </v>

375
00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:53.320
<v Speaker 1>community just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you just accept these animals </v>

376
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.170
<v Speaker 1>as part of your landscape and treat them</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

377
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a swelling opinion down there for</v>

378
00:15:57.441 --> 00:15:58.070
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

379
00:15:58.071 --> 00:16:03.071
<v Speaker 1>how do they accept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they just treat them like their </v>

380
00:16:03.071 --> 00:16:03.740
<v Speaker 1>pasts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say pass because they do have</v>

381
00:16:03.741 --> 00:16:08.741
<v Speaker 1>some value because hunters from around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world would go down there like we </v>

382
00:16:08.741 --> 00:16:08.741
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't have a lot of,</v>

383
00:16:08.741 --> 00:16:13.171
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that is on public lands or </v>

384
00:16:13.171 --> 00:16:13.171
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private land in those high fence places.</v>

385
00:16:13.171 --> 00:16:14.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's basically stag.</v>

386
00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:15.860
<v Speaker 1>You can't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be,</v>

387
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:18.900
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to high fence for shaming tar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just live in places very.</v>

388
00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 1>He'd been down to put up if he tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be dumb.</v>

389
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 1>But stag stag is a whole different deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>

390
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's because they're so big,</v>

391
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.440
<v Speaker 1>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people want to go there and get a </v>

392
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:31.440
<v Speaker 1>big day rack of antlers to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>discredit,</v>

393
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>like they have harvested the bad parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our hunting culture and marketed it </v>

394
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.050
<v Speaker 1>brilliantly.</v>

395
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:36.280
<v Speaker 1>They have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

396
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.840
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's a lot of people down</v>
<v Speaker 1>there that would push back on that,</v>

397
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that idea.</v>

398
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:41.270
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain that,</v>

399
00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:46.271
<v Speaker 1>what that means by the bad parts and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the American hunting culture </v>

400
00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:46.550
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of Europeans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>go there too.</v>

401
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.550
<v Speaker 1>I think the parts of the trophy hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hey come down here and,</v>

402
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and work on this five inch tag.</v>

403
00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:55.590
<v Speaker 1>We've got it here and they have agents </v>
<v Speaker 1>that go around and sell it for $500.</v>

404
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.280
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about folks is the size of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antlers,</v>

405
00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:03.310
<v Speaker 1>not the size of the actual animal itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people get super obsessed and they </v>

406
00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.691
<v Speaker 1>fetish numbers like you know the score </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what a score is for people don't </v>

407
00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:13.541
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They take a tape measure and they go </v>

408
00:17:13.541 --> 00:17:15.791
<v Speaker 1>over very specific sections of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>antlers and they calculate all the </v>

409
00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:19.901
<v Speaker 1>measurements together and when they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they come up with some number and </v>

410
00:17:19.901 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>there's these milestone benchmark </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers like a 200 inch white tails,</v>

411
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:28.690
<v Speaker 1>a huge deer or a 400 inch elk is a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>elk.</v>

412
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:32.020
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get stags and go to 500 and more,</v>

413
00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.540
<v Speaker 1>more and more insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is it as big as an elk looking </v>

414
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:40.010
<v Speaker 1>animal body size?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not quite close but not quite.</v>

415
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 1>And and I and one of the sheep stations </v>
<v Speaker 1>we hunted with originally,</v>

416
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.200
<v Speaker 1>they farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They essentially form red deer,</v>

417
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 1>red deer and stag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing are walking around in,</v>

418
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:54.360
<v Speaker 1>these are the same animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No down there.</v>

419
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Red Stag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red years.</v>

420
00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Basically the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you find red deer in Europe and </v>

421
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.040
<v Speaker 1>they're different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh genius.</v>

422
00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Why do they call them a stack but isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>a stagnant of male stag,</v>

423
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.520
<v Speaker 1>stag and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and high and being the female h I n D,</v>

424
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:08.550
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

425
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:12.540
<v Speaker 1>but you would call it a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would call the animals are red deer.</v>

426
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it called low 500 in Europe </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they call it a red deer there.</v>

427
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:19.860
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sure those deer came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>there anyway.</v>

428
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.860
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sure it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they came and they dropped them off </v>

429
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.980
<v Speaker 1>in the 18 hundreds just to turn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole place into a giant like hunting </v>

430
00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.110
<v Speaker 1>provision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

431
00:18:28.111 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Some level at some level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to read the history of that.</v>

432
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:33.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't really haven't gone that far </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

433
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 1>but he said that before they came there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no mammals there.</v>

434
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what a weird patch of land.</v>

435
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:43.400
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird like New Zealand is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is definitely coming from where we come </v>

436
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.780
<v Speaker 1>from and all the things we have and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>just find it normal that we can hunt how</v>

437
00:18:45.781 --> 00:18:50.781
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many huntable species are there on </v>

438
00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:50.781
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

439
00:18:50.781 --> 00:18:52.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this continent going down there,</v>

440
00:18:52.321 --> 00:18:57.321
<v Speaker 1>it's just such a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in the end they celebrate the </v>

441
00:18:57.321 --> 00:19:00.561
<v Speaker 1>outdoor culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They celebrate hunting and fishing in </v>

442
00:19:00.561 --> 00:19:02.721
<v Speaker 1>the way that almost in the way that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>do and they have public land much like </v>

443
00:19:02.721 --> 00:19:06.591
<v Speaker 1>we do and they're publicly and his is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more revered and more well managed and </v>

444
00:19:06.591 --> 00:19:07.170
<v Speaker 1>better taken care of.</v>

445
00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I think that our public lands and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>more usable and so they have all these </v>

446
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.340
<v Speaker 1>like similar properties that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

447
00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but at some level they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they just got poor luck.</v>

448
00:19:18.061 --> 00:19:22.680
<v Speaker 1>They don't have native mammals too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the Bald Eagle to put on</v>

449
00:19:22.681 --> 00:19:23.970
<v Speaker 1>their master.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

450
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.360
<v Speaker 1>they just have these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

451
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.620
<v Speaker 1>essentially shammy tar and tar aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not native either.</v>

452
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.500
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of those.</v>

453
00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:33.690
<v Speaker 1>None of them native.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of them.</v>

454
00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 1>They also have Canadian geese that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not native.</v>

455
00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you notice you used to have the </v>

456
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.390
<v Speaker 1>biggest ego in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

457
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

458
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:46.251
<v Speaker 1>to have an eagle called the Haast Eagle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and apparently they killed them off in </v>

459
00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:48.180
<v Speaker 1>the 14 hundreds and they were so big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's speculation.</v>

460
00:19:48.181 --> 00:19:50.370
<v Speaker 1>They used to eat people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd kill them all.</v>

461
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.580
<v Speaker 1>Foot 14 foot wingspan I think is what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out.</v>

462
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:55.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exaggerating if you've ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>over there.</v>

463
00:19:55.571 --> 00:20:00.571
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is like if it's a place where </v>

464
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:00.571
<v Speaker 1>that kind of eagle would live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looked like.</v>

465
00:20:00.571 --> 00:20:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Leash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what a hostile looks like.</v>

466
00:20:02.941 --> 00:20:07.941
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at an eagle that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally the size of a big person and </v>

467
00:20:08.031 --> 00:20:13.031
<v Speaker 1>that's up the look at the size of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking thing and so this can be.</v>

468
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.780
<v Speaker 1>That's Gandalf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean look,</v>

469
00:20:15.781 --> 00:20:17.790
<v Speaker 1>if it's as big as a person like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture,</v>

470
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:20.600
<v Speaker 1>go to that first picture again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

471
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.190
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how big that thing is.</v>

472
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that thing spreads its wings,</v>

473
00:20:24.991 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 1>if you had been over there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the landscape over there and some of the</v>

474
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Alpine areas that it looks like a place </v>
<v Speaker 1>where that would live,</v>

475
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:31.650
<v Speaker 1>that will kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing,</v>

476
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:35.520
<v Speaker 1>if they caught you hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just pull you off the cliff and</v>

477
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:36.840
<v Speaker 1>just drop you off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

478
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.040
<v Speaker 1>that's not a real hot steagall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The actual hostile with Google images.</v>

479
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.900
<v Speaker 1>We're getting all kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got Gandalf riding an eagle.</v>

480
00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:44.280
<v Speaker 1>We got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that one,</v>

481
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 1>that one with the emus or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck</v>

482
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:51.070
<v Speaker 2>those animals are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that a box that he's carried?</v>

483
00:20:51.071 --> 00:20:52.040
<v Speaker 2>That one's here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

484
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.850
<v Speaker 2>So when did it go extinct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie?</v>

485
00:20:54.851 --> 00:20:59.851
<v Speaker 2>What does it say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of the dude standing </v>

486
00:20:59.851 --> 00:21:00.610
<v Speaker 2>next to what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The skeleton of a hostile.</v>

487
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.510
<v Speaker 2>And he was that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That dude is awesome.</v>

488
00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:03.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

489
00:21:03.461 --> 00:21:05.830
<v Speaker 2>he looks like a wizard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's robes?</v>

490
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.100
<v Speaker 2>That's an ancient intellectual and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really opened the door for 1,680.</v>

491
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:17.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real thing actually lived on earth </v>

492
00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.380
<v Speaker 2>and of course it was known as the tiger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the tiger skin.</v>

493
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.380
<v Speaker 2>That's not that long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1,600.</v>

494
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was 14 hundreds because </v>

495
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.130
<v Speaker 2>there are six feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh wait.</v>

496
00:21:30.131 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Only 35 pounds and it had a wingspan of </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 feet.</v>

497
00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:34.450
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

498
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:35.470
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're hollow bones.</v>

499
00:21:35.471 --> 00:21:40.471
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thirty five pounds doesn't seem that </v>

500
00:21:40.471 --> 00:21:40.471
<v Speaker 2>much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

501
00:21:40.471 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 2>How do you go back to that picture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck is that thing?</v>

502
00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.420
<v Speaker 2>Thirty five pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing.</v>

503
00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:48.450
<v Speaker 2>Six feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 foot wingspan that things only 35 </v>

504
00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:48.730
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems wrong.</v>

505
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.920
<v Speaker 2>Turkeys heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you pick up a Turkey and like 25 </v>

506
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.870
<v Speaker 2>pound range.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the size of the thing.</v>

507
00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.980
<v Speaker 2>He's all big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I'm hanging around you.</v>

508
00:21:59.981 --> 00:22:04.981
<v Speaker 2>I hear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear about these evil mystical </v>

509
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:04.981
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

510
00:22:04.981 --> 00:22:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I think giant bear concern was that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Haast Eagle,</v>

511
00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:12.210
<v Speaker 2>they might have killed it off like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>local New Zealand folks might've killed </v>

512
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.000
<v Speaker 2>it off back then because they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating people.</v>

513
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.520
<v Speaker 2>I do not blame them and see if that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>

514
00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.850
<v Speaker 2>That might be a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did didn't know about this hostile you </v>

515
00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:21.700
<v Speaker 2>like doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know I weighed 100 at a place called</v>

516
00:22:21.701 --> 00:22:23.860
<v Speaker 2>hostile when you're were over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe connection.</v>

517
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.380
<v Speaker 2>Maybe we were really find and maybe find</v>
<v Speaker 2>some ancient eagle skull.</v>

518
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:33.080
<v Speaker 2>They go hook ball to see if at eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>people relationship with human google </v>

519
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:38.611
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See where it says relationship with </v>

520
00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:38.611
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

521
00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:38.611
<v Speaker 2>do do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

522
00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:38.690
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

523
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:43.700
<v Speaker 2>could have been possible to do even </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller Golden Eagles are capable of </v>

524
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 2>killing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

525
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.200
<v Speaker 2>They said they kill humans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which scientists believe could have been</v>

526
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:49.690
<v Speaker 2>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the name relates to the Eagle,</v>

527
00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 2>given the massive size of the strength </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the bird.</v>

528
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Even smaller Golden Eagles are capable </v>
<v Speaker 2>of killing praise.</v>

529
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:58.000
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] biggest Sitka deer or bear </v>
<v Speaker 2>cub?</v>

<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a baby.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

533
00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.630
<v Speaker 2>like a baby.</v>

534
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:12.060
<v Speaker 2>You don't think that a Predator like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that did not learn what it could and </v>

535
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.930
<v Speaker 2>could not go get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the sculptures,</v>

536
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.110
<v Speaker 2>goofy sculpture,</v>

<v Speaker 2>feet tall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

541
00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:28.570
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't 25 feet tall with a wingspan</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 11 point five meters.</v>

542
00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Thirty eight feet.</v>

<v Speaker 2>at news.</v>

<v Speaker 2>in the rainforest called the heartbeat </v>

548
00:23:44.401 --> 00:23:44.401
<v Speaker 2>eagle.</v>

<v Speaker 1>theater or something.</v>

<v Speaker 1>River.</v>

575
00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Will they also are the reason why the </v>
<v Speaker 1>movie jaws wasn't inspired by a great </v>

576
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:01.871
<v Speaker 1>white shark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was inspired by a series of attacks </v>

577
00:25:01.871 --> 00:25:02.960
<v Speaker 1>by bull sharks and freshwater rivers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>

578
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:08.550
<v Speaker 1>We talk about something else now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's freaking me out and they made the </v>

579
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.200
<v Speaker 1>music like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

580
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.440
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

581
00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your psyche,</v>

582
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:15.110
<v Speaker 1>that stuff changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would the music be for one of those</v>

583
00:25:15.111 --> 00:25:16.370
<v Speaker 1>big eagles?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same.</v>

584
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:19.020
<v Speaker 1>It would be death metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

585
00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.170
<v Speaker 1>He'd be out in the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do death metal music.</v>

586
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.800
<v Speaker 1>I've seen too much over in Nepal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have these big things called longer</v>

587
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:30.580
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like if it's a Nepali Griffin,</v>

588
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:33.200
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a big old vulture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at that thing up,</v>

589
00:25:33.201 --> 00:25:34.940
<v Speaker 1>see what the wingspan on those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'd be.</v>

590
00:25:34.941 --> 00:25:39.941
<v Speaker 1>We'd be up on some mountain glass if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your sheep and there'd be like a giant </v>

591
00:25:39.941 --> 00:25:40.460
<v Speaker 1>thing with the airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

592
00:25:40.461 --> 00:25:45.461
<v Speaker 1>nine foot wingspan and you could see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepiest part to me was you could see </v>

593
00:25:45.461 --> 00:25:48.200
<v Speaker 1>their heads move back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

594
00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.120
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

595
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 1>they were looking for shit and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take,</v>

596
00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:56.030
<v Speaker 1>they take and kill a baby sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a video,</v>

597
00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:58.670
<v Speaker 1>but after I got back and I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>freaking out about these things.</v>

598
00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a vulture.</v>

599
00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a Nepali.</v>

600
00:26:01.431 --> 00:26:02.750
<v Speaker 1>They call it a longer guyer.</v>

601
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And when we were there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they told us all you're gonna see </v>

602
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Griffin's so it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had a variety of names,</v>

603
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.220
<v Speaker 1>like everything there seems to have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

604
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:12.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

605
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.970
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a vulture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a giant.</v>

606
00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.310
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that they hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

607
00:26:16.311 --> 00:26:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought they just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

608
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.760
<v Speaker 1>I watched something on like a planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth about them and that they showed </v>

609
00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.760
<v Speaker 1>them in packs and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they eat bone marrow.</v>

610
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:27.560
<v Speaker 1>So they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would get a bone off the ground,</v>

611
00:26:27.561 --> 00:26:30.330
<v Speaker 1>fly up into the air and strategically </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop it onto the ground.</v>

612
00:26:30.331 --> 00:26:31.970
<v Speaker 1>So it would crack open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly down,</v>

613
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 1>eat the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat the insides.</v>

614
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

615
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 1>I haven't figured that out at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

616
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:42.491
<v Speaker 1>You could just see their brains churn </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like a lot of times you see it an </v>

617
00:26:42.491 --> 00:26:43.360
<v Speaker 1>animal in the sky burdened sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You sick.</v>

618
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 1>It's soaring around.</v>

619
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.480
<v Speaker 1>But you could see the predatory brain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this laundry guy as it flew above us,</v>

620
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.510
<v Speaker 1>just churn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I looked around for what to get </v>

621
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.300
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they say ravens are stupid.</v>

622
00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a smart as chimps.</v>

623
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you think about this bird,</v>

624
00:26:57.690 --> 00:26:59.700
<v Speaker 1>the bird's brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of what?</v>

625
00:26:59.701 --> 00:27:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Limit,</v>

626
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.310
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

627
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.150
<v Speaker 1>It literally found out I want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside that bone.</v>

628
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fly up and drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some vision net insights.</v>

629
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere along the line they figured a </v>

630
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.450
<v Speaker 1>long time ago how to drop things off </v>
<v Speaker 1>cliffs.</v>

631
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been doing that with goats and </v>

632
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.350
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a ton of videos of them grabbing</v>

633
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.020
<v Speaker 1>goats and pulling them out like eels </v>
<v Speaker 1>curricular.</v>

634
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the longer guy.</v>

635
00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 1>What is that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That thing looks fucking evil,</v>

636
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:27.550
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit.</v>

637
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 1>Look at that face on that thing.</v>

638
00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I think when I was over there when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were in in the mountains,</v>

639
00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:36.150
<v Speaker 1>I just wrote like a whole page about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this longer yard.</v>

640
00:27:36.151 --> 00:27:38.510
<v Speaker 1>We saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember it being taller.</v>

641
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.550
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of the zoo.</v>

642
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were jet black.</v>

643
00:27:43.981 --> 00:27:45.720
<v Speaker 1>The ones we saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how scary that looks,</v>

644
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:48.930
<v Speaker 1>but just being jet black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

645
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:50.880
<v Speaker 1>The coloration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that.</v>

646
00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:53.910
<v Speaker 1>A bone above mouth and swallowing whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

647
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive creature.</v>

648
00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.720
<v Speaker 1>Just like complete emotionless eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

649
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:01.740
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

650
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I vividly remember looking up at some </v>
<v Speaker 1>point and seeing these things floating </v>

651
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:11.460
<v Speaker 1>in the breeze and looking around and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that thing is savage.</v>

652
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.690
<v Speaker 1>How big do they get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>

653
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.190
<v Speaker 1>What a weird name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lumber guy or how do you spell it?</v>

654
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.540
<v Speaker 1>L A,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They described it originally our guy </v>

656
00:28:23.541 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 1>described as a griffin</v>

657
00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.970
<v Speaker 1>but at Griffin's like a mythological.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

658
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.940
<v Speaker 1>that's why I was thinking I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see this mythological.</v>

659
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.060
<v Speaker 1>I was waiting for something to land and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to us.</v>

660
00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:38.790
<v Speaker 1>That's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a place in New Zealand is like,</v>

671
00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:07.370
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 1>creepy,</v>

674
00:29:09.871 --> 00:29:14.280
<v Speaker 1>shitty looking animal to come down and </v>

<v Speaker 1>it could be in Nepal or Tibet.</v>

678
00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Over hunting has led to the endangerment</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the species.</v>

679
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.900
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

681
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:32.620
<v Speaker 1>animals or they have evolved to develop </v>

<v Speaker 1>has evolved or they have evolved and </v>

685
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:46.510

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.510
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

693
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Like if you eat a bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some people think bear acute,</v>

694
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:03.930
<v Speaker 1>but you got to cook the shit out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

695
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Can we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's address something right now.</v>

696
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear meat is is good.</v>

697
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:10.570
<v Speaker 1>It's very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very good.</v>

698
00:30:10.571 --> 00:30:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be depending upon what they.</v>

699
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Depending on what they eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're at.</v>

700
00:30:13.751 --> 00:30:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going in September to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince of Wales,</v>

701
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:20.761
<v Speaker 1>Alaska and you shoot one and it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>been eating salmon for a couple of </v>

702
00:30:20.761 --> 00:30:20.761
<v Speaker 1>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clams on the beach.</v>

703
00:30:20.761 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to eat that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

704
00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.110
<v Speaker 1>If you go somewhere where we're good </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetation and it's,</v>

705
00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.430
<v Speaker 1>it's well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a lot of fat on it.</v>

706
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.360
<v Speaker 1>It can be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would argue it's not to be celebrated.</v>

707
00:30:31.361 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

708
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:35.980
<v Speaker 1>it is not as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends.</v>

709
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Apparently if you eat a blueberry bear </v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the best meats ever.</v>

710
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never raves about for Nella does I?</v>

711
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.360
<v Speaker 1>I've had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten a lot of bears and I like </v>

712
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:48.360
<v Speaker 1>eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

713
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't throw them away or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would continue to hunt them,</v>

714
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:54.540
<v Speaker 1>but I've never had that same feeling of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like an elp tenderloin or elk backstrap,</v>

715
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.370
<v Speaker 1>like it's just not an x or an access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not in that category.</v>

716
00:30:57.371 --> 00:31:02.371
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like maybe we overcompensate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit because there's so much </v>

717
00:31:02.371 --> 00:31:02.371
<v Speaker 1>pushback on bear hunting.</v>

718
00:31:02.371 --> 00:31:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started talking about how great it </v>

719
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:06.900
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how great it is.</v>

720
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:06.900
<v Speaker 1>It's really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like it's not.</v>

721
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get that next level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you had smoked bear ham though?</v>

722
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.980
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty damn good.</v>

723
00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.380
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's smoked,</v>

724
00:31:14.381 --> 00:31:17.710
<v Speaker 1>it's Brian treated us and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest thing.</v>

725
00:31:17.711 --> 00:31:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can most meats that you're going</v>

726
00:31:20.431 --> 00:31:21.760
<v Speaker 1>to go hunting for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you treat,</v>

727
00:31:21.761 --> 00:31:24.220
<v Speaker 1>you look at the cut of meat and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat it accordingly.</v>

728
00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's no,</v>

729
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to obviously cut the chicken </v>
<v Speaker 1>gnosis you have to cook a bear all the </v>

730
00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.310
<v Speaker 1>way through to a certain temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that may be b,</v>

731
00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.170
<v Speaker 1>because I love rare meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be my problem.</v>

732
00:31:35.171 --> 00:31:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think maybe I think maybe a little</v>

733
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:40.210
<v Speaker 1>bit we could address the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>hunters a little bit of over compensated</v>

734
00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:45.211
<v Speaker 1>for the fact that people are pushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>back on them so much and that they're </v>

735
00:31:45.211 --> 00:31:45.211
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love bear.</v>

736
00:31:45.211 --> 00:31:46.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

737
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.920
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't choose it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite.</v>

738
00:31:47.921 --> 00:31:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't choose it over a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>meats.</v>

739
00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have bad,</v>

740
00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:53.800
<v Speaker 1>but like if someone told me you have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick one animal forever,</v>

741
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:57.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably say elk and bear would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty far down the list.</v>

742
00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't make it in the top three or </v>

743
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:02.440
<v Speaker 1>four?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be all.</v>

744
00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.760
<v Speaker 1>Well that's again the thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>just said like I like eating things </v>

745
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.760
<v Speaker 1>medium rare or rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where they taste the best.</v>

746
00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

747
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.570
<v Speaker 1>And so like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never put somebody down for one.</v>

748
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I love Barbie doll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You did all the time.</v>

749
00:32:13.451 --> 00:32:15.040
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

750
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:17.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a point I've always thought in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>

751
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I always thought in my head it's like </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like large mouth,</v>

752
00:32:20.471 --> 00:32:25.471
<v Speaker 1>bass fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to a restaurant and they </v>

753
00:32:25.471 --> 00:32:28.441
<v Speaker 1>have large mouth bass right next to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chilean sea bass and you pick the large </v>

754
00:32:28.441 --> 00:32:29.500
<v Speaker 1>mouth bass are kind of an outline to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

755
00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

756
00:32:30.161 --> 00:32:31.180
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

757
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.160
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't taste that good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

758
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:34.570
<v Speaker 1>It's edible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's edible.</v>

759
00:32:34.571 --> 00:32:39.571
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you took a poll because large </v>

760
00:32:39.571 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 1>mouth bass tastes bear way better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>large</v>

761
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:42.590
<v Speaker 2>mouth bass for gay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going down the track,</v>

762
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:48.070
<v Speaker 2>like large mouth bass just doesn't taste</v>
<v Speaker 2>that tastes better than large mouth </v>

763
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.070
<v Speaker 2>bass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Large mouth.</v>

764
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.710
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

765
00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so delicious.</v>

766
00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:53.880
<v Speaker 2>Fresh water fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Delicious.</v>

767
00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.270
<v Speaker 2>Go to Alaska and they're everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

768
00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:56.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

769
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

770
00:32:58.451 --> 00:33:00.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not much of a fish eater.</v>

771
00:33:00.041 --> 00:33:00.370
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>

772
00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.880
<v Speaker 2>John Barklow from Sitka was in Vegas </v>
<v Speaker 2>this past weekend and we did.</v>

773
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a great guy.</v>

774
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Him and Dave brinker were there and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was talking about how um,</v>

775
00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.860
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy to leave Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

776
00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:21.540
<v Speaker 2>but John was talking about how he </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually enjoyed a brown bear meat and I</v>

777
00:33:23.731 --> 00:33:24.480
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

778
00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:25.590
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

779
00:33:25.591 --> 00:33:27.840
<v Speaker 2>it tasted like a mule deer roast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he goes,</v>

780
00:33:27.841 --> 00:33:32.841
<v Speaker 2>I made it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave it to people at parties and he </v>

781
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:35.181
<v Speaker 2>said he put it on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he cut it up into cubes and put </v>

782
00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:38.661
<v Speaker 2>little toothpicks in it and handed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out like as hors d'oeuvres at a party </v>

783
00:33:38.661 --> 00:33:38.670
<v Speaker 2>and people are eating and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

784
00:33:38.671 --> 00:33:40.140
<v Speaker 2>this is delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

785
00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.730
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a brown bear.</v>

786
00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:45.870
<v Speaker 2>And people got mad at him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they say it's a person.</v>

787
00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:48.570
<v Speaker 2>I love that he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that he did it though.</v>

788
00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.550
<v Speaker 2>I support fully support that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

789
00:33:50.551 --> 00:33:55.551
<v Speaker 2>But I would assume that if someone like </v>
<v Speaker 2>John who works for [inaudible] is </v>

790
00:33:55.551 --> 00:33:58.440
<v Speaker 2>probably the number one hunting gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothing company in the world.</v>

791
00:33:58.441 --> 00:34:02.070
<v Speaker 2>John is a wealth of knowledge all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way through and you know,</v>

792
00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:05.010
<v Speaker 2>had a considerable amount experience in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the military.</v>

793
00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:10.250
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine the people that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>come to his house for a party would be </v>

794
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.030
<v Speaker 2>normalized to happened in La if you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you did that,</v>

795
00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.890
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go crazy.</v>

796
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be a,</v>

797
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.030
<v Speaker 2>there'd be riots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

798
00:34:16.031 --> 00:34:21.031
<v Speaker 2>You should see the look on people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>faces when my kids tell them that </v>

799
00:34:21.031 --> 00:34:22.770
<v Speaker 2>they've eaten bear because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the kids were like five and six,</v>

800
00:34:22.771 --> 00:34:24.780
<v Speaker 2>like I've eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ate a.</v>

801
00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:29.910
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have that like fierce look in </v>

802
00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:31.920
<v Speaker 2>their eyes like you just had to bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fun to freak people out.</v>

803
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:37.310
<v Speaker 2>I do like that sausage and Doris Acute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a wonderful thing coming out of </v>

804
00:34:37.741 --> 00:34:38.740
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird,</v>

805
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:39.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

806
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bear thing is a very strange one.</v>

807
00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.780
<v Speaker 2>And I um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely don't like hunting them.</v>

808
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.160
<v Speaker 2>Like I like hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anything else</v>

809
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.450
<v Speaker 4>I struggle with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I as a hunter,</v>

810
00:34:49.451 --> 00:34:51.070
<v Speaker 4>I feel like coming on and talking as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter,</v>

811
00:34:51.071 --> 00:34:53.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to like disparate disparage</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything,</v>

812
00:34:53.471 --> 00:34:56.620
<v Speaker 4>but I also just want to be 100 percent </v>
<v Speaker 4>honest about every part of it.</v>

813
00:34:56.990 --> 00:35:01.990
<v Speaker 4>And hunting is really complex activity </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I feel conflicted about it almost </v>

814
00:35:02.381 --> 00:35:04.810
<v Speaker 4>every time I go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like not about killing the enemy,</v>

815
00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:09.811
<v Speaker 4>we're hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just about little parts of what's </v>

816
00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:09.811
<v Speaker 4>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

817
00:35:09.811 --> 00:35:12.450
<v Speaker 4>and so bear hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so sometimes you just want to like </v>

818
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.430
<v Speaker 4>Rinella said this once,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I never understood it until it </v>

819
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:14.430
<v Speaker 4>happened to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

820
00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:18.180
<v Speaker 4>I just want to watch them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I don't really want to hunt </v>

821
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:18.610
<v Speaker 4>them and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what is hunting anyway.</v>

822
00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.080
<v Speaker 4>It's hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>killing or was hunting,</v>

823
00:35:20.081 --> 00:35:22.450
<v Speaker 4>getting close enough to like shake their</v>
<v Speaker 4>hand saying,</v>

824
00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.350
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the whole thing.</v>

825
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:28.590
<v Speaker 4>I think my opinion on that specific </v>
<v Speaker 4>point is one I would go back to.</v>

826
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:34.590
<v Speaker 4>I always ask myself two questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are you going and and does this </v>

827
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:39.810
<v Speaker 4>hunting benefit the place and the animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you're hunting and if I can't </v>

828
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:44.721
<v Speaker 4>answer those questions myself and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>always strip away conservation and meat </v>

829
00:35:44.721 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 4>from the first question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>will you have a very good way of looking</v>

830
00:35:47.041 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 4>at this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think is very honest.</v>

831
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:53.511
<v Speaker 4>I think this is super important is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation is essentially a side </v>

832
00:35:53.511 --> 00:35:57.741
<v Speaker 4>effect of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a byproduct and to pretend that </v>

833
00:35:57.741 --> 00:35:58.710
<v Speaker 4>it's the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like a weird.</v>

834
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:03.830
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a disingenuous approach to the </v>

835
00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.441
<v Speaker 4>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like really saying you shouldn't be </v>

836
00:36:06.441 --> 00:36:06.441
<v Speaker 4>hunting will say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

837
00:36:06.441 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 4>hunting is conservation and hunters of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the best conservationists.</v>

838
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's funny.</v>

839
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:09.840
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's not as true,</v>

840
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:11.170
<v Speaker 4>but it's not really why you're doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

841
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:16.190
<v Speaker 4>And there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the biggest point to make there </v>

842
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.190
<v Speaker 4>semantic chinks in that armor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

843
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:17.330
<v Speaker 4>We've built up over the years as </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunters.</v>

844
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.870
<v Speaker 4>They usually organic meat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation as this like armor,</v>

845
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.400
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That insulates why we go.</v>

846
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.970
<v Speaker 4>And I think there's just chinks in that </v>
<v Speaker 4>armor that if we don't recognize those </v>

847
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:29.420
<v Speaker 4>points,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially the conservation,</v>

848
00:36:29.421 --> 00:36:34.421
<v Speaker 4>when I think that's a bigger deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like conservation hunting is a tool for </v>

849
00:36:34.421 --> 00:36:38.481
<v Speaker 4>conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the same way as translocation is a </v>

850
00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:38.481
<v Speaker 4>tool conservationist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

851
00:36:38.481 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 4>you can move the animal to get them away</v>
<v Speaker 4>from a certain situation,</v>

852
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:45.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reintroduce animal fats one way or bring</v>

853
00:36:45.411 --> 00:36:48.360
<v Speaker 4>in hunters and help manage the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population that way.</v>

854
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:50.130
<v Speaker 4>But it's that first question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

855
00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:55.131
<v Speaker 4>is why do I go?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always say it's like we've had </v>

856
00:36:55.321 --> 00:37:00.321
<v Speaker 4>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you and I together in the woods that I </v>

857
00:37:00.321 --> 00:37:00.321
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we couldn't replicate anywhere else.</v>

858
00:37:00.321 --> 00:37:04.430
<v Speaker 4>Like you've done a lot of cool shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's some like when you ran down the </v>

859
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:08.541
<v Speaker 4>road after I shot my moods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there's just something about that </v>

860
00:37:08.541 --> 00:37:12.831
<v Speaker 4>for me that is way more fulfilling and </v>
<v Speaker 4>enriching to my life than any other </v>

861
00:37:12.831 --> 00:37:13.590
<v Speaker 4>thing I've experienced.</v>

862
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.400
<v Speaker 4>I haven't experienced everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but all the things that I've done well,</v>

863
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.810
<v Speaker 4>it's so primal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

864
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:21.150
<v Speaker 4>And so it's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's learning about animals.</v>

865
00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:26.260
<v Speaker 4>You're in the woods too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're also in a really almost like </v>

866
00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 4>you're a visitor in an alien world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

867
00:37:26.521 --> 00:37:28.460
<v Speaker 4>And so you learn about these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

868
00:37:28.461 --> 00:37:33.461
<v Speaker 4>you developed skills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you wouldn't develop any </v>

869
00:37:33.461 --> 00:37:34.350
<v Speaker 4>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So and on and on it goes.</v>

870
00:37:34.351 --> 00:37:39.351
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's probably a 100 reasons </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I and I discover a new one every </v>

871
00:37:39.351 --> 00:37:42.771
<v Speaker 4>time I go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I always say like that's the </v>

872
00:37:42.771 --> 00:37:42.771
<v Speaker 4>answer to the first question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do I go?</v>

873
00:37:42.771 --> 00:37:43.410
<v Speaker 4>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

874
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:45.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm real hungry and I want to control </v>
<v Speaker 4>the population.</v>

875
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware as I go hunting that the two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those two things are byproducts of my </v>

876
00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.831
<v Speaker 4>efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then they're always going to be </v>

877
00:37:54.831 --> 00:37:54.831
<v Speaker 4>byproducts of my efforts unless I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>poaching.</v>

878
00:37:54.831 --> 00:37:54.831
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

879
00:37:54.831 --> 00:37:55.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

880
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:58.290
<v Speaker 4>there is a biologist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a state wildlife biologist,</v>

881
00:37:58.291 --> 00:38:01.560
<v Speaker 4>federal biologists that determine what </v>
<v Speaker 4>tags go where,</v>

882
00:38:01.561 --> 00:38:06.561
<v Speaker 4>what animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're moving pieces of the puzzle </v>

883
00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:06.561
<v Speaker 4>around to keep this thing the way it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

884
00:38:06.561 --> 00:38:07.740
<v Speaker 4>Keep it healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep it stable,</v>

885
00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:11.880
<v Speaker 4>but they're also looking at what's the </v>
<v Speaker 4>economic impact of that all that's going</v>

886
00:38:11.881 --> 00:38:15.060
<v Speaker 4>on while I'm out there thinking I gotta </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill this big buck,</v>

887
00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:17.400
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not thinking while I'm out there</v>
<v Speaker 4>with my bow,</v>

888
00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:19.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

889
00:38:19.201 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to kill that one because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that'll really stabilize this area,</v>

890
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.100
<v Speaker 4>but I'm out there and kill that one </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I really liked backstraps.</v>

891
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:31.190
<v Speaker 4>I know those two things are happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're almost like be pulled that </v>

892
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:34.821
<v Speaker 4>away from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from what's actually going on and focus </v>

893
00:38:34.821 --> 00:38:34.821
<v Speaker 4>on why you're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

894
00:38:34.821 --> 00:38:36.050
<v Speaker 4>why don't you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did you go to Lanai?</v>

895
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.440
<v Speaker 5>Like what somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why did you go,</v>

896
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:40.540
<v Speaker 5>what would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Two reasons.</v>

897
00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:41.640
<v Speaker 5>One,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

898
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.850
<v Speaker 5>to bowhunt for me for sure because I </v>
<v Speaker 5>want her to eat access to here and two,</v>

899
00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:49.750
<v Speaker 5>because I think that it's great </v>
<v Speaker 5>practice.</v>

900
00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 5>One of the hardest things about bow </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting is just you can practice all day</v>

901
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:57.670
<v Speaker 5>on a target,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's almost like never sparring.</v>

902
00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.550
<v Speaker 5>Like you could practice all day hitting </v>
<v Speaker 5>a heavy bag,</v>

903
00:39:00.551 --> 00:39:02.750
<v Speaker 5>but you've never had hit a person.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

904
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.170
<v Speaker 5>Like once you're in front of a person,</v>
<v Speaker 5>things get weird,</v>

905
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:06.850
<v Speaker 5>but when there's a chink in the armor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

906
00:39:06.851 --> 00:39:08.320
<v Speaker 5>So you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I practice on an animal,</v>

907
00:39:08.321 --> 00:39:10.570
<v Speaker 5>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would say to that,</v>

908
00:39:10.571 --> 00:39:14.680
<v Speaker 5>like that that's just another chink in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the armor that we all know is happening.</v>

909
00:39:14.681 --> 00:39:17.050
<v Speaker 5>Like if we were conservation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so we would never pick up a bill.</v>

910
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:18.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I'm not practicing on an animal.</v>

911
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.500
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've never practiced before.</v>

912
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:26.630
<v Speaker 5>Texting maybe be in the wrong term.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's something in there that </v>

913
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:29.191
<v Speaker 5>like the experience of stalking an </v>
<v Speaker 5>animal is pretty visceral and if you've </v>

914
00:39:29.191 --> 00:39:33.091
<v Speaker 5>never done it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you shoot your back on the hell you </v>

915
00:39:33.091 --> 00:39:33.091
<v Speaker 5>want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

916
00:39:33.091 --> 00:39:35.970
<v Speaker 5>I say practice in terms of like when you</v>
<v Speaker 5>compete as a a young martial artists,</v>

917
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:41.550
<v Speaker 5>it's not really practice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it is like you're involved in </v>

918
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:45.091
<v Speaker 5>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like are you hunting or are you </v>

919
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:45.091
<v Speaker 5>practicing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>We are definitely hunting,</v>

920
00:39:45.091 --> 00:39:49.410
<v Speaker 5>but that hunting is practice for other </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunts or you don't get nearly as many </v>

921
00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:54.181
<v Speaker 5>opportunities as you do in Lanai.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Lanai is one of the best examples of a </v>

922
00:39:54.181 --> 00:39:57.040
<v Speaker 5>place that has no predators in a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem with overpopulation.</v>

923
00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:02.340
<v Speaker 5>You were with me in Dudley that one time</v>
<v Speaker 5>where me and him and his son were were </v>

924
00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:07.261
<v Speaker 5>hanging out and we were there at last </v>
<v Speaker 5>light and we were watching these access </v>

925
00:40:07.261 --> 00:40:11.770
<v Speaker 5>deer come off the mountain and we saw </v>
<v Speaker 5>how many hundreds.</v>

926
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:14.980
<v Speaker 5>I mean it might've been seven,</v>
<v Speaker 5>800 deer coming off this mountain and we</v>

927
00:40:14.981 --> 00:40:16.270
<v Speaker 5>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>

928
00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:17.890
<v Speaker 5>It was just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's 10 more,</v>

929
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.540
<v Speaker 5>there's five more,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's six more,</v>

930
00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:21.580
<v Speaker 5>there's 11 more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a herd of 20.</v>

931
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:26.730
<v Speaker 5>Like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It got to the point where like this is </v>

932
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:26.730
<v Speaker 5>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So in a place like that,</v>

933
00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:31.980
<v Speaker 5>I feel like you have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a great ethical argument for like </v>

934
00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.360
<v Speaker 5>they're going to shoot these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>period.</v>

935
00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:39.570
<v Speaker 5>And the only other way to get around it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is you bring in wolves and if you bring </v>

936
00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.050
<v Speaker 5>in wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wolves,</v>

937
00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:45.570
<v Speaker 5>and these people also have dogs running </v>
<v Speaker 5>around on the streets and like pet dogs,</v>

938
00:40:45.590 --> 00:40:50.590
<v Speaker 5>those dogs that get fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like immediately they're going to get </v>

939
00:40:50.590 --> 00:40:52.771
<v Speaker 5>killed by wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wolves want to take out all the </v>

940
00:40:52.771 --> 00:40:52.771
<v Speaker 5>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can't have wolves on the NIH.</v>

941
00:40:52.771 --> 00:40:54.390
<v Speaker 5>It's a stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's,</v>

942
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:55.750
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody is stopped.</v>

943
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:57.040
<v Speaker 5>We're never going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But.</v>

944
00:40:57.041 --> 00:41:02.041
<v Speaker 5>So it's one of it in terms of like since</v>
<v Speaker 5>since the animals are there and there's </v>

945
00:41:02.531 --> 00:41:05.650
<v Speaker 5>no talk of eradicating them because they</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a real value.</v>

946
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.080
<v Speaker 5>The people that live there live off of </v>
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>

947
00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 5>like all those folks that we were </v>
<v Speaker 5>hanging out with,</v>

948
00:41:09.941 --> 00:41:14.941
<v Speaker 5>like Romano,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the people that work at that </v>

949
00:41:14.941 --> 00:41:17.791
<v Speaker 5>place,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they eat access all the time and it is </v>

950
00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:17.791
<v Speaker 5>without a doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not an oh,</v>

951
00:41:17.791 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 5>it is the opposite of it is the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>delicious game me in the world.</v>

952
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.760
<v Speaker 5>If it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's not,</v>

953
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.760
<v Speaker 5>if it's not number one,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's number two.</v>

954
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.460
<v Speaker 5>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so good.</v>

955
00:41:30.461 --> 00:41:33.690
<v Speaker 5>Like we hated it at the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They served at a restaurant and remember</v>

956
00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 5>the burger</v>

957
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.110
<v Speaker 1>we had that one lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

958
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.170
<v Speaker 1>And then the state police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state place at that place.</v>

959
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible meaning?</v>

960
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terribly terrible.</v>

961
00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

962
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:45.950
<v Speaker 1>I can't get it out of my mind thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

963
00:41:45.951 --> 00:41:47.230
<v Speaker 1>that's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were sliders.</v>

964
00:41:47.231 --> 00:41:52.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's the restaurant serves </v>

965
00:41:52.231 --> 00:41:53.030
<v Speaker 1>tenderloin and it is phenomenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

966
00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:58.780
<v Speaker 1>So why would I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why one thing I always try to </v>

967
00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.140
<v Speaker 1>separate and I try to do it only because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I try to look at it from someone</v>

968
00:42:02.721 --> 00:42:06.950
<v Speaker 1>else who is a non hunter and is hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>us talk or hearing me talk and whatever.</v>

969
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And maybe thinking like that's a weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that.</v>

970
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's strange.</v>

971
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.660
<v Speaker 1>And so I feel like if I can say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat is delicious.</v>

972
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got to kill these things.</v>

973
00:42:16.761 --> 00:42:21.761
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The local people value the animal </v>

974
00:42:21.761 --> 00:42:21.761
<v Speaker 1>because hunters exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

975
00:42:21.761 --> 00:42:23.030
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't just gun them down because</v>

976
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.470
<v Speaker 1>hunters will pay to go out there.</v>

977
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.680
<v Speaker 1>All those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think set aside,</v>

978
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.400
<v Speaker 1>what am I there for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we were that group of hunters we </v>

979
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.150
<v Speaker 1>had in camp was probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I've hunted with a lot of awesome</v>

980
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:40.660
<v Speaker 1>talented folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was probably the most skilled group of </v>

981
00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:41.140
<v Speaker 1>hunters I've ever been around when </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about who we have.</v>

982
00:42:41.141 --> 00:42:44.270
<v Speaker 1>We have John Dudley is arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the best bowhunter in the world.</v>

983
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He's in the top three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's like,</v>

984
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's like top four,</v>

985
00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.420
<v Speaker 1>like John Kamm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remy and uh,</v>

986
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:53.050
<v Speaker 1>Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam Green Tree.</v>

987
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might be all the people that funded</v>

988
00:42:54.771 --> 00:42:56.030
<v Speaker 1>with that top four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

989
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:59.300
<v Speaker 1>I think they might be the top four in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and if they're not top four,</v>

990
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:03.500
<v Speaker 1>they're all during the top 10 cs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think you're better,</v>

991
00:43:03.501 --> 00:43:05.180
<v Speaker 1>come see us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A clan of killers.</v>

992
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got Shane Dorian is a </v>

993
00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:12.761
<v Speaker 1>great bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred two and it's a big wave surfer </v>

994
00:43:12.761 --> 00:43:12.761
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

995
00:43:12.761 --> 00:43:13.010
<v Speaker 1>Say about Shane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's fanatical,</v>

996
00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:14.660
<v Speaker 1>like he would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

997
00:43:14.661 --> 00:43:19.661
<v Speaker 1>Hey Shane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to let go take a break and get </v>

998
00:43:19.661 --> 00:43:19.661
<v Speaker 1>a sandwich?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he'd looked at me like,</v>

999
00:43:19.661 --> 00:43:19.700
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1000
00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.270
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1001
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:22.130
<v Speaker 1>we can be hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would we be eating sandwiches?</v>

1002
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:24.100
<v Speaker 1>He was out there all day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day,</v>

1003
00:43:24.101 --> 00:43:29.101
<v Speaker 1>all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he didn't come in during lunchtime </v>

1004
00:43:29.101 --> 00:43:29.660
<v Speaker 1>when everybody else was in [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 95 degrees outside.</v>

1005
00:43:29.661 --> 00:43:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's out there on his hands and knees,</v>

1006
00:43:31.251 --> 00:43:32.980
<v Speaker 1>crawling bushes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crawling,</v>

1007
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:37.910
<v Speaker 1>hoping to find one slip and this girl </v>
<v Speaker 1>just forever to crawl it for me.</v>

1008
00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:42.911
<v Speaker 1>Like one reason to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stripping away all the things that I </v>

1009
00:43:42.911 --> 00:43:47.051
<v Speaker 1>know to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right in my own mind was that was those </v>

1010
00:43:47.051 --> 00:43:47.730
<v Speaker 1>people getting them all together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1011
00:43:47.731 --> 00:43:50.720
<v Speaker 1>and then like meat and Roman and me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brandon and meet Alec.</v>

1012
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:52.820
<v Speaker 1>All our guides and all the locals that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were there,</v>

1013
00:43:52.821 --> 00:43:57.821
<v Speaker 1>like there's things I and I learned more</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the quick twitch muscle and the </v>

1014
00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.820
<v Speaker 1>gut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear.</v>

1015
00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.350
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Than I've ever learned.</v>

1016
00:44:00.351 --> 00:44:03.470
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like I've learned something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent time with these people that made</v>

1017
00:44:03.471 --> 00:44:05.900
<v Speaker 1>me better at not just hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything.</v>

1018
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Well for people who've never been around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and access to hear before they evolved </v>

1019
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 1>with tigers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tigers hunt them.</v>

1020
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have never seen an animal more fast </v>

1021
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:17.300
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the one deer that we shot?</v>

1022
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:19.670
<v Speaker 1>I shot this deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was 60 yards away.</v>

1023
00:44:19.671 --> 00:44:22.400
<v Speaker 1>It was looking at me and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to shoot it.</v>

1024
00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:25.280
<v Speaker 1>It's just standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time I got there,</v>

1025
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:28.280
<v Speaker 1>it was four or five deer away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was swimming to Maui.</v>

1026
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.370
<v Speaker 1>It was at a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It build a boat and it was over 60</v>

1027
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:37.370
<v Speaker 2>yards away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The arrows going 275 feet a second and </v>

1028
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:39.720
<v Speaker 2>it was nowhere near it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time it got there.</v>

1029
00:44:39.721 --> 00:44:41.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please,</v>

1030
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.800
<v Speaker 2>there's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're fascinating.</v>

1031
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Any animal I've ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1032
00:44:45.121 --> 00:44:50.121
<v Speaker 2>would that lets you say like what a </v>
<v Speaker 2>weird scenario to be hunting an animal </v>

1033
00:44:50.121 --> 00:44:51.160
<v Speaker 2>that has been trained by tigers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>avoid.</v>

1034
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:53.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what a weird thing.</v>

1035
00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:54.930
<v Speaker 2>So like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my appreciation.</v>

1036
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.060
<v Speaker 2>That little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little exchange of,</v>

1037
00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:59.040
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and tigers both hunted this thing,</v>

1038
00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.290
<v Speaker 2>like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something cool to me,</v>

1039
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's outside of this thing.</v>

1040
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:05.610
<v Speaker 2>So talking about that all day with it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the meat.</v>

1041
00:45:05.611 --> 00:45:10.611
<v Speaker 2>Look if you're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a person who values animal </v>

1042
00:45:10.611 --> 00:45:13.521
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like ethically sourced animal </v>

1043
00:45:13.521 --> 00:45:14.180
<v Speaker 2>protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no better way to get it than,</v>

1044
00:45:14.210 --> 00:45:17.400
<v Speaker 2>than like a place like Lanai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the pieces are in check.</v>

1045
00:45:17.401 --> 00:45:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Do they need to kill them?</v>

1046
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there an overpopulation problem?</v>

1047
00:45:20.341 --> 00:45:21.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Provide jobs for local.</v>

1048
00:45:21.851 --> 00:45:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1049
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the good things.</v>

1050
00:45:23.521 --> 00:45:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of positive sides </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1051
00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

1052
00:45:27.031 --> 00:45:28.890
<v Speaker 2>if you're someone who enjoys bowhunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1053
00:45:29.070 --> 00:45:34.070
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an uncomfortable thing for some </v>

1054
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:34.070
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I enjoy it.</v>

1055
00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like getting my meat that way.</v>

1056
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad if I get bacon from a store.</v>

1057
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:43.071
<v Speaker 2>I feel like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are we talking about like a as </v>

1058
00:45:43.071 --> 00:45:43.071
<v Speaker 2>predators,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we are predators.</v>

1059
00:45:43.071 --> 00:45:43.071
<v Speaker 2>If you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1060
00:45:43.071 --> 00:45:45.450
<v Speaker 2>it's been millions of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been killing eating things.</v>

1061
00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.870
<v Speaker 2>New humans are herbivores and that's all</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lie.</v>

1062
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done some reading and Predator.</v>

1063
00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.290
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't have to be a predator.</v>

1064
00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.450
<v Speaker 5>You could live off of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but aren't we though we up.</v>

1065
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:56.920
<v Speaker 5>Some people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

1066
00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.770
<v Speaker 5>you can live by point is if you want it </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

1067
00:45:58.771 --> 00:46:00.750
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to disparage away anybody </v>
<v Speaker 5>lives there live.</v>

1068
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 5>You could live off of just pure </v>
<v Speaker 5>vegetables.</v>

1069
00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:08.360
<v Speaker 5>You could live off it and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a real moral and ethical </v>

1070
00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.881
<v Speaker 5>argument if you are a Vegan to eat </v>
<v Speaker 5>mollusks folks because monologues are </v>

1071
00:46:11.971 --> 00:46:16.320
<v Speaker 5>more primitive than most plants.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't communicate as much as plants</v>

1072
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:18.960
<v Speaker 5>do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They don't have any sense of feeling.</v>

1073
00:46:18.961 --> 00:46:22.380
<v Speaker 5>They have no nerve endings that would </v>
<v Speaker 5>allow them to feel pain.</v>

1074
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 5>They're incredibly simple organisms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only thing that we have against them</v>

1075
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:31.290
<v Speaker 5>in terms of like when we think about </v>
<v Speaker 5>them as being an animal versus a,</v>

1076
00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:32.700
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a plant.</v>

1077
00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 5>People think eating a plant is cruelty </v>
<v Speaker 5>free.</v>

1078
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:38.190
<v Speaker 5>Eating a mollusk you're killing a living</v>
<v Speaker 5>creature.</v>

1079
00:46:38.191 --> 00:46:40.320
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's just because they move.</v>

1080
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:44.340
<v Speaker 5>But a fucking Venus flytrap moves to and</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's probably 10 times smarter than like</v>

1081
00:46:44.341 --> 00:46:46.710
<v Speaker 5>a scallop.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like they're not smart.</v>

1082
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:49.100
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to regulate that morality.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>

1083
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.030
<v Speaker 5>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I mean I just want people,</v>

1084
00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:56.570
<v Speaker 5>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're uncomfortable with eating </v>

1085
00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:56.570
<v Speaker 5>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I get it,</v>

1086
00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:58.830
<v Speaker 5>but clams and oysters and those things </v>
<v Speaker 5>are good for you.</v>

1087
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.640
<v Speaker 5>They really are and it's sustainable and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1088
00:47:02.641 --> 00:47:07.641
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the animals themselves are not feeling </v>

1089
00:47:07.641 --> 00:47:07.641
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>

1090
00:47:07.641 --> 00:47:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moral entanglements of all of it is </v>

1091
00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:10.460
<v Speaker 2>just like we say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1092
00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.680
<v Speaker 2>we humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wake up in the morning and you </v>

1093
00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:14.680
<v Speaker 2>consume everything like you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming.</v>

1094
00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.170
<v Speaker 2>You breathe there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pump out CEO too.</v>

1095
00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:19.500
<v Speaker 2>I mean every other animal does too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just wander around on the grass and</v>

1096
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:24.590
<v Speaker 2>consumption engines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like for us to to separate out </v>

1097
00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.330
<v Speaker 2>one part of our consumption and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>beat the crap out of it.</v>

1098
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Even though we've been doing it for 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million years is in and of itself kind </v>

1099
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:32.510
<v Speaker 2>of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1100
00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:34.000
<v Speaker 2>you know what I think happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is your mic on?</v>

1101
00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.020
<v Speaker 2>That was a weird story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loud was weird.</v>

1102
00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.200
<v Speaker 2>It was like it was in my ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Davies,</v>

1103
00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.660
<v Speaker 2>Davies on the ride there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're getting crazy,</v>

1104
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:48.760
<v Speaker 2>but I think part of the issue is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people over the last hundred years or so</v>

1105
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:53.761
<v Speaker 2>have been so removed from where the meat</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from that when they can find a </v>

1106
00:47:54.011 --> 00:47:55.630
<v Speaker 2>direct connection like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1107
00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.690
<v Speaker 2>you went and you shot a moose and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>you ate that move.</v>

1108
00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:00.280
<v Speaker 2>So like you were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you killed the Moose.</v>

1109
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:02.740
<v Speaker 2>Like you didn't have to kill that Moose </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1110
00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:07.530
<v Speaker 2>That becomes problematic because people </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't used to someone killing things.</v>

1111
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that they know in particular know</v>

1112
00:48:09.611 --> 00:48:12.250
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I enjoy the ideological conversation.</v>

1113
00:48:12.251 --> 00:48:14.020
<v Speaker 2>I just enjoy the conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1114
00:48:14.021 --> 00:48:16.840
<v Speaker 2>Like I enjoy it because I think it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of a human condition.</v>

1115
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:19.120
<v Speaker 2>It's part of who we are and what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

1116
00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:24.121
<v Speaker 2>we should probably fight about it a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit and disagree because it's </v>

1117
00:48:24.121 --> 00:48:26.491
<v Speaker 2>pretty damn important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is an important piece of our </v>

1118
00:48:26.491 --> 00:48:26.491
<v Speaker 2>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

1119
00:48:26.491 --> 00:48:26.491
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

1120
00:48:26.491 --> 00:48:31.260
<v Speaker 2>I feel very strongly that hunting is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the essence of who I am as a human </v>

1121
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:35.371
<v Speaker 2>and has made my life better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I can see how somebody else would </v>

1122
00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:35.740
<v Speaker 2>say that's you're killing stuff I can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1123
00:48:35.741 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 2>And I also think that those people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

1124
00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:42.590
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think having vegans and having animal </v>

1125
00:48:42.590 --> 00:48:43.150
<v Speaker 2>rights activists and having to be able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have dialogue with them,</v>

1126
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:47.890
<v Speaker 2>it also makes sure that you keep people </v>
<v Speaker 2>honest,</v>

1127
00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:50.650
<v Speaker 2>like people that are hunters like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1128
00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.620
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we all know unethical people.</v>

1129
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:55.780
<v Speaker 2>There's people that are unethical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1130
00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:57.940
<v Speaker 2>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think about it,</v>

1131
00:48:57.941 --> 00:49:02.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the trend of hunting and </v>

1132
00:49:02.941 --> 00:49:03.790
<v Speaker 2>the seventies hunting was doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the eighties started to tick</v>

1133
00:49:03.791 --> 00:49:05.430
<v Speaker 2>down fucking Bambi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what happened.</v>

1134
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.340
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I would say three.</v>

1135
00:49:06.341 --> 00:49:06.690
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1136
00:49:06.850 --> 00:49:08.500
<v Speaker 2>we talked about this before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three things.</v>

1137
00:49:08.501 --> 00:49:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Bambi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe Walt Disney.</v>

1138
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:11.830
<v Speaker 2>He was maybe a Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1139
00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:15.400
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then urbanization,</v>

1140
00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:20.860
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which correlated with the client and </v>

1141
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:20.860
<v Speaker 2>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then hunters being the third one.</v>

1142
00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:25.830
<v Speaker 2>Messaging we have a bad were bad pr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them are bad pr agents and </v>

1143
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:27.190
<v Speaker 2>people like Rinella that are amazing at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1144
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:32.250
<v Speaker 2>We're way better now than we were five </v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago with better tomorrow than we </v>

1145
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:32.650
<v Speaker 2>were yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think like in general,</v>

1146
00:49:32.651 --> 00:49:34.810
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at that line graph </v>
<v Speaker 2>right in the seventies,</v>

1147
00:49:34.811 --> 00:49:39.811
<v Speaker 2>it was going nicely in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started to decline and I think 2011 </v>

1148
00:49:39.811 --> 00:49:40.630
<v Speaker 2>was the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually went up.</v>

1149
00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:45.890
<v Speaker 2>A real number of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the licensed sales or </v>

1150
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:45.890
<v Speaker 2>number of hunters participating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what caused the.</v>

1151
00:49:45.890 --> 00:49:49.180
<v Speaker 2>That's like the organic food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a study that said locavores,</v>

1152
00:49:49.181 --> 00:49:54.181
<v Speaker 2>they're talking about more women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They talked about returning military </v>

1153
00:49:54.181 --> 00:49:56.851
<v Speaker 2>members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm around remembering reading the </v>

1154
00:49:56.851 --> 00:49:56.851
<v Speaker 2>study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think those are the top three.</v>

1155
00:49:56.851 --> 00:50:00.751
<v Speaker 2>But I think local Var was probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed out there as like the way to </v>

1156
00:50:00.751 --> 00:50:04.111
<v Speaker 2>reverse that second point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way to reverse the suburban and </v>

1157
00:50:04.111 --> 00:50:07.291
<v Speaker 2>urban rise was to take that suburban a </v>
<v Speaker 2>male or female and say you can get your </v>

1158
00:50:08.771 --> 00:50:11.920
<v Speaker 2>food right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's a way to kind of reverse</v>

1159
00:50:11.921 --> 00:50:16.921
<v Speaker 2>the decline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's probably what was </v>

1160
00:50:16.921 --> 00:50:18.730
<v Speaker 2>happening that well everybody wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go with locally sourced,</v>

1161
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:23.731
<v Speaker 2>locally raised grass fed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are trying to go to farmers </v>

1162
00:50:23.731 --> 00:50:25.930
<v Speaker 2>markets and connect with the people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are actually growing the animals.</v>

1163
00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 2>And this is like one step better than</v>

1164
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:33.130
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of having an animal that's in </v>

1165
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:33.130
<v Speaker 5>captivity,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go out into the forest.</v>

1166
00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:34.490
<v Speaker 5>But there's a rude awakening for a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of these people that think they're going</v>

1167
00:50:34.491 --> 00:50:39.491
<v Speaker 5>to just go ahead and try it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it is not easy by any stretch of </v>

1168
00:50:39.491 --> 00:50:39.491
<v Speaker 5>the imagination.</v>

1169
00:50:39.491 --> 00:50:41.970
<v Speaker 4>The other problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the Grand Canyon being I would love</v>

1170
00:50:41.971 --> 00:50:46.971
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to procure my own elk meat </v>

1171
00:50:46.971 --> 00:50:47.540
<v Speaker 4>and killing an elk is like being on two </v>
<v Speaker 4>sides of the Grand Canyon.</v>

1172
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no bridge to be built there.</v>

1173
00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:54.740
<v Speaker 4>You got to take it one step at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for most people that's just not the </v>

1174
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:54.930
<v Speaker 4>time for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have the want to do that.</v>

1175
00:50:55.170 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Speaker 4>So I would say it was there like 14 </v>
<v Speaker 4>million hunters in the world or </v>

1176
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:00.170
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or in the.</v>

1177
00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:01.890
<v Speaker 4>In our country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many,</v>

1178
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:03.170
<v Speaker 4>how many?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Non Hundreds.</v>

1179
00:51:03.171 --> 00:51:06.080
<v Speaker 4>You don't either have the wherewithal to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be,</v>

1180
00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:11.140
<v Speaker 4>to get educated or want to or just don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>fall into the anti on her side,</v>

1181
00:51:11.191 --> 00:51:14.730
<v Speaker 4>like the agnostic crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many of those are there out there?</v>

1182
00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:20.590
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's hundreds of millions of people </v>

1183
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:20.590
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1184
00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:20.590
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of them.</v>

1185
00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:25.810
<v Speaker 5>Urbanization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the things it's done just just </v>

1186
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:25.810
<v Speaker 5>careers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>careers in cities.</v>

1187
00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:30.251
<v Speaker 5>It's eliminated almost all of your free </v>
<v Speaker 5>time and if you wanted to go out and </v>

1188
00:51:30.321 --> 00:51:31.580
<v Speaker 5>procure your own meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first of all,</v>

1189
00:51:31.581 --> 00:51:34.580
<v Speaker 5>if you want to do with a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's going to take a tremendous amount</v>

1190
00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:36.470
<v Speaker 5>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you want to do it with a bow,</v>

1191
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:40.490
<v Speaker 5>so multiply that by a factor of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe five or 10,</v>

1192
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.520
<v Speaker 5>maybe 10,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 is probably pretty honest,</v>

1193
00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:45.800
<v Speaker 4>honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then you're talking about one of the</v>

1194
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:47.650
<v Speaker 4>hardest pieces is access,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1195
00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:52.740
<v Speaker 4>So even if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you get with John Dudley and you </v>

1196
00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.280
<v Speaker 4>learn how to be a great archer and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand that in your suburban area,</v>

1197
00:51:55.281 --> 00:51:57.710
<v Speaker 4>there are some places where there's deer</v>
<v Speaker 4>that you may kill.</v>

1198
00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.860
<v Speaker 4>You got to get access to those places </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then when you're done with that,</v>

1199
00:52:00.861 --> 00:52:05.861
<v Speaker 4>you've got to figure out a way to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>that thing from dead deer to meet and </v>

1200
00:52:05.861 --> 00:52:06.920
<v Speaker 4>all the other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is just so complex.</v>

1201
00:52:06.921 --> 00:52:09.000
<v Speaker 4>How would you ever expect somebody just </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be,</v>

1202
00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.210
<v Speaker 4>have like a desire?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were like that at some point.</v>

1203
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:16.670
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rinella opened the door for me to have </v>

1204
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:20.370
<v Speaker 5>that super lucky forever grateful </v>
<v Speaker 5>because when he took me into a wild back</v>

1205
00:52:21.601 --> 00:52:22.800
<v Speaker 5>country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Montana.</v>

1206
00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.240
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you got gear in the nuts.</v>

1207
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:29.530
<v Speaker 5>The first year there was a breaks in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>Missouri breaks in October nine degrees </v>

1208
00:52:29.611 --> 00:52:34.611
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Freezing your dick off every night in a </v>

1209
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:34.611
<v Speaker 5>tent,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it like lifeless,</v>

1210
00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:38.321
<v Speaker 5>Steven Ella.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's kind of what it's like and that </v>

1211
00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:38.321
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He loves suffering.</v>

1212
00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:38.321
<v Speaker 5>He loves it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I love that he loves it.</v>

1213
00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:39.660
<v Speaker 5>He's legit as they come.</v>

1214
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:41.710
<v Speaker 4>He really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's it,</v>

1215
00:52:41.711 --> 00:52:43.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is just this,</v>

1216
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:47.800
<v Speaker 4>there's this big gap and my father got </v>
<v Speaker 4>me into it but my brother doesn't.</v>

1217
00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:53.050
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't hunt and.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think he has a respect for it and </v>

1218
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:53.050
<v Speaker 4>understands what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he just,</v>

1219
00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:54.430
<v Speaker 4>I think at the time that I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>introduced to hunting,</v>

1220
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:59.670
<v Speaker 4>my brother was more interested in going </v>
<v Speaker 4>out with his friends and Saturday </v>

1221
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:02.761
<v Speaker 4>mornings were not for getting up early </v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we're essentially the same </v>

1222
00:53:02.761 --> 00:53:06.601
<v Speaker 4>person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I just went this way and he didn't </v>

1223
00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:06.601
<v Speaker 4>go that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1224
00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:06.880
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird.</v>

1225
00:53:06.881 --> 00:53:10.450
<v Speaker 4>So you could be in the same house with </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody in a different way.</v>

1226
00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:15.700
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Rinella has a real good way of looking </v>

1227
00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:15.700
<v Speaker 5>at it too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

1228
00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:18.091
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't expect people to go out and get </v>

1229
00:53:18.091 --> 00:53:20.021
<v Speaker 5>rid of their own sewage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why should I expect them to go out and </v>

1230
00:53:20.021 --> 00:53:20.540
<v Speaker 5>hunt their own food like you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 5>to?</v>

1231
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:21.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's,</v>

1232
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:22.840
<v Speaker 4>I think he probably said this at some </v>
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>

1233
00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:25.150
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or somebody smart did.</v>

1234
00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:28.050
<v Speaker 4>It was like I choose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

1235
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:33.051
<v Speaker 4>that I choosed to meet to be the one </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing that I grabbed ahold of to bring </v>

1236
00:53:33.051 --> 00:53:33.690
<v Speaker 4>into my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to my skill set.</v>

1237
00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:36.060
<v Speaker 4>I don't knit my own clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1238
00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.450
<v Speaker 4>I don't make my own shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't build my own houses.</v>

1239
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:44.870
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were just looking at some </v>

1240
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.870
<v Speaker 4>construction stuff a little bit earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1241
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.870
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I what?</v>

1242
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:45.300
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are they doing?</v>

1243
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 4>What are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1244
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:51.860
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just picked this one thing because </v>

1245
00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:53.040
<v Speaker 4>it's also part of my passion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you couldn't just ask someone who's a</v>

1246
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.460
<v Speaker 4>construction worker to go like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go hunt,</v>

1247
00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:59.190
<v Speaker 4>get some mate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know you have a desire for that.</v>

1248
00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:04.191
<v Speaker 4>So that's just another hard part about </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting and nonhunters by proxy are </v>

1249
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:09.231
<v Speaker 4>essential to hunting always in industry </v>
<v Speaker 4>and opinion and because we could </v>

1250
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:14.751
<v Speaker 4>legislate ourselves out of being able to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt that can happen is a privileged </v>

1251
00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:16.780
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a right and a lot of ways and</v>

1252
00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.020
<v Speaker 4>so that's another whole nother can of </v>
<v Speaker 4>worms,</v>

1253
00:54:19.021 --> 00:54:20.880
<v Speaker 4>but it could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could go away.</v>

1254
00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.300
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the.</v>

1255
00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:26.800
<v Speaker 5>The issue is that so many people are </v>
<v Speaker 5>opposed to it because they're so removed</v>

1256
00:54:26.801 --> 00:54:31.801
<v Speaker 5>from the realities of the wild and they </v>
<v Speaker 5>just feel some sort of moral superiority</v>

1257
00:54:31.871 --> 00:54:35.590
<v Speaker 5>by either not eating meat entirely or by</v>
<v Speaker 5>not killing their own meat.</v>

1258
00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:37.930
<v Speaker 5>The not killing their own meat is really</v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>

1259
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:40.120
<v Speaker 5>Like my wife was having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 5>with someone,</v>

1260
00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.980
<v Speaker 5>they were out to dinner with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 5>people while I was on an elk hunt in the</v>

1261
00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:49.981
<v Speaker 5>guy was eating a steak guy from England </v>
<v Speaker 5>in England and all hunt or they've do </v>

1262
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:51.910
<v Speaker 5>hunting foxes and horses and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they were like,</v>

1263
00:54:51.911 --> 00:54:56.440
<v Speaker 5>tweed pussies England.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We love you guys carving a steak.</v>

1264
00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:57.700
<v Speaker 5>And my wife goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1265
00:54:57.730 --> 00:55:00.280
<v Speaker 5>he's actually out elk hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the guy goes,</v>

1266
00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:02.110
<v Speaker 5>he hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's deplorable.</v>

1267
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:07.230
<v Speaker 5>The guy said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>does deplorable while he's carving a </v>

1268
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:07.230
<v Speaker 5>steak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was saying something the other day</v>

1269
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:08.780
<v Speaker 4>and I got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got a lot of,</v>

1270
00:55:08.781 --> 00:55:11.120
<v Speaker 4>like people were looking at me like I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was weird at work.</v>

1271
00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:13.010
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of my buddies that work was eating a</v>

1272
00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:18.070
<v Speaker 4>chicken sandwich from chick filet and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>look in the bag and there's a cartoon </v>

1273
00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:19.520
<v Speaker 4>chicken on the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in my mind I'm like,</v>

1274
00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:24.540
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like building a swimming pool by </v>

1275
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.351
<v Speaker 4>the lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking weird irony that that </v>

1276
00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:26.351
<v Speaker 4>were like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1277
00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:28.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm eating the chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's a cartoon version of it so we</v>

1278
00:55:28.461 --> 00:55:32.000
<v Speaker 4>can celebrate the fact that we just </v>
<v Speaker 4>murdered this chicken and we fried it up</v>

1279
00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:37.130
<v Speaker 4>like that doesn't make sense like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>swimming pool with a lake as smart </v>

1280
00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:40.691
<v Speaker 4>because it's Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the braids wearing all the time for a </v>

1281
00:55:40.691 --> 00:55:44.050
<v Speaker 4>refill and it is weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>

1282
00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:44.570
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1283
00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:45.240
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we.</v>

1284
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:48.930
<v Speaker 5>We definitely like to cartoon eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These weird.</v>

1285
00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.930
<v Speaker 4>Is that a word?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not really cartoon.</v>

1286
00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.720
<v Speaker 4>Personalize.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

1287
00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.190
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anthropomorphize.</v>

1288
00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.350
<v Speaker 5>As you take an animal and you give it </v>
<v Speaker 5>human characteristics personify.</v>

1289
00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:00.080
<v Speaker 5>No cartoon of vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that a word?</v>

1290
00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:03.530
<v Speaker 5>Just turning it into a fucking cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Green drinks.</v>

1291
00:56:03.531 --> 00:56:08.531
<v Speaker 5>We'll do what we want.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A sweet little cutie pie when really a </v>

1292
00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:11.171
<v Speaker 5>chicken is a ruthless little fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>dinosaur that lays eggs for you </v>

1293
00:56:11.171 --> 00:56:11.171
<v Speaker 5>everyday,</v>

1294
00:56:11.171 --> 00:56:15.160
<v Speaker 4>but it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it weird to be eating a chicken and </v>

1295
00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:16.880
<v Speaker 4>like there is where that chicken came </v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

1296
00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:18.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a picture of the chicken.</v>

1297
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.520
<v Speaker 4>So it kind of a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>seems like a weird way to handle it.</v>

1298
00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is weird,</v>

1299
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.100
<v Speaker 4>but we liked</v>

1300
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.140
<v Speaker 1>cartoons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love cartoons.</v>

1301
00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Well that's like the personification of </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals I think is part of the bear </v>

1302
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:34.651
<v Speaker 1>situation because my kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son is nine months old and from </v>

1303
00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:39.750
<v Speaker 1>before he was born until now there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>cartoon bears everywhere and there's </v>

1304
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:40.560
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1305
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:46.470
<v Speaker 1>personification of these cute little </v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures that come along with being a </v>

1306
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:49.150
<v Speaker 1>little baby and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you look at so many a pixar and</v>

1307
00:56:49.151 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 1>dreamworks films at like personify </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

1308
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1309
00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.540
<v Speaker 1>there's some indoctrination into that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1310
00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:56.200
<v Speaker 1>There has to be.</v>

1311
00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.440
<v Speaker 2>There is because in those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those magazines or rather those movies </v>

1312
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:05.251
<v Speaker 2>and books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even those animals will never like </v>

1313
00:57:05.251 --> 00:57:07.890
<v Speaker 2>eating each other to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>

1314
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:10.450
<v Speaker 2>if like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

1315
00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 2>if he killed a hiker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1316
00:57:14.171 --> 00:57:19.171
<v Speaker 2>if a hike or fucked up on one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>episodes of yellowstone and just took a </v>

1317
00:57:19.171 --> 00:57:24.061
<v Speaker 2>wrong turn and Yogis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like eating his rib was bunch of people </v>

1318
00:57:24.061 --> 00:57:29.041
<v Speaker 2>show up and bear and yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just going at it and ripping it </v>

1319
00:57:29.041 --> 00:57:29.041
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eating cubs.</v>

1320
00:57:29.041 --> 00:57:33.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eating some dude asshole first boys </v>

1321
00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.250
<v Speaker 2>screaming and swatting at it with his </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking hiking in their plant,</v>

1322
00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.660
<v Speaker 2>in the circle of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the background.</v>

1323
00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:38.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Go.</v>

1324
00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this.</v>

1325
00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:45.220
<v Speaker 1>I feel like there's some indoctrination </v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe maybe that's what happens.</v>

1326
00:57:45.221 --> 00:57:50.221
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea why bears get this thing </v>

1327
00:57:50.221 --> 00:57:53.461
<v Speaker 1>because bears are around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there aren't barriers </v>

1328
00:57:53.461 --> 00:57:53.461
<v Speaker 1>around there in almost all states aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>they?</v>

1329
00:57:53.461 --> 00:57:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1330
00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:56.060
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's what it is is people that don't</v>

1331
00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:59.230
<v Speaker 2>experience them firsthand and when they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do experience a firsthand,</v>

1332
00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:03.560
<v Speaker 2>usually they're in their car like local </v>
<v Speaker 2>bear and they drive by Tommy</v>

1333
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:05.620
<v Speaker 1>that one bear that was walking on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tight legs.</v>

1334
00:58:05.621 --> 00:58:06.340
<v Speaker 1>And that was cute.</v>

1335
00:58:06.810 --> 00:58:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one that had a broken front paws </v>

1336
00:58:11.810 --> 00:58:13.631
<v Speaker 2>with friends with that bear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They called them like pedals or </v>

1337
00:58:13.631 --> 00:58:13.850
<v Speaker 2>something like that is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was um,</v>

1338
00:58:14.070 --> 00:58:19.070
<v Speaker 2>my friend Tommy who lives in Connecticut</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent me a picture of these bears that </v>

1339
00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:22.860
<v Speaker 2>were in the middle of the street duking </v>
<v Speaker 2>it out in Connecticut.</v>

1340
00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Like they're invading Connecticut now </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they don't have any pressure.</v>

1341
00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:30.000
<v Speaker 2>So here's the thing about bear hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to anything else,</v>

1342
00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:35.360
<v Speaker 2>like California is weird in that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't hunt mountain lions.</v>

1343
00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:40.500
<v Speaker 2>But what's good about that is California</v>
<v Speaker 2>has very little deer now.</v>

1344
00:58:40.501 --> 00:58:44.250
<v Speaker 2>It's not good if you like to hunt deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is good if you like to drive down</v>

1345
00:58:44.251 --> 00:58:46.290
<v Speaker 2>the street and not slamming a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>deer.</v>

1346
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:51.150
<v Speaker 2>Like Iowa doesn't have mountain lions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do have a shit ton of deer.</v>

1347
00:58:51.151 --> 00:58:52.980
<v Speaker 2>And when you drive late at night in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowa,</v>

1348
00:58:53.210 --> 00:58:57.180
<v Speaker 2>you got to have your foot on the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're ready to hit that fucking break at</v>

1349
00:58:57.181 --> 00:58:59.310
<v Speaker 2>any second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just get that ranch hand guard garden.</v>

1350
00:58:59.550 --> 00:59:04.550
<v Speaker 2>He's mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Max Grill people like everywhere you </v>

1351
00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:05.630
<v Speaker 2>look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like Iowa and Montana,</v>

1352
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:10.080
<v Speaker 2>these people have pickup trucks with </v>
<v Speaker 2>these battering ram front grill.</v>

1353
00:59:10.081 --> 00:59:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Things that they should I</v>

1354
00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:12.350
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kill on alumni.</v>

1355
00:59:12.351 --> 00:59:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Were you in any of the deer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1356
00:59:14.231 --> 00:59:16.940
<v Speaker 1>we must've hit a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1357
00:59:16.941 --> 00:59:21.941
<v Speaker 1>with the Brandon's truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we hit at least two or three </v>

1358
00:59:21.941 --> 00:59:21.941
<v Speaker 1>deer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you?</v>

1359
00:59:21.941 --> 00:59:21.941
<v Speaker 1>While we run the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1360
00:59:21.941 --> 00:59:26.010
<v Speaker 1>we were there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any romanza better driver than Brian </v>

1361
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:26.010
<v Speaker 1>must be this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

1362
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:27.800
<v Speaker 1>And if you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never handled tenant to.</v>

1363
00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:29.170
<v Speaker 1>We didn't even hit one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1364
00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.510
<v Speaker 1>we hit multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were telling me about them.</v>

1365
00:59:31.540 --> 00:59:32.930
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just slamming,</v>

1366
00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:39.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the insurance industry would </v>

1367
00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.441
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy will in Cape Town last year</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy died because a guy in front of him</v>

1368
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:47.411
<v Speaker 1>hit a deer and the deer flew through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>air and went through his windshield and </v>

1369
00:59:47.411 --> 00:59:49.660
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dumb luck.</v>

1370
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:53.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a shit luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a longer term story like that you</v>

1371
00:59:53.881 --> 00:59:56.150
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have liked to hear that.</v>

1372
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:58.160
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have done duck as a pussy.</v>

1373
00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.400
<v Speaker 1>I'd have been like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1374
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:03.190
<v Speaker 1>stupid shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1375
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:07.640
<v Speaker 1>I would have been driving my car and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have seen this deer flying through</v>

1376
01:00:07.641 --> 01:00:08.240
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1377
01:00:08.241 --> 01:00:09.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a good run.</v>

1378
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing I can do about it.</v>

1379
01:00:14.241 --> 01:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>It's been a good time and airborne dear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just bad luck.</v>

1380
01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>The 150 pound blacktail yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Through the air.</v>

1381
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>What the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antlers and hooves I'd have been like,</v>

1382
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:29.830
<v Speaker 1>well it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived all these years without this </v>

1383
01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:29.830
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was lucky.</v>

1384
01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:31.100
<v Speaker 1>That's probably more lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1385
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1386
01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1387
01:00:33.051 --> 01:00:38.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to like break down those </v>

1388
01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:38.051
<v Speaker 1>things like more animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less animals,</v>

1389
01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>the value of them and all these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a complex freaking thing to have to</v>

1390
01:00:41.631 --> 01:00:44.570
<v Speaker 1>figure out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always just get more.</v>

1391
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>You read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you jump in,</v>

1392
01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>the more you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1393
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:50.840
<v Speaker 1>going to New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into,</v>

1394
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>in the northwest territories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going in Nepal,</v>

1395
01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:57.941
<v Speaker 1>you go to these places and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that everybody has the same </v>

1396
01:00:57.941 --> 01:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>essential problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how do we cohabitate,</v>

1397
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:06.010
<v Speaker 1>how do we live with these things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we were in some ways meant to </v>

1398
01:01:06.010 --> 01:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>consume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's evidence of 2 million years</v>

1399
01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:12.311
<v Speaker 1>ago in Tanzania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human's early humans hunting and so </v>

1400
01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:19.220
<v Speaker 1>100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations of people have a sense have </v>

1401
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>lived on the hunter gatherer diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1402
01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Then you had the industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple generations of people kind of </v>

1403
01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>were introduced to a new diet and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last couple of generations you have </v>

1404
01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.090
<v Speaker 1>processed foods and so you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere that I've ever been,</v>

1405
01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>you find people are struggling with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1406
01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's just not us in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1407
01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>but when you can exist on a plant based </v>
<v Speaker 1>diet,</v>

1408
01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a lot of people literally </v>

1409
01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>absolutely can be done and I'm sure in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those 100,000</v>

1410
01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>generations there was plenty of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't exist on the hunter gatherer</v>

1411
01:01:49.491 --> 01:01:54.491
<v Speaker 1>diet alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the majority of money there were </v>

1412
01:01:54.491 --> 01:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>honestly because I feel like people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>just really super optimal opportunistic </v>

1413
01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

1414
01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you were just trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>survive and struggle,</v>

1415
01:01:59.390 --> 01:02:01.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you would say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1416
01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to eat that rabbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rabbit is the way I live,</v>

1417
01:02:05.871 --> 01:02:07.800
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to only where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>spelled and the left.</v>

1418
01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:12.880
<v Speaker 1>That's a different deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was writing a piece one time and then </v>

1419
01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>I got into reading about these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A basket weaver,</v>

1420
01:02:15.111 --> 01:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>people that were in the valley of fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>state park in Nevada,</v>

1421
01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>which is really close to Vegas</v>

1422
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:22.200
<v Speaker 4>and you should go if you've never been </v>
<v Speaker 4>up there.</v>

1423
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.700
<v Speaker 4>Basket weavers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1424
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
<v Speaker 4>Basket basket maker or a basket weaver </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and they're like native </v>

1425
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:29.000
<v Speaker 4>Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1426
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.680
<v Speaker 4>They were essentially a roving band of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nomadic hunters.</v>

1427
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:33.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't think of the year,</v>

1428
01:02:33.481 --> 01:02:38.481
<v Speaker 4>you probably look it up and find it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was different generations of </v>

1429
01:02:38.481 --> 01:02:40.440
<v Speaker 4>this essentially roving band of tribes </v>
<v Speaker 4>in that area.</v>

1430
01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:42.930
<v Speaker 4>Next time you're in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like an hour drive north.</v>

1431
01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:48.470
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of petroglyphs that </v>
<v Speaker 4>depict like dvds and and sheep and all </v>

1432
01:02:48.751 --> 01:02:49.660
<v Speaker 4>these different things there</v>

1433
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:54.770
<v Speaker 5>and you can just go visit them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's fucked up about those </v>

1434
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:54.770
<v Speaker 5>petroglyphs?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Man,</v>

1435
01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:57.330
<v Speaker 5>they're not protected like there's a </v>
<v Speaker 5>ranch in Texas that a buddy of mine went</v>

1436
01:02:57.331 --> 01:03:02.331
<v Speaker 5>to and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you could just go over there and touch </v>

1437
01:03:02.331 --> 01:03:02.460
<v Speaker 5>these things and they might be 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>years old.</v>

1438
01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:04.470
<v Speaker 4>I did that when my wife and I went up </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1439
01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:06.490
<v Speaker 4>You could have add a can of spray paint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They weren't like,</v>

1440
01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:08.310
<v Speaker 4>how fucked up is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's strange.</v>

1441
01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:09.840
<v Speaker 4>It's strange that you wouldn't find a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1442
01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:12.120
<v Speaker 4>but also probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1443
01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 4>it's probably okay because it's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>natural occurring.</v>

1444
01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.690
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a natural place.</v>

1445
01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.700
<v Speaker 4>You want to put fences up or no guard </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing there.</v>

1446
01:03:17.701 --> 01:03:18.640
<v Speaker 4>So what solutions?</v>

1447
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:20.470
<v Speaker 5>Pretty bad ass that no one's</v>

1448
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:22.230
<v Speaker 4>so far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1449
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.180
<v Speaker 4>and so you'd go up there and you see </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things and you're like,</v>

1450
01:03:24.181 --> 01:03:29.181
<v Speaker 4>holy crap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I started reading a little bit about </v>

1451
01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:29.181
<v Speaker 4>those people and they were a part of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>nomadic,</v>

1452
01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:34.440
<v Speaker 4>a band of hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gatherers that lived in caves and </v>

1453
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.580
<v Speaker 4>essentially followed a desert bighorn </v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep,</v>

1454
01:03:35.581 --> 01:03:38.070
<v Speaker 4>much like a end user.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The planes followup buffalo.</v>

1455
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.880
<v Speaker 4>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they were,</v>

1456
01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:42.120
<v Speaker 4>they essentially follow these things </v>
<v Speaker 4>into this valley.</v>

1457
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:45.660
<v Speaker 4>Eventually the Anasazi Anasazi Indians </v>
<v Speaker 4>move in,</v>

1458
01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.290
<v Speaker 4>they start cultivating the land and </v>
<v Speaker 4>planting crops and you get this like,</v>

1459
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.290
<v Speaker 4>oh my Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>agriculture and hunting,</v>

1460
01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:54.000
<v Speaker 4>which one is better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do we do?</v>

1461
01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:56.580
<v Speaker 4>And so the whole story of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>interaction,</v>

1462
01:03:57.050 --> 01:04:02.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is interesting to me because it's kind </v>

1463
01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:02.050
<v Speaker 4>of the evolution of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1464
01:04:02.050 --> 01:04:04.890
<v Speaker 4>Hunting is created this social structure</v>
<v Speaker 4>wise for us to communicate.</v>

1465
01:04:04.891 --> 01:04:09.891
<v Speaker 4>It's created all these things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ways for our body to grow and expand as </v>

1466
01:04:09.891 --> 01:04:09.891
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1467
01:04:09.891 --> 01:04:13.320
<v Speaker 4>early humans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a waste for our brain to expand and grow</v>

1468
01:04:13.321 --> 01:04:14.460
<v Speaker 4>and function differently.</v>

1469
01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.050
<v Speaker 4>And then you have this like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1470
01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:21.060
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot easier to plant crops in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground than it is to go kill a sheep.</v>

1471
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:22.230
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys,</v>

1472
01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:27.650
<v Speaker 4>anybody is this easier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so then you get into this weird thing </v>

1473
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.650
<v Speaker 4>like what do we do now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1474
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:32.570
<v Speaker 4>and so I think their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their story was very much like the </v>

1475
01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:37.460
<v Speaker 4>Anasazi Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go in and they cultivate this area </v>

1476
01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:37.460
<v Speaker 4>and as long as they can grow crops,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what they did,</v>

1477
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:41.320
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so this nomadic band of hunters kind</v>

1478
01:04:41.321 --> 01:04:45.240
<v Speaker 4>of settled in this area and so I'm sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>they still wanted to get me because they</v>

1479
01:04:45.241 --> 01:04:49.050
<v Speaker 4>have to because you can't grow a whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>year's worth of food for,</v>

1480
01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:54.410
<v Speaker 4>for a value like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think agriculture kind of won out </v>

1481
01:04:54.410 --> 01:04:56.100
<v Speaker 4>a little bit in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that scenario and as it would,</v>

1482
01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:58.060
<v Speaker 4>it's easier way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1483
01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.210
<v Speaker 4>it's an evolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1484
01:04:59.340 --> 01:04:59.790
<v Speaker 4>Easier way.</v>

1485
01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean the whole thing is filling your </v>
<v Speaker 5>belly.</v>

1486
01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:04.170
<v Speaker 5>That's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And everything you know,</v>

1487
01:05:04.171 --> 01:05:09.171
<v Speaker 5>you can do to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's with deer or whether it's </v>

1488
01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.200
<v Speaker 5>with corn or whether it's with tomatoes </v>
<v Speaker 5>or whatever.</v>

1489
01:05:10.201 --> 01:05:12.390
<v Speaker 5>You can grow and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just have to eat.</v>

1490
01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:14.100
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the whole,</v>

1491
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:16.380
<v Speaker 5>the whole picture is staying alive back </v>
<v Speaker 5>then.</v>

1492
01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:21.620
<v Speaker 5>That's not whole picture today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that's where it gets really </v>

1493
01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 5>complicated and that's where I think </v>
<v Speaker 5>that hunters have done a really good job</v>

1494
01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:28.270
<v Speaker 5>over the last x amount of years </v>
<v Speaker 5>describing to people like,</v>

1495
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:33.280
<v Speaker 5>if you're going to eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is the most ethical,</v>

1496
01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:36.550
<v Speaker 5>the most cruelty free and the most </v>
<v Speaker 5>natural way to do it.</v>

1497
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:40.330
<v Speaker 5>And you're talking about an animal that </v>
<v Speaker 5>literally like,</v>

1498
01:05:40.390 --> 01:05:41.560
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's a perfect example.</v>

1499
01:05:41.561 --> 01:05:43.890
<v Speaker 5>That deer mule deer that looking at </v>
<v Speaker 5>right here,</v>

1500
01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:49.200
<v Speaker 5>that deer had no idea I was alive until </v>
<v Speaker 5>it died and it died instantly.</v>

1501
01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:51.190
<v Speaker 5>It was boom,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one shot,</v>

1502
01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:54.310
<v Speaker 5>it dropped right where I shot it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's it.</v>

1503
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:56.620
<v Speaker 5>And then it becomes steak,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1504
01:05:56.621 --> 01:05:58.450
<v Speaker 5>and it becomes delicious food that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>ate.</v>

1505
01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:03.451
<v Speaker 5>And that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's way better than any other animal </v>

1506
01:06:03.451 --> 01:06:03.760
<v Speaker 5>that you're ever going to buy in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>store.</v>

1507
01:06:03.761 --> 01:06:05.680
<v Speaker 5>I don't care if you're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>farm raised,</v>

1508
01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:07.630
<v Speaker 5>grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1509
01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:08.290
<v Speaker 5>locally,</v>

1510
01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 4>I feel like your evolution as a hunter </v>
<v Speaker 4>has been accelerated more than most </v>

1511
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:14.140
<v Speaker 4>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how you do everything.</v>

1512
01:06:14.140 --> 01:06:16.450
<v Speaker 4>But you went from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I first we first hunting in British</v>

1513
01:06:16.451 --> 01:06:21.310
<v Speaker 4>Columbia was three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three years ago to where you are now.</v>

1514
01:06:21.410 --> 01:06:26.410
<v Speaker 4>You've evolved in this like what you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>as hunting and in our community and in </v>

1515
01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:27.970
<v Speaker 4>our world and doing different things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1516
01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:29.890
<v Speaker 4>and in some ways you evolve from when I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a kid,</v>

1517
01:06:29.891 --> 01:06:31.420
<v Speaker 4>we just shot deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1518
01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:33.810
<v Speaker 4>here's the spike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's a four point shot this deer.</v>

1519
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:38.880
<v Speaker 4>And that was a great day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We drag it off and eat it and it's </v>

1520
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:38.880
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

1521
01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.920
<v Speaker 4>I understand way more about what I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing then and what I'm doing now.</v>

1522
01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:47.520
<v Speaker 4>And I think what at hunters we need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be cognizant of and comfortable with is </v>

1523
01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:48.880
<v Speaker 4>you changed your sensibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Change over time.</v>

1524
01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:51.850
<v Speaker 4>You don't become a trophy hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not a trophy hunter,</v>

1525
01:06:51.851 --> 01:06:56.020
<v Speaker 4>but you do appreciate the difference </v>
<v Speaker 4>between a small antlered an animal and a</v>

1526
01:06:56.021 --> 01:07:01.021
<v Speaker 4>large one as it terms of its maturity </v>
<v Speaker 4>and how awesome it is to see a 380 inch </v>

1527
01:07:01.871 --> 01:07:04.000
<v Speaker 4>elk or 200 inch deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1528
01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:04.590
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1529
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.000
<v Speaker 4>you're pursued is different than it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>when we shot that Moose.</v>

1530
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:08.000
<v Speaker 4>It is also.</v>

1531
01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:13.040
<v Speaker 5>But the also part of the pursuit is </v>
<v Speaker 5>different is that I understand that the </v>

1532
01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.140
<v Speaker 5>benefit of going after mature animals is</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're getting a mature deer,</v>

1533
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.050
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about a deer that's five </v>
<v Speaker 5>years old,</v>

1534
01:07:19.290 --> 01:07:23.940
<v Speaker 5>that deer has had five breeding seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has spread its genes,</v>

1535
01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:29.210
<v Speaker 5>and by killing it you're going to give a</v>
<v Speaker 5>chance to the younger bucks to that are </v>

1536
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:30.930
<v Speaker 5>coming up to breed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So it's done.</v>

1537
01:07:30.931 --> 01:07:32.190
<v Speaker 5>It's part,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's spread,</v>

1538
01:07:32.191 --> 01:07:34.260
<v Speaker 5>it's jeans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's created its progeny,</v>

1539
01:07:34.261 --> 01:07:39.261
<v Speaker 5>and now you'll take it out of a mix.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And this is the right way to do it </v>

1540
01:07:39.261 --> 01:07:41.240
<v Speaker 5>because then you ensure a healthy herd </v>
<v Speaker 5>that like,</v>

1541
01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.250
<v Speaker 5>especially for bear,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's the big argument.</v>

1542
01:07:44.251 --> 01:07:49.251
<v Speaker 5>You want to take out the dominant males </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the dominant males actually eat </v>

1543
01:07:49.251 --> 01:07:50.490
<v Speaker 5>the cubs marauders,</v>
<v Speaker 5>animals.</v>

1544
01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:54.360
<v Speaker 5>That's the craziest part about it is by </v>
<v Speaker 5>shooting a bore,</v>

1545
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:57.080
<v Speaker 5>you're going to save the lives of many </v>
<v Speaker 5>bear.</v>

1546
01:07:57.081 --> 01:07:59.250
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a week in many ways.</v>

1547
01:07:59.251 --> 01:08:01.650
<v Speaker 5>It's kind of a catch 22 because you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about controlling.</v>

1548
01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.370
<v Speaker 4>Well isn't uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't a catch 22 that the,</v>

1549
01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:06.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>younger deer tastes better.</v>

1550
01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:11.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so like you're out there like I </v>

1551
01:08:11.530 --> 01:08:13.331
<v Speaker 4>really love access to your meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but to it when we're over there they're </v>

1552
01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:16.810
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have certain call box and there </v>

1553
01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:18.201
<v Speaker 4>certain things you want to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I really access to your and </v>

1554
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:18.201
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>

1555
01:08:18.201 --> 01:08:18.470
<v Speaker 2>if I was out there just for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have shot the youngest,</v>

1556
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:23.980
<v Speaker 2>probably not the youngest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would've picked a certain age </v>

1557
01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.661
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here's the argument against that </v>

1558
01:08:25.661 --> 01:08:25.760
<v Speaker 2>with axis deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that deer I shot was not young.</v>

1559
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.690
<v Speaker 2>That was a big ass dinner and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking things delicious dishes.</v>

1560
01:08:29.820 --> 01:08:31.940
<v Speaker 2>Like they're better than that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're younger.</v>

1561
01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:36.941
<v Speaker 2>I don't need that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fact that a younger animal is </v>

1562
01:08:36.941 --> 01:08:39.641
<v Speaker 2>more tender and is a better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better cut of meat than an older animal </v>

1563
01:08:39.641 --> 01:08:39.641
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In most cases.</v>

1564
01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:42.350
<v Speaker 2>Not all cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the general.</v>

1565
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.870
<v Speaker 2>That giant elk that I shot where you saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antlers.</v>

1566
01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:47.030
<v Speaker 2>They're all delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

1567
01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I've been eating that thing for eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>months now.</v>

1568
01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.110
<v Speaker 2>It's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1569
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:52.100
<v Speaker 2>I do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I.</v>

1570
01:08:52.101 --> 01:08:54.280
<v Speaker 2>elk is great no matter what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1571
01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:56.190
<v Speaker 2>Animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1572
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.920
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about two animals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

1573
01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:01.010
<v Speaker 2>It'd be hard to mess it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general that's the,</v>

1574
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:03.020
<v Speaker 2>that's the matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1575
01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:06.290
<v Speaker 2>Since there's that argument though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know why I don't like that argument.</v>

1576
01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:10.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind chewy meat and I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like eating what I kill,</v>

1577
01:09:10.410 --> 01:09:13.730
<v Speaker 2>so like it feels good to me on top of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>tasting good.</v>

1578
01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.940
<v Speaker 2>Like if I eat a deer that's a six year </v>
<v Speaker 2>old deer.</v>

1579
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:18.710
<v Speaker 2>There's two things going on there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

1580
01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:22.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a satisfaction that I know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>six year old is very difficult to hunt.</v>

1581
01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:23.420
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1582
01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:26.270
<v Speaker 2>so most of the places where you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>other people are hunting as well.</v>

1583
01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:29.540
<v Speaker 2>A six year old deer has seen people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are hunting deer period.</v>

1584
01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:32.090
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that deer is going to be on point.</v>

1585
01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a tough deer to kill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So by killing that deer,</v>

1586
01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:37.370
<v Speaker 2>you get extra satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one.</v>

1587
01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.830
<v Speaker 2>And then on to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1588
01:09:39.831 --> 01:09:40.430
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1589
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.520
<v Speaker 2>you're eating this animal that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this connection with.</v>

1590
01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.160
<v Speaker 2>So it tastes good because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'd like.</v>

1591
01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:51.170
<v Speaker 2>I like meat that tastes like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want like Philemon Yon,</v>

1592
01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1593
01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I like a deer steak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1594
01:09:54.021 --> 01:09:54.440
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1595
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.100
<v Speaker 2>the best a sirloin from a mule deer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd prefer that.</v>

1596
01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say like if you took </v>

1597
01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:03.280
<v Speaker 2>conservation and organic meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1598
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:04.580
<v Speaker 2>And you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going for.</v>

1599
01:10:04.670 --> 01:10:06.410
<v Speaker 2>I understand both those principals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going hunting.</v>

1600
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Everything's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're shooting that six year old mule </v>

1601
01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:11.530
<v Speaker 2>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1602
01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:11.530
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you remove conservation,</v>

1603
01:10:11.530 --> 01:10:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you're probably not going to shoot that </v>
<v Speaker 2>six year old mule deer because you're </v>

1604
01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:16.270
<v Speaker 2>going to get a younger deer that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to kill,</v>

1605
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:17.480
<v Speaker 2>more tender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more delicious.</v>

1606
01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Drink and shoot that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bartow Garcia,</v>

1607
01:10:19.941 --> 01:10:21.530
<v Speaker 2>the chef and the Montana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1608
01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.800
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets shit from other hunters because </v>

1609
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:26.800
<v Speaker 2>he'll shoot a spike on purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

1610
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.620
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here for the meat.</v>

1611
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:28.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As he goes,</v>

1612
01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:32.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm grocery shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be in general.</v>

1613
01:10:32.571 --> 01:10:35.510
<v Speaker 2>That should be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's principles that say like the</v>

1614
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:38.180
<v Speaker 2>shooting them mature animal is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>beneficial to the hurt.</v>

1615
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:43.150
<v Speaker 2>So that's yet another complexity that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>should all just say like,</v>

1616
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:44.030
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is here.</v>

1617
01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Just gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Continue to talk about it.</v>

1618
01:10:45.851 --> 01:10:50.851
<v Speaker 2>That's important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the way you approach is very </v>

1619
01:10:50.851 --> 01:10:53.801
<v Speaker 2>important because you're entirely honest</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the good and the bad and the bear </v>

1620
01:10:53.801 --> 01:10:53.830
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1621
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.360
<v Speaker 2>like it's like it's not the best meat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good man.</v>

1622
01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:58.400
<v Speaker 2>It's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as good as elk.</v>

1623
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:59.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to stand up and be like,</v>

1624
01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:04.751
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>policies mean to bears the best thing </v>

1625
01:11:04.751 --> 01:11:04.751
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

1626
01:11:04.751 --> 01:11:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Some people love it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're telling the </v>

1627
01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:08.230
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're telling the truth,</v>

1628
01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:08.540
<v Speaker 2>but it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just.</v>

1629
01:11:08.541 --> 01:11:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I would assure them if they would dabble</v>
<v Speaker 2>other mates,</v>

1630
01:11:12.710 --> 01:11:14.490
<v Speaker 2>they'll find that's better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure.</v>

1631
01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it depends entirely upon the way</v>

1632
01:11:16.951 --> 01:11:20.550
<v Speaker 2>they prepare it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing about this,</v>

1633
01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:25.580
<v Speaker 2>an argument for hunting bears is </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than the argument for hunting </v>

1634
01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:28.191
<v Speaker 2>any other animal because you do eat them</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you need to kill them because they </v>

1635
01:11:28.191 --> 01:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>don't have a natural predator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with bears is like,</v>

1636
01:11:30.121 --> 01:11:34.380
<v Speaker 2>especially if we went in Alberta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ to the art everywhere,</v>

1637
01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.920
<v Speaker 2>people to think there's a shortage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>bears need to go to Alberta.</v>

1638
01:11:38.390 --> 01:11:43.390
<v Speaker 4>The people that want to have one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those experiences where you walk away </v>

1639
01:11:43.390 --> 01:11:44.150
<v Speaker 4>from that and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did I just do that?</v>

1640
01:11:44.490 --> 01:11:49.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're 20 fucking bears hanging out </v>

1641
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:50.580
<v Speaker 2>over there with cam like I wish we get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Call Cam Cam please text in.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Launched to go workout and run the </v>

1648
01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:05.610
<v Speaker 2>mountains.</v>

1649
01:12:05.610 --> 01:12:05.960
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's savagery.</v>

1650
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:07.280
<v Speaker 4>This savagery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does</v>

1651
01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.110
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seven to five Scott.</v>

1652
01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:11.200
<v Speaker 2>Damn savage do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get my ass together and</v>

1653
01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:16.201
<v Speaker 2>he's a legit savage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know every time I'm complaining about </v>

1654
01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:16.310
<v Speaker 2>anything to think about campaigns </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting up at 4:00</v>

1655
01:12:16.311 --> 01:12:19.340
<v Speaker 2>in the morning to run with show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about that like 190,</v>

1656
01:12:19.341 --> 01:12:22.850
<v Speaker 2>eighth mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>205th.</v>

1657
01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:25.400
<v Speaker 2>He's going to do 2:30</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the summer.</v>

1658
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:30.590
<v Speaker 2>It only gets worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad was an ultra marathon runner </v>

1659
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.590
<v Speaker 2>growing up and it just gets worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like smoking crack.</v>

1660
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just get deeper into your grandma's</v>

1661
01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.280
<v Speaker 2>door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1662
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:38.350
<v Speaker 2>that's probably a terrible analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm scared of it because I keep </v>

1663
01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:39.230
<v Speaker 2>running further and further distances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1664
01:12:39.231 --> 01:12:41.630
<v Speaker 2>what am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm doing it more and more often.</v>

1665
01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.780
<v Speaker 2>What am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1666
01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.900
<v Speaker 2>you're feeling a runner's high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1667
01:12:44.901 --> 01:12:49.901
<v Speaker 2>it's a little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also like I feel improvement </v>

1668
01:12:49.901 --> 01:12:49.901
<v Speaker 2>and I'm a improvement junk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1669
01:12:49.901 --> 01:12:53.990
<v Speaker 2>I know that I can keep pushing further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going further distances.</v>

1670
01:12:53.991 --> 01:12:55.970
<v Speaker 2>I feel better when I hit the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hill.</v>

1671
01:12:56.210 --> 01:12:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1672
01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.520
<v Speaker 4>Well my dad like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1673
01:12:57.521 --> 01:13:00.650
<v Speaker 4>when I was a kid I remember my dad just </v>
<v Speaker 4>being a regular,</v>

1674
01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:05.480
<v Speaker 4>he must have been mid forties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe late forties and he mowed,</v>

1675
01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:09.410
<v Speaker 4>we had like a fairly small backyard and </v>
<v Speaker 4>he mowed a little circle and he would go</v>

1676
01:13:09.411 --> 01:13:14.411
<v Speaker 4>out after work in his jeans and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>loafers and like jog around the circle </v>

1677
01:13:14.411 --> 01:13:16.070
<v Speaker 4>and it was very like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember looking out there being like,</v>

1678
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.260
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How big was he hard?</v>

1679
01:13:18.530 --> 01:13:20.370
<v Speaker 4>It was like maybe an acre,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1680
01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:24.110
<v Speaker 4>It would very big and he was running </v>
<v Speaker 4>like just little circles in this yard.</v>

1681
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:26.540
<v Speaker 4>Let me get to the end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll,</v>

1682
01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:28.520
<v Speaker 4>you'll get it eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that was,</v>

1683
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.770
<v Speaker 4>that was his way to run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1684
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:35.330
<v Speaker 4>And so after a while he started running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1685
01:13:35.331 --> 01:13:40.331
<v Speaker 4>got running shoes and started to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>into the actual sport of running and </v>

1686
01:13:40.331 --> 01:13:42.980
<v Speaker 4>then it seems to me like three or four </v>
<v Speaker 4>years later he was like,</v>

1687
01:13:42.981 --> 01:13:46.100
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm going to run this 50 mile </v>
<v Speaker 4>race in the mountains of Maryland,</v>

1688
01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:47.270
<v Speaker 4>JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 miler.</v>

1689
01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.120
<v Speaker 2>And had he run marathons?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1690
01:13:51.770 --> 01:13:54.930
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So 50 mile races.</v>

1691
01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like six hours,</v>

1692
01:13:56.851 --> 01:13:57.840
<v Speaker 2>seven hours a year.</v>

1693
01:13:58.430 --> 01:14:00.060
<v Speaker 4>Eight or nine hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>

1694
01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:02.910
<v Speaker 4>Eight or nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think when you started or maybe 10.</v>

1695
01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.350
<v Speaker 4>I think 12.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

1696
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.600
<v Speaker 2>cuddle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>

1697
01:14:05.601 --> 01:14:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Like eight hours for 50 per for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred.</v>

1698
01:14:08.031 --> 01:14:09.650
<v Speaker 2>It's 24.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it is.</v>

1699
01:14:09.651 --> 01:14:12.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like listen bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>75.</v>

1700
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:19.950
<v Speaker 4>But my dad used to run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to run and places it was like </v>

1701
01:14:19.950 --> 01:14:21.550
<v Speaker 4>the JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 4>$50 up over this mountain.</v>

1702
01:14:21.551 --> 01:14:26.551
<v Speaker 4>It's not like I remember you telling me </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories of people falling and like </v>

1703
01:14:26.551 --> 01:14:30.210
<v Speaker 4>busting themselves all up on these rocky</v>
<v Speaker 4>cliff trails and he would come in and </v>

1704
01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:32.050
<v Speaker 4>this is gonna make my dad sound weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not,</v>

1705
01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's awesome.</v>

1706
01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:38.340
<v Speaker 4>But he would save his toenails.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All his toenails would fall off during </v>

1707
01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:39.220
<v Speaker 4>the race and he like save them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting them in a little jar.</v>

1708
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:42.100
<v Speaker 4>Memories he save his boogers to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1709
01:14:42.101 --> 01:14:42.970
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just toenails.</v>

1710
01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:44.930
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was almost like this,</v>

1711
01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.760
<v Speaker 4>like I can take that lack this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then he went,</v>

1712
01:14:48.761 --> 01:14:53.761
<v Speaker 4>ran 50 and then I think one time we ran </v>
<v Speaker 4>a hundred and then he ran the entire c </v>

1713
01:14:53.761 --> 01:14:55.060
<v Speaker 4>and o canal one time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>183 miles.</v>

1714
01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.610
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was in maybe a senior in high</v>

1715
01:14:57.611 --> 01:15:02.611
<v Speaker 4>school and I had had to drive to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>checkpoints and like give him food and </v>

1716
01:15:02.611 --> 01:15:02.611
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1717
01:15:02.611 --> 01:15:04.870
<v Speaker 4>He never started until he was in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>forties guy,</v>

1718
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:06.640
<v Speaker 4>maybe fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>forties,</v>

1719
01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:08.970
<v Speaker 4>probably I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1720
01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:10.240
<v Speaker 4>like sorties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did He,</v>

1721
01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:11.890
<v Speaker 4>does he still do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old is he now?</v>

1722
01:15:12.010 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 4>He would still do it if his knees would </v>
<v Speaker 4>allow him to.</v>

1723
01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.950
<v Speaker 4>He's mid sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 4>60 five is nice.</v>

1724
01:15:15.951 --> 01:15:17.110
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But he's still.</v>

1725
01:15:17.111 --> 01:15:18.850
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll still bike and he'll still.</v>

1726
01:15:18.851 --> 01:15:23.851
<v Speaker 4>He hikes all the time now so we still </v>
<v Speaker 4>has that like need to push push and he </v>

1727
01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:30.290
<v Speaker 4>like when he gets around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of his buddies in particular that </v>

1728
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:32.820
<v Speaker 4>they ran together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like old army buddies and </v>

1729
01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.701
<v Speaker 4>talking about this experience that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>shared together like remember that one </v>

1730
01:15:35.701 --> 01:15:39.721
<v Speaker 4>time a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mile 94 when you tripped and fell and </v>

1731
01:15:39.721 --> 01:15:40.510
<v Speaker 4>it's just like they're telling old war </v>
<v Speaker 4>stories.</v>

1732
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:43.270
<v Speaker 4>It's like this visceral thing that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>share.</v>

1733
01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:47.170
<v Speaker 4>It's really cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did it passed.</v>

1734
01:15:47.171 --> 01:15:48.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean maybe it's a midlife crisis man.</v>

1735
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:50.380
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

1736
01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.970
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't predisposed to run 100 miles </v>
<v Speaker 4>until he decided that he wanted to.</v>

1737
01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird,</v>

1738
01:15:57.971 --> 01:15:58.530
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That,</v>

1739
01:15:58.531 --> 01:16:03.531
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that compulsion is a very odd one that </v>

1740
01:16:03.531 --> 01:16:04.810
<v Speaker 4>the need for suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Cam's got it bad,</v>

1741
01:16:05.050 --> 01:16:06.700
<v Speaker 4>it becomes a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:08.680
<v Speaker 4>He's got a bat in a weird way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or my dad,</v>

1743
01:16:08.681 --> 01:16:10.680
<v Speaker 4>like he got a knee surgery and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1744
01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.790
<v Speaker 4>well they said it was a acl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was.</v>

1745
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.110
<v Speaker 4>Or it was the scope of his knee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had an eastern scope scope.</v>

1746
01:16:16.111 --> 01:16:18.730
<v Speaker 4>It's an easy one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what if they cut his knee open?</v>

1747
01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.710
<v Speaker 4>Can't remember what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say the wrong one,</v>

1748
01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:22.000
<v Speaker 4>but he had knee surgery and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1749
01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:24.400
<v Speaker 4>give it four or five days before you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>up and moving around.</v>

1750
01:16:24.401 --> 01:16:27.220
<v Speaker 4>And he was like joking around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>backyard on day two,</v>

1751
01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:29.740
<v Speaker 4>limping around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just you could just tell he was in pain.</v>

1752
01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:30.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that must have been meniscus.</v>

1753
01:16:31.050 --> 01:16:32.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

1754
01:16:32.231 --> 01:16:34.390
<v Speaker 4>Some tendon of some sort,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was just like,</v>

1755
01:16:34.391 --> 01:16:36.120
<v Speaker 4>you could just see this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This dude is.</v>

1756
01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:38.020
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can't do this man,</v>

1757
01:16:38.050 --> 01:16:41.290
<v Speaker 4>it's not good for his psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he can do it,</v>

1758
01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:42.930
<v Speaker 4>he's a happy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1759
01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:47.940
<v Speaker 4>there's something that happens to you </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you push yourself like that where </v>

1760
01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.390
<v Speaker 4>it makes regular life easier and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>part of the addiction.</v>

1761
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:51.160
<v Speaker 4>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I went to Nepal,</v>

1762
01:16:51.161 --> 01:16:52.870
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's exactly why I came back.</v>

1763
01:16:52.871 --> 01:16:57.871
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought back a sheep I killed and all </v>

1764
01:16:57.871 --> 01:17:00.160
<v Speaker 4>that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but perspective as what you were telling</v>

1765
01:17:00.161 --> 01:17:03.910
<v Speaker 4>me how you were hallucinating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>baby.</v>

1766
01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:05.830
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me about that.</v>

1767
01:17:06.170 --> 01:17:08.170
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How high were you?</v>

1768
01:17:08.260 --> 01:17:08.980
<v Speaker 4>We got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll have to.</v>

1769
01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.190
<v Speaker 4>We were there.</v>

1770
01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.770
<v Speaker 2>We were like 13,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe 13 years.</v>

1771
01:17:12.771 --> 01:17:14.450
<v Speaker 2>13.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Five at 13,000</v>

1772
01:17:14.451 --> 01:17:17.720
<v Speaker 2>feet above sea level and so it's sketchy</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fuck.</v>

1773
01:17:17.721 --> 01:17:19.310
<v Speaker 2>It's sketchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not something to mess around with.</v>

1774
01:17:19.311 --> 01:17:23.690
<v Speaker 2>I found that especially on this trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we were hunting blue sheep in Nepal,</v>

1775
01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Belushi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belushi.</v>

1776
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:26.360
<v Speaker 2>What does that look?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look it up.</v>

1777
01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.000
<v Speaker 2>Kind of like an all dad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got these little.</v>

1778
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:30.620
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got really,</v>

1779
01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:34.100
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can really see their annual.</v>

1780
01:17:34.101 --> 01:17:36.550
<v Speaker 2>I like the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The age rings and their horns.</v>

1781
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:39.320
<v Speaker 2>They go straight out the short and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stocky.</v>

1782
01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:44.380
<v Speaker 2>It'd be cool to look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were cool animal and it's one of </v>

1783
01:17:44.380 --> 01:17:44.510
<v Speaker 2>those things where we went to hunt him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't really have much of an idea</v>

1784
01:17:44.511 --> 01:17:48.080
<v Speaker 2>of what blue sheep was until until we </v>
<v Speaker 2>started getting into the thing.</v>

1785
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:49.330
<v Speaker 2>There's one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1786
01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Morales.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they call me over there.</v>

1787
01:17:50.660 --> 01:17:52.250
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a cooler can animal.</v>

1788

01:17:53.661 --> 01:17:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Mine wasn't quite that big and that one </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like it might be at a farm,</v>

1790
01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:02.680
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's mowed grass and then maybe </v>

1791
01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:02.930
<v Speaker 2>we don't to go mow the grass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks like more.</v>

1792
01:18:03.490 --> 01:18:08.490
<v Speaker 2>I saw a very disturbing video of a goat </v>
<v Speaker 2>eating a whole bucket of chicks.</v>

01:22:58.710 --> 01:23:00.420
<v Speaker 2>arms and back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my brand,</v>

1906
01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:02.280
<v Speaker 2>my brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brand marketing team,</v>

1907
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:05.740
<v Speaker 2>working hard on my brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like those,</v>

1908
01:23:05.770 --> 01:23:06.190
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>

1909
01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:10.480
<v Speaker 4>those kind of phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people use those a lot and they won't do</v>

1910
01:23:10.481 --> 01:23:13.570
<v Speaker 4>something because it's off brand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's even a lead.</v>

1911
01:23:13.571 --> 01:23:18.571
<v Speaker 4>That's an extra level of Douchey brand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I won't put that up because it's </v>

1912
01:23:19.271 --> 01:23:22.270
<v Speaker 4>off brand for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was like my brand,</v>

1913
01:23:22.271 --> 01:23:22.930
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1914
01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:27.520
<v Speaker 4>That'll fuck with putting out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seems quite preposterous.</v>

1915
01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.860
<v Speaker 4>Social media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So tell me about seeing the baby and the</v>

1916
01:23:30.861 --> 01:23:31.750
<v Speaker 4>polio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me finish.</v>

1917
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:34.400
<v Speaker 4>So you're looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1918
01:23:34.570 --> 01:23:38.440
<v Speaker 4>so we're looking for the blue sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'll start off by saying that we were</v>

1919
01:23:38.441 --> 01:23:41.920
<v Speaker 4>hunting in a very rural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I say rural,</v>

1920
01:23:41.921 --> 01:23:46.921
<v Speaker 4>it's like six days walk from the nearest</v>
<v Speaker 4>road where we were at the days and I </v>

1921
01:23:47.141 --> 01:23:50.080
<v Speaker 4>said how many days walk to the paved </v>
<v Speaker 4>road and they were like we don't,</v>

1922
01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:53.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't know we could engage that.</v>

1923
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:56.630
<v Speaker 4>And so we're in this remote region in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nepal,</v>

1924
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:59.440
<v Speaker 4>the in this district called the </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] district.</v>

1925
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:03.340
<v Speaker 4>And to say that the road from district </v>
<v Speaker 4>is full of this,</v>

1926
01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:08.341
<v Speaker 4>like primal primal people and animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it is really just out their place.</v>

1927
01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:10.880
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1928
01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:15.900
<v Speaker 4>to be out away from civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the furthest I think you could </v>

1929
01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:16.270
<v Speaker 4>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1930
01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:21.330
<v Speaker 4>we were out there and the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people there were part of a civil </v>

1931
01:24:23.201 --> 01:24:26.800
<v Speaker 4>war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Nepali civil war from 1996 to 2006.</v>

1932
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.940
<v Speaker 4>This district was maybe the epicenter of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the rebellion.</v>

1933
01:24:30.970 --> 01:24:33.460
<v Speaker 4>There was a Communist Party rebelling </v>
<v Speaker 4>against the government.</v>

1934
01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:38.350
<v Speaker 4>We can step monarchy and so the people </v>
<v Speaker 4>there are,</v>

1935
01:24:38.410 --> 01:24:43.410
<v Speaker 4>are amazing because they've lived in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this abject poverty for their entire </v>

1936
01:24:43.481 --> 01:24:48.481
<v Speaker 4>lives and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've lived through this civil war in </v>

1937
01:24:49.511 --> 01:24:51.490
<v Speaker 4>recent times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we think about civil wars,</v>

1938
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:55.170
<v Speaker 4>this thing we go to see a national park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1939
01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:57.330
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

1940
01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:00.640
<v Speaker 4>we're with these people were hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We go into,</v>

1941
01:25:00.641 --> 01:25:02.260
<v Speaker 4>we get helicoptered into 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>feet,</v>

1942
01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:04.570
<v Speaker 4>which is this knob in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 4>nowhere.</v>

1943
01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:08.380
<v Speaker 4>We hike about a full day to our base </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp,</v>

1944
01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:11.260
<v Speaker 4>which is a little village called dual </v>
<v Speaker 4>arc in the middle,</v>

1945
01:25:11.261 --> 01:25:16.261
<v Speaker 4>of course nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like this terrorist village and we </v>

1946
01:25:16.261 --> 01:25:18.190
<v Speaker 4>meet our Sherpas and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and made a bunch of locals.</v>

1947
01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:21.790
<v Speaker 4>And from there we go up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to do,</v>

1948
01:25:21.791 --> 01:25:25.360
<v Speaker 4>I think we had two or three more days of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hiking just to get to the area where the</v>

1949
01:25:25.361 --> 01:25:28.060
<v Speaker 4>blue sheep live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're hiking from about 10,000</v>

1950
01:25:28.061 --> 01:25:33.061
<v Speaker 4>feet and I at our highest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're at probably 16 or 16 and some </v>

1951
01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:36.310
<v Speaker 4>change and so the first day we go up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we acclimate.</v>

1952
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:41.790
<v Speaker 4>We site in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our rifles were hanging out and we go </v>

1953
01:25:41.790 --> 01:25:45.220
<v Speaker 4>into this lady's little mud,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirt hut.</v>

1954
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:48.280
<v Speaker 4>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like probably half the size of</v>

1955
01:25:48.281 --> 01:25:53.281
<v Speaker 4>this room with a little with a goat </v>
<v Speaker 4>standing in the corner and a little fire</v>

1956
01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:57.250
<v Speaker 4>pit sitting around this fire pit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they start.</v>

1957
01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:02.340
<v Speaker 4>She starts telling this story about how </v>
<v Speaker 4>right where we were sitting during the </v>

1958
01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:02.340
<v Speaker 4>rebellion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the police,</v>

1959
01:26:02.340 --> 01:26:07.261
<v Speaker 4>the government police came in and shot </v>
<v Speaker 4>six men right where we were sitting and </v>

1960
01:26:07.261 --> 01:26:11.090
<v Speaker 4>buried him out back and this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this lady must be in her mid fifties and</v>

1961
01:26:11.091 --> 01:26:13.040
<v Speaker 4>she.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She looked like she was 80.</v>

1962
01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:15.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's just like this.</v>

1963
01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:20.540
<v Speaker 4>It was this transformative thing for me </v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting there listening to this being </v>

1964
01:26:20.540 --> 01:26:21.740
<v Speaker 4>translated like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy crap,</v>

1965
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:24.260
<v Speaker 4>where are we?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in the midst of that store,</v>

1966
01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:26.510
<v Speaker 4>they're passing around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They had made this moonshine,</v>

1967
01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:31.511
<v Speaker 4>which they called Roxy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just like made in a ceramic thing </v>

1968
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:36.910
<v Speaker 4>outside of where we were at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we were all just drinking and I </v>

1969
01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:39.311
<v Speaker 4>wasn't thinking much about drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then we had one more day before we </v>

1970
01:26:39.311 --> 01:26:40.760
<v Speaker 4>left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next day everybody was sick,</v>

1971
01:26:40.761 --> 01:26:42.350
<v Speaker 4>but me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking shit,</v>

1972
01:26:42.351 --> 01:26:44.330
<v Speaker 4>your pants puke out the tent.</v>

1973
01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:47.300
<v Speaker 4>We had two or three people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit their pants the next day.</v>

1974
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:50.000
<v Speaker 4>Like it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Katmandu flu.</v>

1975
01:26:50.001 --> 01:26:55.001
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody that wasn't native to that </v>

1976
01:26:55.001 --> 01:26:55.460
<v Speaker 4>area got sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't on the first day.</v>

1977
01:26:56.540 --> 01:27:01.540
<v Speaker 4>So everybody recovers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The next day we're going up the </v>

1978
01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:01.540
<v Speaker 4>mountain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going up.</v>

1979
01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:05.950
<v Speaker 4>We'd probably climbed about 2000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We go over this pass and I'm feeling </v>

1980
01:27:05.961 --> 01:27:10.961
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like everybody else was probably </v>

1981
01:27:10.961 --> 01:27:12.761
<v Speaker 4>feeling pretty crappy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then we're going down this ravine and </v>

1982
01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:17.581
<v Speaker 4>this river valley to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're on these like two or three foot </v>

1983
01:27:17.581 --> 01:27:19.670
<v Speaker 4>wide goat trails probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like if you go to the right,</v>

1984
01:27:19.671 --> 01:27:21.290
<v Speaker 4>you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you stepped two feet to the right,</v>

1985
01:27:21.291 --> 01:27:22.160
<v Speaker 4>you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're dead.</v>

1986
01:27:22.161 --> 01:27:24.980
<v Speaker 4>You fall off and you're dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got 24 Sherpas,</v>

1987
01:27:25.210 --> 01:27:30.210
<v Speaker 4>porters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've got three or four mules with all </v>

1988
01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:32.090
<v Speaker 4>our camp gear going up this mountain and</v>
<v Speaker 4>a string of people,</v>

1989
01:27:32.091 --> 01:27:33.170
<v Speaker 4>probably 30 people long.</v>

1990
01:27:33.890 --> 01:27:38.890
<v Speaker 4>I'm in generally in the middle and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop at some point after we had crested </v>

1991
01:27:38.890 --> 01:27:42.770
<v Speaker 4>this high point and we're going down and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember feeling pretty good.</v>

1992
01:27:42.771 --> 01:27:44.210
<v Speaker 4>I got my trekking Poles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going,</v>

1993
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.240
<v Speaker 4>it's warm outside and I'm going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like enjoying the view and looking </v>

1994
01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:49.790
<v Speaker 4>around just thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

1995
01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:55.480
<v Speaker 4>And then I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I remember pretty quickly being </v>

1996
01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:55.480
<v Speaker 4>laying in the snow like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1997
01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm laying in the snow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

1998
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:59.780
<v Speaker 4>Like I had no recollection of how I got </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

1999
01:27:59.781 --> 01:28:04.781
<v Speaker 4>What was happening at like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're hiking and then when you wake </v>

2000
01:28:04.781 --> 01:28:06.470
<v Speaker 4>up I was laying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that I lost consciousness,</v>

2001
01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:11.471
<v Speaker 4>but I just didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think in my mind I understood </v>

2002
01:28:11.471 --> 01:28:13.931
<v Speaker 4>what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I kinda stumbled back against this </v>

2003
01:28:13.931 --> 01:28:14.210
<v Speaker 4>rock wall and then just slumped down in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the snow.</v>

2004
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:19.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't think anybody saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I kind of stood up and I'm like,</v>

2005
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:21.170
<v Speaker 4>you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're good,</v>

2006
01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:23.320
<v Speaker 4>you fell down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

2007
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:28.350
<v Speaker 4>maybe getting a little weird and I keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>going and we had a little problem with </v>

2008
01:28:28.350 --> 01:28:29.000
<v Speaker 4>the mules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These mules,</v>

2009
01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:31.370
<v Speaker 4>we were going over the snow pass in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>mules,</v>

2010
01:28:31.371 --> 01:28:33.440
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get through it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they had to turn these meals around,</v>

2011
01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:35.780
<v Speaker 4>send them back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't get through it because the</v>

2012
01:28:35.781 --> 01:28:36.410
<v Speaker 4>snow's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2013
01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.020
<v Speaker 4>I got videos of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of snow's too deep and you're talking to</v>

2014
01:28:39.021 --> 01:28:44.021
<v Speaker 4>trail half as wide as this table.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they're trying to get these and </v>

2015
01:28:44.021 --> 01:28:44.021
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2016
01:28:44.021 --> 01:28:44.930
<v Speaker 4>a thousand feet down to the river.</v>

2017
01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:49.040
<v Speaker 4>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we stopped,</v>

2018
01:28:49.041 --> 01:28:52.160
<v Speaker 4>we all stopped a second time to let </v>
<v Speaker 4>these meals go back by.</v>

2019
01:28:52.161 --> 01:28:57.161
<v Speaker 4>And like I had to hang onto a bush on </v>
<v Speaker 4>the side of the trail as they went by </v>

2020
01:28:57.161 --> 01:29:00.640
<v Speaker 4>and I got back up on the trail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're hanging onto a bush for dear </v>

2021
01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:00.640
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you could,</v>

2022
01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:01.740
<v Speaker 4>you had footing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we had,</v>

2023
01:29:01.741 --> 01:29:04.320
<v Speaker 4>we had filmmakers with us that we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

2024
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:07.860
<v Speaker 4>Like hanging off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hanging off cliffs and doing stuff.</v>

2025
01:29:07.861 --> 01:29:09.280
<v Speaker 4>I will make a video.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2026
01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:12.870
<v Speaker 4>To make film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were um,</v>

2027
01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.960
<v Speaker 4>and so we stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We start going again,</v>

2028
01:29:16.290 --> 01:29:21.290
<v Speaker 4>most everybody gets out in front of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was slowing up and I'm feeling dizzy </v>

2029
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:21.290
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2030
01:29:21.290 --> 01:29:21.660
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I just stood up too fast.</v>

2031
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:25.350
<v Speaker 4>Probably didn't eat enough today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going,</v>

2032
01:29:25.351 --> 01:29:29.550
<v Speaker 4>we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at some point I just like snapped in</v>

2033
01:29:29.551 --> 01:29:31.920
<v Speaker 4>the room was just like spinning like </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

2034
01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:36.600
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking and I knew about </v>
<v Speaker 4>altitude sickness and I knew that I live</v>

2035
01:29:36.601 --> 01:29:40.680
<v Speaker 4>in a place that's basically sea level </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was at a place that was 13,000</v>

2036
01:29:40.681 --> 01:29:45.180
<v Speaker 4>feet and I've never done that before and</v>
<v Speaker 4>prepare for it at all.</v>

2037
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:47.280
<v Speaker 4>He should have can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's not really any.</v>

2038
01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:48.990
<v Speaker 4>I trained.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did for about.</v>

2039
01:29:49.110 --> 01:29:51.030
<v Speaker 4>We didn't really know we were going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go until later.</v>

2040
01:29:51.031 --> 01:29:52.620
<v Speaker 4>So I trained for about a month and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>half.</v>

2041
01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not a,</v>

2042
01:29:53.940 --> 01:29:55.620
<v Speaker 4>you can't train.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's no.</v>

2043
01:29:55.650 --> 01:29:58.200
<v Speaker 4>They told me before we go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like altitude sickness,</v>

2044
01:29:58.201 --> 01:30:03.201
<v Speaker 4>there's no predictor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could be a rookie or you could be a </v>

2045
01:30:03.201 --> 01:30:03.201
<v Speaker 4>veteran.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can get it like that.</v>

2046
01:30:03.201 --> 01:30:03.510
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just,</v>

2047
01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:08.460
<v Speaker 4>it's part of the way your brain loses </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxygen at those altitudes and it's,</v>

2048
01:30:08.461 --> 01:30:13.461
<v Speaker 4>there's no real predictor for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I don't think physically I was </v>

2049
01:30:13.461 --> 01:30:17.151
<v Speaker 4>having any problems but so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know that I had altitude </v>

2050
01:30:17.151 --> 01:30:17.151
<v Speaker 4>sickness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>

2051
01:30:17.151 --> 01:30:22.040
<v Speaker 4>the effects were I kind of sat down and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I just couldn't go anymore because I </v>

2052
01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.160
<v Speaker 4>couldn't get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't about to walk on this trail and</v>

2053
01:30:23.161 --> 01:30:24.330
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it stand up.</v>

2054
01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:27.930
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so our medic slash interpreter slash</v>

2055
01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:33.890
<v Speaker 4>producer Cameron,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Ben [inaudible] comes back to me and</v>

2056
01:30:34.351 --> 01:30:35.790
<v Speaker 4>starts talking to me through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

2057
01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:37.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this dude's climbed everywhere.</v>

2058
01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:39.120
<v Speaker 4>I've been everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2059
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:44.390
<v Speaker 4>and as a medic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he's talking me through a little </v>

2060
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.390
<v Speaker 4>bit of the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2061
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:45.390
<v Speaker 4>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you're too lazy to walk,</v>

2062
01:30:46.170 --> 01:30:48.540
<v Speaker 4>no good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's get some water in you.</v>

2063
01:30:48.541 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 4>Let's rest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's get some food in.</v>

2064
01:30:49.951 --> 01:30:54.951
<v Speaker 4>You see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The meanwhile up the valley go to the </v>

2065
01:30:54.951 --> 01:30:56.370
<v Speaker 4>rest of the crew to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the next camp.</v>

2066
01:30:57.210 --> 01:31:00.510
<v Speaker 4>So him and I spent like 20 minutes just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going really slow and I just couldn't do</v>

2067
01:31:00.511 --> 01:31:00.870
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2068
01:31:00.871 --> 01:31:03.330
<v Speaker 4>I can't stand up dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't catch my,</v>

2069
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:05.430
<v Speaker 4>I can't get my head to get back on my </v>
<v Speaker 4>shoulders.</v>

2070
01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:10.450
<v Speaker 4>And so we sit down and we're sitting </v>
<v Speaker 4>there and uh,</v>

2071
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:13.230
<v Speaker 4>I look across this little bowl in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>valley and I see this wolf.</v>

2072
01:31:13.230 --> 01:31:13.680
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Put them back.</v>

2076
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:18.570
<v Speaker 4>We'll go over.</v>

<v Speaker 4>you're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See a wolf?</v>

2084
01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:39.480
<v Speaker 4>Fear basically don't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't exist where we were in that </v>

2085
01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:39.630
<v Speaker 4>district,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

2086
01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:41.110
<v Speaker 4>in the hunting area where we were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2087
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:42.540
<v Speaker 4>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>

2088
01:31:42.690 --> 01:31:44.550
<v Speaker 4>So you were hallucinating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was hallucinating,</v>

2089
01:31:44.551 --> 01:31:47.340
<v Speaker 4>but it was not one of those like you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and then you shake your head and it's</v>

2090
01:31:47.341 --> 01:31:52.341
<v Speaker 4>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a looking at it and it was </v>

2091
01:31:52.341 --> 01:31:53.380
<v Speaker 4>just this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what?</v>

2092
01:31:53.381 --> 01:31:56.220
<v Speaker 4>It could have been stumped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in my mind it was a freaking wolf.</v>

2093
01:31:56.610 --> 01:32:01.610
<v Speaker 4>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Losing my shit a little bit at that </v>

2094
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.610
<v Speaker 4>point I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is not good.</v>

2095
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:04.330
<v Speaker 4>And so then I'm sure in his mind he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking diamox is a,</v>

2096
01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:09.720
<v Speaker 4>is a pill you can take to help with </v>
<v Speaker 4>altitude sickness and he's thinking </v>

2097
01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:09.720
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

<v Speaker 4>are we helicopter and this guy out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>here on day two out to what are we going</v>

2099
01:32:12.671 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 4>to do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because it's,</v>

2100
01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.110
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

2101
01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:15.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulmonary edema,</v>

2102
01:32:15.911 --> 01:32:17.710
<v Speaker 4>cerebral edema.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's nothing to mess around with.</v>

2103
01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:19.140
<v Speaker 4>It was only day two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

2104
01:32:19.141 --> 01:32:21.100
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well Day two of the actual trip.</v>

2105
01:32:21.730 --> 01:32:23.500
<v Speaker 4>We were four or five days into being in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nepal,</v>

2106
01:32:23.501 --> 01:32:25.750
<v Speaker 4>but they too have the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the trick in.</v>

2107
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:31.710
<v Speaker 4>And so we sat there for awhile and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I just look in and I remember just </v>

2108
01:32:31.710 --> 01:32:32.450
<v Speaker 4>looking after like 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still being there.</v>

2109
01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:37.960
<v Speaker 4>This is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we get up to go and I'm like,</v>

2110
01:32:37.961 --> 01:32:42.961
<v Speaker 4>I can do it man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to do it because I don't want </v>

2111
01:32:42.961 --> 01:32:42.961
<v Speaker 4>to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to hunt and we get going a little</v>

2112
01:32:42.961 --> 01:32:47.881
<v Speaker 4>further down this trail and at this </v>
<v Speaker 4>point I'm trying to like find some </v>

<v Speaker 4>We're just like trying to be normal and </v>

2115
01:32:53.581 --> 01:32:56.100
<v Speaker 4>when I know that my head's not normal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going real slow and I look on this</v>

2116
01:32:56.890 --> 01:32:59.440
<v Speaker 4>side hill of this trail and there's a </v>

<v Speaker 6>baby if I didn't have a diaper on how </v>

<v Speaker 6>I don't know Joe Dark Shit we're getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>into.</v>

2122
01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:24.570
<v Speaker 6>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was an unusually saw.</v>

2123
01:33:24.571 --> 01:33:26.310
<v Speaker 6>It was like a baby that</v>

2124
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:28.600
<v Speaker 4>if you saw it on the street you'd be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2125
01:33:28.601 --> 01:33:29.710
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what a whopper.</v>

2126
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:32.770
<v Speaker 4>That's a serious baby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Science should be studying.</v>

2136
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:56.750
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like the wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like I saw it and I stared at </v>

2137
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:59.430
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw it and then I looked back and it </v>

2138
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.430
<v Speaker 4>was there and I looked back and wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2139
01:33:59.430 --> 01:33:59.430
<v Speaker 4>So I kept going.</v>

<v Speaker 4>hallucinating anymore than the baby and </v>

2153
01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:28.780

<v Speaker 4>which is enough and we get down,</v>

2154
01:34:28.781 --> 01:34:33.781
<v Speaker 4>we get going down this ravine and camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can start to see camp guys put in </v>

2155
01:34:33.781 --> 01:34:33.781
<v Speaker 4>camp together.</v>

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:58.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's going on sick like the other </v>

2166
01:34:58.780 --> 01:34:59.420
<v Speaker 4>people got so yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that happened the next day.</v>

2167
01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:02.450
<v Speaker 4>So the next thing it was because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking that moonshine.</v>

2168
01:35:02.900 --> 01:35:04.550
<v Speaker 4>I think we got sick because of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moonshine.</v>

2169
01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:09.820
<v Speaker 4>It could have been water in Katmandu it </v>
<v Speaker 4>commit to anything or how are they </v>

2170
01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:09.820
<v Speaker 4>making that moonshine?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no.</v>

2171
01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:10.660
<v Speaker 4>I have a picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I show you like it.</v>

2172
01:35:10.661 --> 01:35:15.661
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looked like in this big ceramic </v>

2173
01:35:15.661 --> 01:35:15.661
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>

2174
01:35:15.661 --> 01:35:17.970
<v Speaker 4>It's probably a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goat was walking over there licking out </v>

2175
01:35:17.970 --> 01:35:19.520
<v Speaker 4>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we all did it.</v>

2176
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:24.110
<v Speaker 4>Everybody in there got some level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sickness that wasn't used to that area.</v>

2177
01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:29.240
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't used to being in Nepal and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating food and drinking the minutiae </v>

2178
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:29.240
<v Speaker 4>and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So who knows?</v>

2179
01:35:29.240 --> 01:35:31.480
<v Speaker 4>It was the moonshine that was behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting it could've been any.</v>

2180
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:35.420
<v Speaker 4>So we finally make it to camp and we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing a film,</v>

2181
01:35:35.421 --> 01:35:40.421
<v Speaker 4>so they're filming me while I'm all </v>
<v Speaker 4>messed up and I was kind of out of it.</v>

2182
01:35:40.491 --> 01:35:45.491
<v Speaker 4>I mean we're coming down this switchback</v>
<v Speaker 4>trail to go into camp and I remember </v>

2183
01:35:45.621 --> 01:35:48.800
<v Speaker 4>like not I much like when I fell I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2184
01:35:48.801 --> 01:35:53.801
<v Speaker 4>I'm aware that my feet are hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground and these trekking poles are </v>

2185
01:35:53.801 --> 01:35:53.801
<v Speaker 4>hitting the ground and like I'm aware </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I'm doing this,</v>

2186
01:35:53.801 --> 01:35:56.120
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't control it.</v>

2187
01:35:56.210 --> 01:35:58.760
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I could be floating through </v>
<v Speaker 4>the air just as well as walking.</v>

2188
01:35:59.030 --> 01:36:01.430
<v Speaker 4>He a weird like head detached from body </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeling.</v>

2189
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:06.790
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was gnarly and I'm at the end of the </v>

2190
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:11.770
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what they thought was like it </v>

2191
01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:13.691
<v Speaker 4>was the sickness that everybody else got</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming on at the same time as altitude </v>

2192
01:36:13.691 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 4>and it was just my body was fighting </v>
<v Speaker 4>this battle against itself.</v>

2193
01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:22.960
<v Speaker 4>So we got back to camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I just kinda sat in a chair for </v>

2194
01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:22.960
<v Speaker 4>awhile and said a lot of weird stuff.</v>

2195
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:28.700
<v Speaker 6>I think I said like a</v>

2196
01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.620
<v Speaker 4>when I think I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2197
01:36:30.621 --> 01:36:35.621
<v Speaker 4>what's the name of this mountain?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because that's you got to know the name </v>

2198
01:36:35.621 --> 01:36:38.421
<v Speaker 4>of what's going to kill you or something</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird like don't this mountains out to </v>

2199
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:38.421
<v Speaker 4>get us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

2200
01:36:38.421 --> 01:36:39.690
<v Speaker 4>were you thinking about your family?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:40.680
<v Speaker 4>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2202
01:36:40.710 --> 01:36:42.120
<v Speaker 4>That's the first thing you think about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2203
01:36:42.121 --> 01:36:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Sharing the bad situation in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why did I come here?</v>

2204
01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:48.530
<v Speaker 4>Why do I have to be this adventuring </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole and that,</v>

2205
01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:50.160
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that 100 percent.</v>

2206
01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:55.220
<v Speaker 4>I think I was more focused on levity and</v>
<v Speaker 4>more focused on like making jokes and </v>

2207
01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:57.780
<v Speaker 4>making it seem okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2208
01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.090
<v Speaker 4>Because that's the only way that my mind</v>
<v Speaker 4>can wrap ourselves around.</v>

2209
01:37:00.091 --> 01:37:00.360
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2210
01:37:00.361 --> 01:37:01.440
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you dumb ass.</v>

2211
01:37:01.441 --> 01:37:03.180
<v Speaker 4>You trained for a month.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went to Nepal,</v>

2212
01:37:03.181 --> 01:37:04.560
<v Speaker 4>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're an idiot.</v>

2213
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:06.960
<v Speaker 4>You get a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll live in Texas.</v>

2214
01:37:06.961 --> 01:37:07.090
<v Speaker 4>You.</v>

2215
01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:12.170
<v Speaker 6>This is what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck are you do?</v>

2216
01:37:13.461 --> 01:37:14.830
<v Speaker 6>And this is your brain and body.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Are you</v>

2217
01:37:14.840 --> 01:37:17.190
<v Speaker 4>telling you dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't do this.</v>

2218
01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.200
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But at the same time I'm like,</v>

2219
01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:20.970
<v Speaker 4>I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

2220
01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:22.860
<v Speaker 4>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this place,</v>

2221
01:37:22.861 --> 01:37:23.790
<v Speaker 4>the feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the spirit,</v>

2222
01:37:23.820 --> 01:37:25.800
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you got to get through it.</v>

2223
01:37:25.890 --> 01:37:27.680
<v Speaker 4>Like if there was anything to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>through then you,</v>

2224
01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:32.980
<v Speaker 4>it would be this like and so you get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got hardened to that fact and I think </v>

2225
01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.480
<v Speaker 4>eventually I had some water and I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>to sleep and I woke up in the middle of </v>

2226
01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:41.601
<v Speaker 4>the night and Ben,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the magic was in the 10th question is a </v>

2227
01:37:41.601 --> 01:37:41.910
<v Speaker 4>little medical bag and sleeping in there</v>
<v Speaker 4>with me.</v>

2228
01:37:42.330 --> 01:37:43.710
<v Speaker 4>So it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that serious.</v>

2229
01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:46.410
<v Speaker 4>I think they had a discussion while I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was sleeping about do we just.</v>

2230
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:48.090
<v Speaker 4>Does he wake up in a helicopter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2231
01:37:48.210 --> 01:37:52.590
<v Speaker 4>does he wake up going back to Kathmandu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is probably the right conversation</v>

2232
01:37:52.591 --> 01:37:54.420
<v Speaker 4>to have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a Bob Seger song.</v>

2233
01:37:55.620 --> 01:37:55.990
<v Speaker 4>Wake it</v>

2234
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.730
<v Speaker 1>up and Katmandu.</v>

2235
01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.280
<v Speaker 6>That's right.</v>

2236
01:38:02.910 --> 01:38:07.910
<v Speaker 1>A baby and a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you tell anybody about the baby or </v>

2237
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:10.500
<v Speaker 1>the baby?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually.</v>

2238
01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right at the moment.</v>

2239
01:38:12.031 --> 01:38:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Then the baby was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2240
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:14.850
<v Speaker 1>listen baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2241
01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make a pact.</v>

2242
01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:18.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to keep you under wraps for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile.</v>

2243
01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:22.800
<v Speaker 1>So you're basically like tripping balls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah I don't know the science of it.</v>

2244
01:38:22.801 --> 01:38:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Somebody smarter than me can tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what actually was going on,</v>

2245
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.920
<v Speaker 1>whether I was just a pussy or there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>some actual scientific stuff going down.</v>

2246
01:38:32.590 --> 01:38:35.870
<v Speaker 1>Parker joint since it's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's legal here in California.</v>

2247
01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.860
<v Speaker 1>It's just hit me hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep going.</v>

2248
01:38:37.890 --> 01:38:39.960
<v Speaker 4>I'll keep going while you're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2249
01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:46.160
<v Speaker 4>so the next day there's more to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>story to tell.</v>

2250
01:38:46.831 --> 01:38:51.831
<v Speaker 4>There's probably so much detail but the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next day we get up and I'm feeling okay.</v>

2251
01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.970
<v Speaker 4>Feeling pretty weak.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Ah,</v>

2252
01:38:56.971 --> 01:38:59.520
<v Speaker 4>this is still not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not poisoning week.</v>

2253
01:38:59.790 --> 01:39:04.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that weird thing where you feel </v>

2254
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:05.040
<v Speaker 4>like you can't really make a fist like </v>
<v Speaker 4>achy kinda.</v>

2255
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:08.520
<v Speaker 4>So we did a little bit of filming in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>morning and it was like,</v>

2256
01:39:08.521 --> 01:39:13.521
<v Speaker 4>hey o'brian,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can you make it up for this acclamation </v>

2257
01:39:13.521 --> 01:39:13.560
<v Speaker 4>hike?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2258
01:39:13.561 --> 01:39:15.740
<v Speaker 4>Can you go up this hill right here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>

2259
01:39:17.970 --> 01:39:18.600
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2260
01:39:20.110 --> 01:39:21.790
<v Speaker 4>can you make it up this hill right here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can,</v>

2261
01:39:21.791 --> 01:39:25.030
<v Speaker 4>we'll let you keep going kind of deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they give you a test.</v>

2262
01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:29.060
<v Speaker 4>I could test you on Brad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I get up there.</v>

2263
01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:30.570
<v Speaker 4>I'd go with one of the guides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Roger,</v>

2264
01:39:30.700 --> 01:39:32.380
<v Speaker 4>let me get up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We started hiking.</v>

2265
01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.350
<v Speaker 4>We get up over this rise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm feeling pretty good shit.</v>

2266
01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:38.680
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a bad moment in time.</v>

2267
01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:40.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we're back.</v>

2268
01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:41.380
<v Speaker 4>Sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on when sheep.</v>

2269
01:39:41.410 --> 01:39:43.060
<v Speaker 4>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we're going.</v>

2270
01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.900
<v Speaker 4>I think we probably had five or six hour</v>
<v Speaker 4>hike into the next camp.</v>

2271
01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.800
<v Speaker 4>We started getting into sheep country at</v>
<v Speaker 4>that time and um,</v>

2272
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:54.250
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're hiking and I'm feeling pretty good</v>

2273
01:39:54.251 --> 01:39:59.251
<v Speaker 4>and we get to a spot where our main </v>
<v Speaker 4>guide mon had spotted some sheep and so </v>

2274
01:40:01.301 --> 01:40:05.200
<v Speaker 4>we get to where he had spotted some </v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep and I'm feeling tired.</v>

2275
01:40:05.201 --> 01:40:07.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're going up as we go,</v>

2276
01:40:07.391 --> 01:40:09.880
<v Speaker 4>so we may be there 14,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>feet or 13,</v>

2277
01:40:09.881 --> 01:40:12.430
<v Speaker 4>five at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2278
01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.540
<v Speaker 4>we sit down and he's glass and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sheet,</v>

2279
01:40:15.541 --> 01:40:17.000
<v Speaker 4>but I remember glass and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2280
01:40:17.001 --> 01:40:19.160
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were like so far up,</v>

2281
01:40:19.161 --> 01:40:21.020
<v Speaker 4>you can't imagine going that far to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2282
01:40:22.090 --> 01:40:23.720
<v Speaker 4>And then I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my stomach just like,</v>

2283
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:25.400
<v Speaker 4>oh no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

2284
01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:28.790
<v Speaker 4>my stomach is completely screwed.</v>

2285
01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:34.450
<v Speaker 1>But start going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get that muscle but muscle or your </v>

2286
01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:39.220
<v Speaker 1>butt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're holding a weight that </v>

2287
01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:39.220
<v Speaker 1>you're going to drop.</v>

2288
01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:40.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what I was good.</v>

2289
01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:46.160
<v Speaker 6>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let me say this about shitting your </v>

2290
01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:48.251
<v Speaker 6>pants.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody on this,</v>

2291
01:40:48.540 --> 01:40:48.600
<v Speaker 6>on this</v>

2292
01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.060
<v Speaker 1>trip was okay with it because it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

2293
01:40:51.450 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>It was shitting their pants was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like</v>

2294
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.240
<v Speaker 4>you're on a plane and it was like our </v>
<v Speaker 4>camera guy.</v>

2295
01:40:57.250 --> 01:40:59.920
<v Speaker 4>One of our main camera guys are non.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who was an amazing person.</v>

2296
01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:05.660
<v Speaker 4>The whole nother podcast about that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He shit his pants I think during like </v>

2297
01:41:06.031 --> 01:41:08.560
<v Speaker 4>day one and I don't know how many pairs </v>
<v Speaker 4>of pants he had,</v>

2298
01:41:08.561 --> 01:41:11.530
<v Speaker 4>but I remember watching him like </v>
<v Speaker 4>scrubbing the shit out of his pants,</v>

2299
01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:15.160
<v Speaker 4>thinking shit that's going to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting,</v>

2300
01:41:15.730 --> 01:41:20.730
<v Speaker 4>but by the time we got into sheep </v>
<v Speaker 4>country we were all okay with the </v>

2301
01:41:20.730 --> 01:41:21.310
<v Speaker 4>occasional short or whatever's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's fine</v>

2302
01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:26.540
<v Speaker 5>because your body's just like you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>realizing that your mind has a </v>

2303
01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:26.540
<v Speaker 5>directive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right,</v>

2304
01:41:26.540 --> 01:41:28.320
<v Speaker 5>but your body is dealing with some </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty extreme conditions</v>

2305
01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:33.330
<v Speaker 4>and I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always wonder now looking back on it </v>

2306
01:41:33.330 --> 01:41:35.461
<v Speaker 4>or like how well I would have done if </v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't sickness and like I had </v>

2307
01:41:35.461 --> 01:41:38.581
<v Speaker 4>some stuff like go to Katmandu and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>just dust and dirt and all this </v>

2308
01:41:38.581 --> 01:41:41.560
<v Speaker 4>craziness and I had going into it like </v>
<v Speaker 4>respiratory issues and then sickness and</v>

2309
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:46.140
<v Speaker 4>then visions of things and so by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time you get in there,</v>

2310
01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.490
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really makes you respect the fuck out</v>

2311
01:41:49.491 --> 01:41:50.740
<v Speaker 5>of Jim shockey.</v>

2312
01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:52.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2313
01:41:52.170 --> 01:41:54.540
<v Speaker 5>For people who don't know who jim </v>
<v Speaker 5>shockey is,</v>

2314
01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:59.400
<v Speaker 5>Jim shockey is extremely respected in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hunting world.</v>

2315
01:41:59.610 --> 01:42:02.130
<v Speaker 5>The,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just step aside with that.</v>

2316
01:42:02.131 --> 01:42:06.570
<v Speaker 5>He's an amazing accomplished hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe even more important than that.</v>

2317
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:11.870
<v Speaker 5>He's got a show called uncharted and his</v>
<v Speaker 5>uncharted show is so good.</v>

2318
01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.800
<v Speaker 5>It's so good that it really shouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 5>considered a hunting show because what </v>

2319
01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.391
<v Speaker 5>it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is him exploring cultures in the most </v>

2320
01:42:23.391 --> 01:42:27.051
<v Speaker 5>remote parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jim goes to these strange villages in </v>

2321
01:42:27.051 --> 01:42:28.910
<v Speaker 5>the middle of Russia that no one goes</v>

2322
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:30.620
<v Speaker 4>to Ivan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got all kinds of stories.</v>

2323
01:42:30.621 --> 01:42:32.710
<v Speaker 4>Like last time I was at Jim's place up </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Canada.</v>

2324
01:42:32.711 --> 01:42:33.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

2325
01:42:33.411 --> 01:42:33.770
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2326
01:42:33.771 --> 01:42:34.790
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing this weekend?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2327
01:42:34.810 --> 01:42:36.040
<v Speaker 4>I fly home,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hang out with the family.</v>

2328
01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:36.620
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2329
01:42:36.621 --> 01:42:38.720
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bison and Poland,</v>

2330
01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:43.040
<v Speaker 4>they have bison and that's what I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>is what he said.</v>

2331
01:42:43.041 --> 01:42:47.240
<v Speaker 4>I can be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can be the same kind of thing.</v>

2332
01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:47.790
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2333
01:42:47.890 --> 01:42:49.250
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was,</v>

2334
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:53.240
<v Speaker 4>I saw Jim about a month before we left </v>
<v Speaker 4>for Nepal and Jim had been at,</v>

2335
01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.890
<v Speaker 4>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you can find foot,</v>

2336
01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:58.340
<v Speaker 4>the full episode of Jim's Nepal Hunt </v>
<v Speaker 4>with his crew.</v>

2337
01:42:58.550 --> 01:43:00.220
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2338
01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:02.510
<v Speaker 4>They filmed it there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like doing cell filming.</v>

2339
01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:05.080
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of how I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like you're just a,</v>

2340
01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.790
<v Speaker 4>you're just a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a mess.</v>

2341
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:11.170
<v Speaker 4>And I said to him as like going into </v>
<v Speaker 4>Paul,</v>

2342
01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:12.440
<v Speaker 4>Jim and like a month,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he goes,</v>

2343
01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:14.100
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2344
01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:15.290
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2345
01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:16.310
<v Speaker 4>what can I expect?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2346
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:19.340
<v Speaker 4>it sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sucks.</v>

2347
01:43:19.341 --> 01:43:22.970
<v Speaker 4>And when somebody like Jim shockey who's</v>
<v Speaker 4>traveled the world,</v>

2348
01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:25.190
<v Speaker 4>literally the world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it says,</v>

2349
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:27.860
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be terrible for you little</v>
<v Speaker 4>fellow.</v>

2350
01:43:28.410 --> 01:43:29.540
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh no,</v>

2351
01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.090
<v Speaker 4>this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm going to be in trouble.</v>

2352
01:43:33.090 --> 01:43:38.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jim shockey has a a video or a,</v>

2353
01:43:38.071 --> 01:43:43.071
<v Speaker 5>an episode of his show where he went to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it was Mozambique where they're </v>

2354
01:43:43.091 --> 01:43:45.570
<v Speaker 5>hunting crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crocodiles,</v>

2355
01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:48.780
<v Speaker 5>eat all the people that work that live </v>
<v Speaker 5>and work in this village.</v>

2356
01:43:48.781 --> 01:43:50.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is so crazy.</v>

2357
01:43:50.341 --> 01:43:55.341
<v Speaker 5>These poor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These people live under the threat of </v>

2358
01:43:55.341 --> 01:43:58.451
<v Speaker 5>monsters on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like half the people in the village are </v>

2359
01:43:58.451 --> 01:44:00.740
<v Speaker 5>either missing arms or they have a chunk</v>
<v Speaker 5>taken out of their leg and one they were</v>

2360
01:44:00.741 --> 01:44:01.940
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They lost a woman.</v>

2361
01:44:02.210 --> 01:44:05.600
<v Speaker 5>She was going down there either to fetch</v>
<v Speaker 5>water to wash her clothes,</v>

2362
01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:10.280
<v Speaker 5>and she got taken out and these people </v>
<v Speaker 5>were screaming and weeping.</v>

2363
01:44:10.281 --> 01:44:15.050
<v Speaker 5>It was so hard to watch man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to watch a bunch of people wailing,</v>

2364
01:44:15.230 --> 01:44:20.230
<v Speaker 5>just wailing because they knew this </v>
<v Speaker 5>woman that they loved got taken under.</v>

2365
01:44:22.101 --> 01:44:27.101
<v Speaker 5>By the end of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the end of it where they cut the croc </v>

2366
01:44:27.101 --> 01:44:27.880
<v Speaker 5>open and pulled a.</v>

2367
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:32.890
<v Speaker 5>What was it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a shoe or something out of the </v>

2368
01:44:32.890 --> 01:44:32.890
<v Speaker 5>cracks belly shirt or something like </v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

2369
01:44:32.890 --> 01:44:37.690
<v Speaker 5>I remember we were talking about that </v>
<v Speaker 5>later on and that should be on a </v>

2370
01:44:37.821 --> 01:44:40.250
<v Speaker 5>different channel.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's so good.</v>

2371
01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.670
<v Speaker 5>It's so it should be on discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's his son's name that films it?</v>

2372
01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:47.090
<v Speaker 5>Brantlyn brand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Linda's a motherfucker.</v>

2373
01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:50.120
<v Speaker 5>He is a bad motherfucker family.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Either their daughter,</v>

2374
01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:55.150
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>here's my criticism of outdoor in air </v>

2375
01:44:55.150 --> 01:44:59.561
<v Speaker 5>quotes TV.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's episodes like Rainelda's that </v>

2376
01:44:59.561 --> 01:45:01.500
<v Speaker 5>are just brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean Rinella show or shows rather like</v>

2377
01:45:01.630 --> 01:45:04.250
<v Speaker 5>Rainelda's Rinella show is just a </v>
<v Speaker 5>brilliant show.</v>

2378
01:45:04.251 --> 01:45:06.620
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it easily could be on any other network.</v>

2379
01:45:06.621 --> 01:45:09.680
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's shot by zero point zero.</v>

2380
01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:14.681
<v Speaker 5>The same people that shoot Anthony </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bourdain's show the same people that </v>

2381
01:45:14.681 --> 01:45:16.520
<v Speaker 5>shoot a ton of award winning Emmy Award </v>
<v Speaker 5>winning shows.</v>

2382
01:45:16.521 --> 01:45:21.521
<v Speaker 5>It's a brilliant show and then you got </v>
<v Speaker 5>these things that look like they shoot </v>

2383
01:45:21.521 --> 01:45:22.370
<v Speaker 5>them with trail cams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a bunch of dip shits.</v>

2384
01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:23.570
<v Speaker 5>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2385
01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:24.440
<v Speaker 5>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2386
01:45:24.441 --> 01:45:27.290
<v Speaker 5>the Lord blessed me when this bull came </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the ridge,</v>

2387
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.640
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

2388
01:45:27.650 --> 01:45:30.260
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they just think there's a.</v>

2389
01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:35.340
<v Speaker 5>I'm a rampant anti-intellectualism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like an embraced sort of like a fake </v>

2390
01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:41.120
<v Speaker 5>simplicity to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2391
01:45:41.121 --> 01:45:44.000
<v Speaker 5>There's like heartland pandering that </v>
<v Speaker 5>goes on all the pandering,</v>

2392
01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.100
<v Speaker 5>pandering,</v>
<v Speaker 5>skidway look,</v>

2393
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:50.290
<v Speaker 5>but then you've got Jim shockey who has </v>
<v Speaker 5>this legitimate appreciation for these </v>

2394
01:45:50.930 --> 01:45:54.380
<v Speaker 5>cultures that he visits all over the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

2395
01:45:54.381 --> 01:45:59.381
<v Speaker 5>I mean he goes to these incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 5>remote places and communicates with </v>

2396
01:45:59.381 --> 01:46:03.461
<v Speaker 5>these tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people that live in the jungle or the </v>

2397
01:46:03.461 --> 01:46:06.881
<v Speaker 5>mountains or wherever it is and you </v>
<v Speaker 5>could tell that this is a guy jim is </v>

2398
01:46:06.881 --> 01:46:06.881
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does he buy?</v>

2399
01:46:06.881 --> 01:46:10.100
<v Speaker 5>Probably 60 or so that he's getting up </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and he,</v>

2400
01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:15.460
<v Speaker 5>he realizes that he's lived a long life,</v>
<v Speaker 5>has experienced a lot of wild and </v>

2401
01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:20.171
<v Speaker 5>amazing things and now at this point in </v>
<v Speaker 5>life what he really desires or extreme </v>

2402
01:46:20.171 --> 01:46:24.011
<v Speaker 5>experiences of a humankind and also have</v>
<v Speaker 5>a wildcard in nature and was like a </v>

2403
01:46:25.731 --> 01:46:29.760
<v Speaker 5>different level to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I outdoor TV,</v>

2404
01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:34.840
<v Speaker 5>they is funny just because like I do </v>
<v Speaker 5>appreciate and have friends that are </v>

2405
01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.110
<v Speaker 5>like fall into that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2406
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:37.140
<v Speaker 5>bubble zone buzzbuzzhome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2407
01:46:37.230 --> 01:46:42.230
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I appreciate what they do and like </v>

2408
01:46:42.230 --> 01:46:42.380
<v Speaker 5>it's not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't watch it and I'm a fan of it,</v>

2409
01:46:42.381 --> 01:46:44.680
<v Speaker 5>but I appreciate it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Other bubbles like it and it's a thing,</v>

2410
01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:45.760
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2411
01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.540
<v Speaker 5>it's hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right.</v>

2412
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:50.040
<v Speaker 5>But I will agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's</v>

2413
01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.380
<v Speaker 4>on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's just a different level you could</v>

2414
01:46:52.381 --> 01:46:55.980
<v Speaker 4>watch Rinella is cuzdey or episode where</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just kind of like,</v>

2415
01:46:56.130 --> 01:47:01.130
<v Speaker 4>the whole theme is like sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 4>silence and like if you're looking for </v>

2416
01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:04.401
<v Speaker 4>the right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about his dad talking about </v>

2417
01:47:04.401 --> 01:47:04.890
<v Speaker 4>growing up and there's no music.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this brilliant episode.</v>

2418
01:47:04.891 --> 01:47:09.891
<v Speaker 4>It's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you could watch something like </v>

2419
01:47:09.891 --> 01:47:10.890
<v Speaker 4>that and then every once in a while </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll see one where you're like,</v>

2420
01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:16.340
<v Speaker 4>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like there's such a juxtaposition </v>

2421
01:47:16.340 --> 01:47:20.961
<v Speaker 4>between what Steve and Jim and some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these other Hartland bowhunter these </v>

2422
01:47:20.961 --> 01:47:22.080
<v Speaker 4>guys were able to like even </v>
<v Speaker 4>cinematically produce.</v>

2423
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:23.230
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Heartland bowhunter,</v>

2424
01:47:23.231 --> 01:47:27.390
<v Speaker 5>they do a really good job with their </v>
<v Speaker 5>editing and footage and they do</v>

2425
01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:32.500
<v Speaker 4>really good job in remy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like solo hunters are really great </v>

2426
01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:32.680
<v Speaker 4>timber timber net.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2427
01:47:32.681 --> 01:47:35.920
<v Speaker 4>and so like there is this really good </v>
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>

2428
01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:40.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if they're pulling up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ones that aren't so good or they're </v>

2429
01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:42.160
<v Speaker 4>being brought down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>

2430
01:47:42.650 --> 01:47:43.930
<v Speaker 5>I think it's either or,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2431
01:47:43.931 --> 01:47:44.690
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what?</v>

2432
01:47:44.691 --> 01:47:46.940
<v Speaker 5>Another one of my favorite is western </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunter.</v>

2433
01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.340
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's an amazing show.</v>

2434
01:47:49.410 --> 01:47:50.240
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and nate,</v>

2435
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:52.700
<v Speaker 5>Nate Simmons is fucking so good on that.</v>

2436
01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:54.550
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I will say as a hunter,</v>

2437
01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 4>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you really all you care about </v>

2438
01:47:59.820 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 4>hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just want to read,</v>

2439
01:47:59.820 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 4>read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>read.</v>

2440
01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:04.260
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of bad information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot on television in </v>

2441
01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:04.260
<v Speaker 4>television and</v>

2442
01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:09.780
<v Speaker 5>got like western hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is a lot of really good </v>

2443
01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:12.091
<v Speaker 5>information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's public land and what he does is go </v>

2444
01:48:12.091 --> 01:48:14.710
<v Speaker 5>deep into the back country hiking sets </v>
<v Speaker 5>up camp and does it the hard way.</v>

2445
01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:18.880
<v Speaker 5>That's the real hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of the man.</v>

2446
01:48:18.881 --> 01:48:23.881
<v Speaker 5>It's hard to tell people that to tune </v>
<v Speaker 5>into a show if they've never had any </v>

2447
01:48:23.881 --> 01:48:24.730
<v Speaker 5>appreciation whatsoever for hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be hard.</v>

2448
01:48:24.850 --> 01:48:26.710
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What showed you tuned into,</v>

2449
01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:27.960
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>

2450
01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:29.950
<v Speaker 5>I mean it would be there in my,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's three.</v>

2451
01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:33.700
<v Speaker 5>I feel like western hunter,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a few like into the back country</v>

2452
01:48:33.701 --> 01:48:35.500
<v Speaker 5>is really good too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but meat eaters,</v>

2453
01:48:35.501 --> 01:48:36.730
<v Speaker 5>probably the one that would send them </v>
<v Speaker 5>to.</v>

2454
01:48:37.020 --> 01:48:42.020
<v Speaker 5>I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>narration that you're going to get and </v>

2455
01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:44.820
<v Speaker 5>the intellectual understanding of like </v>
<v Speaker 5>how to present these subjects and how to</v>

2456
01:48:48.140 --> 01:48:48.800
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2457
01:48:48.801 --> 01:48:50.210
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's important to me.</v>

2458
01:48:50.211 --> 01:48:55.211
<v Speaker 4>Like as I get along in my life and </v>
<v Speaker 4>career and like I have a son now and </v>

2459
01:48:55.211 --> 01:48:56.450
<v Speaker 4>I've trying to figure out what I want </v>
<v Speaker 4>him to know.</v>

2460
01:48:57.740 --> 01:48:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Like it's important to me that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2461
01:48:59.570 --> 01:49:04.570
<v Speaker 4>There's people like Steven now out there</v>
<v Speaker 4>representing kind of my thoughts and </v>

2462
01:49:04.570 --> 01:49:05.000
<v Speaker 4>feelings in a way that I probably </v>
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>

2463
01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:05.930
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2464
01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.870
<v Speaker 4>so I don't want to try.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to struggle with that.</v>

2465
01:49:08.871 --> 01:49:10.610
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to like if he says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey dad,</v>

2466
01:49:10.611 --> 01:49:12.050
<v Speaker 4>let's watch them outdoor channel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to be like,</v>

2467
01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.500
<v Speaker 4>oh I dunno man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2468
01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:15.080
<v Speaker 4>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2469
01:49:15.170 --> 01:49:17.380
<v Speaker 4>I do appreciate Steve for what he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a,</v>

2470
01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.340
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of them that are really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

2471
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:25.330
<v Speaker 4>And I guess I would say at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the day I've always struggled with being</v>

2472
01:49:26.241 --> 01:49:31.241
<v Speaker 4>in a room full of hunters and watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>the outdoor channel because we're </v>

2473
01:49:31.241 --> 01:49:33.230
<v Speaker 4>hypercritical of every little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like why did he draw,</v>

2474
01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:35.510
<v Speaker 4>why not draw?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well there's that,</v>

2475
01:49:35.511 --> 01:49:37.890
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's different to me.</v>

2476
01:49:37.900 --> 01:49:42.900
<v Speaker 4>I think that flows into the actual,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the quality of the content and how </v>

2477
01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:42.900
<v Speaker 4>you know it because</v>

2478
01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:47.280
<v Speaker 5>I feel like if I'm watching Nate Simmons</v>
<v Speaker 5>or Steve Rinell or Ramey warrant and </v>

2479
01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 5>those guys I don't think should be </v>
<v Speaker 5>second guessing</v>

2480
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:50.220
<v Speaker 2>what those guys do in the field because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2481
01:49:50.221 --> 01:49:50.790
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2482
01:49:50.791 --> 01:49:55.791
<v Speaker 2>you have a level of proficiency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To me that's like the layman watching </v>

2483
01:49:55.791 --> 01:49:58.020
<v Speaker 2>UFC fight and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't conor punch him there?</v>

2484
01:49:58.330 --> 01:50:02.140
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking crazy.</v>

2485
01:50:02.380 --> 01:50:04.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't think he knows when to punch </v>
<v Speaker 2>and when not to punch.</v>

2486
01:50:04.811 --> 01:50:06.400
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a stupid way of looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2487
01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:09.580
<v Speaker 2>So if you would compare the UFC to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting television,</v>

2488
01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:11.800
<v Speaker 2>there is no meter for how you get on </v>
<v Speaker 2>hunting television.</v>

2489
01:50:11.801 --> 01:50:14.440
<v Speaker 2>You have money and you buy air time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there,</v>

2490
01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:15.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just no,</v>

2491
01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.000
<v Speaker 2>there's no qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll explain that because most people </v>

2492
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:21.000
<v Speaker 2>have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So on the outdoor channel and sports.</v>

2493
01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.501
<v Speaker 2>So I can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to put a show on comedy </v>

2494
01:50:25.501 --> 01:50:25.501
<v Speaker 2>central,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to make a deal with comedy.</v>

2495
01:50:25.501 --> 01:50:29.140
<v Speaker 2>Central is good for real producers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for real writers.</v>

2496
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to pack a jet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to invest in it.</v>

2497
01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:34.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a big deal to get to launch it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right after tosh point.</v>

2498
01:50:34.871 --> 01:50:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on whatever.</v>

2499
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:38.590
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be invested in it too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If is good.</v>

2500
01:50:38.591 --> 01:50:43.591
<v Speaker 2>We do good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody combined and the cable </v>

2501
01:50:43.591 --> 01:50:45.640
<v Speaker 2>channels that are outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sportsmans channel is the business model</v>

2502
01:50:45.641 --> 01:50:47.160
<v Speaker 2>is not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you.</v>

2503
01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:51.940
<v Speaker 2>You pay the network for the air time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially you deliver them content.</v>

2504
01:50:51.941 --> 01:50:54.790
<v Speaker 2>They have very little oversight over </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you delivered them.</v>

2505
01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:59.791
<v Speaker 2>There's rules.</v>

01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:06.040
<v Speaker 2>They have rules on how many times you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can show a kill shot fairly sure because</v>

2511
01:51:06.110 --> 01:51:11.110
<v Speaker 2>you can't like shoot a deer two minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the episode and just dash is washed</v>

<v Speaker 2>The Arrow goes a close up on the Arrow </v>

2513
01:51:19.300 --> 01:51:23.881
<v Speaker 2>is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We brought that red cameras all death </v>

<v Speaker 2>metal and dying feet up in the air,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kicking chicken or the egg.</v>

2515

<v Speaker 2>There can be a show like that of Nutty </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking chose those of you that are like</v>

2516

01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:46.111
<v Speaker 2>So there are God right there are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to be diplomatic and rugged </v>

2518
01:51:47.420 --> 01:51:49.020
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are um,</v>

2519
01:51:49.330 --> 01:51:54.330
<v Speaker 2>some really good shows but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you pay and there's some shows that </v>

2520
01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:54.330
<v Speaker 2>are owned by the network,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is the,</v>

2521
01:51:54.330 --> 01:51:57.070
<v Speaker 2>the minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of shows are people who are</v>

2522
01:51:57.071 --> 01:52:02.071
<v Speaker 2>paying for air time and then companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>come in and sponsor their show and pay </v>

2523
01:52:02.071 --> 01:52:05.671
<v Speaker 2>that for that for now.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't believe this baby.</v>

2589
01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:17.360
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a show in the wilds of New </v>

2590
01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:21.580
<v Speaker 2>Mexico in September.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wanted to visit this native </v>

2591
01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:24.581
<v Speaker 2>American reservation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out that they invited me to </v>

2592
01:55:24.581 --> 01:55:24.581
<v Speaker 2>hunt bison there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2593
01:55:24.581 --> 01:55:25.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

2594
01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:27.900
<v Speaker 2>But I don't want to 75 people coming to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show.</v>

2595
01:55:27.901 --> 01:55:30.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be disrespectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2596
01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:32.870
<v Speaker 2>strange times it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

2597
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:37.990
<v Speaker 2>I must not like I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every once in a while I'll flick on a </v>

2598
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.270
<v Speaker 2>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 2>CNN or something,</v>

2599
01:55:38.271 --> 01:55:39.680
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not one of those people.</v>

2600
01:55:39.681 --> 01:55:44.681
<v Speaker 2>I've seen people in my life that gets so</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrapped up in that stuff that it </v>

2601
01:55:44.681 --> 01:55:44.681
<v Speaker 2>becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes their reality.</v>

2602
01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:48.390
<v Speaker 4>I've never been affected by anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald Trump has done in my daily life.</v>

2603
01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.190
<v Speaker 4>The healthcare thing is a different </v>
<v Speaker 4>deal,</v>

2604
01:55:50.191 --> 01:55:53.280
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think in my daily life there's few</v>

2605
01:55:53.281 --> 01:55:58.281
<v Speaker 4>things that directly affect me other </v>
<v Speaker 4>than something that seems existential </v>

2606
01:55:58.281 --> 01:55:59.780
<v Speaker 4>other than the environment and freaking </v>
<v Speaker 4>healthcare.</v>

2607
01:55:59.980 --> 01:56:04.980
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't even affect you or you </v>

2608
01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:04.980
<v Speaker 2>feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ignore it.</v>

2609
01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:07.480
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the problem is that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't like on a day to day basis.</v>

2610
01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:10.420
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't touch your skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make your.</v>

2611
01:56:10.450 --> 01:56:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Your nerve endings responds so you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose.</v>

2612
01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:14.440
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a choice,</v>

2613
01:56:14.441 --> 01:56:14.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2614
01:56:14.650 --> 01:56:15.970
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could choose to not.</v>

2615
01:56:16.510 --> 01:56:21.510
<v Speaker 4>You can choose to create some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>bubble for that news and politics and </v>

2616
01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:25.270
<v Speaker 4>let only what's important in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's Kinda what I try to do.</v>

2617
01:56:25.271 --> 01:56:30.271
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if I'm always doing it,</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's there if you've never had one and </v>

2692

<v Speaker 2>people go loose spoons with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>

2693
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:43.540
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to have one,</v>

2694
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:48.750
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you if you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and you want a crazy fucking </v>

2695

<v Speaker 2>cooler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are the shit.</v>

2696
01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.160
<v Speaker 2>This is very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you feel about the ones that.</v>

2697
01:59:51.161 --> 01:59:52.780
<v Speaker 2>There's one that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2698
01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:57.840
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that totally copied Yeti like in every </v>

2699
01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:58.210
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

2700
01:59:58.211 --> 02:00:03.211
<v Speaker 2>they copied the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very flattering the way the logo </v>

2701
02:00:03.211 --> 02:00:03.910
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone was saying,</v>

2702
02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:08.940
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one is like half the price and it </v>

2703
02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:08.940
<v Speaker 2>does just as good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2704
02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:12.900
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there was like this battle </v>

2705
02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:14.610
<v Speaker 2>after I posted that in the comment </v>
<v Speaker 2>section of instagram where people like </v>

2706
02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:14.610
<v Speaker 2>their copycats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no,</v>

2707
02:00:14.610 --> 02:00:15.870
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is debates.</v>

2708
02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a good robust debate on </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the better cooler.</v>

2709
02:00:19.361 --> 02:00:22.240
<v Speaker 2>It's funny that Yeti has kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>

2710
02:00:22.380 --> 02:00:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I created the premium cooler category </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

2711
02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:27.070
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you create a category like that</v>

2712
02:00:27.071 --> 02:00:30.520
<v Speaker 2>when you and become a business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet he is,</v>

2713
02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:35.850
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have people that follow </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and they kind of need us and we </v>

2714
02:00:35.850 --> 02:00:36.070
<v Speaker 2>kinda need them unless whatever.</v>

2715
02:00:36.070 --> 02:00:41.070
<v Speaker 2>But as long as there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not infringing on the things </v>

2716
02:00:41.070 --> 02:00:41.740
<v Speaker 2>that are our intellectual property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things of that nature.</v>

2717
02:00:42.670 --> 02:00:45.910
<v Speaker 2>As far as that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know as a company man,</v>

2718
02:00:45.911 --> 02:00:48.400
<v Speaker 2>we look forward like we have stuff we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out with now.</v>

2719
02:00:48.401 --> 02:00:50.740
<v Speaker 2>Things we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not worried about people that are,</v>

2720
02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:52.130
<v Speaker 2>that are copying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is.</v>

2721
02:00:52.131 --> 02:00:56.070
<v Speaker 2>I'll just continue to follow along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look coolers,</v>

2722
02:00:56.110 --> 02:00:57.880
<v Speaker 2>coolers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all good.</v>

2723
02:00:57.881 --> 02:00:59.660
<v Speaker 2>But what I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

2724
02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:02.230
<v Speaker 2>when I find something that I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>

2725
02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I like to tell people about it and for </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason people always assess why</v>

2726
02:01:06.401 --> 02:01:08.560
<v Speaker 2>is that such a hard thing to get their </v>
<v Speaker 2>heads around?</v>

2727
02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>

2728
02:01:09.281 --> 02:01:12.670
<v Speaker 2>they're cynical and they should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people are full of shit.</v>

2729
02:01:12.671 --> 02:01:14.110
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that are full of</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

2730
02:01:14.770 --> 02:01:19.770
<v Speaker 2>But I swear to fucking God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's ever a time where I have an </v>

2731
02:01:19.770 --> 02:01:20.650
<v Speaker 2>ad for like the ads for my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows their ads.</v>

2732
02:01:21.010 --> 02:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>People pay for those ads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we were talking about it,</v>

2733
02:01:23.111 --> 02:01:24.190
<v Speaker 2>that was my argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2734
02:01:24.880 --> 02:01:27.610
<v Speaker 2>people pay for ads and Joe reads the ad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never,</v>

2735
02:01:27.640 --> 02:01:30.370
<v Speaker 2>he never just like frozen during a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pocket pockets,</v>

2736
02:01:30.371 --> 02:01:30.870
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And that's like Stevia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have zero.</v>

2739
02:01:36.041 --> 02:01:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I bought this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ran out.</v>

2740
02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>I ordered these all on Amazon.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>forum.</v>

2741
02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.370
<v Speaker 2>It's very delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2742
02:01:43.371 --> 02:01:46.070
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I drink this shit all the time.</v>

2743
02:01:46.071 --> 02:01:51.071
<v Speaker 2>You know why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it tastes good and it doesn't </v>

2744
02:01:51.071 --> 02:01:54.011
<v Speaker 2>have any bullshit in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is all just zero calories and </v>

2745
02:01:54.011 --> 02:01:54.530
<v Speaker 2>zero sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2746
02:01:54.531 --> 02:01:59.531
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's grape soda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's clear because they don't have </v>

2747
02:01:59.531 --> 02:01:59.531
<v Speaker 2>any per se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

2748
02:01:59.531 --> 02:02:00.410
<v Speaker 2>But look clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looks like fire and water.</v>

2749
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:01.580
<v Speaker 2>It's like the Zima.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2750
02:02:01.870 --> 02:02:03.140
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still loves him.</v>

2751
02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:04.730
<v Speaker 2>It's not as easy add.</v>

2752
02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:06.740
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any fucking nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that company.</v>

2753
02:02:06.741 --> 02:02:08.900
<v Speaker 2>They're not a sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't that the whole world?</v>

2754
02:02:08.901 --> 02:02:10.780
<v Speaker 2>Like facts are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2755
02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:13.700
<v Speaker 2>people will assign their motives to </v>
<v Speaker 2>facts and like everything.</v>

2756
02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could say I work for you.</v>

2757
02:02:15.330 --> 02:02:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could say he's a great cooler.</v>

2758
02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:23.080
<v Speaker 2>It's the best I've ever used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I use them all the time more than any </v>

2759
02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:24.350
<v Speaker 2>normal person because my job and I found</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to be.</v>

2760
02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:29.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm proud to work for the company </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's something I can stand </v>

2761
02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:29.440
<v Speaker 2>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I still have people to be like,</v>

2762
02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:29.510
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever man.</v>

2763
02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.070
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just shilling for your company,</v>

2764
02:02:31.130 --> 02:02:33.080
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's.</v>

2765
02:02:33.320 --> 02:02:35.240
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it smart though that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cynical?</v>

2766
02:02:35.241 --> 02:02:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2767
02:02:35.631 --> 02:02:37.430
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here's a perfect example.</v>

2768
02:02:37.431 --> 02:02:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I rant and rave about the glory of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>1965 corvette.</v>

2769
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't work for 1965 corvettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2770
02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:49.860
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just like there's a reality </v>
<v Speaker 2>about certain things that are awesome </v>

2771
02:02:49.860 --> 02:02:51.620
<v Speaker 2>that people have created that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrate and I don't.</v>

2772
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't say I'm not going to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>z via because they're not a sponsor.</v>

2773
02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:58.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to talk about Yeti because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not a sponsor.</v>

2774
02:02:58.630 --> 02:03:00.710
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all interesting.</v>

2775
02:03:00.711 --> 02:03:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like when people get it right.</v>

2776
02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:08.020
<v Speaker 2>You have this like this podcast where </v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done your closing on a thousand </v>

2777
02:03:08.020 --> 02:03:09.230
<v Speaker 2>episodes and if you remove like all </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumer products from the conversation,</v>

2778
02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:14.260
<v Speaker 2>it would suck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is people boiled down </v>

2779
02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:19.540
<v Speaker 2>innovation to a consumer product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They boil it down to a material </v>

2780
02:03:19.540 --> 02:03:21.230
<v Speaker 2>possession that somebody has to </v>
<v Speaker 2>purchase.</v>

2781
02:03:21.320 --> 02:03:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not looking at it that way.</v>

2782
02:03:23.901 --> 02:03:28.901
<v Speaker 2>I'm being honest when I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I'm looking at something that </v>

2783
02:03:28.901 --> 02:03:28.901
<v Speaker 2>someone had someone create some new </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation,</v>

2784
02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:31.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh look what they did.</v>

2785
02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish.</v>

2786
02:03:33.130 --> 02:03:36.050
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could have figured that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it?</v>

2787
02:03:36.230 --> 02:03:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't even think that because I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 2>an inventor,</v>

2788
02:03:38.151 --> 02:03:38.960
<v Speaker 2>but I do.</v>

2789
02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:42.050
<v Speaker 2>I do get excited about only archery side</v>
<v Speaker 2>of things.</v>

2790
02:03:42.080 --> 02:03:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Bluetooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that really,</v>

2791
02:03:44.850 --> 02:03:46.190
<v Speaker 2>that link I sent you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is real.</v>

2792
02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:48.530
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's it called?</v>

2793
02:03:48.590 --> 02:03:50.990
<v Speaker 2>What's the name of the company?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bread crumb tech.</v>

2794
02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Bluetooth knocks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is I'm shooting 86 pounds,</v>

2795
02:03:57.401 --> 02:04:02.000
<v Speaker 2>so I'm here to have a strong man's </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen.</v>

2796
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:03.680
<v Speaker 2>There's not going to be any knocks </v>
<v Speaker 2>poking out.</v>

2797
02:04:03.681 --> 02:04:06.860
<v Speaker 2>We can track those things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people tell you know through me</v>

2798
02:04:06.861 --> 02:04:11.861
<v Speaker 2>to tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to just dial it down a little bit </v>

2799
02:04:11.861 --> 02:04:11.861
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit.</v>

2800
02:04:11.861 --> 02:04:12.370
<v Speaker 2>For Real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2801
02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:13.590
<v Speaker 2>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a couple people say,</v>

2802
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:17.030
<v Speaker 2>you can't be promoted shooting that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>poundage.</v>

2803
02:04:17.120 --> 02:04:21.260
<v Speaker 2>I just want you motherfuckers check out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show might go this way.</v>

2804
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:26.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand why people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't factor into their mind that </v>

2805
02:04:26.790 --> 02:04:29.240
<v Speaker 2>some people are stronger than them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

2806
02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Like if you pull 60 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel bad.</v>

2807
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:35.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm not upset at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at these things.</v>

2808
02:04:35.571 --> 02:04:40.571
<v Speaker 2>Look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they shoot this Arrow and then with </v>

2809
02:04:40.891 --> 02:04:45.891
<v Speaker 2>your phone you can track the knock </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a bluetooth device that has some</v>

2810
02:04:46.171 --> 02:04:48.540
<v Speaker 2>sort of a gps locator on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2811
02:04:48.541 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 2>you shoot it in the grass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I do often.</v>

2812
02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.470
<v Speaker 2>He missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my best brand.</v>

2813
02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:57.500
<v Speaker 2>Bates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brandon Bates from a or mef rocky </v>

2814
02:04:57.500 --> 02:04:57.500
<v Speaker 2>mountain elk foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good man.</v>

2815
02:04:57.570 --> 02:04:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Let's get into America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Had on America.</v>

2816
02:04:59.950 --> 02:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>I got to America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Case for my phone.</v>

2817
02:05:02.190 --> 02:05:03.060
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

2818
02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:08.900
<v Speaker 2>Nothing better than wait till we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new studio and the America flag in </v>

2819
02:05:08.900 --> 02:05:09.300
<v Speaker 2>the background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The flag we got sitting back there.</v>

2820
02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:11.630
<v Speaker 2>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Damn Gory.</v>

2821
02:05:11.700 --> 02:05:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Have you previewed the new student?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new CEO,</v>

2822
02:05:13.681 --> 02:05:14.710
<v Speaker 2>but he knows anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2823
02:05:14.711 --> 02:05:16.690
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a new studio when it.</v>

2824
02:05:16.740 --> 02:05:18.270
<v Speaker 2>When it comes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will be epic.</v>

2825
02:05:19.150 --> 02:05:21.780
<v Speaker 2>You guys don't worry about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these knocks,</v>

2826
02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:25.110
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a good way to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrows for sure,</v>

2827
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:29.940
<v Speaker 2>but what's what's interesting is it'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>be a good way to track animals.</v>

2828
02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:34.740
<v Speaker 2>If you shoot an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of times people will shoot an</v>

2829
02:05:34.741 --> 02:05:39.390
<v Speaker 2>animal and the animal runs and it's in </v>
<v Speaker 2>thick cover and you can't find it.</v>

2830
02:05:39.690 --> 02:05:41.550
<v Speaker 2>It's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It died quick.</v>

2831
02:05:41.551 --> 02:05:46.551
<v Speaker 2>Like an animal can run 200 yards inside </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a few seconds and die immediately and</v>

2832
02:05:48.181 --> 02:05:50.160
<v Speaker 2>you might never find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you shoot exactly where,</v>

2833
02:05:50.161 --> 02:05:51.720
<v Speaker 2>even though you put a hole on each of </v>
<v Speaker 2>his lungs.</v>

2834
02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:57.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two inch dynamic diameter range </v>

2835
02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:57.200
<v Speaker 2>brought out or one and a quarter or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2836
02:05:57.200 --> 02:05:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can run 100 yards.</v>

2837
02:05:59.370 --> 02:06:01.980
<v Speaker 2>Examples that place we were at a Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

2838
02:06:03.030 --> 02:06:07.380
<v Speaker 2>This place had these scrub oaks that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were six feet tall and you could not get</v>

2839
02:06:07.381 --> 02:06:09.690
<v Speaker 2>into and the animals you would shoot </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

2840
02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:11.850
<v Speaker 2>The guys were talking to us about pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2841
02:06:11.851 --> 02:06:14.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a pig contest and shot three last</v>

2842
02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:16.920
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was wrong with you?</v>

2843
02:06:17.220 --> 02:06:19.290
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't make sense until you go </v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go,</v>

2844
02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:19.840
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2845
02:06:19.841 --> 02:06:23.310
<v Speaker 2>are you going to find that lead there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would we go there?</v>

2846
02:06:23.311 --> 02:06:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Like why would we do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2847
02:06:24.740 --> 02:06:26.950
<v Speaker 2>we just need to trim that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2848
02:06:27.300 --> 02:06:28.920
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should've talked to them about that.</v>

2849
02:06:28.921 --> 02:06:33.921
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they kind of knew where they </v>

2850
02:06:33.921 --> 02:06:33.921
<v Speaker 2>were putting it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just like trees as Christ.</v>

2851
02:06:33.921 --> 02:06:37.080
<v Speaker 2>You have so much Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's any place that you hunt,</v>

2852
02:06:37.081 --> 02:06:40.590
<v Speaker 2>like especially when you think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>recovering game even though will not.</v>

2853
02:06:40.650 --> 02:06:43.140
<v Speaker 2>You think it's fairly flat place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if I shoot a deer,</v>

2854
02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:48.141
<v Speaker 2>I'll see it go down or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes behind a bush or it goes over a </v>

2855
02:06:48.141 --> 02:06:48.480
<v Speaker 2>rise and you go and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh crap.</v>

2856
02:06:48.690 --> 02:06:53.690
<v Speaker 2>Well how about the place that we were at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last day where the grass was six </v>

2857
02:06:53.690 --> 02:06:56.961
<v Speaker 2>feet high and the animals were in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass when they were waiting.</v>

2858
02:06:57.930 --> 02:07:01.590
<v Speaker 2>What's crazy was ben and I were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shot at this one,</v>

2859
02:07:01.591 --> 02:07:04.650
<v Speaker 2>deer and other deer that were like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>feet away from us,</v>

2860
02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:07.620
<v Speaker 2>jumped out of the bushes like they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>hiding.</v>

2861
02:07:07.621 --> 02:07:09.060
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they heard us talking,</v>

2862
02:07:09.061 --> 02:07:11.640
<v Speaker 2>they knew we were there and they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>laid low.</v>

2863
02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:13.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they like,</v>

2864
02:07:13.590 --> 02:07:16.380
<v Speaker 2>they laid low and then you shot an arrow</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they were like,</v>

2865
02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:18.000
<v Speaker 2>I know what that sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2866
02:07:18.001 --> 02:07:23.001
<v Speaker 2>And they ran off and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we knew they didn't cross into the next </v>

2867
02:07:23.001 --> 02:07:23.001
<v Speaker 2>little paddock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the next across this road.</v>

2868
02:07:23.001 --> 02:07:27.981
<v Speaker 2>So I circled around and got up on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>mound so I could see into the grass and </v>

2869
02:07:27.981 --> 02:07:29.370
<v Speaker 2>I could see it in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just like talking to her like,</v>

2870
02:07:29.371 --> 02:07:30.780
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do we do?</v>

2871
02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:35.980
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying</v>

2872
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:37.600
<v Speaker 4>to get you to go in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you were what,</v>

2873
02:07:37.601 --> 02:07:40.120
<v Speaker 4>like six feet away from these things by </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time,</v>

2874
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:42.860
<v Speaker 2>by the time we got to him I was no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no further.</v>

2875
02:07:42.861 --> 02:07:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Within 15 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2876
02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Jargon an to here that has sort of grown</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of his head.</v>

2877
02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:50.300
<v Speaker 2>Multiple pretty crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're just.</v>

2878
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Animals evolved to experience whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>the dangers of their environment are.</v>

2879
02:07:55.310 --> 02:07:57.700
<v Speaker 2>There dangers are 100 percent people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2880
02:07:58.370 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 2>That animals probably four or five years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old had been around people for four or </v>

2881
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:03.370
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2882
02:08:03.370 --> 02:08:04.670
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it when people are around,</v>

2883
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:05.960
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to eat you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2884
02:08:06.140 --> 02:08:07.790
<v Speaker 2>People have never gotten me in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>grass.</v>

2885
02:08:08.800 --> 02:08:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody else has ever been able to do it.</v>

2886
02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:16.240
<v Speaker 2>So how did you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did the Nepal thing and you get it </v>

2887
02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:16.240
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

2888
02:08:16.490 --> 02:08:18.740
<v Speaker 4>get it together?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we left off at.</v>

2889
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:22.820
<v Speaker 4>I started to get sick while the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>next day I was puking shit and,</v>

2890
02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:25.850
<v Speaker 4>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had the flu.</v>

2891
02:08:25.851 --> 02:08:27.920
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else got.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I just got it like two days later.</v>

2892
02:08:28.970 --> 02:08:33.970
<v Speaker 4>And so it was that day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first day we'd seen sheep,</v>

2893
02:08:34.551 --> 02:08:39.551
<v Speaker 4>so we were three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think four days into the end of the </v>

2894
02:08:39.551 --> 02:08:41.771
<v Speaker 4>track and we were camping somewhere at </v>
<v Speaker 4>14,000</v>

2895
02:08:41.901 --> 02:08:43.470
<v Speaker 4>feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>

2896
02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:46.430
<v Speaker 4>the next day the guy was with another </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy that had a tag.</v>

2897
02:08:46.431 --> 02:08:49.720
<v Speaker 4>Coal goes up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shoots a sheep and like six,</v>

2898
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:53.390
<v Speaker 4>like they climb up to thousand feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>60 mile an hour,</v>

2899
02:08:53.391 --> 02:08:55.310
<v Speaker 4>wind bursts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>microbursts,</v>

2900
02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:58.940
<v Speaker 4>frostbite conditions like these guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>when they came back,</v>

2901
02:08:58.941 --> 02:09:02.330
<v Speaker 4>looked beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And these are cold Kramer,</v>

2902
02:09:02.331 --> 02:09:05.660
<v Speaker 4>who we went with is a Kodiak Alaska bear</v>
<v Speaker 4>guide and a mountain hunter.</v>

2903
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:08.400
<v Speaker 4>And His hardcores gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2904
02:09:08.401 --> 02:09:13.401
<v Speaker 4>I looked at his face when he got back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I had just been in my 10 old day </v>

2905
02:09:13.401 --> 02:09:15.100
<v Speaker 4>puking and trying to stay alive and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at his face and he's like,</v>

2906
02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:15.830
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

2907
02:09:16.150 --> 02:09:18.740
<v Speaker 4>And I thought I can't make it over there</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the latrine,</v>

2908
02:09:19.190 --> 02:09:21.770
<v Speaker 4>let alone up this mountain to kill a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sheep.</v>

2909
02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:27.300
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so I kinda had resigned myself to </v>

2910
02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:27.300
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is it,</v>

2911
02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:27.300
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't,</v>

2912
02:09:27.300 --> 02:09:29.090
<v Speaker 4>I wish I was healthy enough to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's,</v>

2913
02:09:29.091 --> 02:09:34.091
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get up there and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>have issues and not be able to get </v>

2914
02:09:34.091 --> 02:09:36.630
<v Speaker 4>helicopter rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we,</v>

2915
02:09:36.770 --> 02:09:41.770
<v Speaker 4>we talked about it but the worst part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'll just have to tell us just </v>

2916
02:09:41.770 --> 02:09:45.170
<v Speaker 4>because it's like the low point of my </v>
<v Speaker 4>trip there.</v>

2917
02:09:46.250 --> 02:09:48.560
<v Speaker 4>The third night in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we got to camp,</v>

2918
02:09:49.670 --> 02:09:52.580
<v Speaker 4>I was puking in the vestibule of my tent</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all the,</v>

2919
02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:55.700
<v Speaker 4>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Nepali guys or are you okay?</v>

2920
02:09:55.701 --> 02:09:56.780
<v Speaker 4>You okay?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2921
02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:58.850
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not okay.</v>

2922
02:09:58.910 --> 02:10:02.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm puking and then fell asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Woke back up.</v>

2923
02:10:02.100 --> 02:10:04.640
<v Speaker 4>I had to go to the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the medic is there.</v>

2924
02:10:04.641 --> 02:10:06.380
<v Speaker 4>He's helping me to the bathroom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I can't,</v>

2925
02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:07.820
<v Speaker 4>I'm not gonna make it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't stand up,</v>

2926
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:13.330
<v Speaker 4>so I literally just Kinda like huddled </v>
<v Speaker 4>over in the snow and pull my pants down </v>

2927
02:10:13.330 --> 02:10:15.770
<v Speaker 4>and just write it in the middle of camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just let it go</v>

2928
02:10:19.040 --> 02:10:19.460
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

2929
02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:21.970
<v Speaker 4>I just remember do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like just thinking,</v>

2930
02:10:22.510 --> 02:10:27.510
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I look up and there's all these </v>

2931
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.510
<v Speaker 4>porters,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sherpas with their headlamps on.</v>

2932
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's that bad.</v>

2933
02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:29.320
<v Speaker 2>You okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2934
02:10:29.810 --> 02:10:32.570
<v Speaker 2>look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dying.</v>

2935
02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:33.940
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

2936
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:38.980
<v Speaker 4>so that was the lowest point of the trip</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that I think the next day cold </v>

2937
02:10:40.641 --> 02:10:45.641
<v Speaker 4>killed a sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The day after that I went up the </v>

2938
02:10:45.641 --> 02:10:47.360
<v Speaker 4>mountain with a both in mid day just for</v>
<v Speaker 4>another,</v>

2939
02:10:47.361 --> 02:10:48.830
<v Speaker 4>like acclimation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could I make it?</v>

2940
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:52.190
<v Speaker 4>We got into a group of sheep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't make it happen,</v>

2941
02:10:52.191 --> 02:10:55.070
<v Speaker 4>but I went up the mountain basically </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably 1200 feet,</v>

2942
02:10:55.071 --> 02:10:57.650
<v Speaker 4>just a good climb.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Went back down there like,</v>

2943
02:10:57.651 --> 02:11:02.651
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tomorrow is kind of the last chance </v>

2944
02:11:02.651 --> 02:11:02.651
<v Speaker 4>because we're almost out of areas to </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunt these sheep.</v>

2945
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:06.860
<v Speaker 4>And we went up the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say like eight miles.</v>

2946
02:11:06.890 --> 02:11:08.180
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it written down somewhere,</v>

2947
02:11:08.230 --> 02:11:13.230
<v Speaker 4>88 miles and being on death's door to </v>
<v Speaker 4>his store and I wasn't to be the 100 </v>

2948
02:11:14.331 --> 02:11:16.490
<v Speaker 4>percent on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't carrying a pack or anything.</v>

2949
02:11:16.491 --> 02:11:20.300
<v Speaker 4>I just had trekking poles and a bio </v>
<v Speaker 4>harness and I was just like one foot,</v>

2950
02:11:20.301 --> 02:11:25.301
<v Speaker 4>one foot and we got into these mountain </v>
<v Speaker 4>passes in these valleys where there was </v>

2951
02:11:25.301 --> 02:11:28.661
<v Speaker 4>like two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three feet of snow and it was frozen on </v>

2952
02:11:28.661 --> 02:11:29.930
<v Speaker 4>the top and you were just like every </v>
<v Speaker 4>step you would crunch two feet down,</v>

2953
02:11:29.931 --> 02:11:31.490
<v Speaker 4>like boom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>boom.</v>

2954
02:11:31.670 --> 02:11:36.140
<v Speaker 4>And it was an hour of that and there was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a time during that where we,</v>

2955
02:11:36.740 --> 02:11:41.740
<v Speaker 4>we summited this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the probably the highest peak we were </v>

2956
02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:41.740
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is mid 15,</v>

2957
02:11:41.740 --> 02:11:44.200
<v Speaker 4>close to 16 and I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't this.</v>

2958
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:48.500
<v Speaker 4>I hope the sheep are right there because</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is it like this as far as I can go.</v>

2959
02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:54.550
<v Speaker 4>And we rested and we glassy sheep and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there they are like a mile and a half </v>

2960
02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:58.450
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Found this other giant ravine and up on </v>

2961
02:11:58.450 --> 02:12:02.411
<v Speaker 4>this other flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember even the guys who were </v>

2962
02:12:02.411 --> 02:12:05.051
<v Speaker 4>with looking at like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not gonna be able to go over there </v>

2963
02:12:05.051 --> 02:12:05.150
<v Speaker 4>and I just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just remember thinking like,</v>

2964
02:12:05.151 --> 02:12:07.460
<v Speaker 4>this is what I'm doing it like I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to go.</v>

2965
02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:11.030
<v Speaker 4>And we slid on our butts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like down the side of this mountain.</v>

2966
02:12:11.031 --> 02:12:14.270
<v Speaker 4>Me and two guides slid on our butts down</v>
<v Speaker 4>the side of the snowy.</v>

2967
02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:16.400
<v Speaker 4>Icy Bank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Up,</v>

2968
02:12:16.730 --> 02:12:19.700
<v Speaker 4>walked a half a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>popped up over this ridge there.</v>

2969
02:12:19.701 --> 02:12:22.940
<v Speaker 4>The sheep are within 300 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In about 20 minutes.</v>

2970
02:12:22.941 --> 02:12:24.530
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got on a big Ram and shot him.</v>

2971
02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:26.500
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2972
02:12:27.450 --> 02:12:29.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there was no celebration.</v>

2973
02:12:29.540 --> 02:12:31.970
<v Speaker 4>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wasn't even happy,</v>

2974
02:12:31.971 --> 02:12:33.230
<v Speaker 4>I don't think because you're so out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2975
02:12:33.231 --> 02:12:38.231
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I just kinda like slumped over </v>

2976
02:12:38.231 --> 02:12:39.821
<v Speaker 4>on my pack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was laying prone is like slumped over </v>

2977
02:12:39.821 --> 02:12:39.821
<v Speaker 4>my pack and like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2978
02:12:40.070 --> 02:12:41.790
<v Speaker 4>Did you eat it that night?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2979
02:12:41.850 --> 02:12:44.930
<v Speaker 4>they ate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing was not all that night.</v>

2980
02:12:44.931 --> 02:12:46.360
<v Speaker 4>But Julian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2981
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:49.420
<v Speaker 4>I was too sick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the spices that curry spices,</v>

2982
02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:52.630
<v Speaker 4>even the smell of that curry spice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't even take like eight.</v>

2983
02:12:52.970 --> 02:12:57.970
<v Speaker 4>A good bit of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But they carried up your shit on </v>

2984
02:12:57.970 --> 02:12:57.970
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But even the tent smelled like that.</v>

2985
02:12:57.970 --> 02:12:59.030
<v Speaker 4>So I like the cook tent.</v>

2986
02:12:59.030 --> 02:13:00.650
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't even really be in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

2987
02:13:00.730 --> 02:13:02.630
<v Speaker 4>I end up just eating rice for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>

2988
02:13:02.680 --> 02:13:07.680
<v Speaker 4>I just couldn't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't stomach because it just such a </v>

2989
02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:09.230
<v Speaker 4>gnarly experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So everybody ate your sheep,</v>

2990
02:13:09.590 --> 02:13:11.330
<v Speaker 4>like you didn't even bring it back?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2991
02:13:11.331 --> 02:13:12.890
<v Speaker 4>you can't bring the meat back here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyways.</v>

2992
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:14.870
<v Speaker 4>So the point was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they had,</v>

2993
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:18.920
<v Speaker 4>they had mostly already eaten cold sheep</v>
<v Speaker 4>within a day and a half or two days.</v>

2994
02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:21.320
<v Speaker 4>And I'm talking 20 people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Twenty four,</v>

2995
02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:22.690
<v Speaker 4>25 of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Wow.</v>

2996
02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

2997
02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:27.020
<v Speaker 4>That burden and through the burning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And not only did they eat the eyeballs,</v>

2998
02:13:27.250 --> 02:13:30.340
<v Speaker 4>we so call a shot a sheep and he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping out the head,</v>

2999
02:13:30.370 --> 02:13:33.090
<v Speaker 4>take the off head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pop the eyeballs out.</v>

3000
02:13:33.091 --> 02:13:36.300
<v Speaker 4>And I think jokingly handed to one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the porters like,</v>

3001
02:13:36.690 --> 02:13:37.650
<v Speaker 4>ha,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat this.</v>

3002
02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:43.040
<v Speaker 4>And I haven't watched that dude put it </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the stick and put it over a fire and </v>

3003
02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:43.040
<v Speaker 4>eat it.</v>

3004
02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:43.520
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I wouldn't.</v>

3005
02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they didn't see this personally,</v>

3006
02:13:46.201 --> 02:13:47.880
<v Speaker 4>but they were picky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3007
02:13:47.881 --> 02:13:51.780
<v Speaker 4>They took the punch to the gut sack and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cut it open,</v>

3008
02:13:51.781 --> 02:13:56.460
<v Speaker 4>flat out the insights and took it back </v>
<v Speaker 4>and cook that too.</v>

3009
02:13:56.461 --> 02:14:01.461
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Kinda like a Pegasus try kind of </v>

3010
02:14:01.461 --> 02:14:03.240
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I mean they just like,</v>

3011
02:14:04.230 --> 02:14:06.510
<v Speaker 4>they just devoured the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you go back?</v>

3012
02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:10.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3013
02:14:10.490 --> 02:14:12.030
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to northwest territories.</v>

3014
02:14:12.031 --> 02:14:15.070
<v Speaker 4>That's going to suck a then we'll be bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

3015
02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:15.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm saying.</v>

3016
02:14:15.910 --> 02:14:20.910
<v Speaker 4>I think about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I often think about like what if I'm </v>

3017
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:21.000
<v Speaker 4>glad it happened the way it did because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I get,</v>

3018
02:14:21.140 --> 02:14:26.140
<v Speaker 4>I got so much perspective on the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>back because we still had two days to </v>

3019
02:14:26.140 --> 02:14:26.670
<v Speaker 4>hike out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get back to Tia,</v>

3020
02:14:26.671 --> 02:14:29.700
<v Speaker 4>picked up to go to go back to Katmandu.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was two and a half,</v>

3021
02:14:29.701 --> 02:14:32.310
<v Speaker 4>three days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hike out and hike out.</v>

3022
02:14:32.310 --> 02:14:35.370
<v Speaker 4>The first day we were hiking out after I</v>
<v Speaker 4>shot my sheep and I had a night's rest.</v>

3023
02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:38.310
<v Speaker 4>And I remember getting back in like </v>
<v Speaker 4>midnight,</v>

3024
02:14:38.311 --> 02:14:38.700
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

3025
02:14:38.730 --> 02:14:43.730
<v Speaker 4>we got back at like 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 4>PM had left at six in the morning from </v>

3026
02:14:43.730 --> 02:14:44.850
<v Speaker 4>killing my sheet and I was just so like </v>
<v Speaker 4>emotionally,</v>

3027
02:14:44.851 --> 02:14:49.851
<v Speaker 4>spiritually just fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking well tomorrow </v>

3028
02:14:49.851 --> 02:14:52.080
<v Speaker 4>they're going to give us a rest day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the guide was like,</v>

3029
02:14:52.081 --> 02:14:53.250
<v Speaker 4>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3030
02:14:53.300 --> 02:14:55.290
<v Speaker 4>like it's too hot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's too late.</v>

3031
02:14:55.530 --> 02:15:00.530
<v Speaker 4>We're all getting sunburn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I had like blisters on the roof of </v>

3032
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.530
<v Speaker 4>my mouth from the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My whole.</v>

3033
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:01.650
<v Speaker 4>My whole roof of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3034
02:15:01.651 --> 02:15:06.030
<v Speaker 4>From like going up and the sun bouncing </v>
<v Speaker 4>off the snow.</v>

3035
02:15:06.220 --> 02:15:08.470
<v Speaker 4>Hit your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's blisters?</v>

3036
02:15:09.230 --> 02:15:11.670
<v Speaker 4>Sunburn on the roof of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did.</v>

3037
02:15:12.090 --> 02:15:14.400
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even heard of that before.</v>

3038
02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:17.080
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's a pretty common thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>for guys that go that elevations,</v>

3039
02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:17.820
<v Speaker 4>hikers and stuff.</v>

3040
02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:19.470
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might not be.</v>

3041
02:15:19.471 --> 02:15:23.370
<v Speaker 4>So do you have like sunscreen on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>lips and your face and I'll you through.</v>

3042
02:15:23.371 --> 02:15:28.371
<v Speaker 4>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like I didn't really think about </v>

3043
02:15:28.371 --> 02:15:29.220
<v Speaker 4>that because I was hot but I wasn't the </v>
<v Speaker 4>field burning up.</v>

3044
02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:31.350
<v Speaker 4>But like there's photos I look at now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm like,</v>

3045
02:15:31.410 --> 02:15:35.070
<v Speaker 4>my lips are cracking open and bleed and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I got like it was.</v>

3046
02:15:35.130 --> 02:15:40.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you watch shockey's episode when </v>

3047
02:15:40.130 --> 02:15:42.651
<v Speaker 4>he was in Nepal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's similar like they're self filming </v>

3048
02:15:42.651 --> 02:15:45.231
<v Speaker 4>and it's like this pretty visceral.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They get something out of that though </v>

3049
02:15:45.231 --> 02:15:49.110
<v Speaker 4>other than the survival.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much out of that I got like,</v>

3050
02:15:49.321 --> 02:15:50.940
<v Speaker 4>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've written this now,</v>

3051
02:15:50.941 --> 02:15:54.570
<v Speaker 4>I probably wrote like 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>words on the trip,</v>

3052
02:15:54.571 --> 02:15:59.220
<v Speaker 4>but I got this like amazing feeling </v>
<v Speaker 4>first being around people that are,</v>

3053
02:15:59.221 --> 02:16:01.170
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not primitives the wrong word,</v>

3054
02:16:01.171 --> 02:16:05.790
<v Speaker 4>but that removed from society.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have,</v>

3055
02:16:06.150 --> 02:16:08.580
<v Speaker 4>they don't really even have the option </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be modern.</v>

3056
02:16:08.970 --> 02:16:11.040
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they couldn't get it.</v>

3057
02:16:11.550 --> 02:16:13.470
<v Speaker 4>They couldn't get a chainsaw if they </v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to.</v>

3058
02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:18.500
<v Speaker 4>Like they have an ax and they need to </v>
<v Speaker 4>chop wood and like just being around </v>

3059
02:16:18.500 --> 02:16:23.301
<v Speaker 4>that level of just primitive people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're primitive.</v>

3060
02:16:25.220 --> 02:16:30.220
<v Speaker 4>The wrong word,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll think of something better than </v>

3061
02:16:30.220 --> 02:16:31.210
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But their spirit was so infectious.</v>

3062
02:16:31.211 --> 02:16:34.000
<v Speaker 4>Like they're happy people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you have these Sherpas,</v>

3063
02:16:34.001 --> 02:16:35.680
<v Speaker 4>importers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who,</v>

3064
02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:37.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those big sick bags,</v>

3065
02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:42.600
<v Speaker 4>the big roller top bags.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We took one to base camp because they </v>

3066
02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:42.910
<v Speaker 4>told us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh we can leave it,</v>

3067
02:16:42.911 --> 02:16:47.911
<v Speaker 4>we won't take it in the hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These guys would take like a 90 pound </v>

3068
02:16:47.911 --> 02:16:48.050
<v Speaker 4>suitcase,</v>
<v Speaker 4>put it on top of their head.</v>

3069
02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:51.610
<v Speaker 4>Just go walking up these trails I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>describing like it was nothing to put on</v>

3070
02:16:51.611 --> 02:16:52.330
<v Speaker 4>their head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3071
02:16:52.331 --> 02:16:57.331
<v Speaker 4>They balanced everything in a basket on </v>
<v Speaker 4>her head and all these porters a 90 </v>

3072
02:16:57.331 --> 02:16:57.331
<v Speaker 4>pound bag.</v>

3073
02:16:57.331 --> 02:16:57.850
<v Speaker 4>And they would do more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two hundred pounds.</v>

3074
02:16:58.450 --> 02:16:59.280
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3075
02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:03.130
<v Speaker 4>Head strap basket back here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two hundred pounds.</v>

3076
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:04.510
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If not more than that.</v>

3077
02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:06.290
<v Speaker 4>What kind of disc issues?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those guys,</v>

3078
02:17:06.590 --> 02:17:07.380
<v Speaker 4>they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3079
02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:12.640
<v Speaker 4>and they're wearing like these guys are </v>
<v Speaker 4>wearing like sandals and some of them </v>

3080
02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:17.341
<v Speaker 4>were born in like old sneakers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're just wearing whatever clothes </v>

3081
02:17:17.341 --> 02:17:21.181
<v Speaker 4>that they would able to gather and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing these amazing things and </v>

3082
02:17:21.671 --> 02:17:26.671
<v Speaker 4>when they take a break from something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you or I could never conceive of </v>

3083
02:17:26.671 --> 02:17:27.870
<v Speaker 4>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like happy as could be there.</v>

3084
02:17:28.470 --> 02:17:31.450
<v Speaker 4>Their perspective on life is only </v>
<v Speaker 4>hardship.</v>

3085
02:17:31.451 --> 02:17:33.130
<v Speaker 4>And poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all they know,</v>

3086
02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:35.530
<v Speaker 4>but that's the only thing they'll ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

3087
02:17:36.010 --> 02:17:38.800
<v Speaker 4>but yet they're happier than,</v>
<v Speaker 4>than I think maybe I could ever be.</v>

3088
02:17:39.670 --> 02:17:42.900
<v Speaker 4>Does a big part of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3089
02:17:42.940 --> 02:17:47.940
<v Speaker 4>Sebastian younger's book tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A big part of it is like how living easy</v>

3090
02:17:48.970 --> 02:17:53.970
<v Speaker 4>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not sustaining massive amounts of </v>

3091
02:17:53.970 --> 02:17:57.271
<v Speaker 4>difficulty like most people do in these </v>
<v Speaker 4>impoverished communities is one of the </v>

3092
02:17:57.271 --> 02:17:59.710
<v Speaker 4>reasons why people aren't happy is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people actually need struggle,</v>

3093
02:17:59.711 --> 02:18:01.930
<v Speaker 4>which is very counterintuitive for </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3094
02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:03.550
<v Speaker 4>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I remember coming back,</v>

3095
02:18:03.551 --> 02:18:06.120
<v Speaker 4>there was a bunch of moments that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could describe all these moments where I</v>

3096
02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:10.130
<v Speaker 4>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd be at my wit's end just thinking I'm</v>

3097
02:18:10.140 --> 02:18:12.370
<v Speaker 4>just a regular Dominican,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like some adventure.</v>

3098
02:18:12.371 --> 02:18:17.371
<v Speaker 4>What am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'd get to a point where obviously </v>

3099
02:18:17.371 --> 02:18:19.870
<v Speaker 4>pleased and I would look over and here </v>
<v Speaker 4>become this porter,</v>

3100
02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:24.970
<v Speaker 4>this 25 year old kid with a basket </v>
<v Speaker 4>strapped on his head with,</v>

3101
02:18:25.510 --> 02:18:28.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 pounds of stuff wearing sneakers.</v>

3102
02:18:28.661 --> 02:18:31.540
<v Speaker 4>And I got $400 Italian boots on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sixth gear.</v>

3103
02:18:31.541 --> 02:18:36.541
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it would always come with these </v>

3104
02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:36.541
<v Speaker 4>opportune moments where I'd look over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'd see that and pick,</v>

3105
02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:39.040
<v Speaker 4>oh crap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this person is here I am.</v>

3106
02:18:39.041 --> 02:18:44.041
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am in physical pain and things are </v>

3107
02:18:44.041 --> 02:18:45.901
<v Speaker 4>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like to have the mental fortitude </v>

3108
02:18:45.901 --> 02:18:46.150
<v Speaker 4>that those people have and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>know they have it.</v>

3109
02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:50.540
<v Speaker 4>That's just how they're wired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so I came back after the whole thing</v>

3110
02:18:50.541 --> 02:18:52.540
<v Speaker 4>and I remember hiking out being like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the front of the group,</v>

3111
02:18:52.541 --> 02:18:53.920
<v Speaker 4>all of a sudden like really feeling </v>
<v Speaker 4>good.</v>

3112
02:18:53.921 --> 02:18:56.860
<v Speaker 4>My packs back on my back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like energized again,</v>

3113
02:18:56.861 --> 02:18:59.140
<v Speaker 4>thinking like this best feeling in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

3114
02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:01.870
<v Speaker 4>that feeling of overcoming that thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and being on the downhill slope.</v>

3115
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:06.070
<v Speaker 4>I'd get back just for that feeling if I </v>
<v Speaker 4>could catch it again.</v>

3116
02:19:06.670 --> 02:19:11.670
<v Speaker 4>I think a big part of the thing of that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is just you don't really appreciate what</v>

3117
02:19:11.681 --> 02:19:13.960
<v Speaker 4>it feels like to be healthy until you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>not healthy.</v>

3118
02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't advise anybody to get food sick,</v>

3119
02:19:16.630 --> 02:19:20.340
<v Speaker 4>food sickness or food poisoning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But one of the things about it as man,</v>

3120
02:19:20.350 --> 02:19:22.540
<v Speaker 4>once it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize you go,</v>

3121
02:19:22.600 --> 02:19:26.170
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like being healthy is so critical.</v>

3122
02:19:26.290 --> 02:19:28.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter</v>

3123
02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:30.230
<v Speaker 5>your status,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your money,</v>

3124
02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:31.690
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your friends did that.</v>

3125
02:19:31.700 --> 02:19:33.920
<v Speaker 5>None of that means shit if you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>unhealthy.</v>

3126
02:19:34.010 --> 02:19:34.810
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3127
02:19:34.811 --> 02:19:36.770
<v Speaker 4>and it's the people in Nepal live in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>

3128
02:19:37.290 --> 02:19:40.940
<v Speaker 4>They just went through a civil war in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the recent decades and these people were</v>

3129
02:19:40.941 --> 02:19:44.200
<v Speaker 4>like at the epicenter of it and there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3130
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:48.530
<v Speaker 4>our trip gave them jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gave them purpose,</v>

3131
02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:53.560
<v Speaker 4>gave like there's a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Our main guide mon door didn't have </v>

3132
02:19:53.571 --> 02:19:58.571
<v Speaker 4>shoes until he was 13 and they used to </v>
<v Speaker 4>go hunting and they would build their </v>

3133
02:19:58.571 --> 02:20:01.190
<v Speaker 4>own guns and he described to us about a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of times where like,</v>

3134
02:20:01.250 --> 02:20:06.250
<v Speaker 4>he had never hiking and hunting sheep </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the gun would blow up on his back </v>

3135
02:20:06.250 --> 02:20:07.130
<v Speaker 4>and blow a shirt off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stuff like that.</v>

3136
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:09.260
<v Speaker 4>They were like making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

3137
02:20:09.630 --> 02:20:13.430
<v Speaker 4>muzzle loaders and using matchsticks as,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a powder.</v>

3138
02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:18.520
<v Speaker 4>I feel like wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there was all these stories like </v>

3139
02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:18.610
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that um,</v>

3140
02:20:19.310 --> 02:20:22.760
<v Speaker 4>perspective perspective and like you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't let people say,</v>

3141
02:20:22.761 --> 02:20:24.800
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your trophy hunted that sheet maybe.</v>

3142
02:20:25.820 --> 02:20:30.150
<v Speaker 4>But there was so much more to it that if</v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody would ever want to see that just</v>

3143
02:20:30.160 --> 02:20:31.550
<v Speaker 4>ate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We ate it.</v>

3144
02:20:31.690 --> 02:20:32.260
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

3145
02:20:32.261 --> 02:20:37.261
<v Speaker 5>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What it means is people make a </v>

3146
02:20:37.261 --> 02:20:40.321
<v Speaker 5>distinction that you did not have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>bring that animal back in order for you </v>

3147
02:20:40.321 --> 02:20:40.321
<v Speaker 5>to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's right.</v>

3148
02:20:40.321 --> 02:20:41.080
<v Speaker 5>So that's the only way</v>

3149
02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:42.870
<v Speaker 4>motive to me then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

3150
02:20:42.871 --> 02:20:44.280
<v Speaker 4>If they call me a trophy and I would say</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3151
02:20:44.281 --> 02:20:47.190
<v Speaker 4>I would say look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you go into a war torn area of the world</v>

3152
02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:52.790
<v Speaker 4>where after the war they don't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of chance to make money.</v>

3153
02:20:53.350 --> 02:20:57.450
<v Speaker 4>Like the tourism is kind of died once </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've been through or it's really not a</v>

3154
02:20:57.451 --> 02:21:02.451
<v Speaker 4>happy place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And plus the place we were hunting and </v>

3155
02:21:02.451 --> 02:21:02.451
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the,</v>

3156
02:21:02.451 --> 02:21:06.980
<v Speaker 4>I think that the rope,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a 10 hunting reserve is like the only </v>

3157
02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:06.980
<v Speaker 4>hunting reserve in Nepal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3158
02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:10.830
<v Speaker 4>and it's heavily regulated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's 19 blue sheep tags a year.</v>

3159
02:21:11.460 --> 02:21:13.350
<v Speaker 4>So you're thinking like everybody that </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes,</v>

3160
02:21:13.351 --> 02:21:15.330
<v Speaker 4>how many people a year go to Mount </v>
<v Speaker 4>Everest base camp?</v>

3161
02:21:15.450 --> 02:21:17.490
<v Speaker 4>Thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what the number is,</v>

3162
02:21:17.491 --> 02:21:19.890
<v Speaker 4>but it's thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's,</v>

3163
02:21:20.160 --> 02:21:25.160
<v Speaker 4>we were probably within a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 4>dozen westerners that had been to that </v>

3164
02:21:25.160 --> 02:21:29.511
<v Speaker 4>area postwar and had brought 24,</v>
<v Speaker 4>25 jobs plus the people that prep that </v>

3165
02:21:29.941 --> 02:21:34.140
<v Speaker 4>plus all that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like seeing that it's pretty powerful</v>

3166
02:21:34.141 --> 02:21:38.850
<v Speaker 4>to me and shooting that sheep and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>even given a shit whether the horns made</v>

3167
02:21:38.851 --> 02:21:41.720
<v Speaker 4>it back or not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you,</v>

3168
02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:43.410
<v Speaker 4>somebody questioned my motive all they </v>
<v Speaker 4>want,</v>

3169
02:21:44.190 --> 02:21:49.190
<v Speaker 4>but within the system and the structure </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's set up there now hunting is one </v>

3170
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:52.080
<v Speaker 4>of the more valuable things that they.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the more valuable tools they have</v>

3171
02:21:52.450 --> 02:21:57.450
<v Speaker 4>to get better at everything that their </v>
<v Speaker 4>lives that they're having.</v>

3172
02:21:59.610 --> 02:22:01.080
<v Speaker 4>It's their resource,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the resource.</v>

3173
02:22:01.210 --> 02:22:01.790
<v Speaker 5>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3174
02:22:01.791 --> 02:22:03.800
<v Speaker 5>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can look down upon that,</v>

3175
02:22:04.040 --> 02:22:09.040
<v Speaker 5>but it is a natural resource and along </v>
<v Speaker 5>the same veins is like if you live in an</v>

3176
02:22:09.651 --> 02:22:12.080
<v Speaker 5>area that has fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a natural resource.</v>

3177
02:22:12.081 --> 02:22:14.030
<v Speaker 5>If you live in an area that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3178
02:22:14.270 --> 02:22:17.630
<v Speaker 5>they dig minerals out of the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a natural resource.</v>

3179
02:22:17.631 --> 02:22:22.631
<v Speaker 5>It's not a good or a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just the reality of their </v>

3180
02:22:22.631 --> 02:22:22.631
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>

3181
02:22:22.631 --> 02:22:26.590
<v Speaker 4>And so there's so many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there is arguments against </v>

3182
02:22:26.590 --> 02:22:26.590
<v Speaker 4>what we did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If somebody broke it down,</v>

3183
02:22:26.590 --> 02:22:27.990
<v Speaker 4>like I always try to break it down for </v>
<v Speaker 4>me in the side,</v>

3184
02:22:27.991 --> 02:22:29.730
<v Speaker 4>I think we will say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why don't you just take pictures of it?</v>

3185
02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:31.620
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

3186
02:22:31.770 --> 02:22:36.770
<v Speaker 4>You just go up there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay 20 grand or whatever you pay for </v>

3187
02:22:36.770 --> 02:22:36.770
<v Speaker 4>hunt like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take some pictures.</v>

3188
02:22:36.770 --> 02:22:41.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>partly the challenge people don't </v>

3189
02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:42.260
<v Speaker 2>understand how difficult it is to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you did like to do what you did and</v>

3190
02:22:42.261 --> 02:22:47.261
<v Speaker 2>then have this final accomplishment </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the get close enough to an </v>

3191
02:22:47.261 --> 02:22:50.501
<v Speaker 2>animal where either it doesn't know </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there or you get an a good place </v>

3192
02:22:50.501 --> 02:22:54.731
<v Speaker 2>where it can't win to you who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>smell you and you can take it out and </v>

3193
02:22:54.731 --> 02:22:56.600
<v Speaker 2>kill it like it's hard to do so insanely</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard to do.</v>

3194
02:22:56.660 --> 02:22:57.890
<v Speaker 2>I've got all my own personal reasons</v>

3195
02:22:58.030 --> 02:23:03.030
<v Speaker 4>wanting to kill that sheep and I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>also say like present a better plan.</v>

3196
02:23:03.091 --> 02:23:08.091
<v Speaker 4>Then are you going to pay what hunters </v>
<v Speaker 4>are willing to pay and already are you </v>

3197
02:23:08.091 --> 02:23:09.330
<v Speaker 4>going to be a part of conservation </v>
<v Speaker 4>regulation?</v>

3198
02:23:09.331 --> 02:23:14.331
<v Speaker 4>The way that hunters are as a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a trekker and a photographer like </v>

3199
02:23:14.331 --> 02:23:14.331
<v Speaker 4>give me</v>

3200
02:23:14.331 --> 02:23:15.430
<v Speaker 2>better idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3201
02:23:15.431 --> 02:23:16.910
<v Speaker 2>but here's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their,</v>

3202
02:23:16.930 --> 02:23:19.540
<v Speaker 2>their response to that could easily be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3203
02:23:19.541 --> 02:23:22.450
<v Speaker 2>what about if you decided to hunt </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

3204
02:23:22.451 --> 02:23:25.800
<v Speaker 2>if you paid a million dollars to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred person and that,</v>

3205
02:23:25.890 --> 02:23:28.900
<v Speaker 2>that money fed all these tribes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in Mozambique,</v>

3206
02:23:28.901 --> 02:23:32.230
<v Speaker 2>is it okay to go out and hunt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People know there's surely still have an</v>

3207
02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:37.090
<v Speaker 2>ethical and moral obligation to them to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to animal rights activists.</v>

3208
02:23:37.091 --> 02:23:39.760
<v Speaker 2>Do you have an ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moral obligation to let that sheep live?</v>

3209
02:23:39.850 --> 02:23:41.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm on your side,</v>

3210
02:23:41.441 --> 02:23:43.870
<v Speaker 2>but I'm just saying on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

3211
02:23:43.871 --> 02:23:44.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do</v>

3212
02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:49.750
<v Speaker 4>do like because we only ate it there </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we didn't have a freezer full of</v>

3213
02:23:50.101 --> 02:23:55.101
<v Speaker 4>backstraps and because that thing didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>occur the way it normally occurs for me </v>

3214
02:23:55.101 --> 02:23:56.650
<v Speaker 4>there was some complexity and have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3215
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:58.530
<v Speaker 4>In my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crap man,</v>

3216
02:23:58.531 --> 02:24:03.531
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>am I really ever here just to collect </v>

3217
02:24:03.531 --> 02:24:03.531
<v Speaker 4>the sheep and bring it home and show </v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3218
02:24:03.531 --> 02:24:03.900
<v Speaker 4>But you also filming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3219
02:24:03.960 --> 02:24:04.510
<v Speaker 4>We made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3220
02:24:04.590 --> 02:24:09.590
<v Speaker 4>we made what will be hopefully an </v>
<v Speaker 4>awesome film and so at the end of the </v>

3221
02:24:09.590 --> 02:24:13.320
<v Speaker 4>day I checked myself and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you do it for the right reasons?</v>

3222
02:24:13.321 --> 02:24:15.150
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and after I looked back the trip,</v>

3223
02:24:15.151 --> 02:24:15.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

3224
02:24:15.631 --> 02:24:18.700
<v Speaker 4>there are 100 reasons why I did it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all good and,</v>

3225
02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:22.440
<v Speaker 4>and it was what we did was a good impact</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the place he went on,</v>

3226
02:24:22.441 --> 02:24:24.630
<v Speaker 4>the animals that we hunted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's,</v>

3227
02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:26.520
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to me it's all good and I,</v>

3228
02:24:26.521 --> 02:24:31.521
<v Speaker 4>and I would love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have argued with somebody that feels </v>

3229
02:24:31.521 --> 02:24:31.521
<v Speaker 4>differently about that.</v>

3230
02:24:31.521 --> 02:24:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Plus you got the trip balls and see a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fake baby and a fake wolf.</v>

3231
02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:36.750
<v Speaker 2>People pay a lot of money for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man,</v>

3232
02:24:36.751 --> 02:24:39.720
<v Speaker 2>you get mushrooms are expensive and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might not see a wolf.</v>

3233
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 2>You might not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not see a baby on the road.</v>

3234
02:24:42.210 --> 02:24:47.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's still like a log sheet </v>
<v Speaker 2>or like a wolf shape log somewhere.</v>

3235
02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Some rock had to be something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>

3236
02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:54.990
<v Speaker 2>We got to wrap this up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3248
02:25:20.541 --> 02:25:22.011
<v Speaker 2>know it would be a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought that nobody would ever see </v>

3249
02:25:22.011 --> 02:25:22.011
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
