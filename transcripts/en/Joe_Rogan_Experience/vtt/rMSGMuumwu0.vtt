00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>All Right,</v>

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.730
<v Speaker 1>What's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey now,</v>

3
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.050
<v Speaker 1>thanks for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appreciate it.</v>

4
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bigger,</v>

5
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

6
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a documentary that I could not.</v>

7
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so many people that we're </v>

8
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>talking about it if you couldn't avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>like having a conversation about it,</v>

9
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>especially like in the UFC because so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many fighters have been accused of </v>

10
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.361
<v Speaker 1>taking performance enhancing drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many conversations about </v>

11
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:23.361
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:27.681
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always wanted to talk to you guys and </v>

13
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:27.681
<v Speaker 1>I watched it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched,</v>

14
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I watched like the first half of it when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it first came out and I watched it all </v>

15
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>again this morning to check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just get it.</v>

16
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:37.161
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the first time or why didn't you </v>

17
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:37.161
<v Speaker 1>watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the way through,</v>

18
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>but I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was on a plane and I think </v>

19
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>the plane probably landed and I shut my </v>
<v Speaker 1>laptop and I never picked it up again.</v>

20
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>It was one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

21
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>What'd you think of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

22
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Great Documentary and interesting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

23
00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>It was really hilarious when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going over the,</v>

24
00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:53.481
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that like what's the number one </v>

25
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:53.481
<v Speaker 1>reason to go to the hospital and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

26
00:00:53.481 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking vitamin C and then below that </v>

27
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>with steroids and then steroids was way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

28
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:04.341
<v Speaker 1>I think the amount of deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like steroids deaths or like </v>

29
00:01:04.341 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>slightly above water drinking water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

30
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>there's no real proof to link to link </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything scientifically,</v>

31
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:15.141
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a anecdotal evidence on a </v>

32
00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.391
<v Speaker 1>lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nothing scientifically links </v>

33
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>steroids that these deaths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a real problem with some people.</v>

34
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear that and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

35
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hear it because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

36
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>There's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a narrative that we're being </v>

37
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>taught in this country or that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>being told to embrace that narrative is </v>

38
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>steroids are for cheaters and cheaters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>losers and losers on American.</v>

39
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>But as you highlighted in your movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over and over again,</v>

40
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>all these examples of different athletes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were caught with performance </v>

41
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>enhancing drugs was the guy from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tour de France,</v>

42
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:50.841
<v Speaker 1>whether it was Carl Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Carlos thing was fucking hilarious </v>

43
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people don't know when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben Johnson got tested positive for </v>

44
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stripped him of his metal.</v>

45
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>Carl Lewis tested positive for </v>
<v Speaker 1>amphetamines.</v>

46
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't supposed to run.</v>

47
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's the whole thing is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:03.651
<v Speaker 1>they're all doped up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like you said about the narrative </v>

49
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:06.171
<v Speaker 1>that they want you to believe the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative doesn't come from health </v>

50
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The narrative comes from,</v>

51
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's concerned about the health of </v>

52
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 1>the athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We say that,</v>

53
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody really concerned about the </v>

54
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.511
<v Speaker 1>health of the athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're concerned about an unfair </v>

55
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:17.511
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

56
00:02:17.511 --> 00:02:21.771
<v Speaker 1>They're concerned about someone being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to do what we suspected the </v>

57
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Russians were doing back in the fifties.</v>

58
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 1>And that was really enlightening to when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking to that guy that was </v>

59
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.621
<v Speaker 1>saying that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had found out about it from the </v>

60
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:32.811
<v Speaker 1>Russians doing it at 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from then on they were doping and </v>

61
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>over shots of vodka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were actually hanging out with the </v>

62
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Russian strength coach and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:37.141 --> 00:02:42.141
<v Speaker 1>a little loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loosey Goosey and he sort of slipped up </v>

64
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:42.141
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

65
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:45.771
<v Speaker 1>we're given our guys testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as I got out of the bag Dr </v>

66
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Ziglar raced home and he created Diana </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ball,</v>

67
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.100
<v Speaker 1>which was even a stronger steroid then </v>
<v Speaker 1>was currently available on the market </v>

68
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>and they started testing guys with like </v>
<v Speaker 1>five milligrams of Diana Ball.</v>

69
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.810
<v Speaker 1>And of course they found other ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it through the testing facility or </v>

70
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>however they were getting their hands on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it once it was manufactured.</v>

71
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's when it became the wild west.</v>

72
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like people started taking 20 </v>

73
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.131
<v Speaker 1>milligrams and getting way stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of crazy because if you </v>

74
00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get better at something,</v>

75
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:16.741
<v Speaker 1>people don't have a problem with people </v>
<v Speaker 1>using certain means where people don't </v>

76
00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:19.831
<v Speaker 1>have problem with someone to go into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement store and purchasing </v>

77
00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>something that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you take something that's</v>

78
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

79
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

80
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>We don't want you to doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

81
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>I was always tell people the strongest </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit I ever took.</v>

82
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>They made illegal but used to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy the GNC.</v>

83
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.710
<v Speaker 1>It was called Mag 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember that snow?</v>

84
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>totally.</v>

85
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

86
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.850
<v Speaker 1>That stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took that shit for like whatever it </v>

87
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 1>was like six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gained like 10 pounds.</v>

88
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>I was jacked up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like a bunch of pills.</v>

89
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to take like 10 pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after it was over,</v>

90
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.530
<v Speaker 1>my Dick died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it got hit with a media was </v>

91
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was useless.</v>

92
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took me for my testosterone to come </v>

93
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>back and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

94
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>this is steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like real steroids.</v>

95
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>You could buy a GNC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They made it illegal.</v>

96
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:02.221
<v Speaker 1>Those drugs are more dangerous than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual real testosterone and all kinds </v>

97
00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 1>of stuff to the fuck was in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just bought it because it was legal.</v>

98
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Probably a lot of sodium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those pills.</v>

99
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do is they'll give you a,</v>

100
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>a huge surge of estrogen as well for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>girl to now they did.</v>

101
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>And I got lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

102
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>that's what one of the guys was on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>US power lifting team with,</v>

103
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:26.071
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Jenner thinks happened to gender </v>

104
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:26.071
<v Speaker 1>and he believes that.</v>

105
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all he said he knows that they </v>

106
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>had gender pumped full of steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said we were all on steroids.</v>

107
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:36.481
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jana was absolutely pumped full of </v>

108
00:04:36.481 --> 00:04:37.861
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said that was what started his </v>

109
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where I'm heading.</v>

110
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if you drop off a little bit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay on dude,</v>

111
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

112
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But mark and I had this talk the other </v>

113
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>day and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

114
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.640
<v Speaker 1>this whole like gender issue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transgender and all these different </v>

115
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.871
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much that's linked to </v>

116
00:04:57.871 --> 00:04:57.871
<v Speaker 1>testosterone levels are not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the,</v>

117
00:04:57.871 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>if there's that many definitive studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>on like whether your testosterone,</v>

118
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.090
<v Speaker 1>like if you have a high estrogen level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because somebody is going to be </v>

119
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.090
<v Speaker 1>trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have testosterone levels.</v>

120
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people that are gay </v>

121
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:10.141
<v Speaker 1>that are very high testosterone.</v>

122
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:10.141
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can kick ass to there.</v>

123
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

124
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.820
<v Speaker 1>but those are gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

125
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.020
<v Speaker 1>they don't identify as female that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a difference.</v>

126
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>correlates.</v>

127
00:05:18.341 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>I haven't read the studies on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

128
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:24.751
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult for us to understand as </v>

129
00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:24.751
<v Speaker 1>to understand what it's like to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

130
00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you don't get it.</v>

131
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't get any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

132
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.810
<v Speaker 1>like they probably don't get what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to not want to be a woman right </v>

133
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.810
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

134
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.810
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

135
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you sure you don't want to be a </v>

136
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 1>woman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

137
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm good.</v>

138
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

139
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 1>And the power lifting world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>the world power lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been sort of turned on its ear by a</v>

142
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 1>guy named Matt Kroc is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ski marks can tell you a little bit</v>

143
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>more about him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

144
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>he had been friends with him for about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>

145
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've known about his issue for about six</v>

146
00:05:55.121 --> 00:05:59.030
<v Speaker 1>or seven years now and he's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to on my show coming up soon,</v>

147
00:05:59.031 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a transgender and he's,</v>

148
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:06.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ruined relationships for them many </v>

149
00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:06.941
<v Speaker 1>times over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got three kids,</v>

150
00:06:06.941 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>he's a good father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a good person,</v>

151
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>he's a good dude or female.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good woman.</v>

152
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>She's a good woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

153
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:19.781
<v Speaker 1>the issue is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really interesting and that's why I </v>

155
00:06:19.781 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>want to like talk to him and try to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>people just better understand it because</v>

156
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>people get so mad.</v>

157
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing I don't get as he is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do understand voicing your opinion and</v>

158
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck man,</v>

159
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

160
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:33.371
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people actually getting mad and </v>

161
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:33.371
<v Speaker 1>having a committing hate crimes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

162
00:06:33.371 --> 00:06:33.820
<v Speaker 1>To me it's just disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

163
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not on board with that.</v>

164
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is disgusting and I just,</v>

165
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>I got to think that it comes from their </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

166
00:06:38.871 --> 00:06:41.410
<v Speaker 1>from the way they're raised by their </v>
<v Speaker 1>parents are ignorant.</v>

167
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:42.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the only thing that makes any </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

168
00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I just think that we're moving past </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

169
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:50.051
<v Speaker 1>I think there's more awareness and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance for those sorts of issues </v>

170
00:06:50.051 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>that people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that every country worries about.</v>

171
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:55.900
<v Speaker 1>Some fucked up shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot worse going on.</v>

172
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares everyday,</v>

173
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.570
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another cop shooting somebody and we're </v>

174
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.840
<v Speaker 1>worried about concerned ourselves so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more with the tabloid media than we</v>

175
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:10.841
<v Speaker 1>do with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what's really going on in this </v>

176
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:10.841
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

177
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:10.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cops shooting part,</v>

178
00:07:10.841 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a horrible thing,</v>

179
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:14.420
<v Speaker 1>but cops on steroids is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't talk about too much.</v>

180
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hilarious when you see cops</v>

181
00:07:16.581 --> 00:07:21.581
<v Speaker 1>busting people for steroids because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>all know anybody who knows people that </v>

182
00:07:21.711 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>take steroids knows that cops are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids.</v>

183
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giant chunk of them and busted our </v>

184
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>brother would steroids and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably on it when they were busted and</v>

185
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>confiscated every cop in poughkeepsie </v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're from,</v>

186
00:07:36.111 --> 00:07:37.980
<v Speaker 1>got huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had,</v>

187
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 1>they took like a thousand pills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Diana ball from him.</v>

188
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.810
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know that cops are </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around all jack.</v>

189
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had A.</v>

190
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I had talked to a guy who was a cop I </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to workout with and he had a </v>

191
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 1>rational explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

192
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:52.640
<v Speaker 1>look man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

193
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:54.320
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking gross out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

194
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>it's dangerous as fuck and you got to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of your game and you want to have</v>

195
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 1>an edge.</v>

196
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

197
00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>dude was five slash 70 weight to 50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

198
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:05.160
<v Speaker 1>you've got a couple of edges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>edges all over your body,</v>

199
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 1>so fucking jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how do you even move like that?</v>

200
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.850
<v Speaker 1>That's not very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

201
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.850
<v Speaker 1>someone would have to do is get ahold of</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and hang on.</v>

202
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:18.300
<v Speaker 1>You got to do with a guy like that as </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride the bull will send them.</v>

203
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you taught those guys what you know </v>

204
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.601
<v Speaker 1>in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be much more effective than </v>

205
00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:25.601
<v Speaker 1>taking steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably the easier route.</v>

206
00:08:25.601 --> 00:08:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would help,</v>

207
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:31.331
<v Speaker 1>but the real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is you're dealing with guns </v>

208
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:31.850
<v Speaker 1>and knives and shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how big you are,</v>

209
00:08:31.851 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even really matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

210
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.930
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely should know how to defend</v>

211
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>yourself physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

212
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 1>Every cop should be a black belt in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

213
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:45.131
<v Speaker 1>you should know what it's like to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a wild melee with another person who's </v>

214
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill you with their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not going to protect you from</v>

215
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:51.060
<v Speaker 1>guns and knives and all that and gun </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense stuff like that's,</v>

216
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>that's an art in and of itself.</v>

217
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>there's some guys who are experts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>guns away from people and Shit.</v>

219
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:00.870
<v Speaker 1>But good luck with all the major </v>
<v Speaker 1>differences between like UFC and pride.</v>

220
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Pride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they really had rules.</v>

221
00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely had rules.</v>

222
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:07.080
<v Speaker 1>They had no elbows and that was just </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned testing wise.</v>

223
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing wise.</v>

224
00:09:08.371 --> 00:09:08.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

225
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:10.470
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have rules at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

226
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>they specifically said on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>contracts that there was no,</v>

227
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>no test steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

228
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.040
<v Speaker 1>ensign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

229
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Who's one of the fighters from pride?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great guy fought in UFC as well.</v>

230
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.750
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

231
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.870
<v Speaker 1>he did this whole thing about it where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he came on the podcast and explain like </v>

232
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.670
<v Speaker 1>the verbatim contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It said we are not going to test.</v>

233

<v Speaker 1>fight in Japan.</v>

238

<v Speaker 1>like they were like really sold on him </v>

241

<v Speaker 1>being one of the five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted big Americans.</v>

242
00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:54.750
<v Speaker 1>They wanted everyone to look like Mark </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kerr.</v>

243
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.270
<v Speaker 1>Remember my.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was amazing as smashing machine.</v>

244
00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.780
<v Speaker 1>That's smashing machine as a documentary</v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmaker.</v>

245
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:03.570
<v Speaker 1>That was my favorite documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the sale is to we ever.</v>

246
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing documentary and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks who don't know what it's about,</v>

247
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:11.751
<v Speaker 1>it's about Mark Kerr who was at the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most dangerous mma fighters </v>

248
00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 1>and more like a guy who you would look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at and you'd say,</v>

249
00:10:13.471 --> 00:10:15.900
<v Speaker 1>well that is what an MMA fighter should </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>

250
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Two hundred 60 pounds fucking Jack to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tits.</v>

251
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Just giant and smashing people.</v>

252
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.600
<v Speaker 1>But they caught him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There he is right there at his prime.</v>

253
00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.240
<v Speaker 1>What a fucking shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

254
00:10:27.241 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 1>that's a good picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They caught him right when he slid.</v>

255
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:36.590
<v Speaker 1>They caught.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They literally caught him on top before </v>

256
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.060
<v Speaker 1>he'd slipped and then went into this mad</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking painkiller slide.</v>

257
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.560
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens to everybody.</v>

258
00:10:40.561 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's what happened in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pro wrestling,</v>

259
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.770
<v Speaker 1>which were like really closely </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with all these guys.</v>

260
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>You didn't hear about the wrestlers </v>
<v Speaker 1>dying and everything.</v>

261
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily the steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a deadly cocktail that they're all </v>

262
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.960
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steroids are a big part of it,</v>

263
00:10:54.961 --> 00:10:59.961
<v Speaker 1>but that's the steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tiny in comparison to the head </v>

264
00:10:59.961 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 1>injured is important to point out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're not safe.</v>

265
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:07.281
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think sometimes people that take </v>

266
00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:07.281
<v Speaker 1>them are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah man,</v>

267
00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:07.520
<v Speaker 1>take steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They definitely have their,</v>

268
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.360
<v Speaker 1>their drawbacks and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely,</v>

269
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:11.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a drug and it's an illegal drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

270
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:12.720
<v Speaker 1>so that always needs to be done dose.</v>

271
00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:13.520
<v Speaker 1>It's well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

272
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:18.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people that are gonna take a </v>

273
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.851
<v Speaker 1>little bit and be fine or there's people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are going to go off the rails and </v>

274
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:23.450
<v Speaker 1>like there was a dude that we knew that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a detour Belfort's trainer in the </v>

275
00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 1>nineties and he died really young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She died like 32 or 33.</v>

276
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 1>We used to call them garden hoses </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he would work out.</v>

277
00:11:28.741 --> 00:11:31.670
<v Speaker 1>He would be purple and it's fucking arms</v>
<v Speaker 1>veins.</v>

278
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Curtis left purple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

279
00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:37.050
<v Speaker 1>They call him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call the Barney at the gym.</v>

280
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>They'd call him Barney because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>so purple.</v>

281
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.670
<v Speaker 1>He was nicest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sales guy.</v>

282
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.230
<v Speaker 1>Really great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

283
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 1>and veto or at the time was Jack Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was training at golds Venice.</v>

284
00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.040
<v Speaker 1>He almost got to Jack Memory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came in,</v>

285
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.490
<v Speaker 1>smoked everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden he got like kind of</v>

286
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 1>too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he fought randy,</v>

287
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:58.621
<v Speaker 1>he was too big and it was like 2:40</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fought randy and he had no gas </v>

288
00:11:58.621 --> 00:11:58.621
<v Speaker 1>tank.</v>

289
00:11:58.621 --> 00:11:58.870
<v Speaker 1>He was using specimen when he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>younger.</v>

290
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 1>When he was 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was 200 pounds.</v>

291
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:05.020
<v Speaker 1>He was like the perfect size because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vito has like a size eight foot.</v>

292
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.320
<v Speaker 1>He's not a big guy like his hands are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly small too,</v>

293
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 1>but he's just a spectacular athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

294
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.230
<v Speaker 1>He's done it for so long and believable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it is and it's.</v>

295
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting point because v tour</v>

296
00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:23.190
<v Speaker 1>for the last year and a half was on </v>
<v Speaker 1>testosterone replacement last like two </v>

297
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 1>years and had the most spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 1>results of his career.</v>

298
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:30.931
<v Speaker 1>It was really crazy to see a guy who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been fighting since 1997 in the UFC and </v>

299
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 1>he's knocking out Michael Bisping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's knocked out Luke rockhold,</v>

300
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:40.140
<v Speaker 1>Dan Henderson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's we'll kicking people in the head </v>

301
00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:40.990
<v Speaker 1>with the way he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just fucking crazy to watch.</v>

302
00:12:40.991 --> 00:12:45.991
<v Speaker 1>He had kicked three of the best fighters</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and did it with muscles </v>

303
00:12:45.991 --> 00:12:49.990
<v Speaker 1>grown out of his fucking teeth mean just</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal in the UFC was legal.</v>

304
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It's honestly therapeutic use then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

305
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but now it's a lot of came in and went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

306
00:12:55.331 --> 00:12:57.280
<v Speaker 1>hold the fuck up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on here?</v>

307
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:58.540
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had guys.</v>

308
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.720
<v Speaker 1>There were guys that were in their </v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties that had been prescribed it </v>

309
00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:03.720
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

310
00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.510
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

311
00:13:04.511 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have a load test?</v>

312
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:10.140
<v Speaker 1>And most of them it's because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroid use and we all know that there's</v>

313
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.150
<v Speaker 1>a way of manipulating those tests and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe some are overtrained not sleeping </v>

314
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.291
<v Speaker 1>well on top of 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't think those tests get </v>

315
00:13:19.291 --> 00:13:20.320
<v Speaker 1>manipulated into like what you'd need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do in bigger,</v>

316
00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:21.010
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>

317
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I show you how to get human growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormone and basically,</v>

318
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to your doctor and do this and that.</v>

319
00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:30.151
<v Speaker 1>And the way that you take the test was </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to like pee in this bag </v>

320
00:13:30.151 --> 00:13:31.330
<v Speaker 1>basically all day long.</v>

321
00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.400
<v Speaker 1>And then you take a sample of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>urine.</v>

322
00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

323
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:39.631
<v Speaker 1>the way that I did it was I only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I only took the urine from like two </v>

324
00:13:39.851 --> 00:13:42.850
<v Speaker 1>samples that were taken at night when </v>
<v Speaker 1>your growth hormone is the lowest.</v>

325
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 1>So my growth hormone looked like it came</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a guy who's 125 years old.</v>

326
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.040
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

327
00:13:48.041 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 1>you have no growth when I'm on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ticket in the morning.</v>

328
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.130
<v Speaker 1>It would have and balance it out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the day would have been normal.</v>

329
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.140
<v Speaker 1>It would have been normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was really low,</v>

330
00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:01.380
<v Speaker 1>so I just wanted the doctor to give me </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth hormone to see if they would do </v>

331
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:01.380
<v Speaker 1>it for the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

332
00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:05.560
<v Speaker 1>the also they say if you eat a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>large fatty meal like cheeseburgers and </v>

333
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.210
<v Speaker 1>fries and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a big burger,</v>

334
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 1>like right before you take the test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like within an hour,</v>

335
00:14:09.251 --> 00:14:10.840
<v Speaker 1>the test shit just plummets.</v>

336
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Your test plummets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your growth plummets.</v>

337
00:14:13.511 --> 00:14:15.250
<v Speaker 1>Everything just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

338
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:16.750
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's ways to beat all these tests.</v>

339
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Even even the guys that are beating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>test,</v>

340
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:20.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to compete.</v>

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.590
<v Speaker 1>the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired him to try to clean up the sport.</v>

348
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's like going to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hoarder's house like you need to hire.</v>

349
00:14:39.221 --> 00:14:43.510
<v Speaker 1>The other guy will eat off this floor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hire a Ferrari guy.</v>

350
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:48.190
<v Speaker 1>The guy that was the Lance Armstrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>coach I was trying to do,</v>

351
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.500
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cheaters will always be ahead</v>

352
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 2>of the guys that are trying to catch </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

353
00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 2>It's just a cat and mouse game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been going on forever.</v>

354
00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they were kind of ahead.</v>

355
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.860
<v Speaker 2>Now what they're doing now is they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

356
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.480
<v Speaker 2>the way they make testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently they do something with yams.</v>

357
00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.400
<v Speaker 2>That's how they make it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know the Mexican Wild Yams?</v>

358
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:10.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now do that thing where it's </v>

359
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:10.440
<v Speaker 2>derived from or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

360
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Well now they figured out how to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>with animals and they have made a </v>

361
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.620
<v Speaker 2>bioidentical testosterone that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't differentiate.</v>

362
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.300
<v Speaker 2>We just spoke about a stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

363
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.340
<v Speaker 2>stem cells aren't going to be a human,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but stem cells are going to allow you a </v>

364
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Vito Belfort right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that he can't do the testosterone </v>

365
00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:32.471
<v Speaker 2>replacement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets stem cells done to all of his </v>

366
00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:32.471
<v Speaker 2>existing injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

367
00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:35.450
<v Speaker 2>he basically got a clean slate and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's back to normal.</v>

368
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 2>I know where to draw the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess built over time,</v>

369
00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:43.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a baseball pitcher can pitch 10 more </v>

370
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:43.300
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>

371
00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.741
<v Speaker 2>how is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how is that going to affect the future </v>

372
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:48.551
<v Speaker 2>of sports with the records and all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like who can hit the most home </v>

373
00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:48.551
<v Speaker 2>runs and who can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

374
00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 2>play the longest and all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a word that's a banned</v>

375
00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steroids is like,</v>

376
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

377
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.030
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a negative word.</v>

378
00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.740
<v Speaker 2>My word will never be polished up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Granted me and it's like the Barry Bonds</v>

379
00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 2>Shit with mark mcgwire all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>

380
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.390
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of my favorite parts of the</v>

381
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 2>documentary was watching those dummies </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Congress.</v>

382
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.120
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing to see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Joe Biden talk about memory when I </v>

383
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.290
<v Speaker 2>was a good athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought at the fuck you were,</v>

384
00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.650
<v Speaker 2>you were never a good athlete.</v>

385
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:23.650
<v Speaker 2>I would like to that sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took it away from me and it wasn't </v>

386
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.821
<v Speaker 2>by God given talent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like third string baseball player,</v>

387
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.020
<v Speaker 2>like community college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever he was save it,</v>

388
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:34.820
<v Speaker 2>but whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just shut your mouth.</v>

389
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

390
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.480
<v Speaker 2>The thing was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bring up these baseball players and</v>

391
00:16:38.481 --> 00:16:41.690
<v Speaker 2>string them up before Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes this huge media circus.</v>

392
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:44.350
<v Speaker 2>Everybody loves to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll look at their,</v>

393
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pointing out all these guys and </v>

394
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.401
<v Speaker 2>they're the bad guys and you have guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Mark Maguire up there looking like </v>

395
00:16:51.401 --> 00:16:51.890
<v Speaker 2>mark McGuire said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids is bad.</v>

396
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.600
<v Speaker 2>It's a bad message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do them.</v>

397
00:16:53.601 --> 00:16:54.830
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is people.</v>

398
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.690
<v Speaker 2>These are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are these heroes too.</v>

399
00:16:56.691 --> 00:17:00.800
<v Speaker 2>These kids up there that are completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking like idiots and there's a better</v>

400
00:17:00.801 --> 00:17:01.570
<v Speaker 2>way to handle it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

401
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:06.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just seemed really frivolous that </v>

402
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:06.910
<v Speaker 2>they were in front of Congress for the.</v>

403
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.080
<v Speaker 2>They're getting too good at hitting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball with the stick.</v>

404
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.940
<v Speaker 2>We need to bring in all our leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

405
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 2>Same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't even seem real.</v>

406
00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a good plot in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in swimming,</v>

407
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:20.120
<v Speaker 2>they made suits a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got rid of them right away.</v>

408
00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:25.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a speedo company made a suit that </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes you swim faster and as soon as </v>

409
00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:25.590
<v Speaker 2>they did that they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

410
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.500
<v Speaker 2>we don't want you to swim in that fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they got rid of them.</v>

411
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.070
<v Speaker 2>So it was like a body suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like your whole body as the body suit.</v>

412
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.550
<v Speaker 2>So like a wetsuit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

413
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:37.850
<v Speaker 2>I think it helped increase like buoyancy</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit and just helped you kind of</v>

414
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:40.280
<v Speaker 2>glide through the pool faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty dope.</v>

415
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.450
<v Speaker 2>We're got one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I guess the,</v>

416
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.350
<v Speaker 2>the issue with it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's expensive and so they were like,</v>

417
00:17:45.351 --> 00:17:50.351
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might price some people out of it or </v>

418
00:17:50.351 --> 00:17:50.351
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

419
00:17:50.351 --> 00:17:50.351
<v Speaker 2>I don't really even understand what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

420
00:17:50.351 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 3>All these sports end up being pretty </v>
<v Speaker 3>expensive.</v>

421
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:56.901
<v Speaker 3>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The amount of money that's involved in </v>

422
00:17:56.901 --> 00:17:59.271
<v Speaker 3>training for the Olympics for swimming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are going on now with </v>

423
00:17:59.271 --> 00:17:59.340
<v Speaker 3>training are insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

424
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:04.341
<v Speaker 3>I did my second film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did a movie called trophy kids and it's </v>

425
00:18:04.341 --> 00:18:06.270
<v Speaker 3>about parents that push their kids in </v>
<v Speaker 3>sports and that was on hbo and the thing</v>

426
00:18:06.271 --> 00:18:11.271
<v Speaker 3>that is so crazy now is the way that </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents have access to all these things </v>

427
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:13.530
<v Speaker 3>we didn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you'll go to a,</v>

428
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

429
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.880
<v Speaker 3>a baseball camp and they have like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nike makes his hand eye coordination </v>

430
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.420
<v Speaker 3>thing that you wouldn't believe how it </v>
<v Speaker 3>tells you,</v>

431
00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:22.860
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what position your kid should play.</v>

432
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.790
<v Speaker 3>It tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

433
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:29.120
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and parents are actually going and </v>

434
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.801
<v Speaker 3>getting genetic testing on their kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They swab the inside of their kids a </v>

435
00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:32.160
<v Speaker 3>cheek and they send it off to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>company and it,</v>

436
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.570
<v Speaker 3>it'll tell the parent what sports.</v>

437
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:34.920
<v Speaker 3>The kid will be good at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This one,</v>

438
00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:39.940
<v Speaker 3>they're like an infant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's some crazy stuff going on </v>

439
00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.080
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where,</v>

440
00:18:40.081 --> 00:18:41.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

441
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.820
<v Speaker 3>technology is far exceeding like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

442
00:18:43.821 --> 00:18:46.610
<v Speaker 3>what we've been able to do before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's fucking madness.</v>

443
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:51.030
<v Speaker 3>Robbing your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cheat to find out what sport they should</v>

444
00:18:51.031 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

445
00:18:51.421 --> 00:18:52.490
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a um,</v>

446
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.560
<v Speaker 3>California cryobank.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a sperm bank and it's a at </v>

447
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:01.341
<v Speaker 3>Ucla.</v>

448
00:19:01.341 --> 00:19:03.591
<v Speaker 3>frozen into the fuck the therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arthritis.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Great job.</v>

450
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Speaker 3>Joe Rogan was fucking shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tastes great.</v>

451
00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can get,</v>

452
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:19.560
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually shows a guy on HBO,</v>

453
00:19:19.561 --> 00:19:24.561
<v Speaker 3>Real Sports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes in and basically like they </v>

454
00:19:24.561 --> 00:19:25.200
<v Speaker 3>custom order their kid and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 3>this fat,</v>

455
00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:28.320
<v Speaker 3>what the hell?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this fat Mexican guy.</v>

456
00:19:28.321 --> 00:19:31.040
<v Speaker 3>He goes in and he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want a kid just like me,</v>

457
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.390
<v Speaker 3>blue eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blonde hair and big calves.</v>

458
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 3>And it's like he looks nothing like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>

459
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:42.080
<v Speaker 3>So it's not his sperm as someone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>using a sperm donor because he couldn't </v>

460
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.100
<v Speaker 3>get his wife pregnant and they decide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we want our kid to be.</v>

461
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.940
<v Speaker 3>The father is similar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>similar to similar to me,</v>

462
00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like athletic and outgoing and you know,</v>

463
00:19:50.601 --> 00:19:53.380
<v Speaker 3>so they picked a six,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two blonde haired blue eyed kid with a.</v>

464
00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.400
<v Speaker 3>and it actually says on the application,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge gaps,</v>

465
00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.670
<v Speaker 3>huge calves on the application.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck they,</v>

466
00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:05.910
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the California cryobank goes out and </v>

467
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:05.910
<v Speaker 3>they recruit players.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

468
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 3>I went to USC.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I know it goes on at USC,</v>

469
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:10.740
<v Speaker 3>they go out and recruit players to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>extra money.</v>

470
00:20:10.741 --> 00:20:15.741
<v Speaker 3>You can make 900 bucks a month or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something jerking off in a cup and </v>

471
00:20:15.741 --> 00:20:18.690
<v Speaker 3>basically selling it to my parents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good deal.</v>

472
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Bad deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you have rent,</v>

473
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.370
<v Speaker 3>you gotta pay it somehow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spring might be tainted probably.</v>

474
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't need to know that.</v>

475
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:34.070
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an amazing phenomenon to see </v>

476
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.200
<v Speaker 3>parents now getting into like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how am I going to help my kid sheet?</v>

477
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's getting to the point also where </v>

478
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:39.520
<v Speaker 3>they're within a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you heard of Crispr?</v>

479
00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Do you know what Crispr is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

480
00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.860
<v Speaker 3>There's a radio lab documentary they did</v>
<v Speaker 3>on it.</v>

481
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.050
<v Speaker 3>It's a or a radio lab episode rather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all about um,</v>

482
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 3>this new tool that they have for</v>

483
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.040
<v Speaker 1>engineering genetics and for splicing </v>
<v Speaker 1>genes and for adding traits or </v>

484
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 1>subtracting traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

485
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:55.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you showed him the documentary,</v>

486
00:20:55.691 --> 00:21:00.691
<v Speaker 1>the milestone and hypocrisies of doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with these cows that make these cows </v>

487
00:21:00.691 --> 00:21:01.180
<v Speaker 1>grow enormous amounts of muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

488
00:21:01.181 --> 00:21:02.530
<v Speaker 1>they're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

489
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:05.350
<v Speaker 1>they could do it now to pigs and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to do it to people.</v>

490
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:08.410
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of when she's used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be in a year.</v>

491
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be in a decade?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>

492
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.260
<v Speaker 1>If we live another 100 years of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings survive 100 years and the </v>

493
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 1>asteroids don't blow us up or we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>get hit by a fucking nuke.</v>

494
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.300
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna have myostatin inhibited </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that it looked like the hall </v>

495
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:28.320
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking crazy and it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be nuts and they're going to live </v>

496
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:28.320
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's even more fucked up.</v>

497
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.440
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about steroids in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC?</v>

498
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what's your take on it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they should be illegal or </v>

499
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.470
<v Speaker 1>monitored or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

500
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:38.141
<v Speaker 1>I think she's gonna be a moot point once</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to genetic engineering and I </v>

501
00:21:38.141 --> 00:21:41.590
<v Speaker 1>think ultimately what steroids are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's a form of engineering.</v>

502
00:21:41.591 --> 00:21:46.591
<v Speaker 1>It's a form of biological engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're taking these substances and </v>

503
00:21:46.591 --> 00:21:48.370
<v Speaker 1>you're adding people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you pointed out in your,</v>

504
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:51.100
<v Speaker 1>in your documentary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the guy who was the,</v>

505
00:21:51.101 --> 00:21:51.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

506
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.670
<v Speaker 1>the Tour de France guy that had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen tent,</v>

507
00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
<v Speaker 1>these hyperbaric chamber to Chambers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperbaric chambers.</v>

508
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:03.340
<v Speaker 1>What I do all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cryogenic freezing tanks,</v>

509
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.470
<v Speaker 1>all that shit is cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

510
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:07.640
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take trt,</v>

511
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I'd take human growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I was competing in a somewhere that </v>

512
00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:13.690
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't let me take that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be considered cheating.</v>

513
00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:15.940
<v Speaker 1>But for life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'm like,</v>

514
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:21.060
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're 48 years old and you're not </v>

515
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.060
<v Speaker 1>taking testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you hate?</v>

516
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.300
<v Speaker 1>Life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd hate having energy started </v>

517
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:24.420
<v Speaker 1>throwing it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your immune system sucks.</v>

518
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 1>You want to feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look better.</v>

519
00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 1>Your body works better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about simple.</v>

520
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.650
<v Speaker 1>Optimizing what you already are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think when people go beyond that,</v>

521
00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:34.330
<v Speaker 1>that's when it becomes into like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

522
00:22:34.331 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 1>well that it's cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why people think that,</v>

523
00:22:36.551 --> 00:22:37.750
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

524
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you say,</v>

525
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:39.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on trt,</v>

526
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.140
<v Speaker 1>nobody really cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

527
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:43.160
<v Speaker 1>And the same commercials for tea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our tea,</v>

528
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but during the world series,</v>

529
00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.390
<v Speaker 1>the same sport that they condemn for </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids during the commercial break,</v>

530
00:22:49.391 --> 00:22:51.340
<v Speaker 1>the first commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have low t?</v>

531
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

532
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 1>that's the very first commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hilarious.</v>

533
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that the issue with steroids </v>
<v Speaker 1>also for a lot of people is they believe</v>

534
00:22:58.241 --> 00:23:03.241
<v Speaker 1>that it's going to get kids into them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the kids are gonna get sick or </v>

535
00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:04.090
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get hurt or they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna commit suicide.</v>

536
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Like the guy in the documentary had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was convinced that his kid who we had</v>

537
00:23:07.301 --> 00:23:09.760
<v Speaker 1>on Lexapro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was a teenager,</v>

538
00:23:09.761 --> 00:23:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was convinced that with steroids that</v>

539
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:17.101
<v Speaker 1>made this kid commit suicide and </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids very well may have played a </v>

540
00:23:17.101 --> 00:23:18.240
<v Speaker 1>factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abuse of anything is bad.</v>

541
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.460
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's abuse of alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different drugs,</v>

542
00:23:21.461 --> 00:23:23.980
<v Speaker 1>painkillers that you can abuse that'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>make you suicidal.</v>

543
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Abuse of anything is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to blame it on one thing that guy had</v>

544
00:23:29.171 --> 00:23:34.171
<v Speaker 1>this blanket thought in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's just going to throw a blanket over </v>

545
00:23:34.171 --> 00:23:34.171
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with steroids,</v>

546
00:23:34.171 --> 00:23:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't even think you can blame it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lexapro.</v>

547
00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.250
<v Speaker 1>There's a deeper issue going on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

548
00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:40.300
<v Speaker 1>with the child takes his own life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had,</v>

549
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.360
<v Speaker 1>he certainly had some issues and he also</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to communicate with his </v>

550
00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:46.030
<v Speaker 1>parents these issues too much and the</v>

551
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.760
<v Speaker 2>going on with that story that I put in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie and that was to protect the </v>

552
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.370
<v Speaker 2>company's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

553
00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody loses a child.</v>

554
00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go into a family history</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these other things that we found</v>

555
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

556
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.560
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely hard for you for doing </v>

557
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:05.560
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

558
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.370
<v Speaker 2>they gave his father a million dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go in front to,</v>

559
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.700
<v Speaker 2>to continue this education to continue a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lying to people basically.</v>

560
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Well that makes sense because that's why</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had this thought in his head,</v>

561
00:24:16.401 --> 00:24:21.401
<v Speaker 2>like he wouldn't even consider the fact </v>
<v Speaker 2>that these kids are on psychoactive </v>

562
00:24:21.401 --> 00:24:25.301
<v Speaker 2>drugs and he would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those had nothing to do with the fact </v>

563
00:24:25.301 --> 00:24:25.660
<v Speaker 2>that his brain was fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

564
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:27.340
<v Speaker 2>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to know.</v>

565
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:28.810
<v Speaker 2>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those drugs are,</v>

566
00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.620
<v Speaker 2>are dangerous to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a hundred years,</v>

567
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.850
<v Speaker 2>100 million people walking around on </v>
<v Speaker 2>psych meds and there's really no proof </v>

568
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:36.850
<v Speaker 2>that they actually work.</v>

569
00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:41.830
<v Speaker 2>There's really no scientific proof that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they improve any sort of a problem with.</v>

570
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:47.840
<v Speaker 2>Is that true though?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because they definitely do help some </v>

571
00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.051
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they definitely helped some </v>

572
00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:50.051
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's actually nothing.</v>

573
00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:50.051
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

574
00:24:50.051 --> 00:24:50.280
<v Speaker 2>if you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can look at a,</v>

575
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:52.010
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anecdotal evidence for anything.</v>

576
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:54.440
<v Speaker 2>I took this and I got bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got stronger,</v>

577
00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:59.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific proof now because there's no </v>

578
00:24:59.770 --> 00:24:59.960
<v Speaker 2>real markers in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no test I can give you to see if</v>

579
00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:00.900
<v Speaker 2>you feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

580
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.750
<v Speaker 2>There's no depression tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

581
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:03.770
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

582
00:25:03.771 --> 00:25:06.170
<v Speaker 2>that's the issue there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is,</v>

583
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of evidence that Ssri </v>
<v Speaker 2>helped improve mood.</v>

584
00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:10.690
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they do,</v>

585
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

586
00:25:11.571 --> 00:25:13.810
<v Speaker 2>But there's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>

587
00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:18.810
<v Speaker 2>While they improve mood and some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people commit suicide on them </v>

588
00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:22.930
<v Speaker 2>because they are so low down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'll see a person that's like </v>

589
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:22.930
<v Speaker 2>severely severely depressed.</v>

590
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Speaker 2>They can't even get out of bed to kill </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>

591
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:29.531
<v Speaker 2>And then they put them on an Ssri and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now they haven't just enough energy to </v>

592
00:25:29.531 --> 00:25:29.850
<v Speaker 2>say fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

593
00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:35.570
<v Speaker 2>that's what's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also with steroids though,</v>

594
00:25:35.571 --> 00:25:38.480
<v Speaker 2>when you know that kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just stopped cold Turkey,</v>

595
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:43.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he stopped the steroids right away and </v>

596
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:43.660
<v Speaker 2>then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>went on those other drugs,</v>

597
00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:44.060
<v Speaker 2>but stopping him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you mentioned earlier,</v>

598
00:25:44.061 --> 00:25:47.360
<v Speaker 2>like if you're 48 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to get the energy boost from.</v>

599
00:25:47.361 --> 00:25:51.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like coming off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm actually a puts you at a lower state</v>

600
00:25:51.051 --> 00:25:53.590
<v Speaker 2>than you ever were before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with that kid coming off him,</v>

601
00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.790
<v Speaker 2>his testosterone levels are probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>low.</v>

602
00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Is estrone levels probably came up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably just insanely depressed.</v>

603
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.090
<v Speaker 2>That does get you depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a big issue with fighters and</v>

604
00:26:02.091 --> 00:26:04.580
<v Speaker 2>football players and people that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>had a lot of head injuries.</v>

605
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Dr Mark Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was in your documentary for a brief </v>

606
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:10.090
<v Speaker 2>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw his face in there.</v>

607
00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:11.870
<v Speaker 2>He works with a lot of traumatic brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>injury people.</v>

608
00:26:11.871 --> 00:26:13.180
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that he finds </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

609
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:15.130
<v Speaker 2>they almost all have low testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

610
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Something about getting the pituitary </v>
<v Speaker 2>gland rattled.</v>

611
00:26:18.201 --> 00:26:21.050
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's through an IED or football </v>
<v Speaker 2>collisions or head kicks,</v>

612
00:26:21.051 --> 00:26:26.051
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of those guys have low </v>

613
00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:26.051
<v Speaker 2>testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just like super.</v>

614
00:26:26.051 --> 00:26:26.500
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like getting kicked in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>balls.</v>

615
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.690
<v Speaker 2>You ever posed the question to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>athlete,</v>

616
00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.580
<v Speaker 2>a Nevada state athletic commission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

617
00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:32.020
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

618
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 2>all these guys are getting pounded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the head and the UFC,</v>

619
00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.230
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get punched a lot.</v>

620
00:26:36.231 --> 00:26:37.740
<v Speaker 2>They get kicked a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

621
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:43.620
<v Speaker 2>had head trauma is a on the job injury,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're not allowed to treat.</v>

622
00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:44.220
<v Speaker 2>And on the job</v>

623
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.380
<v Speaker 1>injury with something that works like </v>
<v Speaker 1>human growth hormone,</v>

624
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:51.381
<v Speaker 1>like you'll talk to mark Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll tell you one of the best things </v>

625
00:26:51.381 --> 00:26:54.381
<v Speaker 1>they can do to treat these concussions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and traumatic brain injuries is to </v>

626
00:26:54.381 --> 00:26:56.130
<v Speaker 1>supplement with human growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't treat those injuries.</v>

627
00:26:56.430 --> 00:27:01.430
<v Speaker 1>You can get them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a normal everyday person </v>

628
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.681
<v Speaker 1>you can be treated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be treated if you are a </v>

629
00:27:03.681 --> 00:27:03.681
<v Speaker 1>fighter or if you're an athlete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

630
00:27:03.681 --> 00:27:05.850
<v Speaker 1>And if there's a thing with fighters as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

631
00:27:05.851 --> 00:27:09.120
<v Speaker 1>now they're not allowing them to use ivs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to rehydrate.</v>

632
00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why is because ivs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>use of ivs can mask some of the signs of</v>

633
00:27:14.611 --> 00:27:19.611
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so something that was ultimately very </v>

634
00:27:19.611 --> 00:27:21.420
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you can't use because people can use</v>

635
00:27:21.421 --> 00:27:26.421
<v Speaker 1>it to cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though it's just to rehydrate </v>

636
00:27:26.421 --> 00:27:26.940
<v Speaker 1>you and even if they can prove that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just rehydrating you,</v>

637
00:27:26.941 --> 00:27:31.941
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't use it because it could be </v>

638
00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:34.221
<v Speaker 1>something that you're doing because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually probably healthier for </v>

639
00:27:34.221 --> 00:27:37.761
<v Speaker 1>the fighter like a day before to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>all those electrolytes in them and </v>

640
00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:37.761
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

641
00:27:37.761 --> 00:27:41.450
<v Speaker 1>And I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean rather than fight completed as </v>

642
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:41.450
<v Speaker 1>soon as you're cutting weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

643
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's some arguments.</v>

644
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's,</v>

645
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:49.431
<v Speaker 1>I haven't researched it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some people that say that </v>

646
00:27:49.431 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 1>it's actually more effective to </v>
<v Speaker 1>rehydrate orally.</v>

647
00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.720
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that's true.</v>

648
00:27:51.721 --> 00:27:56.721
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to talk to an expert about </v>

649
00:27:56.721 --> 00:27:56.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do a google lead hard.</v>

650
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:02.030
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to be way on top of all that </v>

651
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.030
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you're,</v>

652
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

653
00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:02.670
<v Speaker 1>these fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they travel,</v>

654
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in power lifting.</v>

655
00:28:03.601 --> 00:28:05.950
<v Speaker 1>We do the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we use ivy bags,</v>

656
00:28:05.951 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 1>so to rehydrate and guys we'll do 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>pound weight cuts and stuff like that.</v>

657
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:14.630
<v Speaker 1>So you do 30 pound weight cuts so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you competed a lower level to power </v>

658
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.630
<v Speaker 1>lift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

659
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.830
<v Speaker 1>lighter weight classes.</v>

660
00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.140
<v Speaker 1>You're not getting hit in the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

661
00:28:16.141 --> 00:28:18.570
<v Speaker 1>the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rehydration orally.</v>

662
00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:23.571
<v Speaker 1>If it's not effective as if you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you fight in a dehydrated state and </v>

663
00:28:23.571 --> 00:28:24.450
<v Speaker 1>you get rattled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain bleeds.</v>

664
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say that almost all the deaths and pro</v>

665
00:28:26.521 --> 00:28:31.521
<v Speaker 1>boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them were in the lighter </v>

666
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:31.521
<v Speaker 1>weight divisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

667
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:31.521
<v Speaker 1>Even though the heavyweights hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest,</v>

668
00:28:31.521 --> 00:28:34.340
<v Speaker 1>they didn't cut weight so they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have all that same problem.</v>

669
00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Is there any rules in UFC about cutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>weight?</v>

670
00:28:36.001 --> 00:28:39.900
<v Speaker 1>How much percentage cut there should be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can make the way you can fight,</v>

671
00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.930
<v Speaker 1>you just have to make the weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four o'clock on Friday and then </v>

672
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.141
<v Speaker 1>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know whenever your fight is the </v>

673
00:28:48.141 --> 00:28:48.141
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't start till four.</v>

674
00:28:48.141 --> 00:28:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this thing will change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>game?</v>

675
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:53.870
<v Speaker 1>I hope it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think the UFC probably is going </v>

676
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.611
<v Speaker 1>to have to add more weight classes </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually because there's not enough </v>

677
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:56.611
<v Speaker 1>way classes.</v>

678
00:28:56.611 --> 00:28:57.930
<v Speaker 1>There's some big gaps between like one </v>
<v Speaker 1>85 and two.</v>

679
00:28:57.931 --> 00:28:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 20 pound weight class.</v>

680
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a giant gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

681
00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I think that for fighters that are like </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweeners,</v>

682
00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:09.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's guys that are like a little bit </v>

683
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.431
<v Speaker 1>too big for this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit too small for that </v>

684
00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:10.431
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could use a one 95.</v>

685
00:29:10.431 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I think every 10 pounds we've saved like</v>
<v Speaker 1>be an advantage to actual,</v>

686
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the fans and need to be more,</v>

687
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.370
<v Speaker 1>more champions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more championship fights,</v>

688
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:22.371
<v Speaker 1>more money and then also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be some reasonable like a </v>

689
00:29:22.371 --> 00:29:24.510
<v Speaker 1>champion versus champion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one 95 versus two.</v>

690
00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five was pretty reasonable.</v>

691
00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like one 85 versus two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh five.</v>

692
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Like massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big fucking jump for those guys.</v>

693
00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.960
<v Speaker 1>I think to answer your question about </v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids in the UFC,</v>

694
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to kind of define.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real problem is what we said</v>

695
00:29:38.371 --> 00:29:41.780
<v Speaker 1>earlier that the word steroid is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like</v>

696
00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:47.030
<v Speaker 2>did it's a dirty word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's far as like supplements are </v>

697
00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:49.950
<v Speaker 2>supplements be legal Kinda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody says supplements,</v>

698
00:29:49.951 --> 00:29:50.500
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

699
00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:52.380
<v Speaker 2>We have muscle farm that sponsors the </v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>

700
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:54.850
<v Speaker 2>They sell a ton of Shit and supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>help you recover.</v>

701
00:29:54.851 --> 00:29:56.650
<v Speaker 2>And protein powders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this jazz.</v>

702
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Think about creatine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

703
00:29:59.471 --> 00:30:01.900
<v Speaker 2>Clinically proven to enhance </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

704
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.390
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of stuff that you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's legal.</v>

705
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Even caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

706
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:10.620
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all stuff that gives you like a </v>

707
00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.571
<v Speaker 2>very slight bump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very slight edge and then taken all </v>

708
00:30:12.571 --> 00:30:15.661
<v Speaker 2>together synergistically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'll supplement like says your </v>

709
00:30:15.661 --> 00:30:16.270
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you have a,</v>

710
00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:21.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a diet where you're not getting enough </v>

711
00:30:21.271 --> 00:30:21.271
<v Speaker 2>stuff in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was just reading this,</v>

712
00:30:21.271 --> 00:30:24.331
<v Speaker 2>I posted something on facebook the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and people went crazy because I </v>

713
00:30:24.331 --> 00:30:26.761
<v Speaker 2>posted this thing about fish oil and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect that it's officially not being </v>

714
00:30:26.761 --> 00:30:27.040
<v Speaker 2>really scientifically proven.</v>

715
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:29.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you eat fish twice a week,</v>

716
00:30:29.321 --> 00:30:30.760
<v Speaker 2>then you don't need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

717
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:31.780
<v Speaker 2>and everybody goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

718
00:30:31.781 --> 00:30:32.590
<v Speaker 2>I need it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>

719
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:37.120
<v Speaker 2>people are convinced the supplement </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry is a $20 million up fish oil.</v>

720
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:39.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm convinced to that I need to have 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>pills a day.</v>

721
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:44.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a $24,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion dollar industry and people are </v>

722
00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:44.280
<v Speaker 2>convinced that they need these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

723
00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.360
<v Speaker 2>there's some science behind fish oil and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Krill oil though.</v>

724
00:30:46.361 --> 00:30:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Especially the anti inflammatory </v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

725
00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:50.380
<v Speaker 2>The inflammatory at a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At a high dose.</v>

726
00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

727
00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:52.710
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a lot official.</v>

728
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:57.780
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense for that for if you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to prevent heart disease and all </v>

729
00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 2>these things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying that,</v>

730
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:59.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's really.</v>

731
00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:04.140
<v Speaker 2>The link isn't there and if you eat </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatty fish you'll probably get enough in</v>

732
00:31:04.141 --> 00:31:07.720
<v Speaker 2>your diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really good fish like salmon that's high</v>

733
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:09.010
<v Speaker 2>in those healthy fats.</v>

734
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:09.750
<v Speaker 2>They're actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

735
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Everybody should eat that like once or </v>
<v Speaker 2>twice a week for Sushi.</v>

736
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I believe I,</v>

737
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:15.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll read,</v>

738
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll read all this shit about </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplements,</v>

739
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this stuff.</v>

740
00:31:18.941 --> 00:31:21.610
<v Speaker 2>I'll read like okay this doesn't work at</v>
<v Speaker 2>this barely works and whatever.</v>

741
00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:26.850
<v Speaker 2>And the next thing I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go open up my cabinet and I take 20 </v>

742
00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.060
<v Speaker 2>pills because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it doesn't fucking work,</v>

743
00:31:28.061 --> 00:31:33.061
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like that placebo effect is </v>

744
00:31:33.061 --> 00:31:33.061
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really strong and you know,</v>

745
00:31:33.061 --> 00:31:33.880
<v Speaker 2>certain things I take because I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

746
00:31:33.881 --> 00:31:35.340
<v Speaker 2>I heard this works for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

747
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Alpha lipoic acid when you eat carbs </v>
<v Speaker 2>that will help shuttle it in your </v>

748
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:40.380
<v Speaker 2>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will do.</v>

749
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:40.870
<v Speaker 2>I know that that even works like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

750
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Philip Polk assets supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>clinically proven,</v>

751
00:31:43.211 --> 00:31:48.211
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's studies on Alpha lipoic </v>

752
00:31:48.211 --> 00:31:48.670
<v Speaker 2>acid studies on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you get into like the whole thing,</v>

753
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.330
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

754
00:31:49.331 --> 00:31:50.260
<v Speaker 2>it's an antioxidant.</v>

755
00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:50.800
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

756
00:31:50.801 --> 00:31:52.540
<v Speaker 2>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck's an antioxidant?</v>

757
00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:54.010
<v Speaker 2>What do I need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do I need it?</v>

758
00:31:54.011 --> 00:31:54.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

759
00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:58.450
<v Speaker 2>you forget even why you needed to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain berries.</v>

760
00:31:58.451 --> 00:32:01.700
<v Speaker 2>They're like the best antioxidant and </v>
<v Speaker 2>birds and birds.</v>

761
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:06.720
<v Speaker 2>And then they find out there's studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>that say that eating antioxidants in </v>

762
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.991
<v Speaker 2>your diet doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't translate into antioxidants </v>

763
00:32:09.991 --> 00:32:11.830
<v Speaker 2>in the bloodstream and all this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

764
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:16.831
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta look at it like they say </v>
<v Speaker 2>you need certain precursors to be able </v>

765
00:32:16.831 --> 00:32:20.251
<v Speaker 2>to digest these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ice cream too fucking complicated.</v>

766
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.350
<v Speaker 2>You need to be your own doctor and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do your own research.</v>

767
00:32:23.351 --> 00:32:26.950
<v Speaker 2>I find I get big benefits when I eat a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of vegetables.</v>

768
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I feel a big benefit when I drink like </v>
<v Speaker 2>these Kale shakes the cow.</v>

769
00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.660
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought you were a tough guy.</v>

770
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:39.010
<v Speaker 2>It's healthy now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just makes fun of cattle.</v>

771
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>The time I was making fun of</v>

772
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:41.450
<v Speaker 1>one of my friends because he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

773
00:32:41.451 --> 00:32:43.940
<v Speaker 1>I went over here and I had a Kale Salad </v>
<v Speaker 1>is super skinny.</v>

774
00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:44.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

775
00:32:44.511 --> 00:32:45.760
<v Speaker 1>a Kale Salad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>

776
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:50.770
<v Speaker 1>just make up a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say That you had a fucking 20 ounce </v>

777
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:50.770
<v Speaker 1>ribeye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you could have both.</v>

778
00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I just think in general that's way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

779
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need,</v>

780
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:58.090
<v Speaker 1>we need vitamins and vitamins and </v>
<v Speaker 1>minerals and we need all these things in</v>

781
00:32:58.251 --> 00:33:03.251
<v Speaker 1>our diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so vegetables are probably the most </v>

782
00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:06.191
<v Speaker 1>abundant source of great nutrients in </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and fruits and things like </v>

783
00:33:06.191 --> 00:33:06.191
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

784
00:33:06.191 --> 00:33:07.870
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you eat them like it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

785
00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I feel different when I eat them when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have one of those Kale shakes with giant</v>

786
00:33:11.931 --> 00:33:16.931
<v Speaker 1>clumps of fucking ginger in it and four </v>
<v Speaker 1>cloves of garlic and an apple and </v>

787
00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:16.931
<v Speaker 1>celery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

788
00:33:16.931 --> 00:33:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Cucumber could feel like fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>superman.</v>

789
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.270
<v Speaker 1>You got to choke it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes like shit.</v>

790
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.180
<v Speaker 1>But when you choking it down once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you get it in,</v>

791
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.210
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoo,</v>

792
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.870
<v Speaker 1>you feel like you kinda like a double </v>
<v Speaker 1>shot of espresso,</v>

793
00:33:26.871 --> 00:33:28.400
<v Speaker 1>but you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel like jittery.</v>

794
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:31.490
<v Speaker 1>He just feel like crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember talking to you about.</v>

795
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

796
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:37.160
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of amazing and it was kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a good example for me talking to you </v>

797
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.840
<v Speaker 1>about like you were talking about going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the road and traveling and you said,</v>

798
00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to find a whole foods.</v>

799
00:33:40.881 --> 00:33:45.881
<v Speaker 1>I don't eat that process shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like to me that was like a real </v>

800
00:33:45.881 --> 00:33:48.701
<v Speaker 1>eyeopener to find that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somebody as busy as yourself goes </v>

801
00:33:48.701 --> 00:33:51.470
<v Speaker 1>out of their way to find like good </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy food and yeah.</v>

802
00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.480
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably more important almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>for him because he's on a plane or in a </v>

803
00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:56.480
<v Speaker 1>car or some shit all the time.</v>

804
00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.300
<v Speaker 1>It's just you can only go so many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always bring a vitamin packs of those </v>

805
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.680
<v Speaker 1>pure athlete packs I bring with me to </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement when I'm on the road,</v>

806
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I always make sure you get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>salads.</v>

807
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Like I get salads before every meal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I'm eating.</v>

808
00:34:08.841 --> 00:34:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I eat salads first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard.</v>

809
00:34:11.870 --> 00:34:13.240
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

810
00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.300
<v Speaker 1>food that's not just full of garbage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>contaminated.</v>

811
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:16.910
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

812
00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean like you go to subway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

813
00:34:18.561 --> 00:34:23.561
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get bread and there's an there and </v>

814
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:23.561
<v Speaker 1>you kind of can fill you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>

815
00:34:23.561 --> 00:34:27.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different preservatives and </v>

816
00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:27.620
<v Speaker 1>nonsense and process bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking kills your stomach.</v>

817
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.480
<v Speaker 1>All the gluten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

818
00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.800
<v Speaker 1>it's Chris's girlfriend eats tons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetables and Cece,</v>

819
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:36.600
<v Speaker 1>she's a super hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's the formula.</v>

820
00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can all be super hot chicks if Bruce </v>

821
00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Jenner had only known about the Kale </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salad,</v>

822
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:44.510
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the key,</v>

823
00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:45.560
<v Speaker 1>the key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

824
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:49.670
<v Speaker 1>is good nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good solid things in your diet.</v>

825
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I think when you're dealing with things </v>
<v Speaker 1>like UFC fighters,</v>

826
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:57.250
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with a level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance that they're requiring of </v>

827
00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.491
<v Speaker 1>their body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so extreme because even boxers </v>

828
00:35:00.491 --> 00:35:02.210
<v Speaker 1>like the average boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do their boxing workout.</v>

829
00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.240
<v Speaker 1>They'll spar a couple of times a week </v>
<v Speaker 1>depending upon the philosophy of the </v>

830
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:07.240
<v Speaker 1>camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the morning.</v>

831
00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.561
<v Speaker 1>They usually run like maybe they'll have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strength and conditioning session </v>

832
00:35:11.561 --> 00:35:12.410
<v Speaker 1>instead of a run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're doing two workouts a day and</v>

833
00:35:12.411 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 1>one of them is pretty mild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that big a deal,</v>

834
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.730
<v Speaker 1>so they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

835
00:35:16.731 --> 00:35:20.630
<v Speaker 1>they can get through six to eight week </v>
<v Speaker 1>camp and most likely they never pull out</v>

836
00:35:20.631 --> 00:35:25.631
<v Speaker 1>of fights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very rare that a championship </v>

837
00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:25.631
<v Speaker 1>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manny Pacquiao almost pulled out a floyd</v>

838
00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:27.760
<v Speaker 1>mayweather fight because he apparently </v>
<v Speaker 1>tours from,</v>

839
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:32.950
<v Speaker 1>but he wound up fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a lawsuit because we pushed </v>

840
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.950
<v Speaker 1>through the injury.</v>

841
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear about all that.</v>

842
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Different people are suing them because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they bet a lot of money on them.</v>

843
00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.790
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know that his right shoulder</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucked up and he had surgery right after</v>

844
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:43.791
<v Speaker 1>the fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the UFC fucking 20 percent of </v>

845
00:35:43.791 --> 00:35:46.890
<v Speaker 1>the fights fall apart at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guys fight injured all the time.</v>

846
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Even conor mcgregor when he fought </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Chad Mendez after,</v>

847
00:35:49.501 --> 00:35:52.440
<v Speaker 1>although pulled out a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mcgregor been getting stem cell shots in</v>

848
00:35:52.441 --> 00:35:54.090
<v Speaker 1>his knee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was fucked.</v>

849
00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was thinking he couldn't,</v>

850
00:35:55.291 --> 00:36:00.291
<v Speaker 1>he didn't wrestle the entire camp </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he was thinking there's no way </v>

851
00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:00.291
<v Speaker 1>because like I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll fall apart.</v>

852
00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Was a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grateful that was good.</v>

853
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.880
<v Speaker 1>It's to be the toughest sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

854
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people go like,</v>

855
00:36:04.501 --> 00:36:06.330
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball players are the best athletes</v>

856
00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:08.190
<v Speaker 1>or these guys are the best athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that,</v>

857
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:13.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of maybe genetically </v>

858
00:36:13.191 --> 00:36:13.191
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

859
00:36:13.191 --> 00:36:15.750
<v Speaker 1>but the amount of effort it takes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>step into the octagon,</v>

860
00:36:15.751 --> 00:36:17.370
<v Speaker 1>the amount of mental focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

861
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:18.510
<v Speaker 1>to me that's amazing.</v>

862
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree by it.</v>

863
00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Basketball I think has the best six foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>six athletes.</v>

864
00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well fighting is not made up.</v>

865
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.390
<v Speaker 1>It's something that is part of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else is made up.</v>

866
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:31.230
<v Speaker 1>Football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball,</v>

867
00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:32.340
<v Speaker 1>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made up,</v>

868
00:36:32.341 --> 00:36:33.000
<v Speaker 1>sports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

869
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:35.580
<v Speaker 1>when it came along we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the only sport.</v>

870
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:38.010
<v Speaker 1>To me that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really makes sense.</v>

871
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:43.011
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the movements and the art are all </v>

872
00:36:43.011 --> 00:36:45.051
<v Speaker 1>made up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had to figure out what's the most </v>

873
00:36:45.051 --> 00:36:45.770
<v Speaker 1>effective way of striking and I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to fuck someone up the fastest.</v>

874
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:50.430
<v Speaker 1>All of that is where the sport lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're right about the level</v>

875
00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:52.620
<v Speaker 1>of athlete when you see the guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>played for the NFL.</v>

876
00:36:52.621 --> 00:36:56.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean those are fucking super freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfuckers.</v>

877
00:36:56.281 --> 00:36:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Will you come in in the UFC soon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure.</v>

878
00:36:57.930 --> 00:36:59.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the money becomes right,</v>

879
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:00.570
<v Speaker 1>that's Jon Jones.</v>

880
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Jon Jones could have probably opted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go and play in the NFL.</v>

881
00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.160
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent.</v>

882
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.390
<v Speaker 1>His brothers both do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have.</v>

883
00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.150
<v Speaker 1>What's crazy is he's not even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>toughest one in his family.</v>

884
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Both his brothers said they kick his </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

885
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.140
<v Speaker 1>His younger brother and his older </v>
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>

886
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:17.550
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy fucked up family is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the guys got drafted.</v>

887
00:37:17.551 --> 00:37:22.551
<v Speaker 1>One of his brothers got drafted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him a thermal jumping on each </v>

888
00:37:22.551 --> 00:37:22.551
<v Speaker 1>other and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all kicking the shit out of each</v>

889
00:37:22.551 --> 00:37:22.551
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

890
00:37:22.551 --> 00:37:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of shit.</v>

891
00:37:23.611 --> 00:37:25.170
<v Speaker 1>Must've got broken in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

892
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why it happened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why he came out so bad ass and </v>

893
00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:31.380
<v Speaker 1>not afraid of anything about genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like that family,</v>

894
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:36.381
<v Speaker 1>the manning family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like because these families are just </v>

895
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:36.381
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

896
00:37:36.381 --> 00:37:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Genetics and that goes a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

897
00:37:37.111 --> 00:37:37.730
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

898
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.730
<v Speaker 1>Everything we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

899
00:37:38.731 --> 00:37:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Matt Hughes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a former UFC welterweight champion,</v>

900
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:42.690
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his twin,</v>

901
00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.910
<v Speaker 1>it looks exactly like them their entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

902
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:48.090
<v Speaker 1>They beat the fuck out of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course he gets to the UFC with his</v>

903
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:53.091
<v Speaker 1>fucking steely eyed gaze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's used to facing himself literally </v>

904
00:37:53.091 --> 00:37:55.800
<v Speaker 1>like a mirror version of him beating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck out of him his whole life.</v>

905
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Just smashing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>running through walls,</v>

906
00:37:58.921 --> 00:38:01.620
<v Speaker 1>like juggernaut summit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sparring partner.</v>

907
00:38:01.621 --> 00:38:03.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what I used to pick people up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>slam them.</v>

908
00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a.</v>

909
00:38:04.501 --> 00:38:06.140
<v Speaker 1>his brother's bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

910
00:38:06.141 --> 00:38:08.640
<v Speaker 1>His brothers to 65,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>

911
00:38:08.790 --> 00:38:10.620
<v Speaker 1>his brothers talking all kinds of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would,</v>

912
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would kick his brother's ass.</v>

913
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:15.210
<v Speaker 1>I think Jon Jones could probably get up </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that way.</v>

914
00:38:15.211 --> 00:38:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

915
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.060
<v Speaker 1>he's probably fighting this whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll.</v>

916
00:38:18.061 --> 00:38:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Chandler I think is a bigger guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's just an inch tall.</v>

917
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Two brothers in the NFL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

918
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arthur to his brother,</v>

919
00:38:23.011 --> 00:38:28.011
<v Speaker 1>arthur is even bigger than chandler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His brother Arthur is more than 300 </v>

920
00:38:28.011 --> 00:38:28.011
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

923
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:37.450
<v Speaker 1>it's taken a long time for the sport to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve to where it is.</v>

977
00:40:46.271 --> 00:40:48.550
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a boxing match.</v>

978
00:40:48.551 --> 00:40:49.630
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a boxer.</v>

979
00:40:49.631 --> 00:40:51.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure he would beat me in a boxing </v>
<v Speaker 1>match.</v>

980
00:40:51.381 --> 00:40:53.080
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't have matches.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

985
00:41:00.371 --> 00:41:02.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no way he's going to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what she's doing.</v>

986
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.570
<v Speaker 1>If he tied up with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really,</v>

987
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:06.490

<v Speaker 1>he'd have so much to think about it.</v>

988
00:41:06.491 --> 00:41:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she trained with guys all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

989
00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I've seen her but been there in the gym </v>

<v Speaker 2>what about steroids and that division </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the issue that I talk about Cyborg.</v>

1003

<v Speaker 2>You got guys like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you talk about it a lot in your </v>

1004
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:50.080
<v Speaker 2>podcasts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get into um,</v>

1005
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.770
<v Speaker 2>steroids here and there and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1006
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:56.830
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys don't eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't even look like they're doing </v>

1007
00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:56.830
<v Speaker 2>it like Gilbert Melendez or hoists </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gracie,</v>

1008
00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:57.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can't tell anymore.</v>

1009
00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>voice actually did look like he was </v>

1010
00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:03.090
<v Speaker 2>doing it when he got popped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you got pop.</v>

1011
00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:03.770
<v Speaker 2>We were there for that fight and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there with my friend Eddie,</v>

1012
00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Eddie Bravo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that he was like,</v>

1013
00:42:05.061 --> 00:42:10.061
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when is the last time you saw hoists </v>

1014
00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:11.711
<v Speaker 2>with traps traps?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was pretty jacked and is way </v>

1015
00:42:11.711 --> 00:42:12.260
<v Speaker 2>heavier than normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1016
00:42:12.261 --> 00:42:13.940
<v Speaker 2>he usually is around one 70 something.</v>

1017
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.940
<v Speaker 2>He was well over 200 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think because of the benefit of </v>

1018
00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:18.940
<v Speaker 2>steroids isn't just with weightlifting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like overall,</v>

1019
00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:23.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overall recovery overall energy and </v>

1020
00:42:23.921 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a cocktail.</v>

1021
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:28.070
<v Speaker 2>Probably a little growth hormone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little tests.</v>

1022
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.420
<v Speaker 2>Little Epo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1023
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.610
<v Speaker 2>a hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the a big thing too,</v>

1024
00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:36.710
<v Speaker 2>the vibrancy just having energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just having enthusiasm and they don't </v>

1025
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:38.560
<v Speaker 2>test for Hipo do they?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes they do.</v>

1026
00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:44.400
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] got popped for when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>fought against mighty mouse Johnson for </v>

1027
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.450
<v Speaker 2>the flyway title and he's still </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspended because the others.</v>

1028
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:49.100
<v Speaker 2>But there's guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I know that test is pretty.</v>

1029
00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little wishy washy.</v>

1030
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:52.100
<v Speaker 2>When we did bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

1031
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:54.620
<v Speaker 2>faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we looked heavily into the HIPO test and</v>

1032
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:56.900
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy that came up with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>definitive test,</v>

1033
00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:01.640
<v Speaker 2>a definitive like just either you're on </v>
<v Speaker 2>it or you're not a synthetically.</v>

1034
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.130
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1035
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.320
<v Speaker 2>he got a letter from the Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Committee saying from the US Olympic you</v>

1036
00:43:07.321 --> 00:43:10.790
<v Speaker 2>soc saying we can't use your test </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we'll be out.</v>

1037
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.030
<v Speaker 2>It's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1038
00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be,</v>

1039
00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:19.560
<v Speaker 2>it will be unfair to the Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the other foreign countries are </v>

1040
00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.560
<v Speaker 2>relying goosey tests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1041
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:25.820
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what they're saying is we're going to</v>

1042
00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:28.190
<v Speaker 2>have to allow a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating to when exactly.</v>

1043
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:29.130
<v Speaker 2>That's really what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1044
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.700
<v Speaker 2>we have to be able to cheat just as much</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the rest of them.</v>

1045
00:43:31.701 --> 00:43:32.650
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1046
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.820
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to do these testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 2>ratios,</v>

1047
00:43:34.850 --> 00:43:39.710
<v Speaker 2>like 99 point nine percent of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings should be at a one to one ratio.</v>

1048
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:40.760
<v Speaker 2>Epi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>

1049
00:43:40.761 --> 00:43:42.980
<v Speaker 2>the testosterone and kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

1050
00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:47.440
<v Speaker 2>they allow it to be like four to one or </v>
<v Speaker 2>six to six and now they'll have four.</v>

1051
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.510
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can take a little bit and be </v>

1052
00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:54.371
<v Speaker 2>under the radar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had guys pop it like 50 to one </v>

1053
00:43:54.371 --> 00:43:54.410
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I was doing.</v>

1054
00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:00.320
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like gorillas don't want to see a </v>

1055
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:04.940
<v Speaker 2>non tested UFC and have the guy's way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like over 300 pounds.</v>

1056
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:10.210
<v Speaker 2>They go one minute on and five minutes </v>
<v Speaker 2>off you go and just let him just kill </v>

1057
00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.890
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just fucking slug it out.</v>

1058
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I like the way you can't train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other thing you can't train </v>

1059
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:20.240
<v Speaker 2>for fighting because that's an unfair </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage to then you know,</v>

1060
00:44:20.241 --> 00:44:22.040
<v Speaker 2>how to fight and it ruins the fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1061
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 2>the other person's training too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not an unfair advantage.</v>

1062
00:44:24.471 --> 00:44:26.330
<v Speaker 2>So you can lift weights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about it.</v>

1063
00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:28.970
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that uh,</v>

1064
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:32.040
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a benefit to being a certain</v>

1065
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:37.040
<v Speaker 1>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a negative effect when you </v>

1066
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.471
<v Speaker 1>get over a certain weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think to 40 is around the right </v>

1067
00:44:39.471 --> 00:44:39.471
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a body weight,</v>

1068
00:44:39.471 --> 00:44:41.350
<v Speaker 1>well our body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

1069
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.340
<v Speaker 1>how lean you are is probably a big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big thing too.</v>

1070
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:49.341
<v Speaker 1>I think once you get under 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think is when you start to get in </v>

1071
00:44:49.341 --> 00:44:49.341
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're used to that,</v>

1072
00:44:49.341 --> 00:44:50.580
<v Speaker 1>unless your body's always under 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

1073
00:44:50.581 --> 00:44:52.710
<v Speaker 1>then you could probably operate at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

1074
00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.140
<v Speaker 1>at that being that lien for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1075
00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I just think if guys have good defensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>skills and they can avoid the bum rush </v>

1076
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.710
<v Speaker 1>for the first couple rounds guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like over to 40,</v>

1077
00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.930
<v Speaker 1>they have a real hard time getting into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the third,</v>

1078
00:45:03.931 --> 00:45:05.070
<v Speaker 1>fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and fifth rounds.</v>

1079
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just too much mass to carry around </v>
<v Speaker 1>two bones and the muscle and all the </v>

1080
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.500
<v Speaker 1>blood's being that big.</v>

1081
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oxygen requirements.</v>

1082
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:15.450
<v Speaker 1>So I think like a guy like Cain </v>
<v Speaker 1>Velasquez is always about to 40,</v>

1083
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.930
<v Speaker 1>known for a spectacular cardio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabrice overdo them,</v>

1084
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:21.030
<v Speaker 1>same thing somewhere in the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>

1085
00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:25.170
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was crazy.</v>

1086
00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Came fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Cain is known for his cardio,</v>

1087
00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:31.380
<v Speaker 1>so I think he just got a little cocky </v>
<v Speaker 1>and decided not to go to Mexico City,</v>

1088
00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.620
<v Speaker 1>but Mexico City is so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe how high it is.</v>

1089
00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:39.800
<v Speaker 1>7,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus feet above altitude or trouble </v>

1090
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.680
<v Speaker 1>breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I worked on the gym and a fucking </v>

1091
00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:42.680
<v Speaker 1>elliptical machine that was breathing </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy and it's almost like you can't be.</v>

1092
00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:45.240
<v Speaker 1>These guys are gonna fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for Breesa was real smart.</v>

1093
00:45:45.241 --> 00:45:50.241
<v Speaker 1>He moved to a place that's a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet above that for like a month and a </v>

1094
00:45:50.241 --> 00:45:55.220
<v Speaker 1>half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And cain was only there for two weeks </v>

1095
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:55.220
<v Speaker 1>and his improved all the ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1096
00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.160
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see a lot of time at Gold's gym.</v>

1097
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.090
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1098
00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.710
<v Speaker 1>he's improved vastly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1099
00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.180
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every step of the way,</v>

1100
00:46:00.181 --> 00:46:01.560
<v Speaker 1>which is nice to see too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1101
00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:06.561
<v Speaker 1>he was such a high level Jujitsu guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the best Jujitsu fighters </v>

1102
00:46:06.561 --> 00:46:07.620
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to get that good at Jujitsu you have</v>

1103
00:46:07.621 --> 00:46:12.621
<v Speaker 1>to have an intense mind for learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he just took that and applied it </v>

1104
00:46:12.621 --> 00:46:15.060
<v Speaker 1>to boxing and kickboxing and just once </v>
<v Speaker 1>he figured that out,</v>

1105
00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:20.340
<v Speaker 1>everybody was fucked because you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go to the ground without that </v>

1106
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:22.040
<v Speaker 1>beat some awesome fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eco,</v>

1107
00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:22.920
<v Speaker 1>the first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1108
00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:25.310
<v Speaker 1>He's the first guy to submit fader or </v>
<v Speaker 1>first got to submit cane,</v>

1109
00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:26.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1110
00:46:26.281 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty God damn spectacular </v>
<v Speaker 1>resume.</v>

1111
00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:34.080
<v Speaker 1>All he has to do is beat a few more guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he is arguably one of the greatest </v>

1112
00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:34.590
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not the greatest of all time share.</v>

1113
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:36.720
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that you bring up those</v>
<v Speaker 1>two fighters.</v>

1114
00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It makes me Kinda think like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a upper weight limit of muscle </v>

1115
00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.501
<v Speaker 1>mass that you can carry around because </v>
<v Speaker 1>like neither one of those guys is real </v>

1116
00:46:45.501 --> 00:46:48.171
<v Speaker 1>lean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe around the 200 pound mark is </v>

1117
00:46:48.171 --> 00:46:48.300
<v Speaker 1>probably almost like the cutoff if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start being more jacked than that,</v>

1118
00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe you can't sustain it for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>rounds.</v>

1119
00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a matter of durability.</v>

1120
00:46:52.621 --> 00:46:57.621
<v Speaker 1>Like you want to be big enough so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could take shots but you can't be </v>

1121
00:46:57.621 --> 00:46:58.510
<v Speaker 1>too big because you just can't carry it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into those.</v>

1122
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Especially a guy like Cain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although Coleman and occur,</v>

1123
00:47:02.701 --> 00:47:04.390
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of the exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were.</v>

1124
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:08.550
<v Speaker 1>They were on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bathtubs full of shit.</v>

1125
00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal,</v>

1126
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.940
<v Speaker 1>just an animal in such a freak of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

1127
00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:17.060
<v Speaker 1>I still maintain to this day that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody got a hold of Brock lesnar </v>

1128
00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:20.240
<v Speaker 1>early on and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to me and you can be the best </v>

1129
00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 1>heavyweight fighter ever like a for us </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a hobby or a matt hume,</v>

1130
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:27.390
<v Speaker 1>like someone who's a real expert in mma </v>
<v Speaker 1>who barack listened to and just said,</v>

1131
00:47:27.391 --> 00:47:28.570
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this we're going to do first.</v>

1132
00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.680
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we're going to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to nothing but striking for </v>

1133
00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.420
<v Speaker 1>like a couple of years and you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get hit.</v>

1134
00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't want you to develop any bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>habits and you're not hitting anybody </v>

1135
00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:42.211
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you're gonna do is you're going to </v>

1136
00:47:42.211 --> 00:47:42.211
<v Speaker 1>do movement with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to hit you.</v>

1137
00:47:42.211 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Get to do pad work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to do technique work and </v>

1138
00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:47.410
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have that shit built into</v>
<v Speaker 1>your your neurons and we're gonna.</v>

1139
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.390
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all these movements.</v>

1140
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:54.510
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be a part of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural movement and if you're willing </v>

1141
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:57.181
<v Speaker 1>to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to develop a base and that </v>

1142
00:47:57.181 --> 00:47:59.521
<v Speaker 1>base will translate into success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but otherwise you're going to be scared </v>

1143
00:47:59.521 --> 00:48:01.000
<v Speaker 1>of getting hit and that's what his </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem always was.</v>

1144
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:06.120
<v Speaker 1>He would always get tagged by like </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Shane car or more Alistair </v>

1145
00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.720
<v Speaker 1>overeem and you could see just he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have enough time in there.</v>

1146
00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.750
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't like it either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1147
00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.440
<v Speaker 1>You got to spar with guys who barely </v>
<v Speaker 1>touch.</v>

1148
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:16.441
<v Speaker 1>You were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not hurting you and you don't </v>

1149
00:48:16.441 --> 00:48:16.441
<v Speaker 1>hurt them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's in the beginning.</v>

1150
00:48:16.441 --> 00:48:18.040
<v Speaker 1>That's like the most critical because </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're gonna,</v>

1151
00:48:18.041 --> 00:48:23.041
<v Speaker 1>miss giant chunks of the development </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you just get a fucking swearing </v>

1152
00:48:23.041 --> 00:48:27.380
<v Speaker 1>piece that he was able to get to where </v>
<v Speaker 1>he did during all those years of wwe </v>

1153
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:28.530
<v Speaker 1>first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1154
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 1>like just fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if he just went on?</v>

1155
00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:32.110
<v Speaker 1>If we adjust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

1156
00:48:32.111 --> 00:48:33.430
<v Speaker 1>gone straight in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1157
00:48:33.431 --> 00:48:38.431
<v Speaker 1>he would have been the best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was still a heavyweight champion </v>

1158
00:48:38.431 --> 00:48:40.391
<v Speaker 1>of the fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knocked out randy coture beat the shit </v>

1159
00:48:40.391 --> 00:48:41.140
<v Speaker 1>out of Frank Mir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a stud.</v>

1160
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.010
<v Speaker 1>I love watching him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just had to.</v>

1161
00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of bummed but happy when he </v>

1162
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.540
<v Speaker 1>decided to quit mma recently had a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a moment where it's was trying to</v>

1163
00:48:49.541 --> 00:48:54.541
<v Speaker 1>figure out whether it's going to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>going the wwe or give one more shot at </v>

1164
00:48:54.541 --> 00:48:55.720
<v Speaker 1>the UFC and I know he talked to Dana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he talked to the UFC.</v>

1165
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:59.020
<v Speaker 1>He was really thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately you don't want to see him</v>

1166
00:48:59.021 --> 00:49:01.930
<v Speaker 1>go down a bad path of like being the guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets,</v>

1167
00:49:01.931 --> 00:49:03.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concussion is.</v>

1168
00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a big one who's worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about posting concussion syndrome?</v>

1169
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Like Joseph Valtellina use the glory </v>
<v Speaker 1>welterweight champion.</v>

1170
00:49:10.181 --> 00:49:13.060
<v Speaker 1>He just stepped down and relinquish his </v>
<v Speaker 1>title because of concussions,</v>

1171
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:16.390
<v Speaker 1>like concussions in MMA or a big fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

1172
00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.700
<v Speaker 1>And you don't hear about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you feel about like,</v>

1173
00:49:18.701 --> 00:49:20.240
<v Speaker 1>I watch a lot of fights where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1174
00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.530
<v Speaker 1>we want to see him go on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want to see your health.</v>

1175
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Some guys will get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't stop it,</v>

1176
00:49:25.391 --> 00:49:28.120
<v Speaker 1>don't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get pounded and come back.</v>

1177
00:49:28.121 --> 00:49:29.770
<v Speaker 1>And they come right back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

1178
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:31.510
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing they didn't call it,</v>

1179
00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:32.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great job,</v>

1180
00:49:32.801 --> 00:49:37.801
<v Speaker 1>Herb Dean or whoever the ref is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then other times guys get pounded </v>

1181
00:49:37.801 --> 00:49:41.190
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get pounded 10 times in a row and </v>

1182
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.190
<v Speaker 1>then they're out.</v>

1183
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.190
<v Speaker 1>And then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1184
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:42.590
<v Speaker 1>they didn't need the 10 shots to be out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1185
00:49:42.591 --> 00:49:45.160
<v Speaker 1>it's why the fight is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

1186
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I always root for the guy to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after the fights over,</v>

1187
00:49:49.091 --> 00:49:52.120
<v Speaker 1>like if I'm analyzing it from a rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint,</v>

1188
00:49:52.121 --> 00:49:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1189
00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.520
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is in trouble.</v>

1190
00:49:54.521 --> 00:49:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1191
00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good at your ring side.</v>

1192
00:49:57.491 --> 00:50:02.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be a little scary at times when </v>

1193
00:50:02.491 --> 00:50:02.491
<v Speaker 1>people are blasted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1194
00:50:02.491 --> 00:50:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Some of the knockouts are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been some knockouts.</v>

1195
00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:05.230
<v Speaker 1>We'd probably see the eyes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

1196
00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:06.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1197
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:11.670
<v Speaker 1>How did you get into that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like where you were you fighting before </v>

1198
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:13.960
<v Speaker 1>way before your wedding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way before you had a really big interest</v>

1199
00:50:13.961 --> 00:50:14.980
<v Speaker 1>in it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1200
00:50:15.010 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 1>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1201
00:50:15.611 --> 00:50:20.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had stopped competing in like 1988.</v>

1202
00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:25.290
<v Speaker 1>That's when I got into comedy and maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>89 was probably like my last kickboxing </v>

1203
00:50:25.290 --> 00:50:29.971
<v Speaker 1>fights and then I went into standup and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then I just trained recreationally until</v>

1204
00:50:30.501 --> 00:50:31.550
<v Speaker 1>like around [inaudible] 93.</v>

1205
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:33.730
<v Speaker 1>The UFC came around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I saw the first,</v>

1206
00:50:33.731 --> 00:50:38.731
<v Speaker 1>a tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a tape of it at 94 and then I was </v>

1207
00:50:38.731 --> 00:50:38.731
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1208
00:50:38.731 --> 00:50:40.970
<v Speaker 1>what does this Jujitsu style?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were there from day one to it.</v>

1209
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I watched that first paper view live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember that like crazy to wanting to</v>

1210
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.490
<v Speaker 1>get a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw it on tape.</v>

1211
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Someone talked about it at the gym and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>

1212
00:50:48.210 --> 00:50:50.370
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They you believe it,</v>

1213
00:50:50.371 --> 00:50:53.300
<v Speaker 1>it's like a dream come true for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a commercial floor.</v>

1214
00:50:53.301 --> 00:50:54.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

1215
00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.760
<v Speaker 1>That was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back in the day.</v>

1216
00:50:55.790 --> 00:51:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And remember it used to be in the faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>of death section of the videos are for </v>

1217
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:03.260
<v Speaker 1>like a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went completely away.</v>

1218
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:05.990
<v Speaker 1>Well that's when I came in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came in while I was banned.</v>

1219
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I started working in [inaudible] 97.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started doing the post fight </v>

1220
00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:12.440
<v Speaker 1>interviews and 97 while I was a sitcom.</v>

1221
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.420
<v Speaker 1>These radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go on the weekends,</v>

1222
00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:16.370
<v Speaker 1>fly off the fucking bum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1223
00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:20.390
<v Speaker 1>Alabama is a great book of blood in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage that outlines all that stuff and it</v>

1224
00:51:20.391 --> 00:51:25.391
<v Speaker 1>outlines like how a Dane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got into it and they went to an event </v>

1225
00:51:25.391 --> 00:51:25.391
<v Speaker 1>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just sucks.</v>

1226
00:51:25.391 --> 00:51:27.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't even sell tee shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what's going on.</v>

1227
00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:28.850
<v Speaker 1>We need to like take this over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1228
00:51:28.851 --> 00:51:30.170
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool.</v>

1229
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They bought it in 2001 I think.</v>

1230
00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:38.530
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came in in 2002 and started doing the </v>

1231
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.471
<v Speaker 1>commentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember it when it got in trouble </v>

1232
00:51:41.471 --> 00:51:41.471
<v Speaker 1>before the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1233
00:51:41.471 --> 00:51:45.070
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually worked for wwe and Vince </v>

1234
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Mcmahon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being in limbo of Vince </v>

1235
00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Mcmahon being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1236
00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:50.320
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're trying to sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should buy it.</v>

1237
00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.600
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

1238
00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1239
00:51:52.290 --> 00:51:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And then two years later they tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unsuccessfully start some sort of a.</v>

1240
00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:58.900
<v Speaker 1>and I may think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think Vince has been amended.</v>

1241
00:51:59.420 --> 00:51:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1242
00:51:59.961 --> 00:52:00.950
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would try to,</v>

1243
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.480
<v Speaker 1>they never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never got off the ground.</v>

1244
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:04.300
<v Speaker 1>They were planning on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1245
00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:07.730
<v Speaker 1>What happened though was Vince and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a legitimate concern is like,</v>

1246
00:52:07.731 --> 00:52:09.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take the legitimacy out of it.</v>

1247
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:11.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if he owned something like that,</v>

1248
00:52:11.051 --> 00:52:12.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might think it's fixed.</v>

1249
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1250
00:52:13.071 --> 00:52:15.680
<v Speaker 1>they didn't think that about the XFL,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1251
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Guess not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1252
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real problem is the talent </v>

1253
00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:24.071
<v Speaker 1>pool know there's not that many good </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters in the UFC owns the contracts </v>

1254
00:52:24.071 --> 00:52:24.950
<v Speaker 1>for 500 fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1255
00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.300
<v Speaker 1>And they're all the best fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1256
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:31.390
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not one fighter in any weight </v>

1257
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.390
<v Speaker 1>class outside of the UFC that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a rational argument that's the best</v>

1258
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:32.390
<v Speaker 1>fighter in that weight class.</v>

1259
00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:34.970
<v Speaker 1>So once they have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1260
00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:37.470
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to sell a league when you know</v>

1261
00:52:37.471 --> 00:52:40.910
<v Speaker 1>that the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is our 170 pound world champion.</v>

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1263
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:46.930

<v Speaker 1>it's hard for me.</v>

1266
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:49.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>them to build stars to build like a.</v>

1270
00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:07.290

<v Speaker 1>so they're always going to recruit the </v>

1277
00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:20.051
<v Speaker 1>best guys.</v>

1278
00:53:20.051 --> 00:53:20.750
<v Speaker 1>They're ahead of the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1279
00:53:20.751 --> 00:53:25.751

<v Speaker 1>especially like if like Bella tour </v>

<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's all like the same with </v>

1282
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:32.990
<v Speaker 1>wrestling now if you look at wwe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been,</v>

1283
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:37.370
<v Speaker 1>they've had a monopoly for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then wcw came along and they started </v>

1284
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.780
<v Speaker 1>getting popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you know,</v>

1285
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.850
<v Speaker 1>now that the web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legs,</v>

1286
00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:41.990
<v Speaker 1>the other league TNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so lame,</v>

1287
00:53:41.991 --> 00:53:42.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

1288
00:53:42.361 --> 00:53:47.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody really gives a fuck about it at </v>

1289
00:53:47.361 --> 00:53:47.860
<v Speaker 1>all and that's the thing is like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end like UFC will be,</v>

1290
00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:49.500
<v Speaker 1>it will be around forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the NFL,</v>

1291
00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:50.520
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they sell it,</v>

1292
00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:51.190
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could,</v>

1293
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:52.560
<v Speaker 1>they could get to a point where they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1294
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:53.990
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get the fuck out of here.</v>

1295
00:53:54.200 --> 00:53:56.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work killing us.</v>

1296
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Because Dana works all day long every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1297
00:53:59.310 --> 00:54:04.310
<v Speaker 1>He's constantly flying all over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and Lorenzo's doing the same </v>

1298
00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:04.310
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1299
00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:08.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy doing what those guys are </v>

1300
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.091
<v Speaker 1>doing and when they're gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's gonna miss him and people </v>

1301
00:54:11.091 --> 00:54:13.731
<v Speaker 1>complaining about the EOC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when they're gone you realize the </v>

1302
00:54:13.731 --> 00:54:13.890
<v Speaker 1>alternative and if they've created an </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

1303
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.230
<v Speaker 1>people are mad about a stupid uniforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1304
00:54:16.231 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 1>that's the last thing I'd get mad about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1305
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have some points fighter side when </v>

1306
00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:25.440
<v Speaker 1>it comes to that with the sponsorships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just they lose too much money,</v>

1307
00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:26.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>

1308
00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:31.340
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky enough to get in on the </v>

1309
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:31.340
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1310
00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:31.920
<v Speaker 1>the last thing before a reebok took over</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1311
00:54:31.921 --> 00:54:36.921
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one of the fighters and was pretty </v>

1312
00:54:36.921 --> 00:54:39.051
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's cool to see the logo up there and </v>

1313
00:54:39.051 --> 00:54:39.051
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was nice people.</v>

1314
00:54:39.051 --> 00:54:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a big part of what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighters get.</v>

1315
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:41.670
<v Speaker 1>It's what you would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like ego sponsorships,</v>

1316
00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.220
<v Speaker 1>like dynamic fastener is on like so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many.</v>

1317
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:49.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's on so many different tee </v>

1318
00:54:49.300 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 1>shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many that'll reebok said the there.</v>

1319
00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:55.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like I'm over the spread over </v>

1320
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.010
<v Speaker 1>all the fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll make more money.</v>

1321
00:54:56.011 --> 00:54:58.140
<v Speaker 1>The younger fighters or is that just not</v>
<v Speaker 1>true?</v>

1322
00:54:58.590 --> 00:54:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1323
00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's true.</v>

1324
00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe for deal changes or they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to make more money and you know,</v>

1325
00:55:05.721 --> 00:55:07.590
<v Speaker 1>it becomes something bigger than what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is right now.</v>

1326
00:55:07.591 --> 00:55:10.500
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tim Kennedy said it best reasonably.</v>

1327
00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:14.520
<v Speaker 1>He said on one strikeforce card he made </v>
<v Speaker 1>more money in sponsorships.</v>

1328
00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Then the reebok paid out for the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>last UFC car from Brazil.</v>

1329
00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:19.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

1330
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all those people were wearing reebok </v>

1331
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 1>gear.</v>

1332
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.870
<v Speaker 1>He made more money from one fight in </v>
<v Speaker 1>strikeforce.</v>

1333
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>

1334
00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like reebok had a pretty good </v>

1335
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:32.050
<v Speaker 1>deal from what I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's a good deal.</v>

1336
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:32.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1337
00:55:32.050 --> 00:55:32.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean for Reebok,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

1338
00:55:32.941 --> 00:55:37.941
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's ideal for Reebok </v>
<v Speaker 1>because what I'm saying because I think </v>

1339
00:55:37.941 --> 00:55:38.160
<v Speaker 1>it gives them a bad name in some ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1340
00:55:38.161 --> 00:55:43.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand all these people come out </v>

1341
00:55:43.161 --> 00:55:43.161
<v Speaker 1>and whereas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1342
00:55:43.161 --> 00:55:43.161
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1343
00:55:43.161 --> 00:55:43.161
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1344
00:55:43.161 --> 00:55:47.151
<v Speaker 1>that's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all these people are complaining </v>

1345
00:55:47.151 --> 00:55:48.060
<v Speaker 1>like Tim Kennedy complaints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>titch Dorian complainants who gets fired</v>

1346
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.850
<v Speaker 1>for are complaining lots of fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a complainant,</v>

1347
00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:55.851
<v Speaker 1>Brendan sharp complaint or all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different guys complained that that's </v>

1348
00:55:55.851 --> 00:55:57.060
<v Speaker 1>all negative press towards their brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1349
00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:59.360
<v Speaker 1>they're not a person right there a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand.</v>

1350
00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:04.510
<v Speaker 1>If you associate that brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't like fire the head guy and </v>

1351
00:56:04.510 --> 00:56:04.510
<v Speaker 1>change the brand.</v>

1352
00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:06.180
<v Speaker 1>The brand is still the brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1353
00:56:06.181 --> 00:56:08.010
<v Speaker 1>when everybody's gonna associate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand with it.</v>

1354
00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Is it a big name brand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1355
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:14.900
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see a big name brand attached to a </v>

1356
00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:14.900
<v Speaker 1>sport like the UFC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely,</v>

1357
00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:19.760
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like whenever you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where the fighters are going </v>

1358
00:56:20.391 --> 00:56:25.391
<v Speaker 1>to lose money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's always the number one concern </v>

1359
00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:28.381
<v Speaker 1>that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows the window of </v>

1360
00:56:28.381 --> 00:56:28.381
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for a fighter is extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

1361
00:56:28.381 --> 00:56:28.690
<v Speaker 1>so you have a few years to make some </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

1362
00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:30.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you take some of that money away</v>

1363
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:34.780
<v Speaker 1>from them in terms in favor of prestige,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prestige,</v>

1364
00:56:34.781 --> 00:56:36.420
<v Speaker 1>which is inarguable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reebok's,</v>

1365
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:41.490
<v Speaker 1>a huge brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great to be in business with a big </v>

1366
00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:41.490
<v Speaker 1>brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it costs fighters money,</v>

1367
00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:44.110
<v Speaker 1>boy that's going to be hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't not see that.</v>

1368
00:56:44.111 --> 00:56:46.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're going to put </v>
<v Speaker 1>blinders on and ignore that.</v>

1369
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:48.550
<v Speaker 1>You have to address that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social media is a huge thing.</v>

1370
00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:50.770
<v Speaker 1>So the fighters are going to be heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new just.</v>

1371
00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:53.410
<v Speaker 1>It's the big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bigger than anything because if you</v>

1372
00:56:53.411 --> 00:56:55.780
<v Speaker 1>bitch about something on twitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone says,</v>

1373
00:56:55.781 --> 00:57:00.781
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris Bell just went off about that and </v>

1374
00:57:00.781 --> 00:57:00.910
<v Speaker 1>then some newspaper gets ahold of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then boom,</v>

1375
00:57:00.911 --> 00:57:05.911
<v Speaker 1>it goes viral on facebook and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>repost it and tweet it because we live </v>

1376
00:57:05.911 --> 00:57:09.811
<v Speaker 1>in a different world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anytime someone like stitch gets </v>

1377
00:57:09.811 --> 00:57:09.811
<v Speaker 1>fired because he said something about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1378
00:57:09.811 --> 00:57:11.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reebok of this deal kind of sucks for me</v>

1379
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:12.700
<v Speaker 1>because now I'm not making as much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

1380
00:57:12.850 --> 00:57:14.410
<v Speaker 1>So they fire them and then all of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>

1381
00:57:14.411 --> 00:57:19.411
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes a way bigger issue than it </v>

1382
00:57:19.411 --> 00:57:21.190
<v Speaker 1>was just with them saying that if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>just said that and that was it,</v>

1383
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:22.570
<v Speaker 1>it would have been a small issue.</v>

1384
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:25.240
<v Speaker 1>But him saying that and then getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>fired for it,</v>

1385
00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 1>it compounds the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People react quickly to social media,</v>

1386
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:31.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes everything go faster.</v>

1387
00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:33.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start wearing Nike's history.</v>

1388
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:36.610
<v Speaker 1>This is what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a business person.</v>

1389
00:57:36.611 --> 00:57:37.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

1390
00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:41.080
<v Speaker 1>if I was running the UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would've been bankrupt a long fucking</v>

1391
00:57:41.081 --> 00:57:42.810
<v Speaker 1>time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>

1392
00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

1393
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:46.600
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real dangerous.</v>

1394
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.700
<v Speaker 1>Looking at the bright side of deals like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1395
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:50.410
<v Speaker 1>like let's look at the bright side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

1396
00:57:50.411 --> 00:57:53.980
<v Speaker 1>let's look at the worst case scenario.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the worst case scenario?</v>

1397
00:57:53.981 --> 00:57:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is going to hate reebok.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the worst case scenario.</v>

1398
00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.780
<v Speaker 1>People gonna be mad at the UFC and mad </v>

1407
00:58:18.721 --> 00:58:23.281
<v Speaker 1>that you slide up to your biceps and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually gives you a bit of an </v>

1408
00:58:23.281 --> 00:58:24.520
<v Speaker 1>assistance when doing pushups or bench </v>
<v Speaker 1>press or something like that.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm five.</v>

1416
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:39.190
<v Speaker 1>My best bench press and competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where the bench shirt,</v>

1417
00:58:39.191 --> 00:58:42.230
<v Speaker 1>which is much more heavy duty than than </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like the slingshot.</v>

1418
00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.920
<v Speaker 1>It's just a supportive device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy looking.</v>

1419
00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:50.220
<v Speaker 1>Looks like a straight jacket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I did an 854 pound bench press in </v>

1420
00:58:50.231 --> 00:58:52.040
<v Speaker 1>the 275 pound weight class.</v>

1421
00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:57.040
<v Speaker 1>So then without a bench shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my best bench press is 560 pounds in </v>

1422
00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:57.310
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much do those weigh?</v>

1424
00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Those weigh like 800 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

1425
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:02.380
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>

1426
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:07.381
<v Speaker 1>Wait Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long have been at it for a long </v>

1427
00:59:07.381 --> 00:59:07.381
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started when I was 12,</v>

1428
00:59:07.381 --> 00:59:11.040
<v Speaker 1>two older brothers that are dicks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced me to lift weights even though I </v>

1429
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.360
<v Speaker 1>was and I didn't fucking want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are those bench shirts?</v>

1430
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Those vests?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1431
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Bencher wearing a denim jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Backwards is what it's like and </v>

1432
00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:22.010
<v Speaker 1>originally it was originally it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed just</v>

1433
00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.020
<v Speaker 3>to be protective and then people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1434
00:59:24.021 --> 00:59:25.640
<v Speaker 3>wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only is it protective,</v>

1435
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:30.641
<v Speaker 3>but I can lift more weight with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so then they started making them </v>

1436
00:59:30.641 --> 00:59:31.220
<v Speaker 3>more and more extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They used to be like one layer.</v>

1437
00:59:31.221 --> 00:59:36.221
<v Speaker 3>Then they started making two layers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they started making them out of a pair </v>

1438
00:59:36.221 --> 00:59:38.681
<v Speaker 3>of fucking genes and they started making</v>
<v Speaker 3>them out of a canvas and all kinds of </v>

1439
00:59:38.681 --> 00:59:41.600
<v Speaker 3>different where people revolted against </v>
<v Speaker 3>that and now everybody lifts.</v>

1440
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:45.380
<v Speaker 3>Ra are a lot of people lift robin,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could say,</v>

1441
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:46.520
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much do you bench?</v>

1442
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.040
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fine.</v>

1443
00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:49.200
<v Speaker 3>And raw would just be with just race </v>
<v Speaker 3>ramps on.</v>

1444
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:50.390
<v Speaker 3>What did you do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Five.</v>

1445
00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Five slash 65 slash 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

1446
00:59:52.551 --> 00:59:54.770
<v Speaker 3>You can do 300 pounds more than one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those shirts.</v>

1447
00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that nuts?</v>

1448
00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:00.760

<v Speaker 3>like a thousand pounds to 180 squat.</v>

1449
01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:04.040
<v Speaker 3>And fell pretty bad with 185.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He fell.</v>

1450
01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:05.540
<v Speaker 3>I fucking felt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1451
01:00:05.541 --> 01:00:08.280
<v Speaker 3>what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there's a girl that's a,</v>

1452
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.570
<v Speaker 3>was trained under Jim and she's running,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's running the squat rack.</v>

1453
01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 3>The squat rack is called a monolift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1454
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:15.560
<v Speaker 3>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1455
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:19.340
<v Speaker 3>you released this like lever so that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't have to walk the weight backwards,</v>

1456
01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:20.440
<v Speaker 3>you understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1457
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:25.710
<v Speaker 3>Another walked away backwards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the lever moves out of the way and I </v>

1458
01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:28.871
<v Speaker 3>pick the weight up and go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is the girl's hot and she's </v>

1459
01:00:28.871 --> 01:00:32.231
<v Speaker 3>in a sundress and I'm trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to concentrate on a lift </v>

1460
01:00:32.231 --> 01:00:32.570
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so midway down on the squat,</v>

1461
01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.720
<v Speaker 3>one nice shoots out to left the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>new shoots out the other way.</v>

1462
01:00:35.721 --> 01:00:38.030
<v Speaker 3>And next thing I know is on the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>ground.</v>

1463
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.940
<v Speaker 3>So it was it on your back or in front of</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and now I.</v>

1464
01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:44.510
<v Speaker 3>well luckily I got kind of unloaded from</v>
<v Speaker 3>the weight quickly it,</v>

1465
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:46.490
<v Speaker 3>it fell back behind me and I fell </v>
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

1466
01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:49.340
<v Speaker 3>I was fucked up for months from that.</v>

1509
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.500
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of just part of the territory </v>

1550
01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:55.311
<v Speaker 3>wider.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It creates some tightness around the </v>

1551
01:03:55.311 --> 01:03:58.491
<v Speaker 3>hips and kind of gives you some support </v>
<v Speaker 3>through your hips because pretty hot to </v>

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1563
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:25.410
<v Speaker 3>when it happened and I felt it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't,</v>

1564
01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:31.040
<v Speaker 3>it didn't hurt that bad initially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but then as time wore on it got worse </v>

1565
01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.421
<v Speaker 3>and worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The swelling to start getting fucking </v>

1566
01:04:35.421 --> 01:04:37.281
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stayed at the competition and I'm a </v>

1567
01:04:37.281 --> 01:04:38.640
<v Speaker 3>coach for all the athletes that are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that video basically.</v>

1568
01:04:38.641 --> 01:04:41.700
<v Speaker 3>And I stayed the whole time and helped </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody and just like I normally would</v>

1569
01:04:41.790 --> 01:04:44.490
<v Speaker 3>normally do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the next day when I woke up,</v>

1570
01:04:44.491 --> 01:04:45.540
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't,</v>

1571
01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.700
<v Speaker 3>by the time I got home even I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even,</v>

1572
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:50.070
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even get upstairs to go to </v>
<v Speaker 3>bed.</v>

1573
01:04:50.071 --> 01:04:54.060
<v Speaker 3>I just fucking sat on the couch and sat </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the chair and just slept in the chair</v>

1574
01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:57.000
<v Speaker 3>for the night and slept right there for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next two or three days.</v>

1575
01:04:57.270 --> 01:05:02.270
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the interesting aspects of your </v>

1576
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.270
<v Speaker 3>film was Louie Simmons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>

1577
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.730
<v Speaker 3>Greg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have one of his,</v>

1578
01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:04.950
<v Speaker 3>a reverse hypers and the back things are</v>
<v Speaker 3>awesome.</v>

1579
01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Credible machine for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for decompressing your lower back and </v>

1580
01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.170
<v Speaker 3>pumping blood into it and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1581
01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:14.470
<v Speaker 3>things amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's a refreshing character to,</v>

1582
01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was funny when you were saying that </v>

1583
01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:19.800
<v Speaker 3>you were going to get off steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1584
01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:19.950
<v Speaker 3>we'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1585
01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:22.680
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's,</v>

1586
01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:24.670
<v Speaker 3>that's the attitude that all those guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

1587
01:05:24.671 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1588
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 3>you just have to accept the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you are now a steroid dude.</v>

1589
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:29.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely.</v>

1590
01:05:29.101 --> 01:05:30.010
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

1591
01:05:30.011 --> 01:05:33.550
<v Speaker 3>making a good documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a lot about casting.</v>

1592
01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.630
<v Speaker 3>It's about them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You pick,</v>

1593
01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:39.690
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just like any other movie who you </v>

1594
01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:42.091
<v Speaker 3>picked to be in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Louie Simmons was somebody that </v>

1595
01:05:42.091 --> 01:05:43.510
<v Speaker 3>inspired me to do things differently to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think differently.</v>

1596
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:46.150
<v Speaker 3>Used chains and bands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to go into Gold's gym,</v>

1597
01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:47.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15,</v>

1598
01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:52.120
<v Speaker 3>20 minute pioneer that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bands and chains and all that type of </v>

1599
01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:52.200
<v Speaker 3>change on the bar to accommodate </v>
<v Speaker 3>assistant.</v>

1600
01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.940
<v Speaker 3>So like the band will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1601
01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.560
<v Speaker 3>you can tell him it's getting harder as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you get higher,</v>

1602
01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.980
<v Speaker 3>as you squat is called good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's called accommodating resistance.</v>

1603
01:05:59.981 --> 01:06:02.890
<v Speaker 3>It basically makes you a drive into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bar faster.</v>

1604
01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:05.410
<v Speaker 3>So if you can picture a bunch of chains </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the bar,</v>

1605
01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:10.411
<v Speaker 3>there's um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say 40 pounds of chains on the </v>

1606
01:06:10.411 --> 01:06:12.841
<v Speaker 3>bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you lower those weights will be less </v>

1607
01:06:12.841 --> 01:06:13.190
<v Speaker 3>and less weight on the bar and as you go</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pick it back up,</v>

1608
01:06:13.191 --> 01:06:14.640
<v Speaker 3>it will be more and more weight on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bar scene.</v>

1609
01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.440
<v Speaker 3>You have to actually physically move </v>
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>

1610
01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:22.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm a way that I try to explain it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>people as if you were to try to hop up </v>

1611
01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:22.560
<v Speaker 3>on this podcast table.</v>

1612
01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:27.270
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we trained with bands and change a </v>

1613
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:27.270
<v Speaker 3>similar thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to do it quickly,</v>

1614
01:06:27.270 --> 01:06:29.230
<v Speaker 3>you have to try to get a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>acceleration into it.</v>

1615
01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:34.560
<v Speaker 3>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that would probably eight and </v>

1616
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:34.560
<v Speaker 3>explosive shit like football or punching</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1617
01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:39.260
<v Speaker 3>And then also the also a huge benefit of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is that the weight is lighter at the </v>

1618
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:43.021
<v Speaker 3>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same thing kind of happens with the </v>

1619
01:06:43.021 --> 01:06:43.021
<v Speaker 3>slingshot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with the weight being lighter at the</v>

1620
01:06:43.021 --> 01:06:43.021
<v Speaker 3>bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1621
01:06:43.021 --> 01:06:43.021
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1622
01:06:43.021 --> 01:06:47.820
<v Speaker 3>creates a safer environment because the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bottom of a squat and the bottom of </v>

1623
01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:49.060
<v Speaker 3>bench presser kind of somewhat dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 3>positions to be in.</v>

1624
01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:52.510
<v Speaker 3>How much does it chain way normally they</v>
<v Speaker 3>usually wait about 20 pounds.</v>

1625
01:06:52.511 --> 01:06:55.660
<v Speaker 3>The ones that we use pretty pretty God </v>
<v Speaker 3>damn thick.</v>

1626
01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like big ass chains in the seventies </v>

1627
01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.830
<v Speaker 3>boating type of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The thing is I would read a magazine </v>

1628
01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:03.830
<v Speaker 3>called power lifting USA.</v>

1629
01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:08.100
<v Speaker 3>We didn't have the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh I thought you were going to say </v>

1630
01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:08.330
<v Speaker 3>inches inches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell talking about that.</v>

1631
01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:11.500
<v Speaker 3>And so action.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we used to look at that,</v>

1632
01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:12.670
<v Speaker 3>that magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was the only,</v>

1633
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:16.900
<v Speaker 3>only information on strength training </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the entire world that a kid,</v>

1634
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:19.990
<v Speaker 3>15 years old growing up in Poughkeepsie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York and get his hands on.</v>

1635
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.020
<v Speaker 3>So I would read that and I'd go to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>

1636
01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I try out all these weird things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>people like,</v>

1637
01:07:23.981 --> 01:07:26.020
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1638
01:07:26.021 --> 01:07:27.830
<v Speaker 3>when I was a kid I was swatting you'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>500,</v>

1639
01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:29.620
<v Speaker 3>four sets of eight reps and people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1640
01:07:29.621 --> 01:07:30.870
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does he squatted?</v>

1641
01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Six hundred and 75 pounds in high </v>
<v Speaker 3>school.</v>

1642
01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.380
<v Speaker 3>He was just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you won?</v>

1643
01:07:35.381 --> 01:07:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1644
01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:36.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not on anything.</v>

1645
01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I'm on Louie Simmons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1646
01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:41.650
<v Speaker 3>And so when I started training a mark to</v>
<v Speaker 3>just be,</v>

1647
01:07:41.651 --> 01:07:42.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an animal,</v>

1648
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:44.020
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1649
01:07:44.021 --> 01:07:49.021
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a lifting belt that said Roy </v>

1650
01:07:49.021 --> 01:07:49.780
<v Speaker 3>suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote out a director of bigger,</v>

1651
01:07:49.781 --> 01:07:51.220
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster ladies and gentlemen,</v>

1652
01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:53.290
<v Speaker 3>and it said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Roy suck.</v>

1653
01:07:53.291 --> 01:07:58.291
<v Speaker 3>And I would go to the gym and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys were like all juiced up like </v>

1654
01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:58.291
<v Speaker 3>Poughkeepsie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York.</v>

1655
01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what is in the water there,</v>

1656
01:07:59.981 --> 01:08:02.310
<v Speaker 3>but everybody was on something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1657
01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.570
<v Speaker 3>and I just always wanted to sort of deny</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1658
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:06.460
<v Speaker 3>go against that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not doing this.</v>

1659
01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.670
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why that was the whole,</v>

1660
01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:15.300
<v Speaker 3>the whole genesis for that movie was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that I always had this weird moral</v>

1661
01:08:16.190 --> 01:08:17.200
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1662
01:08:17.201 --> 01:08:18.140
<v Speaker 2>like against it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

1663
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just fucking cheating.</v>

1664
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you get some of those?</v>

1665
01:08:21.351 --> 01:08:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Caveman given us those nitro cans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those fuckers are good.</v>

1666
01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.880
<v Speaker 2>Bring in a few of those kind of kills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1667
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:30.020
<v Speaker 2>this is the good shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're out a regular coffee.</v>

1668
01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:35.210
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was it that pushed you over the </v>

1669
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:35.210
<v Speaker 2>edge of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>made you want to try steroids then?</v>

1670
01:08:35.210 --> 01:08:35.950
<v Speaker 2>How Old Society?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1671
01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.320
<v Speaker 2>I went to USC and there's hot chicks </v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere and I wasn't a gorilla.</v>

1672
01:08:39.321 --> 01:08:42.170
<v Speaker 2>You fucking squatting $600.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't really in good shape.</v>

1673
01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:47.171
<v Speaker 2>I didn't look good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all you have to do is clean up your </v>

1674
01:08:47.171 --> 01:08:49.721
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always had to kind of a conflict </v>

1675
01:08:49.721 --> 01:08:49.721
<v Speaker 2>with a with is like build.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's always been trying to get in better</v>

1676
01:08:49.721 --> 01:08:50.810
<v Speaker 2>shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think that uh,</v>

1677
01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 2>steroids is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a quicker and easier route in some cases</v>

1678
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:59.420
<v Speaker 2>to a get a little bit better shape and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally understand that.</v>

1679
01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.650
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

1680
01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:04.180
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you say you squat six 75 percent?</v>

1681
01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was younger.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you have to be a big fucker to do that.</v>

1684
01:09:08.830 --> 01:09:13.830
<v Speaker 2>That was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a little bit fatter than I am now </v>

<v Speaker 2>important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else was in good shape.</v>

<v Speaker 3>in general is weird.</v>

1753
01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:57.060
<v Speaker 3>Like wrestling another dude.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1755
01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:03.620
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we used to run this small wrestling </v>

1756

1758
01:12:10.110 --> 01:12:15.110
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of times like these young guys </v>
<v Speaker 3>had to work with the older guys like </v>

1759
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.110
<v Speaker 3>John Ciena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd be working with,</v>

1760
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greg,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you just to beat the shit out of here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like,</v>

1766
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:27.330
<v Speaker 3>that's part of a part of that.</v>

1771
01:12:36.951 --> 01:12:36.951
<v Speaker 3>the work.</v>

<v Speaker 3>make them look good,</v>

1773
01:12:37.381 --> 01:12:39.270

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:44.580
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.590
<v Speaker 3>he just told me to different moves he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to do and I was like,</v>

1782
01:12:55.591 --> 01:13:00.591

<v Speaker 3>getting into many moves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was what happened was he did the </v>

1786
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:08.630
<v Speaker 3>pinned them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you ended up winning.</v>

1787
01:13:08.630 --> 01:13:09.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He still does the superfly change.</v>

<v Speaker 3>by his fucking face and she went.</v>

1847
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:32.140
<v Speaker 3>I went to his house when we were doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>the documentary.</v>

1848
01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.090

<v Speaker 3>which I do all the Hollywood stuff.</v>

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:40.690
<v Speaker 3>all that kind of stuff and I just really</v>
<v Speaker 3>believed in it and I believed in it from</v>

1852
01:15:40.691 --> 01:15:45.691
<v Speaker 3>the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew they were making it and they </v>

1853
01:15:45.691 --> 01:15:48.301
<v Speaker 3>asked me to get behind it really early,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so when I went down to their house to </v>

1854
01:15:48.301 --> 01:15:48.330
<v Speaker 3>work on the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1855
01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.660
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take you through this yoga </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

1856
01:15:49.661 --> 01:15:50.200
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1857
01:15:50.201 --> 01:15:55.201
<v Speaker 3>what is this bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Within 10 minutes he had a heart rate </v>

1858
01:15:55.201 --> 01:15:56.110
<v Speaker 3>monitor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My heart rate was up to 1:55</v>

1859
01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:57.010
<v Speaker 3>and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1860
01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:59.140
<v Speaker 3>we got to slow you down to keep you at </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 1:45.</v>

1861
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.440
<v Speaker 3>So this is like this constant cardio </v>
<v Speaker 3>flexing,</v>

1862
01:16:02.710 --> 01:16:07.180
<v Speaker 3>moving,</v>

1863
01:16:07.181 --> 01:16:09.010
<v Speaker 3>needs for mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really,</v>

1864
01:16:09.011 --> 01:16:11.050
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a really cool thing that </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing well.</v>

1865
01:16:11.051 --> 01:16:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Yoga is great for mobility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really hard to do.</v>

1866
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:17.130
<v Speaker 3>It's one of those things where you look </v>
<v Speaker 3>at a bunch of fucking soccer moms,</v>

1867
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:18.700
<v Speaker 3>but then you get in there,</v>

1868
01:16:18.701 --> 01:16:21.550
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

1869
01:16:21.551 --> 01:16:23.290
<v Speaker 3>someone like me because it's a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>based.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Rick actually rate towards the end of </v>

1876
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:43.440
<v Speaker 3>doing bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

1877
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:43.440
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1878
01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:44.860
<v Speaker 3>when we were doing the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just worn down all the time.</v>

1879
01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:45.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what's going on.</v>

1880
01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:50.880
<v Speaker 3>I can barely walk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had just kept having all these </v>

1881
01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.850
<v Speaker 3>problems with my hips and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went and got it checked out and the </v>

1882
01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:53.850
<v Speaker 3>doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1883
01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:55.090
<v Speaker 3>walk across the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I walked across the room.</v>

1884
01:16:55.091 --> 01:16:57.790
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to fake ed two new hips.</v>

1885
01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:58.990
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1886
01:16:59.050 --> 01:16:59.860
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

1887
01:16:59.861 --> 01:17:00.870
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you need to new heads.</v>

1888
01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:03.970
<v Speaker 3>A doctor that itselves hips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an orthopedic surgeon,</v>

1889
01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:06.600
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when the,</v>

1890
01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.640
<v Speaker 3>what did the MRI reveal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they did bone on bone and my </v>

1891
01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:14.330
<v Speaker 3>bone was completely smashed on both </v>
<v Speaker 3>sides.</v>

1892
01:17:14.331 --> 01:17:17.470
<v Speaker 3>So they were smashed into the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>into your engineer.</v>

1893
01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.820
<v Speaker 3>He was in a lot of pain all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could only,</v>

1894
01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean like three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>four hours at a time was what you could </v>

1895
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:24.860
<v Speaker 3>give to the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually in a new.</v>

1896
01:17:24.860 --> 01:17:28.390
<v Speaker 3>We're just shy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sit down a lot and get out of this.</v>

1897
01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.380
<v Speaker 3>You said this is a genetic issue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1898
01:17:30.381 --> 01:17:32.810
<v Speaker 3>my dad has the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My Dad has two fake hips now,</v>

1899
01:17:32.811 --> 01:17:36.620
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't get him until way later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened was they,</v>

1900
01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:38.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows if,</v>

1901
01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:41.720
<v Speaker 3>if a wearing down of the hips squatting </v>
<v Speaker 3>all that much and whatever.</v>

1902
01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.840
<v Speaker 3>I don't really blame it on power lifting</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I don't think that that's really</v>

1903
01:17:44.841 --> 01:17:49.841
<v Speaker 3>the cause because there's a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>power lifters out there and I'm the one </v>

1904
01:17:49.841 --> 01:17:49.841
<v Speaker 3>with two fake hips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1905
01:17:49.841 --> 01:17:50.990
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh this happens.</v>

1906
01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:52.070
<v Speaker 3>Every power lifter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1907
01:17:52.071 --> 01:17:54.150
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean you think it has mess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some effect.</v>

1908
01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I think everything has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything has an effect.</v>

1909
01:17:56.901 --> 01:17:58.440
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like they played football,</v>

1910
01:17:58.441 --> 01:18:00.860
<v Speaker 3>you wrestled like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's,</v>

1911
01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:01.730
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1912
01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:04.310
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have to fake hips and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same genetics,</v>

1913
01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:05.350
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as you know,</v>

1914
01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:06.470
<v Speaker 3>as me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

1915
01:18:06.471 --> 01:18:08.080
<v Speaker 3>I got it from my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1916
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:11.600
<v Speaker 3>my dad has the same but what do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do they classify it as?</v>

1917
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:15.440
<v Speaker 3>What are they classified as?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just osteoarthritis and it's just so.</v>

1918
01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.410
<v Speaker 3>But you only get into your hips now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have it in my ankles and my knees.</v>

1919
01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:19.970
<v Speaker 3>I had both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My knees need to be replaced,</v>

1920
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:21.260
<v Speaker 3>but I'm just sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>

1921
01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:23.420
<v Speaker 3>I just sorta like putting that off </v>
<v Speaker 3>because like you said,</v>

1922
01:18:23.421 --> 01:18:27.210
<v Speaker 3>we have new therapies that you had your </v>
<v Speaker 3>knees done when you were a kid too,</v>

1923
01:18:27.211 --> 01:18:27.400
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1924
01:18:27.401 --> 01:18:29.540
<v Speaker 3>When I was 17 years old I had double </v>
<v Speaker 3>knee surgery.</v>

1925
01:18:29.541 --> 01:18:31.820
<v Speaker 3>So would you have done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just had arthroscopic,</v>

1926
01:18:31.821 --> 01:18:33.950
<v Speaker 3>a bone chips removed and stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1927
01:18:33.951 --> 01:18:34.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1928
01:18:34.311 --> 01:18:39.311
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing is I've been in pain my whole </v>

1929
01:18:39.311 --> 01:18:39.311
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1930
01:18:39.311 --> 01:18:40.560
<v Speaker 3>and there was a certain point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1931
01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:45.730
<v Speaker 3>when I got the hip surgery that I wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>able to able to handle it anymore and </v>

1932
01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:46.510
<v Speaker 3>they started feeding me pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1933
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:51.520
<v Speaker 3>like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I got into that really hardcore </v>

1934
01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:51.770
<v Speaker 3>because that was something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1935
01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:57.160
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at first you do it because it helps the </v>

1936
01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.340
<v Speaker 3>pain and then after a while you do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's fun.</v>

1937
01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.770
<v Speaker 3>So this is post bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>

1941
01:19:03.111 --> 01:19:05.510
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get your double hip replacements and</v>

1942
01:19:05.511 --> 01:19:07.010
<v Speaker 3>then you had the pill problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1943
01:19:07.011 --> 01:19:08.270
<v Speaker 3>I got hooked on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1944
01:19:08.271 --> 01:19:08.660
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1945
01:19:08.670 --> 01:19:10.520
<v Speaker 3>you never aspire to become a drug </v>
<v Speaker 3>addict,</v>

1946
01:19:10.521 --> 01:19:13.000
<v Speaker 3>but it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm a lot happened.</v>

1947
01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:18.020
<v Speaker 3>A lot of my friends had happened to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of people doing a lot of people I </v>

1948
01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:18.770
<v Speaker 3>know think a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think a little bit of that had to do</v>

1949
01:19:18.771 --> 01:19:23.771
<v Speaker 3>with like the recovery because you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>both of them done rather than just like </v>

1950
01:19:23.771 --> 01:19:23.771
<v Speaker 3>one of them done at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1951
01:19:23.771 --> 01:19:28.030
<v Speaker 3>I would always suggest to anybody that </v>
<v Speaker 3>has to have double hip replacement </v>

1952
01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:30.791
<v Speaker 3>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we get one done at a time because at </v>

1953
01:19:30.791 --> 01:19:30.791
<v Speaker 3>least you have one side that's good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the other side that heals.</v>

1954
01:19:30.791 --> 01:19:32.270
<v Speaker 3>He literally couldn't really move at </v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

1955
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I was sort of like in a point in my life</v>
<v Speaker 3>where I'm like,</v>

1956
01:19:34.281 --> 01:19:35.240
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just do it.</v>

1957
01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go in and didn't really think it </v>

1958
01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:40.330
<v Speaker 3>through that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How old were you?</v>

1959
01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:42.080
<v Speaker 3>Thirty three at the time and who?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1960
01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:45.710
<v Speaker 3>Double Hip replacement at 33 and if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what a double hip replacement</v>

1961
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:50.770
<v Speaker 3>means,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they cut off the top of the bone and </v>

1962
01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:53.741
<v Speaker 3>they literally have this long screw that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they drive into the meat of the bone </v>

1963
01:19:53.961 --> 01:19:56.600
<v Speaker 3>where the marrow is and it locks in </v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

1964
01:19:56.601 --> 01:19:59.670
<v Speaker 3>This new fake hip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1965
01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:03.860
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking gnarly shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Graham Hancock had it done.</v>

1966
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:08.920
<v Speaker 3>He was here six weeks later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't even walking with a limp when </v>

1967
01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:08.920
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy.</v>

1968
01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:08.920
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

1969
01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.040
<v Speaker 1>had a hip replacement complications with</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine,</v>

1970
01:20:11.041 --> 01:20:14.340
<v Speaker 1>so I'm on one of the sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Added had complications of getting it in</v>

1971
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.220
<v Speaker 1>because they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1972
01:20:15.221 --> 01:20:17.880
<v Speaker 1>all this muscle from squatting your ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like a rock.</v>

1973
01:20:17.881 --> 01:20:20.160
<v Speaker 1>So they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to pound it in with a hammer.</v>

1974
01:20:20.161 --> 01:20:20.870
<v Speaker 1>It looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1975
01:20:21.270 --> 01:20:26.270
<v Speaker 1>I saw the surgery part of the surgery </v>
<v Speaker 1>back on camera and it looked like an </v>

1976
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:28.200
<v Speaker 1>auto body shop fixing the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:31.860
<v Speaker 1>There's a video of Tito Ortiz getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is a disc replaced in his neck?</v>

1978
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.010
<v Speaker 1>She just got a disc fused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you gotta.</v>

1979
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure it was a spacer or disc </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced,</v>

1980
01:20:37.140 --> 01:20:39.270
<v Speaker 1>but they're fucking hammering on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>neck.</v>

1981
01:20:39.271 --> 01:20:40.430
<v Speaker 1>Like clink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clink,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That is insane.</v>

1986
01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:51.840
<v Speaker 1>So what does it feel like now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now actually the hips feel okay.</v>

1987
01:20:51.841 --> 01:20:53.360
<v Speaker 1>If I lift heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still like,</v>

1988
01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.840
<v Speaker 1>I'll still squat and dead lift.</v>

1989
01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:59.840
<v Speaker 1>I just can't go as heavy as I used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have dead lifted up to 50 slash 50 with </v>

1990
01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:01.010
<v Speaker 1>two fake hips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Not a very good deadlift and mark's </v>

01:21:06.630 --> 01:21:08.830
<v Speaker 1>And they're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't mean they're built.</v>

<v Speaker 1>possible and I think that the best way </v>

2037
01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.830
<v Speaker 1>to go is uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying new therapies like stem cells,</v>

<v Speaker 1>other things that are coming out.</v>

2048
01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.840
<v Speaker 1>like a scaffolding and they implanted </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside where your meniscus,</v>

2049
01:23:26.841 --> 01:23:31.841
<v Speaker 1>she used to be in with these proteins in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and somehow or another your body </v>

2050
01:23:31.841 --> 01:23:35.551
<v Speaker 1>grows meniscus in the scaffolding as it </v>

<v Speaker 1>here and there and he's got a huge,</v>

2087
01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.520
<v Speaker 1>his own gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huge Gym.</v>

2088
01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:58.480

<v Speaker 1>Give it a plug.</v>

2089
01:24:58.481 --> 01:25:03.481
<v Speaker 1>What's the name of the gym?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The super training gym just in West </v>

2090
01:25:03.481 --> 01:25:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Sacramento,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because it's free.</v>

2091
01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of weird.</v>

2092
01:25:05.470 --> 01:25:07.270
<v Speaker 1>It's free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gym is free.</v>

2093
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:09.430
<v Speaker 1>How's that work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>

2094
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:13.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not the smartest business models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not My brightest idea.</v>

2095
01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.460
<v Speaker 1>What a gym is free.</v>

2096
01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:16.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a way for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2097
01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:21.840
<v Speaker 1>give back to power lifting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's predominantly a power thing </v>

2098
01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:21.840
<v Speaker 1>facility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2099
01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:25.150
<v Speaker 1>and I think that if other people had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to make their gym free,</v>

2100
01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:30.151
<v Speaker 1>they probably would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm in a position to make it for </v>

2101
01:25:30.151 --> 01:25:30.160
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did.</v>

2102
01:25:30.580 --> 01:25:31.810
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's crazy.</v>

2103
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:33.280
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful thing.</v>

2104
01:25:33.281 --> 01:25:38.281
<v Speaker 1>Then you never hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You usually find exact opposite to what </v>

2105
01:25:38.281 --> 01:25:38.281
<v Speaker 1>everybody asks for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2106
01:25:38.281 --> 01:25:39.340
<v Speaker 1>can you train me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you train me?</v>

2107
01:25:39.341 --> 01:25:40.360
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't train people.</v>

2108
01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.610
<v Speaker 1>I even do seminars and stuff a lot for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

2109
01:25:42.611 --> 01:25:47.611
<v Speaker 1>I just did one at a deuces gym in Venice</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a lot of times I'll do them to </v>

2110
01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:51.220
<v Speaker 1>some down in downtown La at the Barbell </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brigade,</v>

2111
01:25:51.221 --> 01:25:53.890
<v Speaker 1>but just if I'm in town somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

2112
01:25:53.891 --> 01:25:54.970

<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

2113
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll email email the owner of the gym to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

2114
01:25:58.391 --> 01:26:03.391

2121
01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:18.400
<v Speaker 3>instructing them because I think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>the main message is to get people moving</v>

2122
01:26:18.401 --> 01:26:20.840
<v Speaker 3>and get people doing shit rather than </v>

01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:00.770
<v Speaker 3>used to be able to crush it up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>inject it and all that,</v>

2170
01:28:00.771 --> 01:28:05.771
<v Speaker 3>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was getting into that kind of </v>

2171
01:28:05.771 --> 01:28:05.771
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2172
01:28:05.771 --> 01:28:09.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he's injecting it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was definitely snorting it and </v>

2173
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.590
<v Speaker 3>different things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He loved it all.</v>

2174
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:14.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My parents found out about it and they </v>

2175
01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:14.890
<v Speaker 3>were obviously heartbroken and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>helped him,</v>

2176
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:17.120
<v Speaker 3>helps him get clean for awhile and then,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2177
01:28:17.121 --> 01:28:19.490
<v Speaker 3>then you go back to it and back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth and back and forth.</v>

2178
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:23.000
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just crazy because he,</v>

2179
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:26.300
<v Speaker 3>after he got off all the pills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorta switched to alcohol,</v>

2180
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:28.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was like alcohol a little bit.</v>

2181
01:28:28.551 --> 01:28:29.600
<v Speaker 3>Everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of weed,</v>

2182
01:28:29.601 --> 01:28:31.160
<v Speaker 3>a lot of alcohol and this and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2183
01:28:31.161 --> 01:28:32.050
<v Speaker 3>just things that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2184
01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:37.600
<v Speaker 3>that when you're not in the right state </v>
<v Speaker 3>of mind or you're depressed or not the </v>

2185
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:37.600
<v Speaker 3>best things for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2186
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:41.860
<v Speaker 3>And he ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seemed like from the day he ended up </v>

2187
01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.830
<v Speaker 3>going down like a really bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a bad,</v>

2188
01:28:43.870 --> 01:28:45.170
<v Speaker 3>a bad spiral,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2189
01:28:45.171 --> 01:28:50.171
<v Speaker 3>and he was on some psych meds to a for </v>
<v Speaker 3>depression and different things like </v>

2190
01:28:50.171 --> 01:28:50.810
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2191
01:28:50.811 --> 01:28:55.040
<v Speaker 3>he died in a sober living house with no </v>
<v Speaker 3>real explanation of how he died.</v>

2192
01:28:55.430 --> 01:29:00.430
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we still don't really know exactly what </v>

2193
01:29:00.430 --> 01:29:02.711
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was really no drugs found in his </v>

2194
01:29:02.711 --> 01:29:02.711
<v Speaker 3>system in a toxicology report and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2195
01:29:02.711 --> 01:29:04.770
<v Speaker 3>So it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to me something where,</v>

2196
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:06.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2197
01:29:06.151 --> 01:29:08.520
<v Speaker 3>this is an epidemic that hit home with </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

2198
01:29:08.770 --> 01:29:13.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I saw my brother died and I was </v>

2199
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:13.770
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will never go down that path and there</v>

2200
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:15.660
<v Speaker 3>I am on the floor scrambling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for like another Vicodin,</v>

2201
01:29:15.661 --> 01:29:16.110
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

2202
01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:21.120
<v Speaker 3>I must've dropped one somewhere and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing a lot of other people that went </v>

2203
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.221
<v Speaker 3>through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I decided to pick up and make a movie </v>

2204
01:29:25.221 --> 01:29:25.221
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now your brother in your bigger,</v>

2205
01:29:25.221 --> 01:29:25.221
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster.</v>

2206
01:29:25.221 --> 01:29:26.790
<v Speaker 3>Seemed like a very troubled guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:29:26.850 --> 01:29:27.440
<v Speaker 3>Mad Dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2208
01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:29.580
<v Speaker 3>He struggled with himself more so than </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything else.</v>

2209
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:34.470
<v Speaker 3>He was bipolar and so all this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of compounded that.</v>

2210
01:29:34.980 --> 01:29:37.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we get a prescription.</v>

2211
01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:42.081
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but did he get a prescription for an </v>

2212
01:29:42.081 --> 01:29:44.481
<v Speaker 3>injury or how did he get it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was wrestling with the wwe who was </v>

2213
01:29:44.481 --> 01:29:44.481
<v Speaker 3>sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2214
01:29:44.481 --> 01:29:45.280
<v Speaker 3>on the going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>

2215
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.170
<v Speaker 3>doing the rounds.</v>

2216
01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:48.690
<v Speaker 3>And so if you've got a prescription but </v>
<v Speaker 3>he got drugs.</v>

2217
01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2218
01:29:49.470 --> 01:29:54.470
<v Speaker 3>And they all got drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When did he start wrestling for the wwe </v>

2219
01:29:54.470 --> 01:29:55.350
<v Speaker 3>pro?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Back in like 1990,</v>

2220
01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:59.040
<v Speaker 3>like early nineties and he wrestled </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever,</v>

2221
01:29:59.041 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 3>like he was always on tv or so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>93,</v>

2222
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.630
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was always on TV and then he wrestled</v>

2223
01:30:03.631 --> 01:30:06.690
<v Speaker 3>all the way through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of up until he died.</v>

2224
01:30:06.691 --> 01:30:11.691
<v Speaker 3>Like he had some still some matches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really with wwe but with other </v>

2225
01:30:11.691 --> 01:30:15.690
<v Speaker 3>smaller federations and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he kind of wrestled for a real long </v>

2226
01:30:15.690 --> 01:30:16.890
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he never really made it and that was</v>

2227
01:30:16.891 --> 01:30:18.610
<v Speaker 3>a really big problem for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2228
01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:21.090
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't good enough to be a good coach</v>

2229
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:23.100
<v Speaker 3>or a good teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to.</v>

2230
01:30:23.130 --> 01:30:24.450
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to make it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to be.</v>

2231
01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:27.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he knew exactly what he </v>
<v Speaker 3>was chasing.</v>

2232
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:29.940
<v Speaker 3>So even if he obtained some of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>success,</v>

2233
01:30:29.941 --> 01:30:32.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't think he would even recognized </v>
<v Speaker 3>it along the way.</v>

2234
01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:37.780
<v Speaker 3>Point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good point and I think a </v>

2235
01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:37.780
<v Speaker 3>lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2236
01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:40.251
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's hard to get satisfied with certain </v>

2237
01:30:40.251 --> 01:30:40.251
<v Speaker 3>things and so he was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was troubled.</v>

2238
01:30:40.251 --> 01:30:40.620
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2239
01:30:40.650 --> 01:30:44.110
<v Speaker 3>the quote that's on the wall in my gym </v>
<v Speaker 3>is a from the film,</v>

2240
01:30:44.210 --> 01:30:46.020
<v Speaker 3>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather be dead than average.</v>

2241
01:30:46.050 --> 01:30:48.030
<v Speaker 3>And that was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that he,</v>

2242
01:30:48.031 --> 01:30:48.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he just,</v>

2243
01:30:48.751 --> 01:30:50.510
<v Speaker 3>he couldn't live without,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2244
01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:55.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being with whatever his ideal for </v>

2245
01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:57.951
<v Speaker 3>success was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem I think that you really </v>

2246
01:30:57.951 --> 01:30:58.380
<v Speaker 3>just nailed though is that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what that is.</v>

2247
01:30:58.381 --> 01:31:00.300
<v Speaker 3>What's that goal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

2248
01:31:00.600 --> 01:31:03.570
<v Speaker 3>And if they don't ever reach it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never feel satisfied.</v>

2249
01:31:03.630 --> 01:31:05.800
<v Speaker 3>And the thing is that he be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite it all,</v>

2250
01:31:05.801 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 3>that he's like the nicest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>coolest guy in the world.</v>

2251
01:31:08.730 --> 01:31:10.100
<v Speaker 3>And we would have our backs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2252
01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.220
<v Speaker 3>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on everything today.</v>

2253
01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:12.360
<v Speaker 3>You have good friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2254
01:31:12.570 --> 01:31:16.350
<v Speaker 3>He had crazy emotional really what </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody has,</v>

2255
01:31:16.351 --> 01:31:18.810
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have good friends and then they get</v>

2256
01:31:18.811 --> 01:31:20.460
<v Speaker 3>into drugs and then they don't have good</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends,</v>

2257
01:31:20.461 --> 01:31:22.530
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have a lot of enabling people,</v>

2258
01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.680
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that will allow you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>keep doing what you're doing.</v>

2259
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:27.360
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people that will put up with </v>
<v Speaker 3>your bullshit.</v>

2260
01:31:27.730 --> 01:31:29.340
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my father wasn't one of them,</v>

2261
01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:34.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my father was somebody who like put his </v>

2262
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.420
<v Speaker 3>foot down and was helping them get clean</v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

2263
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:39.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just weren't able to catch it in </v>

2264
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.470
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2265
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.470
<v Speaker 3>and so people that are listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

2266
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:41.280
<v Speaker 3>I think it's really important to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>about these issues.</v>

2267
01:31:41.281 --> 01:31:42.470
<v Speaker 3>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2268
01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.360
<v Speaker 3>people want to always trying to push </v>
<v Speaker 3>these issues under the rug.</v>

2269
01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:50.360
<v Speaker 3>So if he knows someone who's struggling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try your best to reach out to them and </v>

2270
01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:50.400
<v Speaker 3>just see if you can get to the bottom of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the problem.</v>

2271
01:31:50.401 --> 01:31:55.401
<v Speaker 3>I know it's the worst fucking thing in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the world to try to approach somebody </v>

2272
01:31:55.401 --> 01:31:56.130
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but see if you know,</v>

2273
01:31:56.131 --> 01:32:01.131
<v Speaker 3>whatever you think is a good way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>going about doing it and try to reach </v>

2274
01:32:01.131 --> 01:32:02.560
<v Speaker 3>out to the person because you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much longer it will be here for.</v>

2275
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:04.670
<v Speaker 3>It's just so hard to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to you though,</v>

2276
01:32:04.671 --> 01:32:05.410
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's brutal.</v>

2277
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.180
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2278
01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:09.340
<v Speaker 3>When you've been through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a different.</v>

2279
01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:11.880
<v Speaker 3>It completely becomes different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2280
01:32:11.881 --> 01:32:13.510
<v Speaker 3>I went through it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ended up,</v>

2281
01:32:13.511 --> 01:32:18.511
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of crazy halfway through this </v>

2282
01:32:18.511 --> 01:32:21.690
<v Speaker 3>film that I was making relapsing and </v>
<v Speaker 3>started popping xanax and all sorts of </v>

2283
01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:23.920
<v Speaker 3>other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Film on prescription drugs.</v>

2284
01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:25.420
<v Speaker 3>You start relapsing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2285
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:27.760
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck?</v>

2286
01:32:27.761 --> 01:32:30.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how crazy.</v>

2287
01:32:30.190 --> 01:32:33.070
<v Speaker 3>When did you do this film?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We finished it.</v>

2288
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:36.460
<v Speaker 3>We finished it for Tribeca film </v>
<v Speaker 3>festival.</v>

2289
01:32:36.461 --> 01:32:39.060
<v Speaker 3>So that was like in May.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

2290
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:42.910
<v Speaker 3>you relapsed like a year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year and five months ago.</v>

2291
01:32:43.310 --> 01:32:44.320
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2292
01:32:44.321 --> 01:32:46.300
<v Speaker 3>I was popping xanax and stuff like that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know,</v>

2293
01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.910
<v Speaker 3>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>filmmaking is not an easy business,</v>

2294
01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:50.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause like if you were,</v>

2295
01:32:50.470 --> 01:32:52.060
<v Speaker 3>if you didn't have all this other stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

2296
01:32:52.061 --> 01:32:54.070
<v Speaker 3>you were just a comic and you were </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to make it.</v>

2297
01:32:54.071 --> 01:32:55.600
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's brutal.</v>

2298
01:32:55.930 --> 01:33:00.930
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ups and downs and oh I have an </v>

2299
01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:00.930
<v Speaker 3>audition for something I've seen other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people be successful can really beat you</v>

2300
01:33:00.930 --> 01:33:05.791
<v Speaker 3>down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fly by you that were like way behind </v>

2301
01:33:05.791 --> 01:33:05.791
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2302
01:33:05.791 --> 01:33:06.220
<v Speaker 3>all these different things that go on in</v>
<v Speaker 3>your head.</v>

2303
01:33:06.221 --> 01:33:08.690
<v Speaker 3>You feel like that about the documentary</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

2304
01:33:08.690 --> 01:33:13.690
<v Speaker 3>That's like people that were making some</v>
<v Speaker 3>documentaries that would do really well </v>

2305
01:33:13.690 --> 01:33:13.990
<v Speaker 3>and you get bummed out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't really get bummed out so much</v>

2306
01:33:13.991 --> 01:33:18.991
<v Speaker 3>about other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to always stay in my own lane and </v>

2307
01:33:18.991 --> 01:33:21.451
<v Speaker 3>think about myself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I get more bummed out putting the </v>

2308
01:33:21.451 --> 01:33:22.330
<v Speaker 3>pressure on myself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody elements do real well and you go,</v>

2309
01:33:22.331 --> 01:33:23.600
<v Speaker 3>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why am I doing?</v>

2310
01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:26.230
<v Speaker 3>I could have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or somebody makes a documentary and then</v>

2311
01:33:26.231 --> 01:33:29.540
<v Speaker 3>they're like off to the races doing like</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these big movies and you know,</v>

2312
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:29.880
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

2313
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Why didn't somebody pick me for that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2314
01:33:31.511 --> 01:33:34.670
<v Speaker 3>like my documentary did way better than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that documentary or so you know,</v>

2315
01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:36.280
<v Speaker 3>those kinds of things in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your eyes.</v>

2316
01:33:36.281 --> 01:33:41.281
<v Speaker 3>But just the film world in general,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood in general gave me this </v>

2317
01:33:41.281 --> 01:33:45.061
<v Speaker 3>feeling of enact adequacy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gave me a feeling like I wasn't good </v>

2318
01:33:45.061 --> 01:33:45.061
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

2319
01:33:45.061 --> 01:33:45.910
<v Speaker 3>Like everything I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't making it and people go,</v>

2320
01:33:45.911 --> 01:33:48.520
<v Speaker 3>well you did this hit movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was really big and like,</v>

2321
01:33:48.521 --> 01:33:53.521
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it didn't really make money at the </v>

2322
01:33:53.521 --> 01:33:53.830
<v Speaker 3>box office like it did really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is a not your original intent.</v>

2323
01:33:53.831 --> 01:33:55.030
<v Speaker 3>Like when he made the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

2324
01:33:55.031 --> 01:33:59.290
<v Speaker 3>I want a lot of people to see the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tons of people seeing your language.</v>

2325
01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:02.260
<v Speaker 3>When you say it gave you this feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 3>inadequacy,</v>

2326
01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.290
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that maybe the way you </v>
<v Speaker 3>approached it yourself?</v>

2327
01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems obvious giving you anything,</v>

2328
01:34:07.361 --> 01:34:08.950
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made that up in his own head.</v>

2329
01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:12.130
<v Speaker 3>In your own head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel inadequate.</v>

2330
01:34:12.131 --> 01:34:13.090
<v Speaker 3>You feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>

2331
01:34:13.091 --> 01:34:13.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

2332
01:34:13.690 --> 01:34:16.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as many as many people tell you that</v>

2333
01:34:16.451 --> 01:34:19.090
<v Speaker 3>you do good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still looking for,</v>

2334
01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.710
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're still searching for that thing.</v>

2335
01:34:20.711 --> 01:34:23.530
<v Speaker 3>So for me it was all about finding </v>
<v Speaker 3>balance.</v>

2336
01:34:23.530 --> 01:34:27.130
<v Speaker 3>So when I relapsed and realize I need </v>
<v Speaker 3>help,</v>

2337
01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.750
<v Speaker 3>that's A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I reached out.</v>

2338
01:34:29.230 --> 01:34:31.450
<v Speaker 3>I didn't really reach out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But once I,</v>

2339
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:34.150
<v Speaker 3>once I knew I needed help and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of figured me out,</v>

2340
01:34:34.151 --> 01:34:36.550
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend helped me a lot with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2341
01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:39.310
<v Speaker 3>she sort of found me a really fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 3>one day,</v>

2342
01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:43.240
<v Speaker 3>a drunk and on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on Xanax in the middle of the night.</v>

2343
01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:45.250
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she called me.</v>

2344
01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:47.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't really answer my phone a whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>lot.</v>

2345
01:34:47.250 --> 01:34:48.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't respond to it,</v>

2346
01:34:48.881 --> 01:34:53.881
<v Speaker 3>a ton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>rings a lot and I get a lot of messages </v>

2347
01:34:53.881 --> 01:34:56.551
<v Speaker 3>and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not really a on my phone that </v>

2348
01:34:56.551 --> 01:34:57.770
<v Speaker 3>much for that kind of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I noticed a number of was odd and it</v>

2349
01:34:57.771 --> 01:35:00.260
<v Speaker 3>was probably like about midnight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it was like,</v>

2350
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.470
<v Speaker 3>it just seems kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not like a telemarketer,</v>

2351
01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:05.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like calling it like 7:00</v>

2352
01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:05.720
<v Speaker 3>PM or something.</v>

2353
01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.720
<v Speaker 3>This is something different and for </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever reason,</v>

2354
01:35:08.721 --> 01:35:11.460
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have her number in my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2355
01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:13.280
<v Speaker 3>but it was from like Pennsylvania or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

2356
01:35:13.281 --> 01:35:16.070
<v Speaker 3>I think where she's originally from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

2357
01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:18.140
<v Speaker 3>it was lauren and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2358
01:35:18.141 --> 01:35:20.060
<v Speaker 3>your brother is blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

2359
01:35:20.061 --> 01:35:25.061
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I couldn't understand what she was </v>

2360
01:35:25.061 --> 01:35:25.061
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was very,</v>

2361
01:35:25.061 --> 01:35:25.061
<v Speaker 3>very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a very sad and crying and stuff.</v>

2362
01:35:25.061 --> 01:35:29.921
<v Speaker 3>And so I asked her to kind of calmed </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and I'm kind of assess the </v>

2363
01:35:29.921 --> 01:35:30.800
<v Speaker 3>situation a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

2364
01:35:30.801 --> 01:35:32.510
<v Speaker 3>I think your brother's in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2367
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.620
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you're going to find them because I </v>

<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know how bad the situation was </v>

2375
01:35:50.951 --> 01:35:50.951
<v Speaker 3>or how serious it was.</v>

2376
01:35:50.951 --> 01:35:53.270
<v Speaker 3>I did know his friend,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his friend called me a few times that,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2382
01:35:59.230 --> 01:36:04.230

<v Speaker 3>person again and I'd find out that he's </v>

2383
01:36:04.230 --> 01:36:06.170
<v Speaker 3>doing a little bit better and then he'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>be doing a little bit worse.</v>

2384

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to reach out to him.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I do love him.</v>

2390

<v Speaker 3>of ways and uh,</v>

2391
01:36:21.461 --> 01:36:26.461

<v Speaker 3>but I just didn't know how to fucking </v>

2392

<v Speaker 3>called.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just said,</v>

2396
01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:37.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take his keys away and make sure he's </v>

2397
01:36:37.481 --> 01:36:37.481
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talk to my wife,</v>

2398
01:36:37.481 --> 01:36:41.171
<v Speaker 3>my wife's fucking awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's super supportive about all this </v>

2399
01:36:41.171 --> 01:36:41.171
<v Speaker 3>kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she said,</v>

2400
01:36:41.171 --> 01:36:42.380
<v Speaker 3>we need to fly him here tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

2401
01:36:42.381 --> 01:36:43.160
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2402
01:36:43.460 --> 01:36:46.430
<v Speaker 3>let's fly lauren here to make sure he </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets on the fucking flight,</v>

2403
01:36:46.431 --> 01:36:51.431
<v Speaker 3>that he's not drinking or taking pills </v>
<v Speaker 3>or doing something crazy and he misses </v>

2404
01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:52.640
<v Speaker 3>his flight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we flew both of them up.</v>

2405
01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:55.970
<v Speaker 3>We're able to get him some treatment </v>
<v Speaker 3>where he was able to,</v>

2406
01:36:56.930 --> 01:36:58.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>work on starting to recover.</v>

2407
01:36:59.540 --> 01:37:01.120
<v Speaker 3>It's a nasty path,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2408
01:37:01.121 --> 01:37:01.750
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2409
01:37:01.751 --> 01:37:03.920
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you document this in the film?</v>

2410
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:07.820
<v Speaker 3>I didn't document all the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 3>went down,</v>

2411
01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:08.900
<v Speaker 3>like leading up to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yeah,</v>

2412
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:13.990
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's in the film we talk about it for </v>

2413
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:13.990
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

2414
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:13.990
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like I said,</v>

2415
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:16.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a nasty path that like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like a snowball effect,</v>

2416
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:17.900
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And looking,</v>

2417
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:19.850
<v Speaker 3>looking at it now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2418
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:23.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's not funny ever but it's like</v>
<v Speaker 3>laughable how like,</v>

2419
01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:24.860
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck was I thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2420
01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:27.710
<v Speaker 3>I can see it now from a different point </v>
<v Speaker 3>of view.</v>

2421
01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:32.240
<v Speaker 3>So you said you relapsed on Xanax.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So was it just you were having anxiety?</v>

2422
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:36.320
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think that it's just whatever,</v>

2423
01:37:36.321 --> 01:37:38.040
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just like to take it because a,</v>

2424
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:39.250
<v Speaker 3>it may,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2425
01:37:39.490 --> 01:37:40.730
<v Speaker 3>you can't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

2426
01:37:40.780 --> 01:37:45.780
<v Speaker 3>my mind is always racing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always another idea in the head </v>

2427
01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:45.780
<v Speaker 3>and there's always,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't go to sleep,</v>

2428
01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.620
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've tried the float,</v>

2429
01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.720
<v Speaker 3>the float chambers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've tried stuff like that.</v>

2430
01:37:50.721 --> 01:37:55.721
<v Speaker 3>I can't even get my mind to stop </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking a lot of times or so I thought</v>

2431
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:01.070
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always thought that I needed </v>

2432
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.070
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it was alcohol,</v>

2433
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:02.040
<v Speaker 2>whether it was pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I realized through the whole journey</v>

2434
01:38:02.130 --> 01:38:07.130
<v Speaker 2>that all I really needed was to believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>in myself again to believe in who I </v>

2435
01:38:07.130 --> 01:38:11.421
<v Speaker 2>really was and what I started doing when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started out trying to make films in </v>

2436
01:38:11.421 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 2>the first place and tell the truth and </v>
<v Speaker 2>be honest.</v>

2437
01:38:13.410 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 2>The problem was I couldn't be honest </v>
<v Speaker 2>with myself.</v>

2438
01:38:15.630 --> 01:38:20.630
<v Speaker 2>I had a real hard time being honest with</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself and that's what a recovery has </v>

2439
01:38:20.630 --> 01:38:21.930
<v Speaker 2>has brought to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2440
01:38:21.931 --> 01:38:23.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing to be able to know how much</v>

2441
01:38:23.851 --> 01:38:26.190
<v Speaker 2>he's allowed to talk about the film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll talk about it a little bit.</v>

2442
01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:27.290
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2443
01:38:27.690 --> 01:38:32.690
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he basically interviewed somebody for </v>

2444
01:38:32.690 --> 01:38:32.690
<v Speaker 2>the film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2445
01:38:32.690 --> 01:38:33.060
<v Speaker 2>the ended up helping him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He interviewed this guy,</v>

2446
01:38:33.061 --> 01:38:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Richard Tate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>

2447
01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:38.991
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>owns a treatment center in Malibu and </v>

2448
01:38:38.991 --> 01:38:38.991
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for his film,</v>

2449
01:38:38.991 --> 01:38:43.371
<v Speaker 2>he researched it and they had like a 95 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent success rate with people that </v>

2450
01:38:43.371 --> 01:38:43.830
<v Speaker 2>were there I think for over 60 days or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

2451
01:38:44.010 --> 01:38:45.840
<v Speaker 2>90 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 days.</v>

2452
01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:47.010
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>

2453
01:38:47.011 --> 01:38:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Ninety five percent success rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2454
01:38:49.051 --> 01:38:50.550
<v Speaker 2>The whole time I'm interviewing the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

2455
01:38:50.551 --> 01:38:55.551
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could come here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish I could come here because I knew </v>

2456
01:38:55.551 --> 01:38:55.840
<v Speaker 2>that I still had a problem with alcohol </v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

2457
01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:59.130
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't really doing xanax at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like he researched it for himself.</v>

2458
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:01.260
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to tell him stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's researching for the film,</v>

2459
01:39:01.290 --> 01:39:03.000
<v Speaker 2>but he's researched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weird thing,</v>

2460
01:39:03.001 --> 01:39:04.190
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start like looking,</v>

2461
01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:05.800
<v Speaker 2>did you go to this place?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2462
01:39:05.850 --> 01:39:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I ended up going to cliffside Malibu for</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 days.</v>

2463
01:39:09.300 --> 01:39:14.300
<v Speaker 2>So what do they do that so successful?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just change your life about </v>

2464
01:39:14.300 --> 01:39:18.891
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Richard Tate was a wild man himself </v>

2465
01:39:18.891 --> 01:39:18.891
<v Speaker 2>and he gave me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing,</v>

2466
01:39:18.891 --> 01:39:19.230
<v Speaker 2>when you have a guide telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

2467
01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:23.490
<v Speaker 2>14 years ago I was on my couch smoking </v>
<v Speaker 2>crack with a hooker on each side.</v>

2468
01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:25.980
<v Speaker 2>I was oiled up for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smoking,</v>

2469
01:39:25.981 --> 01:39:26.850
<v Speaker 2>cigar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking,</v>

2470
01:39:26.851 --> 01:39:28.020
<v Speaker 2>crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2471
01:39:28.050 --> 01:39:29.250
<v Speaker 2>and those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good time.</v>

2472
01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:29.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2473
01:39:30.710 --> 01:39:32.490
<v Speaker 2>And it tells you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2474
01:39:32.491 --> 01:39:35.730
<v Speaker 2>that eight of his friends come and knock</v>
<v Speaker 2>on his door and try to get him sober and</v>

2475
01:39:35.731 --> 01:39:38.460
<v Speaker 2>he slams his door the door in his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2476
01:39:38.480 --> 01:39:39.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

2477
01:39:39.031 --> 01:39:39.910
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was rude.</v>

2478
01:39:39.911 --> 01:39:41.040
<v Speaker 2>He goes back and opens the door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

2479
01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:42.090
<v Speaker 2>what day is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they said,</v>

2480
01:39:42.091 --> 01:39:44.850
<v Speaker 2>it's Friday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

2481
01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:46.920
<v Speaker 2>come back on a Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he slams the door.</v>

2482
01:39:47.100 --> 01:39:49.560
<v Speaker 2>They come back on Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

2483
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:52.230
<v Speaker 2>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just done doing drugs and alcohol and,</v>

2484
01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:53.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took them to treatment.</v>

2485
01:39:53.851 --> 01:39:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2486
01:39:54.301 --> 01:39:56.730
<v Speaker 2>if this guy can get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wasn't doing,</v>

2487
01:39:58.110 --> 01:39:59.310
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't that bad,</v>

2488
01:39:59.311 --> 01:40:00.610
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't have hookers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2489
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:03.540
<v Speaker 2>at least I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did they do for you?</v>

2490
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:09.550
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the process of getting someone </v>

2491
01:40:09.550 --> 01:40:10.380
<v Speaker 2>to get 95 percent of people staying </v>
<v Speaker 2>clean?</v>

2492
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:13.080
<v Speaker 2>First part is a separation from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

2493
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just being away from drugs and </v>

2494
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.550
<v Speaker 2>alcohol I think like Aa is a great </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

2495
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:20.070
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I would have went to an AA meeting,</v>

2496
01:40:20.071 --> 01:40:21.510
<v Speaker 2>I would have went home and drank that </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

2497
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I needed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me,</v>

2498
01:40:23.131 --> 01:40:25.830
<v Speaker 2>I needed to be in a place where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't get isolated.</v>

2499
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:30.000
<v Speaker 2>I needed to be isolated from it for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little while to get away from it.</v>

2500
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main,</v>

2501
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:33.150
<v Speaker 2>the main thing was therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all therapeutic.</v>

2502
01:40:33.151 --> 01:40:38.151
<v Speaker 2>It's all like group therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes sit in a group with people that </v>

2503
01:40:38.151 --> 01:40:39.550
<v Speaker 2>are fucked up and you talk about your </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems and in a,</v>

2504
01:40:39.551 --> 01:40:43.590
<v Speaker 2>in a good facility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had such good counselors there that</v>

2505
01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.940
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

2506
01:40:44.941 --> 01:40:49.941
<v Speaker 2>like it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more about like being loved </v>

2507
01:40:49.941 --> 01:40:49.941
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling part of your,</v>

2508
01:40:49.941 --> 01:40:51.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved to La and I was on my own.</v>

2509
01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 2>I moved to La when I was 19 years from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from New York.</v>

2510
01:40:54.161 --> 01:40:56.800
<v Speaker 2>My whole family was back east.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother moved out here,</v>

2511
01:40:56.801 --> 01:41:01.801
<v Speaker 2>eventually my older brother moved out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>here eventually and eventually my </v>

2512
01:41:01.801 --> 01:41:01.801
<v Speaker 2>parents moved out here and we do have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>close family too.</v>

2513
01:41:01.801 --> 01:41:06.570
<v Speaker 2>We have a really close family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to be away from your family and this </v>

2514
01:41:06.570 --> 01:41:09.760
<v Speaker 2>whole time and not feel like any love </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the world is a tough thing,</v>

2515
01:41:09.761 --> 01:41:14.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like a lot of people don't really </v>

2516
01:41:14.761 --> 01:41:14.761
<v Speaker 2>express that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2517
01:41:14.761 --> 01:41:14.761
<v Speaker 2>might sound kind of wimpy or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

2518
01:41:14.761 --> 01:41:15.040
<v Speaker 2>But it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>

2519
01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:20.060
<v Speaker 2>there was no feeling of comfort or </v>
<v Speaker 2>safety or security in anything that I,</v>

2520
01:41:20.710 --> 01:41:25.710
<v Speaker 2>that I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like regaining that through being </v>

2521
01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:29.281
<v Speaker 2>around people with like minded </v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences and there's just some </v>

2522
01:41:29.281 --> 01:41:31.120
<v Speaker 2>counselors there that will break you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2523
01:41:31.150 --> 01:41:32.740
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's people that go there,</v>

2524
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:38.070
<v Speaker 2>hardcore heroin addicts that like will </v>
<v Speaker 2>sit there and in group therapy and not </v>

2525
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:40.190
<v Speaker 2>want to be analyzed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2526
01:41:40.630 --> 01:41:43.360
<v Speaker 2>and these guys don't break them down </v>
<v Speaker 2>until they're,</v>

2527
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:45.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>punching pillows and shit saying this is</v>

2528
01:41:45.851 --> 01:41:48.580
<v Speaker 2>my father and fucking piece of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2529
01:41:49.330 --> 01:41:50.170
<v Speaker 2>that's how it goes.</v>

2530
01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:51.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a really intense,</v>

2531
01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.720
<v Speaker 2>a therapeutic thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2532
01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.890
<v Speaker 2>that allows you to see yourself in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>different way and it's a very humbling.</v>

2533
01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.990
<v Speaker 2>The number one thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2534
01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:05.560
<v Speaker 2>the number one thing that I had on my </v>
<v Speaker 2>side was a desperation to get better.</v>

2535
01:42:06.030 --> 01:42:07.750
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the fucked up parts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the film.</v>

2536
01:42:07.751 --> 01:42:08.260
<v Speaker 2>Bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

2537
01:42:08.261 --> 01:42:13.261
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was Your Dad saying they knew that your </v>

2538
01:42:13.261 --> 01:42:15.391
<v Speaker 2>older brother was going to die that way </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to go through that and then have </v>

2539
01:42:16.091 --> 01:42:21.091
<v Speaker 2>your brother die that way and then for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to get hooked on pills yourself </v>

2540
01:42:21.091 --> 01:42:23.240
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hadn't been a helpless feeling.</v>

2541
01:42:23.241 --> 01:42:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Like that's why I felt like I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell anybody.</v>

2542
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:30.870
<v Speaker 2>So I went to my parents and I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>an interview with them and I really </v>

2543
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:31.270
<v Speaker 2>wanted to tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I was like,</v>

2544
01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:32.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I can tell them.</v>

2545
01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:37.390
<v Speaker 2>So early on in the movie before I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before I had relapsed,</v>

2546
01:42:37.391 --> 01:42:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2547
01:42:37.781 --> 01:42:39.220
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a problem with this.</v>

2548
01:42:39.850 --> 01:42:41.320
<v Speaker 2>My mom cries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

2549
01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:42.280
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't you tell me?</v>

2550
01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:43.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how am I supposed to tell you?</v>

2551
01:42:43.451 --> 01:42:48.451
<v Speaker 2>You just lost a son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you like I'm going to </v>

2552
01:42:48.451 --> 01:42:48.451
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2553
01:42:48.451 --> 01:42:50.200
<v Speaker 2>next year you're going to worry about me</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm not there.</v>

2554
01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:55.320
<v Speaker 2>You know what is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can try to describe what is the </v>

2555
01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:57.220
<v Speaker 2>feeling like when you want to take that </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

2556
01:42:57.490 --> 01:42:59.620
<v Speaker 2>when you want to take a pain pill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what?</v>

2557
01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:01.240
<v Speaker 2>What is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no feeling.</v>

2558
01:43:01.241 --> 01:43:01.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2559
01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:04.360
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the addicts fault.</v>

2560
01:43:04.630 --> 01:43:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Like you might have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2561
01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.330
<v Speaker 2>friends or people that you know that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to just wake up and stop drinking.</v>

2562
01:43:10.331 --> 01:43:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Well you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not your fault anymore.</v>

2563
01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:13.960
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a pathway,</v>

2564
01:43:13.961 --> 01:43:15.160
<v Speaker 2>a neurological pathway.</v>

2565
01:43:15.340 --> 01:43:17.310
<v Speaker 2>You just talked about before Brock </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lesnar,</v>

2566
01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.070
<v Speaker 2>somebody got a hold of them and built </v>
<v Speaker 2>those punches and kicks into his system.</v>

2567
01:43:21.071 --> 01:43:26.071
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes ingrained and built in your </v>

2568
01:43:26.071 --> 01:43:28.681
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It becomes a neurological pathway in </v>

2569
01:43:28.681 --> 01:43:30.070
<v Speaker 2>your brain and you tend to habituate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that make you feel good.</v>

2570
01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:35.670
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just something that an addict </v>

2571
01:43:35.670 --> 01:43:37.741
<v Speaker 2>will do more so than other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying that this is very distinct</v>

2572
01:43:37.781 --> 01:43:39.460
<v Speaker 2>black and white thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not the,</v>

2573
01:43:39.461 --> 01:43:40.900
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the addicts fault,</v>

2574
01:43:40.901 --> 01:43:45.490
<v Speaker 2>but the addict has to be sober first </v>
<v Speaker 2>before they can get fucked up.</v>

2575
01:43:45.491 --> 01:43:46.540
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're sober,</v>

2576
01:43:47.110 --> 01:43:49.090
<v Speaker 2>you're sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a conscious mind,</v>

2577
01:43:49.300 --> 01:43:53.090
<v Speaker 2>you're aware of your actions and decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take a pain pill.</v>

2578
01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:56.150
<v Speaker 2>How is that not the addicts fault?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're already addicted?</v>

2579
01:43:56.151 --> 01:43:58.160
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an automatic thing.</v>

2580
01:43:58.161 --> 01:44:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Your body feels like it needs it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2581
01:44:00.170 --> 01:44:02.210
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're an addicted maybe because he never</v>

2582
01:44:02.211 --> 01:44:03.270
<v Speaker 2>got actual treatment.</v>

2583
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.760
<v Speaker 2>How do you get addicted in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

2584
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:07.280
<v Speaker 2>but you weren't because you were off of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it for a long time.</v>

2585
01:44:07.281 --> 01:44:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it wasn't like he had this mad need,</v>

2586
01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:12.350
<v Speaker 2>like your bones were aching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had to get that.</v>

2587
01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:16.280
<v Speaker 2>I think you switched to alcohol I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>is kind of the part that you're at.</v>

2588
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:21.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I switched to alcohol like instead of </v>

2589
01:44:21.490 --> 01:44:21.490
<v Speaker 2>having pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I always had something.</v>

2590
01:44:21.490 --> 01:44:23.190
<v Speaker 2>So you get the double hip replacement </v>
<v Speaker 2>surgery.</v>

2591
01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:25.850
<v Speaker 2>So you did your documentary bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>

2592
01:44:25.851 --> 01:44:29.510
<v Speaker 2>faster was 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right after that,</v>

2593
01:44:29.511 --> 01:44:31.190
<v Speaker 2>2009.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when are you talking about?</v>

2594
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:33.170
<v Speaker 2>You're getting your hip replaced in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2009.</v>

2595
01:44:33.171 --> 01:44:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six years ago.</v>

2596
01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:38.720
<v Speaker 2>And then how you get off the shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our 2007.</v>

2597
01:44:38.721 --> 01:44:43.721
<v Speaker 2>I actually got to replace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it done before we finished the </v>

2598
01:44:43.721 --> 01:44:43.721
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2599
01:44:43.721 --> 01:44:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you did 2017.</v>

2600
01:44:44.190 --> 01:44:45.980
<v Speaker 2>But then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then I didn't mention this.</v>

2601
01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:48.710
<v Speaker 2>So then I had um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my hip,</v>

2602
01:44:48.711 --> 01:44:50.450
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said they had complications.</v>

2603
01:44:50.790 --> 01:44:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to Redo my hip.</v>

2604
01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:54.300
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So two years later they,</v>

2605
01:44:54.330 --> 01:44:57.580
<v Speaker 2>we did it in 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They redid my right hip.</v>

2606
01:44:57.710 --> 01:45:00.590
<v Speaker 2>They completely took it out and put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>back together.</v>

2607
01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw it.</v>

2608
01:45:03.050 --> 01:45:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some messed up parts in there </v>

2609
01:45:08.050 --> 01:45:08.420
<v Speaker 2>that they have to unscrew that thing </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think they left that.</v>

2610
01:45:08.421 --> 01:45:13.421
<v Speaker 2>I think that was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the other part that was </v>

2611
01:45:13.421 --> 01:45:15.611
<v Speaker 2>messed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then a month after I had that hip </v>

2612
01:45:15.611 --> 01:45:15.611
<v Speaker 2>surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my brother died,</v>

2613
01:45:15.700 --> 01:45:17.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just tough.</v>

2614
01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:18.560
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2615
01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:23.561
<v Speaker 2>it's like you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can power through that stuff if you </v>

2616
01:45:23.561 --> 01:45:27.281
<v Speaker 2>have the tools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I didn't have any tools to stay </v>

2617
01:45:27.281 --> 01:45:30.791
<v Speaker 2>sober or let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get the hip replacement surgery </v>

2618
01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:31.400
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get hooked on pills,</v>

2619
01:45:31.401 --> 01:45:36.401
<v Speaker 2>then you get off pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but two years later they want to reopen </v>

2620
01:45:36.401 --> 01:45:36.401
<v Speaker 2>you up.</v>

2621
01:45:36.401 --> 01:45:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Do you take pills again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And got back on pills for how long?</v>

2622
01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:42.200
<v Speaker 2>About another two years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2623
01:45:42.670 --> 01:45:45.590
<v Speaker 2>and then what happened was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so then I went I fucking years.</v>

2624
01:45:45.591 --> 01:45:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then I went back to uh,</v>

2625
01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:53.200
<v Speaker 2>to try to get off the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I knew I needed to get off the </v>

2626
01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:53.200
<v Speaker 2>pillow long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where you want them for the first time.</v>

2627
01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:55.780
<v Speaker 2>The first time when you had the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem a I was on them almost.</v>

2628
01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:58.370
<v Speaker 2>I was on them for like a year and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>got off of him,</v>

2629
01:45:58.890 --> 01:45:59.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for how long,</v>

2630
01:46:00.110 --> 01:46:05.110
<v Speaker 2>but I only got off them for a couple </v>
<v Speaker 2>months and I had the second surgery </v>

2631
01:46:05.110 --> 01:46:06.440
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was a really gotten off of them.</v>

2632
01:46:06.570 --> 01:46:07.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a really up and down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks.</v>

2633
01:46:07.671 --> 01:46:12.210
<v Speaker 2>So the drug called suboxone and suboxone</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of mimics the way that a painkiller</v>

2634
01:46:12.230 --> 01:46:14.040
<v Speaker 2>will feel in your body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2635
01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:15.680
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have.</v>

2636
01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:18.020
<v Speaker 2>Well it doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't get you high.</v>

2637
01:46:18.380 --> 01:46:20.660
<v Speaker 2>It'll just basically making it not feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>sick.</v>

2638
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:22.940
<v Speaker 2>So that's the biggest problem is </v>
<v Speaker 2>withdrawals.</v>

2639
01:46:22.941 --> 01:46:25.610
<v Speaker 2>You feel so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the flu times 100.</v>

2640
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:30.910
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is that when you're coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of them and you want to get on </v>

2641
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.980
<v Speaker 2>suboxone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my,</v>

2642
01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:35.300
<v Speaker 2>my insurance would cover all the pills </v>
<v Speaker 2>so there was 10 bucks a pop,</v>

2643
01:46:35.710 --> 01:46:40.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 bucks for like 180 pills of percocet </v>

2644
01:46:40.710 --> 01:46:42.710
<v Speaker 2>or vicodin or whatever the drug I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken when I wanted to get off of them,</v>

2645
01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:47.980
<v Speaker 2>I had to consult with a doctor every </v>
<v Speaker 2>month for $250 and I had to pay about </v>

2646
01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:51.390
<v Speaker 2>225 to $250.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The drug and insurance doesn't cover any</v>

2647
01:46:51.391 --> 01:46:53.550
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't cover you getting better,</v>

2648
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:56.070
<v Speaker 2>they only cover you doing the dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>

2649
01:46:57.490 --> 01:46:59.010
<v Speaker 2>That's another brutal thing on top of </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2650
01:46:59.011 --> 01:47:01.350
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then suboxone I think that is.</v>

2651
01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:03.300
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's built into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>

2652
01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:06.090
<v Speaker 2>Do they sell more drugs built into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>

2653
01:47:06.091 --> 01:47:08.370
<v Speaker 2>So that's a scary thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's true.</v>

2654
01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they absolutely like if you look at</v>

2655
01:47:11.311 --> 01:47:11.920
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to.</v>

2656
01:47:11.940 --> 01:47:13.410
<v Speaker 2>If it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2657
01:47:13.740 --> 01:47:15.510
<v Speaker 2>like yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take painkillers,</v>

2658
01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:18.930
<v Speaker 2>it's your fault for getting addicted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>

2659
01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:21.450
<v Speaker 2>But if you actually look at the history </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Oxycontin,</v>

2660
01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:26.660
<v Speaker 2>that drug was designed to hook people on</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's basically very similar to heroin.</v>

2661
01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:27.750
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2662
01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:28.440
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

2663
01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:32.730
<v Speaker 2>the drug company that makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that made it purdue pharmaceuticals,</v>

2664
01:47:33.180 --> 01:47:34.890
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lied,</v>

2665
01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:36.000
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2666
01:47:36.001 --> 01:47:38.400
<v Speaker 2>they made $8,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this drug,</v>

2667
01:47:38.670 --> 01:47:40.020
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>$8,000,000,000.</v>

2668
01:47:40.260 --> 01:47:42.390
<v Speaker 2>And then they had to pay a fine of </v>
<v Speaker 2>$2,000,000,000.</v>

2669
01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:43.640
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the profit,</v>

2670
01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:48.660
<v Speaker 2>still $6,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They call it the price of doing </v>

2671
01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:48.660
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2672
01:47:48.660 --> 01:47:50.790
<v Speaker 2>so they lied and said that you will not </v>
<v Speaker 2>get addicted using this drug.</v>

2673
01:47:51.090 --> 01:47:56.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got the whole country addicted to </v>

2674
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.090
<v Speaker 2>this drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2675
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.220
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people should all be in prison.</v>

2676
01:47:56.910 --> 01:48:01.910
<v Speaker 2>They got the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole country addicted to a drug </v>

2677
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.910
<v Speaker 2>that's made for like severe cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>patients,</v>

2678
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:03.850
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of stuff is,</v>

2679
01:48:03.890 --> 01:48:05.550
<v Speaker 2>is this criminal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people go like,</v>

2680
01:48:05.551 --> 01:48:06.630
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you should have known.</v>

2681
01:48:06.631 --> 01:48:10.200
<v Speaker 2>It's like most people don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we're making a movie.</v>

2682
01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:11.250
<v Speaker 2>To have awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2683
01:48:11.400 --> 01:48:14.430
<v Speaker 2>for these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is really fresh for you.</v>

2684
01:48:14.431 --> 01:48:19.320
<v Speaker 2>This is not something that you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome a long time ago.</v>

2685
01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:19.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2686
01:48:19.951 --> 01:48:22.440
<v Speaker 2>I still go to meetings and I still stay </v>
<v Speaker 2>up on it.</v>

2687
01:48:22.441 --> 01:48:25.020
<v Speaker 2>I think every day you need to remind </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself that you can go back there.</v>

2688
01:48:25.140 --> 01:48:27.650
<v Speaker 2>So you're 100 percent sober now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't fuck with no.</v>

2689
01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

2690
01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:33.870
<v Speaker 2>So the feeling that you get like when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

2691
01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:38.960
<v Speaker 2>when you have this relapse with a Xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feeling that you get,</v>

2692
01:48:39.420 --> 01:48:41.370
<v Speaker 2>is it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just feel helpless?</v>

2693
01:48:41.370 --> 01:48:43.740
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel just pulled to it?</v>

2694
01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's pulling?</v>

2695
01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>

2696
01:48:47.371 --> 01:48:52.320
<v Speaker 2>so xanax was a drug that would help me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would drink a lot,</v>

2697
01:48:52.650 --> 01:48:57.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I wasn't because because I was an </v>

2698
01:48:57.650 --> 01:48:58.260
<v Speaker 2>addict why he'd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'd kind of drank to the point where,</v>

2699
01:48:58.370 --> 01:49:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a compromising the next day type </v>

2700
01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:05.781
<v Speaker 2>of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then also you ended up in the </v>

2701
01:49:05.781 --> 01:49:05.781
<v Speaker 2>hospital a couple of times from </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking.</v>

2702
01:49:05.781 --> 01:49:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say serious bouts of drinking,</v>

2703
01:49:06.961 --> 01:49:09.420
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't like he really knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I went to the,</v>

2704
01:49:09.690 --> 01:49:13.530
<v Speaker 2>to the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urgent care or emergency room I think 10</v>

2705
01:49:13.531 --> 01:49:16.730
<v Speaker 2>times within a matter of like 20 days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

2706
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:21.830
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I go to urgent care and I'd go </v>

2707
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:22.650
<v Speaker 2>get xanax because I had a hangover so </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad because I would drink so much,</v>

2708
01:49:22.710 --> 01:49:25.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was continuous like every day.</v>

2709
01:49:25.590 --> 01:49:28.110
<v Speaker 2>So for me it became,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became a labor.</v>

2710
01:49:28.140 --> 01:49:30.270
<v Speaker 2>It became like everyday I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2711
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this cat chasing its tail.</v>

2712
01:49:32.601 --> 01:49:37.601
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ever get better or feel better at </v>

2713
01:49:37.601 --> 01:49:38.220
<v Speaker 2>first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You weren't drinking that often though,</v>

2714
01:49:38.221 --> 01:49:39.460
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2715
01:49:39.510 --> 01:49:41.740
<v Speaker 2>at first it was like every three days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days,</v>

2716
01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:43.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about it,</v>

2717
01:49:43.261 --> 01:49:45.720
<v Speaker 2>power lifting and everything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were sports guys,</v>

2718
01:49:45.721 --> 01:49:47.890
<v Speaker 2>like we were never into drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were never into drugs.</v>

2719
01:49:47.891 --> 01:49:48.060
<v Speaker 2>Like</v>

2720
01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:50.470
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't something even on my radar </v>
<v Speaker 3>when I did bigger,</v>

2721
01:49:50.471 --> 01:49:51.070
<v Speaker 3>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>faster,</v>

2722
01:49:51.071 --> 01:49:52.360
<v Speaker 3>I would drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2723
01:49:52.361 --> 01:49:57.361
<v Speaker 3>here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I should have known back then </v>

2724
01:49:57.361 --> 01:50:00.661
<v Speaker 3>because like when I did drink it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>like binge drinking and that's when you </v>

2725
01:50:00.661 --> 01:50:03.541
<v Speaker 3>know that you'll probably have a problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere down the road if you're the </v>

2726
01:50:03.541 --> 01:50:05.230
<v Speaker 3>guy that drinks and you got the guy that</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinks once a month,</v>

2727
01:50:05.231 --> 01:50:08.380
<v Speaker 3>but you get completely hammered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that you might have a problem.</v>

2728
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:13.470
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't the guy that could ever put it </v>

2729
01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:13.470
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how,</v>

2730
01:50:13.470 --> 01:50:16.380
<v Speaker 3>what does it feel like to make a </v>
<v Speaker 3>documentary about prescription drugs </v>

2731
01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:16.450
<v Speaker 3>while you're hooked on prescription </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs?</v>

2732
01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:21.670
<v Speaker 3>A guilty really guilty the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I had raised the money to do it.</v>

2733
01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:24.760
<v Speaker 3>That was moving forward with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Had a bunch of people involved.</v>

2734
01:50:24.761 --> 01:50:26.230
<v Speaker 3>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck do I tell?</v>

2735
01:50:26.830 --> 01:50:31.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in this weird situation where </v>

2736
01:50:31.830 --> 01:50:34.201
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a hypocrite but I can't stop what I </v>

<v Speaker 3>just stopped doing this and pull the </v>
<v Speaker 3>plug and I have people working for me.</v>

2738
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:39.340
<v Speaker 3>People editing the film.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A partner Greg young was there since the</v>

2739
01:50:39.341 --> 01:50:40.920
<v Speaker 3>very beginning and he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2740
01:50:41.230 --> 01:50:46.230
<v Speaker 3>he knew what was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't know was going to do to </v>

2741
01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:46.900
<v Speaker 3>like pull the plug on his own job and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2742

<v Speaker 3>he didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he cared about me and wanted to help me,</v>

2743
01:50:50.230 --> 01:50:52.150
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't know how to help me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2744
01:50:52.151 --> 01:50:55.180
<v Speaker 3>how much of a part of the film does this</v>
<v Speaker 3>become a,</v>

2745
01:50:55.470 --> 01:50:57.010
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of a,</v>

2746
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:58.900
<v Speaker 3>towards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>towards the end.</v>

2747
01:50:59.170 --> 01:51:00.570
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of like in the,</v>

2748
01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:02.470
<v Speaker 3>in the third act of the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2749
01:51:02.471 --> 01:51:05.140
<v Speaker 3>we sort of discuss it and go into it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2750
01:51:05.141 --> 01:51:10.141
<v Speaker 3>we didn't go into a whole lot about </v>
<v Speaker 3>recovery because of the movie isn't </v>

2751
01:51:10.141 --> 01:51:10.270
<v Speaker 3>really about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but anyway,</v>

2752
01:51:10.271 --> 01:51:11.110
<v Speaker 3>by the end of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2753
01:51:11.111 --> 01:51:11.620
<v Speaker 3>I'm okay.</v>

2754
01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:15.550
<v Speaker 3>And if a whole quarter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a whole quarter of a year,</v>

2755
01:51:16.150 --> 01:51:17.140
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2756
01:51:17.141 --> 01:51:19.930
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they take you away from society for very</v>

2757
01:51:19.931 --> 01:51:21.510
<v Speaker 3>few people can afford to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2758
01:51:21.520 --> 01:51:23.470
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what happened was,</v>

2759
01:51:23.471 --> 01:51:25.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I feel this,</v>

2760
01:51:25.451 --> 01:51:29.650
<v Speaker 3>I feel almost everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if they could unplug from their life for</v>

2761
01:51:29.651 --> 01:51:32.440
<v Speaker 3>like 30 days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like 10 days,</v>

2762
01:51:32.650 --> 01:51:35.660
<v Speaker 3>like people go on vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still bring your phone and stuff.</v>

2763
01:51:35.680 --> 01:51:40.680
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people around them that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>know and it's supposed to be in that </v>

2764
01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:43.411
<v Speaker 3>environment of solitude is just like an </v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing feeling that I'm though dark.</v>

2765
01:51:44.120 --> 01:51:44.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2766
01:51:44.970 --> 01:51:47.340
<v Speaker 3>Going dark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happened to me was in the,</v>

2767
01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:50.680
<v Speaker 3>so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how they helped me and um,</v>

2768
01:51:50.770 --> 01:51:54.930
<v Speaker 3>I could tell you that I think part of it</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big huge part of it and they've talked</v>

2769
01:51:54.931 --> 01:51:57.520
<v Speaker 3>about like Aa and all these other </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs and everything ever talks about</v>

2770
01:51:57.521 --> 01:51:58.540
<v Speaker 3>a spiritual awakening.</v>

2771
01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:03.700
<v Speaker 3>So the third day that I was in Rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went and took a shower and it was like</v>

2772
01:52:04.090 --> 01:52:05.410
<v Speaker 3>4:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the morning or something.</v>

2773
01:52:05.411 --> 01:52:07.240
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't sleep or anything.</v>

2774
01:52:07.241 --> 01:52:11.380
<v Speaker 3>And I went in the shower and I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>cried for like three hours.</v>

2775
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:14.440
<v Speaker 3>The fuck am I doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to USC film school,</v>

2776
01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:16.120
<v Speaker 3>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did all the right things.</v>

2777
01:52:16.150 --> 01:52:18.310
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I trained my whole life.</v>

2778
01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:23.580
<v Speaker 3>I did everything the right way and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking blowing it and that's what got </v>

2779
01:52:23.580 --> 01:52:24.220
<v Speaker 3>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2780
01:52:24.221 --> 01:52:26.740
<v Speaker 3>it was my self that got to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>

2781
01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:28.450
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't anybody else really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2782
01:52:28.690 --> 01:52:31.960
<v Speaker 3>another thing that happened to them in </v>
<v Speaker 3>treatment was a cliff side.</v>

2783
01:52:31.961 --> 01:52:34.810
<v Speaker 3>Malibu is beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 3>multimillion dollar facility.</v>

2784
01:52:34.811 --> 01:52:36.790
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really nice.</v>

2785
01:52:36.791 --> 01:52:38.650
<v Speaker 3>It's in fucking Malibu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>

2786
01:52:38.651 --> 01:52:42.040
<v Speaker 3>which is beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think once you were there for like</v>

2787
01:52:42.041 --> 01:52:47.041
<v Speaker 3>two weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they took you away from there and three </v>

2788
01:52:47.041 --> 01:52:47.041
<v Speaker 3>and some shit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2789
01:52:47.041 --> 01:52:47.041
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What happened was that,</v>

2790
01:52:47.041 --> 01:52:51.460
<v Speaker 2>so I was there for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally think it's all part of the </v>

2791
01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:51.460
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

2792
01:52:51.460 --> 01:52:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was there for 10 days and um,</v>

2793
01:52:52.050 --> 01:52:53.900
<v Speaker 2>and after 10 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2794
01:52:53.901 --> 01:52:55.990
<v Speaker 2>I was being helped by the facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

2795
01:52:56.030 --> 01:52:57.530
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were funding it.</v>

2796
01:52:57.531 --> 01:52:59.030
<v Speaker 2>They were helping me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2797
01:52:59.031 --> 01:53:00.980
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since they were helping me out because I</v>

2798
01:53:00.981 --> 01:53:04.450
<v Speaker 2>was part of this movie and the guy just </v>
<v Speaker 2>had compassion for me,</v>

2799
01:53:04.460 --> 01:53:06.200
<v Speaker 2>Richard Tate and wanted to see me get </v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

2800
01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:11.230
<v Speaker 2>The guy was suspicious that you had a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem when you came here the first </v>

2801
01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:11.230
<v Speaker 2>time to interview them anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

2802
01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:11.840
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2803
01:53:12.260 --> 01:53:17.260
<v Speaker 2>so he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can't afford to keep you here </v>

2804
01:53:17.260 --> 01:53:19.601
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 60 grand a month to go to that </v>

2805
01:53:19.601 --> 01:53:19.601
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>

2806
01:53:19.601 --> 01:53:20.400
<v Speaker 2>a lot of insurance covers it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2807
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:21.550
<v Speaker 2>and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2808
01:53:21.620 --> 01:53:25.120
<v Speaker 2>insurance covers that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It depends on your double scam.</v>

2809
01:53:25.120 --> 01:53:27.550
<v Speaker 2>So it's the fucking insurance covers </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they may go.</v>

2810
01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:33.660
<v Speaker 2>It's all part of the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all part of the system in some </v>

2811
01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:34.060
<v Speaker 2>box money for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2812
01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:38.000
<v Speaker 2>So it's hard to come up with that money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need money for that.</v>

2813
01:53:38.180 --> 01:53:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2814
01:53:39.081 --> 01:53:44.081
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they have the money for the </v>

2815
01:53:44.081 --> 01:53:44.081
<v Speaker 2>treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

2816
01:53:44.081 --> 01:53:44.081
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw you in this place.</v>

2817
01:53:44.081 --> 01:53:47.711
<v Speaker 2>That's not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was I went to a place </v>

2818
01:53:47.711 --> 01:53:50.711
<v Speaker 2>called Claire Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in Santa Monica and it's very </v>

2819
01:53:50.711 --> 01:53:50.990
<v Speaker 2>industrial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

2820
01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:55.110
<v Speaker 2>it's a government run Rehab facility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2821
01:53:55.190 --> 01:54:00.190
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I walked in there and saw this </v>

2822
01:54:00.190 --> 01:54:02.030
<v Speaker 2>guy with no teeth and he was scratching </v>
<v Speaker 2>his nuts and he's like,</v>

2823
01:54:02.031 --> 01:54:05.060
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to like it in here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pillows are really tough,</v>

2824
01:54:05.250 --> 01:54:07.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I walk in,</v>

2825
01:54:07.041 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the fuck do you sleep in here?</v>

2826
01:54:08.631 --> 01:54:10.100
<v Speaker 2>And I'm looking and there's all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunk beds.</v>

2827
01:54:10.100 --> 01:54:11.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well where's my room?</v>

2828
01:54:11.870 --> 01:54:12.380
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2829
01:54:12.381 --> 01:54:17.381
<v Speaker 2>there is no room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one big room with 40 bunk beds and </v>

2830
01:54:17.381 --> 01:54:18.760
<v Speaker 2>40 grown men and 39 of them just got out</v>
<v Speaker 2>of jail and you're the only one.</v>

2831
01:54:18.761 --> 01:54:20.690
<v Speaker 2>It's normal kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2832
01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:25.700
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of a facility like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas this is something out of like </v>

2833
01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:29.150
<v Speaker 2>one flew over the cuckoo's nest and when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put me in there that was like,</v>

2834
01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:31.910
<v Speaker 2>fuck this man this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2835
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I know like a lot of addicts will say </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2836
01:54:33.651 --> 01:54:38.651
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like that and I'm not like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was something that was so far </v>

2837
01:54:38.651 --> 01:54:42.401
<v Speaker 2>fetched from where I would ever find </v>
<v Speaker 2>myself in my life so far down that I was</v>

2838
01:54:43.161 --> 01:54:43.910
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck this,</v>

2839
01:54:43.911 --> 01:54:48.911
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting Outta here and this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never going to drink or do a drug </v>

2840
01:54:48.911 --> 01:54:49.430
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it'll hopefully,</v>

2841
01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:50.960
<v Speaker 2>hopefully you can stick to that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2842
01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have any urges to anymore.</v>

2843
01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:58.070
<v Speaker 2>But it was that facility that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that really cemented it,</v>

2844
01:54:58.071 --> 01:55:00.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that's the only 10 days,</v>

2845
01:55:00.111 --> 01:55:05.111
<v Speaker 2>so why I was in that facility for 19 </v>
<v Speaker 2>days and it was like about 10 days in 10</v>

2846
01:55:05.391 --> 01:55:06.310
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>days,</v>

2847
01:55:07.190 --> 01:55:08.930
<v Speaker 2>19 days there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2848
01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:14.050
<v Speaker 2>and then when I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they had ruined for me back at </v>

2849
01:55:14.050 --> 01:55:17.921
<v Speaker 2>cliffside and it ended up going back to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Malibu and like living out the rest of </v>

2850
01:55:17.921 --> 01:55:21.461
<v Speaker 2>it in Malibu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was really nice about that was </v>

2851
01:55:21.461 --> 01:55:23.861
<v Speaker 2>I was still able to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I was going to treatment every day </v>

2852
01:55:23.861 --> 01:55:26.250
<v Speaker 2>for three hours in the morning and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>I would drive to la and I would,</v>

2853
01:55:26.270 --> 01:55:27.860
<v Speaker 2>I would work on the movie the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

2854
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:31.490
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty twisted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it all worked out,</v>

2855
01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:36.491
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you pretty much feel like you were </v>

2856
01:55:36.491 --> 01:55:36.491
<v Speaker 2>done after you went to that shit hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2857
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:41.530
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you just felt like you needed more </v>

2858
01:55:41.530 --> 01:55:41.530
<v Speaker 2>treatment to cement it is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the thought process,</v>

2859
01:55:41.530 --> 01:55:41.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2860
01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:43.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard.</v>

2861
01:55:43.711 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>It's hard</v>

2862
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.140
<v Speaker 3>to explain to people that haven't been </v>
<v Speaker 3>through it.</v>

2863
01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:47.710
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people have been through it.</v>

2864
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:53.000
<v Speaker 3>They know what it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but addiction addiction is one of the </v>

2865
01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.410
<v Speaker 3>most powerful forces in this universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the,</v>

2866
01:55:55.730 --> 01:56:00.120
<v Speaker 3>it's something that drives people </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday to do bad shit,</v>

2867
01:56:00.230 --> 01:56:02.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and continued support,</v>

2868
01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:03.870
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2869
01:56:03.871 --> 01:56:05.430
<v Speaker 3>You basically just need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2870
01:56:05.730 --> 01:56:09.060
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a lot of it's set off by trauma,</v>

2871
01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:12.150
<v Speaker 3>like things that happened in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of it's uh,</v>

2872
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:17.480
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't really have that like one </v>

2873
01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:17.480
<v Speaker 3>main trauma that like set it off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People go,</v>

2874
01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:18.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brother died.</v>

2875
01:56:18.121 --> 01:56:18.810
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that was,</v>

2876
01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:21.230
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't as dramatic as it sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It.</v>

2877
01:56:21.340 --> 01:56:24.540
<v Speaker 3>Of course it's a traumatic but.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I was,</v>

2878
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:27.090
<v Speaker 3>I was doing stuff before that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what was before that?</v>

2879
01:56:27.091 --> 01:56:29.730
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe the hip surgery didn't seem to me.</v>

2880
01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:34.940
<v Speaker 3>I think a big part of it for me was </v>
<v Speaker 3>having the hip surgery took away </v>

2881
01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:35.910
<v Speaker 3>something that I really loved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was like lifting,</v>

2882
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:37.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that like,</v>

2883
01:56:37.321 --> 01:56:39.660
<v Speaker 3>if you couldn't fight anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd fucking hate it.</v>

2884
01:56:39.810 --> 01:56:40.880
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like bombed,</v>

2885
01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:46.100
<v Speaker 3>grumpy because there was a part of it </v>
<v Speaker 3>just in your everyday life and now it's </v>

2886
01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:46.100
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2887
01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:46.740
<v Speaker 3>and it might sound stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's part is,</v>

2888
01:56:46.741 --> 01:56:47.880
<v Speaker 3>it's something that you do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2889
01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.020
<v Speaker 3>if I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey joe,</v>

2891
01:56:50.610 --> 01:56:53.220

<v Speaker 3>So you just felt like just a giant loss.</v>

2892
01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:58.280
<v Speaker 3>You just felt like something was missing</v>
<v Speaker 3>from your life and that's what led you </v>

2893
01:56:58.280 --> 01:56:59.160
<v Speaker 3>to just start getting fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill it in with other stuff,</v>

2894
01:56:59.161 --> 01:57:00.570
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 3>trying something healthy and trying to </v>

2896
01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:08.580
<v Speaker 3>engineer your life and sort of a way or </v>
<v Speaker 3>we do something.</v>

2897
01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:10.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you take away working out what's</v>

2898
01:57:10.831 --> 01:57:13.430
<v Speaker 3>healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you couldn't do any working out?</v>

2899
01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:15.480
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not a whole lot.</v>

2900
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:17.750
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not like I used to and now that long,</v>

2901
01:57:18.690 --> 01:57:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean just just for like years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

2902
01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:21.590
<v Speaker 3>I just felt shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2903
01:57:21.630 --> 01:57:23.750
<v Speaker 3>I just didn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the hips.</v>

2904
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:26.310
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he also felt lonely too.</v>

2905
01:57:26.311 --> 01:57:27.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2906
01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:27.570
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2907
01:57:27.590 --> 01:57:32.590
<v Speaker 3>he didn't have her until more recently </v>
<v Speaker 3>and even though our family is in </v>

2908
01:57:32.590 --> 01:57:33.470
<v Speaker 3>California,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2909
01:57:33.570 --> 01:57:37.020
<v Speaker 3>I have two children,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so our parents moved to this.</v>

2910
01:57:37.350 --> 01:57:39.720
<v Speaker 3>They were from New York originally.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They moved to California,</v>

2911
01:57:39.721 --> 01:57:44.721
<v Speaker 3>but we all live in northern California </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when it came to like holidays and </v>

2912
01:57:44.721 --> 01:57:48.441
<v Speaker 3>some different things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we'd call them and communicate </v>

2913
01:57:48.441 --> 01:57:48.441
<v Speaker 3>with them a little bit here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2914
01:57:48.441 --> 01:57:49.830
<v Speaker 3>he kind of just seemed like he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>give a fuck about.</v>

2915
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Still in upstate New York.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know he's here.</v>

2916
01:57:53.160 --> 01:57:53.940
<v Speaker 3>He's in La.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2917
01:57:54.570 --> 01:57:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he was only in La and we were in </v>

2918
01:57:59.570 --> 01:57:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Sacramento but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't,</v>

2919
01:57:59.570 --> 01:57:59.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not that far.</v>

2920
01:57:59.570 --> 01:58:03.710
<v Speaker 3>It's one hour flight or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But we'd communicate with them here and </v>

2921
01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:03.710
<v Speaker 3>there and just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2922
01:58:03.710 --> 01:58:06.150
<v Speaker 3>even like on his birthday or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>call them or whatever the case might be.</v>

2923
01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:11.210
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then he would come up to Sacramento </v>

2924
01:58:11.210 --> 01:58:11.640
<v Speaker 3>or I'd come down here and we'd meet up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with each other here or there,</v>

2925
01:58:11.641 --> 01:58:16.641
<v Speaker 3>but we just didn't really realize how </v>
<v Speaker 3>severe the situation was in terms of </v>

2926
01:58:16.641 --> 01:58:18.090
<v Speaker 3>just is like mental health,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2927
01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:20.700
<v Speaker 3>it's just like not a dude thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2928
01:58:20.701 --> 01:58:21.720
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how you doing?</v>

2929
01:58:21.721 --> 01:58:25.080
<v Speaker 3>And somebody isn't just like poor out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there fucking feelings were like,</v>

2930
01:58:25.110 --> 01:58:25.890
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm doing good.</v>

2931
01:58:25.891 --> 01:58:30.891
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just leave it at that and you kind </v>

2932
01:58:30.891 --> 01:58:30.891
<v Speaker 3>of move onto the next thing.</v>

2933
01:58:30.891 --> 01:58:31.050
<v Speaker 3>I have people that are in my film that </v>
<v Speaker 3>have relapsed,</v>

2934
01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:32.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>since the film.</v>

2935
01:58:32.660 --> 01:58:34.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have people that,</v>

2936
01:58:34.591 --> 01:58:35.890
<v Speaker 3>I have a guy who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2937
01:58:35.891 --> 01:58:40.891
<v Speaker 3>I had to get a release for the film,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like somehow somebody slipped up and </v>

2938
01:58:40.891 --> 01:58:42.010
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't get released for the film and I'm</v>

2939
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.450
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is like two days ago,</v>

2940
01:58:43.451 --> 01:58:46.330
<v Speaker 3>I have a guy who who relapsed and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>all fucked up.</v>

2941
01:58:46.570 --> 01:58:47.830
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to get a release of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>film.</v>

2942
01:58:47.831 --> 01:58:52.831
<v Speaker 3>We can't even get in touch with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I did send somebody to his house and </v>

2943
01:58:52.831 --> 01:58:55.840
<v Speaker 3>then we found out that he's relapsed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a mess and he needs treatment too.</v>

2944
01:58:55.841 --> 01:58:57.940
<v Speaker 3>So it's like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a dangerous,</v>

2945
01:58:57.941 --> 01:58:59.880
<v Speaker 3>powerful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

2946
01:58:59.881 --> 01:59:03.940
<v Speaker 3>and part of the whole program is helping</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people and I think it's beautiful.</v>

2947
01:59:03.941 --> 01:59:07.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like the thing now is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do I help other people,</v>

2948
01:59:07.151 --> 01:59:07.660
<v Speaker 3>how do I help?</v>

2949
01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:12.880
<v Speaker 3>The people will listen to this show and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they will hit me up on facebook and </v>

2950
01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:12.880
<v Speaker 3>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

2951
01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:13.790
<v Speaker 3>I'm an alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a drug addict,</v>

2952
01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:14.950
<v Speaker 3>drug addict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I do?</v>

2953
01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:18.190
<v Speaker 3>And the beauty is I don't have to do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>for them.</v>

2954
01:59:18.191 --> 01:59:23.191
<v Speaker 3>I can just lead them in the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>direction and help guide them to </v>

2955
01:59:23.191 --> 01:59:26.581
<v Speaker 3>treatment and be there for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that run these treatment </v>

2956
01:59:26.581 --> 01:59:26.581
<v Speaker 3>centers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscle,</v>

2957
01:59:26.581 --> 01:59:27.430
<v Speaker 3>they must feel like they're like </v>
<v Speaker 3>combating vampires or something.</v>

2958
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:30.910
<v Speaker 3>Everyone is just getting bitten and </v>
<v Speaker 3>sick.</v>

2959
01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:32.770
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>

2960
01:59:32.771 --> 01:59:35.230
<v Speaker 3>The second get sick is a good way of </v>
<v Speaker 3>putting it.</v>

2961
01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:40.260
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when somebody has something like </v>

2962
01:59:40.260 --> 01:59:42.151
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you kind of feel like they have cancer </v>

2963
01:59:42.151 --> 01:59:42.151
<v Speaker 3>or something and you don't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 3>help him.</v>

2964
01:59:42.151 --> 01:59:42.490
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people just think,</v>

2965
01:59:42.670 --> 01:59:43.480
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can help him.</v>

2966
01:59:43.481 --> 01:59:45.280
<v Speaker 3>Like hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we go like work out together,</v>

2967
01:59:45.281 --> 01:59:47.710
<v Speaker 3>if we hang out together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we go eat together,</v>

2968
01:59:47.711 --> 01:59:49.990

<v Speaker 3>his mind off it,</v>

2969
01:59:49.991 --> 01:59:53.840
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't work that way as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 3>you turn back in a way.</v>

2970
01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:55.330
<v Speaker 3>I think also vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2971
01:59:55.331 --> 01:59:56.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and looking at it people say,</v>

2972
01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:59.170
<v Speaker 3>oh it's not a news is your own fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>fault.</v>

2973
01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:01.360
<v Speaker 3>Your own personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Take all that away.</v>

2974
02:00:01.361 --> 02:00:02.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

2975
02:00:02.231 --> 02:00:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Someone's got some shit in their veins </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they need to keep pumping into their</v>

2976
02:00:05.711 --> 02:00:07.480
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like sick.</v>

2977
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:08.980
<v Speaker 3>It is sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2978
02:00:09.010 --> 02:00:11.040
<v Speaker 3>All those same people that say it's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>a sickness.</v>

2979
02:00:11.041 --> 02:00:14.350
<v Speaker 3>And I like a lot of those people will </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall into it too,</v>

2980
02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:14.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2981
02:00:14.890 --> 02:00:16.900
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that's what's fucked up about it.</v>

2982
02:00:16.901 --> 02:00:21.901
<v Speaker 3>How many people fall into it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had a lot of friends get hooked on </v>

2983
02:00:21.901 --> 02:00:21.970
<v Speaker 3>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Chris Lievens in my movie.</v>

2984
02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:22.760
<v Speaker 3>Busy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2985
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:27.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's had some issues and has had some </v>

2986
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:27.870
<v Speaker 3>issues recently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just spoke to him,</v>

2987
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:28.120
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple of days ago and he's,</v>

2988
02:00:28.180 --> 02:00:30.580
<v Speaker 3>he's on a back on the suboxone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

2989
02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.160
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2990
02:00:32.161 --> 02:00:33.580
<v Speaker 3>and it's hard to get off of that shit.</v>

2991
02:00:33.580 --> 02:00:37.630
<v Speaker 3>Like it's really hard to get off and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like suboxone is a maintenance drug</v>

2992
02:00:37.631 --> 02:00:40.630
<v Speaker 3>to keep them going back from doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do in the axes.</v>

2993
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:45.870
<v Speaker 3>But it's just something that like he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have to battle and fight </v>

2994
02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:49.950
<v Speaker 3>everyday to get off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the numbers like how many </v>

2995
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.950
<v Speaker 3>people in this country are addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain pills?</v>

2996
02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:53.210
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like two point something </v>
<v Speaker 3>million shuffled to shit.</v>

2997
02:00:53.310 --> 02:00:58.310
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well and then just how many people are </v>

2998
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.310
<v Speaker 3>just on pills period.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2999
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.380
<v Speaker 3>I know some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3000
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:59.180
<v Speaker 3>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3001
02:00:59.290 --> 02:01:00.970
<v Speaker 3>obviously some of the pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 3>drugs,</v>

3002
02:01:00.971 --> 02:01:02.560
<v Speaker 3>so the benefit one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you want a number,</v>

3003
02:01:02.730 --> 02:01:07.730
<v Speaker 3>that's a real number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want a number of million people are </v>

3004
02:01:07.730 --> 02:01:09.961
<v Speaker 3>hooked on pain pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People walking around like zombies say </v>

3005
02:01:09.961 --> 02:01:10.840
<v Speaker 3>you had an idea to help people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>

3006
02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:14.740
<v Speaker 3>I'm just freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe that's real.</v>

3007
02:01:14.741 --> 02:01:16.810
<v Speaker 3>2 million people are hooked on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

3008
02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:19.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like a national epidemic.</v>

3009
02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:24.960
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's almost one percent of the </v>

3010
02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:26.170
<v Speaker 3>population of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Last year I think 300 million people.</v>

3011
02:01:26.171 --> 02:01:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's A.</v>

3012
02:01:28.331 --> 02:01:30.560
<v Speaker 3>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>2 million fucking people.</v>

3013
02:01:30.910 --> 02:01:35.470
<v Speaker 3>Three people is one percent in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the Lazy Q,</v>

3014
02:01:35.790 --> 02:01:39.650
<v Speaker 3>One hundred and 54 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two hundred $54 million</v>

3015
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:43.320
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions were written for Vicodin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

3016
02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:46.070
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's enough to Medicaid.</v>

3017
02:01:46.071 --> 02:01:51.071
<v Speaker 2>Say that again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that number $254 million </v>

3018
02:01:51.071 --> 02:01:53.390
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions for Vicodin were written </v>
<v Speaker 2>in like last year or the year before.</v>

3019
02:01:53.630 --> 02:01:58.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's enough drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's enough painkillers to medicate </v>

3020
02:01:58.630 --> 02:02:03.131
<v Speaker 2>every male or every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every adult person in America for a </v>

3021
02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:04.610
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

3022
02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.900
<v Speaker 2>250,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$4 million.</v>

3023
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Here's another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another step.</v>

3024
02:02:08.151 --> 02:02:11.240
<v Speaker 2>Four hundred and $54 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>prescriptions were filled.</v>

3025
02:02:11.241 --> 02:02:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Is that the idea for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for painkillers?</v>

3026
02:02:13.540 --> 02:02:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that even make sense?</v>

3027
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:17.990
<v Speaker 2>That's in a whole year and a whole year </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people get several,</v>

3028
02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.320
<v Speaker 2>so they get a bit windy pills or get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of times.</v>

3029
02:02:21.321 --> 02:02:22.490
<v Speaker 2>It's like once a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3030
02:02:22.491 --> 02:02:24.740
<v Speaker 2>they a lot of times with stuff like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3031
02:02:24.741 --> 02:02:26.390
<v Speaker 2>you want to get like 10 at a time though</v>
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>

3032
02:02:26.750 --> 02:02:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's another step for you.</v>

3033
02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:30.830
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to do something about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're a congressman,</v>

3034
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:31.400
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3035
02:02:31.670 --> 02:02:32.420
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3036
02:02:32.421 --> 02:02:37.421
<v Speaker 2>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do something about this </v>

3037
02:02:37.421 --> 02:02:37.730
<v Speaker 2>epidemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's $445,000</v>

3038
02:02:38.150 --> 02:02:43.150
<v Speaker 2>sitting on your table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can either take that money from </v>

3039
02:02:43.150 --> 02:02:44.930
<v Speaker 2>lobbyists because on average that's how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much money the lobbyists will take.</v>

3040
02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:50.380
<v Speaker 2>On average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of number of </v>

3041
02:02:50.380 --> 02:02:50.900
<v Speaker 2>people in Congress and a certain amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of money that's spent.</v>

3042
02:02:50.901 --> 02:02:53.480
<v Speaker 2>So if you average it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes out to like over $400,000</v>

3043
02:02:53.481 --> 02:02:56.930
<v Speaker 2>per congressman that they use for their </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigns and everything else.</v>

3044
02:02:57.230 --> 02:03:00.020
<v Speaker 2>So you can either take that money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>

3045
02:03:00.021 --> 02:03:01.610
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's cool,</v>

3046
02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:06.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can take that money and try to </v>

3047
02:03:06.970 --> 02:03:06.970
<v Speaker 2>fight them and risk losing that money </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of your campaign.</v>

3048
02:03:06.970 --> 02:03:11.710
<v Speaker 2>So all these special interests and all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different things that people talk </v>

3049
02:03:11.710 --> 02:03:14.561
<v Speaker 2>about all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A pharmaceuticals is one of the biggest </v>

3050
02:03:14.561 --> 02:03:16.070
<v Speaker 2>ones to the one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>contributors to these campaigns.</v>

3051
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:19.220
<v Speaker 2>So people don't really have a vested </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest to stop it.</v>

3052
02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:21.710
<v Speaker 2>They have no interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

3053
02:03:21.711 --> 02:03:24.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's an any of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They weren't trying to fight it.</v>

3054
02:03:24.281 --> 02:03:25.990
<v Speaker 2>If they fought it with that little </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money,</v>

3055
02:03:25.991 --> 02:03:27.500
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't even fucking work there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3056
02:03:27.501 --> 02:03:30.320
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what amount of money would be affective?</v>

3057
02:03:30.321 --> 02:03:31.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Billions.</v>

3058
02:03:31.281 --> 02:03:34.390
<v Speaker 2>Like it's so intense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's really fucked up is this.</v>

3059
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:36.680
<v Speaker 2>This shit didn't even exist 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

3060
02:03:36.681 --> 02:03:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what's really fucked up.</v>

3061
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:42.650
<v Speaker 2>It didn't really exist 20 years ago or </v>
<v Speaker 2>how nuts is that something.</v>

3062
02:03:42.651 --> 02:03:45.510
<v Speaker 2>So we'll do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty years ago they did have quail.</v>

3063
02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the big bill cosby drugged right</v>

3064
02:03:49.320 --> 02:03:51.920
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But are they as addictive?</v>

3065
02:03:52.460 --> 02:03:55.330
<v Speaker 2>They were a completely different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From what I understand.</v>

3066
02:03:55.360 --> 02:03:58.580
<v Speaker 2>And this is just a total new level of </v>
<v Speaker 2>addictive properties,</v>

3067
02:03:58.581 --> 02:03:58.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3068
02:03:58.921 --> 02:04:00.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>

3069
02:04:00.050 --> 02:04:01.490
<v Speaker 2>if you look at um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3070
02:04:01.491 --> 02:04:05.270
<v Speaker 2>so we have drugs like morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3071
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Morphine and heroin are like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>closely related.</v>

3072
02:04:08.091 --> 02:04:09.410
<v Speaker 2>You can make one out of the other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3073
02:04:09.710 --> 02:04:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other side,</v>

3074
02:04:10.761 --> 02:04:12.470
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they now make them synthetically.</v>

3075
02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:17.920
<v Speaker 2>So this shit doesn't even require.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just chemical upon chemical upon </v>

3076
02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:20.780
<v Speaker 2>chemical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't require any sort of a base.</v>

3077
02:04:20.810 --> 02:04:23.030
<v Speaker 2>If you don't read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need opium to make it,</v>

3078
02:04:23.031 --> 02:04:26.420
<v Speaker 2>you need opium and morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't need it to make oxycotton.</v>

3079
02:04:26.510 --> 02:04:31.510
<v Speaker 2>So they figured out a way to make these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things synthetically so that they can </v>

3080
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.510
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3081
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand that well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does that work?</v>

3082
02:04:33.531 --> 02:04:38.531
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like where are they getting the raw </v>

3083
02:04:38.531 --> 02:04:38.531
<v Speaker 2>properties that would make it and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy,</v>

3084
02:04:38.531 --> 02:04:39.420
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know what the fuck they make</v>
<v Speaker 2>it from.</v>

3085
02:04:39.421 --> 02:04:42.030
<v Speaker 2>But like you can't make something out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing physically.</v>

3086
02:04:42.690 --> 02:04:44.610
<v Speaker 2>That's why I always understood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand.</v>

3087
02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Like everyone said bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan produces,</v>

3088
02:04:47.071 --> 02:04:49.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>90 whatever percent of the world's opium</v>

3089
02:04:49.531 --> 02:04:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what about pills?</v>

3090
02:04:52.490 --> 02:04:55.080
<v Speaker 2>If it's synthetic opium or synthetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

3091
02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:58.500
<v Speaker 2>what are they getting it from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan?</v>

3092
02:04:58.501 --> 02:05:03.501
<v Speaker 2>Is that they've figured out ways special</v>
<v Speaker 2>with ways to make it out of other things</v>

3093
02:05:04.201 --> 02:05:07.800
<v Speaker 2>that are like normal basis and changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>the chemical makeups of them somehow.</v>

3094
02:05:08.130 --> 02:05:10.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're stupid for this conversation.</v>

3095
02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:13.320
<v Speaker 2>So opiates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people goes,</v>

3096
02:05:13.321 --> 02:05:14.550
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's on opiates,</v>

3097
02:05:14.760 --> 02:05:16.710
<v Speaker 2>but that's not really true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless he's on morphine,</v>

3098
02:05:16.980 --> 02:05:20.930
<v Speaker 2>they're on opioids which are synthetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda like steroids,</v>

3099
02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:22.090
<v Speaker 2>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opioid.</v>

3100
02:05:22.110 --> 02:05:25.410
<v Speaker 2>See all of that boils.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hemorrhoids.</v>

3101
02:05:25.560 --> 02:05:30.560
<v Speaker 2>How strange band that we live in a world</v>
<v Speaker 2>where 200 million prescriptions for </v>

3102
02:05:30.690 --> 02:05:35.690
<v Speaker 2>super highly addictive pain pills to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribed in a year and we're supposed </v>

3103
02:05:35.941 --> 02:05:40.941
<v Speaker 2>to be like an educated country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think that like that's an epidemic for </v>

3104
02:05:40.941 --> 02:05:42.810
<v Speaker 2>prescribing to the kids and we're giving</v>
<v Speaker 2>kids,</v>

3105
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:44.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>adderall or given you the adderall,</v>

3106
02:05:44.821 --> 02:05:45.300
<v Speaker 2>Ritalin.</v>

3107
02:05:45.570 --> 02:05:46.330
<v Speaker 2>And that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3108
02:05:46.380 --> 02:05:48.990
<v Speaker 2>5 million prescriptions written for that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for kids every year,</v>

3109
02:05:48.991 --> 02:05:51.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keeps going up and up and up.</v>

3110
02:05:52.500 --> 02:05:55.410
<v Speaker 2>It seems so easy to get shit too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a mom,</v>

3111
02:05:55.760 --> 02:06:00.760
<v Speaker 2>I had to have a mom and my film and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a daughter that has adhd and so she </v>

3112
02:06:01.951 --> 02:06:06.951
<v Speaker 2>brings you to the psychiatrist or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and they prescribe her adhd </v>

3113
02:06:06.951 --> 02:06:06.951
<v Speaker 2>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3114
02:06:07.020 --> 02:06:12.020
<v Speaker 2>adderall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the mom starts taking it and then a </v>

3115
02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:13.410
<v Speaker 2>mom convinces the daughter she doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have adhd and she shouldn't take it.</v>

3116
02:06:13.650 --> 02:06:15.360
<v Speaker 2>So then the mom starts taking the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

3117
02:06:15.361 --> 02:06:20.361
<v Speaker 2>There's three other kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She took all her kids to the doctor and </v>

3118
02:06:20.361 --> 02:06:23.271
<v Speaker 2>got like four prescriptions every month </v>
<v Speaker 2>and was taken like tons of adderall.</v>

3119
02:06:23.781 --> 02:06:26.460
<v Speaker 2>She would take like 10 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet that bitch got a lot done.</v>

3120
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:27.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houses clean,</v>

3121
02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:32.760
<v Speaker 2>2010 every American adult every four </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours for one month.</v>

3122
02:06:33.700 --> 02:06:38.700
<v Speaker 2>It says every prescription painkiller </v>
<v Speaker 2>were prescribed to medicate every </v>

3123
02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:40.200
<v Speaker 2>American adults for every four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

3124
02:06:40.201 --> 02:06:41.670
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't see that line?</v>

3125
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:43.260
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you make it so I can see it?</v>

3126
02:06:46.190 --> 02:06:47.340
<v Speaker 2>Here's sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3127
02:06:47.341 --> 02:06:48.060
<v Speaker 2>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3128
02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:50.440
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the.</v>

3129
02:06:50.890 --> 02:06:52.290
<v Speaker 2>There's the text of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3130
02:06:52.291 --> 02:06:53.370
<v Speaker 2>In 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 enough,</v>

3131
02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:58.400
<v Speaker 2>prescription painkillers were prescribed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to medicate every American adult every </v>

3132
02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.250
<v Speaker 2>four hours for a month.</v>

3133
02:07:00.550 --> 02:07:03.280
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't lying Christ.</v>

3134
02:07:05.710 --> 02:07:10.710
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like three pills a day or </v>

3135
02:07:10.710 --> 02:07:10.710
<v Speaker 2>substance abusers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 2010.</v>

3136
02:07:10.710 --> 02:07:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has it gotten better or worse in five </v>

3137
02:07:15.550 --> 02:07:15.550
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3138
02:07:15.550 --> 02:07:18.831
<v Speaker 2>it either way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that numbers when I talked </v>

3139
02:07:18.831 --> 02:07:21.641
<v Speaker 2>about a purdue pharmaceuticals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>oxycontin and how that invaded America </v>

3140
02:07:21.641 --> 02:07:21.641
<v Speaker 2>and all that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

3141
02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:23.540
<v Speaker 2>If you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government,</v>

3142
02:07:23.541 --> 02:07:26.750
<v Speaker 2>at some certain point I got fed up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and I said,</v>

3143
02:07:26.751 --> 02:07:28.700
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are dying,</v>

3144
02:07:28.730 --> 02:07:33.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's cool that you guys are selling </v>

3145
02:07:33.730 --> 02:07:33.730
<v Speaker 2>all these drugs and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll take your lobby money,</v>

3146
02:07:33.730 --> 02:07:36.520
<v Speaker 2>but people are dying so you can't take </v>
<v Speaker 2>this drug.</v>

3147
02:07:36.550 --> 02:07:41.550
<v Speaker 2>You got to make a way that you can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>take it and crush it up anymore and </v>

3148
02:07:41.550 --> 02:07:43.480
<v Speaker 2>inject it or snort it or do other things</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it recreationally.</v>

3149
02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:47.290
<v Speaker 2>So now if you crush oxycotton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns into a Gel.</v>

3150
02:07:47.291 --> 02:07:49.240
<v Speaker 2>It turns into like a Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3151
02:07:49.600 --> 02:07:54.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they did was after seeing what </v>

3152
02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:58.081
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they figured out how you couldn't </v>

3153
02:07:58.081 --> 02:07:58.180
<v Speaker 2>crush it and snort it anymore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once they did that,</v>

3154
02:07:58.390 --> 02:08:00.010
<v Speaker 2>the sales dropped 80 percent.</v>

3155
02:08:02.020 --> 02:08:07.020
<v Speaker 2>So what does that tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 80 percent just shows you that </v>

3156
02:08:07.030 --> 02:08:12.030
<v Speaker 2>anything is possible with money though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How the fuck did they figure out a way </v>

3157
02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:12.030
<v Speaker 2>that if you crush it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns into a gel.</v>

3158
02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:17.160
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone talked them into doing that and </v>

3159
02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:18.520
<v Speaker 2>then they dropped 80 percent of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>profits and they stuck with it.</v>

3160
02:08:18.610 --> 02:08:21.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably fucking scramble.</v>

3161
02:08:21.601 --> 02:08:24.180
<v Speaker 2>There are studies to show that that Gel </v>
<v Speaker 2>is less effective,</v>

3162
02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:29.200
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find they find other ways to the </v>

3163
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:29.200
<v Speaker 2>pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But here's the problem.</v>

3164
02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Here's the problem with a study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3165
02:08:31.390 --> 02:08:36.390
<v Speaker 2>So everybody wants to think that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>read the studies and the studies are </v>

3166
02:08:36.390 --> 02:08:36.850
<v Speaker 2>good and the studies are valid and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3167
02:08:37.090 --> 02:08:42.090
<v Speaker 2>what happens is you need to studies that</v>
<v Speaker 2>prove that you're a pill is more </v>

3168
02:08:42.090 --> 02:08:44.440
<v Speaker 2>effective than a placebo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not effected,</v>

3169
02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.300
<v Speaker 2>not more effective than anything that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the market.</v>

3170
02:08:46.300 --> 02:08:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Just more effective than a placebo to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get your drug past.</v>

3171
02:08:49.900 --> 02:08:54.900
<v Speaker 2>So it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it costs a lot of money and a lot of </v>

3172
02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:55.570
<v Speaker 2>money through the FDA and a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>testing and all these things,</v>

3173
02:08:55.810 --> 02:08:59.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's still not very hard to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug past.</v>

3174
02:08:59.051 --> 02:09:02.770
<v Speaker 2>They just passed one called [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said [inaudible] I hydro and it's like</v>

3175
02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:08.000
<v Speaker 2>way more powerful than oxycontin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now there's another drug on the </v>

3176
02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.540
<v Speaker 2>market that's more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are these fucking monsters?</v>

3177
02:09:10.570 --> 02:09:15.570
<v Speaker 2>How do we get some of that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who are these monsters that are making </v>

3178
02:09:15.570 --> 02:09:19.201
<v Speaker 2>this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does anybody need something stronger </v>

3179
02:09:19.201 --> 02:09:20.710
<v Speaker 2>than Oxycontin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some fucking rallying cry for pain pills</v>

3180
02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:22.210
<v Speaker 2>to talk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talk about like,</v>

3181
02:09:22.220 --> 02:09:23.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana.</v>

3182
02:09:24.040 --> 02:09:26.050
<v Speaker 2>I talked to a senator about medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

3183
02:09:26.230 --> 02:09:27.790
<v Speaker 2>Medical marijuana is not killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody.</v>

3184
02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:28.660
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

3185
02:09:28.661 --> 02:09:29.650
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3186
02:09:29.890 --> 02:09:32.390
<v Speaker 2>so is that something that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3187
02:09:32.690 --> 02:09:33.460
<v Speaker 2>good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3188
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:35.620
<v Speaker 2>and we look at it and go like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3189
02:09:35.621 --> 02:09:39.040
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy what we could do with a plant</v>

3190
02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:41.680
<v Speaker 2>compared to what's happening with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3191
02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:43.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening with these pills.</v>

3192
02:09:43.930 --> 02:09:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know maybe one or two people that have</v>

3193
02:09:46.451 --> 02:09:47.520
<v Speaker 2>ruined their life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3194
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:49.780
<v Speaker 2>with pot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just because they're fucking lazy,</v>

3195
02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:52.570
<v Speaker 2>but beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the scope of that,</v>

3196
02:09:52.571 --> 02:09:54.970
<v Speaker 2>it seems to be very helpful for so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3197
02:09:55.030 --> 02:09:56.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My point of view has always been the,</v>

3198
02:09:56.890 --> 02:10:00.010
<v Speaker 2>if you pot ruins your life just because </v>
<v Speaker 2>pot got there first.</v>

3199
02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exact cheeseburgers or scratch tickets </v>

3200
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:07.441
<v Speaker 2>or the fucking job as witnesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoever gets to your commander and </v>

3201
02:10:07.441 --> 02:10:08.470
<v Speaker 2>alcohol is the fucking worst.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alcohol's the devil.</v>

3202
02:10:08.471 --> 02:10:13.471
<v Speaker 2>If you do any of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you indulge in it or you know you </v>

3203
02:10:13.471 --> 02:10:16.360
<v Speaker 2>don't have the gene for it or whatever </v>
<v Speaker 2>it is and that's not the worst.</v>

3204
02:10:16.590 --> 02:10:18.730
<v Speaker 2>You just have a drink and then you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to have a drink anymore.</v>

3205
02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had the urge to drink.</v>

3206
02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:26.040
<v Speaker 2>I like a drink every now and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've never had the urge is the same </v>

3207
02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:26.710
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I have friends who have it and I see</v>

3208
02:10:26.711 --> 02:10:26.860
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3209
02:10:26.860 --> 02:10:29.800
<v Speaker 2>It hits them and it's like a blanket </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes over their eyelids.</v>

3210
02:10:30.010 --> 02:10:32.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like they vanish so they're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>there anymore.</v>

3211
02:10:32.770 --> 02:10:37.770
<v Speaker 2>And then some new persons and those are </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that you know are going to </v>

3212
02:10:37.770 --> 02:10:37.770
<v Speaker 2>eventually have a problem if they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

3213
02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:39.140
<v Speaker 2>if they don't already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3214
02:10:39.141 --> 02:10:44.141
<v Speaker 2>I definitely have known a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>alcoholics and I know a lot of people </v>

3215
02:10:44.141 --> 02:10:48.011
<v Speaker 2>like more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than half a dozen people whose </v>

3216
02:10:48.011 --> 02:10:50.030
<v Speaker 2>lives have been wrecked by pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just usually a back injury,</v>

3217
02:10:50.130 --> 02:10:51.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something along those lines.</v>

3218
02:10:51.650 --> 02:10:53.720
<v Speaker 2>And then they take something and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>next thing you know,</v>

3219
02:10:53.721 --> 02:10:55.730
<v Speaker 2>they can't get off it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very innocent.</v>

3220
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:57.210
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a,</v>

3221
02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:01.520
<v Speaker 2>it's not something that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it turns somebody who can be a great</v>

3222
02:11:01.521 --> 02:11:04.730
<v Speaker 2>person and just somebody who lies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheats and steals.</v>

3223
02:11:04.731 --> 02:11:05.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's what's wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3224
02:11:05.781 --> 02:11:07.070
<v Speaker 2>the pills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3225
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I always just used to think like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well if I could just be on these forever</v>

3226
02:11:10.670 --> 02:11:13.430
<v Speaker 2>because I still have a lot of pain in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and my hips.</v>

3227
02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:18.430
<v Speaker 2>And like not in the hips and the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like in the lower back because of </v>

3228
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:21.790
<v Speaker 2>the hips were messed up and because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my knees are messed up and solve a lot </v>

3229
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:25.361
<v Speaker 2>of pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know that what happens with the </v>

3230
02:11:25.361 --> 02:11:26.540
<v Speaker 2>pain pills are it's diminishing returns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like after awhile I'll need,</v>

02:14:06.510 --> 02:14:07.900
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3303
02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:09.150
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a rush.</v>

3304
02:14:09.151 --> 02:14:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Limbo taken like 90 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was taking a lot.</v>

3305
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my friend,</v>

3306
02:14:13.290 --> 02:14:14.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>luther reigns,</v>

3307
02:14:14.671 --> 02:14:18.350
<v Speaker 2>he ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a massive stroke and uh,</v>

3308
02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:20.880
<v Speaker 2>now he's actually somehow.</v>

3309
02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:26.120
<v Speaker 2>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you have withdrawals from </v>

3310
02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:26.120
<v Speaker 2>painkillers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels like you're gonna die.</v>

3311
02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:27.360
<v Speaker 2>And so when he had the stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

3312
02:14:27.361 --> 02:14:32.361
<v Speaker 2>get his mother here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's not going to make it through this </v>

3313
02:14:32.361 --> 02:14:34.971
<v Speaker 2>and we can't pump them full of full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough drugs for him to get through </v>

3314
02:14:34.971 --> 02:14:35.220
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gonna.</v>

3315
02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:40.080
<v Speaker 2>He's probably not going to make it </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow miraculously the part of the,</v>

3316
02:14:40.081 --> 02:14:41.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the brain that is,</v>

3317
02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:45.390
<v Speaker 2>he is like 30 percent of his brain got </v>
<v Speaker 2>killed during the stroke.</v>

3318
02:14:45.780 --> 02:14:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Part of the brain that got killed was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the part that was responsible for </v>

3319
02:14:50.780 --> 02:14:53.880
<v Speaker 2>feeling withdrawals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somehow he fucking dodged a bullet.</v>

3320
02:14:54.420 --> 02:14:57.810
<v Speaker 2>We call him the bulletproof bad boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow he got the bullet,</v>

3321
02:14:58.260 --> 02:15:00.290
<v Speaker 2>he's alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has no more hangovers.</v>

3322
02:15:00.291 --> 02:15:05.291
<v Speaker 2>He's completely sober and he goes around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and talks to kids and churches and </v>

3323
02:15:05.291 --> 02:15:06.780
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's doing great work,</v>

3324
02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:07.100
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3325
02:15:07.180 --> 02:15:09.870
<v Speaker 2>So he lost 30 percent of his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3326
02:15:09.871 --> 02:15:12.240
<v Speaker 2>But somehow he's still a cognitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's still,</v>

3327
02:15:12.241 --> 02:15:12.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's still there.</v>

3328
02:15:13.470 --> 02:15:16.440
<v Speaker 2>He's jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's on steroids.</v>

3329
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:18.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3330
02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:22.800
<v Speaker 2>good Christ maybe might be something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3331
02:15:22.890 --> 02:15:26.130
<v Speaker 2>So he's off the pain pills on steroids </v>
<v Speaker 2>and helping our kids.</v>

3332
02:15:26.160 --> 02:15:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>

3333
02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:29.190
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kind of a world we live in.</v>

3334
02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:31.160
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day we were eating with them,</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's got this fanny pack on.</v>

3337
02:15:36.250 --> 02:15:38.880
<v Speaker 2>He's like pulling stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's trying to find his money,</v>

3338
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:39.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's fucking drooling.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's putting all these different bottles</v>

3343
02:15:48.991 --> 02:15:53.991
<v Speaker 2>of pills on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got like Viagara and a bunch of </v>

<v Speaker 2>other shit and carries the bottom with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

3345

<v Speaker 2>like a little bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a clear bag of something and he's </v>

<v Speaker 2>it looks at the clear baggies like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that was like,</v>

3352
02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:15.970
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't okay for him to put on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>table.</v>

3353
02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:19.020
<v Speaker 2>Everything else was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For some reason.</v>

3354
02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:20.400
<v Speaker 2>He like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oops.</v>

3357
02:16:25.530 --> 02:16:26.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3358
02:16:26.911 --> 02:16:31.911
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if you get like your pills mixed </v>

3359
02:16:31.911 --> 02:16:33.591

<v Speaker 2>like you're just running a ton of </v>

3360
02:16:33.591 --> 02:16:34.951
<v Speaker 2>fucking Viagra and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when maybe when he was passed out </v>

3361
02:16:35.441 --> 02:16:37.210
<v Speaker 2>in the car and maybe he was driving with</v>
<v Speaker 2>his Dick.</v>

3362
02:16:37.270 --> 02:16:38.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe just amazing bar.</v>

3363
02:16:38.850 --> 02:16:41.560
<v Speaker 2>There was no blood in his brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing because he was,</v>

3364
02:16:41.840 --> 02:16:44.140
<v Speaker 2>he was dating a porn star for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

3365
02:16:44.141 --> 02:16:46.930
<v Speaker 2>And so now he's like a born stars here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking movie.</v>

3366
02:16:46.931 --> 02:16:48.340

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3367
02:16:48.450 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bigger,</v>

3368
02:16:49.181 --> 02:16:49.710
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster.</v>

3369
02:16:49.711 --> 02:16:54.711
<v Speaker 2>You brought two porn stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two chicks making out right behind my </v>

3370
02:16:54.711 --> 02:16:57.301
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like the weirdest thing I've ever </v>

3371
02:16:57.301 --> 02:16:57.301
<v Speaker 2>seen in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a good guy.</v>

3372
02:16:57.301 --> 02:16:57.910
<v Speaker 2>He's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a lot of fun.</v>

3373
02:16:58.050 --> 02:17:02.050
<v Speaker 2>So now that he's a born again Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll be like telling me,</v>

3374
02:17:02.051 --> 02:17:03.070
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look bro,</v>

3375
02:17:03.250 --> 02:17:05.320
<v Speaker 2>now that you're sober,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you need God.</v>

3376
02:17:05.321 --> 02:17:10.321
<v Speaker 2>And He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this chick's tits that just </v>

3377
02:17:10.321 --> 02:17:10.321
<v Speaker 2>texted me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like such a contract.</v>

3378
02:17:10.321 --> 02:17:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Walking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking contradiction.</v>

3379
02:17:11.711 --> 02:17:16.711
<v Speaker 2>He's hilarious now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what if anything can be done about </v>

3380
02:17:17.261 --> 02:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>this crazy prescription drug crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems like when you,</v>

3381
02:17:20.610 --> 02:17:23.410
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were on,</v>

3382
02:17:23.411 --> 02:17:26.230
<v Speaker 2>it was the number 8 million people abuse</v>
<v Speaker 2>it every year.</v>

3383
02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:28.510
<v Speaker 2>8 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

3384
02:17:28.511 --> 02:17:31.150
<v Speaker 2>Is that like three percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>population in the country?</v>

3385
02:17:31.151 --> 02:17:33.700
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere around there was pretty big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We listen,</v>

3386
02:17:33.701 --> 02:17:35.170
<v Speaker 2>we ran a million people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3387
02:17:35.740 --> 02:17:38.230
<v Speaker 2>So nine would be three percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3388
02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:40.930
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will point seven,</v>

3389
02:17:40.931 --> 02:17:43.800
<v Speaker 2>$6 million in 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is it?</v>

3390
02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:49.010
<v Speaker 2>Lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what percentage of people are </v>

3391
02:17:49.010 --> 02:17:50.921
<v Speaker 2>adults?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It might literally be three percent of </v>

3392
02:17:50.921 --> 02:17:52.930
<v Speaker 2>the population of the whole country is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucked up on prescription pain pills.</v>

3393
02:17:52.990 --> 02:17:53.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal too.</v>

3394
02:17:53.861 --> 02:17:58.861
<v Speaker 2>Like we represent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We only represent five percent of the </v>

3395
02:17:58.861 --> 02:18:01.831
<v Speaker 2>entire world's population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We consume 75 to 85 percent of the </v>

3396
02:18:01.831 --> 02:18:06.211
<v Speaker 2>world's prescription drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of drugs because we're </v>

3397
02:18:06.211 --> 02:18:07.740
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do it big America.</v>

3398
02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:09.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to see like what,</v>

3399
02:18:09.520 --> 02:18:11.880
<v Speaker 2>what can be done about it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3400
02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:16.950
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like just ban advertising on tv for </v>

3401
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:20.701
<v Speaker 2>drugs because that just creates an </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment where people go into the </v>

3402
02:18:20.701 --> 02:18:22.060
<v Speaker 2>doctor and tell them what they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor as a fucking doctor,</v>

3403
02:18:22.090 --> 02:18:24.070
<v Speaker 2>a doctor went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you did,</v>

3404
02:18:24.130 --> 02:18:25.990
<v Speaker 2>all you did was watch a commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3405
02:18:26.290 --> 02:18:26.920
<v Speaker 2>that's advertised.</v>

3406
02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you have toenail fungus or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these stupid things.</v>

3407
02:18:30.730 --> 02:18:34.240
<v Speaker 2>So that creates a drug culture and idea </v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's a pill for everything.</v>

3408
02:18:34.530 --> 02:18:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that that idea is an idea that </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs it to go away.</v>

3409
02:18:37.990 --> 02:18:39.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>

3410
02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:42.010
<v Speaker 2>there is a pill for everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's not think that way.</v>

3411
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:43.750
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you sad?</v>

3412
02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk about me.</v>

3413
02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's one thing,</v>

3414
02:18:48.191 --> 02:18:53.191
<v Speaker 2>but I think also just like education is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important thing that we can </v>

3415
02:18:53.191 --> 02:18:54.040
<v Speaker 2>have for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's steroids,</v>

3416
02:18:54.041 --> 02:18:57.070
<v Speaker 2>whether it's prescription drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you say that you say that,</v>

3417
02:18:57.071 --> 02:18:58.510
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were educated.</v>

3418
02:18:58.600 --> 02:18:59.720
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you knew the,</v>

3419
02:18:59.790 --> 02:19:02.170
<v Speaker 2>all the pitfalls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a brother who died of it.</v>

3420
02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:07.380
<v Speaker 2>You had been hooked on it yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been doing a documentary about </v>

3421
02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:11.460
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different components of </v>

3422
02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:11.980
<v Speaker 2>addiction of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of selling these pills,</v>

3423
02:19:11.981 --> 02:19:13.930
<v Speaker 2>and yet you still got sucked into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>web.</v>

3424
02:19:14.050 --> 02:19:14.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

3425
02:19:14.921 --> 02:19:17.310
<v Speaker 2>That's how powerful it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's so crazy because you're,</v>

3426
02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:22.320
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you are about as educated about it </v>

3427
02:19:22.320 --> 02:19:22.810
<v Speaker 2>as a person can be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think now I am.</v>

3428
02:19:23.200 --> 02:19:25.000
<v Speaker 2>But back then when you were making the </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentary,</v>

3429
02:19:25.001 --> 02:19:26.540
<v Speaker 2>don't you think you are way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>educated than.</v>

3430
02:19:27.390 --> 02:19:28.250
<v Speaker 2>I was way more.</v>

3431
02:19:28.250 --> 02:19:31.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm educated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was already already susceptible to it.</v>

3432
02:19:32.090 --> 02:19:33.830
<v Speaker 3>I was already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had already been in,</v>

3433
02:19:33.890 --> 02:19:35.200
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

3434
02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:36.800
<v Speaker 3>that's a tough thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you can get,</v>

3435
02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:38.960
<v Speaker 3>get somebody before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3436
02:19:38.961 --> 02:19:42.500
<v Speaker 3>before they ever experienced it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely a warning signs.</v>

3437
02:19:42.501 --> 02:19:44.840
<v Speaker 3>Maybe before you get to that point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like reaching for a pill.</v>

3438
02:19:45.530 --> 02:19:47.080
<v Speaker 3>We mean other warning sounds like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3439
02:19:47.130 --> 02:19:52.130
<v Speaker 3>like something that happens before you </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually start to take pills or do </v>

3440
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.130
<v Speaker 3>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3441
02:19:52.130 --> 02:19:52.130
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3442
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:55.730
<v Speaker 3>was always sorta gateways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking and other things that make it.</v>

3443
02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:58.700
<v Speaker 3>Mark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it like for you to have two brothers</v>

3444
02:19:58.701 --> 02:20:02.510
<v Speaker 3>that have these polls but you don't?</v>
<v Speaker 3>My family is fucked up,</v>

3445
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:05.180
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3446
02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:07.660
<v Speaker 3>you obviously like steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I love them.</v>

3447
02:20:07.880 --> 02:20:12.880
<v Speaker 3>They're great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have like the self </v>

3448
02:20:12.880 --> 02:20:14.870
<v Speaker 3>destructive thing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you seem like a real generous guy.</v>

3449
02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:20.270
<v Speaker 3>You are a real generous guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just the fact that you have this free </v>

3450
02:20:20.270 --> 02:20:20.520
<v Speaker 3>gym and these free seminars and I saw in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3451
02:20:20.521 --> 02:20:24.470
<v Speaker 3>in the documentary that you really love </v>
<v Speaker 3>working with kids and helping them out.</v>

3452
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:26.600
<v Speaker 3>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3453
02:20:26.601 --> 02:20:29.270
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm seeing my older brother,</v>

3454
02:20:29.350 --> 02:20:30.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3455
02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:36.580
<v Speaker 3>he just like his life was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his life was really hard and he had to </v>

3456
02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:42.640
<v Speaker 3>like evade stuff and lie and like go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through all these crazy things all the </v>

3457
02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:47.201
<v Speaker 3>time because pills because of the pills </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it also put a lot of heartache </v>

3458
02:20:47.201 --> 02:20:51.910
<v Speaker 3>and stuff on a lot of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it sort of made me go the other </v>

3459
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.910
<v Speaker 3>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3460
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:55.811
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes people have a parent </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an alcoholic or apparent that </v>

3461
02:20:55.811 --> 02:20:59.660
<v Speaker 3>abuses them and it makes that person go </v>
<v Speaker 3>the complete opposite way and then other</v>

3462
02:20:59.661 --> 02:21:04.661
<v Speaker 3>times you have someone who has a parent </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an alcoholic and they end up </v>

3463
02:21:04.661 --> 02:21:04.661
<v Speaker 3>becoming the same thing.</v>

3464
02:21:04.661 --> 02:21:06.860
<v Speaker 3>I think for me it just made me steer </v>
<v Speaker 3>clear of that.</v>

3465
02:21:06.861 --> 02:21:10.250
<v Speaker 3>I just remember like seeing my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like hide alcohol,</v>

3466
02:21:10.251 --> 02:21:15.251
<v Speaker 3>like in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in bushes and shit like that from my </v>

3467
02:21:15.251 --> 02:21:17.501
<v Speaker 3>parents and lie to my parents and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>parents are are as bad as awesome a </v>

3468
02:21:17.521 --> 02:21:20.060
<v Speaker 3>parents as you can have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that was always just like,</v>

3469
02:21:20.061 --> 02:21:25.061
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like a lot of extra work </v>

3470
02:21:25.061 --> 02:21:27.191
<v Speaker 3>to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even if you told them that you were </v>

3471
02:21:27.191 --> 02:21:27.191
<v Speaker 3>having a drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably wouldn't care.</v>

3472
02:21:27.191 --> 02:21:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Not like they would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3473
02:21:27.351 --> 02:21:32.351
<v Speaker 3>go for it man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to be like your buddy </v>

3474
02:21:32.351 --> 02:21:34.331
<v Speaker 3>and have a drink with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time I don't think our </v>

3475
02:21:34.331 --> 02:21:37.181
<v Speaker 3>parents would really care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if they were like in the </v>

3476
02:21:37.181 --> 02:21:37.181
<v Speaker 3>house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd probably be like,</v>

3477
02:21:37.181 --> 02:21:41.260
<v Speaker 3>fuck it man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather have you do an it hearsay if </v>

3478
02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:41.260
<v Speaker 3>you're not.</v>

3479
02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:41.260
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not driving,</v>

3480
02:21:41.260 --> 02:21:42.170
<v Speaker 3>causing a lot of other problems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just saw like a lot of,</v>

3481
02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:46.940
<v Speaker 3>a lot of baggage that came with all that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit and you didn't see that.</v>

3482
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:49.910
<v Speaker 3>I saw it as I completely saw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

3483
02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:55.480
<v Speaker 3>getting the hip to hip replacement thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and getting hooked on pills in a way </v>

3484
02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:00.080
<v Speaker 3>that seemed to me to be a organic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3485
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:05.110
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't like uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like my brother started taking pills </v>

3486
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:05.110
<v Speaker 3>because he got hurt in wrestling and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then he.</v>

3487
02:22:05.110 --> 02:22:06.200
<v Speaker 3>But did he really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3488
02:22:06.201 --> 02:22:11.201
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if he ever got a </v>

3489
02:22:11.201 --> 02:22:12.191
<v Speaker 3>prescription for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just passed around there are </v>

3490
02:22:12.191 --> 02:22:12.890
<v Speaker 3>passed around so much and in wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was such a huge problem.</v>

3491
02:22:13.250 --> 02:22:15.230
<v Speaker 3>So for me I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I'm taking them legitimately.</v>

3492
02:22:15.231 --> 02:22:18.680
<v Speaker 3>And then it just was a snowball effect </v>
<v Speaker 3>because the doctor tells you it's okay.</v>

3493
02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:23.800
<v Speaker 3>It was a real snowball effect from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>squat when you fucked up your ankle and </v>

3494
02:22:24.171 --> 02:22:29.171
<v Speaker 3>your knee when you drop that weight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd take a little bit of stuff just </v>

3495
02:22:29.171 --> 02:22:33.531
<v Speaker 3>because it was just unreasonable not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like I just physically could not get up </v>

3496
02:22:33.531 --> 02:22:34.410
<v Speaker 3>off the couch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just in agony.</v>

3497
02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:39.440
<v Speaker 3>And then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just talked to one of my buddies at the </v>

3498
02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:39.440
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3499
02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:39.440
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a,</v>

3500
02:22:39.440 --> 02:22:41.610
<v Speaker 3>I was like a need some stuff so I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking move around.</v>

3501
02:22:41.640 --> 02:22:43.500
<v Speaker 3>So you just getting it from the gym?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna yeah,</v>

3502
02:22:43.501 --> 02:22:45.420
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where everything comes from.</v>

3503
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:50.710
<v Speaker 3>That's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys don't ever go to doctors say </v>

3504
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.710
<v Speaker 3>like when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I talk about the hip surgery,</v>

3505
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:55.671
<v Speaker 3>I mean it felt like my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my right side that they botched for two </v>

3506
02:22:55.671 --> 02:22:56.610
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like it was on fire and so,</v>

3507
02:22:56.611 --> 02:23:00.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're a buyer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to put that out.</v>

3508
02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:00.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's.</v>

3509
02:23:00.930 --> 02:23:03.090
<v Speaker 3>And then by the time you ready to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>off of it,</v>

3510
02:23:03.091 --> 02:23:06.000
<v Speaker 3>you're just so addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also told my friend though too,</v>

3511
02:23:06.001 --> 02:23:06.630
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

3512
02:23:06.631 --> 02:23:08.910
<v Speaker 3>like I'm going to come back to you for </v>
<v Speaker 3>more.</v>

3513
02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Don't get me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't fucking.</v>

3514
02:23:10.470 --> 02:23:13.530
<v Speaker 3>Don't give me any more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So give me like an amount that you think</v>

3515
02:23:13.531 --> 02:23:17.370
<v Speaker 3>is like reasonable cause my friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did you take a.</v>

3516
02:23:17.371 --> 02:23:22.371
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even remember exactly what it </v>

3517
02:23:22.371 --> 02:23:22.371
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it was.</v>

3518
02:23:22.371 --> 02:23:23.600
<v Speaker 3>It worked pretty good though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just don't know.</v>

3519
02:23:24.080 --> 02:23:26.250
<v Speaker 3>Take two or how much you tell a </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

3520
02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:26.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3521
02:23:26.701 --> 02:23:28.770
<v Speaker 3>This takes some for a few.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3522
02:23:28.800 --> 02:23:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also,</v>

3523
02:23:29.611 --> 02:23:34.611
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would also steered me clear of a lot of </v>

3524
02:23:34.611 --> 02:23:36.831
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least as I got in a little bit older </v>

3525
02:23:36.831 --> 02:23:36.831
<v Speaker 3>is I met my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3526
02:23:36.831 --> 02:23:40.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been married for almost 15 years </v>

3527
02:23:40.780 --> 02:23:41.610
<v Speaker 3>now and been together for about 17 years</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I have children.</v>

3528
02:23:41.610 --> 02:23:45.120
<v Speaker 3>I got a lot of responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like even if I want to get fucked up,</v>

3529
02:23:45.121 --> 02:23:47.340
<v Speaker 3>like I don't have time to like go do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>really.</v>

3530
02:23:47.490 --> 02:23:49.170
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you've got a lot of obligations.</v>

3531
02:23:49.200 --> 02:23:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Your brother didn't have any kids now </v>
<v Speaker 3>married.</v>

3532
02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:54.330
<v Speaker 3>He didn't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have any kids?</v>

3533
02:23:54.331 --> 02:23:59.331
<v Speaker 3>Not all kids wonder if that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever it's the responsibility of the </v>

3534
02:23:59.331 --> 02:24:00.390
<v Speaker 3>children just keeps you just having </v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody,</v>

3535
02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:03.240
<v Speaker 3>somebody else in my life that cares </v>
<v Speaker 3>about me,</v>

3536
02:24:03.241 --> 02:24:05.580
<v Speaker 3>somebody else sets a supportive and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

3537
02:24:05.581 --> 02:24:08.340
<v Speaker 3>she's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as part of the company's success</v>

3538
02:24:08.341 --> 02:24:11.340
<v Speaker 3>as I am.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So all that definitely plays into it.</v>

3539
02:24:11.730 --> 02:24:16.730
<v Speaker 3>That's such a scary number of the eight </v>
<v Speaker 3>point 7 million people that are abusing </v>

3540
02:24:16.831 --> 02:24:20.340
<v Speaker 3>it and that been 2010 and not knowing </v>
<v Speaker 3>what it is in 2015.</v>

3541
02:24:20.730 --> 02:24:23.940
<v Speaker 3>That's terrifying to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the idea that we could be in that</v>

3542
02:24:23.941 --> 02:24:28.941
<v Speaker 3>state and it's sort of like something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that flies under the radar for the most </v>

3543
02:24:28.941 --> 02:24:32.121
<v Speaker 3>part unless you know somebody and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think of that person is an isolated </v>

3544
02:24:32.121 --> 02:24:33.780
<v Speaker 3>incident here you think of that person's</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy or that person's doing it.</v>

3545
02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Then like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing it to themselves and you know,</v>

3546
02:24:36.530 --> 02:24:40.170
<v Speaker 3>like there is definitely personal </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility in all of this.</v>

3547
02:24:40.171 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Whether whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

3548
02:24:42.810 --> 02:24:47.810
<v Speaker 3>but at a certain point when things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>so addictive that people don't really </v>

3549
02:24:47.810 --> 02:24:51.800
<v Speaker 3>know about it or the doctors are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>handing them out like crazy for a while.</v>

3550
02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:54.000
<v Speaker 3>A couple years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they shut these all down.</v>

3551
02:24:54.001 --> 02:24:55.520
<v Speaker 3>There were pill mills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you just,</v>

3552
02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.680
<v Speaker 3>they call them pill mills and people </v>
<v Speaker 3>would come from West Virginia drive all </v>

3553
02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:01.410
<v Speaker 3>the way down to Florida just to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>pills,</v>

3554
02:25:01.411 --> 02:25:02.840
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So am I,</v>

3555
02:25:02.910 --> 02:25:04.800
<v Speaker 3>my friend that we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>before luther,</v>

3556
02:25:04.801 --> 02:25:09.801
<v Speaker 3>he just said he would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he'd have seven prescriptions and he's </v>

3557
02:25:09.801 --> 02:25:12.711
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my whole day would be driving around to </v>

3558
02:25:12.711 --> 02:25:14.341
<v Speaker 3>different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>different pharmacies picking up </v>

3559
02:25:14.341 --> 02:25:15.600
<v Speaker 3>different prescriptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now they have this drug database that if</v>

3560
02:25:15.601 --> 02:25:20.601
<v Speaker 3>you get a prescription from walgreens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't go to costco and get that </v>

3561
02:25:20.601 --> 02:25:21.810
<v Speaker 3>prescription however nobody really uses </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3562
02:25:21.930 --> 02:25:24.070
<v Speaker 3>So we have to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another way to get.</v>

3563
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Nobody uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3564
02:25:25.271 --> 02:25:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have a plus,</v>

3565
02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:31.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dea regulates how many of these </v>

3566
02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:32.500
<v Speaker 2>drugs are made and there's way more </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs made than are actually needed.</v>

3567
02:25:32.501 --> 02:25:34.720
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of those fall off the truck and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3568
02:25:34.721 --> 02:25:37.520
<v Speaker 2>different things happen where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>retained.</v>

3569
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:38.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3570
02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:42.460

3571
02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:47.520
<v Speaker 2>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive money making system and </v>

3572
02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:50.080
<v Speaker 2>everybody's on the take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck.</v>

3573
02:25:50.530 --> 02:25:53.770
<v Speaker 2>A lot of money be made and it's killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people like vampires.</v>

3574
02:25:53.830 --> 02:25:55.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we have a war on drugs.</v>

3575
02:25:55.420 --> 02:25:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Are there really vampires vampire to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say in the book and the film.</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's what there's always been,</v>

3578
02:26:05.090 --> 02:26:05.890
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3579
02:26:05.930 --> 02:26:08.110
<v Speaker 2>While,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while we had a Nancy Reagan,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>up there saying just say no.</v>

<v Speaker 2>business that allowed the pharmaceutical</v>

3582
02:26:15.131 --> 02:26:16.300
<v Speaker 2>companies that grow so big.</v>

3583
02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:20.680
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this documentary then,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the newest one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what takes place in it that you found </v>

3585
02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:26.830
<v Speaker 2>was shocking?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>

3586
02:26:26.900 --> 02:26:30.520
<v Speaker 2>What was going through this journey of </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting together this documentary?</v>

3587
02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Was there anything that shocked you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3588
02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:34.900
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>

3589
02:26:34.901 --> 02:26:36.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I interviewed this woman,</v>

3590
02:26:36.311 --> 02:26:41.170
<v Speaker 2>Gwen Olson went Olsen used to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical sales rep that uh,</v>

3591
02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:45.830
<v Speaker 2>quit when her daughter killed herself on</v>
<v Speaker 2>psych meds and um,</v>

3592
02:26:46.210 --> 02:26:51.210
<v Speaker 2>it's her stories just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just meeting somebody who actually </v>

3593
02:26:51.210 --> 02:26:55.890
<v Speaker 2>worked through the system to to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the people in the pharmaceutical </v>

3594
02:26:56.261 --> 02:27:01.261
<v Speaker 2>companies get pumped up when they have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>new drug coming out that can actually </v>

3595
02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:04.660
<v Speaker 2>fix the side effects of another drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>they already have on the market.</v>

3596
02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:07.450
<v Speaker 2>And they're so excited because I know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how much money they're gonna make off of</v>

3597
02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:09.040
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like sickening.</v>

3598
02:27:09.041 --> 02:27:12.730
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is disgusting and sickening and it's not</v>

3599
02:27:12.731 --> 02:27:13.390
<v Speaker 2>about health.</v>

3600
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:15.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I really learned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Worry is terrifying.</v>

3601
02:27:16.210 --> 02:27:20.950
<v Speaker 2>It was stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Has it's such a machine that's making so</v>

3602
02:27:20.951 --> 02:27:25.951
<v Speaker 2>many billions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you stop it and how do you level </v>

3603
02:27:25.951 --> 02:27:25.951
<v Speaker 2>it out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3604
02:27:25.951 --> 02:27:28.210
<v Speaker 2>I think people that stopped taking money</v>
<v Speaker 2>from pharmaceutical companies,</v>

3605
02:27:28.211 --> 02:27:29.590
<v Speaker 2>that's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3606
02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:31.900
<v Speaker 2>they have Donald Trump running and half </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people are like,</v>

3607
02:27:31.901 --> 02:27:33.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

3608
02:27:33.011 --> 02:27:38.011
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that's not going to </v>

3609
02:27:38.011 --> 02:27:38.011
<v Speaker 2>play into his decision making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3610
02:27:38.011 --> 02:27:40.510
<v Speaker 2>So if people like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying him specifically,</v>

3611
02:27:40.511 --> 02:27:42.250
<v Speaker 2>but people like that to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

3612
02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:44.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to take their money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what they say.</v>

3613
02:27:44.621 --> 02:27:45.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3614
02:27:45.671 --> 02:27:48.530
<v Speaker 2>it's the same thing with oil or any of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these other problems like we,</v>

3615
02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:52.090
<v Speaker 2>the way we fix problems is not to bribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressmen,</v>

3616
02:27:52.480 --> 02:27:57.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that's a huge thing and a </v>

3617
02:27:57.480 --> 02:27:59.510
<v Speaker 2>huge thing is for regular average </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday citizens to say no to a,</v>

3618
02:27:59.530 --> 02:28:01.630
<v Speaker 2>to what's going on and stop and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3619
02:28:01.631 --> 02:28:06.631
<v Speaker 2>write to their congressman and make us </v>
<v Speaker 2>think if all this stuff like people </v>

3620
02:28:06.631 --> 02:28:07.670
<v Speaker 2>wanted medical marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical marijuana,</v>

3621
02:28:07.671 --> 02:28:11.710
<v Speaker 2>it didn't come about because some </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressmen said,</v>

3622
02:28:11.711 --> 02:28:12.490
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make.</v>

3623
02:28:12.490 --> 02:28:14.770
<v Speaker 2>This took a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took a long time.</v>

3624
02:28:14.771 --> 02:28:19.300
<v Speaker 2>It took a massive movement of a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of people to say we want this.</v>

3625
02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:20.810
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3626
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:22.550
<v Speaker 2>if you at a food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

3627
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:24.770
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's sort of going organic,</v>

3628
02:28:24.771 --> 02:28:29.771
<v Speaker 2>it's easier to find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As hard as it is sometimes to find good </v>

3629
02:28:29.771 --> 02:28:32.891
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a lot easier than it used to </v>

3630
02:28:32.891 --> 02:28:32.891
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like Costco.</v>

3631
02:28:32.891 --> 02:28:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Costco is like all going organic now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people want it.</v>

3632
02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:37.200
<v Speaker 2>So if people want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3633
02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:42.250
<v Speaker 2>a drug free society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a society where their kids aren't dying </v>

3634
02:28:42.250 --> 02:28:44.300
<v Speaker 2>and killing each other over drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a society where people can live in peace</v>

3635
02:28:44.301 --> 02:28:47.540
<v Speaker 2>and harmony and not have their families </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruined by these problems,</v>

3636
02:28:47.541 --> 02:28:49.970
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can basically start that front,</v>

3637
02:28:50.030 --> 02:28:55.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like they did with all these other </v>

3638
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.030
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a groundswell,</v>

3639
02:28:55.030 --> 02:28:55.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like something that has to start.</v>

3640
02:28:56.390 --> 02:29:01.390
<v Speaker 2>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't know how you would ever </v>

3641
02:29:01.390 --> 02:29:03.311
<v Speaker 2>stopped that amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems like the amount of money is so </v>

3642
02:29:03.311 --> 02:29:05.750
<v Speaker 2>fucking terrifying and that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies can just live with themselves.</v>

3643
02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:07.390
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so bizarre.</v>

3644
02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:12.440
<v Speaker 2>They can justify the production of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking pills when they know that 9 </v>

3645
02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:16.490
<v Speaker 2>million people or whatever the number is</v>
<v Speaker 2>or abusing them just in this country </v>

3646
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:18.950
<v Speaker 2>with a massive amount of the drugs on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the market and pharmaceuticals,</v>

3647
02:29:18.951 --> 02:29:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't even work know they,</v>

3648
02:29:21.070 --> 02:29:22.150
<v Speaker 2>they had been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3649
02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:24.620
<v Speaker 2>they're not proven effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The psych meds that we put,</v>

3650
02:29:24.621 --> 02:29:26.780
<v Speaker 2>we put our kids on were never tested on </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

3651
02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:30.470
<v Speaker 2>So if it's not tested on a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't give it to my kid.</v>

3652
02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:32.990
<v Speaker 2>That's what people need to start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people say,</v>

3653
02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:34.970
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easier for.</v>

3654
02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I put my kid on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to make the exception.</v>

3655
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Every parent I talk to says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3656
02:29:39.321 --> 02:29:44.321
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my kids different [inaudible] I put </v>

3657
02:29:44.321 --> 02:29:44.930
<v Speaker 2>them on adderall and now he's fine </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather than to search out all the other,</v>

3658
02:29:44.950 --> 02:29:45.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the other options.</v>

3659
02:29:45.981 --> 02:29:50.981
<v Speaker 2>So then people want to try to solve </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff with money or with or with a pill </v>

3660
02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:51.920
<v Speaker 2>rather than with their time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3661
02:29:51.930 --> 02:29:52.910
<v Speaker 2>that's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big issue.</v>

3662
02:29:52.911 --> 02:29:57.911
<v Speaker 2>If your child has trouble in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe your kid just has trouble in</v>

3663
02:29:57.981 --> 02:29:59.600
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking sucked in school.</v>

3664
02:30:00.300 --> 02:30:01.790
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really.</v>

3665
02:30:02.060 --> 02:30:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Each person is going to have their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>different thing.</v>

3666
02:30:04.251 --> 02:30:07.400
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be good and bad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't necessarily need a pill to try</v>

3667
02:30:07.401 --> 02:30:08.900
<v Speaker 2>to solve that problem all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3668
02:30:08.980 --> 02:30:12.770
<v Speaker 2>and school is fucking gross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of sitting in a classroom,</v>

3669
02:30:12.771 --> 02:30:15.470
<v Speaker 2>especially with some fucking teacher </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's unmotivated,</v>

3670
02:30:15.730 --> 02:30:19.460
<v Speaker 2>sit there and you're just supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorb this fucking hours on end.</v>

3671
02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:22.760
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of data that's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not designed for that yet.</v>

3672
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:25.790
<v Speaker 2>They would thrive doing something in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

3673
02:30:26.050 --> 02:30:28.160
<v Speaker 2>You just have to figure out what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>something is.</v>

3674
02:30:28.630 --> 02:30:33.630
<v Speaker 2>They can absolutely contributed to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>not care about geometry or not care </v>

3675
02:30:33.630 --> 02:30:35.480
<v Speaker 2>about history or not care about whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is that's uninspired.</v>

3676
02:30:35.481 --> 02:30:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it's the the teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some teachers get excited about anything</v>

3677
02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:45.280
<v Speaker 2>fun to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Creativity is more important than </v>

3678
02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:45.310
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like Albert Einstein,</v>

3679
02:30:45.330 --> 02:30:47.330
<v Speaker 2>right with him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3680
02:30:47.420 --> 02:30:49.970
<v Speaker 2>he was always a had trouble in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning,</v>

3681
02:30:49.971 --> 02:30:54.971
<v Speaker 2>disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed with all these learning </v>

3682
02:30:54.971 --> 02:30:56.921
<v Speaker 2>disabled,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put in a class with the kid that the </v>

3683
02:30:56.921 --> 02:30:57.440
<v Speaker 2>kids that eat glue and all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the typical case of that,</v>

3684
02:30:57.500 --> 02:31:01.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's become very successful off of a</v>

3685
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:02.240
<v Speaker 2>passion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3686
02:31:02.320 --> 02:31:04.580
<v Speaker 2>If you just find what it is you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really good at.</v>

3687
02:31:04.640 --> 02:31:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have different personalities and </v>

3688
02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:09.640
<v Speaker 2>there's different occupations.</v>

3689
02:31:09.640 --> 02:31:10.640
<v Speaker 2>You just got to figure out what works </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you,</v>

3690
02:31:11.090 --> 02:31:13.430
<v Speaker 2>but all that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just.</v>

3691
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:18.590
<v Speaker 2>The sheer numbers of the drugs is what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaking me out in this conversation.</v>

3692
02:31:18.930 --> 02:31:23.930
<v Speaker 2>This almost seems like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some crazy plague that no one's </v>

3693
02:31:23.930 --> 02:31:26.720
<v Speaker 2>talking about disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a disease,</v>

3694
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:31.750
<v Speaker 2>a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just spreading across the country </v>

3695
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:34.580
<v Speaker 2>and that we're all kind of silent about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it until it's too late and there's no </v>

3696
02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:34.580
<v Speaker 2>vaccine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just nothing.</v>

3697
02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:37.080
<v Speaker 2>That's why he was so excited to come on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>

3698
02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:38.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be able to talk about it and get,</v>

3699
02:31:38.760 --> 02:31:43.760
<v Speaker 2>get more information out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when does your film come out </v>

3700
02:31:43.760 --> 02:31:44.760
<v Speaker 2>to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My film will come out in the fall.</v>

3701
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:49.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't announced the release date </v>

3702
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:51.591
<v Speaker 2>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Samuel Goldwyn is the one that's </v>

3703
02:31:51.591 --> 02:31:51.591
<v Speaker 2>putting it out on Samuel Goldwyn </v>
<v Speaker 2>company,</v>

3704
02:31:51.591 --> 02:31:52.370
<v Speaker 2>so they'll get a theatrical release and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll get it,</v>

3705
02:31:52.371 --> 02:31:53.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big digital release.</v>

3706
02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:58.550
<v Speaker 2>So we're excited about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will let me know when that happens and </v>

3707
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:59.700
<v Speaker 2>I'd be happy to tweet about it and let </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody know about it and put it up on</v>

3708
02:31:59.701 --> 02:32:03.510
<v Speaker 2>facebook and one God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>

3709
02:32:03.540 --> 02:32:06.850
<v Speaker 2>So do you do these yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this your own project?</v>

3710
02:32:06.851 --> 02:32:10.080
<v Speaker 2>Do you storyboard amount you like you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a little crazy.</v>

3711
02:32:10.081 --> 02:32:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I did bigger,</v>

3712
02:32:11.701 --> 02:32:12.520
<v Speaker 2>stronger fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3713
02:32:12.540 --> 02:32:17.540
<v Speaker 2>I went to USC film school when I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to make films for years and we </v>

3714
02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:19.350
<v Speaker 2>all struggled trying to like make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3715
02:32:19.351 --> 02:32:20.820
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in these different endeavors,</v>

3716
02:32:20.880 --> 02:32:23.070
<v Speaker 2>whether it be acting or filmmaking or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

3717
02:32:23.071 --> 02:32:24.160
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3718
02:32:24.190 --> 02:32:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I was struggling for years writing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of scripts,</v>

3719
02:32:26.461 --> 02:32:27.720
<v Speaker 2>getting really close,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3720
02:32:27.721 --> 02:32:30.030
<v Speaker 2>how it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really close to getting something</v>

3721
02:32:30.031 --> 02:32:31.030
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

3722
02:32:31.110 --> 02:32:31.930
<v Speaker 2>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after awhile,</v>

3723
02:32:32.100 --> 02:32:37.100
<v Speaker 2>like nothing was happening and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if anything in life is going to happen </v>

3724
02:32:37.100 --> 02:32:37.350
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need to make it happen.</v>

3725
02:32:37.350 --> 02:32:40.050
<v Speaker 2>I can't be sitting here waiting for </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody to go,</v>

3726
02:32:40.051 --> 02:32:40.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

3727
02:32:40.351 --> 02:32:42.220
<v Speaker 2>I really liked your script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make it or blah,</v>

3728
02:32:42.221 --> 02:32:42.720
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blah blah.</v>

3729
02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:45.480
<v Speaker 2>So long story short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bigger,</v>

3730
02:32:45.481 --> 02:32:49.130
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster was the brain child of,</v>

3731
02:32:49.131 --> 02:32:52.140
<v Speaker 2>of me and my partner is Alex Bono and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tamsin Bono.</v>

3732
02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:54.450
<v Speaker 2>They were um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple that,</v>

3733
02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:55.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3734
02:32:55.350 --> 02:32:57.540
<v Speaker 2>had experienced with documentaries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

3735
02:32:57.541 --> 02:33:00.120
<v Speaker 2>And just through conversations with them</v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

3736
02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:01.770
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go make this on our own.</v>

3737
02:33:01.980 --> 02:33:04.740
<v Speaker 2>So we raised all the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went out and we made it on her own.</v>

3738
02:33:04.990 --> 02:33:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second film I did was called trophy </v>

3739
02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:12.321
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that with Peter Berg was the </v>

3740
02:33:12.321 --> 02:33:12.870
<v Speaker 2>executive producer of that and that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a film that because a bigger,</v>

3741
02:33:12.871 --> 02:33:14.010
<v Speaker 2>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster pizza,</v>

3742
02:33:14.011 --> 02:33:14.400
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

3743
02:33:14.430 --> 02:33:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I want to work with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we did a movie about crazy sports </v>

3744
02:33:19.430 --> 02:33:19.430
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

3745
02:33:19.430 --> 02:33:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I ended up on a hbo and that'll be </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually be available on demand on </v>

3746
02:33:22.340 --> 02:33:26.330

<v Speaker 2>That'll be coming out on demand </v>

3747

<v Speaker 2>version is one.</v>

3750
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:34.500

<v Speaker 2>part of his show called state of play.</v>

3751
02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:38.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that ended up serving two purposes.</v>

3752
02:33:38.071 --> 02:33:41.220
<v Speaker 2>We got distribution for a movie we </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought was really cool and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Trophy kids is basically,</v>

3755
02:33:47.281 --> 02:33:47.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

3756
02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:52.580
<v Speaker 2>it's so fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just came here and we have this </v>

3757
02:33:52.580 --> 02:33:55.020
<v Speaker 2>tennis mom that's in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in trophy kids and she's like,</v>

3758
02:33:55.021 --> 02:33:59.100
<v Speaker 2>this really like a godly Jesus Freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3759
02:33:59.370 --> 02:34:04.370
<v Speaker 2>and we just saw her at the restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just say that before when we came </v>

3760
02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:07.401
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen her in like two years </v>

3761
02:34:07.401 --> 02:34:07.401
<v Speaker 2>since we did the movie.</v>

3762
02:34:07.401 --> 02:34:10.190
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though that film's really interesting </v>

3763
02:34:10.190 --> 02:34:11.991
<v Speaker 2>because parents nowadays are really </v>
<v Speaker 2>putting the pressure on their kids to </v>

3764
02:34:11.991 --> 02:34:11.991
<v Speaker 2>succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3765
02:34:11.991 --> 02:34:16.401
<v Speaker 2>I think they always have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now there's so much money involved </v>

3766
02:34:16.401 --> 02:34:17.620
<v Speaker 2>in sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting scarier investments.</v>

3767
02:34:17.680 --> 02:34:18.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the kids,</v>

3768
02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:19.700
<v Speaker 2>the kids aren't any good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3769
02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:21.790
<v Speaker 2>bottom line is like if a kid's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to make it,</v>

3770
02:34:21.850 --> 02:34:26.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no amount of investing in their </v>

3771
02:34:26.850 --> 02:34:27.250
<v Speaker 2>quarterback skills is gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3772
02:34:27.251 --> 02:34:29.830
<v Speaker 2>it'll help some kids get maybe over that</v>
<v Speaker 2>hump.</v>

3773
02:34:29.831 --> 02:34:31.900
<v Speaker 2>But then are you going to beat John </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones?</v>

3774
02:34:32.270 --> 02:34:37.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Reality John Jones is going to be </v>

3775
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.270
<v Speaker 2>John John's coming out of the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3776
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.270
<v Speaker 2>killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3777
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:38.320
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3778
02:34:38.370 --> 02:34:43.370
<v Speaker 2>that's the thing about the trophy kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the thing about parents that are </v>

3779
02:34:43.370 --> 02:34:46.951
<v Speaker 2>really into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always disturbing is it seems </v>

3780
02:34:46.951 --> 02:34:47.710
<v Speaker 2>like they're trying to live their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their failures through the kid,</v>

3781
02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:53.080
<v Speaker 2>like they want to sort of reimagine </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own life and have some success </v>

3782
02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:53.950
<v Speaker 2>through,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the kids' work.</v>

3783
02:34:54.040 --> 02:34:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I have a basketball dad who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3784
02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:57.520
<v Speaker 2>he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

3785
02:34:57.521 --> 02:34:59.710
<v Speaker 2>do you think you're living vicariously </v>
<v Speaker 2>through your son?</v>

3786
02:34:59.980 --> 02:35:02.320
<v Speaker 2>Because like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not vicariously man directly.</v>

3787
02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:05.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean every shot in each move in each </v>
<v Speaker 2>go.</v>

3788
02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:10.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the referees make me want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pull my hair out or my case make me </v>

3789
02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:14.161
<v Speaker 2>pulled their hair out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're listening to this </v>

3790
02:35:14.161 --> 02:35:14.161
<v Speaker 2>going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking crazy.</v>

3791
02:35:14.450 --> 02:35:15.220
<v Speaker 2>Your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3792
02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:20.360
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's just normal behavior to these </v>

3793
02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:20.360
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this everyday behavior.</v>

3794
02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much did you spend on your son,</v>

3795
02:35:21.910 --> 02:35:23.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on your son's basketball career?</v>

3796
02:35:24.260 --> 02:35:25.560
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

3797
02:35:25.561 --> 02:35:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say two lamborghinis easy.</v>

3798
02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:33.180
<v Speaker 2>And who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who measures their wealth and </v>

3799
02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:33.180
<v Speaker 2>lamborghinis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

3800
02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:34.050
<v Speaker 2>that's weird with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3801
02:35:34.090 --> 02:35:36.490
<v Speaker 2>did you see this story on a Todd </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marinovich?</v>

3802
02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Timer intervention,</v>

3803
02:35:38.110 --> 02:35:41.830
<v Speaker 2>which is another similar story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to the extreme is a great movie that</v>

3804
02:35:41.831 --> 02:35:44.410
<v Speaker 2>a espn did as part as part of the 30 for</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

3805
02:35:44.411 --> 02:35:48.030
<v Speaker 2>which I actually pitched them that be </v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

3806
02:35:48.040 --> 02:35:51.130
<v Speaker 2>pitched them that before they did it so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that somebody else had pitched it like I</v>

3807
02:35:51.131 --> 02:35:52.330
<v Speaker 2>guess right around the same time.</v>

3808
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:54.480
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they did a great job with.</v>

3809
02:35:54.490 --> 02:35:55.810
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3810
02:35:55.811 --> 02:35:59.100
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very disturbing story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also an,</v>

3811
02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:04.660
<v Speaker 2>it really highlights the problem because</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you've got a guy who's like an all </v>

3812
02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:08.641
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great nfl strength and conditioning </v>

3813
02:36:08.641 --> 02:36:10.960
<v Speaker 2>coach understands the science of </v>
<v Speaker 2>strength and conditioning and,</v>

3814
02:36:10.961 --> 02:36:13.990
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and preparing someone for a sport almost</v>

3815
02:36:13.991 --> 02:36:16.390
<v Speaker 2>better than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he has a kid and he says,</v>

3816
02:36:16.391 --> 02:36:17.470
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

3817
02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:19.680
<v Speaker 2>I got fucking project now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turn this kid into.</v>

3818
02:36:19.681 --> 02:36:24.681
<v Speaker 2>And it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But meanwhile the kid didn't want to do </v>

3819
02:36:24.681 --> 02:36:24.681
<v Speaker 2>it and it became a heroin addict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became an artist.</v>

3820
02:36:24.681 --> 02:36:25.960
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to do it.</v>

3821
02:36:26.370 --> 02:36:28.720
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's what happens when he </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushed kids too much.</v>

3822
02:36:28.721 --> 02:36:31.390
<v Speaker 2>Like a kid kinda has to find out how </v>
<v Speaker 2>talented thing.</v>

3823
02:36:31.420 --> 02:36:34.960
<v Speaker 2>How talented Todd Marinovich is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spoken with them several times.</v>

3824
02:36:34.961 --> 02:36:36.240
<v Speaker 2>He's actually cool.</v>

3825
02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:41.280
<v Speaker 2>Really super cool guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He told me he went and played in arena </v>

3826
02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:44.581
<v Speaker 2>football league game and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>withdrawing from heroin so bad that he </v>

3827
02:36:44.581 --> 02:36:48.580
<v Speaker 2>had shit his pants and he had thrown 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>touchdown passes with shit in his pants.</v>

3828
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:50.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just like,</v>

3829
02:36:51.080 --> 02:36:52.420
<v Speaker 2>it was so easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

3830
02:36:52.421 --> 02:36:53.820
<v Speaker 2>footballs easy man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

3831
02:36:54.100 --> 02:36:55.870
<v Speaker 2>it's just like numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't leave them.</v>

3832
02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:57.780
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Won a heisman trophy.</v>

3833
02:36:57.790 --> 02:37:02.790
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know he was close up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think his dad is a fucking freak man.</v>

3834
02:37:03.011 --> 02:37:05.190
<v Speaker 2>His Dad did an amazing job with Bj Penn </v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

3835
02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:07.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's his dad's a freak man.</v>

3836
02:37:07.021 --> 02:37:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Is that they think they've made amends </v>
<v Speaker 2>with all that stuff.</v>

3837
02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:11.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just hard to do it to your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>kids.</v>

3838
02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:14.530
<v Speaker 2>You can do it to somebody else's kid and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make them a fucking machine,</v>

3839
02:37:14.990 --> 02:37:16.220
<v Speaker 2>but you're not the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also</v>

3840
02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:19.520
<v Speaker 1>don't want know what your kid wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think like at a young age,</v>

3841
02:37:19.521 --> 02:37:21.440
<v Speaker 1>I think todd Marinovich said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to be in the nfl,</v>

3842
02:37:21.441 --> 02:37:23.090
<v Speaker 1>but what kid doesn't say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3843
02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

3844
02:37:24.171 --> 02:37:26.930
<v Speaker 1>what kid doesn't change his mind when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes 16 or 18,</v>

3845
02:37:26.931 --> 02:37:28.910
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain side of it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll look at the dad.</v>

3846
02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:34.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was influenced heavily by my older </v>

3847
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.030
<v Speaker 1>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be,</v>

3848
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3849
02:37:34.030 --> 02:37:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be like theater and drama.</v>

3850
02:37:36.350 --> 02:37:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do these other things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are considered like,</v>

3851
02:37:38.930 --> 02:37:39.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Pansy,</v>

3852
02:37:39.770 --> 02:37:40.510
<v Speaker 1>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

3853
02:37:40.930 --> 02:37:45.930
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so those things through the culture </v>

3854
02:37:45.930 --> 02:37:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not tough if you do those things.</v>

3855
02:37:46.071 --> 02:37:48.050
<v Speaker 1>We did when we were kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was gay,</v>

3856
02:37:48.510 --> 02:37:51.410
<v Speaker 1>it was considered soccer's gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's gay.</v>

3857
02:37:51.411 --> 02:37:53.150
<v Speaker 1>So what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I wanted to like,</v>

3858
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:58.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I had like a passion to make films </v>

3859
02:37:58.990 --> 02:37:58.990
<v Speaker 1>and do that stuff.</v>

3860
02:37:58.990 --> 02:37:58.990
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of hard to tell everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3861
02:37:58.990 --> 02:38:00.020
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really,</v>

3862
02:38:00.110 --> 02:38:01.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't really care that much about </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifting anymore.</v>

3863
02:38:01.971 --> 02:38:02.920
<v Speaker 1>I want to go this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3864
02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:04.410
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that,</v>

3865
02:38:04.411 --> 02:38:05.580
<v Speaker 1>that stuff's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3866
02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger,</v>

3867
02:38:06.951 --> 02:38:08.540
<v Speaker 1>stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster is available.</v>
