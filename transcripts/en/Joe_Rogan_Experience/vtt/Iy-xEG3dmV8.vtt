1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.740
<v Speaker 1>The general experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson was not an ecstatic</v>

2
00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.140
<v Speaker 1>onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson wasn't incredible,</v>

3
00:00:07.141 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>astonishing performer who had studied</v>
<v Speaker 1>his craft from the age of nine,</v>

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>and so he worked out every single move</v>
<v Speaker 1>and advance John,</v>

5
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you never knew from one night to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next what prince or John Mellencamp</v>

6
00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do in performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't know how well did you know</v>

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Michael Jackson?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought very,</v>

8
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>very well and he was the most remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>person I've ever met in my life.</v>

9
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:31.200
<v Speaker 1>And when I tell people how remarkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't believe me,</v>

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.210
<v Speaker 1>and I and Jamie are on a certain level</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know.</v>

12
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>We're on a certain level because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured these are the range.</v>

13
00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>This is the range of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we go out and meet anybody on the</v>

14
00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>street or even anybody famous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with Buzz Aldrin these days.</v>

15
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>What we're gonna encounter is another</v>
<v Speaker 1>person pretty much like costs.</v>

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Michael Jackson's case,</v>

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.830
<v Speaker 1>he did not fit on this normal plain at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>He was on a plane somewhere where you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen a human being before.</v>

19
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So the first time I met him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were at his brother Marlin's,</v>

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>have pool house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little house with just enough</v>

21
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>room for one big room on the first floor</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another big room on the second floor</v>

22
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>with a little tiny staircase between</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and there's a billiard table in the</v>

23
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>middle of the room and their arcade</v>
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

24
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>which at that point in particular in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1983,</v>

25
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were unattainable.</v>

26
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.460
<v Speaker 1>No human could afford arcade games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>unless you were Steve Wynn and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually equipping and arcade.</v>

28
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>So we're in the middle of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in this room and Michael and I are</v>

29
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:47.181
<v Speaker 1>standing next to each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so his elbow is that his left elbow is</v>

30
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>at my right elbow.</v>

31
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 1>His left knee is at my right knee and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a meeting with the art director</v>

32
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>from CBS.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm condensing the story,</v>

33
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 1>there's lots more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're having a meeting with the art</v>

34
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>director and she walks in with five of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most gorgeous portfolios you've ever</v>

35
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 1>seen in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hand carved Cherrywood,</v>

36
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>hand carved leather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are from guys I know because I</v>

37
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started in pop culture in the art</v>

38
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>business and these were my legendary</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitors and um,</v>

39
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 1>and Michael opens the first page of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first portfolio and he gets a square</v>

40
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.000
<v Speaker 1>inch into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a postage stamp sized piece into it.</v>

41
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

42
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Speaker 1>And his knees began to buckle and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets another two square inches into.</v>

43
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.890
<v Speaker 1>It just lifts the page a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>

44
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he lifts it up even further.</v>

45
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael was seeing the infinite in the</v>

46
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 1>things that even the artist didn't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with such infinity.</v>

47
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>As Michael is singing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by this time he gets to the full</v>

48
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's having a full scale aesthetic</v>

49
00:02:56.341 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>orgasm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have never seen anything like this in</v>

50
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember the first two rows of</v>

51
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>science are the truth at any price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the price of your life.</v>

52
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>And look at things run under right under</v>
<v Speaker 1>your nose as if you've never seen them</v>

53
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then proceed from there.</v>

54
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Michael is seeing the infinite in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiniest of things.</v>

55
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And you never seen a human with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree of awe,</v>

56
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>wonder and surprise anywhere in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

57
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.720
<v Speaker 1>And I will never see another human like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that again in my lifetime.</v>

58
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.340
<v Speaker 1>Michael was beyond belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>utterly beyond belief and his commitment</v>

59
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>to his audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his,</v>

60
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>the people he called his kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

61
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to turn this off.</v>

62
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.980
<v Speaker 2>A very different perspectives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>

63
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.870
<v Speaker 2>I booked this show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in six months.</v>

64
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 2>I need 40 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got to be.</v>

65
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.730
<v Speaker 2>And he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has told some of my stories and vice</v>

66
00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:47.120
<v Speaker 2>before getting drunk with sumo wrestlers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and different,</v>

67
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.130
<v Speaker 2>different stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much do you weigh?</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was joyous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>

72
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.280
<v Speaker 2>You've never seen anything like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>became big though.</v>

73
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

75
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.150

<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

76
00:04:05.151 --> 00:04:08.120

<v Speaker 2>So if you ever see us Sumal on TV that's</v>

<v Speaker 2>but he's also an entertainer,</v>

81
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 2>so he lives in Hollywood and he's very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very loose here.</v>

82
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

83
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.190
<v Speaker 2>He is a sumo wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:26.460
<v Speaker 2>There he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

85
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.620
<v Speaker 2>he is from Mongolia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he spends a great deal of time here</v>

86
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.760
<v Speaker 2>working as a television personality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actor and whatever,</v>

87
00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:36.770
<v Speaker 2>but he just looked fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

88
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:39.320
<v Speaker 2>he's got it looks jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like go to that one where he's doing the</v>

89
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Po's that are there.</v>

90
00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:41.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:44.990
<v Speaker 2>So that's like those shoulder muscles</v>
<v Speaker 2>through all that fat.</v>

92
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.520
<v Speaker 2>That guy looks like a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

93
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.580
<v Speaker 2>people don't realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but underneath there is like you or</v>

94
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:52.460
<v Speaker 2>underneath Eris like Tj dillashaw.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

95
00:04:52.461 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 2>There is a muscular person underneath</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those additional layers of fat and</v>

96
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 2>flush and skin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

97
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.540
<v Speaker 2>there was a powerful athlete and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real benefit and being that fat.</v>

98
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Force power generation like momentum.</v>

99
00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:09.890
<v Speaker 2>The ability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if the other guy is that big and</v>

100
00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:13.580
<v Speaker 2>our goal is just to smash into each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other until one of us has taken from the</v>

101
00:05:13.581 --> 00:05:15.350
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not that big.</v>

102
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.420
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

103
00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:21.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's like an arms race of size over</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations where they just got bigger</v>

104
00:05:21.981 --> 00:05:24.140
<v Speaker 2>and bigger out of necessity because if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're bigger,</v>

105
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.410
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to do?</v>

106
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 2>Go back to this thing and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tell me what has been the reaction,</v>

107
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 2>like when you take it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how you feed your scoring and just like</v>

108
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.150
<v Speaker 2>a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really do feel like you do you do</v>

109
00:05:35.151 --> 00:05:38.000
<v Speaker 2>feel more energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's because of the fencing</v>

110
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:42.080
<v Speaker 2>or is it possible that they just live</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the gen sing and that makes the</v>

111
00:05:42.081 --> 00:05:45.950
<v Speaker 2>story sexier for the website that sells?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think just eating the ants</v>

112
00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:49.250
<v Speaker 2>themselves give you haven't injury.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine that you'd have to catch</v>

113
00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 2>a lot of ants to get what you get out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all the powdered extract that they,</v>

114
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.570
<v Speaker 2>what they sell you.</v>

115
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I mean eating the powdered extract.</v>

116
00:05:55.701 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 2>Then just that somehow or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the mechanism for giving you</v>

117
00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.310
<v Speaker 2>energy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

118
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 2>there's some chemical that's in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ants.</v>

119
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 2>Hud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the mechanism of action.</v>

120
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.611
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

121
00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 2>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really don't claim to be an expert in</v>

122
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.330
<v Speaker 2>index extract,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you've got a bottle and I'm sure</v>

123
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a bottle of it was,</v>

124
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.560
<v Speaker 2>it was in with all my other supplements</v>
<v Speaker 2>in it and uh,</v>

125
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 2>I was packing up this morning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought it would be an interesting one.</v>

126
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 2>It is interesting to show it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a giant bottle of that says aunt on</v>

127
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:21.920
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the,</v>

128
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.580
<v Speaker 2>what's the standard way that people take</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to the daughter or as a tincture?</v>

129
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine you could probably put</v>

130
00:06:29.511 --> 00:06:30.570
<v Speaker 2>it in a smoothie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

131
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 2>with your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with your bee pollen,</v>

132
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>other insect derivatives.</v>

133
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

134
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:36.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

135
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 2>what a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

136
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.830
<v Speaker 2>And this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was young,</v>

137
00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 2>it was beating me up and the bus all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

138
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.730
<v Speaker 2>It was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really Collides me.</v>

139
00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I'd like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did that spence that you can tight</v>

140
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.950
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

141
00:06:47.951 --> 00:06:50.870
<v Speaker 2>I take enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I was that gun on dowhere and</v>

142
00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:54.010
<v Speaker 2>find everybody in front of a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was beating me up all the time and it</v>

143
00:06:54.011 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 2>was stronger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was like treat four years older than me</v>

144
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 2>and it was tall and strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>

145
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.690
<v Speaker 2>I'll keep layer back in the day and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't beat him.</v>

146
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.020
<v Speaker 2>It given him with Marshall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was always stronger than me.</v>

147
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 2>He hurt me a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like back in the day and so my dad,</v>

148
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 2>one time I was got beat up in the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told him because I came back with a</v>

149
00:07:14.331 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 2>black guy one time in my life.</v>

150
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I told my dad what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never said anything,</v>

151
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 2>but I sent my dad to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

152
00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:20.921
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up bus.</v>

153
00:07:20.921 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 2>He beat me up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell him the name of the guy.</v>

154
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>So my dad was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did</v>

155
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.980
<v Speaker 2>you found out where?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm from countryside so everybody knows</v>

156
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.440
<v Speaker 2>who everybody lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes to Dallas.</v>

157
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Know I can tell the dog to the Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

158
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 2>listen and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell your son to stop hitting my</v>

159
00:07:39.771 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Speaker 2>son in the bus because he need to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>focused on this school and that Dad,</v>

160
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 2>when my dad came back he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

161
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 2>I went to talk to his dad is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

162
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 2>So he said that is that it was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking and stuff and it was beating</v>

163
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 2>the shit out of his son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the way this guy learn to communicate</v>

164
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.650
<v Speaker 2>to his dad was beating up.</v>

165
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.250
<v Speaker 2>He was drunk and beating him up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the way it was communicate,</v>

166
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 2>communicating with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was beating me up because he learned</v>

167
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 2>that the same way from is that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>communicate.</v>

168
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:15.960
<v Speaker 2>So I was just happened to be at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

169
00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 2>right the wrong time at the right time</v>
<v Speaker 2>in his life at the perfect,</v>

170
00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was the guy that was getting beat.</v>

171
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 2>So when I say good and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not a bad person to my version of</v>

172
00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 2>life too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for my perspective.</v>

173
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 2>It was a terrible person back them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was terrible.</v>

174
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You and like many making my and my</v>

175
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 2>school time miserable man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't affiliated all the time.</v>

176
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 2>It was getting beat up and I had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very proud person.</v>

177
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 2>So I used to go fight him all the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was proud and at one point I</v>

178
00:08:48.591 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>fought him.</v>

179
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 2>So many times you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like this guy,</v>

180
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:53.130
<v Speaker 2>he's completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stop buttering him because I was never</v>

181
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.040
<v Speaker 2>good at giving up even though it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>beating,</v>

182
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>getting beat up all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to my arm eyes he was a bad person,</v>

183
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 2>but true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His eyes,</v>

184
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.880
<v Speaker 2>it was a different star.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We enjoy.</v>

185
00:09:01.881 --> 00:09:05.320
<v Speaker 2>His spotter was a different story today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody.</v>

186
00:09:05.321 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 2>It was a different story just to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that when I met him that way we talk</v>

187
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 2>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it feels so good just to meet him in the</v>

188
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 2>street and make kind of a piece and give</v>
<v Speaker 2>him money.</v>

189
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:15.751
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

190
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 2>you beat me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't.</v>

191
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though you did that,</v>

192
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.620
<v Speaker 2>I give you the money and I made me feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm kind of a revenge.</v>

193
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Better than a revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You make me feel like,</v>

194
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 2>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see without me,</v>

195
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't have nothing maybe to sleep</v>
<v Speaker 2>or eat tonight,</v>

196
00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:32.820
<v Speaker 2>so I give it to you.</v>

197
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 2>I still give it to you if you do that to</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

198
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.450
<v Speaker 2>that make me feel much better than if I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would like beat him up.</v>

199
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

200
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.110
<v Speaker 2>you ended up revaluing those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and that the,</v>

201
00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.930
<v Speaker 2>so that was a really important takeaway</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

202
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:51.110
<v Speaker 2>The other was having an experience of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ego dissolution that which can be scary,</v>

203
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:56.400
<v Speaker 2>can also be very blissful if it's then</v>
<v Speaker 2>followed by a merging with nature or</v>

204
00:09:56.401 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I do think that is the therapeutic</v>

205
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.900
<v Speaker 2>agent in these people who are healed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that our ego does keep us from</v>

206
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:11.460
<v Speaker 2>perceiving certain things and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>enforces really destructive stories.</v>

207
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 2>We tell ourselves like I can't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>through this day without a drink.</v>

208
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm unworthy of love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

209
00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the voice of self criticism all and we</v>

210
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:23.820
<v Speaker 2>get trapped in these loops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And especially as we get older.</v>

211
00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's one of the reasons I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics are actually more valuable</v>

212
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 2>the older you get because we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>creatures of habit.</v>

213
00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:33.200
<v Speaker 2>And by now we have these mental</v>
<v Speaker 2>algorithms that organize our,</v>

214
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our response to everything.</v>

215
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.170
<v Speaker 2>And sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's very efficient,</v>

216
00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:41.670
<v Speaker 2>but it blinds you to experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It blinds you to the every day,</v>

217
00:10:41.671 --> 00:10:45.170
<v Speaker 2>wonders and secondary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

218
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.590
<v Speaker 2>softens those habits and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

219
00:10:47.591 --> 00:10:52.530
<v Speaker 2>and helps you get out of those grooves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And for me that was really useful and</v>

220
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 2>it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the experience of ego</v>

221
00:10:55.951 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 2>dissolution that allows you to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because your ego enforces those habits</v>

222
00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 2>and you get a little break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a beautiful metaphor.</v>

223
00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 2>One of the scientists I interviewed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book,</v>

224
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 2>a Dutchman working in imperial college</v>
<v Speaker 2>in London,</v>

225
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:10.410
<v Speaker 2>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of your mind is a hill covered in</v>

226
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:15.411
<v Speaker 2>snow and your thoughts are sleds going</v>
<v Speaker 2>down that hill and after awhile after a</v>

227
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 2>lot of thoughts have gotten that hill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be these grooves.</v>

228
00:11:18.181 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 2>And then getting to get deeper and</v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper and a certain point,</v>

229
00:11:20.371 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 2>you can't go down the hill without</v>
<v Speaker 2>slipping into those groups.</v>

230
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.770
<v Speaker 2>That's who we are is we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

231
