WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.820
Still no main event for a mess.
Gregor?
No.
Four three,
two,
one

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.130
boo Ya,
Ya know,
main event from Madison Square Garden.

3
00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:13.730
So far the rumors were John Jones and Gustafson.

4
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.120
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.120
I Dunno why that hasn't materialized or they just waiting till announce it till

6
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.940
after the whole Connor could beep thing.
Why would they do that?

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.480
I think if they announced something that's gotta be this weekend,
I mean we're,

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.130
what isn't it November 3rd or something?
It's soon.
So it's a month.

9
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:35.000
Pursued my literally a month.
Today's the third right second.
Today's the second.

10
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:39.980
Today's the second.
Yeah.
Fuck man,
that ain't good.
I,
yeah,

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.640
maybe they just don't want to steal any shine from the Connor could beat,

12
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:47.000
but I don't know man.
I just don't have a card yet.

13
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.110
I think they were banking on Jones to for that main event.

14
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.210
It's been tricky to fill that slot.
But also why not have,
if,

15
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.590
if,
if you're going to do this,

16
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.650
why not announce Nate Diaz does import is your main event.

17
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:04.960
That's a great main event.
I can ride with that.
And then advanced,

18
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.080
then announced John Jones and Gus van or John Jones and Cain if you want to,

19
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.990
but the main event is to be announced versus to be determined.

20
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.000
The weirdest made a bit of everything.
I've never seen a fucking paper view.

21
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.001
I'm a month out that says to be announced versus to be determined in the main

22
00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:23.020
event.

23
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.650
<v 1>I mean they have somebody booked and then the not an opponent form and a nodding</v>

24
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:29.820
announcing it or is it just like decided to just be funny and write both?

25
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.340
<v 0>That's a very good point.
Just a good point.
Very good point.</v>

26
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:34.660
I would say they have no idea.
I think you just nailed the baby.

27
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.720
I think they have a guy that they want to fight.
Another guy I had heard a,

28
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.890
actually I heard from you

29
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.600
tried to do John Jones versus cane.
That was the rumor mill.

30
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.680
That little Birdie told me.
Yeah,
that would be,
I'm all over that.

31
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:54.840
I would be all over that car.

32
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.710
It's actually better than this weekend's card style benders fighting Derek

33
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.160
Brunson.
That's a great fight sleeper.

34
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.280
That's the sleeper on that card right there.
You got Luke Rockhold,
Chris Weidman.

35
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.530
<v 1>Ooh,</v>

36
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.440
<v 0>that's a good fight to gray David branching.</v>

37
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.680
Where is Rockpool Weidman on there?
The bottom middle,

38
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.360
but they're not in order yet.
Oh,
what?
This thing's all over the place.

39
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:21.680
Puzzle.
The guy who runs the UFC website took the month off.

40
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.460
Rockhold versus Weidman.
Very interesting that listen,

41
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.850
gay guard Musashi was that.

42
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.790
That guy is the fucking sleeper of the hundred 95 pound division.

43
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.020
The fact that he went over to Bella tour,
very fucking fascinating to me.

44
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.040
He just rec Roy MacDonald completely rectums type to watch.

45
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.930
Roy should not be fighting at 185 pounds,

46
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.610
especially against the guys fought at two oh five he's held titles at two Oh

47
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:49.070
five I agree.
And especially a guy in Gig harbor,

48
00:02:49.071 --> 00:02:51.620
we saucy who's just as talented just as skill.

49
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:54.860
Soon waving guns might be better in some other aspects.

50
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:56.510
Then when you go skill for skill,

51
00:02:56.511 --> 00:03:00.070
then size comes into play and you saw how that pans out.
Crush.
It says

52
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.210
<v 2>from Saas has a giant Dick.
How would he know who was in the sauna next to him?</v>

53
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.730
Oh,
that makes sense though.
You know what is a giant,

54
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.110
<v 0>she has that big Dick Energy.
He like he did.</v>

55
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.920
He just carries himself like a straight bad-ass the knee,

56
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.560
like nothing really gets them going.
You know why?

57
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.110
Because there's a giant Dick giant Dick.
You know what,

58
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.530
Burt Burt's probably ride on this.
God,
this makes sense.

59
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.320
You're brilliant.
Bert Kreischer while he it,

60
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.340
I mean it's not even like you figured it out.
I mean he,

61
00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:33.450
he's got like eye witness.
He's seen that there is in the room.

62
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.520
Nothing's ever made more sense than that.

63
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.220
He got hot cedar box with a big old sweaty Dick Dude that gay guard Amsterdam

64
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.600
did.
Everyone's like,

65
00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:45.480
how come he doesn't get more emotional cause he the fattest stick and they're

66
00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:48.740
horrible.
He swore it was bigger than his fucking water bottle

67
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.090
water bottle.
He goes,
dude,
I'm telling you

68
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.160
<v 2>it was giant.
I'm like,
wow.
All right,
that makes sense man.</v>

69
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.370
It does make a lot of sense.
Yeah,

70
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.990
but gay guide me Sassy not now bell tours in his string kind of predicament

71
00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.940
because they have that welterweight terminate going on.

72
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.330
Now you have your champion who's going to enter the tournament as the title

73
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:11.380
holder in the first round supposed to fight John Fitch who isn't an easy fight,

74
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:13.810
but he just coming off a loss and got destroyed.

75
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.530
And also it looks like you had some no's damage,
which was his issue before.
Yeah,

76
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.630
his nose had been fucked up for a long time and you know,

77
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:25.930
he decided to take a whole year off just to try to fix his nose.

78
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.940
Just try to let it heal.
That's serious.
Whole year off.
I mean you think about it,

79
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:35.941
that was like part of the delay in his initial fight in tour was that he left

80
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:39.790
the UFC.
You know his nose got smashed in the Robbie Lawler fight.

81
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:40.960
I mean it was hard to watch.

82
00:04:40.961 --> 00:04:44.140
Remember when he was in agony on the ground cause his nose just shattered.

83
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:46.870
They said every time we get to hit it just go white like sparks.

84
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:49.240
He couldn't see anything.
It was a bad injury.

85
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.920
He said there is one of the best fights of all time by the one that grades one

86
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:57.790
of the greatest fights.
He earned that shit.
Yeah.
But now,
uh,

87
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.080
with Rory,
you know what's sad too,
and that's happened to me.

88
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:05.530
It's happened to some other fighters.
I'm sure Roy,
he goes,
I just didn't get it.

89
00:05:05.531 --> 00:05:09.700
I just didn't feel like fighting.
I did.
I was in,
wasn't in the zone,

90
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.770
just didn't feel like fighting Gig army saucy that night.

91
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.890
Knowing Gay Guard saucy,
who's who,
he doesn't get enough recognition.

92
00:05:17.891 --> 00:05:20.890
How good that he,
he is absolute monster.

93
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.390
You've got to think about all the guys that he's beaten.
Oh,

94
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.300
he's on like a six or seven fight win streak,
which includes Chris Weidman.

95
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.230
Vito Belfort,
Talus latest,
um,
uhW,

96
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.250
who's the guy in Beltour,
the former champion.

97
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.260
Sheila Manco.
Uh,
sh yeah,
I was getting,
I always call,
I won't call him shift.

98
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:42.860
Chanko that's fucked up.
That's the girl

99
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.740
that he's an absolute nightmare.
A monster.
He's a monster.

100
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.470
I'm surprised the UFC let them go now when I say let them go,

101
00:05:50.471 --> 00:05:52.780
just didn't matches his contract,
you know,

102
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:55.830
cause belter probably offered more and they're like,
oh,
we're good.
Yeah.

103
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.210
You'll see.
Could use them right now.
Maybe five.

104
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.880
<v 0>Yeah.
Well,
I mean,
it's like they had Yoel Romero,</v>

105
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:03.890
they've got Robert Whitaker was a champ.

106
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:08.360
They've got so much going on at one 85 but gay guard might be the best.

107
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.870
I mean,
he's certainly in the running.
If you looked at it objectively,

108
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.480
it's entirely possible if he's not number one,
he's he's number two,

109
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.870
top three e's.
Number three.
Yeah,
but also you look at his fight.

110
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.840
If him and Robert Whitaker would a fight,

111
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.260
that's not an easy pick them file.
You would have to be like,
damn,

112
00:06:27.261 --> 00:06:29.960
that's a fucking fight.
You might favorite cake art.

113
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.020
You don't know how big and long and scrappy person,
listen,

114
00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:37.900
Robert Whitaker is a monster.
He's phenomenal.
I mean,
but so it was Mu Saucy,

115
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.990
so it was Musashi and we saucy has a full game man.

116
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:45.590
His crown game is phenomenal and the biggest dick in the division,
giant Dick.

117
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:48.160
There's stuff that has to be taken into consideration at all.

118
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.700
This might be now eos.
I bet it's bigger.
No Way.
I bet it's no bro.

119
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.220
He doesn't care.
That energy is too aggressive.
What's,
yeah,

120
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.120
when you're that aggressive,
you don't have that fat.

121
00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.640
He looks like that and doesn't have a big Dick.
I don't know,
Dude.
See Batman,

122
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.230
Batman,
the comic drew a Dick and he's,
that's Batman.
You know what I'm saying?

123
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.860
Yeah.
Batman has a dick now.
That's the new comic.
There's like this new,

124
00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:13.940
like kind of x rated Batman they're coming out with and they show Batman's Dick.

125
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.510
That's how I pictured.
This isn't even Yoel Romero,

126
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.553
millennials.

127
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.300
These are just fucking millennials that think they're going to rewrite history

128
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:25.850
there.
Make an iron man a woman.
They're crazy.
Yeah.

129
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.000
It's just people are out of their fucking mind.
Captain America's now a woman.

130
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.160
Yeah.
Well,
I'm just saying iron man's probably gay.
Everyone's,
it's this,

131
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:39.110
there's a weird revolution right now in comics because,
uh,
they're trying to,
uh,

132
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:44.480
sort of social justice,
warrior up all the comedy,
all the comic books.

133
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.190
What do you laugh at?
That it is true.
It is true.
All cogans.
Uh,

134
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.730
I'll get this DC comics,
sorry for showing everyone that man's penis.

135
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.980
That's y'all.
Romil Bro.
Yo,
it's real.
That's not real.

136
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:01.780
So that's a comic book and it's a comic book.
That's by the way,

137
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.300
was created in like,
what was,
let's just take a guess.
When Batman was created,

138
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:08.900
I'm going to guess like 1940 when he thinks super old school,

139
00:08:08.901 --> 00:08:13.901
1940 1950s I can't rewrite Batman's Dick and 2018 the guy drawing it,

140
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.860
I didn't have the biggest day.
Kelly is tiny little and just mad,

141
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.840
but maybe he thought that was massive.

142
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:22.520
Probably thought was the biggest dick he's ever seen.

143
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.580
He had a scared to watch porn and then,
and they got backlash and he's like,

144
00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:30.290
what the fuck at this was a big cock and was like,
no dude,
I for Batman's Batman,

145
00:08:30.291 --> 00:08:34.190
you pray that mans the weirdest superhero ever because he's basically just a

146
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:38.890
rich guy.
But he's Ilan Musk well on steroids and can fight.
He's,
he must,

147
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:43.190
yeah,
basically that's what he is with a bunch of stuff.
No special skills,

148
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.020
but he knows how to fight,
but he doesn't have any superpower,
just nothing.

149
00:08:48.021 --> 00:08:51.680
He's still rich,
dude.
That's why I got angry at that Batman versus superman.

150
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.290
Superman would.
First of all,

151
00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:59.040
he moves so fast he could make the earth spin backwards and reverse time to his

152
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:02.010
lasers in his eyes for gut.
There's no vibe

153
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.450
pseudo to cryptonite.

154
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.880
Superman would fuck him up before you even got the suit on him to files Lex

155
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:18.700
Luthor Valliant like the adversary for him.
That's not okay.
He just,
his board,

156
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.780
it keeps that to the round like a side piece.

157
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.830
Let's have some fun,
dude.
He's like,
let this guy pertains kicking my ass.

158
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.700
Venom drops this weekend.
Tom Hardy.
You know what?

159
00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:35.760
Maybe I'm just a Debbie Downer,
but I don't,
I don't know.

160
00:09:35.761 --> 00:09:40.761
It looks all right to me and I love when I love Tom Hardy to venom is like on

161
00:09:41.461 --> 00:09:45.900
evil Spiderman.
Like what is that?
He's like Spiderman.
It's alien.

162
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:50.390
It's an alien.
It's an alien element.
They grabbed someone's body.

163
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.350
That merchants with his body.
Yeah,
and he's evil.
I don't know.

164
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.970
Fuck your kids today.
I know.
I know,
man.
I know.
I mean,

165
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.800
I guess it's better than remaking the Hawk for the 98th time.
I'll take it.

166
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.560
I mean,
how many Spiderman's are there now?
It's like 80 Spiderman.

167
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.480
Whenever Spiderman starts making some money,
they go like,
Nah,

168
00:10:11.481 --> 00:10:16.110

Right.

171
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.260
What is it that you've been to one guy that never even got any traction?

Sorry Tom.
They wanted to make sure your wonderful,

173
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.740
they want to make Donald Glover splatter majors.

174
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.690
I think he's the voice in this cartoon they just announced today.

175
00:10:36.691 --> 00:10:40.340
This comes out this into the spider first get stunning new trailer.

Head of New York comic con.
I was talking to Chris Pratt about comicon.

177
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.260
What'd he say?
You know,

178
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.290
cause he's got to go there for guardians of the galaxy and he's probably like

179
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.260
fun,
tough.
He's like,
he goes,
hi,

180
00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.030
And I just said to myself,
I don't belong here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a different vibe.

181
00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.280
He is the nicest guy.
He goes to a bunch of UFC events.
Yeah.
Yeah.

182
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.030
He's been to one.
It was only at one.

183
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.600
Is that where you talked to him at the fucking,
he came hunting with us and Utah.

Good Hunter.

Real good.
Good Archer.
And people forget.

186
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:18.120
He started off as a comedian actor.

187
00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:22.380
Like he was like the funny guy.
What was that show?
He was on the office.

188
00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:26.190
Parks and parks.
Pudgy.
Yeah.
Back then.

189
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.350
Now he's all jacked and it weird tone was like,

190
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.990
you're going to be the next action here.
And he's like,
what?

191
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.440
Here's a boat load of let's do that.
I don't even think it was that.

192
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:36.750
I think he just lost the weight and everybody went,
Oh,
you know,

193
00:11:36.751 --> 00:11:40.580
he was a wrestler in high school and college.
Was He really a college?
Yeah.
Yeah.

194
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:45.650
Good wrestler.
He took,
I cannot assault.
I saw him wrestling with Nogueira.
Yeah,

195
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.630
he actually looked pretty good.
Who's wrestling with Nogueira?
Yeah,

196
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.930
there's video of him wrestling the guy.
Yeah.
And I was like,
damn,

197
00:11:51.931 --> 00:11:55.660
that dude knows what he's doing.
I,
I had no idea.
He was a,
you know,
wrestling,

198
00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.720
I squat on a farm in a like outside of Seattle and raises animals and I actually

199
00:12:04.331 --> 00:12:07.690
has like a farm,
like a,
a real,
um,

200
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:13.300
I think the way that co just like very humane,
ethical treatment of the animals.

201
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.900
Like the animals are all like super adjusted to human beings.

202
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:18.010
And then when they whack them,

203
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.760
they just take them into a room and put one in their brain and he does it.

204
00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:25.330
Or this is just his crate.
It's him and Nogueira.
Yeah.
Linked to this,
but for,

205
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.730
you know,
I had no idea.
I just thought he was a normal actor.

206
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.800

210
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:43.090
I don't know what he's looking at paying that guy.

211
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:44.920
That guy's making $20 million a movie.

212
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.390
How the fuck are you going to pay him for that?

The Harry Potter ride,

234
00:13:57.851 --> 00:14:00.390
if you take a little man to the Harry Potter ride,
it's not picking up still.

235
00:14:00.391 --> 00:14:01.960
He's only two and a half.
That's right.

236
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.780
I think you have to be like 40 inches or some shit.
But the Jurassic,

237
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.320
the Jurassic Park ride is whack.
You know what's great?

You know what?

242
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:26.720
Surprisingly good.
Knott's berry farms it.
Uh,
it's very old school.

243
00:14:26.721 --> 00:14:31.000
A little vintage.
Some of the fucking rides are amazing to me.
They're a little,

244
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:35.050
the little suspect like a year ago,
like the suspect,
like they might break.
Yeah,

245
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.980
like the wood roller goes from like really

246
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.820

Like when's the last time?
So in check,

247
00:14:43.821 --> 00:14:44.890
dad didn't go on that one,

248
00:14:44.891 --> 00:14:48.130
but I went on one where you're sitting in your seat like this,
right?

249
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:53.030
And then you go like this clink.
He goes up so your back,

250
00:14:53.031 --> 00:14:53.930
like if you fell,

251
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:58.370
you would fall right on your balance over and then you get to the top and you

252
00:14:58.371 --> 00:15:01.380
pause and then they turn you like this and it is.
Yeah,

253
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.740
it was the best rollercoasters I've ever been on knots,
skeptical,

254
00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:12.860
Hipaa us because when he get there,
their whole theme is Charlie Brown.

255
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:15.950
It's like who the fuck's watching Charlie Brown these days?

256
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.700
Everyone has to this Spiderman,
marvel.
Disney would make you,

257
00:15:19.701 --> 00:15:23.630

I'm like kids like who the fuck is?
Notice Charlie Brown.

258
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.950
It was all like there's a wild west theme area.
Oh,

259
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:33.740
But they're,
their main slogan is Charlie Brown.
Well,

260
00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.400
Good time,

You know what a,
I'll tell you what though.

261
00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.640
All overall best ride I've ever been on 100% is Disney world.

262
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.180
The Jurassic not to dress apart.
The avatar ride,

263
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.800
the Avatar ride in Orlando.
All right.
It's called flights of passage.

264
00:15:51.801 --> 00:15:56.090
I think it is.
Dude bought beyond the greatest ride ever.

265
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.930
It's all virtual reality.
You climb into like a chair,

266
00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.400
like you're on a motorcycle,

267
00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.990
it pushes against your back and you settle into this thing and then you put

268
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:10.190
these goggles on with this headset thing on and you're in full virtual reality

269
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:15.050
and this is it.
And you,
the listener,
this is the one where you're on the boat.

270
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.680
There's two actual avatar rides.
This one's pretty dope too.
That looks legit.

271
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.660
It looks like Avatar world.
Yeah,
this one.
That's pretty dope too.
That one.

272
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:27.560
You're on a boat like pirates of the Caribbean.
Yeah.
This is it.
I liked the boat.

273
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:29.510
The boat's pretty bad ass.
But this one,

274
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:33.680
you're flying in full virtual reality while you're riding on the back of one of

275
00:16:33.681 --> 00:16:36.790
those drag and things.
I mean,
I've seen better graphics on,
but no,
no,
no.

276
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.950
And what you're just not getting isn't doing it.
Know when you're there.

277
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.980
Yeah.
They filmed their screen.
They're not even filming this scream in three d.

278
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.780
Right.
So he's just using his cell phone.

279
00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:51.740
That's why it looks all blurry is a long line.
Long as shit,

280
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.500
as long as shit.
And then while you're doing it,

281
00:16:54.501 --> 00:16:59.270
like you get breezes in your face and you smell things,
it's fucking incredible,

282
00:16:59.271 --> 00:17:03.290
man.
It feels real.
It's the best ride I've ever been on by far.
Like I got it.

283
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:08.630
I've been on some dope rods.
That's Numero Uno with a bullet by far.
By far.
Hello?

284
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.750
Yeah,
I did it two times in a row,
dude.
I'm a sucker for the,
I'm old school.

285
00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:16.690
I like the haunted mansion.
Battered old school lens man.
And then they put in a,

286
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:21.140
um,
what is it,
a nightmare.
Before Christmas.
Yeah.
Jack.
Yeah,

287
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.770
right around around Halloween time.
Yeah.
I love Halloween.
I love it.

288
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:30.220
Yeah.
Have you taken him to Disneyland yet?
Oh yeah.
Season Pass.
Oh,

289
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.920
that's the shit,
right?
I feel like he's getting spoiled because,
you know,

290
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.870
when I'm working in my girl,
I take him and her friends and they go,

291
00:17:35.871 --> 00:17:40.340
he's going when he's not in school,
he's in school now,
but two times a week.

292
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.270
Oh yeah.
They go just to chill,
a little dewy screwed when it gets old.

293
00:17:46.271 --> 00:17:49.800
And I know that is so spoiled.
It was such a big deal when I was a kid.

294
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.150
It was such a big deal.
You go with Joey Diaz and Joey's family.

295
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:58.100
Did you go with Joey Now Sandy?
Oh that's right.
Anyway.
Yeah,

296
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.840
that's gotta be a trip.
Yeah.
Fun.

297
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:04.770
Disneyland's when you have kids becomes a totally different thing.

298
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.340
It's a special place.
Yeah.
I was like,
before I had kids,
I was like,

299
00:18:08.341 --> 00:18:12.570
I'm not going to fuck you man.
You know,
like if I was 20 and someone said,

300
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:15.690
hey man,
you want to go to Disneyland and be like,
why?
What are we going to do?

301
00:18:15.691 --> 00:18:18.310
We're going to ride a roller coaster and wait for an hour and a half little

302
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:22.760
funnel cake and suck each other off.
What's wrong with him and those,
um,

303
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.950
one of those fucking,
those the ones,
the brown sugar do I low,

304
00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:32.710
nice Cherrelle got damn.
Those are hard to pass up the style,
dude.

305
00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.310
You can't be on a diet and go to Disneyland.
It's hard.

306
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.010
They have a kitchen wrongs roasted almonds.
The churros do?
No,

307
00:18:41.011 --> 00:18:43.890
not sure about like the,
if you had the stamp machines.
Yeah,

308
00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.860
they have like the candy.
Uh,
almonds know what they want.

309
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.540
Have one thing that's guilt free though,

310
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.890
that big old Turkey leg that's smoked Turkey leg makes me feel sick when I see

311
00:18:52.891 --> 00:18:57.891
just these enormous people just challen down and then the p meets all pink in

312
00:18:57.901 --> 00:19:02.040
the middle for a reason.
Well it's smoked.
Is everyone out of shape?

313
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.750
Disneyland shape their ambulatory?
I'll dude.
Yeah.

314
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.140
There's more people that can't walk there just on scooters because they got so

315
00:19:10.141 --> 00:19:14.760
big,
their body just stopped moving.
God.
Yeah.
It's a strange vibe though.

316
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.340
You can't be on a diet and go to an amusement park.

317
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.980
You've got to accept that you're gonna fuck off that day for sure.

318
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.920
That's a fuck off day.
That's like,
we're going to get some ice cream.

319
00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:25.510
I'm a drink a regular soda.
Oh,

320
00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.590
well do I tell you where else she can't be on a diet at Chicago.

321
00:19:28.591 --> 00:19:33.180
I was there a few weeks ago.
Fuck it.
Go to Illuminati eight every pizza.

322
00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.720
And I apologize to every crowd beforehand.
That is not a pizza.

323
00:19:36.721 --> 00:19:40.250
That was a Goddamn casserole.
It is a straight,
it's the casserole.
It's a,

324
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:43.890
it's a pie.
It's a pie.
It's a pie.
I do.
And I felt so sick after that,

325
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:49.380
but it was so nice going down.
I felt so sick.
That's a weird sacrifice.
Right?

326
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.820
You decide I'm going to be sick for a few hours for just a few seconds of mouth.

327
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:57.560
Pleasure.
Yeah.
Like again,
I apologize for the crowds.
I'm like,

328
00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.290
shouldn't be doing this man.
This is this.
Take a fighter missing weight.

329
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.820
Like it's such an asshole move.
My face is all swollen from the sodium.

330
00:20:05.821 --> 00:20:09.990
They'll go,
oh,
look at,
uh,

331
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:15.330
which one was that?
That was at the place where uh,
it's the famous place.

332
00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.370
Um,
the grinder,

333
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:21.660
the grinder where it comes in a bowl and it's where a cracker is that is a gay,

334
00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.780
that's an 80 case site.
Yeah.
But it's also a delicious pizza.

335
00:20:24.781 --> 00:20:27.930
Chicago concept grinder often in grind of and grinder.

336
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:32.570
I wonder if they're bummed out that grinder as well.
All mother fucking,

337
00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:36.690
and they thought you're going to get a deep dish and a blowjob dish.
Bitch,

338
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:43.520
but uh,
it's that same place where Al Capone and his men,
uh,
uh,

339
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.290
staked out before they did the Saint Valentine's Day massacre.

340
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:51.550
So it's like a storage place.
Yeah.
So it's old as fuck.
Two hour.
Wait.
Whoa.

341
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.110
Wait.
You waited two hours for food?
Two hours away.

342
00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:00.250
It's a two hour wait.
I put my name and strolled around a good move.

343
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:03.410
I know you gotta do what you gotta do that.
No,
there's no freebies there.

344
00:21:03.411 --> 00:21:07.060
I don't give a fuck.
That's a lot of food,
man.
They don't fuck around.

345
00:21:07.061 --> 00:21:08.590
People get cold.
That's the thing.

346
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:12.700
If you live in a place where people get cold like Boston or Chicago,

347
00:21:12.701 --> 00:21:15.900
people get thick.
These take this.
Yeah.
They get,

348
00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.480
it's tough to work out in the cold man.
No.
Well not just that.
It like,

349
00:21:19.481 --> 00:21:21.990
it insulates you.
I that makes sense.
If you want to live in them,

350
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.270
don't want to be shredded.
Shredded near that water.

351
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:30.340
The wind comes off that lake.
Oh,
sense you've been Chicago in January.

352
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:34.480
Yes.
Woo.
Miserable as fuck.
Not My cup of tea.

353
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.390
It's great place to perform though.
Yeah.
Latinos are amazing.
Amazing.
There.

354
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:40.660
They're just fun.
They're fun people.
You know what they are.

355
00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.340
They're a unique combination of like the Midwest and a giant city.

356
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.460
Same as Toronto.
Toronto is like that too of Toronto,

357
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.420
but it's the same kind of vibe.
It's a weird combination of like really nice,

358
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.620
almost small town people that live in a giant urban city and Toronto is a

359
00:21:58.871 --> 00:22:02.530
melting pot.
It is just,
to me,
Toronto reminds me of New York,

360
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.600
not with the hustle and cleaner.
Yeah,
wait,

361
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:10.660
I loved her more polite people too and it's way nicer.
You get Indian people,

362
00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:14.860
Pakistani,
black,
Asian,
white,

363
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.460
European mean you'd get everybody on the other end of that.

364
00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:23.080
I was just in Seattle,
Washington and the crowd was all white,

365
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:27.320
all white.
That is the,
was the darkest dude in the,
in the building.
Damn.

366
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:30.640
In Portland,
they're white as fuck.
Even if you're black.

367
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:33.670
After a few generations you just turn white and you start talking.

368
00:22:33.671 --> 00:22:34.240
Like if you're,

369
00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.470
if you bring your family up there and you plan on sticking out of black

370
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:40.780
existence in Portland,
good luck.
Good luck.

371
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:45.990
If even if your kids only date other black kids test or like a hundred years,

372
00:22:46.211 --> 00:22:51.211
everyone's going to be 101 there's no sun that sun for three months a year,

373
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.410
that there's a reason why people became white.

374
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.300
I mean everyone really comes from Africa.

375
00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.720
It's one of the real reasons why racism is so stupid.

376
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.360
Every single fucking human being came from Africa,

377
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.970
just like every single fucking dog came from a wolf.

378
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.060
Every person started out as an African.

379
00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:10.960
It's just as we moved to shittier and shittier places with less and less sun,

380
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.640
your body adapted and you basically,
white skin is like,
uh,

381
00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:20.620
a big ole solar panel for vitamin B or Vitamin D rather.

382
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.700
I don't,
and obviously we don't,
I don't know anyone who is racist these days.

383
00:23:24.701 --> 00:23:27.640
Still out there for sure.
But I don't,
I don't,

384
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.210
I don't want to have anyone that I even,
you know,

385
00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:35.920
associates Niven but even like jokingly or like I don't like Asians and I don't

386
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:39.610
like,
I don't that is exotic.
No,
no,
no,

387
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.540
not any that are doing well.
No,
it's a stupid mindset.

388
00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:48.560
It's a stupid mindset.
It just really is.
It's dumb.
Just as,

389
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.720
I mean,
it's very old school.
While it's just,
it's,

390
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.900
it doesn't benefit you in any way.

391
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:57.980
It's super detrimental for your view of the world,

392
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.060
the way you interact with people.
It's just,
it's dumb.
I mean,

393
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:06.260
I know so many cool people of every single race.
Like what,
you know,
I mean,

394
00:24:06.261 --> 00:24:11.261
why would you like judge and white people off of a few small portion sample size

395
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:16.400
of like mass shooters?
The dumb is shoot up the high schools.
Well,

396
00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.060
this,
you know,
there's like blow back the other way,
right?

397
00:24:20.061 --> 00:24:22.820
Like there's a lot of people think it's okay to be racist against white people

398
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.030
because so many white people have been racist in the past,

399
00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:29.680
but that's just as foolish and just as short sighted.
It's different.
Yeah.

400
00:24:29.681 --> 00:24:34.310
It's all stupid.
It's like today with all this meat to stuff,
um,

401
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.340
it seems like it's okay to be sexist against men because there are awful men out

402
00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:44.510
there,
but there's also men.
They're nice and they're going to be nice to you.

403
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.990
There's also some awful women out there who do have other agendas when they come

404
00:24:47.991 --> 00:24:51.860
out with these.
Me Too.
Claims there's a lot of that what you're seeing.
I mean,

405
00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.020
we're seeing these cases now,
you know,

406
00:24:54.021 --> 00:24:58.880
we're seeing these cases get exposed for what they are,
you know,
and it,
it,
it,

407
00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.200
the problem is that it casts doubt on legitimate cases.

408
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:04.940
What is going on with my throat?

409
00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:10.250
Something about these goddamned caveman coffee's really early in the morning.

410
00:25:11.690 --> 00:25:16.340
I'm good though.
Sometimes.
I know you think you thought,
did you think,

411
00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:20.270
uh,
if you're in Lucy case shoes,
do you think he came back too soon?

412
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.240
I don't think it's that he came back too soon.

413
00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:28.650
And what I honestly think is he should say something more than what he already

414
00:25:29.061 --> 00:25:34.010
said,
not just fill up like it's all good.
And like,
right.
There's not just,
I mean,

415
00:25:34.011 --> 00:25:37.430
he said he put out a release a statement.
These stories are true.

416
00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.120
They happened a long time ago.
Right?
They happen like more than a decade ago.

417
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:43.790
I think he should.

418
00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:48.770
And I think it might be even better to release a video rather than,

419
00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:52.700
um,
than a written statement because a written statement,

420
00:25:52.701 --> 00:25:56.630
the problem is like it's impersonal.
It's personal.
Fake.
Yeah.
Well it's not even,

421
00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.050
not only that,
it's,
it's,
it's not as impactful.
I want us,

422
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:03.380
what is he going to say?
It's like I can't fix it.

423
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.470
Maybe if he donated a certain amount of money to certain causes or you know,

424
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.240
spent,
you know,
time in therapy or talked about it and it's,

425
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:18.590
and maybe expressed himself and said that.
What was,

426
00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:23.480
you know,
what was going on through,
through,

427
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:28.130
through in his mind during that time when he did the thing and why it was wrong

428
00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:32.390
and how he's changed his,
his way and how bad he feels about it.

429
00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:34.460
How he's apologized and has daughters,
I think,

430
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.700
I think you could get all that done by just doing a video with his,

431
00:26:37.701 --> 00:26:41.540
I think it would go so much further for him if he didn't have a big production,

432
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:44.340
nothing.
And he's a creative dude.
Obviously a great comedian.

433
00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.400
If you just went off the top of his head straight into the camera and posted on

434
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.570
Instagram,
I was like,
hey man,
I've paid a price.
I've learned.

435
00:26:51.571 --> 00:26:54.810
I have daughters is a horrible thing that I did.
I mean,
even stay away from,

436
00:26:54.811 --> 00:26:57.210
I've paid a price because people don't really want to hear that shit.

437
00:26:57.211 --> 00:27:01.010
Like what is the price?
But they don't think he has.
Well,
they're crazy,

438
00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:04.140
but a lot of people,
millions of dollars,
they don't realize that.
They think,
oh,

439
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:04.651
he's fine.

440
00:27:04.651 --> 00:27:07.350
He should get back down the road and touring is going to be a millionaire.
Well,

441
00:27:07.351 --> 00:27:11.700
he slides a ton of shit,
ton of money off his shows.
Fx Deal.

442
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.420
More importantly,
his daughters have this image of him being,

443
00:27:15.421 --> 00:27:19.210
this guy jerks off in front of women.
That's never going to go away.
No,
that's,

444
00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:23.790
that's a pretty heavy stamp,
which is deserved.
Maybe not.

445
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.350
Maybe not forever,
but,
but it's,
it's a complicated issue.
You know,

446
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.580
it's complicated.
Like what was his psychology?

447
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:33.600
What was going on in his mind that that allowed him to do that apparently just

448
00:27:33.601 --> 00:27:37.110
started going up again.
He just went up again Sunday night.
Yeah,
he just went,

449
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.800
he went up and I guess the,
the owner of the club was like,
dude,

450
00:27:40.801 --> 00:27:43.050
I didn't know I was asleep and he went up.
You know,

451
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:45.420
it's the crowds discretion if they want to stay or leave.

452
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:47.560
But well the first time the,

453
00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:52.530
the owner was upset in the second time they said something along the lines of if

454
00:27:52.531 --> 00:27:56.310
anyone has an issue with someone who stops in Aka Louie.

455
00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.790
I mean it's only Louie,
maybe Aziz I guess really well

456
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:04.910
some people got upset about it as east to still do,

457
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.710
to look at people just like targets.

458
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.950
They like targets that they like negativity,

459
00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:13.410
they like negativity but they also like targets

460
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.220
when they find someone who a viable target,

461
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.750
someone who's done something they can criticize and then Kelly,
you,

462
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:25.450
what have you done?
Oh,
you're still alive.
You know,

463
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:30.720
there's people that just want to decide that someone's a horrible person and it,

464
00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:33.990
and they don't have this really well thought out,

465
00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:39.300
comprehensive view of the situation.
They just attack.
You know,

466
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.010
there's a lot of those people out there,
man,

467
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:42.630
and they think that they're justified,

468
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:46.470
particularly if that person is famous and they're not.
They think it's fair game.

469
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.270
Yup.
Published form.
And so people were definitely upset at Aziz,
but much,

470
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.890
much more upset about Louie.
Oh,

471
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:57.360
100% when you stop and think about what Louis actually did.
Creepy.
Yes.

472
00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.320
Asked women if he could jerk off in front of them.
They said yes,
he did it.

473
00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.770
If they said no,
he didn't.
I mean it's,
it's fucking,
look,

474
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:06.660
if you're working with a guy like that and he's like,

475
00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:08.970
can I jerk off in front of me like Jesus Christ,

476
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.820
he imagined what the fuck it would be.
Shitty work environment for sure.

477
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.800
And he is not handsome Louie.
I love you.
Brutal to list.

478
00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.980
You know what I'm saying?
He's harsh on the eyes.
Yeah.

479
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.750
Brad Pitt's asking to jack off in front of you.
Not that it's ever right,

480
00:29:24.751 --> 00:29:28.530
but it do less on the,
it's in the feelings of Brad Pitt's.

481
00:29:28.531 --> 00:29:32.880
Yank it in front of you.
I mean all of it.
All of it's no Bueno.

482
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:37.740
It's a whole mess.
I mean,
he obviously had some sort of a weird kink,
you know,

483
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:39.690
I wonder what that is.
Probably started in childhood,

484
00:29:39.691 --> 00:29:42.310
maybe got caught and then got off on it and,
right,
right.

485
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.670
Or you just never got chicks and now he has this power because he's such a,

486
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:48.250
he didn't have the power when he started doing it though.
Man,

487
00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:52.240
when he started doing it,
it wasn't a really famous,
he was respected,

488
00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:56.740
but he was like,
no.
Which is some,

489
00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.650
you know,
it's,
it's awful.
But it's,

490
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.310
it's just the thing that he stuck with now.

491
00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:06.880
So he's got to figure out how to ingratiate himself.

492
00:30:06.881 --> 00:30:11.881
He's got to figure out how to to re emerge and I think he can do it.

493
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:18.100
I think you can do it,
can do it.
Look,
he's not an awful person.

494
00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.520
I just think he did some stupid things that were really gross and weird.

495
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:26.610
But if he just,
I mean he and he has owned up to it.
I think he just,
you know,

496
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:31.690
it makes some sort of a sincere apology and then does something like what could

497
00:30:31.901 --> 00:30:34.870
you do to to,
I mean,
what do you help?

498
00:30:34.871 --> 00:30:38.500
Female comics maybe do a duo has done that.
He's tried to help,

499
00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:41.830
but a lot of people accused him of trying to help them to try to cover up his

500
00:30:41.831 --> 00:30:45.640
tracks.
Well,
fuck man,
you got to yes.
To do something.

501
00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:51.370
He gets to go back to work.
Yeah.
I mean it's been a year now,
right?

502
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.570
It's a year,
next month.

503
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.920
I think to expect him to just never work again seems ridiculous.

504
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.520
It's going to not forgive him.

505
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:05.700
There has to be a path to redemption for anyone who's done anything other than

506
00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:10.840
actual rape or murder.
Right.
Like for Bill Cosby,

507
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:13.570
I'm very happy it's locked up.
I think what he did is awful.

508
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:17.080
Can you imagine being one of those girls that turn to him as a mentor and you

509
00:31:17.081 --> 00:31:19.060
wake up and you,
you know,
you're,

510
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.180
you've been violated while you're out cold and you're dragged and you're

511
00:31:22.181 --> 00:31:26.170
confused and bill Cosby did it to you and who the fuck is going to believe that

512
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.550
his image is?
That's the thing about Louis,
right?
Like Louise Image was like,

513
00:31:30.551 --> 00:31:33.190
he's a pervert.
He's a Weirdo.
He's always talking about jerking off.

514
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.650
Like when you found out Louis CK ass got girls,

515
00:31:35.651 --> 00:31:37.240
if he could jerk off in front of them and did it,

516
00:31:37.241 --> 00:31:40.990
it's like not the most surprising.
No,
but with bill Cosby,

517
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.790
it's,
here's a guy who is,
and I'm not comparing the,

518
00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.470
the acts at all,

519
00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.490
but I'm just saying as far as like famous people who have done something that,

520
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.610
you know,
became a scandal,
would bill with bill Cosby,

521
00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.010
he was this moral guy.

522
00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.720
He was this like ethics guy and he wore a sweater or his dad.

523
00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.890
He was America's Dad.

524
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:06.400
And to find out that that guy was drugging and raping women.

525
00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.460
He's in fucking jail right now,
which is crazy.
Right?
He's going to die.

526
00:32:11.461 --> 00:32:15.930
I give it over under a week.
Do you think the way it goes with those old dudes?

527
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:20.220
Really?
Yeah.
He's 81.
His eyes are show crazy.
You can't see,

528
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:24.360
I think the one's good,
but the last ones all over the goddamn place.

529
00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:28.010
Which one is the one I thought the right one was wearing.
Ah,
it's,

530
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:31.470
I think it's this one,
but it is fucking look in the wrong.

531
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:36.260
What's going on in its own way?
Yeah.
That's what you get,
man.
It's yeah,

532
00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:38.550
I'm going to die any day now.
I think,
um,

533
00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:43.760
I a path to redemption or a path to retribution would be,

534
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.930
uh,
would be good.
A path to forgiveness.
That's,

535
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:49.780
that's the thing that's important for

536
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:52.130
<v 3>all right.</v>

537
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:56.860
<v 0>All human beings who've made mistakes.
I think we cast people out if they've made</v>

538
00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.960
<v 2>mistakes.
I agree.
I still think it's important to,</v>

539
00:32:58.961 --> 00:33:03.280
with all this stuff is like Louis C K got lumped in with the big dogs like bill

540
00:33:03.281 --> 00:33:07.420
Cosby and Harvey Weinstein.
Then there's still only see k and man,

541
00:33:07.421 --> 00:33:10.630
there was definitely different levels to this.
Yes.

542
00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:13.390
These fucking crack question.
No question.

543
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:16.230
How about one that flies under the radar,
especially here in America.

544
00:33:16.231 --> 00:33:18.310
And I was just reading about it,
how true it is.

545
00:33:18.311 --> 00:33:22.990
Who knows is with a Ronaldo who you know,
and in soccer,
ash,
Ash,

546
00:33:22.991 --> 00:33:25.620
your boy,
uh,
in,
in Edwards,
I mean there's,

547
00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:29.680
there's a super superstar superstar.
It would be like a,

548
00:33:29.681 --> 00:33:32.440
it'd basically be like Connor McGregor getting caught doing something for in our

549
00:33:32.441 --> 00:33:36.160
world,
you know,
like it's a big deal.
This is a new one.
Yeah.
This,
this girl,

550
00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:39.720
you know,
he said,
she said he kept telling him no,
and then he ain't,

551
00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:44.730
he raped her and then a paid or a $375,000 to keep quiet and now she's coming

552
00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:50.770
back out.
But who knows?
Human beings

553
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:57.240
capable of such amazing things and such fucking awful things might have to look

554
00:33:57.241 --> 00:33:59.850
that up.
Jamie.
I might've been drained.
I think you're right about that.

555
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.770
My brother told me about it.
He's usually on it.

556
00:34:01.771 --> 00:34:04.590
That's what I just read in the New York Post.
Yeah.

557
00:34:04.591 --> 00:34:08.280
We should probably go back to fights,
right?
We're not aleks that booty.
Uh,
yeah,

558
00:34:08.281 --> 00:34:09.800
we should go back to fight.
So,
I don't know.

559
00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:12.903
<v 3>Hmm.</v>

560
00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:16.270
<v 0>Did outside of you about your,
your special being dropped today?
Nervous at all?</v>

561
00:34:16.450 --> 00:34:18.830
I was nervous before.
Yeah.
You're nervous about it?
Um,
yeah,

562
00:34:18.910 --> 00:34:21.610
because still body of work you've been doing forever.
Cared about it.

563
00:34:21.611 --> 00:34:24.370
I worked on it for two fucking years,
you know,

564
00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.760
and you had it yourself for reviews are awesome.
Came out great.

565
00:34:27.761 --> 00:34:30.850
I heard it's great.
I'm excited.
You know,
it's the best.

566
00:34:30.910 --> 00:34:32.860
I think the best one I've ever done.
I really do.

567
00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:35.170
I think the last one I think triggered was the best one.

568
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.900
And I think this one's better than that touch gill,
right?
Yeah.

569
00:34:37.901 --> 00:34:40.690
I mean that's how it should go.
Just keep working.
Keep,

570
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:41.510
<v 3>okay.</v>

571
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:45.980
<v 0>Keep trying to refine it and keep an,
you know,
raise my standards.</v>

572
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:49.040
I learned some stuff still after all these years doing stand up,

573
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:52.490
I'm still learning.
I learned some stuff in the editing process.
Really?
Yeah.

574
00:34:52.491 --> 00:34:54.080
Well I learned some stuff just watching.

575
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.770
I think I re I listened to recordings all the time.
Um,

576
00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.540
but I think I'm going to step my game up now.

577
00:34:59.541 --> 00:35:02.240
And after talking to Bert Kreischer yesterday,
Burt,

578
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.280
he records audio and he also records video and I think I'm going to start

579
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:09.320
recording video of all my shows to now

580
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.760
<v 2>it's top.
Oh yeah,</v>

581
00:35:10.761 --> 00:35:14.150
because when you're doing these giant theaters so there's not video cause like

582
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.530
how's that parlor?

583
00:35:15.531 --> 00:35:18.710
Wherever I go they usually have video capability so I get all the video.

584
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:20.090
That's nice.
I always get the video.

585
00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.760
<v 0>Well the ice house can do that for me.
You know,
I can,</v>

586
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.270
I could definitely get someone to do that for me at the store.

587
00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:30.460
But I just think it's critical to see the way you move as well as here.

588
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.120
Like you got to analyze all that shit and try to figure out what you got to be

589
00:35:34.121 --> 00:35:35.530
natural and in the moment.

590
00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:40.100
But you also got to analyze the particulars and find out like what,
like owl,

591
00:35:40.101 --> 00:35:44.370
I would watch like two or three different sets cause I feel in for shows and I

592
00:35:44.371 --> 00:35:47.220
was like why?
Like why did I do that in the second show?

593
00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:49.690
Like the way I did it there.
That's the way to do it.
Yeah.

594
00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:53.310
But I did it differently in this other show.
I think the shitty parts,

595
00:35:53.311 --> 00:35:55.050
watching yourself and listening to yourself,

596
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:59.660
it takes a real type of asshole to do that.
Right?
It's the word.

597
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.360
It tastes real type of asphalt.
A like it oh two and just like,
oh,
that was good.

598
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.550
Yeah.
You well that's pretty good.

599
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.010
Have you ever been over someone's house and they make you want,

600
00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.890
they make you watch something that they did too.
Oh,

601
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:17.640
quarterback Vinny Testaverde.
He's a first round draft pick.
He played forever.

602
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:22.790
We went to his house and he made me watch the recap of his last football season.

603
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.580
Two our NFL films recap of the Baltimore Ravens and it was a nightmare.

604
00:36:28.981 --> 00:36:32.670
I need you to sit there and recap.
It was so boring.

605
00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.140
Shut the fuck promise.
I want to put a fucking bullet through my mind,

606
00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.290
but how of the respect of any tests or Verdi and he'd beat my ass in basketball

607
00:36:40.291 --> 00:36:44.910
before that.
I stayed there and watched it.
Ah,
who does that though?

608
00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.410
I heard about a dude who,
um,

609
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.620
he had a party over his house and then when the people were over there,

610
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:57.210
he made them listen to him sing a song.
Is it Brian Cowen?
Nope.
Just kidding.

611
00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.780
Some other guy.
I know who you're talking about it cause I think I was there,

612
00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:06.810
played music and sang and was serious during the middle of the super ball.

613
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:07.620
Sir.

614
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:12.420
Put the Superbowl on pause and his band struck up a fucking song.

615
00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.700
I looked around and went,
is everyone a terrorist here?
What was happening?

616
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:21.600
Why is the game paused?
I'm from Denver,
Colorado.

617
00:37:21.601 --> 00:37:26.490
My put that Goddamn drum stick down.
I'm going to flip the flip the fuck.

618
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:30.360
That was the most Hollywood thing I've ever seen in my life.
I went,
well,

619
00:37:30.361 --> 00:37:34.380
I feel sick and I'm going to leave now I feel very sick and then the middle of

620
00:37:34.381 --> 00:37:39.090
the fucking game and my Broncos are playing too.
Oh Dude,
people are so strange.

621
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.210
I'm like,
what the fuck?

622
00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.560
That's the most Hollywood thing I've ever seen in my life where I felt sick.

623
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.870
Yeah,
I've seen many of those.

624
00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:53.871
I was over someone's house once and this guy ran outside to his car to get a

625
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.620
video to get us to watch a music video that he did was,

626
00:37:58.650 --> 00:38:01.170
which was one of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life.

627
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.780
People like gray and it was a music video and as a music video that look there

628
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:08.850
is made for about $3 Oh God.
It was just like what the fuck?

629
00:38:08.851 --> 00:38:11.730
And he's like singing all sincere in this music video and we're all sitting

630
00:38:11.731 --> 00:38:14.640
around like we have to watch what torture.

631
00:38:14.641 --> 00:38:19.200
It's just compressing my chest and a vice.
I'm like,
I can't breathe.

632
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.870
But you've never seen comics like played there hour special and they've had

633
00:38:21.871 --> 00:38:24.900
people over.
I haven't seen that yet,
but I'm sure it's happening.

634
00:38:24.901 --> 00:38:27.990
It's happening right now as we speak right now.
There's a like,
come on everybody,

635
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:30.690
sit down,
sit down.
It's time for my special,
come on everyone get around

636
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.860
fighting.
What did he laughing at?
Burke did that.

637
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.500
Her Chrysler did that.
No,
he did that with his family though.

638
00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:43.100
They had like a screening.
No,

639
00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:47.110
they have like a specifically was it friends and fit was his friends too.
Yeah.

640
00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.980
But he,
no,
no,
no,
that's,
I hear it's a different thing.

641
00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.990
Like he invited them to a screening of his special where that was the purpose.

642
00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:59.020
It wasn't like he threw it on in the middle of a party.

643
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:04.080
Everybody should watch my special enjoying the music and I got pizza here.

644
00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.330
Different.
Yeah,
it's different.
No,

645
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.270
it was a screening and his agents were there and his managers were there and

646
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:15.010
people that worked at is,
do you have a family come to your shooting?

647
00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:19.780
Your specialist?
No,
no,
no,

648
00:39:19.781 --> 00:39:23.680
no,
no.
Ma,
you know,
if someone from my family comes and watches me,

649
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.500
I mean they come to a show.
Yeah.

650
00:39:26.501 --> 00:39:29.530
But then I'd come into the shooting of it and then no one ever asked them to

651
00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.240
like if they want to.
But does your wife like to go or she's like,
she,

652
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:37.990
I have her come out like every six months or so.
See,

653
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.730
just to see like tell me,
tell me is it anything new?
Like what,
what's,

654
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.750
what's different because she's known you for so she would know.
It's like,

655
00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.420
yeah,
someone's,
here's the thing,
if someone sees you every weekend,

656
00:39:52.421 --> 00:39:55.720
and I have friends that take their girlfriends on the road with them and they

657
00:39:55.721 --> 00:40:00.721
get so bored with their act cause they're watching a guy perform every night,

658
00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.300
two nights in a row,
two shows in a night,
they fucking,

659
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:10.060
your act is nonsense to them.
Bottled Blah Blah,
blah.

660
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.910
You are my favorite people on planet Earth Mama come store all the time.

661
00:40:12.911 --> 00:40:13.300
I've seen,

662
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:16.060
you know you're set when you're ready for this a bunch of times and when I was

663
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:18.460
leaving someone's like,
can I watch John?
Mike Do.
I've seen it man.

664
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:21.820
It's not disrespect.
Fuck.
I've seen it though.

665
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.930
I don't even watch like seen it 10 times.
I don't even watch my favorites.

666
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.910
Even Joey,
I'll sometimes leave the room if he's on stage.
Yeah,
you don't,
you,

667
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:33.280
you also don't want to get bored with someone's act.

668
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.100
You can't watch them over and over and over and over and over again.

669
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:37.690
But that's what happens with girlfriends.

670
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.440
Girlfriends would go on the road with guys there watching two sets a night.

671
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:45.400
What a terrible idea.
Thursday,
Friday,
Saturday,

672
00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:46.900
Blah.

673
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.420
And then they just think you suck because they don't make them laugh anymore.

674
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.470
Hunched over it.
They're like,
really?
This is what you do.

675
00:40:53.471 --> 00:40:55.520
You tell the same story every night,

676
00:40:55.930 --> 00:41:00.310
shut up that you pretended to do story and then if you have a new opening act

677
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:04.240
like he's really funny.
Like he's funny.
What about me?
He's funny.

678
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:07.690
You know I've seen you too many times.
Like,
oh no.
Yeah,
my brother,

679
00:41:07.691 --> 00:41:10.740
he's thinking I was great.
He's on the road to me every time and the other night,

680
00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.590
here we go again cause I feel like I could do your ass mother fucker.
He seen it.

681
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.720
He probably didn't know it by heart.
We used to do that in Boston.

682
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:24.310
We had a thing called Joe Biden night at stitches and Joe Joe Biden,

683
00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.970
who was the former vice president.
People don't remember this,

684
00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:31.840
but in 1988 when he was running for president,

685
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:36.200
he got busted retelling some of Kennedy's old speeches.

686
00:41:37.390 --> 00:41:41.540
Come on,
man.
This is an 88.
Yeah,
it was a big scandal.

687
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.190
So we uh,

688
00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:46.190
and that kind of took them out of the running for being president for a long

689
00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:50.930
time,
although they're talking about it again for 20,
20.
But he,
um,

690
00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:55.730
so we would do Joe Biden night at the comedy store.
I would do your act.

691
00:41:56.210 --> 00:42:00.950
Awesome.
That's hilarious.
People probably loved it.
Oh,
they loved it.
It was,

692
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:05.350
you know,
like an off night.
It was like a Monday you doing Joey d is a fuck.
Yeah.

693
00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.880
Yeah.
Well that would be good because I can do an impression of Joel.

694
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.700
I know like a lot of it was just people just doing the material.
Christa,

695
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:15.080
Leah does Callan fucking great.
Yeah,
yeah,

696
00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.740
yeah.
Comedy is a weird thing.
You know,
you do it too.
I mean,

697
00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.310
that's one of the things about this special,
it's like I got too close to it.

698
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.090
You know,

699
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:26.150
like when you're editing things and you're practicing it and you're doing it

700
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:29.070
over and over again.
I know it's working.
I know I go to a cloud.
No,

701
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:33.350
it's going to work.
It's polished.
I practiced it.
I wrote it out,

702
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:38.270
I redid it.
I fucking edit it and change it,
twisted it,
and I know how to do it,

703
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.500
but I also don't want to hear it like I've not,
I've heard it too many times,

704
00:42:42.501 --> 00:42:44.450
so you get too close to it.

705
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:47.330
So then when people are going to see it for the very first time,
you're like,

706
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.870
I don't know.
I don't know.
I hope they like it.

707
00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:55.520
I just got to come too close to it.
Even after all these years.
Yes.
If you care,

708
00:42:55.521 --> 00:42:57.820
you get nervous and it isn't it.
It's you're,
it's,

709
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.710
you're so close to this body of work.
Like you said,
this is your baby.

710
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:03.380
You know what I'm saying?
If someone's like,
dude,
that sucked.

711
00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:04.880
You're like mother fucker.

712
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.820
There's definitely people that are going to think it sucks.

713
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:08.990
That's always going to happen.

714
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:13.310
But my thing is the majority of my fans who liked my comedy,

715
00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:17.630
I want them to like her.
And so for me it's like I was confident.

716
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.910
I knew I did everything I could do.
I knew,

717
00:43:19.911 --> 00:43:23.630
I know I'm a good comic and I know I've done everything I could do to make this

718
00:43:23.631 --> 00:43:27.080
my best one.
So I knew I was confident.

719
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:31.160
I knew it was a good special,
and I thought it was my best special.

720
00:43:31.161 --> 00:43:35.420
I'm very confident that it's my best special,
but it's still,

721
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.700
I'm too close to it,
so I don't know.
Anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.

722
00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:46.520
Well that's good transition this weekend.
This dude,
I'll tell you this,

723
00:43:46.521 --> 00:43:50.780
I'm not being a hater.
I'm not being,
uh,
some sort of Debbie Downer.

724
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:55.100
I don't think it breaks 2 million paper view bys.
You might be right.
I'm not,

725
00:43:55.101 --> 00:43:59.690
I'm not seeing it,
man.
Like when Connor fought Florida Floyd,
or when Connor,
uh,

726
00:43:59.691 --> 00:44:04.490
Nate Diaz to,
I couldn't go anywhere without under Starbucks unit.

727
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:09.380
Anywhere shoe store where car dealer.
Everyone would,
dude,
Connor Floyd,

728
00:44:09.381 --> 00:44:13.220
who you got man,
everybody in their mom.
Now,
very rare.

729
00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.140
Maybe I'll one of my shows someone to bring it up.

730
00:44:15.141 --> 00:44:18.290
But there's something that Connor didn't want to do for this fight and that's

731
00:44:18.291 --> 00:44:22.250
massive promotion.
So does that mean it's not as big?
Like,

732
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:26.390
who's that fallen is at con or the you have Scott.
He doesn't want to do it.
Well,

733
00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:29.660
the,
the UFC has a model,
right?
And it worked in the Josie Aldo fight.

734
00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.550
That model is you just promote the holy

735
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.720
<v 2>fuck out of a fight.
You travel the world,
you promote the shit out of it.</v>

736
00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.120
He screamed at each other at press conferences.

737
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.460
He do all that stuff for months and months and months.

738
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:45.060
And those things sell like crazy.
If it's Conor Mcgregor,
if it's Conor McGregor.

739
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:48.900
So who have they ever done it with besides Conor McGregor like that?

740
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.980
No one really sells like that.
They,
you know,
a little bit with Rhonda I guess,

741
00:44:52.981 --> 00:44:57.060
but she didn't have the same kind of chops as Connor.
So Connor's the only one.

742
00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.280
But you know,
I don't know.

743
00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:02.370
Maybe it's cause he had a layoff mates after the Floyd thing.
I think it does.

744
00:45:02.371 --> 00:45:06.810
Well,
I don't think it breaks,
uh,
uh,
converse.
Nate too.
Well,

745
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.310
I don't think your breaks 1.6 million.

746
00:45:08.311 --> 00:45:13.050
What I think happened was Connor made a hundred fucking million dollars and he

747
00:45:13.051 --> 00:45:16.740
was like,
yeah.
Um,
I'm just going to train.
You know,
I think,

748
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:20.700
I think there's that and that also goes,
I'm not,

749
00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:24.390
that took so much energy to do all that and everyone knows me as that guy.

750
00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.400
I have the toughest fight of my life coming up.

751
00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:30.720
I'm taking every precaution necessary not to overtrain Yep.

752
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:32.370
Not to use all my energy.
This,

753
00:45:32.371 --> 00:45:34.710
I'm in the fight of my life and I'm going to train like it.

754
00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:35.910
I'm shutting down everything.

755
00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:40.440
You can post the fucking me throwing the Dolly through the window 1000 times.

756
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.020
I'll do the press conference on Thursday.
Other than that,
man,

757
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.180
I have got to get ready for the fight of my life.

758
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:46.350
That's the way I'm looking at it.

759
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.140
I think you're right and I think this is the fight of his life.

760
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:51.690
I think stylistically it's a nightmare matchup.

761
00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.020
I think it's a nightmare match up for both of them.
I think anyone who goes,

762
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:57.600
oh Connor,
you know,
he can't wrestle.
They can't do this.

763
00:45:57.601 --> 00:46:00.840
He's just going to get taken down and pounded out your show off.

764
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:02.580
It's not even funny.
You don't know the game.

765
00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:07.590
He absolutely is capable of stuffing a take down or two in the early going.

766
00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:12.740
That's what's up because in the early going he's got that Stanger have a left

767
00:46:12.741 --> 00:46:14.310
hand and put his movement.

768
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.720
His footwork meant his footwork and Khabib is going to know that coming in.

769
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.100
He's going to be a little hesitant.

770
00:46:20.101 --> 00:46:23.220
He's not going to walk towards him like Edson Barboza did or he didn't.

771
00:46:23.221 --> 00:46:24.180
The Edson Barboza fight,

772
00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:29.200
you can't because Barboza is mostly kicks Barboza Tie stock kicks,

773
00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:34.320
lot of Thai style cakes and Khabib just put a tremendous amount of pressure on

774
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:35.430
him and then got ahold of him.

775
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.430
But Connor is going to crack them with Hans and his footwork is way better.
Yes,

776
00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:44.130
he's,
he's just way better at moving in and moving out.
I think when people go,

777
00:46:44.131 --> 00:46:48.090
it's either Connor starches him and gets the Kale or it could be just takes him

778
00:46:48.091 --> 00:46:51.930
down for five rounds and pounds him out.
I think a,
I think it's a,

779
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:54.180
it's a classic fight.
I think it's back and forth.

780
00:46:54.181 --> 00:46:57.480
I think if they fucking dog fight,
I think it's a fight of our lives,
man.

781
00:46:57.481 --> 00:46:59.790
I really do.
I think you're probably right.

782
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:03.870
I think you're getting a fucking great fight from two guys where there's more on

783
00:47:03.871 --> 00:47:06.060
the line than just win or lose.

784
00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:10.680
I think with Khabib and what he represents and talking to his team,
his team,

785
00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:14.250
Captain Josh Thompson,
he goes,
could be,
he was going to retire after this.
Really?

786
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.530
He wants to beat Conor and retire.
Really?

787
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:20.540
You want to retire like the Floyd Mayweather of MMA 27 and know,

788
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.900
beat the beat the UFC,
you know,
poster boy and he's walked off in the sunset.

789
00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.770
Unless they get,
I'm a super five just be or some,
he's done.
Really?

790
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.880
Wow.
That's shocking.
He's young.
Very shotgun.
He's,

791
00:47:33.881 --> 00:47:36.080
but think how long he's been doing this since he's,

792
00:47:36.081 --> 00:47:38.590
this whole has been fucking up and grizzly bears.
So he's like,
all right,

793
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.520
I'm over it.
This man,
and not to mention he lives with his family man.

794
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.360
He still lives his mom and dad,
his wife and his two kids.
Same House.
Wow.

795
00:47:46.450 --> 00:47:49.420
That's kind of monster you're dealing with.
And then for Connor,
I think it's,

796
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:52.770
it's a legacy fight where you know,
he,

797
00:47:52.771 --> 00:47:56.220
he's coming off the Floyd Mayweather kind of train.
There were,
you know,

798
00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.500
it was a success.
Either way,
you look at it,
he made $100 million.

799
00:47:59.501 --> 00:48:02.410
They compete against the best of all time and lasted more rounds.

800
00:48:02.411 --> 00:48:06.610
Anyone thought and trained for a complete boxing match,
it was striking to me.

801
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:10.090
Better go in this fight.
But for him,
it's not about the money.
You see him,

802
00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:14.230
the one interview he's done on Mac life,
they,
you can see it.
It's like,

803
00:48:14.231 --> 00:48:18.310
it's a vintage Connor.
We go,
Oh shit,
we got one here,
man.
This isn't,
you know,

804
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:19.900
the Floyd Mayweather is more of a show.

805
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:23.260
Like we didn't think he was going to win that.
This one.
He looked at it.
Oh Shit.

806
00:48:23.261 --> 00:48:24.190
That's vintage Connor.

807
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.190
This Mutha fuckers coming to fight and he might get taken down.
Yes.

808
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:28.570
I guarantee you he gets taken down.

809
00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.840
I'm a fuck around and get back up and he's going to get up and he's a keep

810
00:48:31.841 --> 00:48:34.600
getting up and used and keep coming and we've got a dock fight.
Man,

811
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.960
I think both guys can be fucked up after this fight.
And to me a classic,

812
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:43.470
he could be or as forward fucking just could be good starts in seven seconds.

813
00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:48.310
People be playing this on
this,
on a loop.

814
00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:50.560
Look Khabib's got to get through the fire.
You know,

815
00:48:50.561 --> 00:48:52.660
he's got to get through the fire in the early going.

816
00:48:52.690 --> 00:48:57.310
He's got to close that distance and he's got to do it with precision without

817
00:48:57.311 --> 00:48:59.080
letting his nerves affect him.
Right?

818
00:48:59.170 --> 00:49:02.080
I mean he's got all that shit talking con has done to him.

819
00:49:02.081 --> 00:49:04.060
He seen him rattled at the press conference.

820
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:07.480
He's rattled when he started talking about his dad.
He's rattled and I think,
um,

821
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:11.110
we've,
we've also never seen Khabib fight with high stakes.

822
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.710
Like when he fought Alec went to that was in high stakes,
Aliza,
amazing fighter.

823
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:18.630
But that's not the same as fighting Conor McGregor when he's fighting a Edson

824
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:21.010
Barboza that's not in high stakes when you're fighting Conor Mcgregor,

825
00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:24.850
Conor takes all the chips on that poker table,
puts it all in the mill goes,

826
00:49:24.851 --> 00:49:28.900
I'm all in.
You have to be all in.
I do.
Well under these circumstances,

827
00:49:28.901 --> 00:49:33.790
how do you respond?
Yeah.
So for,
we've never seen Khabib and everyone goes,
oh,

828
00:49:33.791 --> 00:49:35.530
his cardio is great,
it is great.

829
00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:40.860
But when the fucking Irish nation is rock in that fucking arena and there's all

830
00:49:42.401 --> 00:49:45.520
this pressure,
his heart rate's gonna go up and he'd see like,
God,

831
00:49:45.521 --> 00:49:49.190
I fucking hate this guy because he's never filed.
A guy who hates he hates con.

832
00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:53.050
Yeah.
How is he going to be over zealous and open himself up?
Yep.

833
00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.350
There has to be something there and we don't know exactly what all was an

834
00:49:56.351 --> 00:50:00.700
assassin until that five complete it get the best of all time.
Yeah.
Still is.

835
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:01.390
But that,

836
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:06.390
that fight exposed how good Connor psychological game is because months and

837
00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:09.100
months of being on tour with Conor,

838
00:50:09.101 --> 00:50:12.160
those press conferences kind of stealing his belt and screaming at them and

839
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:16.090
getting in his face and then starches him with one punch.
Oh,
amazing.

840
00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:17.320
But the what the,

841
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:21.820
what else is interesting is remember Connors and amazing counterpuncher well to

842
00:50:21.821 --> 00:50:25.290
be an amazing counter puncher and he needed to guide a punch at you can be,

843
00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:27.130
he's not going to punch at them,
right?

844
00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.520
Unless it becomes an ego thing like you did with a owl or Edson Barboza was just

845
00:50:31.521 --> 00:50:34.520
walked them down.
There's no respect.
He might throw some punches.

846
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:37.640
So it's me answering for Connor to find those angles when a guy's not playing

847
00:50:37.641 --> 00:50:39.290
the game.
It's also,
it could be,

848
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:43.760
was that a history of struggling to make weight that he cannot struggle to make

849
00:50:43.761 --> 00:50:45.530
weight for this fine.
He's gotta be on point.

850
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:49.370
He came in that press conference at one 74 they said this motherfucker started

851
00:50:49.371 --> 00:50:53.300
camp at one 80 something like he's,
he's never been more serious where a fight,

852
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.580
which for people listening,

853
00:50:55.581 --> 00:51:00.140
if you're saying like what buddy fights at one 55 he used to weigh 202 Hondo.

854
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:03.140
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then get down to one 55 and it was not good.

855
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.290
I mean the Michael Johnson fight,
he struggled.

856
00:51:06.291 --> 00:51:09.260
He had like some real shutdown issues.
And then the Tony Ferguson fight,

857
00:51:09.261 --> 00:51:10.490
they pulled him out of the fight.

858
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:14.710
He can't have any of that nonsense this weekend.
Oh No.
I don't think the,

859
00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.020
the nonsense.
The only thing where like Jamie told me is going to the fight.

860
00:51:18.021 --> 00:51:20.510
I would never go to this fight.
I think there's what?

861
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.870
I would not go this fight for this reason.
I'm a complete pussy.

862
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.310
I think something's going to happen.

863
00:51:25.311 --> 00:51:27.410
The crowd between the Russians and the Irish,

864
00:51:27.411 --> 00:51:31.580
I think that just the animosity between the two.
They hate each other so bad.

865
00:51:31.581 --> 00:51:35.210
If this fight,
it happens for Conor.
You're going to have upset Russians,

866
00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:39.210
but happens for Khabib.
Me,
I've upset fucking Irish.
I think it's good.

867
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.870
It's gotten bigger than just a UFC fight.
Really?
I do,
man.

868
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.260
You don't so hostile.

869
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:48.800
You think you wouldn't go to this fight because of the potential the violence

870
00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:52.160
breaks out.
Correct.
I also don't like going to UFC fights.

871
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.680
I still don't like you're going to UFC fights.
Why don't you like it?

872
00:51:54.681 --> 00:51:57.830
Because he used to fight.
It's just stressful for me.
I just,
yeah,

873
00:51:57.860 --> 00:51:58.700
just super stressful.

874
00:51:58.701 --> 00:52:01.160
If you feel like you're going to fight again when your dad get the nerves.

875
00:52:01.161 --> 00:52:04.310
And I'm just like,
oh,
I go complete opposite of that now.

876
00:52:04.311 --> 00:52:07.670
I try to get more relaxed,
you know,
when I'm doing standup,
I go,

877
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.390
I don't want to be in that scared mode anymore.
Yeah.
That's interesting.

878
00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:16.010
My heart rate under sweating the whole time,
I'm just like around like sweating.

879
00:52:16.011 --> 00:52:20.840
I looked like,
shit,
pull up that card.
Let me see the rest of the car,
dude.

880
00:52:20.841 --> 00:52:24.950
If you're Tony Ferguson,
it's like,
oh yeah,
and Tony's fighting.
Right?
It's,
I know.

881
00:52:24.951 --> 00:52:28.730
And he's funny pedis.
It's not an easy fight for comeback fight for total.
I mean,

882
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:33.110
I'm just amazed that he's able to fight again so quickly after knee surgery.

883
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.800
You don't,
what's interesting to me is I,
I asked Josh Thompson,

884
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:39.530
who knows could be you and I'll see you can talk to DC about it,
but they,
I go,

885
00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:43.790
dude,
Tony's back.
Like if could be where to win,
huge fight Tony,
right.
And goes,

886
00:52:43.791 --> 00:52:46.400
no interest.
Th that's fight does nothing to him mentally.

887
00:52:46.401 --> 00:52:49.520
He just doesn't care about it.
Could be just doesn't care.
Yeah.
He's like,

888
00:52:49.521 --> 00:52:53.450
not with Tony.
So he really just wants to fight Conor and then get out.
Get Out.

889
00:52:53.451 --> 00:52:58.040
One step once DSP from,
from this,
from Josh Thompson's mouth from could be,

890
00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:02.720
he wants to beat the UFC poster boy,
Dana's poster boy and walk the fuck out.

891
00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.030
Unless they give him a super fight.

892
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:08.750
Who the fuck has ever been 26 and o as a champion.

893
00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:14.300
I think that's the only one.
Yeah.
But 26 and,
oh,
for sure.
He's fucking,
who else?

894
00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:16.670
Like champion undefeated.

895
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:21.671
Champion [inaudible] was on John Jones Fight Matt Hamill before he won the

896
00:53:21.741 --> 00:53:24.950
title.
He thought met him on the ultimate fighter.
Roy Nelson bread.
No,

897
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.153
it wasn't the

898
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:29.870
<v 0>ultimate fighter.
That was ultimate fighter finale because I fought Roy Nelson.</v>

899
00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:32.890
Jon Jones.
Right.
Not on the,
not on the ultimate photo.

900
00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:36.570
You don't when they do the financial.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

901
00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:39.390
that's a bullshit laws though.
Oh my God.

902
00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:44.220
You got to loss from whooping a dude's ass so bad.
You know what?
Um,

903
00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.740
as far as unfair champions who,

904
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:53.490
I don't think there's one Hennen brow.
Oh,
he won,

905
00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:56.790
but he lost his first fight.
Yeah.
Cannonborough losses the first time.

906
00:53:57.410 --> 00:54:00.480
I know he was like,
he had like 30 wins in a row or some shit,

907
00:54:00.481 --> 00:54:02.220
but had a weird loss back in Brazil.
Yeah,

908
00:54:02.221 --> 00:54:04.530
he lost his first MMA fight rather Rhonda.

909
00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:06.340
<v 4>Okay.</v>

910
00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:09.460
<v 0>Yeah.
Ron.
Rhonda was undefeated.
Undefeated.
Yup.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

911
00:54:09.461 --> 00:54:13.420
Rhonda is only two losses where the two title fights between Holly and Amanda.

912
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:16.480
Let's see,
what do you got there,
Jamie?
What are you pulling up?

913
00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:19.660
List of undefeated MMA champions.

914
00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:24.630
Ben Asca and hanging around Ben aspirins for sure.
One of them put,

915
00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.480
Ben asks her to me and I've had him on the podcast.
I've said this,
the guy,

916
00:54:28.570 --> 00:54:31.900
he's my all Brian Arteaga but Brian or take isn't really a champion.

917
00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:35.380
Well these aren't champions.
Are they?
These just you undefeated MMA fighters.

918
00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:39.300
Yeah.
Sorry.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
These are champions.
Uh,

919
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.910
Ben's the one guy who I'd love to see coming out of retirement and fight could

920
00:54:42.911 --> 00:54:44.140
be,
he's the one guy.

921
00:54:44.141 --> 00:54:47.380
That's my biggest disappointment that that guy never fought in the UFC.

922
00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:50.840
It's a fucking shame.
And,
but the thing is like,
Khabib wouldn't,
my,

923
00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:53.720
nobody knows who he is outside of the hardcore guys.
Now why would you,

924
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:58.690
why would you fight them and maybe lose,
maybe get out wrestled.
Here's the only,

925
00:54:58.750 --> 00:55:03.070
if you're going to say something about could be bs 27 Oh,
he really,

926
00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:06.310
when you look at the body of work from Connor compared to Khabib assignment

927
00:55:06.311 --> 00:55:09.500
close the,
the winds that Connor has are remarkable.
Yes.

928
00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:13.560
You like the Max Holloway,
Chad Mendez,
Josie Aldo,
what he did to Eddie Alvarez.

929
00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.430
I mean,
ridiculous,
ridiculous,
ridiculous.
Yeah.
Nate Diaz.
When Nate Diaz loss,

930
00:55:18.450 --> 00:55:19.360
like you just look at the,

931
00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:24.020
the caliber of opponents that he's faced from a very young age.
It's a nightmare.

932
00:55:24.021 --> 00:55:26.380
And they look at Khabib,
he's 27 no,

933
00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.320
his biggest ones probably Barboza does when he was a little weathered,
but yeah,

934
00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:35.590
no,
but Barboza and the as a perfect stylistic matchup for him.

935
00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:40.750
So yeah,
we,
we,
we don't know with Qb,
we know he's damn good,
but how good.

936
00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:45.460
He's had one weird moment in his entire career.
The skin.
Michael Johnson,

937
00:55:45.461 --> 00:55:46.810
when Michael Johnson cracked him,

938
00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:51.280
wobbled him for a second and then took them down and smashed up Gleason,
uh,

939
00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:55.310
t bow to bow fight.
Got a little dicey to did it.
Yeah.
Paul,

940
00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:59.200
I don't remember that fight at all.
Um,
but,
but with,
with Michael Johnson,

941
00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:04.270
it's funny to me because Michael Jansen landed that big overhand MPP.
People go,

942
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.870
oh,
could be has a weak chin.
I'm like,
well,
well,
he's never been dropped.

943
00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.990
He's never been,
he's never been signed.

944
00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:14.710
The Johnson starched Dustin Poirier with one punch.
Don't forget about that.

945
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:19.300
Michael Johnson can fucking punch.
He's explosive is shit.
Yeah.
I mean he caught,

946
00:56:19.301 --> 00:56:22.390
could be and could be.
Got What?
Rock for a second.

947
00:56:22.391 --> 00:56:24.160
And then whether storm took him down,

948
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.700
<v 2>smashed him.
It was a total dominant performance.
Yeah.</v>

949
00:56:27.701 --> 00:56:30.760
If you look at his performance like you look at is rather his resume,

950
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:35.350
Pat Healey was a tough fighter that,
that,
that showed,

951
00:56:35.351 --> 00:56:38.050
able to heal.
He smashed able.
True Healer.
Remember Abel,

952
00:56:38.051 --> 00:56:41.550
he took down more times than anyone inside that octagon 21 thing.

953
00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:46.770
And you thought college wrestler and a strong guy to able strong as shit.

954
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.250
And that's Gleason.
Uhh,
t bow one is that 2012 that's [inaudible].

955
00:56:52.090 --> 00:56:53.680
That's that juicy.
Yeah.

956
00:56:53.681 --> 00:56:58.150
The real big fight was the Barboza fight and then ally Quinta was,
I mean as,

957
00:56:58.151 --> 00:57:00.850
as as last minute as last minute gets.

958
00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:04.330
And he still went five whole rounds with [inaudible],

959
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:07.120
which was interesting for a lot of people.

960
00:57:07.121 --> 00:57:11.290
Like I talked to Eddie Alvarez after that fight and he was like very
interesting.

961
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:13.540
Very interesting.
Yeah.
I was like,

962
00:57:13.541 --> 00:57:16.420
this is why you saw a lot of things in that fight,
honey.
He's like,
yeah,

963
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:18.640
he's like a,
you know,
once the,

964
00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:21.850
once the fight got into the later rounds and he's still standing up with guys,

965
00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.650
he let go.
Whoa.
All right.

966
00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.210
It's so interesting to me because when you talked to anyone from AK,

967
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:28.510
obviously they're super pro could be,
but they're like,
dude,

968
00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:30.880
this isn't even a fight like this.
What do you,

969
00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:32.650
this is one of Khabib's easier fights.

970
00:57:32.651 --> 00:57:35.830
He's definitely had way tougher match ups and like,
you're crazy man.

971
00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.830
They're like,
you should see,
could be go against Ed Ruth,

972
00:57:38.831 --> 00:57:43.570
who's an Olympic in Penn state wrestling.
He fucks him up.
He takes him down.
Like,

973
00:57:43.571 --> 00:57:47.830
what?
But that's,
you know,
that's,
that's that wrestling,
you know,

974
00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:51.550
that dance,
that rhythm.
Connor's not on that rhythm.
No.

975
00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:52.750
You're talking about a different animal.

976
00:57:53.020 --> 00:57:57.070
You talking about a guy who is one of the best fencers in the game,

977
00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:02.250
meaning can like jump in with one shot and put you out and he can do it moving

978
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:07.570
back.
He could do it moving forward.
He can time you and he'll,

979
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.860
he'll be very common there.
You will get the very best.
Conor McGregor,

980
00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.750
he's also no slouch on the ground.

981
00:58:13.751 --> 00:58:16.840
People think he's just gonna get taken down and like get crucifix right away.

982
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:20.800
You're out your goddamn mind trains with Dylan.
Dan as he,
he's brought in these,

983
00:58:20.970 --> 00:58:25.150
uh,
Dagestani wrestlers.
Like he's training with the elite of the elite.
He's,
he's,

984
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:27.450
you know,
it could be just going to do,
yeah,

985
00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.950
it's way easier to train for Khabib than it is Connor.

986
00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:34.510
The dark horse fight on the card is Derrick Lewis and Volkov.
It's a great fight.

987
00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:37.600
Zander Volkov might be the best heavyweight on the planet.

988
00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:40.030
What's he want his last six fight winning streak.

989
00:58:40.031 --> 00:58:42.130
He's a guy who was flying under the radar.

990
00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:46.210
It's giant to his last fight and knocked out for doing people forget it seemed

991
00:58:46.211 --> 00:58:50.200
like six eight Isam.
Six eight yeah.
Six eight giant tall,

992
00:58:50.201 --> 00:58:55.201
long dude who did real well in Beltour world champion belt and he has massive

993
00:58:55.751 --> 00:59:00.000
experience and you see him in that fight with for doom.
He fucked her doom.

994
00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:03.040
Oh no man,
he's the problem.
Interesting for doom.

995
00:59:03.041 --> 00:59:07.270
Just released a statement saying that you saw to asked him to snitch.

996
00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:09.730
I know what's going on with the snitch and stuff.
I don't know.

997
00:59:09.731 --> 00:59:12.910
They offered him a Alene more lenient sentence.

998
00:59:12.911 --> 00:59:16.390
If he was willing to snitch and he goes,
fuck you.

999
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:22.070
And John that too.
And I guess John was like,
cool.
I don't know.
I don't either,

1000
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.680
but that's what they're saying.
I don't need a John snitched.

1001
00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:28.130
Did you hear Johnston?
That's,
that's,
that's what the statement says.

1002
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.920
But John's manager says that he didn't stay.
What statement from who?

1003
00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:32.550
The statements from him.

1004
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:37.910
His manager give skeptical hippo phase dude.
But no,

1005
00:59:37.911 --> 00:59:40.160
I'm not saying John.
Dude,
let's be very clear.

1006
00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:44.840
All I'm saying is he came out that statement and then Malka goes,

1007
00:59:44.841 --> 00:59:47.830
he didn't snitch and then everybody's like,
wait,
what the Wicki?

1008
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:49.190
Novitsky was like,
no.

1009
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:53.060
You said you're going give us some info to help us out down the road with other

1010
00:59:53.061 --> 00:59:56.760
people.
So you know I don't what?
Yeah,

1011
00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.350
you saw that to release an official statement went,
hold on,
wait a minute.

1012
01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.200
Because Malik came out and was like,
no,
we never agreed.
So we're going to snitch.

1013
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.250
And then you saw it as like,
well,
well no,
remember really contracts you sign.

1014
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.800
Here's this section of the contract.

1015
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:14.720
He said they would help them out in the future with other people.
I mean,

1016
01:00:14.721 --> 01:00:19.160
but bring it up.
Jamie.
John John's world champion walking around wearing a wire.

1017
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:22.250
Hey guys.
Hey,
can you just say working?
God,
everyone else?

1018
01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.330
Anyone else just exhausted today.
Cancer.
Just so you got your secret.

1019
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:30.980
God,
anything bro,
why are you a full hoodie and sweatsuit in the solid?

1020
01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.580
I don't,
you know,
I'm going to go out on a limb here.

1021
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.650
I don't think that Jon cheated.
I don't need a,
you don't think he cheated?
No.

1022
01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:43.040
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's very murky water.
I might be wrong.

1023
01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.310
I don't think he cheated.
I think he took something that was tainted.

1024
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:49.910
I think that's why they're only giving them a year off and I think,
look,

1025
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:51.730
I'd set it on the podcast and he's skeptical.

1026
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:53.960
Hipaa eyes about how it's shortened sentence.

1027
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:57.170
It's ready to go right around New York.
No.
Right around this ESPN deal.

1028
01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.370
Monkey says there was none,

1029
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:04.320
but I keep saying that and everybody keeps running with it.

1030
01:01:04.321 --> 01:01:07.730
Substantial assistance doesn't necessarily mean it has to be on somebody else.

1031
01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:11.880
It could have been on himself.
What so go up to the part that you've sought us,

1032
01:01:11.881 --> 01:01:15.860
says that's what you sought a released.
That statement reached out and said,

1033
01:01:15.861 --> 01:01:17.060
there are two avenues above,

1034
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:19.520
above antidote policy allow for reduction of sanctions.

1035
01:01:19.521 --> 01:01:23.240
One individual can get a sanctioned reduction if he or she provides information

1036
01:01:23.241 --> 01:01:27.440
that results in Usada or another antidoping agency bringing forward an

1037
01:01:27.441 --> 01:01:32.441
anti-doping policy violation against other athletes or support personnel and or

1038
01:01:34.281 --> 01:01:38.270
two or reduction can be given if the information results in a criminal or

1039
01:01:38.271 --> 01:01:39.620
disciplinary body,

1040
01:01:39.621 --> 01:01:44.570
bringing forward a criminal offense against individuals.
Importantly,

1041
01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:49.720
if the athlete or support personnel fails to continue to cooperate and provide

1042
01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:54.680
credible substantial assistance,
you saw we'll reinstate the original sanction,

1043
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:58.790
that snitching where I come from,
but I don't know.

1044
01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:02.900
Now I don't think John snitched on anyone to get a shorter sentence.

1045
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.710
We'll find out if Jackson guys are popping left and right all of a sudden.

1046
01:02:06.711 --> 01:02:11.210
But I don't think John did that.
I think that's just in there.
Maybe,
maybe or,

1047
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:13.780
or if,
I don't know.
We do not know.

1048
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:16.520
And I like to give John Jones the benefit of the doubt.
And I will say this,

1049
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:21.240
if I'm like UFC fighter,
I am hiring mouthy to be my goddamn manager.

1050
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:25.710
Cause what he's done with John,
what he did with,
um,
frickin all his guys.

1051
01:02:25.711 --> 01:02:29.520
You what he did with,
uh,
your boy Yoel Romero,
he goes to bat for them.

1052
01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:32.070
No one else is fucking with the golden snitch like Malika does.

1053
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.110
And everyone else kind of just goes,
ah,
fuck.
We got busted man,
not Maliki,
man.

1054
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:42.090
That dude's going to the end of the earth.
The fight for your freedom.
Yeah,
he,
he,

1055
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:45.150
and it seems like know him that well,
I don't know him as a person,
you know,

1056
01:02:45.151 --> 01:02:47.760
managers or managers,
but I'm saying if I'm the UFC,

1057
01:02:47.761 --> 01:02:50.460
because they can't negotiate your sponsorship,
it's Reebok.

1058
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:53.410
So what can they really do your contract and now you've got to deal with you

1059
01:02:53.411 --> 01:02:54.720
Sato who is a huge deal.

1060
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:58.320
Mackey's this fucking dog right now that you want in your back pocket.

1061
01:02:58.321 --> 01:03:00.330
And it's interesting that you saw that as just released.

1062
01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:03.460
They released a statement that they're changing their policies.

1063
01:03:03.461 --> 01:03:05.760
So say if you piss hot,
they don't.

1064
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:09.750
And what's really interesting is Sean O'malley and right afterwards said,
Yo,

1065
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:14.220
I pissed hot.
He said,
they don't want to announce people pissed how?
He goes,

1066
01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:16.760
I pissed hot.
And he goes,
let me tell you something.
Um,

1067
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:21.030
they're going to check my supplements and,
uh,
we,
we think we've got it nailed.

1068
01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.070
We think we know what it is,
but in the meantime,

1069
01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:25.080
this is why I was removed from his fight this weekend.

1070
01:03:25.081 --> 01:03:27.450
So they're not going to announce it.
Just going to pull you from the card.

1071
01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.720
They're just going to pull you from the card.
That ain't right.

1072
01:03:29.721 --> 01:03:31.320
And they don't announce it.
That didn't right.

1073
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.920
And then they go through the entire steps.

1074
01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:39.000
And then if you're exonerated,
you were never accused in the first place.
See,

1075
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.950
the problem is,
is with Sean O'malley,
with whoever you are,
Travis Browne,

1076
01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:47.160
whoever name any fighter you want,
if you've ever been,

1077
01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.900
even if it's even been hinted,
if you've ever had an issue,
um,

1078
01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:56.610
and you get that label,
nothing like people just go,
he's on steroids.

1079
01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.200
They don't show big announcement going,
sorry,
we didn't find anything my bat.
Hey,

1080
01:04:01.201 --> 01:04:05.610
Josh Barnett.
So I've been out for 22 months,
my bat.
Right?
What the fuck man?

1081
01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.120
Right.
Gimme some sort of compensation.
That's true.
Also you.

1082
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:13.680
So it took you how long to figure this out.
I can't work during that time period.

1083
01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:18.420
And because of you,
I can't work and you made the mistake.

1084
01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:22.800
How are we going to make this?
Right?
Oh I bet you can go fight now.
That's insane.

1085
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:26.470
Especially for Josh.
She's like 37 he's not young.
Or how about friends?

1086
01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:30.490
Zach's the older than 37 Josh might be 40 yeah,
he's not.
He's long in the tooth.

1087
01:04:30.491 --> 01:04:32.640
He's been doing it for a hot minute.
Yeah,
I mean he was.

1088
01:04:32.641 --> 01:04:34.320
But think if you're John Jones though,
dude,

1089
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:37.290
let's say he lets say you're right and he didn't do anything.

1090
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:41.730
Nothing on purpose and it was some bullshit supplement and he's been dragged

1091
01:04:41.731 --> 01:04:44.430
through the mud up.
Rightfully so after hitting a woman pregnant,
all that.

1092
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:47.520
But with this,
that's a different thing.
That's a different thing with this,

1093
01:04:47.521 --> 01:04:51.930
you're like,
what the fuck man,
I could've fought Brock Lesnar.
I come a double,

1094
01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:55.740
I can live in dcs life but because of this I've been out,
I've been,

1095
01:04:55.741 --> 01:05:00.030
my name has been tarnished forever.
Yeah,
but there was something in his urine.

1096
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:05.040
There was a substance and that substance is a performance enhancing substance.

1097
01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:07.410
The real question is did it come?

1098
01:05:07.411 --> 01:05:10.170
Like there's a lot of people that got it from supplements.

1099
01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.840
I mean this is happening all throughout sports,

1100
01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:14.250
but then there's people that say no,

1101
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:18.040
they're saying that it happened from supplements,
but really that's just an

1102
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.340
<v 0>excuse for p for them getting pop.
That's what most people,
yeah,</v>

1103
01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:22.960
the majority side with that.

1104
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:26.920
The problem in John's situation is that he tested negative and then he tested

1105
01:05:26.921 --> 01:05:30.220
positive and he tested negative in a very short period of time,

1106
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:34.030
which means that the amount that was in his system is a trace amount,

1107
01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:38.800
which is not anything that you could take that would impart performance

1108
01:05:38.801 --> 01:05:39.634
enhancing benefits.

1109
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:43.940
They said it like having a drop of steroids and a huge vat of water.
Right.

1110
01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:48.700
It's like a benefit.
It's not about some people and not me,
man,
I'm,
I'm with you.

1111
01:05:48.701 --> 01:05:51.490
I maybe did take something that he wasn't supposed to,

1112
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:54.910
but I don't think it helped his performance.
But um,
some people say,

1113
01:05:54.911 --> 01:05:57.850
oh well that he was micro dosing so it didn't give out of a system in time.

1114
01:05:57.851 --> 01:05:59.290
That's why such small trace amounts,

1115
01:05:59.470 --> 01:06:03.180
but at the time if there would a test and been a higher potency maybe.

1116
01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.760
I don't think you can microdosed this shit though.
I have no idea Joe.

1117
01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:09.550
I don't know but,
but listen,
they said he didn't do it.

1118
01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:13.240
Here's the shitty thing though.
Now dcs upset cause they're like k DC.

1119
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:16.090
We're going to strip you of one of your belts and John's going to fight for it,

1120
01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.950
but they haven't worked that out yet.

1121
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:21.820
Maybe you want to try the Gustafson Jon Jones situation is still hasn't been

1122
01:06:21.821 --> 01:06:24.580
resolved yet.
Dang.
Dang.
We're gonna find out this weekend.

1123
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:26.590
Do you think we see how the card,
yeah,

1124
01:06:26.591 --> 01:06:29.620
I think this weekend they'll have to announce they have to announce soft fucking

1125
01:06:29.621 --> 01:06:34.070
month away man.
I mean what else do you do that knee that you know,

1126
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.130
this is a great card.
I'll see the main minutes.
Ridiculous.

1127
01:06:36.131 --> 01:06:39.260
But that mask where garnering cards a better fight.
Better,
better overall fight.

1128
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.130
No,
I think it is to,
this is look the,

1129
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:47.131
the big fights on this card or Norma Madoff and a Ferguson versus a pedes nurse

1130
01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:50.440
number coming off Parsons.
Connor's a fight for the ages.
I mean,

1131
01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:54.010
that's absolutely one of the biggest fights in the history of the sport.

1132
01:06:54.370 --> 01:06:55.960
That's a giant fucking fight.

1133
01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:00.100
I mean undefeated champion who just smashes in malls,

1134
01:07:00.101 --> 01:07:03.430
people against one of the most enigmatic,

1135
01:07:03.431 --> 01:07:08.431
charismatic fucking superstars a sports ever known and he's coming off of a long

1136
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:14.970
two year absence from MMA where he fought the biggest boxer on the planet earth,

1137
01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.970
arguably the best boxer ever,

1138
01:07:19.330 --> 01:07:24.270
and went 10 rounds with them and then he's going from that to finding neuropsych

1139
01:07:24.271 --> 01:07:28.600
and Madoff again for the title is a giant fight.

1140
01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:32.650
Huge.
Right.
The biggest fight in UFC history for sure,

1141
01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.580
Connor is changed the sport.
I mean,
he really has forever.

1142
01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.900
He's a different thing.
He's different than all,
all the rest of the fighters.

1143
01:07:40.901 --> 01:07:45.120
He's just different.
He's so much more of a superstar.
Yeah.

1144
01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:47.200
He's more literally like it.
He's more of a,

1145
01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:52.150
he's the biggest celebrity with the best talents they've ever had and not doing

1146
01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:55.810
other things too.
He's like,
Fuck your movie.
So He's,
he's at some crazy,

1147
01:07:55.811 --> 01:07:56.530
I know firsthand.

1148
01:07:56.530 --> 01:07:59.860
He said some crazy offers from Ricky didn't take it that and were like,
no,

1149
01:07:59.861 --> 01:08:02.290
he didn't want to do it.
He says he wants to be loyal to the game.

1150
01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.960
He said there's plenty of time for that bullshit when I'm done fighting.

1151
01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:07.120
Brilliant.
Yeah,
I mean that's the way to do it.
I mean,

1152
01:08:07.121 --> 01:08:10.390
I think that is one of the things that did Rhonda in said she was doing

1153
01:08:10.391 --> 01:08:13.390
everything.
I mean they had her doing movies,
they had her doing TV,

1154
01:08:13.391 --> 01:08:16.010
shad dinner and but also is the skillset with Connor

1155
01:08:16.010 --> 01:08:18.800
<v 2>to little different,
he has this skill set.
Yes,
yes,
yes.</v>

1156
01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.860
It's a more comprehensive camp too.

1157
01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:25.730
I mean there was a Achilles heel with Rhonda was the camp.

1158
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:29.480
I mean you look,
if you're fighting someone like Amanda Nunez,

1159
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:34.000
you better be fully prepared.
It's just different to,
you know,
with,
with,

1160
01:08:34.001 --> 01:08:38.290
with the female division II,
it's still growing.
So you know,
she,
she,

1161
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:41.660
what she was in her time period was one of the best of all time is the pioneer

1162
01:08:41.661 --> 01:08:43.610
of the sport.
But you know,
there's so,

1163
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:47.060
so much in their infancy of starting with mixed martial arts,

1164
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:48.650
they're adapting fast.

1165
01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.910
So Rhonda didn't get better when everyone else got a lot better that they caught

1166
01:08:52.911 --> 01:08:55.880
up to her.
She didn't have the skill sets.
And I think there was,

1167
01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.670
I think you're right.
I think it hurt her game didn't advance.

1168
01:08:58.671 --> 01:09:00.940
But I think there's also,
I mean just,

1169
01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:06.230
but she was so fucking good compared to them in the beginning.

1170
01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:10.610
She was just so good.
And then she was doing everything she was doing.

1171
01:09:10.611 --> 01:09:12.540
TV shows,
movies,

1172
01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.710
it's just the wrong people around from her management and her agent Brad,

1173
01:09:15.711 --> 01:09:18.350
like the whole thing was a nightmare.
The whole thing's a nightmare.

1174
01:09:18.410 --> 01:09:20.060
So she's doing all that stuff.

1175
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:23.720
Totally worked out all these distractions and worked out financially up to a

1176
01:09:23.721 --> 01:09:28.250
point.
Well when I say to me were big ones,
big ones.

1177
01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:30.890
I mean it worked out in the sense where,
you know,
she don't stop now.

1178
01:09:30.891 --> 01:09:33.590
She looks happy.
She's in the WWE.
She's a huge star over there.

1179
01:09:33.591 --> 01:09:35.120
She's actually really good at it.

1180
01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:37.670
She's killing it over there for sure in the WWE.

1181
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:40.490
Apparently she's like a natural at it.
Right.

1182
01:09:40.491 --> 01:09:42.900
So she's the champ over there and not getting him the face.

1183
01:09:42.901 --> 01:09:47.160
So just that brain down.
It's,
yeah.
Well,
well he's still get brain damage.
Yeah.

1184
01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.390
So I guess it kind of worked out.
Yeah.
But I mean when you,

1185
01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:53.190
when you're talking about Khabib and Connor,
you're talking about this too,

1186
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:57.460
most skillful lightweights of all time about one guy is,
uh,

1187
01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.170
the best grappler we've ever seen in the UFC and could beam.

1188
01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.890
The other is the best striker we've ever seen in the UFC.
One of them for sure.

1189
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:07.370
I think he's the best,
far as timing as far as putting all together his movement.

1190
01:10:07.371 --> 01:10:09.050
We've never seen anything like it.
Not even,

1191
01:10:09.290 --> 01:10:12.890
I think what he does is complete different with Wonderboy does,
oh,
we seen a one.

1192
01:10:12.891 --> 01:10:15.740
I can go watch that.
I'm not taking any credit away from one to,

1193
01:10:15.741 --> 01:10:19.760
but I'm saying from Wonderboy coming over with his kickboxing background into

1194
01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:22.400
UFC that we've seen some of that wonderful.

1195
01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:26.240
It's just the best thing is you've never seen Conor fight a guy like Wonderboy,

1196
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:30.230
whereas you've seen Wonderboy fight Darren till you've seen Wonderboy fight

1197
01:10:30.231 --> 01:10:34.460
someone who's that kind of a striker and never seen Conor fight someone who is

1198
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:38.480
as dangerous standing up as he is.
Jose Aldo.
Yeah,

1199
01:10:38.481 --> 01:10:42.320
but it was a different weight class really.
He was at the new somebody's finger,

1200
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:48.600
but at the time,
right.
Like remember Joseph autos,
they fucking assassin.
Yeah.

1201
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:52.330
We like what he did to Joe's eight for whatever reason,
puts this shade over.

1202
01:10:52.350 --> 01:10:57.230
Josie.
Josie was so good,
man.
It's true.
As a killer.
Striking was amazing.

1203
01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:01.490
Everyone was hanging off his Brazilian nuts and they get starts in 13 seconds

1204
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:03.740
where like,
he's,
all right.
Well then the question is like,

1205
01:11:03.810 --> 01:11:07.100
did Connor catch him when he had already taken in a lot of damage?

1206
01:11:07.101 --> 01:11:09.200
Like after the second Chad Mendez fight?

1207
01:11:09.201 --> 01:11:13.890
People started to question because then second fight,
you know,
that was great.

1208
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:19.740
Yeah,
no,
it's good point.
But then,
and then he fights a young Max Holloway,

1209
01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:22.260
you know they're both young.
That's not an easy fight.

1210
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:26.070
Beats Max Holloway and has a torn fucking ACL or MCL in his knee.

1211
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.320
Does that he fights Dustin poray you like,

1212
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:31.760
you look at the guy like Max Holloway champion portray.

1213
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:35.730
He's fighting fucking Nate Diaz now.
He could easily be the one 55 champion.

1214
01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.720
Eddie Alvarez champion.
Chad Mendez champion.
What do you know about,

1215
01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:42.930
but you know Chad is super last minute notice.
No Cardio.

1216
01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:45.810
Didn't have a camp but I'll just a window when brother.
Yeah,
that's true.

1217
01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.840
That's true.
But there's a caveat next door.
Sure.
But still,

1218
01:11:49.290 --> 01:11:52.410
what are you hearing about Max Holloway?
Like how's he doing?
Fighting the,

1219
01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:54.960
they just got announced in Toronto.
Yeah,

1220
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:58.380
he's getting to go bad weight cut from what I hear.

1221
01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.840
Real bad way cut.
Yup.

1222
01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.470
So how the fuck is he going to wait and make that way again?
Probably go,

1223
01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:09.060
what did we do last camp and Redo everything.
I mean he's so big,

1224
01:12:09.061 --> 01:12:12.410
dude.
He's so big or take is big too though,
man.

1225
01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.890
He figured this out but he hasn't been doing it as long.
Like the the,

1226
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.820
I think the thing about the weight cutting is,

1227
01:12:17.821 --> 01:12:20.040
and this is like one of the things that I've been learning,

1228
01:12:20.041 --> 01:12:22.120
talking to nutritionists and guys who,

1229
01:12:22.150 --> 01:12:25.740
who diet and guys who get ready for bodybuilding competitions,

1230
01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:29.850
like talking to Eileen Norton last week,
who is a,
he's a scientist,

1231
01:12:29.851 --> 01:12:33.540
like a legit phd as well as a guy who's competed in bodybuilding.
He's like,

1232
01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:34.000
she's,

1233
01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.000
your body does not want to do that and your body tries to protect you from doing

1234
01:12:39.061 --> 01:12:42.090
it and the more times you do it that more and more difficult.

1235
01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:47.091
It is free to do weight cutting is the number one primary problem with MMA

1236
01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.410
hundred percent you got to listen to Karma Carter's interview that did with Mac

1237
01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:50.460
life.
You talked about weight cutting.

1238
01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.520
What did he say it just a I d I missed that part,
but he,

1239
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:55.280
he talks about it how you know,
the,

1240
01:12:55.281 --> 01:12:57.960
the weight cutting was an issue and how dangerous it is and it's not good.

1241
01:12:58.020 --> 01:13:00.630
It's fuck yeah,
he,
he touches on that.
Yeah.

1242
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:03.690
Dustin poray talked about that too and he said that he thinks everybody should

1243
01:13:03.691 --> 01:13:04.710
go up one way class,

1244
01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.670
but then you know what is happening with this 165 pound title because they were

1245
01:13:08.671 --> 01:13:11.130
going to have Nate Diaz fight.
Dustin.

1246
01:13:11.131 --> 01:13:14.070
Both those guys came out and said they're going to be fighting for the title.

1247
01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:16.140
They came up with that game plan,
which I love.

1248
01:13:16.141 --> 01:13:19.680
They tried forcing the UFC his hand today.
Yeah,
it was their idea,

1249
01:13:19.681 --> 01:13:21.630
which is hardly that.
C'Mon.

1250
01:13:21.690 --> 01:13:26.640
I mean that's the plan and then the UFC is like,
no,
they're not.
Like Dana goes,

1251
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:30.000
I don't know why they keep saying this stuff.
Nate's,
they sign a contract.

1252
01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:33.150
They're finding at 55 65 no,
they're not fine.

1253
01:13:33.210 --> 01:13:36.580
Fine at 65 really know that.
That that,
that they're not fun.

1254
01:13:36.581 --> 01:13:38.850
It made the Nate Diaz and does support.

1255
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:42.660
I thought it'd be great to find at 65 for a title.
Really?

1256
01:13:42.661 --> 01:13:43.830
That's not the UFC his idea.

1257
01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.200
I made that up so the UFC had to repost like notes 55 so it was like Destinee,

1258
01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:52.950
Hey,
what's up?
What's up dude?
Maida Vale failure.
I know.
Let's do this,
man.

1259
01:13:52.951 --> 01:13:55.080
Let's say we're going to fight this grade five.
All right,
fuck it.

1260
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.470
You know I'm a fuck you.
I'll fuck you up.
Yeah,
it's,

1261
01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.250
I thought it was buying and then they tried forcing EFCs hand and then Dana to

1262
01:14:02.251 --> 01:14:04.170
come out and they know that.
So people,

1263
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:06.900
and then when they told him it's not happening,
you know,
there's no belt.

1264
01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:10.650
There's no six five pound belt.
Nate was like,
oh fuck it.
I'm out.
Well it's,

1265
01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:15.630
what is
this is nick saying,
I'm happy to announce on bringing a neon blue,

1266
01:14:15.631 --> 01:14:20.380
what does that 165 pound belt super fighter division.
What does that mean?

1267
01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:22.230
<v 4>Okay.</v>

1268
01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:27.150
<v 2>He is just this dim like trolling the UFC,
which is hilarious.
And then,</v>

1269
01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:29.730
uh,
Dustin goes,
it's been a long journey,

1270
01:14:29.731 --> 01:14:34.380
but here we are a New York City first ever once he brought down title UFC one
65,

1271
01:14:34.930 --> 01:14:38.970
like how he hashtag Thug Jitsu shout out to Eve Edwards.
Uh,
it's hilarious.

1272
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.760
But then you look at it and uh,

1273
01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:46.920
Dana White did absolutely no truth to it.
No,
it just doesn't make any sense.

1274
01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:49.650
But the,
here's the thing,
if there was true to it,

1275
01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.910
maybe you could sell that title better,
that that card better.

1276
01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:56.700
If that's the title five,
but you don't have a clue what you should do.

1277
01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.800
They fucking teen it up for you.
What are you waiting for?

1278
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:06.270
But have that as well as the main event.
Do all right.
Get another main event.

1279
01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:09.570
Why not go?
All right.
Fuck my ego.
Let's do it.
Nate.

1280
01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:13.830
Dustin wants 65 world title,
New Division.
Everyone's all crunk for it.

1281
01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:17.160
If John Jones or whoever we're trying to get out so it works great.

1282
01:15:17.190 --> 01:15:20.640
That's going to hype this thing.
You'd be more but a month out.
Do that.

1283
01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.540
I would love dus important and Nate Diaz can headline this fucking mask

1284
01:15:24.541 --> 01:15:27.810
regarding card.
Yeah.
It's insane.
Not to announce someone,

1285
01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:32.500
but I think they want something bigger.
I think they want Jon Jones,
but ah,

1286
01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:35.310
but at one 65 title,
why not just,

1287
01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:40.460
why not just the appetizer?
That's it.
Deep heavy appetizers to Celtic.

1288
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:43.190
Here's the craziest of crazy questions.
Please.

1289
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:44.790
Here's the craziest of crazy questions.

1290
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:49.530
DC is supposed to be fighting Brock motherfucking last dorm right out for the

1291
01:15:49.531 --> 01:15:52.170
heavyweight title.
But that's next year.

1292
01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:58.670
John Jones versus DC for the heavyweight title in Madison Square Garden.

1293
01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:02.003
<v 4>Yeah,</v>

1294
01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.900
<v 2>it's not happening,
but hey,
why not?
Because [inaudible] said he can't.</v>

1295
01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:07.590
They want him to fight camp.
What happened?

1296
01:16:08.140 --> 01:16:10.740
Because he wants to find that light heavyweight and uh,

1297
01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.920
John and I think Dana One fight heavyweight,

1298
01:16:12.921 --> 01:16:15.520
but he wants to do it at light heavyweight.
He doesn't want to do it.

1299
01:16:15.521 --> 01:16:19.710
A heavyweight,
he doesn't want to fight John at at heavyweight light heavyweight.

1300
01:16:19.730 --> 01:16:22.220
That's always been saying,
oh,
somebody needs to pull him aside.

1301
01:16:22.221 --> 01:16:25.580
Give him a fat bucket of Popeye's fried chicken because that's his favorite.

1302
01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:30.080
Bye Bye.
Fat Buck.
You mean fat bucket of cash?
So I was going to say next.
Okay.

1303
01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:35.300
I was say to say a briefcase slide back up frank trucks on other briefcases that

1304
01:16:35.301 --> 01:16:40.030
has those click click things on it.
You lift it up.
Oh,
if I'm DC,

1305
01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:44.510
I'm not doing that.
I'm going hold up.
I'm going to fight Brock in January,

1306
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:47.000
February.
I'm going to get paid.
I'm gonna beat the shit out of Brock,
right?

1307
01:16:47.001 --> 01:16:48.090
That's a big payday for me.

1308
01:16:48.620 --> 01:16:53.000
And then have John Fight cane have John fight steep at heavyweight.

1309
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:56.180
Let's see how he looks.
If he looks human,
I'll fight that full.

1310
01:16:56.210 --> 01:16:58.310
But if he looks like Uber Remat heavyweight,

1311
01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:02.280
I'll see you on the other side and I'm fucking retiring.
That is a fight,
right?

1312
01:17:02.281 --> 01:17:05.270
Steve Bay versus John Jones at heavyweight and Madison Square Garden.

1313
01:17:05.271 --> 01:17:08.870
That would be a giant fight.
Huge fight.
That's a giant headliner.

1314
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:10.243
That's a headline

1315
01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:14.420
<v 0>twice,
I guess my debit card.
Now here's one for you though.</v>

1316
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:19.310
Why not like a see Connor versed,
uh,

1317
01:17:19.311 --> 01:17:22.480
could be the same biggest fight of all time.
UFC history,
paper use.

1318
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:27.320
I don't think so.
But let's say DC to beat Brock.
John Beats Steep Bay.

1319
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:31.580
John Deasy the trilogy at heavyweight for the world title.

1320
01:17:31.670 --> 01:17:35.960
You don't think that's bigger than this fight this weekend?
To me it's bigger.
No,

1321
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:39.170
it's not bigger because Conor McGregor is a bigger,
what does this,

1322
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:43.130
we might see Daniel Cormier,
Jon Jones trilogy had heavyweight.
Ah Ha.

1323
01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:48.440
See what I'm saying?
See what I'm saying on a force.
My boy,

1324
01:17:48.441 --> 01:17:50.390
D C and shit.
He doesn't want to do bro.

1325
01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.160
<v 5>Uh,</v>

1326
01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:57.230
<v 0>stay strong DC.
None.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Take the fight.
No.</v>

1327
01:17:57.270 --> 01:18:01.050
Take that file.
Fight Brock.
Listen,
John's been off a long time.

1328
01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:04.530
Do you remember when he came back ends omen St Pru wasn't the best.
That's true.

1329
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:07.830
This might be the time.
What a great story for DC.

1330
01:18:07.831 --> 01:18:11.820
Free to if you were beat John and then riding off into the sunset,

1331
01:18:14.130 --> 01:18:18.720
managing that
and then rides off into the sunset to play devil's advocate.

1332
01:18:18.721 --> 01:18:20.240
What if he gets head kicked again?
Heavyweight,

1333
01:18:20.290 --> 01:18:25.050
who's his boss felt everyone was like,
well,
there you go.
Well look,
John Is,

1334
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:27.990
if not the best ever,
he's one of the best at,

1335
01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:31.490
I think he's the best ever with mighty mouse having lost its,

1336
01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:36.120
it's a real good argument I think in terms of like the overall ability to get

1337
01:18:36.121 --> 01:18:38.550
things done.
You got to look at what he's done.

1338
01:18:38.550 --> 01:18:41.940
He's never lost the only loss to Matt Hamill and that was a bullshit law.

1339
01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:45.540
We get the guys he's fought to,
fought my way,
beat them.
Two killers.

1340
01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.510
Remember when he choked Leo down and just dropped him.

1341
01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.660
This just fell in a clump and then the,
then the,

1342
01:18:51.661 --> 01:18:55.110
what he did to fucking [inaudible] bell four submitted.
Peter was like,

1343
01:18:55.111 --> 01:19:00.090
you're a black belt.
Vick.
Conor McGregor.
Not Keen on facing GSP next,

1344
01:19:00.091 --> 01:19:04.140
but interested in Anderson Silva.
Get that shit out of my face.
Kind of what,

1345
01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:07.110
why would he not be interested in facing GSP?

1346
01:19:07.111 --> 01:19:10.740
But he's interested in facing Anderson and [inaudible] of one 85 pounder.

1347
01:19:11.340 --> 01:19:13.440
We'll see what happens next.
But I don't think GSP is next.

1348
01:19:13.441 --> 01:19:15.630
He doesn't have anything for me personally.

1349
01:19:15.631 --> 01:19:19.440
I'm not going to shut the door on that down the line.

1350
01:19:19.740 --> 01:19:23.070
You know what would be another great one?
Anderson Silva.

1351
01:19:23.071 --> 01:19:26.880
I think he thinks Anderson is slow.
The shitty down.

1352
01:19:27.180 --> 01:19:30.540
George has not slowed down yet.
Uh,

1353
01:19:30.541 --> 01:19:35.460
Georgia 55 verse Connor's amazing fight.
Well,
it's 70.
It's an amazing fight.

1354
01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:39.350
Did not find it.
70 no.
Nope.
No Way.
Nope,
not happening.
Wait,

1355
01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.440
what makes you say that?

1356
01:19:43.870 --> 01:19:47.410
What makes you say that you've seen a Georgia?
He looks pretty svelte.
Well,

1357
01:19:47.411 --> 01:19:50.380
I saw one picture of him when he was in the sauna.

1358
01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:54.970
When people say he's making a test cut to 55 astro boy for us.

1359
01:19:55.270 --> 01:19:59.020
What can ask George?
That's George.
He's calm up right now.
Call him up.

1360
01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:02.310
That's I phone.
You think he's gonna give us a real answer on it?

1361
01:20:02.311 --> 01:20:06.880
Anybody during either.
Sometimes Brian Does the nightmare.
It's probably rude,

1362
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:10.590
right?
Have,
they're like what?
You're on the air.
Hey,
it's Rogan and shop.

1363
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.170
Is there any way you're going to fight?
And they're like,
dude,
come on.

1364
01:20:13.450 --> 01:20:14.011
Dad is like,

1365
01:20:14.011 --> 01:20:18.810
he's leaning in and that that image of him at one 70 is in the middle of a

1366
01:20:18.811 --> 01:20:23.730
fight.
So he's all pumped up with muscle is his muscles are inflated,

1367
01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:29.220
you know,
hey,
might actually be trying to make 55 he does look very slim there.

1368
01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:33.360
This is what I've heard through the grapevine.
GSP wants to,

1369
01:20:33.390 --> 01:20:38.390
wants to fight and the fight he wants up to is that 55 but it's only a Connor

1370
01:20:39.211 --> 01:20:43.980
wins.
Really.
He doesn't think beating could be,
would be like a legacy fight for,

1371
01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.420
well,
I'll tell you what,
in terms of paper view,
that would be a giant fight.

1372
01:20:48.450 --> 01:20:53.340
Conor GSP,
especially after GSP.
Boy beat beat.

1373
01:20:53.341 --> 01:20:58.110
Bisbing got 800,000 pay per view buys after two how many years out of the game

1374
01:20:58.140 --> 01:21:02.320
for four years out of the year layoff,
four year layoff comes back beat.

1375
01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:05.550
And I'll tell you what,
man,
when he did my podcast,
he's super lucid.

1376
01:21:05.551 --> 01:21:09.330
He's there 100% yeah,
like all that wrestling him.
Good,
brilliant.

1377
01:21:09.331 --> 01:21:14.250
Got arrested him.
Good smart,
smart guy.
That's a fine.
A giant fight.

1378
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:18.990
That's a giant fight.
And he probably be vulnerable at 55 yeah,
it's a good life.

1379
01:21:19.050 --> 01:21:22.770
It's good.
Fight for counter.
Good fight for Georgia faster.
I mean,

1380
01:21:22.771 --> 01:21:23.850
would it be fair he wouldn't,

1381
01:21:23.950 --> 01:21:26.700
wouldn't necessarily be faster at 55 I don't think so.

1382
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:30.000
I think you'd be so diminished.
Yeah.
I think it'd be solid offices,

1383
01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:30.930
techniques still there.

1384
01:21:30.931 --> 01:21:35.070
But I think 70 that's George all day 85 not so much.

1385
01:21:35.071 --> 01:21:37.590
That boy looked thick.
Yeah.

1386
01:21:37.591 --> 01:21:39.840
But he said he had a real hard time keeping that weight on it.

1387
01:21:39.841 --> 01:21:44.040
Fucked up his intestines.
Yeah,
whatever it was.
His digestive systems thick.

1388
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:48.960
So he's eating all day trying to keep the mass on.
Yeah,
that's a rough one.

1389
01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:53.100
Yeah,
he's got some sort of a stomach issue now.
Collitus yeah,
that's right.
Yeah.

1390
01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.550
From and he said he got it from just eating like a fucking pig while he's

1391
01:21:56.551 --> 01:21:59.970
training.
Like he was always like almost throwing up Jesus Christ.
Yeah.

1392
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.340
Yeah.
Not Good.
Um,

1393
01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.840
what else is on this card this weekend?
Pull it.
Pull.
Other than that man,

1394
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:14.860
what do we got?
Michelle Waterson.
Felice.
Eric.

1395
01:22:14.861 --> 01:22:18.770
That's good to fucking fight yet.
Little Pettis fight and juicy.
Yay for Megan.

1396
01:22:20.490 --> 01:22:23.100
Yeah.
Tick in the box and world.
You've got Deontay wilder,

1397
01:22:23.101 --> 01:22:26.220
Tyson fury fight men doing the press conference Wednesday.

1398
01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:31.050
I know that's an interesting fight to get fired with Teddy Atlas said about

1399
01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:35.040
Deontay wilder.
Just how hard he can hit.
He called him Thor is,

1400
01:22:35.060 --> 01:22:39.210
he's got that hammer.
How great's Teddy Atlas.
It's great.

1401
01:22:39.630 --> 01:22:42.700
That was a fun interview yet.
I didn't get to the end,
but he,

1402
01:22:42.701 --> 01:22:47.370
he mentioned something of it where he was saying how he thinks an issue and I

1403
01:22:47.371 --> 01:22:49.740
never really thought about until you brought up,
I've never thought about it.

1404
01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:50.401
How in bought,

1405
01:22:50.401 --> 01:22:53.550
when [inaudible] came a little corrupt and got a little weird for him is when

1406
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:58.110
the fighters started have their own promotions in,
in with the boxing world.

1407
01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:01.520
Right?
Like the promoters and the fives working together.
And now we see,

1408
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:03.420
we're starting to see this now with the UFC.

1409
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:07.240
We're going down the same road with condom,
with McGregor promotions in the UFC.

1410
01:23:07.241 --> 01:23:08.380
Now they're in cahoots.
Right.

1411
01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:12.100
But he's also talking about how the promoters would take out the judges to

1412
01:23:12.101 --> 01:23:16.870
dinner,
you know,
and he's like that.
That's a total conflict of interest was me.

1413
01:23:16.871 --> 01:23:19.840
Even if you're not paying them,
they're,
they're eating at the nicest places,

1414
01:23:20.020 --> 01:23:24.520
drinking the nicest wine.
So sketchy man.
Yeah.
So sketchy.

1415
01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:29.360
It's legal in some sort of strange loop.
Holy Way.
It's very strange.
Yeah.

1416
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:33.060
What else is coming up down the future?
What else is going on?
Like what's a,

1417
01:23:33.061 --> 01:23:36.490
another big fight?
December,
the December card,

1418
01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:40.780
you got Cyborg Nunez happening now,
that December card in Toronto,

1419
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:44.450
no December card.
Toronto's Briner Taiko Holloway,
right.
There's,

1420
01:23:44.710 --> 01:23:47.680
and so there's another December car,
New Year's card,

1421
01:23:47.681 --> 01:23:50.830
you know when they do it right.
Oh,
so there's two paper views.

1422
01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:55.860
This is like pretty sure the place that Valentina Shevchenko versus CJR.

1423
01:23:55.890 --> 01:24:00.400
You banks what bumped it for the vacant flyweight title?
What headline?

1424
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:05.130
UFC Two 30 I thought,
but I thought Yolanda.
Yeah.
Yup.
Okay.

1425
01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.570
Is this just coming out today?
Just how I was.

1426
01:24:07.630 --> 01:24:10.960
I was about to show you a tweet that said that they were talking about moving it

1427
01:24:10.961 --> 01:24:14.230
up and it was in flux and then when I went to look for it,
oh wait,

1428
01:24:14.231 --> 01:24:18.190
that's going to headline math square garden.
What?

1429
01:24:18.850 --> 01:24:22.030
I've lost all energy in my body.
What?
Oh yeah,

1430
01:24:22.031 --> 01:24:23.890
because that gets my Dick Carter.

1431
01:24:23.891 --> 01:24:28.540
Then Dustin poray was Nate Diaz for 145 pound title.
No,

1432
01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:29.291
no offense,

1433
01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:34.291
but I don't even know who says Yara Eubanks is and I'm the commentator for the

1434
01:24:34.301 --> 01:24:38.530
UFC.
I've never heard of her.
I am not being a dick either.

1435
01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:42.910
I'm just saying as far as headline,
Mass Square Garden,
you got some nerve,

1436
01:24:42.911 --> 01:24:46.510
whoever put this together.
Let's see a video on this young lady.

1437
01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:51.370
I'm sure she's an absolute monster and good for her.
She is it.
Congrats.

1438
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:55.990
Looks scary.
How many fights did she have?
She's in the UFC.

1439
01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:57.350
She's one file up,

1440
01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:02.380
one fight in the UFC and she was born too foreign too.
Okay,

1441
01:25:03.790 --> 01:25:05.380
and what happened with you,
Ana?

1442
01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.200
She must got injured or some shit you on.
This is the previous tweet was this?

1443
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:17.520
Well,
this is Brett Okamoto.
He's a reliable source.
Remember Espn?

1444
01:25:17.970 --> 01:25:21.330
The UFC now supposed to face Yolanda,
but that may change.

1445
01:25:21.331 --> 01:25:23.970
Two of the switch happens.
Okay.

1446
01:25:23.971 --> 01:25:26.820
Per sources they've discussed moving volunteer shift Chanko.

1447
01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:30.750
Is this the previous previous one and then he made another one saying that it's

1448
01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:31.584
locked down?
Correct.

1449
01:25:31.670 --> 01:25:33.020
<v 4>Wow.</v>

1450
01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:39.500
<v 0>Okay.
Yeah.
Britney spears.
The,</v>

1451
01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:43.630
who's that dude?
What's that guy's name?
Christopher [inaudible] Tano.

1452
01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:47.280
Chris underscore kiss Dano.
That's hilarious.
He put that Brittany Spears of

1453
01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.620
that is these poor girls.
That sucks for them,

1454
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.150
but the magnitude of maths square garden,
you're thinking it's going to be,

1455
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:59.290
so I was thinking Joan's fucking Cain Velasquez.

1456
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:01.880
I'm Steve Bay Jones,
DC.

1457
01:26:01.900 --> 01:26:04.460
Less something that would blow my hair back.

1458
01:26:04.461 --> 01:26:08.330
Then I can hold up Valentine against the girl was foreign to with one fight in

1459
01:26:08.331 --> 01:26:11.750
the UFC for the flyway title is and then we'll go Montana.

1460
01:26:11.751 --> 01:26:16.160
They stripped her because she didn't make weight for one fight.
But yeah.

1461
01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:20.540
Those are your friends Joe.
Hey,
just kidding.
Listen man.

1462
01:26:20.541 --> 01:26:24.360
I don't want to be a promoter.
Fuck that.
You just keep doing it then.
Fuck,
fuck,

1463
01:26:24.361 --> 01:26:27.850
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck,
fuck that job.
Fuck.
You'll be working.

1464
01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.800
I was going to say we could have done a companion just fricking.
Yeah,
Ham.
I know.

1465
01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:37.640
We could damn it.
When are we going to do,
when is everyone together?

1466
01:26:37.641 --> 01:26:41.420
When are you not working?
I don't know.
What am I under the hour again?
Well,
I'm a,

1467
01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.670
I'm chilling out for a while now that uh,

1468
01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.870
I got that show that I did in Toronto on Saturday night.

1469
01:26:46.871 --> 01:26:51.290
It was my last big show for a long time and you to chill quite a while because

1470
01:26:51.291 --> 01:26:56.090
you got to get another hour.
Yeah,
I'm at like 25 minutes,
24 minutes.

1471
01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:59.280
You still going to be doing sets or it might be nice taking a little break,

1472
01:26:59.470 --> 01:27:02.770
taking this week off.
Just the week of,
yeah,
just relaxing.

1473
01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:06.560
Then go into the UFC this weekend.
Yeah,
hanging out with the family.
Yeah.

1474
01:27:06.561 --> 01:27:10.910
I'm just looking forward to just,
I did it.
It's out now.

1475
01:27:10.911 --> 01:27:12.560
I'm a chill and then I need to,

1476
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:16.290
we need to wait till October is over so I could do some mushrooms and he gets,

1477
01:27:16.291 --> 01:27:20.150
no,
no,
my Dario.
Hey,
you're in sober.
Sober,
sober October.

1478
01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:22.730
Are you going to do sober October?
I don't drink or smoke.
Really.

1479
01:27:22.731 --> 01:27:26.000
I have nothing to be sober to say.
You're doing it.
I mean she,
I mean,
yeah,

1480
01:27:26.001 --> 01:27:29.540
I do it year round,
but sure.
I want to get involved in the fitness challenge.

1481
01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:31.760
Yeah,
that's easy.
Let's do that.
I'll get you in that.

1482
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:34.670
I got an extra one of these things.
Really?
All right,
let's do it.
Okay.

1483
01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.910
I just work out with you guys.
You're in for,
I mean a man.
What is it?

1484
01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:42.620
What do I get to wear this thing right here?
The head.
Can I turn into a headband?

1485
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:47.770
No.
You put it around your waist.
Oh,
sick chests and then I download the APP.
Yeah.

1486
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:52.270
All right.
I'm in one of those.
I ordered an extra one.
Fuck yeah.
Thanks dude.

1487
01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:56.000
Right?
I'm in,
Dude.
Yeah.
It's not much for me though,

1488
01:27:56.001 --> 01:28:00.110
cause I don't really drink or smoke or anything like Stan hopes a big one.
Yeah.

1489
01:28:00.140 --> 01:28:03.080
He's got to go to a doctor.
Standing up is getting measured.

1490
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:06.770
He's getting his blood work done and the doctor is going to go,

1491
01:28:06.771 --> 01:28:07.604
you should be dead.

1492
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:10.610
I met him for the first time at the comedy store is Super Nice Guy.
Oh,

1493
01:28:10.611 --> 01:28:13.310
he's the best.
Unless you heard about him forever.
Yeah.
Really Nice Guy.

1494
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:16.560
He's a sweetheart.
I just think guys going to be mean to me for what reason?

1495
01:28:16.590 --> 01:28:19.970
Smiling.
Complex,
but he's super nice.
He's going to be mean to you.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1496
01:28:19.971 --> 01:28:24.880
because a few of them have been,
yeah,
somehow.
Yeah.
Fuck this guy.

1497
01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:29.000
People do they think you're infringing on their turf?
You know,
I get it.

1498
01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:33.530
It's stupid.
I 100% comedy is everybody's turf.
If you can do it,
you can do it.

1499
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:37.550
As long as you don't steal,
it's everybody's turf.
As long as the crowds laughing,

1500
01:28:37.551 --> 01:28:39.770
you don't steal the crowds in the laughter,
then yeah,

1501
01:28:39.771 --> 01:28:42.830
I don't belong to be there but don't steal and you know,

1502
01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:46.430
come up with your own shit and be nice to people and everyone should let you in.

1503
01:28:46.431 --> 01:28:50.810
We're all freaks and miss fits the idea that one type of freaking misfit is okay

1504
01:28:50.811 --> 01:28:54.320
but another type isn't.
Yeah.
You know,
I had to deal with that.
My,

1505
01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:56.420
especially early on.

1506
01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:00.200
You self conscious early on because you're a bigger dude and you have tattoos

1507
01:29:00.201 --> 01:29:01.830
where you self conscious of it.
Yeah.

1508
01:29:01.831 --> 01:29:05.280
That's why to this day I always go on stage with long sleeve shirts.

1509
01:29:05.281 --> 01:29:09.600
I people say,
oh,
like one of the things that people said about,
um,
strange times,

1510
01:29:09.601 --> 01:29:11.700
like,
why don't you wear fucking shirts that fit you?

1511
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:14.410
Because I don't feel good and sure it's a fit.
Me.
I mean,
I,

1512
01:29:14.411 --> 01:29:18.540
I don't mind wearing a shirt that fits me to the movies or to a restaurant or

1513
01:29:18.541 --> 01:29:19.051
something like that.

1514
01:29:19.051 --> 01:29:24.051
Stage yourself loose things that don't show muscle.

1515
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:28.980
They don't show any.
I don't want anybody looking at my body.
Yeah,
I hear Ya.
Yeah,

1516
01:29:29.010 --> 01:29:33.300
mainly.
Yeah.
Like you gotta you couldn't go onstage with a fucking tank top on.

1517
01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:36.720
People are like fuck this guy.
Right.
And he has skinny jeans on.

1518
01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.930
Theo goes on stage with a tank top.
I know.
It's all good.
I know.

1519
01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.010
You know what I mean?
You can create a problem.

1520
01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:46.110
Don't tell Brian he can prime to get upset.

1521
01:29:47.020 --> 01:29:51.720
So no cock guys just think of ripped.
Nah,
come on.
Do a lot of body weight work.

1522
01:29:53.610 --> 01:29:58.320
You know what I found a legit massage lady.
All my God,

1523
01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:02.400
this lady tortured me the other day.
Do I know her?
No.
She's um,

1524
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:07.740
she is a trigger point specialist and she gets,

1525
01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:12.810
she's a strong lady and she gets that fucking elbow in your bag.
Big Girl.

1526
01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.970
Ooh.
Yeah.
She's a big hand.
She's big late.

1527
01:30:14.971 --> 01:30:19.440
That's how you know she's fucking strong card.
Yeah,
she broke me.

1528
01:30:19.470 --> 01:30:23.220
That distracts me.
But it's good for you to my whole back to this day,

1529
01:30:23.221 --> 01:30:24.690
still sore was two days ago.

1530
01:30:24.691 --> 01:30:28.410
I got the massage and the areas where she broke down our soar,

1531
01:30:28.411 --> 01:30:31.800
like she fucked me up,
but she paid my ass.
That was in an hour long though.

1532
01:30:31.890 --> 01:30:35.790
She did 90 minutes.
She dripping wet with sweat,
wet like hey.

1533
01:30:36.090 --> 01:30:38.660
It's like pros and cons,
right?
It's like you either get the bigger,

1534
01:30:38.661 --> 01:30:42.510
the sweats and takes up all the oxygen in the room or you get the soft Asian

1535
01:30:42.511 --> 01:30:45.750
girl.
It's not a good massage.
No,
I don't want that.
I want to get hurt.
Yeah,

1536
01:30:45.751 --> 01:30:46.001
me too,

1537
01:30:46.001 --> 01:30:49.320
because she loosened up a lot of shit that was bothering the fuck out of me.

1538
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:52.230
I realized the importance of that and I haven't been doing it.

1539
01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:56.790
I'll tell you what,
when I do yoga regularly,
I don't need as much massage,

1540
01:30:56.791 --> 01:31:00.370
but I think even then you need it.
You needed everything to be king,

1541
01:31:00.450 --> 01:31:05.070
all the kinks to be worked out broken down and yeah,
I love massages,
man.

1542
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:06.660
You know,
the Russian Olympic team,

1543
01:31:06.900 --> 01:31:08.910
I was reading something about a Russian athletes.

1544
01:31:08.911 --> 01:31:11.910
They would get massages every day on tons of steroids,
but yeah,
sure.

1545
01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:19.080
It makes sense.
Did you ever have that guy,
Bryan Fogel on your podcast?

1546
01:31:19.440 --> 01:31:22.260
Bryan Fogel.
He's the guy that directed ICARUS.
No,

1547
01:31:22.261 --> 01:31:25.980
I didn't it did you see Hickory?
I saw liquors a ridiculous should have him on.

1548
01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:27.270
He's amazing.
Here's my thing,
Joe,

1549
01:31:27.271 --> 01:31:30.630
like when you had teddy atlas on for for him to come on in three hours,

1550
01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:34.110
you have that uh,
Bryan Fogel or whoever,
when they do three hours on this,

1551
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.360
there's not much more I can cover.
Sure.

1552
01:31:36.361 --> 01:31:39.690
I'll throw in some dick jokes or something and I got talking about dicks and

1553
01:31:39.691 --> 01:31:41.910
fashion,
but once they go here,

1554
01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:46.590
like I don't want to say that.
No,
no.
Their conversations,

1555
01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:50.500
the conversation about it as a kind of say shape for three hours.
Yeah,

1556
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:52.860
but believe me,
you're going to cover it in a different way.

1557
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.430
It's always how it is.
You're going to have your own take on things,

1558
01:31:55.450 --> 01:31:58.650
especially as a guy who's actually fought professionally but actually played

1559
01:31:58.651 --> 01:32:00.190
football.
My only thing is

1560
01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:04.540
<v 2>as a ma,
it's my own things.
Like if I hear it on your show for three hours,</v>

1561
01:32:04.780 --> 01:32:07.510
I don't want to go over it on my show.
I'm like,
I know this guy.

1562
01:32:07.511 --> 01:32:10.870
It's not a mystery anymore.
I see what you're saying.
I see what you're saying.

1563
01:32:10.871 --> 01:32:14.780
But I don't think,
I don't think that way.
You're like,
I,

1564
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:17.830
when I heard Jocko on Tim Ferriss,
I didn't say,
oh,

1565
01:32:17.831 --> 01:32:21.220
I don't want to have that guy on because Tim Ferriss covered it thoroughly,

1566
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:25.700
which he did a different,
yeah.
Different.
I hear you though.
I hear it.

1567
01:32:26.050 --> 01:32:28.240
Like with Justin rent,
he's like,
dude,

1568
01:32:28.241 --> 01:32:30.590
coming to town doing rogue and I'll do yours after Mike.

1569
01:32:31.110 --> 01:32:34.630
If you're talking about kids and water in Africa for three hours in rogue and

1570
01:32:34.631 --> 01:32:39.460
you really don't need to do mine bro.
But he's Rafael Lovato.
Yeah,

1571
01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:45.530

Like I'm not,

uh,

1572
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:49.180

I'll help it,
but he doesn't need come on my show to do.

1581
01:33:18.461 --> 01:33:20.710
If he didn't yell at him for three hours,
I'll do whatever you want.

1582
01:33:20.711 --> 01:33:22.660
What seem like make sure I don't forget his name.

1583
01:33:22.661 --> 01:33:26.800
It seemed like I was on the plane the other day,

1586
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:38.470

1589
01:33:48.461 --> 01:33:52.810

1617
01:35:37.670 --> 01:35:40.130
we have to figure some out here.
That's when I saw that.
I'm like,

1618
01:35:40.131 --> 01:35:44.410
what the fuck man.
That's awesome man.
I love that.
I love that about you.
Yeah,

1619
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:48.160
lucky you.
I know.
I didn't mean to talk about and yeah,
I guess,

1620
01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.790
I don't know how we got brought up on that,

1621
01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.310
but I reached out to them and then I think he thought like,
Oh,

1622
01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:55.800
I'm sure I'm not going to donate it like $100 or something,
man.
Yeah.

1623
01:35:56.210 --> 01:35:59.210
Well maybe just was overwhelmed,
you know?
That's what I'm thinking.

1624
01:35:59.211 --> 01:35:59.830
That's why I'm,

1625
01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:02.690
I'm sure he listened to the show and I know he loves to buy on the kid and I

1626
01:36:02.691 --> 01:36:03.860
just thought of it now.
Well,

1627
01:36:03.861 --> 01:36:07.910
imagine the amount of time that it must be taking up too.

1628
01:36:08.150 --> 01:36:09.200
Not just trained,

1629
01:36:09.201 --> 01:36:13.700
but also to deal with the son and his son's medical issues and the family and

1630
01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:17.480
the bills and all the kids off.
Yeah.
I set up my son's stubs,
his toe,

1631
01:36:17.481 --> 01:36:21.860
my heart drops,
man.
Yeah,
it's hard.
Man.
Falls on the ground like funny.
Crazy.

1632
01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:23.810
Did you ever feel so vulnerable and you're,
oh my God,

1633
01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:27.660
I'm terrified of the world now.
Terrified.
I'll be driving my car.
I'm like,
Yo,

1634
01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.980
slow down there.
Do you think of people different now that you have a kid?

1635
01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.540
Do you hundred percent I'm way more.

1636
01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.760
I'm way more like I'm more scared of the world.
I feel like a more loving now.

1637
01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:42.410
I also,
if I have friends who are Shitty Dad,
I barely hang out with them anymore.

1638
01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.980
And the whole resent against cause I'm like that too.

1639
01:36:44.981 --> 01:36:49.190
That little dude need you so bad,
man.
Yeah.
Now I feel the same way.

1640
01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:52.530
Yeah.
Um,
you know,
the thing is like,

1641
01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.810
I feel sad for people who don't make the transition.

1642
01:36:57.380 --> 01:37:01.430
You know,
there's,
there's a transition to being a father that some people resist.

1643
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:05.900
Yep.
Where it becomes the primary focus of your life,
it becomes a big,
big,

1644
01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:07.940
big deal.
But if you make that transition,

1645
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:12.970
the love that comes out of that and the change that it brings about in you and

1646
01:37:13.551 --> 01:37:18.110
the benefits for your child there so substantial.
Ah,
I mean,

1647
01:37:18.150 --> 01:37:21.320
and it's so cliche.
It's the,
Oh,
it's the best thing I've ever done.
Straight up,

1648
01:37:21.321 --> 01:37:24.590
man.
I've had a cool fucking life.
It is by far the best thing I've ever done.

1649
01:37:24.650 --> 01:37:29.090
I want a squad I want,
because the love I get from that little dude,
I'm like,

1650
01:37:29.690 --> 01:37:31.700
three of you would be even cooler.
Yeah.

1651
01:37:31.701 --> 01:37:34.490
You're going to have more a hundred percent yeah.
Working on it right now.
Yup.

1652
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:38.990
Hundred percent shooting live ones a try,
man.
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
No,

1653
01:37:38.991 --> 01:37:43.250
this thing's working with whatever.
A fucking tail tail.

1654
01:37:44.540 --> 01:37:44.871
Yeah.

1655
01:37:44.871 --> 01:37:48.710
They say take zinc to take zinc and magnesium and I'm taking all these weird

1656
01:37:48.711 --> 01:37:49.260
pills.

1657
01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:53.900
It's now get that to get the load that come call you gotta save your loads too.

1658
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:56.190
I know.
A big

1659
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.470
<v 0>day.

Never forget it.

1662
01:38:07.530 --> 01:38:11.190
Dude.
I had to go get,

1663
01:38:11.191 --> 01:38:15.000

how my guys are swimming.
Well,
first of all,
it's not,

1664
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:17.040

They're like,

1665
01:38:17.050 --> 01:38:20.340
go just go down there was you grow with you when you had to give him a sample?

She was like busy talking to the guy in there.

1667
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:27.870
She was like talking to the doctor and he's like,
he'll just take you the back.

1668
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:29.910
I'm like,

Yeah,

1669
01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:32.550
so you had to jerk off knowing your girls and the other room too.

1670
01:38:32.551 --> 01:38:36.180
So I walk into this room,
it's just the Mexican dude just like,

They'll think you're old school TV.

1673
01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:48.990
V V v VCR like old school.
I'm like,

1674
01:38:48.991 --> 01:38:50.400

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:57.510

1676
01:38:59.010 --> 01:38:59.371

1680
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:14.270

He would have told my wife,

1681
01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.360
you're coming with me.
Do.

1682
01:39:15.361 --> 01:39:18.630
I felt like it was embarrassing to like ever like I'm like I can't,

1683
01:39:18.631 --> 01:39:22.120
I'm the thing in a bag and he just looks at it,
takes it out loads.
I'll do.

1684
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:25.980

1686
01:39:28.770 --> 01:39:31.320
And then when you're walking back to see everyone knows that you're coming back.

1687
01:39:31.321 --> 01:39:32.340
You just get done Jack.

1688
01:39:32.341 --> 01:39:36.060
And we should walk up with your arms up in the air like you scored the winning

1689
01:39:36.061 --> 01:39:39.420
touchdown.
Yes.
Joy that.

1690
01:39:39.450 --> 01:39:43.260
Fuck yes.
But what happened?
This is my thing.
This is my,

1691
01:39:43.261 --> 01:39:45.650
and I went kind of down to Eddie Bravo conspiracy.

1692
01:39:45.651 --> 01:39:48.460
I'm like water for like damn your sperms.
Not good dude.
We get,

1693
01:39:48.510 --> 01:39:51.000
we're going to need more low.
Take your spring.
Take that to like,

1694
01:39:51.001 --> 01:39:55.800

Big Dude.
We're gonna use his genetics.
Make me sell that shit.

1695
01:39:55.801 --> 01:39:57.930
Black market.
There's a bunch of little browns running around.

1696
01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:02.010
You know what has happened many times more than once is these doctors,

1697
01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:03.540
if fertility clinics swap out,

1698
01:40:03.541 --> 01:40:06.180
other peoples come for their own and they have a bunch of their,

1699
01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:07.800
their own babies running around.

1700
01:40:08.250 --> 01:40:11.720
Like these people have wanted specific genetics and this one redheaded doctor

1701
01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:15.090
just shoot loads of the cups and then everybody's like,
hey,

1702
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:20.310
why isn't my fucking kid have red hair?
The fuck?
Where's your revenue?

1703
01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:23.070
Nerdy man.
One doctor got arrested.

1704
01:40:23.071 --> 01:40:27.250
I think he fathered like a hundred children.
Oh my God.

1705
01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:32.250
Crazy,
crazy person or awesome back to the world.

1706
01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:35.970
I think he's just a crazy person because I stayed a seed.
Yeah,

1707
01:40:35.971 --> 01:40:38.130
he was running a sperm bank or a fertility clinic,

1708
01:40:38.131 --> 01:40:41.730
one of those and he just decided not.
It's going to be all me.

1709
01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:43.920
All my loads out there too.
Don't you think?

1710
01:40:43.921 --> 01:40:46.830
For like a retirement plan for these ads,
dude,

1711
01:40:48.150 --> 01:40:51.000
what does that image?
Oh,
okay.

1712
01:40:51.001 --> 01:40:53.840
It looks like cherish a bunch of these two accounts.

1713
01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:56.710
This does a bunch of these guys is not just one what?

1714
01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.650
1980 to 92 92 yeah.
No,
no.

1715
01:40:59.651 --> 01:41:04.030
I'm talking about like real resay the years in prison.
Oh yeah.
Shit.

1716
01:41:04.090 --> 01:41:08.620
He got to prison for that 280 years,
son,
280 years for jerking off.

1717
01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:11.080
Who could be seen to be saying,
oh dude,

1718
01:41:11.081 --> 01:41:14.770
don't you think you've very tired fighter,
let's say,
or athlete just in general.

1719
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:15.790
Like Hershel Walker,

1720
01:41:15.791 --> 01:41:18.880
someone pay him $1 million for him to blow a load into a cup.

1721
01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:21.620
Did you ever watch the HBO,
uh,

1722
01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:26.280
Expo a on beat crumb from the beak from Yoga and all?
Yeah,
he was fucking,

1723
01:41:26.290 --> 01:41:29.470
he was here he is Indiana fertility doctor uses own sperm.

1724
01:41:30.130 --> 01:41:35.080
This is 2016 around 50 times papers say,
wow,

1725
01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:36.250
this is a recent guy.

1726
01:41:36.610 --> 01:41:39.220
I think there's been a bunch of these guys throughout history.

1727
01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:43.120
I think they should test every one of those guys.

1728
01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.890
They should make sure that they're not doing that.

1729
01:41:45.010 --> 01:41:47.150
Anybody running a fertility clinic and tickets,

1730
01:41:47.151 --> 01:41:49.540
it's like you get bored over and over again.

1731
01:41:49.541 --> 01:41:52.140
Guys are jacking off in the cops and you're like,
you know what?
Make my day.

1732
01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:56.830
I think if I take out this load and put it in my rent's 600 children,

1733
01:41:56.860 --> 01:42:01.840
there you go.
Wow.
Father had 600 children and own fertility clinic.
Wow.

1734
01:42:01.841 --> 01:42:05.720
Repeatedly using his own sperm fertility clinic.
He ran.
Hey,

1735
01:42:06.010 --> 01:42:10.000
that's some sketchy shit,
man.
I'm telling you,
this is a normal thing.

1736
01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:13.900
Guys are gross.
Guys are men are gross.
Have a woman run that thing.

1737
01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:17.710
Women who were anti,
Amen.
Listen,
I swear to God,
we're not all like this,

1738
01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:21.190
but I get it.
I get it.
I really do get,
I talked about it in my special,

1739
01:42:21.191 --> 01:42:23.950
some creeps.
Yeah.
I mean I talked about it in this last special,

1740
01:42:23.951 --> 01:42:27.980
it's like I get it.
If I was a woman,
I'd be a feminist.
I get it.
Yeah,

1741
01:42:28.030 --> 01:42:31.230
we're fucking gross,
but not all of us.
Not all.
I would,

1742
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:35.470
I would never jerk off into 600 cups of pretend it was someone else's load.

1743
01:42:35.471 --> 01:42:37.300
Never even crossed my mind.
It's not me,

1744
01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:42.100
but I know that there's guys like that out there that does not surprise me in

1745
01:42:42.101 --> 01:42:45.880
the slightest.
The FISA,

1746
01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:50.940
I'm fucking fat gross guy with a little tiny dick and some woman with this

1747
01:42:51.370 --> 01:42:54.220
banging ass and little tiny waist.

1748
01:42:54.250 --> 01:42:57.130
Big Old titties comes in and she's like,
you know,

1749
01:42:57.131 --> 01:42:59.470
we were just trying to get pregnant.
We're really struggling.

1750
01:42:59.471 --> 01:43:02.650
So we decided to go the sperm donor route like,
Hey,
yeah,

1751
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:07.690
we got a super athlete and he's a genius.
Another guy,
he's a doctor.

1752
01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:10.120
Use Zones.
Bermed father 11 kids look at this guy.

1753
01:43:10.270 --> 01:43:15.270
Old Ass wigs were how old he is a song a week we had a broom head cheese.

1754
01:43:16.810 --> 01:43:21.180
Is that,

I don't feel lot back that back it up.

1756
01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:31.780
Back it up,
back it up.
Pause,
go full screen now you can.

1757
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:34.020
You can get there bro.
I don't think so.
Dude.

1758
01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:38.290
Lets his hair that you can do get weeks like that dude bro.

1759
01:43:38.291 --> 01:43:41.620
That's his hair.
No crazy.
He's just got whacked care

1760
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:48.970
a wig and get it all grave fucked up to 90 like why do you want a wig when you

1761
01:43:51.621 --> 01:43:52.040
just want your

1762
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:54.720
<v 2>head to be free?
It's trying to fund the office.</v>

1763
01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:59.210
He has a problem that I see dudes with fucked up here and I just want to go up

1764
01:43:59.211 --> 01:44:02.060
to them and go,
listen to me man.
There's so much freedom and shaving your head.

1765
01:44:02.090 --> 01:44:06.830
Let it go.
Get me.
I've never been happier.
Shave your head.
It's easy for you.
If I,

1766
01:44:06.890 --> 01:44:09.470
if I had hair,
I'd shave it.
If I had hair.

1767
01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:14.420
If you had the set of here like you did in your twenties you would not say that.

1768
01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:18.090
I would absolutely get a crew cut.
I get it buzzed down to stem.

1769
01:44:18.091 --> 01:44:22.190
It shaped head nubs.
Yeah.
You had some nice hair,
man.
There's some get picked.

1770
01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:27.320
Barely.
It's an illusion.
It was going quick.
Most had thin hair.
Fine.

1771
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:31.580
That's very fine.
They're not thick hairs,
you know?
But I swear,

1772
01:44:31.790 --> 01:44:35.930
even if I shaved my head the first time I shaved my head back when I was

1773
01:44:35.931 --> 01:44:39.800
fighting,
I was like,
uh,
so stupid.
I didn't want anybody to grab my hair.

1774
01:44:39.801 --> 01:44:42.800
That was my thought.
If you shave your head,
someone can't grab your hair.

1775
01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:46.850
So stupid.
But I was like 17 or 18 but I remember thinking like,
God,

1776
01:44:46.851 --> 01:44:50.200
this is so freeing.
It is nice.
Yeah.
You don't think about it.

1777
01:44:50.210 --> 01:44:53.150
You just wash and then go.
No,
there's no nothing,

1778
01:44:53.151 --> 01:44:57.140
but you got to style at squaw off.
You get a little sheet.
When I was fighting,

1779
01:44:57.141 --> 01:44:57.590
I didn't,

1780
01:44:57.590 --> 01:45:00.050
when I was fighting I shave it cause I remember I was getting ready for a

1781
01:45:00.051 --> 01:45:03.140
Jujitsu tournament and I was fixing my hair in the mirror and I was like,

1782
01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.650
what the fuck man,
how's this going to help?
I shaved it the next night.

1783
01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:10.260
That's good mood.
And I did that for my entire career until I retired.

1784
01:45:10.261 --> 01:45:14.210
And I'm like,
it's time to get my sex.
Yeah.
Whoo.
I agree with the shit out.
Ooh.

1785
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:15.330
Yeah.
I can't pay you.

1786
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:18.350
You don't want to have cauliflower ears and a shaved head like Bravo is not

1787
01:45:18.351 --> 01:45:22.920
hiring that guy.
May Bro.
Relax.
So Bravo hired you and uh,

1788
01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.200
are you liking it over there?
I do.
Like,
is that like working for Bravo?
I know.

1789
01:45:27.201 --> 01:45:30.540
I thought you were gonna make fun of me when they,
when uh,
g.
So Gerald Khan,

1790
01:45:30.541 --> 01:45:32.720
who's on the show with me,
he came,
he sold,
one of my sets,

1791
01:45:32.721 --> 01:45:35.720
came in the back and you and Brian were back then I was like compact to get

1792
01:45:35.721 --> 01:45:39.440
roasted by Rogan and fucking Cowen and you guys were so nice about it.

1793
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:42.290
Why would I make fun of it?
So I thought it's a good gig.
It's a great gig.

1794
01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:45.400
I perfect free personalities,
make fun of shit original.

1795
01:45:45.450 --> 01:45:48.410
I didn't think it was a good Gig,
you know?
Um,
the guy who does,

1796
01:45:48.470 --> 01:45:51.140
or one of the producers who does below the belt on showtime,

1797
01:45:51.141 --> 01:45:54.770
Michael Davies at Mc row,
I was talking with him.
He goes,
Howard,

1798
01:45:54.810 --> 01:45:57.710
we're doing this a bravo show with Andy Cohen.
And he goes,

1799
01:45:57.711 --> 01:45:59.780
you watch bravo good all the time.
He has no,

1800
01:45:59.781 --> 01:46:03.230
you don't mean literally all the time.
Gimme gimme a question.
Name a show.

1801
01:46:03.231 --> 01:46:05.810
And he's like,
you really do it.
He goes,
do,
we're putting the show together,

1802
01:46:05.811 --> 01:46:09.300
you should audition for it.
And I was like,
I felt weird about it.
I talked to,

1803
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:12.800
to my age and I'm like,
I don't know if that's for me,
man.
And he's just audition,

1804
01:46:12.801 --> 01:46:13.634
see what happens.

1805
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:17.750
But then I went in there and did a chemistry test with Jl O'connell.

1806
01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:21.860
He's hilarious.
Oh,
Jerry O'Connell.
He came backstage.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1807
01:46:21.861 --> 01:46:23.270
See I didn't put the two together.

1808
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:26.150
I didn't realize that he was backstage cause he was doing that thing.

1809
01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:30.170
Cherries was a very nice guy.
He's not,
and he's funny as hell.
And I thought,

1810
01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.830
all right,
this won't be too bad.
Like I know my real housewives,
but I was like,

1811
01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:36.840
how many of those shows do you watch?
Uh,

1812
01:46:36.940 --> 01:46:40.310
I watch real housewives of Orange County,
married the medicine,
Atlanta,

1813
01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:44.420
New York below deck.
My wife,
uh,
she,

1814
01:46:44.510 --> 01:46:48.960
she's been DVR and keeping up with the Kardashians and uh,

1815
01:46:49.110 --> 01:46:50.010
it was on the,

1816
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:53.520
<v 0>you know how when you turn on the TV,
it's already recording,
so it's playing.</v>

1817
01:46:53.730 --> 01:46:58.590
So I sat there and as the show was on,
my jaw got more and more slack.
Look,

1818
01:46:58.591 --> 01:47:02.090
those look.
Yeah,
it's pretty crazy.
Well,

1819
01:47:02.150 --> 01:47:05.870
eyelids get heavy and I just got,
she's got,

1820
01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:10.110
I'll send you out a fake ass
made me Tom.

1821
01:47:11.700 --> 01:47:16.030
My brain started drying out.
He's like changed a quick no,
you got to run.

1822
01:47:16.140 --> 01:47:20.220
I had to put on a deal de Grasse Tyson shot.
I've got to run quick on cosmos.

1823
01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:23.420
I think I like it for me because um,
you know,

1824
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:26.780
fighting what I do when I cover fighting when I was playing,
it's so serious,
man.

1825
01:47:26.781 --> 01:47:28.800
That's how I got into that stuff.
I was like,
dude,

1826
01:47:28.801 --> 01:47:31.410
I just got done sparring Shane car one,

1827
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:34.010
let me go home and eat a bag of Twizzlers and watch real housewives,

1828
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:36.750
orange town and silliness fricking.
Here we are.

1829
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:40.260
Sometimes it's fun when those bitches go off on each other.
They're so mean.

1830
01:47:40.410 --> 01:47:40.771
And you know,

1831
01:47:40.771 --> 01:47:44.760
the thing is like when the get them on camera and then they know they're on

1832
01:47:44.761 --> 01:47:48.390
camera so they try to be extra mean on camera.
Oh Dude.
Oh yeah.

1833
01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:51.660
They know exactly what they can just keeping it real.
I'm just being real bitch.

1834
01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:54.510
It'd be a real country.
I know.

1835
01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:58.560
It's cool seeing Jarrod Kahn who's been in the industry forever,

1836
01:47:58.590 --> 01:48:02.070
but then Andy Cohen who's a producer on it and then we had Kelly rip on the
show.

1837
01:48:02.110 --> 01:48:03.810
You just run in these like entertainment monsters,

1838
01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:07.140
like to see the way they work and like they're,
they're there for a reason.

1839
01:48:07.141 --> 01:48:10.830
Like you see Kelly rip unhealthy fast.
She is.
And like how she was professional.

1840
01:48:10.831 --> 01:48:14.160
She is,
she's like,
like she's a monster or Andy Cohen and puts all this together.

1841
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:17.640
I go,
he's a monster and she'd still doing that show with Michael's tray hand.

1842
01:48:18.030 --> 01:48:20.460
She does it now with um,

1843
01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:24.490
Brian see Chris the same show.
Same show.

1844
01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.970
It's called Kelly and Ryan dray hand retired.

1845
01:48:27.090 --> 01:48:30.900
He went to good morning America and there was like a little bit of beef.

1846
01:48:30.901 --> 01:48:33.360
I don't know exactly why to have her and him.
She was like,

1847
01:48:33.361 --> 01:48:34.260
can't believe you're leaving.

1848
01:48:34.320 --> 01:48:37.590
And there's some weird beef I guess when I first gave her the beef.

1849
01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:42.510
I don't think so.
You might have though.
I bet he has a

1850
01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.400
big old fella.
Great football player too.

1851
01:48:48.220 --> 01:48:51.450
It seems like a real friendly guy.
Well to friendliness.

1852
01:48:52.670 --> 01:48:56.700
A little too good on the mic.
She charismatic dude.
He's amazing.

1853
01:48:56.701 --> 01:49:00.570
He made no attempt to fix that gap in his teeth.
Zero.
Kind of like that.
Me Too.

1854
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:04.760
I saw Matt running one time.
He's zoomed up.
He fell.

1855
01:49:04.770 --> 01:49:09.750
He's a free fastest shit.
Yeah,
he's a super athlete.

1856
01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.710
You know what's amazing that a guy that's been playing that much football has

1857
01:49:13.711 --> 01:49:16.260
needs.
Like how's his niece to work?
I agree.

1858
01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:19.200
It's very strange what's going on there.
I'd like to get an Mri,

1859
01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.710
maybe got injected with some frickin stem cells and all the same things

1860
01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:28.200
do.
They fixed me the fuck up man and I still need to do,

1861
01:49:28.230 --> 01:49:29.340
I keep saying I'm going to do it.

1862
01:49:29.370 --> 01:49:33.030
My fucking right shoulder was so jacked and now it has,

1863
01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:36.960
it's like I don't have a problem with it at all.
There's nothing wrong with it.

1864
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:40.230
Your whole body feels better.
Well they do it intravenously.

1865
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.780
And when you did do it intravenously,

1866
01:49:41.810 --> 01:49:45.240
like takes care of little things and it takes care of things over a course of

1867
01:49:45.241 --> 01:49:49.810
like a few months like it like over one and two.

1868
01:49:49.811 --> 01:49:50.471
And by the way,

1869
01:49:50.471 --> 01:49:55.120
what I had done here in America is nothing in compared to what doctor Neil

1870
01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:58.540
Riordan is doing down in Panama with Tj Dillashaw went down there and that's why

1871
01:49:58.541 --> 01:50:02.860
Tj thanked him when he beat Cody and he won the title or defend the title gets

1872
01:50:02.861 --> 01:50:07.660
Cody.
And uh,
that's why Mel Gibson was on talking with Neil Riordan.

1873
01:50:07.730 --> 01:50:12.190
Everyone swears.
But Dude,
Mel Gibson's dad was 92 on death's door,
couldn't walk.

1874
01:50:12.430 --> 01:50:16.840
Now he's a hundred and walking around cat dam.
Yeah,
it's just,

1875
01:50:16.870 --> 01:50:20.760
they go there every few months,
every few months get jolted.
But what you do is,

1876
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:25.210
it's not as good,
but it's similar.
Yeah.
Well,
they do it in America.
It's not,

1877
01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:29.710
it's not as extreme,
you know,
and they're doing tests on it.
It's called,

1878
01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.100
they're called exosomes.
Exosomes.

1879
01:50:32.140 --> 01:50:35.980
They used to think it was stem cells that were doing all the regenerative work,

1880
01:50:35.981 --> 01:50:38.860
but now they think that stem cells are releasing exosomes.

1881
01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:44.200
So now they just take exosomes and they put exosomes with platelet rich plasma

1882
01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:47.180
and they inject them directly into injuries and they've having,

1883
01:50:47.210 --> 01:50:51.190
they're having tremendous results to have tremendous results.
Dude,

1884
01:50:51.191 --> 01:50:55.930
I had a fucking full length rotator cuff take.
Huge problem gone.

1885
01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:59.770
I needed from her neck.
I need familiar cuff tear is gone.

1886
01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:03.430
It doesn't exist anymore.
I got a new MRI.
There's no more tear.

1887
01:51:03.580 --> 01:51:07.330
That's fucking magic.
That's the magic.
You should have to have surgery.
Yes,

1888
01:51:07.331 --> 01:51:09.910
I was gonna.
I was,
I was,
I was trying to put it off.

1889
01:51:10.090 --> 01:51:11.620
That's what I was trying to do.
I was like,

1890
01:51:11.621 --> 01:51:14.320
eventually I'm going to have to have surgery now.
I'm like,
I don't need surgery.

1891
01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:16.420
I just need it from my neck.
What's going on with your neck?

1892
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:17.760
It got injured when uh,

1893
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:20.500
during the Travis Browne camp and then in my last fight when,

1894
01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:23.240
which is four years ago,
which is crazy thing about for long,

1895
01:51:23.290 --> 01:51:26.410
four years ago when I went to go take down Travis,
all his weight,

1896
01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:28.960
he sprawled and landed on my neck.
And if you look at the tape,

1897
01:51:29.050 --> 01:51:31.660
my neck folds like this with his hips on top of me.

1898
01:51:31.930 --> 01:51:36.130
I shared this in my neck and ever since then it's been fucking,

1899
01:51:36.131 --> 01:51:41.020
just not great.
Did you ever get an Mri?
I got one a while ago and there's,

1900
01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:45.020
there's one of the,
what do you call them?
One of the things are dead.
One of the,

1901
01:51:45.021 --> 01:51:49.540
one of your disks.
This is like black.
Black.
Yeah.
I guess one of the discs,

1902
01:51:49.570 --> 01:51:53.800
there's an issue with the one that disk,
Ooh,
I know black.
Yeah.
What's that about?

1903
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:57.130
I don't know.
They don't know what that means.
They did.
This was a while ago.

1904
01:51:57.170 --> 01:52:00.070
I should do it again.
That was right after the funders should do it again.

1905
01:52:00.071 --> 01:52:02.930
After the podcast.
We'll talk cause a,
I'll send you to a,

1906
01:52:03.010 --> 01:52:06.700
my doctor I just said and Kenny Florian down there.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
I could use it.

1907
01:52:07.210 --> 01:52:09.870
Yeah,
they're doing well.
The one of the things they do for dis that dude,

1908
01:52:09.871 --> 01:52:12.790
they do stem cells as well,
but they also do something called Regina King.

1909
01:52:12.790 --> 01:52:15.520
That's the thing that Coby Bryan and Peyton Manning,

1910
01:52:15.521 --> 01:52:18.160
they were going to Germany to get done and now they do it in America.

1911
01:52:19.060 --> 01:52:20.620
They've been doing in America for quite a while now.

1912
01:52:20.621 --> 01:52:24.730
That's what fixed my neck when I had a bulging discs in my neck and my hand is

1913
01:52:24.731 --> 01:52:27.760
going numb.
Regena cane fix me and need you saw I sneak yet.

1914
01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.010
I just got to make it a priority.
Yeah.
Just I'm so,

1915
01:52:30.011 --> 01:52:32.980
I've been so busy I haven't been able to stop.
It's nice though.
Yeah.

1916
01:52:33.190 --> 01:52:34.750
Look at you out there hustling.
Hustling.

1917
01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.060
A little Birdie told me you got to show time special coming out.

1918
01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:39.700
Got a comedy special coming on January.
Shit.

1919
01:52:39.730 --> 01:52:43.570
They get a film in January or it's going to come out and just filming it.

1920
01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:46.400
The [inaudible] theater in San Diego.
Oh

1921
01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.470
<v 2>Shit.
What day?
Big Boy right now.</v>

1922
01:52:48.710 --> 01:52:52.820
I think it's on the 27th.
How many uh,

1923
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:55.940
shows you filming too.
Nice.
That's good.

1924
01:52:55.970 --> 01:52:59.170
I know for his ideal it's ideal to two's good?
Yup.

1925
01:52:59.171 --> 01:53:03.440
It's that that Saturday is the 20 or no,
that's a 26.
26th you in town.

1926
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:08.750
So I am now Shab special a you be special.

1927
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:15.260
I am son.
Big Boy moves.
Yeah.
Alright,
moving right.
San Diego there.

1928
01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:17.300
Okay.
Locations.
San Diego.

1929
01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:19.183
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1930
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:24.210
<v 2>Yeah.
Big Boy moves,
man.
Do you feel weird about filming something you,</v>

1931
01:53:24.220 --> 01:53:28.060
you,
you feel pumped about that super pumped about it?
I,
uh,

1932
01:53:28.090 --> 01:53:31.680
super pumped but super excited about it.
I know the product,
the qualities,

1933
01:53:31.690 --> 01:53:36.040
you'd be great.
I guess for me it's more of like,
like I told you,

1934
01:53:36.041 --> 01:53:38.530
you're the first person I told,
but I,
uh,

1935
01:53:38.590 --> 01:53:41.680
like I wouldn't go to the comedy store and like be like,
Yo,
what's up dude?

1936
01:53:41.681 --> 01:53:43.330
Doing economy,
you know,
like I just,

1937
01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:46.420
I feel weird around other comics because I feel like they're gonna judge me.

1938
01:53:46.421 --> 01:53:50.200
Like,
what the fuck?
You know,
it's not that listen to them,
I just don't,

1939
01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:54.580
I feel like if maybe there's comics who've been doing it for 10 years and they

1940
01:53:54.581 --> 01:53:57.160
have no big time special or,
you know,
it's like,

1941
01:53:57.610 --> 01:54:00.370
I don't want them to hold resentment toward not that can deal with any of that,

1942
01:54:00.371 --> 01:54:02.770
but that's why I don't share it with everyone.
Well,

1943
01:54:02.771 --> 01:54:06.010
I tell comics the difference between you and them is it,

1944
01:54:06.011 --> 01:54:10.660
you have a professional athlete's work ethic and comics have very little work

1945
01:54:10.661 --> 01:54:14.860
ethic.
Yeah.
They're lazy as fuck.
That's the number one problem.
If you'd say,

1946
01:54:14.861 --> 01:54:18.040
what's the number one problem with comics jerking off in front of women?

1947
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:20.170
Number two,
lazy.

1948
01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:25.180
And I'd say number three just self sabotage like that.

1949
01:54:25.181 --> 01:54:28.960
A lot of comics I see doing the same material over and over.
I'm like,
well that,

1950
01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:32.830
listen Meagan,
a special on showtime doesn't take anything away from you.

1951
01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:36.980
It's good level playing field.
They give out a ton.
Just because,
uh,

1952
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:40.900
Chris Delea got a special on Netflix doesn't mean they took it away from you.

1953
01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:43.120
Right?
There's room for everybody.

1954
01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:46.570
There's either you're just not funny or you're not putting in the work.

1955
01:54:46.630 --> 01:54:51.010
I have nothing to do with it or,
yeah,
I mean guys don't like to edit either.

1956
01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:51.851
That's another problem.

1957
01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:55.240
They don't like to chop their things down and boil them and make them better.

1958
01:54:55.570 --> 01:54:56.800
You know,
they have a bit,
they,

1959
01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:59.380
they say it a certain way and they like to say it that way.
Forever.

1960
01:55:00.100 --> 01:55:04.480
Can't do that.
No.
Comedy is a living thing.
It's like a living art form.

1961
01:55:04.481 --> 01:55:06.220
It's constantly changing and evolving.

1962
01:55:06.221 --> 01:55:09.030
Like I had a friend come to see me and then they came to see me for months and

1963
01:55:09.031 --> 01:55:11.200
be like,
dude,
that fucking bit is totally different.
I'm like,
yeah,

1964
01:55:11.201 --> 01:55:14.650
you got to tweak it.
Yep.
Got It.
Always be tweaking.
I think don't,

1965
01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:18.190
the only way for me to tweak is doing on stage.
I can,
I ride it out different,

1966
01:55:18.210 --> 01:55:22.420
but I only find it on state 100% so I have to do those full weekends.
Thursday,

1967
01:55:22.421 --> 01:55:26.460
Friday,
Saturday.
That's where it's at.
Two,
two,
two,
two and just roll.
Yeah.

1968
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:30.040
I find that even with theaters when I'm doing two theaters at night,

1969
01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:33.850
I get more done than just one like one on one of the things about these big

1970
01:55:33.851 --> 01:55:37.210
places,
you just doing one show.
Yeah,
you're better off.
You're really better off.

1971
01:55:37.211 --> 01:55:41.500
Like one of the things I'm looking forward to is somewhere around December I'm

1972
01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:43.980
going to start booking clubs and I'm going to,
you

1973
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.600
<v 0>know,
I'll do like Oxnard.
I'll do like levity live in Oxnard.</v>

1974
01:55:48.601 --> 01:55:51.630
I'll do like the comedy works in Denver lives.
Yeah.

1975
01:55:51.631 --> 01:55:55.780
I'll do some s maybe even the punchline.
San Francisco,
even smart Sacramento.

1976
01:55:55.781 --> 01:55:59.820
You mean?
Uh,
San Francisco too.
Is there a pendulum?
Isn't there punch?

1977
01:55:59.830 --> 01:56:02.430
I'm doing punchline in Sacramento and that's great too.

1978
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:06.500
That's a great little Gig,
but it's near a lot of cracked out people.
I,

1979
01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:10.230
it's a been there.
I've been there before.
Men,
that parking lot sketch,

1980
01:56:10.260 --> 01:56:13.530
I stay far away.
Drive me.
Yeah,
that parking lot.

1981
01:56:13.540 --> 01:56:17.070
Sketch sketchy.
Yeah.
Red Van.
I almost got killed.

1982
01:56:17.180 --> 01:56:22.080
She in the hotel,
she says subscribed.
I don't stay at the normal.
Yeah,

1983
01:56:22.081 --> 01:56:24.210
the parking lot.
Sketchy.
But the club's awesome.

1984
01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.410
So you can start doing much more clubs.
That's the deal you do.
You know,

1985
01:56:28.411 --> 01:56:31.780
you have to have those four set weekends,
five set weekends where he just,

1986
01:56:32.250 --> 01:56:32.431
you know,

1987
01:56:32.431 --> 01:56:35.700
like you'll have a bit that you come in on Thursday and then by the time

1988
01:56:35.701 --> 01:56:39.720
Saturday rolls around,
that bit's alive.
It's cracking.
Yup.
You know,

1989
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:43.080
but it's also one of the great things about being able to work so much in La.

1990
01:56:43.380 --> 01:56:47.670
Like Thursday night I did four sets.
A Tuesday night or three sets.
No,

1991
01:56:47.671 --> 01:56:50.850
I did three of the store and one the Improv.
Jesus.
Yeah.

1992
01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:52.500
I did two main room shows.

1993
01:56:52.501 --> 01:56:56.340
I had my show in the main room I did were stone show in the main room and then I

1994
01:56:56.341 --> 01:57:00.540
did a the or,
and then before that I did a show at the Improv.

1995
01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:03.420
I liked the Improv.
Improv is not bad man.
You know,

1996
01:57:03.421 --> 01:57:05.930
now that they pushed that fucking piano keys,

1997
01:57:06.090 --> 01:57:08.100
the way Jesus stepped piano was stupid.

1998
01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.850
Like how many people use that fucking piano that you're blocking?
Half the stage.

1999
01:57:11.851 --> 01:57:13.620
Just Brian Killen does he use it?

2000
01:57:13.690 --> 01:57:15.990
He would get on their neck like he's playing the piano was hilarious,

2001
01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:20.340
but not anymore.
Brian.
They got rid of it.
Sorry Brian.
So I'd be,
yeah,

2002
01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:23.580
I mean who would use it?
Chris Robinson.
Yeah,
that's it.

2003
01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:29.010
That's it.
It's just the old school thing to do.
Well,
yeah,
it's like,

2004
01:57:29.011 --> 01:57:33.090
I think it's like a witty thing to have around like how many people will have a

2005
01:57:33.091 --> 01:57:36.270
piano in their house actually play the piano.
What a Dick move.

2006
01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:39.770
Have Piano in your house.
Especially if you have the back part.
Opal.

2007
01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:43.950
I know like your Mozart or some shit.
Like you know,
fucking run a whole,

2008
01:57:46.590 --> 01:57:48.240
I wish I could play the piano.
Be honest with you.

2009
01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:51.230
I'd have people over and play it.
Would you interrupt the Superbowl?

2010
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:54.030
Fucking pause.
We're to take a moment and I'm going to fucking,

2011
01:57:54.031 --> 01:57:58.950
I will now call him champ though to put your pizza down.
Yeah.

2012
01:57:58.951 --> 01:58:01.560
We're going to drink white wine and I'm going to play the piano.

2013
01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:03.600
Just just take move ever.

2014
01:58:03.870 --> 01:58:05.820
Do you ever think you'd get to the point where you're so pretentious,

2015
01:58:05.821 --> 01:58:10.680
you're willing to go to a musical,
a musical opera?
I'll go to some musicals,

2016
01:58:10.681 --> 01:58:14.640
Bro,
and I went to Hamilton by myself in New York like a psycho.

2017
01:58:14.690 --> 01:58:18.840
Why'd you and I left her like,
why'd you do that?

2018
01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:23.540
I like plays and theater.
I went to see Annie at the Hollywood bowl.
Is it good?

2019
01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:26.310
Nope.
You took your kids?
Yup.
Yeah.
It wasn't good.

2020
01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:29.310
You don't like that stuff though?
Nope.
See I like that stuff.

2021
01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:33.990
I was thinking about all sorts of other things going over my act while it was

2022
01:58:33.991 --> 01:58:37.320
happening,
I couldn't enjoy it.
I was so bored.
I know the story.

2023
01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:40.620
That's part of the problem that it's like going to see King Kong,
Hey,

2024
01:58:40.621 --> 01:58:42.100
guess King Kong dies the

2025
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:46.540
<v 2>end.
You Fuck Spiderman two over.
Yeah,
I mean,
yeah,
we know the story.
Yeah,</v>

2026
01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:48.850
Spiderman is going to live.
He's going to become Spiderman.

2027
01:58:49.060 --> 01:58:52.120
I mean maybe that's impossible.
Twists and turns if they're going to Redo it,

2028
01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:55.840
but at the end of the day,
King Kong dies.
True.
And Annie,

2029
01:58:55.841 --> 01:58:59.560
they didn't change at a God damn word where your kids loving it or they were

2030
01:58:59.561 --> 01:59:03.850
like,
no,
there should a board too.
That's a problem.
But you know,
it's a fun what?

2031
01:59:03.851 --> 01:59:07.390
Well,
this might be too.
I don't,
how old are your kids?
Eight and 10.

2032
01:59:07.391 --> 01:59:09.370
The little nightmare before Christmas live there.

2033
01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:12.070
We've Sandy Elfman gums that she'd done that dope.

2034
01:59:12.130 --> 01:59:15.160
That was good because the last years have grown man.
They also play,

2035
01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:18.940
they have music,
but they also play the movie.
But they have the actual character,

2036
01:59:19.570 --> 01:59:23.140
the girl,
the lady from home alone.
The mom.
Yeah,
she's the voice.

2037
01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:27.510
Danny Elfman.
Danny Elfman has that big Dick Energy,
doesn't,

2038
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:31.060
he just rolls up there like you don't give a fuck.
And he's just had Scientology.

2039
01:59:31.061 --> 01:59:34.690
Scientology.
Yeah.
Let's get that Tom Cruise energy.
Wow,
bro.

2040
01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:38.890
That Wilson word energy.
It does.
Where they ship energy,
Bro.

2041
01:59:41.010 --> 01:59:45.040
That's
a new one.
It doesn't seem to bother them.

2042
01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:49.120
That's hilarious.
That's a good show though.
But I went to Hamilton.
I had no idea.

2043
01:59:49.121 --> 01:59:51.160
I was just,
I was there for a night of shooting that Bravo's show.

2044
01:59:51.161 --> 01:59:55.180
I'm all by myself when he got a nice proper meal.
So you did this recent one.

2045
01:59:55.570 --> 01:59:58.900
It's like three weeks ago.
Dude.
She got a proper meal by yourself all by myself.

2046
01:59:58.901 --> 02:00:02.890
Got The prime rib.
Just soared the prime rib.
Very Kido ate by myself.

2047
02:00:02.920 --> 02:00:04.900
Expensive little mail,
like whatever.

2048
02:00:04.930 --> 02:00:09.930
See Ya went online but a not a cheap ticket to Hamilton sat there and was like,

2049
02:00:10.331 --> 02:00:13.000
Yo,
this is cool.
[inaudible] decided to do this because you're on Bravo.

2050
02:00:13.001 --> 02:00:16.180
Let me do some other gay things,
man.
Just trying to live bro.

2051
02:00:16.210 --> 02:00:19.810
Trying to embrace the New York vibe.
Broadway live.
Okay.

2052
02:00:19.811 --> 02:00:23.160
Everyone's been talking about Hamilton forever.
Are they really?
I mean,

2053
02:00:23.161 --> 02:00:26.500
talking to the Ted talk of the town is the first time I been winning in front of

2054
02:00:26.501 --> 02:00:31.420
me has ever talked about
literally maybe my circles,
Bro.

2055
02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:35.420
I just feel like it was a big deal.
So I get there,
right?
And I'm like,
all right,

2056
02:00:35.421 --> 02:00:38.500
this could be cool.
And uh,
they wrap the entire time.

2057
02:00:38.501 --> 02:00:42.580
And so an hour and a half goes by.
I'm like,
oh,
that was fun and we go to get up.

2058
02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:45.480
I'm like,
well that was,
that was good.
And the guy's like,
that's intermission.

2059
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:49.840
There's another hour and a half.
I'm like,
no fucking way.
So I thought,

2060
02:00:49.841 --> 02:00:51.400
you know what?
Let's not waste money.

2061
02:00:51.401 --> 02:00:54.310
I don't want to disrespect the town and let's just sit down.
So I sat down,

2062
02:00:54.640 --> 02:00:57.370
started get back up,
this fat do started to sing and went,
you know what,

2063
02:00:57.371 --> 02:00:58.300
I'm fucking out of here.

2064
02:00:58.330 --> 02:01:00.640
And I walked out and has something to hear the guy working goes,

2065
02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:03.810
he knew me cause Shab who leaves early?
Who?

2066
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:07.660
Hampton earlier when I do and just fucking got out.
It's like,
dude,
I can't do it,

2067
02:01:07.661 --> 02:01:12.130
man.
When I was 18 years old,
I was dating this girl and she took me to see cats.

2068
02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:16.300
That's an old school one.
Yeah.
It's not your thing.

2069
02:01:16.690 --> 02:01:20.710
It was a murderous assault on my attention.
They're tough.

2070
02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:24.760
They're crawling around like I'm a cat.
Ah,
ah,

2071
02:01:25.090 --> 02:01:28.930
ah.
Ah.
It is the worst piece of shit.

2072
02:01:29.420 --> 02:01:32.650
I couldn't believe how bad it had a great thing.
He goes,

2073
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:36.940
can we stop pretending you're in the fucking,
it's the Thomas Jefferson.
He goes,

2074
02:01:36.941 --> 02:01:40.160
what the fuck is this?
Why are you guys acting like you're in the middle

2075
02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:42.830
<v 0>of a fucking war zone?
You're on a fucking stage.</v>

2076
02:01:42.831 --> 02:01:46.630
I was laughing so hard because that's his background.
Cats.
No.

2077
02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:50.810
In a war zone or hammer.
No,
no.
Hamilton.
All these.
Look at this.
Look how bad.

2078
02:01:50.811 --> 02:01:52.430
This is.
Rare.
I'm a cat.

2079
02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:57.800
She must have been the hottest girl ever to get you to go to this thing.
She was,

2080
02:01:57.801 --> 02:02:01.580
hey,
I'll put,
I'll put up with some shit.
Yeah.
Well,

2081
02:02:01.581 --> 02:02:05.540
I mean she was chats in a dick too.
We were both 18 and we're both like,

2082
02:02:05.541 --> 02:02:08.730
maybe this is what adults do.
Yeah.
Cool.
Dude,
this was good.

2083
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:11.890
Pretend to be adults and then you were bored.
It was she board of,

2084
02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:16.700
she all into it was just like,
sorry,
my bad.
I mean,
she had never been before.

2085
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:20.950
It was one of those things.
You know,
you,
you hear like look,
go,
look,
we'll,
we'll,

2086
02:02:20.951 --> 02:02:25.170
we're going on a date.
Let's go to a musical.
Okay.
Yeah,
let's go see Cassie.

2087
02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:27.650
I'm not,
I've never been there.
I won't ride it out on and be like,
oh,

2088
02:02:27.651 --> 02:02:31.100
let's just get through this.
Even if a movie,
a movie,
if it's boring,
I'm out,

2089
02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:34.800
I found,

Good for you.
See them.
You gotta be able to do that.
God,

2090
02:02:34.801 --> 02:02:38.270
it just pull the tree like this sucks.
Right?
Torture in you the worst.

2091
02:02:39.020 --> 02:02:41.090
The absolute worst one.
Last time you started good movie.

2092
02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:46.840
What's the last good movie you've seen?
God with the Kiddo.

2093
02:02:46.850 --> 02:02:49.040
It's stuffed to go to the movies.
I like the little feet.

2094
02:02:49.041 --> 02:02:52.390
You gotta to take your kid to sleep this week.
Have you seen it?
No.
I want us.

2095
02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:54.020
Good.
Hell yeah.
Lebron James,
isn't it?

2096
02:02:55.610 --> 02:02:57.080
That's a lot of people say that's the first sign.

2097
02:02:57.081 --> 02:03:00.360
They knew that he was gonna go to the Lakers for sure.
What?
He's going to movies.

2098
02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:04.040
He's Hollywood.
He's going Hollywood.
I,

2099
02:03:04.041 --> 02:03:06.470
I've been watching a bunch of shows on like Netflix.

2100
02:03:06.471 --> 02:03:10.490
I kept seeing sinner or Jessica Biel.
No,
it's amazing.
Really good.

2101
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:11.990
She should have won that Goddamn Emmy.

2102
02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:15.410
What does that an encore show or something like there's on USA.

2103
02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:18.950
It was on USA and they brought over to Netflix.
That shit.
Yeah,

2104
02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.200
it's on Netflix and it is straight up.
It's intense.
The first episode,

2105
02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:27.040
like what the fuck?
Yeah.
That's a damn good.
Hmm.

2106
02:03:28.370 --> 02:03:32.690
I haven't seen a good movie in a long time.
You Watch Ozark?
No,
I watch first one.

2107
02:03:32.691 --> 02:03:37.580
Couldn't get into it.
People I know.
I know.
People need to what?
I know what,

2108
02:03:38.330 --> 02:03:41.810
what I know Bro.
People love it.
They're on season two,
right?
I'm on season two,

2109
02:03:41.811 --> 02:03:45.980
episode nine and he loves it.
Oh.
If I get a show I like,

2110
02:03:45.981 --> 02:03:49.490
I will just fucking power through that thing.
It's a good show,
man.

2111
02:03:49.491 --> 02:03:51.680
I'm telling you.
Give it a chance.
Yeah.
You got to get on it.

2112
02:03:51.750 --> 02:03:55.550
It keeps getting pissed.
Second person told me no,
it's fucking good.

2113
02:03:55.610 --> 02:03:58.940
What about strange times or stranger things?
Stranger things,

2114
02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:02.430
strange stranger things.
Have you seen that?
You've seen that,
right?
Yeah,

2115
02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:05.180
it's good.
It's amazing.
They're doing season three now.

2116
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:08.930
This is the best time ever to be a lazy fuck and just sit in front of the TV.

2117
02:04:09.290 --> 02:04:12.290
There's more sugar content and it sounded like the contents going away.

2118
02:04:12.291 --> 02:04:15.380
That's what's really crazy,
dude.
I'd laugh at shows like I'll,

2119
02:04:15.530 --> 02:04:17.780
I'll watch good more and make or something in the morning.
It's been when,

2120
02:04:17.890 --> 02:04:21.710
when commercials hit,
I laugh.
I'm like,
you silly fucked as chasse channel.

2121
02:04:21.740 --> 02:04:22.670
What is like,
what are you doing?

2122
02:04:22.671 --> 02:04:26.540
I'm just gonna go to something else I'm not seeing with this radio.
I know.

2123
02:04:26.541 --> 02:04:31.040
It's so old school commercials.
Yeah.
Interrupting them.

2124
02:04:31.070 --> 02:04:33.830
I get mad when people do commercials in the middle of the podcasts.

2125
02:04:33.890 --> 02:04:35.570
Do you do commercials in the middle of Your podcast?
We do.

2126
02:04:35.690 --> 02:04:38.040
I do them all up front.
That's right.
It,
I'm all up

2127
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.560
<v 2>front.
That's how you do it.
I mean offset.
I've learned from you.
Yeah.</v>

2128
02:04:40.620 --> 02:04:42.900
Fuck all that interrupting.
Yeah.

2129
02:04:42.901 --> 02:04:46.140
I think people get upset and they'd rather not buy.

2130
02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:48.930
I think if people were inclined they like,
you know a Chubb,

2131
02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:53.510
I'll try the Squarespace shit out because you advertise it in front of your pod.

2132
02:04:53.840 --> 02:04:56.790
Fuck up bro.
Yeah.
We've had some I'm looking at,

2133
02:04:56.791 --> 02:05:00.600
we've had some that asked for mid roll,
but it's very rare you just all up,

2134
02:05:00.660 --> 02:05:04.530
everything's up front.
Yeah.
Everything's a way to do it.
Everything.

2135
02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:06.180
Even with FM radio,

2136
02:05:06.181 --> 02:05:09.300
like I'd go into certain cities and I just had this conversation with my age.

2137
02:05:09.301 --> 02:05:11.190
I'm like,
dude,
I'm not doing press anymore.
Yeah.

2138
02:05:11.210 --> 02:05:14.580
Not doing press cause all sorts of different animal for me because these big

2139
02:05:14.581 --> 02:05:19.140
sport FM radio station and bring me on comic writer could be break it down like

2140
02:05:19.230 --> 02:05:23.600
I got my own show bitch trying to showtime sternum below the belt,
my podcast,

2141
02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:26.140
listen to that.
That me breakdown Conor,

2142
02:05:26.150 --> 02:05:29.520
Khabib not selling any comedy tickets going to talk about you want to talk about

2143
02:05:29.521 --> 02:05:31.350
just life.
I'm down.

2144
02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:34.850
You want me to break down the fucking Broncos game or it could be common.

2145
02:05:34.851 --> 02:05:38.220
It's not happening.
Well.
It's also a problem with if you're lucky,

2146
02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:40.440
your personality goes well with them,

2147
02:05:40.620 --> 02:05:45.030
but I've had many in during my days of doing the road and doing radio,

2148
02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:50.170
I've had many times where I just did not vibe with the person who was the DJ and

2149
02:05:50.171 --> 02:05:53.490
it all a real issue and then you come off as a dick,

2150
02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:55.740
like some things I'd be like,
no,
I don't want to talk about that.

2151
02:05:55.770 --> 02:05:58.760
Like y'all talking about,
no,
I don't talk about an ex girlfriend.
He want talk.

2152
02:05:58.761 --> 02:06:01.650
My next girlfriend like we didn't doing man.
Like what are you doing?

2153
02:06:01.651 --> 02:06:05.500
Like you just try to make things controversial because you're not interesting
or,

2154
02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:09.330
or what would make him comfortable?
Oh Dude,
you and Dana White.

2155
02:06:09.331 --> 02:06:12.870
What's the deal there?
I'm like,
no deal.
What do you mean?
What do you want?

2156
02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:16.890
How am I gonna make this and sell Cami tickets?
Right.
How's that going to work,

2157
02:06:16.891 --> 02:06:20.700
dude?
Wow.
It's just they're not that good.
No radio.

2158
02:06:20.770 --> 02:06:22.290
There's a lot of people out there doing it.

2159
02:06:22.291 --> 02:06:26.340
They're just not that good at I shop when I was doing it when I was doing radio,

2160
02:06:26.341 --> 02:06:29.440
I'd be like,
you're just not an interesting person.
No,
you're,

2161
02:06:29.530 --> 02:06:34.530
you're like noise in between people that are talking that are interesting to

2162
02:06:34.621 --> 02:06:39.420
your interviewing in between music and you have a giant ego.
Yup.
Huge.

2163
02:06:39.421 --> 02:06:42.720
They have to pick a seat goes I,
yeah.
And also like,

2164
02:06:42.721 --> 02:06:46.860
it's so old school to move tickets.
It just,
it doesn't make sense to me.
Well,

2165
02:06:46.861 --> 02:06:51.360
you know,
it's more old school and more gross.
Those morning TV shows.

2166
02:06:51.600 --> 02:06:56.460
Good Morning Dallas.
We're here with Brendan Shaw from the Ufo

2167
02:06:58.390 --> 02:07:02.540
to talk about knuckle fighting or something.
What did through,

2168
02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:06.900
I did one in Spokane and this is the last letter that I was like,
oh,
I'm out.

2169
02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:10.200
There's no more.
I'm never doing this again.
There's no more.
Ah,

2170
02:07:10.260 --> 02:07:15.120
here we are with Brennan Schwab,
Brendan UFC,
NFL comedy.

2171
02:07:15.330 --> 02:07:19.320
Where do you stop real quick,
how about the weather?
And had me read though,

2172
02:07:19.321 --> 02:07:21.750
and I went,
what?
And they go the route you want to do.

2173
02:07:21.751 --> 02:07:25.800
Take the weather from heroin.
Uh,
I've lived on it.
I'm like,

2174
02:07:25.801 --> 02:07:29.440
you want me to breach or whether we stick your butt out like that one.
Uh,

2175
02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:33.500
Mexican chick with a giant ass.
If you ever seen her.
Oh,
in the,

2176
02:07:33.890 --> 02:07:35.980
in the Mexico dude.
Who?
She

2177
02:07:35.980 --> 02:07:39.730
<v 0>makes me sweat.
I would read her while she Mexican or South American.
I forget.</v>

2178
02:07:39.731 --> 02:07:44.190
This is Max skin.
Oh,
mine too.
She is.
See,

2179
02:07:44.200 --> 02:07:48.040
that's different.
I would do that for you.
Jerk off into a cup.

2180
02:07:48.940 --> 02:07:52.660
Here she is.
Look at her.
Oh my God.
Look at what she's wearing.

2181
02:07:52.661 --> 02:07:56.200
Almost nothing to Udi.
Look at that booty.

2182
02:07:56.560 --> 02:07:59.140
They can't help but stare at Garcia.
What is her name?

2183
02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:03.400
Mexican Garcia.
Break the Internet.
Oh my God.

2184
02:08:03.670 --> 02:08:07.930
Her body is off the charts,
but a tool to they're doing it fucking right,

2185
02:08:07.931 --> 02:08:10.240
aren't they?
Yeah.
That's how you do it.
Yeah.

2186
02:08:10.241 --> 02:08:15.100
I mean who gives a fuck if she knows anything?
Who you know?

2187
02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:17.670
Who knows?
Who knows what's going on?
Three,

2188
02:08:17.671 --> 02:08:22.330
3 million of loud ass.
That is a blowout ass too.

2189
02:08:22.380 --> 02:08:27.250
Perfect.
Perfect body.
Look at her.
Look at her in her underwear.
Oh my God.

2190
02:08:27.820 --> 02:08:30.970
But she is gorgeous.
It's pretty God damn hot.

2191
02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:32.950
See now that makes sense.

2192
02:08:33.150 --> 02:08:35.610
It we should do is go out there and get down your underwear.

2193
02:08:35.611 --> 02:08:38.380
It's take your ass and need do some shows in Mexico.
It sounds,

2194
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:42.250
I can do some press there.
I said no press.
Oh correct.

2195
02:08:42.251 --> 02:08:45.700
And that's sounding the exams again,
whether I'm just here to do the weather.

2196
02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:49.490
Only here a talk about cloud.
She was a,

2197
02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:53.860
she just broke up with a pro gamer call of duty.
Oh,
so was single.
Huh?

2198
02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:58.750
She was dating a nerd.
That's amazing.
Rich nerds.
Nerds are coming up.
Rich nerd.

2199
02:08:59.050 --> 02:09:00.820
Those call of duty nerds are coming up.

2200
02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:04.180
Those video game was just heard about her recently for some reason and that's

2201
02:09:04.181 --> 02:09:08.350
what it was.
Pro gamers might as well be golfers now,
right,
to get paid.
Yeah,

2202
02:09:08.351 --> 02:09:12.560
right.
They might as well be golfers money damn.
And you tubers like right.

2203
02:09:12.580 --> 02:09:16.030
Like just straight youtubers.
A lot of them stupid money.

2204
02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:22.270
Hey,
no major network.
Nothing.
Nothing.
If you say,

2205
02:09:22.271 --> 02:09:25.060
if he s a fricking Logan,
Paul,
come on,
good morning America.

2206
02:09:25.061 --> 02:09:28.720
He's like socket flat her to uh,
work on call of duty.

2207
02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:33.010
He what dumped her to work on his call of duty.
You see this kid,

2208
02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:37.510
she wanted too much.
Dick.
I,
he's a handsome fella.
Handsome Fella.

2209
02:09:37.630 --> 02:09:41.200
He might have him us in the world.
Out Booty.
Yeah,
like other Dick.

2210
02:09:42.730 --> 02:09:47.620
How does he like pass up on her?
Just let her ride it while you playing the game.

2211
02:09:47.621 --> 02:09:49.510
Maybe she's terrible in bed though and he's like,

2212
02:09:49.570 --> 02:09:53.170
that's not even physically possible.
You know what?
You're right.
You're right.

2213
02:09:53.171 --> 02:09:56.260
You're right.
That's nine.
There's a bad Porsche to drive.

2214
02:09:56.261 --> 02:10:00.460
It's just now they're not all great.
Can fix it up.
There we go.
Oh Jesus Christ.

2215
02:10:00.461 --> 02:10:04.840
That's the two of them together and he broke up with her too.
I'm confused.

2216
02:10:04.841 --> 02:10:08.110
Is he ended cock.
He must.

2217
02:10:08.170 --> 02:10:11.160
There must be something wrong with his brain.
Look at him.
He's Jack though.
Dude.

2218
02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:15.280
He's,
he's probably nasty on the stakes.

2219
02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:19.510
Could googly mooglie today.
I would give lower all.
I'll get that.

2220
02:10:19.570 --> 02:10:23.320
Good Lord.
Good Lord.
Good Lord.

2221
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:27.970
The body and that lady did.
He dumped her.
I was like,

2222
02:10:28.660 --> 02:10:31.540
Listen man,

I'm out.

2223
02:10:31.541 --> 02:10:35.000
Pro gamers coming up in this world too,
and apparently it's a different life.

2224
02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:37.580
Drop some breaking news on her eyes.
Get tired of that one.

2225
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:41.390
Just like there's someone out there and say,
you know what I'm saying?

2226
02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:43.910
That's what I'm saying,
Jay Z.
That's what I heard.
But there's,
you know,

2227
02:10:43.911 --> 02:10:47.510
people get sick of it.
If you like it,
then you should've put a ring on it.

2228
02:10:47.890 --> 02:10:52.220
Oh,

Uh,

2229

2232

What do we got,

2233
02:11:05.901 --> 02:11:06.734

2234

I was going to say Anthony does,

2240
02:11:29.220 --> 02:11:33.140

2241
02:11:33.150 --> 02:11:37.980
big j doing a show at unseal and Brian a bitch sounds like better.

2242
02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:42.200
It sounds like more fun.
You should come with us.

Rich Cooper.

2255

She was joking though,
smelling her ass.

2258
02:12:46.631 --> 02:12:50.200
All the joking.
She's hilarious.
Yeah.
